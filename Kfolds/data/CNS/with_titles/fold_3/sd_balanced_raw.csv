1161,"Granulocytopenia associated with thymoma in a domestic shorthaired cat A 5-year-old, spayed female cat was referred because of a mass in the cranial mediastinum noted on thoracic radiographs. A thymoma was diagnosed following ultrasound and biopsy of the mass. Treatment was initiated with coarse-fraction radiation therapy using external-beam therapy (four fractions of 5 Gy). The mass responded, but granulocytopenia developed. Bone marrow examination showed a myeloid to erythroid ratio of approximately 1:1, with a left shift within the myeloid line. These findings, as well as the lack of toxic changes within the peripheral blood neutrophils, suggested immune-mediated destruction of peripheral granulocytes. Immune suppression with prednisone and cyclosporine was instituted. After 7 weeks, the neutrophil count returned to normal. The tumor was removed, and cyclosporine was reduced and eventually discontinued 3 weeks postsurgery.",Excluded

3582,"The relationship between mood symptoms and neuropsychological function in breast cancer survivors Objective: Breast cancer survivors show neuropsychological deficits in domains such as language and memory that are suspected to be a result of the harmful effects of cancer treatments. Mood symptoms may exacerbate these problems, however, little is known about the exact relationship between these variables. Participants and Methods: We examined a group of 87 breast cancer survivors, mean age 58.7 years, who had received diagnoses of breast cancer 2-22 years prior (mean 6.1 years). Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests that assessed intellectual function, executive function, and memory, and several self-report questionnaires that assessed mood, fatigue, and quality of life. Result(s): Pearson analyses demonstrated significant negative correlations between scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer & Brown, 1996) and the Full Scale IQ,VerbalComprehension Index, and Processing Speed Index scores of theWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III(Wechsler, 1997). BDI-II scores also showed significant negative correlations with some measures of executive function, but not with measures of memory. Analysis of variance showed that breast cancer survivors who had been treated with chemotherapy reported more symptoms of depression than individuals who had not been treated with chemotherapy, F = 9.51, p = .003. A similar pattern was not found for individuals who had been treated with radiation. Patients' history of chemotherapy and radiation treatment did not show any relationship to subsequent neuropsychological function. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that elevated mood symptoms may be related to problems in some domains of neuropsychological performance in breast cancer survivors. Individuals who had received chemotherapy appeared more likely to experience subsequent mood problems. Further investigation is needed to determine if mood changes may increase susceptibility to the cognitive deficits experienced by breast cancer survivors. Acknowledgement: Study funded by Susan G.

3159,"Morphometric analysis of hypothalamic cells showing c-Fos proteins after movement restriction and EHF-irradiation A morphometric analysis of hypothalamic cells containing c-Fos-like protein detected by an indirect immunoperoxidase method was carried out to clarify the responses to movement restriction and skin electromagnetic high frequency (EHF) irradiation (7.1 mm, 42.2 GHz, 20 mW output power) simultaneously to three acupuncture projection areas. The morphometry of c-Fos-protein positive neurons by their number and type was analyzed. Movement restriction (40 min) induced c-Fos protein expression primarily in cells with 10-50 mum<sup>2</sup> sizes (associative type neurons) only in anterior hypothalamic nucleus and lateral hypothalamic area; while additional EHF-irradiation of acupuncture projection areas (under movement restriction) induced c-Fos expression in all hypothalamic structures and mostly in cells with 70-150 mum<sup>2</sup> sizes (relay type neurons), i.e. changed the pattern of activated cell type distribution. In conclusion, the findings show that modest stress under which experimental animals often are exposed increase c-Fos protein expression in hypothalamic centers and skin EHF-irradiation of acupuncture projection areas seem to increase that.

2040,"Radiation as a local ablative therapy option for oligoprogressive EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with osimertinib Purpose/Objective(s): Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved response rate and survival in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their efficacy is limited by acquired resistance and disease progression. Local ablative therapy (LAT) has shown a survival benefit in patients with oligometastatic disease in retrospective studies. At our institution, we are conducting a prospective single-arm Phase 2 study of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI. Following LAT to the sites of progression with either radiation or surgery, patients are re-initiated on osimertinib. The primary endpoints are safety, tolerability, and efficacy of re-initiation of osimertinib, as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS). We hypothesize that osimertinib and radiation can be safely administered sequentially, and that LAT followed by re-initiation of osimertinib will result in improved PFS. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with no prior EGFR-TKI exposure (cohort 1) or progression after 1st/2nd generation EGFR-TKIs with acquired T790M mutation (cohort 2) receive osimertinib. Upon progression, eligible patients with <=5 progressing sites undergo LAT by either radiation therapy or surgery, then resume osimertinib until further disease progression. Patients previously treated with osimertinib with disease progression who qualify for LAT are also eligible (cohort 3). Prior to beginning radiation, patients must be off osimertinib for at least 2 wks, and total time off osimertinib must be less than 8 wks. Result(s): Fifteen patients with a median age of 57 (range 36-71) were enrolled between 4/2016 and 1/2017 (cohorts 1/2/3: 9/3/3 patients). Overall, treatment has been well tolerated, with rash, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and alanine transaminase elevation the most common adverse events (AEs). Grade 3-4 AEs were observed in 4 (27%) patients. Objective response rates among evaluable patients prior to LAT in cohorts 1 and 2 were 71% (5/7) and 100% (2/2), respectively. Median PFS was 6.8 mo (95% CI: 3.4 mo-undefined) in cohort 1; there have been no progressions in cohort 2. To date, 2/5 patients receiving LAT have received radiation (both in cohort 3). One patient received 5 Gy x 5 to 2 lung lesions, while the other received 24 Gy and 18 Gy by stereotactic radiosurgery to 2 brain metastases. Additional endpoints include assessment of mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib by multi-omics analyses of tumor, blood, and saliva; results from these analyses will also be presented. Conclusion(s): Oligoprogressive disease can be safely treated with LAT, including radiation therapy, in patients with limited metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC after EGFR-TKI therapy. This approach could potentially prevent premature switching to other, less-effective systemic therapies by maximizing the duration and efficacy of EGFR-TKI treatment in selected patients.",Excluded
3081,"Low-dose radiation enhances survivin-mediated virotherapy against malignant glioma stem cells To improve the efficacy and selectivity of virotherapy for malignant glioma, we designed a strategy to amplify adenoviral replication in conjunction with radiotherapy using a radioinducible promoter. First, we compared the radiation-inducible activity of FLT-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, DR5, Cox2, and survivin. We then examined the capacity of the optimal promoter to modulate transgene expression followed by E1A activity in vitro and in vivo in a glioma stem cell model. In the presence of radiation, survivin mRNA activity increased 10-fold. Luciferase transgene expression was dose dependent and optimal at 2 Gy. A novel oncolytic adenovirus, CRAd-Survivin-pk7, showed significant toxicity and replication against a panel of passaged and primary CD133(+) glioma stem cells. On delivery of radiation, the toxicity associated with CRAd-Survivin-pk7 increased by 20% to 50% (P < 0.05). At the same time, the level of E1A activity increased 3- to 10-fold. In vivo, treatment of U373MG CD133(+) stem cells with CRAd-Survivin-pk7 and radiation significantly inhibited tumor growth (P < 0.05). At the same time, the level of E1A activity was 100-fold increased versus CRAd-Survivin-pk7 alone. Selected genes linked to radioinducible promoters whose expression can be regulated by ionizing radiation may improve the therapeutic ratio of virotherapy. In this study, we have identified a new radioinducible promoter, survivin, which greatly enhances the activity of an oncolytic adenovirus in the presence of low-dose radiotherapy.",Excluded

1062,"Carotid ultrasound identifies high risk subclinical atherosclerosis in adults with low framingham risk scores BACKGROUND: Worldwide, cardiovascular (CV) disease remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality. Although effective in predicting CV risk in select populations, the Framingham risk score (FRS) fails to identify many young individuals who experience premature CV events. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) or plaque, a marker of atherosclerosis and predictor of CV events, in young asymptomatic individuals with low and intermediate FRS (<2% annualized event rate) using the carotid ultrasound protocol recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Vascular Medicine.METHODS: Individuals aged < or = 65 years not taking statins and without diabetes mellitus or histories of coronary artery disease underwent CIMT and plaque examination for primary prevention. Clinical variables including lipid values, family history of premature coronary artery disease, and FRS and subsequent pharmacotherapy recommendations were retrospectively collected for statistical analysis.RESULTS: Of 441 subjects (mean age, 49.7 + or - 7.9 years), 184 (42%; 95% confidence interval, 37.3%-46.5%) had high-risk carotid ultrasound findings (CIMT > or = 75th percentile adjusted for age, gender, and race or presence of plaque). Of those with the lowest FRS of < or =5% (n = 336) (mean age, 48.0 + or - 7.6 years; mean FRS, 2.5 + or - 1.5%), 127 (38%; 95% confidence interval, 32.6%-43.0%) had high-risk carotid ultrasound findings. For individuals with FRS < or = 5% and high-risk carotid ultrasound findings (n = 127; mean age, 47.3 + or - 8.1 years; mean FRS, 2.5 + or - 1.5%), lipid-lowering therapy was recommended by their treating physicians in 77 (61%).CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-eight percent of asymptomatic young to middle-aged individuals with FRS < or = 5% have abnormal carotid ultrasound findings associated with increased risk for CV events. Pharmacologic therapy for CV prevention was recommended in the majority of these individuals. The lack of radiation exposure, relatively low cost, and ability to detect early-stage atherosclerosis suggest that carotid ultrasound for CIMT and plaque detection should continue to be explored as a primary tool for CV risk stratification in young to middle-aged adults with low FRS.",Excluded

2971,"A Comparison between X-Ray and Carbon Ion Irradiation in Human Neural Stem Cells Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by a poor prognosis and a median survival of ~12-18 months. GBM is usually managed by neurosurgery followed by both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since GBM develops resistance to conventional therapies, treatment with C-ions is promising to completely eradicate the tumoural mass. During cranial irradiation, exposure of healthy tissues is inevitable. Because of the presence of neural stem cells, a deep investigation on the effects of C-ion irradiation with respect to X-ray induced damage is mandatory to allow a better definition of treatments. In this work, the comparison of X-rays and C-ion irradiation-induced effects on human neural stem cell, focusing on multiple endpoints, such as cell viability, cytokine secretion and spheroid formation is presented. Results show different temporal and dose responses of human neural stem cells to the different radiation qualities, suggesting different underpinning mechanisms of radiation-induced damages.",Included
654,"Gut flora-targeted photobiomodulation therapy improves senile dementia in an As-induced Alzheimer's disease animal model BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy is believed to have a positive regulatory effect on the imbalance of certain body functions, including inflammation, immunity, wound healing, nerve repair, and pain. Previous studies have found that the intestinal flora of patients with AD is in an unbalanced state. Therefore, we have proposed the use of gut flora-targeted PBM (gf-targeted PBM) as a method to improve AD in an As-induced AD mouse model.METHODS: PBM was performed on the abdomen of the mice at the wavelengths of 630 nm, 730 nm, and 850 nm at 100 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for 8 weeks. Morris water maze test, immunofluorescence and proteomic of hippocampus, and intestinal flora detection of fecal were used to evaluate the treatment effects of gf-targeted PBM on AD rats.RESULTS: PBM at all three wavelengths (especially 630 nm and 730 nm) significantly improved learning retention as measured by the Morris water maze. In addition, we found reduced amyloidosis and tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus by immunofluorescence in AD mice. By using a quantitative proteomic analysis of the hippocampus, we found that gf-targeted PBM significantly altered the expression levels of 509 proteins (the same differentially expressed proteins in all three wavelengths of PBM), which involved the pathways of hormone synthesis, phagocytosis, and metabolism. The 16 s rRNA gene sequencing of fecal contents showed that PBM significantly altered the diversity and abundance of intestinal flora. Specifically, PBM treatment reversed the typical increase of Helicobacter and uncultured Bacteroidales and the decrease of Rikenella seen in AD mice.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that gf-targeted PBM regulates the diversity of intestinal flora, which may improve damage caused by AD. Gf-targeted PBM has the potential to be a noninvasive microflora regulation method for AD patients.",Excluded

Results and discussion. These investigations showed that a significantly greater proportion of subjects exposed to radiation during antenatal development had nonpsychotic mental disorders with a predominance of organic mental impairments (cognitive and asthenic). Neurophysiological studies identified more profound abnormalities in brain bioelectrical activity with pathological rhythms and a predominance of the theta rhythm among those exposed to radiation. Clinical psychological study data identified a significant decrease in analytical-synthetic ability in irradiated subjects, along with lower general and verbal IQ levels. These changes were accompanied by higher cortisol and melatonin levels, supporting activation of and tension in the mechanisms of adaptation in subjects irradiated during antenatal development.

3492,"The homeobox transcription factor Even-skipped regulates acquisition of electrical properties in Drosophila neurons BACKGROUND: While developmental processes such as axon pathfinding and synapse formation have been characterized in detail, comparatively less is known of the intrinsic developmental mechanisms that regulate transcription of ion channel genes in embryonic neurons. Early decisions, including motoneuron axon targeting, are orchestrated by a cohort of transcription factors that act together in a combinatorial manner. These transcription factors include Even-skipped (Eve), islet and Lim3. The perdurance of these factors in late embryonic neurons is, however, indicative that they might also regulate additional aspects of neuron development, including the acquisition of electrical properties.RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that a combinatorial code transcription factor is also able to influence the acquisition of electrical properties in embryonic neurons we utilized the molecular genetics of Drosophila to manipulate the expression of Eve in identified motoneurons. We show that increasing expression of this transcription factor, in two Eve-positive motoneurons (aCC and RP2), is indeed sufficient to affect the electrical properties of these neurons in early first instar larvae. Specifically, we observed a decrease in both the fast K+ conductance (IKfast) and amplitude of quantal cholinergic synaptic input. We used charybdotoxin to pharmacologically separate the individual components of IKfast to show that increased Eve specifically down regulates the Slowpoke (a BK Ca2+-gated potassium channel), but not Shal, component of this current. Identification of target genes for Eve, using DNA adenine methyltransferase identification, revealed strong binding sites in slowpoke and nAcRalpha-96Aa (a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit). Verification using real-time PCR shows that pan-neuronal expression of eve is sufficient to repress transcripts for both slo and nAcRalpha-96Aa.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that Eve is sufficient to regulate both voltage- and ligand-gated currents in motoneurons, extending its known repertoire of action beyond its already characterized role in axon guidance. Our data are also consistent with a common developmental program that utilizes a defined set of transcription factors to determine both morphological and functional neuronal properties.",Excluded

2112,"Sensitization and habituation of AMH and C-fiber related percepts of repetitive radiant heat stimulation OBJECTIVE: Pain perception involves neuronal plasticity at peripheral and central stages, resulting in sensitization or habituation, depending on intensity and temporal features of stimulation. Concurrent assessment of perceptual change over different time spans is therefore important for understanding the dynamics of pain processing.METHODS: A new psychophysical procedure was established to assess sensitization and habituation during repetitive radiant heat stimulation. Short-term perceptual change (<1 min) during trials with 10 stimuli applied at 3 frequencies (0.2-0.6-1.8 Hz) and 3 intensities was assessed for AMH-II or C-fiber related percepts. Perceptual changes were monitored for medium-term (1-15 min) and for long-term (15-90 min) time spans.RESULTS: Short-term sensitization occurred only at frequencies above 0.3 Hz and was affected by both stimulus frequency and intensity, but the AMH-fiber related sensitization depended on intensity only above 0.6 Hz. Multiple stimulation of the same skin area during medium-term time spans resulted in habituation. No long-term perceptual changes occurred.CONCLUSIONS: The procedure permits concurrent assessment of short-term sensitization and medium-term habituation, assumed to be related to spinal windup and cutaneous nociceptive fiber fatigue, respectively.SIGNIFICANCE: The method is suitable for quantitative sensory testing of dynamic pain processing over different time spans, relevant in clinical testing of pain and in drug assessment.",Excluded

To characterize the difference of Ku70 distribution between cells of human tissues and cultured cells, the expression of Ku70 was examined in various normal and neoplastic human tissues by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot. In addition, the role of Ku70 in the cellular response against ionizing radiation (IR) was analysed in fibroblasts after exposure to 5 Gy IR and apoptotic indices were examined in Ku70-overexpressed fibroblasts from an ataxia telangiectasia patient and in normal fibroblasts, before and after irradiation. In contrast to cultured cells, Ku70 was not detected in some interphase cells of human tissues and was distributed heterogeneously, even in the same nucleus. Ku70 expression was strikingly low in terminally differentiated cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, glomerular capillary endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and was absent in spermatids. In spermatocytes, Ku70 was tightly integrated with chromosome filaments, unlike other somatic cells under mitosis. After exposure to IR, Ku70 expression was not increased in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts, but was significantly increased in normal fibroblasts. Most of the increased Ku70 was of soluble nuclear protein fraction. Furthermore, overexpression of Ku70 increased radiation resistance both in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts.

V1bR knockout (KO) mice displayed significantly reduced levels of PPI of the startle reflex. In addition to PPI deficits, V1bR KO mice showed increased acoustic startle response. However, acoustic startle response was not significantly correlated to the PPI of the startle reflex in V1bR KO mice.

However, this effect has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients. We have currently found a technical solution to this problem. Our current protocol for WBRT+SIB is presented and described, incluiding a retrospective review of the results in relation to radiation-induced alopecia. Material(s) and Method(s): The protocol already implemented in our department is based on a frame-less procedure compatible with masks of type 35764/2MA/M (Orfit Industries N.V., Wijnegem, Belgium), submasks of eXaSkin (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain) and a resonance compatible frame eXaFrame (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain). CT and MR studies of 1mm slice thickness are acquired with similar length, position and inmovilization. The whole procedure and the resulting high quality fussion is ensured by the eXaFrame system. Treatments were designed using VMAT in Treatment System Planning Pinnacle V.9.2 (Philips N.V, Koninklijke Holland) with multiple arcs, and delivered with a linear accelerator Elekta Synergy (Elekta A.B., Stockholm, Sweden). The dose scheme used is the one reported by Lagerwaard: [WBRT(20Gy) + SIBmts (40Gy)]/5 fr. Patient positioning is verified daily using IGRT with Elekta XVI, before and after treatment. Before optimization is performed, some auxiliary volumes are created: a 3mm ring around calota,called Follicles, and a volume contracted 12mm from the outer one, called CPE. Two CCW VMAT arcs (178degree to 60degree and 300degree to 182degree) are added, with the following objectives: Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 1), brain-CPE (D<inf>max</inf>= 21 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 20 Gy, weight = 50), eyes(D<inf>max</inf>= 10 Gy, weight = 1). Thereafter, we work separately on the metastases blocking the optimization of the prophylaxis and creating three structures: VI1 = PTV (MTS1)+ 5 mm, VI2 = PTV (MTS2)+ 5 mm, Epx = brain-VI1-VI2. Objectives were: PTVI (D<inf>max</inf>= 44 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 40 Gy weight = 50), Epx (D<inf>max</inf>= 30 Gy) ,brain stem (D<inf>max</inf>= 23 Gy) and Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 20).

No acute toxicity have been observed, including neither alopecia nor temporal depilation. Conclusion(s): This protocol has been designed and developed in our hospital, considering the alopecia as toxicity in VMAT optimization. It produces excellent cosmetic results, avoiding alopecia in practically all cases, which has a direct impact on patient quality of life.

Survival outcomes were retrospectively analysed in a consecutive series of 67 newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients who had received either conventional fractionated photon radiotherapy (CRT) or high-dose particle radiotherapy (HDT). In the CRT protocol, a total dose of 60.0-61.2 Gy was administered. In the HDT protocol, an average dose of approximately 30 GyE in a single session and additional fractionated photon irradiation of total dose 30 Gy were administered to patients receiving boron neutron capture therapy; and a total dose of 96.6 GyE was administered to patients receiving proton therapy. Most of the patients had received chemotherapy with nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) alone or with ACNU, procarbazine and vincristine. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival times for all patients were 17.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.6-20.9 months] and 7.8 months (95% CI, 5.7-9.9 months), respectively. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 67.2% and 33.7%, respectively. For patients treated with HDT, the median OS was 24.4 months (95% CI, 18.2-30.5 months), compared with 14.2 months (95% CI, 10.0-18.3 months) for those treated with CRT. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed radiation modality (HDT vs CRT) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recursive partitioning analysis class to be the significant prognostic factors. Age, sex, pre-operative performance status, treatment with or without advanced neuroimaging, extent of surgery and regimen of chemotherapy were not statistically significant factors in predicting prognosis. The median OS was 18.5 months (95% CI, 9.9-27.1 months) in patients of 65 years and older, compared with 16.8 months (95% CI, 13.6-20.1 months) in those 64 years and younger (p=0.871). The positive effect of HDT treatment is unlikely to reflect patient selection alone. Randomised trials with strictly controlled inclusion criteria to ensure the comparable selection of patients are required to demonstrate conclusively that prolonged survival can be attributed to high-dose particle radiotherapies.",Excluded

Multivariate analysis was performed to analyze patient total dose area product (DAP) and neurointerventionalist dose variability in terms of clinical characteristics and the technical parameters of thrombectomies. Local dose reference levels (RL) were derived as the 75th percentile of the patient dose distributions.RESULTS: A total of 179 patients were treated during the study period and included in this study. Local dose RL for thrombectomy was derived for total DAP to 34 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>, cumulative air kerma of 242 mGy and fluoroscopy time of 12 min. The mean neurointerventionalist dose for thrombectomy was 7.7 +/- 7.4 microSv.

Operable patients had thoracotomy followed by IDG. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), 2.0 Gy x 15 fractions with a total dose of 30 Gy in 3 weeks, was given to the complete responders (CR) after completion of chemotherapy. In the concurrent (CON) trial, patients received DDP 60 mg/M<sup>2</sup> IV Day 1, and etoposide 120 mg/M<sup>2</sup> IV Days 1-3 for four cycles, every 3 weeks, and concurrent thoracic radiation therapy to 45 Gy with either 1.8 Gy daily, for 5 weeks or 1.5 Gy bid for 3 weeks. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was given to the complete responders, 2.5 Gy daily for 2 weeks (25 Gy) (approximately 3 months after the initiation of treatment). Result(s): The IDG group had 28 evaluable patients with median follow-up of 17.5 months. The CON group had 33 evaluable patients with median follow-up of 21 months. Overall survival rates for IDG patients were 79% at 1 year, 39% at 2 years, 30% at 3 years, and 27% at 4 years compared to 93%, 70%, 51%, and 46%, respectively, for the patients treated with CON (p = 0.01). Loco-regional recurrence (44%) and distant metastasis (48%) was more frequent as the first site of failure in the IDG group compared to the CON group (30% and 30%, respectively). Brain metastases constituted 30% of first metastases with IDG compared to none with CON. Esophagitis was significantly greater with CON. Hematologic and pulmonary toxicity were similar with IDG and CON. One death due to infection was seen in each treatment group. Conclusion(s): Concurrent chemoradiotherapy appears to be more effective than IDG.

We review these recent studies, and when effects were observed, we reference the time course of observed effects (immediate or delayed). In our concluding remarks, we discuss a number of variables that are not often considered in human bioelectromagnetics studies, such as personality, individual differences and the specific laterality of ELF MF and mobile phone exposure over the brain.

3354,"Implementation of the structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index as a quantitative evaluation tool for dose distribution error detection PURPOSE: To apply an imaging metric of the structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index to the radiotherapy dose verification field and evaluate its capability to reveal the different types of errors between two dose distributions.METHOD: The SSIM index consists of three sub-indices: luminance, contrast, and structure. Given two images, luminance analysis compares the local mean result, contrast analysis compares the local standard deviation, and the structure index represents the local Pearson correlation. Three test error patterns (absolute dose error, dose gradient error, and dose structure error) were designed to characterize the response of SSIM and its sub-indices and establish the correlation between the indices and different dose error types. After establishing the correlation, four radiotherapy plans (one MLC picket-fence test plan, one brain stereotactic radiotherapy plan, and two head-and-neck plans) were tested by computing each index and compared with the gamma analysis results to determine their similarities and differences.RESULTS: Among the three test error patterns, the luminance index decreased from 1 to 0.1 when the absolute dose agreement fell from 100% to 5%, the contrast index decreased from 1 to 0.36 when the dose gradient agreement fell from 100% to 10%, and the structure index decreased from 1 to 0.23 when the periodical dose pattern shifted (leading to a lower correlation). Thus, the luminance, contrast and structure index can detect the absolute dose error, gradient discrepancy, and dose structure error, respectively. For the four clinical cases, the sub-indices can reveal the type of error when gamma analysis only provided limited information.CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between the subcomponents of the SSIM index and the error types of the dose distribution were established. The SSIM index provides additional error information compared to that provided by gamma analysis.",Excluded
2991,"Dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prime candidate for image-guided radiotherapy. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences.METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system.RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded

Despite this, incurable distant metastases develop within 5 years in 15% of men with very high-risk features. Darolutamide is a structurally distinct oral androgen receptor antagonist with low blood-brain-barrier penetration, a demonstrated favorable safety profile and low potential for drug-drug interactions. Our aim is to determine the efficacy of adding darolutamide to ADT and RT in the setting of either primary definitive therapy, or adjuvant therapy for very high-risk PC. Method(s): This study is a randomized (1:1) phase III placebo-controlled, double-blind trial for men planned for RT who have very high-risk localized PC; or very high-risk features with PSA persistence or rise within one year following RP. The trial will be stratified by: RP; use of adjuvant docetaxel; pelvic nodal involvement. 1100 participants will be randomized to darolutamide 600 mg or placebo twice daily for 96 weeks. Participants will receive LHRHA for 96 weeks, plus RT starting week 8-24 from randomisation. Participants are allowed nonsteroidal antiandrogen (up to 90 days) in addition to LHRHA up until randomisation.

2944,"Cancer incidence after localized therapy for prostate cancer BACKGROUND: Second cancers may occur in patients who have undergone radiation therapy. The risk for these adverse events after therapy is uncertain. In this study, the authors examined the size and significance of the observed association between occurrences of secondary cancers 5 years after radiotherapy in a large population of men with incident prostate cancer.METHODS: Men with incident prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and were distinguished by the type of treatment received, tumor stage, tumor grade, and age at diagnosis. SEER data also were used to identify occurrences of secondary cancer beginning 5 years after the date patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds of the subsequent occurrence of other cancers associated with types of radiation therapy received and was adjusted for the type of surgery, tumor grade, stage, and patient age.RESULTS: Compared with men who received no prostate cancer-directed radiation, men who received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as their only form of radiation therapy had statistically significant increased odds of developing secondary cancers at several sites potentially related to radiation therapy, including the bladder (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.44-1.84) and rectum (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.29-1.99). Men who received EBRT also had statistically significant higher odds of developing secondary cancers at sites in the upper body and other areas not potentially related to radiation therapy, including the cecum (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70), transverse colon (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30-2.63), brain (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22-2.75), stomach (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75), melanoma (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53), and lung and bronchus (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) compared with the odds among men who received no radiation therapy. Men who received radiation therapy in the form of radioactive implants or isotopes, either in isolation or combined with beam radiation, did not have significantly different odds of secondary cancer occurring at any of the 20 most common sites.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received with EBRT had significantly higher odds of developing second cancers both overall and in the areas that were exposed to radiation.

However, little is known about the long-term effects of combined microgravity and low-dose radiation. We exposed mice to gamma radiation using a cobalt-57 plate (0.01 cGy/h for a total dose of 0.04 Gy), hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, or a combination of both for 3 weeks. Mice then underwent a behavioral test battery after 1 week, 1 month, 4 months, and 8 months to assess sensorimotor coordination/balance (rotarod), activity levels (open field), learned helplessness/depression-like behavior (tail suspension test), risk-taking (elevated zero maze), and spatial learning/memory (water maze). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression was assessed in the brain after behavioral testing to determine blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Mice that received unloading spent significantly more time in the exposed portions of the elevated zero maze, were hypoactive in the open field, and spent less time struggling on the tail suspension test than mice that did not receive unloading. Mice in the combination group expressed more AQP4 immunoactivity than controls. Elevated zero maze and AQP4 data were correlated. No differences were seen on the water maze or rotarod, and no radiation-only effects were observed. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to BBB dysfunction.",Included

A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients.

336,"Melatonin receptor density in Area X of European starlings is correlated with reproductive state and is unaffected by plasma melatonin concentration Several of the song control nuclei of songbirds, including HVc (higher vocal center) and Area X, contain melatonin receptor (MelR). In laboratory-housed male starlings, the densities of MelR in Area X change markedly according to reproductive state. MelR are down-regulated when starlings are photostimulated (in full breeding condition) and are subsequently up-regulated when starlings become photorefractory (reproductively quiescent). However, seasonal regulation of MelR densities in Area X has only been investigated during the light phase of the light:dark cycle. Variation in MelR densities are physiologically relevant only if they also occur during the dark phase, when melatonin is present in the circulation. Brains from male starlings that were in different reproductive states but exposed to the same 18L:6D photoperiod were collected during either the mid-point of the light phase or the dark phase. Melatonin receptor distribution was assessed in vitro by 125Iodomelatonin (IMEL) receptor autoradiography. All photostimulated birds exhibited down-regulation of MelR in Area X, and all photorefractory birds exhibited high MelR density in Area X, regardless of time of sampling or plasma melatonin concentration. Thus, within each reproductive state, MelR density in Area X did not differ over the course of a circadian cycle. The functional significance of seasonal regulation of MelR in this song control nucleus remains unclear, but it is likely to involve a release of cellular inhibition by melatonin during photostimulation, with possible consequences for song learning, memory consolidation or regulation of the context of song production.",Excluded

The ATM protein kinase is a master regulator of the response to double-strand breaks (DSBs), the most cytotoxic DNA lesion caused by ionizing radiation. ATM is the protein missing or inactive in patients with the pleiotropic genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A major response to DNA damage is altered expression of numerous genes. While studying gene expression in control and A-T cells following treatment with the radiomimetic chemical neocarzinostatin (NCS), we identified an expressed sequence tag that represented a gene that was induced by DSBs in an ATM-dependent manner. The corresponding cDNA encoded a dual specificity phosphatase of the MAP kinase phosphatase family, MKP-5. MKP-5 dephosphorylates and inactivates the stress-activated MAP kinases JNK and p38. The phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of JNK and p38 by NCS was attenuated in A-T cells. Thus, ATM modulates this cycle in response to DSBs. These results further highlight ATM as a link between the DNA damage response and major signaling pathways involved in proliferative and apoptotic processes.",Excluded

Higher doses (25-35 cGy), however, could not induce such effects. We also obtained the data on brain biochemistry giving a further support for the above low-dose effects on the mouse behavior.

The patients were divided into three groups, according to the time following completion of RT. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and gray matter (GM) volume were determined. The DTI data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics and the GM volume was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Compared with the pre-RT group, the mean FA values in the left parietal lobe white matter (WM) and right cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05). In addition, the mean FA values in the right parietal lobe WM decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05), compared with the pre-RT group. The FA level in the right temporal lobe remained significantly decreased, compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT. Furthermore, compared with pre-RT group, the GM volume in the bilateral frontal lobe, right occipital lobe, left parietal lobe, right temporal lobe and left cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05), and in the bilateral temporal lobe, parietal lobe, right frontal lobe and left cerebellum, the GM volume decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05). The GM volume in the right temporal lobe, bilateral frontal lobe and bilateral cerebellum remained significantly decreased compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT. A combination of DTI and VBM may be used to determine radiation-induced brain injury in patients treated for NPC. Copyright Â© 2017, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
1233,"White matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging following whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate white matter (WM) abnormalities induced by WBRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients (11 men and 13 women; age range 38-74 years, median 60 years) who survived for more than 1 year after completion of WBRT (radiation dose range 30-40 Gy, median 35 Gy) at our institution between January 2000 and June 2003 were followed up with magnetic resonance (MR) scans for 11-51 months (median 19 months). We evaluated WM changes attributable to WBRT as grade 0-6 and assessed possible contributing factors by statistical analysis.RESULTS: WM changes were found in 20 patients: Eight were assessed as grade 2, three as grade 3, and nine as grade 5. In total, 12 patients developed grade 3 or higher WM changes. Age (<60 vs > or =60 years), sex, radiation dose (< or =35 vs >35 Gy), chemotherapy (with CDDP vs without CDDP), biologically effective dose (< or =120 vs >120 Gy1), and head width (<16.3 vs > or =16.3 cm) were found not to be relevant to the incidence or severity of the WM changes.CONCLUSION: Long-term survivors who have under-gone WBRT may have a higher incidence of WM abnormalities.",Excluded
3000,"Acute vagus nerve stimulation using different pulse widths produces varying brain effects BACKGROUND: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved treatment for epilepsy and has been investigated in clinical trials of depression. Little is known about the relationship of VNS parameters to brain function. Using the interleaved VNS /functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, we tested whether variations of VNS pulse width (PW) would produce different immediate brain activation in a manner consistent with single neuron PW studies.METHODS: Twelve adult patients with major depression, treated with VNS, underwent three consecutive VNS/fMRI scans, each randomly using one of three PWs (130 micros, 250 micros, or 500 micros). The data were analyzed with SPM2.RESULTS: Global activations induced by PWs 250 and 500 were both significantly greater than that induced by PW 130 but not significantly different from each other. For global deactivation, PWs 130 and 250 were both significantly greater than PW 500 but not significantly different from each other. Regional similarities and differences were also seen with the various PWs.CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm our hypothesis that VNS at PW 500 globally produces no more activation than does PW 250, and PW 130 is insufficient for activation of some regions. These data suggest that PW is an important variable in producing VNS brain effects.",Excluded
41,"Long-term correlation of the electrocorticogram as a bioindicator of brain exposure to ionizing radiation Understanding the effects of radiation and its possible influence on the nervous system are of great clinical interest.However, there have been few electrophysiological studies on brain activity after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR).A new methodological approach regarding the assessment of the possible effects of IR on brain activity is the use of linear and nonlinear mathematical methods in the analysis of complex time series, such as brain oscillations measured using the electrocorticogram (ECoG).The objective of this study was to use linear and nonlinear mathematical methods as biomarkers of gamma radiation regarding cortical electrical activity.Adult Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: 1 control and 2 irradiated groups, evaluated at 24 h (IR24) and 90 days (IR90) after exposure to 18 Gy of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 radiotherapy source.The ECoG was analyzed using power spectrum methods for the calculation of the power of delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms and by means of the alpha-exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).Using both mathematical methods it was possible to identify changes in the ECoG, and to identify significant changes in the pattern of the recording at 24 h after irradiation.Some of these changes were persistent at 90 days after exposure to IR.In particular, the theta wave using the two methods showed higher sensitivity than other waves, suggesting that it is a possible biomarker of exposure to IR.

1443,"Driver or coincidence detector: modal switch of a corticothalamic giant synapse controlled by spontaneous activity and short-term depression Giant synapses between layer 5B (L5B) neurons of somatosensory (barrel) cortex and neurons of the posteromedial nucleus (POm) of thalamus reside in a key position of the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loop, yet their synaptic properties and contribution to CTC information processing remain poorly understood. Fluorescence-guided local stimulation of terminals were combined with postsynaptic whole-cell recordings in thalamus to study synaptic transmission at an identified giant synapse. We found large EPSCs mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and NMDA receptors. A single presynaptic electrical stimulus evoked a train of postsynaptic action potentials, indicating that a single L5B input can effectively drive the thalamic neuron. Repetitive stimulation caused strong short-term depression (STD) with fast recovery. To examine how these synaptic properties affect information transfer, spontaneous and evoked activity of L5B neurons was recorded in vivo and played back to giant terminals in vitro. We found that suprathreshold synaptic transmission was suppressed because of spontaneous activity causing strong STD of the L5B-POm giant synapse. Thalamic neurons only spiked after intervals of presynaptic silence or when costimulating two giant terminals. Therefore, STD caused by spontaneous activity of L5B neurons can switch the synapse from a ""driver mode"" to a ""coincidence mode."" Mechanisms decreasing spontaneous activity in L5B neurons and inputs synchronized by a sensory stimulus may thus gate the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop.",Excluded

Method(s): Histologically proven glioblastoma patients underwent IMRT dose escalation. IMRT was delivered over 5 weeks with the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique to the two planning target volumes (PTVs) defined by adding 5-mm margin to the respective clinical target volumes (CTVs). CTV1 was the tumor bed plus the enhancing lesion with 10-mm margin; CTV2 was the area of perifocal edema with 20-mm margin. Only the PTV1 dose was escalated (planned dose escalation: 60, 62.5, 65, 67.5, 70 Gy) while the PTV2 dose remained the same (45 Gy). Result(s): Forty consecutive glioblastoma patients were treated. While no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was recorded during the dose escalation up to 67.5/2.7 Gy, two out of the first six consecutively enrolled patients on the highest dose level (70/2.8 Gy) experienced a DLT, and therefore a cohort expansion was required. 3/14 patients experienced a DLT on the highest planned dose level, and therefore the MTD was not exceeded. After a median follow-up time of 25 months no grade >2 late neurological toxicity was recorded. Conclusion(s): By using a SIB IMRT technique, a radiation dose of 70 Gy in 25 fractions (biological effective dose - BED - of 92.8 Gy) can be delivered with concurrent and sequential standard dose TMZ, without unacceptable acute toxicity in patients with glioblastoma.

3600,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [11C]raclopride in healthy volunteers PURPOSE: This study reports on the whole-body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [11C]raclopride, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist.METHODS: In three healthy male volunteers, whole-body scans were performed up to 2 h following i.v. injection of 320+/-65 MBq [11C]raclopride. Transmission scans (3 min per step, eight or nine steps according to the height of the subject) in 2D mode were used for subsequent attenuation correction of emission scans. Emission scans (1 min per step, eight or nine steps) were acquired over 2 h. Venous blood samples and urine were collected up to 2 h after injection of the radiotracer. For each subject, the percentage of injected activity measured in regions of interest over brain, intestine, lungs, kidneys and liver was fitted to a mono-exponential model, as an uptake phase followed by a mono-exponential washout, for urinary bladder to generate time-activity curves. Using the MIRD method, several source organs were considered in estimating residence time and mean effective radiation absorbed doses.RESULTS: Blood pressure and ECG findings remained unchanged after tracer injection. The analysed blood and urine pharmacological parameters did not change significantly after [(11)C]raclopride injection. The primary routes of clearance were renal and intestinal. Ten minutes after injection, high activities were observed in the gall-bladder, kidneys and liver. High activity was observed in the gall-bladder during the whole study. The kidneys, urinary bladder wall, liver and gall-bladder received the highest absorbed doses. The average effective dose of [11C]raclopride was estimated to be 6.7+/-0.4 microSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: The amount of [11C]raclopride required for adequate dopamine D2 receptor imaging results in an acceptable effective dose equivalent, permitting two or three repeated clinical PET imaging studies, with the injection of 222 MBq for each study.",Excluded

540,"Calcium-induced calcium release in rod photoreceptor terminals boosts synaptic transmission during maintained depolarization We examined the contribution of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) to synaptic transmission from rod photoreceptor terminals. Whole-cell recording and confocal calcium imaging experiments were conducted on rods with intact synaptic terminals in a retinal slice preparation from salamander. Low concentrations of ryanodine stimulated calcium increases in rod terminals, consistent with the presence of ryanodine receptors. Application of strong depolarizing steps (-70 to -10 mV) exceeding 200 ms or longer in duration evoked a wave of calcium that spread across the synaptic terminals of voltage-clamped rods. This secondary calcium increase was blocked by high concentrations of ryanodine, indicating it was due to CICR. Ryanodine (50 microm) had no significant effect on rod calcium current (I(ca)) although it slightly diminished rod light-evoked voltage responses. Bath application of 50 microm ryanodine strongly inhibited light-evoked currents in horizontal cells. Whether applied extracellularly or delivered into the rod cell through the patch pipette, ryanodine (50 microm) also inhibited excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked in horizontal cells by depolarizing steps applied to rods. Ryanodine caused a preferential reduction in the later portions of EPSCs evoked by depolarizing steps of 200 ms or longer. These results indicate that CICR enhances calcium increases in rod terminals evoked by sustained depolarization, which in turn acts to boost synaptic exocytosis from rods.",Excluded
3489,"Preclinical targeted alpha- and beta --radionuclide therapy in her2-positive brain metastasis using camelid single-domain antibodies HER2-targeted therapies have drastically improved the outcome for breast cancer patients. However, when metastasis to the brain is involved, current strategies fail to hold up to the same promise. Camelid single-domain antibody-fragments (sdAbs) have been demonstrated to possess favorable properties for detecting and treating cancerous lesions in vivo using different radiolabeling methods. Here we evaluate the anti-HER2 sdAb 2Rs15d, coupled to diagnostic gamma- and therapeutic alpha- and beta --emitting radionuclides for the detection and treatment of HER2pos brain lesions in a preclinical setting. 2Rs15d was radiolabeled with 111In, 225Ac and 131I using DTPA- and DOTA-based bifunctional chelators and Sn-precursor of SGMIB respectively and evaluated in orthotopic tumor-bearing athymic nude mice. Therapeutic efficacy as well as systemic toxicity were determined for 131I- and 225Ac-labeled sdAbs and compared to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab in two different HER2pos tumor models. Radiolabeled 2Rs15d showed high and specific tumor uptake in both HER2pos SK-OV-3-Luc-IP1 and HER2pos MDA-MB-231Br brain lesions, whereas radiolabeled trastuzumab was unable to accumulate in intracranial SK-OV-3-Luc-IP1 tumors. Administration of [131I]-2Rs15d and [225Ac]-2Rs15d alone and in combination with trastuzumab showed a significant increase in median survival in 2 tumor models that remained largely unresponsive to trastuzumab treatment alone. Histopathological analysis revealed no significant early toxicity. Radiolabeled sdAbs prove to be promising vehicles for molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy of metastatic lesions in the brain. These data demonstrate the potential of radiolabeled sdAbs as a valuable add-on treatment option for patients with difficult-to-treat HER2pos metastatic cancer. Copyright Â© 2020 by the authors.

3369,"First in Human Clinical Trial of a Metalloporphyrin Dual Radioprotectant and Radiosensitizer, BMX-001, in Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Glioma Undergoing Concurrent Chemoradiation Purpose/Objective(s): The metalloporphyrin, BMX-001 (MnTnBuOE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>), uniquely protects normal tissues from radiation damage and sensitizes tumor cells to radiation damage. We demonstrated this dual action in preclinical models where it protected white matter from radiation damage but augmented radiation-induced cell kill in human glioblastoma (GBM) xenografts. Therefore, we performed a phase 1 study to evaluate safety of BMX-001 in newly diagnosed patients with HGG receiving concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). Materials/Methods: This clinical trial was an IRB-approved, phase 1, single-center, dose-escalation study of BMX-001 in combination with concurrent RT (daily fractions of 1.8-2 Gy to a total of 59.4-60 Gy) and TMZ (75 mg/m2 daily X 42 days). We delivered BMX-001 via subcutaneous injection at a loading dose before the start of RT/TMZ and then 2 times/week for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and neurocognition. We defined progression-free survival and overall survival as survival from time of first BMX-001 injection until progression and death, respectively, and calculated both based on Kaplan-Meier analyses. Result(s): There were 15 evaluable subjects in the phase 1 study that received all planned BMX-001 doses. All 15 subjects had GBM (WHO grade IV) with age range of 19 to 80 years. BMX-001 at 28 mg loading dose and 14 mg subsequent dose was the MTD. Sinus tachycardia (grade 3) was the dose-limiting toxicity at 42 mg loading dose (n=1). The only other related grade >= 3 event was hypotension (grade 3, n=1). The most common related toxicity was grade 1 injection site reaction (n=7). Median follow-up time was 20.5 months (95% CI: 8.9, -). Progression-free survival was 7.1 months (95% CI: 3.9, 11.4). Overall survival was 23.4 months (95% CI: 11.2, 25.9) with seven GBM patients still alive at the time of this analysis. At time of this analysis, long-term results of neurocognition are pending. Conclusion(s): BMX-001 was safe to administer during concurrent chemoradiation in newly diagnosed HGG. Early results of survival analyses are promising, and long-term neurocognitive protection remains to be determined. Thus, we launched a multi-institutional Phase 2 study with BMX-001 in combination with concurrent chemoradiation in newly diagnosed HGG with key endpoints including overall survival and neurocognition and exploratory endpoints examining white matter integrity and health-related quality of life. Clinical trials are underway also for utilization of BMX-001 with radiation therapy for patients with head and neck cancer and brain metastases. Copyright Â© 2019",Excluded
528,"Evaluating the clinical effectiveness of 90Y-SMT 487 in patients with neuroendocrine tumors UNLABELLED: Because of the presence of cell membrane somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), many neuroendocrine tumors will bind analogs of somatostatin. (90)Y-Dodecanetetraacetic acid-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (SMT 487) is an SSTR radiopharmaceutical currently under investigation as a therapeutic option for neuroendocrine tumors. Although there are a variety of methods for evaluating response to a given cancer therapy, an important indicator of success is the impact on the clinical status of the patient. The purpose of this work was to develop a semiquantitative method and assess the clinical effectiveness of (90)Y-SMT 487 therapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors.METHODS: A scoring system was developed to evaluate clinical response that included the following parameters: weight, health status score (determined by the patient), Karnofsky score, and tumor-related symptoms.RESULTS: We applied this scoring system to 21 patients who had completed 3 cycles of therapy with (90)Y-SMT 487. Fourteen of the 21 showed a favorable clinical response, whereas 5 were clinically stable after treatment and 2 showed evidence of clinical progression. There was also a significant reduction in the amount of octreotide being used after completion of (90)Y-SMT 487 therapy in the 20 patients who were on this medication.CONCLUSION: Using this scoring method, (90)Y-SMT 487 appears effective in improving the clinical status of patients with (111)In-pentetreotide-positive neuroendocrine tumors.",Excluded

Ninety-one patients received PCI (30 Gy/15 or 25 Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy.RESULTS: Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0 months vs. 7.6 months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR = 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p = 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR = 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p = 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p = 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery.CONCLUSIONS: PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs.",Included
3317,"Long-Term Deficits in Behavior Performances Caused by Low- and High-Linear Energy Transfer Radiation Efforts to protect astronauts from harmful galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) require a better understanding of the effects of GCR on human health. In particular, little is known about the lasting effects of GCR on the central nervous system (CNS), which may lead to behavior performance deficits. Previous studies have shown that high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in rodents leads to short-term declines in a variety of behavior tests. However, the lasting impact of low-, medium- and high-LET radiation on behavior are not fully defined. Therefore, in this study C57BL/6 male mice were irradiated with 100 or 250 cGy of gamma rays (LET ~0.3 KeV/mum), 10 or 100 cGy of <sup>1</sup>H at 1,000 MeV/n (LET ~0.2 KeV/mum), <sup>28</sup>Si at 300 MeV/n (LET ~69 KeV/mum) or <sup>56</sup>Fe at 600 MeV/n (LET of ~180 KeV/mum), and behavior metrics were collected at 5 and 9 months postirradiation to analyze differences among radiation qualities and doses. A significant dose effect was observed on recognition memory and activity levels measured 9 months postirradiation, regardless of radiation source. In contrast, we observed that each ion species had a distinct effect on anxiety, motor coordination and spatial memory at extended time points. Although <sup>28</sup>Si and <sup>56</sup>Fe are both regarded as high-LET particles, they were shown to have different detrimental effects on behavior. In summary, our findings suggest that GCR not only affects the CNS in the short term, but also has lasting damaging effects on the CNS that can cause sustained declines in behavior performance.",Included

However, for extensive brain coverage, a large number of slices is required, resulting in long acquisition times (TAs). Recording multiple slices simultaneously (SMS) promises to reduce the TA. Methods A combination of zoomed and parallel imaging is used to achieve high isotropic resolution dMRI data with a low level of distortions at 7T. The blipped-CAIPI (controlled aliasing in parallel imaging) approach is used to acquire several slices simultaneously. Due to their high radiofrequency (RF) power deposition and ensuing specific absorption rate (SAR) constraints, the commonly used multiband (MB) RF pulses for SMS imaging are inefficient at 7T and entail long repetition times, counteracting the usefulness of SMS acquisitions. To address this issue, low SAR multislice Power Independent of Number of Slices RF pulses are employed. Results In vivo dMRI results with and without SMS acceleration are presented at different isotropic spatial resolutions at ultra high field strength. The datasets are recorded at a high angular resolution to detect fiber crossings. Conclusion From the results and compared with earlier studies at these resolutions, it can be seen that scan time is significantly reduced, while image quality is preserved.

In this study, 483 patients were undergoing LDRT for degenerative joint disease of the fingers and thumb at the University Hospital Erlangen between 2004 and 2019. Radiotherapy was applied according to the German guidelines for LDRT. Several impact factors on therapeutic success, such as the age and gender, the number of affected fingers, the single and cumulative dose, as well as the number of series, were investigated. In summary, 70% of the patients showed an improvement of their pain following LDRT. No significant impact was found for the factors age, gender, the number of series or the cumulative dosage. Patients with an involvement of the thumb showed a significantly worse outcome compared to patients with an isolated affection of the fingers. In this cohort, patients receiving a single dose of 0.5 Gy reported a significantly better outcome than patients receiving 1.0 Gy, strongly suggesting a reduction in the total dose.

570,"CBCT-guided Winston Lutz test Purpose/Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of the radiation isocenter of a linac when a Winston Lutz (WL) test is performed using the CBCT as a localization tool for the target. Material(s) and Method(s): A Varian 2100 CD linac equipped witha 120 MLC, aSi 500 EPID and OBI system (v 1.5). A phantom containing a central tungsten ball (5 mm diameter) mimicking a target is used. The phantom was CT scanned in a Siemens Somaton scanner (planning CT, pCT) and imported into the Eclipse TPS (v. 10.0). The tungsten ball was delineated and a no-coplanar plan (WL plan) was added with its isocenter located at the ball center. The WL plan consisted of 10 smallfields (6X) of 2x2 cm size collimated with the Millennium 120 MLC of the linac (G0T0,G140T315, G140T270, G180T0, G220T90, G220T45, G270T0, G270T45, G90T0 and G90T315,where G: gantry and T: table, scale: Varian IEC). The WL plan includes a CBCT field setup. The phantom was setup in the linac by aligning the ball center with the room lasers. After that, intended shifts within +/- 1 cm were applied alongside the three translational directions of the table, in order to simulate a setup error of the phantom. CBCT was acquired (Gantryrotation: 360degree, FOV: 45 cm, matrix: 512x512 and slice distance: 1 mm) and 3D/3D match was performed using the pCTas reference. The required couch movements to correct the actual position ofthe target were applied in a remote way. After that, the WL plan was delivered and an integrated MV image for each field was acquired using the EPID. EPID was positioned at 80 cm below the linac isocenter, giving a pixel size of 0.4 mm. The WL plan was irradiated twelve times during a year (118 shots/images). Each recorded MV image was analysed with ImageJ software in order to measure the distance (2D) between the ball center and the field center. Each 2D distance was decomposed into the three anatomical directions (Left/Right, Anterior/Posterior and Superior/Inferior). Result(s): The analysis of the 118 MV images collected reported the following differences (mean and 95% CI) between the ball center and the radiation center: 1) L/R : 0.6 mm [95% CI: 1.4 mm] 2) AP/PA : 0.5 mm [95% CI: 1.2 mm] 3) Sup/Inf: 0.7 mm [95% CI: 1.6 mm] Conclusion(s): The isocenter accuracy was within 2 mm on each direction, when the CBCT technique is used for target localization. The results found in this study included inaccuracies due to gantry and couch rotations, remote couch movements and potential misalignments between the linac and the OBI isocenters.

Out of this number 6,163 deaths were from ischemic heart disease, and 4,388 deaths were from cerebrovascular diseases. Analysis was performed on the basis of individualized estimates of dose accumulated in muscle tissue (both internal and external components of the dose), calculated with new Techa River Dosimetry System 2016. As per the latest calculations, mean dose to muscle tissue in members of the combined cohort was 34 mGy, maximum dose was 995 mGy. Simple parametric model of excess relative risk (ERR) was used in the analysis. The number of person-years at risk was 1836,203. The findings of the analysis show linear increase of mortality risk per unit dose from all the disease of circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy was 3%; 95% CI: 0,8%; 5,2%) and from ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy was 9,2%; 95% CI: 5,4%; 13,5%). with 15-year latent period. No statistically significant increase in mortality from the cerebrovascular diseases in the combined cohort of the population exposed in the Southern Urals over a 65-year period received evidence. The obtained results are in good agreement with those received in the analysis of the effect in the Techa River Cohort in 2013. The latter covered a 53-year period (with minimum latent period of 15 years) and revealed statistically significant linear dose response for all diseases of the circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy - 0.036) and ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy - 0.056).

861,"A radical approach to cancer Reactive oxygen species are known to be potentially dangerous, but are also needed for signal-transduction pathways. Tumor cells have relatively low amounts of superoxide dismutase (SOD), which quenches superoxide anion (O2(-*)), and as a result of a higher level of aerobic metabolism, higher concentrations of O2(-*) , compared to normal cells. But this may not be true of all tumor cells. Some tumor cells have relatively higher amounts of vitamin E, a potent anti-oxidant, and a higher level of anaerobic metabolism, resulting in a balance that is tilted more towards higher anti-oxidant capacity. In both instances of higher aerobic and anaerobic metabolism methods designed to augment free radical generation in tumor cells can cause their death. It is suggested that free radicals and lipid peroxides suppress the expression of Bcl-2, activate caspases and shorten telomere, and thus inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. Ionizing radiation, anthracyclines, bleomycin and cytokines produce free radicals and thus are useful as anti-cancer agents. But they also produce many side-effects. 2-methoxyoestradiol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit SODs and cause an increase of O2(-*) in tumor cells leading to their death. In addition, PUFAs (especially gamma-linolenic acid), 2-methoxyoestradiol and thalidomide may possess anti-angiogenic activity. This suggests that free radicals can suppress angiogenesis. Limited clinical studies done with gamma-linolenic acid showed that it can regress human brain gliomas without any significant side-effects. Thus, PUFAs, thalidomide and 2-methoxyoestradiol or their derivatives may offer a new radical approach to the treatment of cancer. [References: 173]",Excluded

Skeletal muscle mass was measured as total psoas area and total abdominal muscle area (TAMA) at 3 anatomical levels using the patient's preoperative computed tomography scan. Radiation attenuation was measured using corresponding mean Hounsfield units for TAMA. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as body mass index above 25 kg.m-2 combined with skeletal muscle mass index below the sex-specific median. Postoperative complications were graded by using the -Clavien-Dindo classification.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (25.3%) developed a grade 3-5 complication. Lower radiation attenuation was independently associated with overall (p = 0.003) and grade 3-5 complications (p = 0.002). Sarcopenic obesity was associated with overall complications (all p < 0.05). Skeletal muscle measurements and survival were not significantly related.CONCLUSION: Radiation attenuation was associated with overall and grade 3-5 postoperative morbidity after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and non-laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer.

1332,"The effect of age on the latency of radiation myelopathy The latent period to forelimb paresis following photon irradiation of the cervical spinal cord was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats ranging in age from 9 days to adulthood. The radiation was administered dorsally in single fractions, and in 15-day-old animals, to different lengths of the rostral cord and in doses ranging from 16 to 38 Gy. The duration of the latent period was found to be directly proportional to the age of the animal at the time of irradiation, and independent of radiation dose or the volume of the cervical cord which was irradiated. In the majority of paretic animals, the irradiated segment of the spinal cord demonstrated white matter necrosis. The results indicate that in the developing rat, the manifestations of radiation myelopathy are delayed by an interval determined in part by the age of the animal at the time of irradiation.",Included

This study was performed to investigate the effect of power frequency magnetic fields.METHOD: A total of 793 cases between 1987 and 1999 were identified through the Swedish cancer registry and 101,762 controls were randomly selected from the total population. Information about occupation was obtained from censuses and linked to gender specific job-exposure matrices based on actual measurements of 50 Hz magnetic field exposure.RESULT: We investigated time-weighted average, peak values, and rate of change of magnetic field exposure considering several different time windows in relation to cancer diagnosis. We found no increases in risks regardless of exposure metric or time window of exposure.CONCLUSION: This study is the largest ever on acoustic neuroma and the first study to evaluate this tumor subtype specifically in relation to extremely low frequency magnetic fields. The results do not support the hypothesis that 50 Hz magnetic fields increase the risk of acoustic neuroma.",Excluded
2388,"A calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance underlies the plateau potential in rat substantia nigra GABAergic neurons Plateau potentials can be elicited in nigral GABAergic neurons by injection of 500 ms depolarizing current pulses from hyperpolarized holding potentials in whole-cell recordings in vitro. In approximately one-third of these neurons, plateau potentials were observed under control conditions and could be elicited in the remaining neurons after blocking potassium conductances. Application of the L-type calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 or activation of NMDA receptors enhanced plateau potentials observed under control conditions and caused a plateau to be elicited in neurons not exhibiting it previously. The plateau potential was abolished in calcium-free buffer, as well as by nickel or cadmium. The L-type calcium channel blockers nimodipine and nifedipine abolished the plateau potential observed under control conditions but did not affect plateaus unmasked by tetraethylammonium. Plateau potentials observed under control conditions as well as those observed in the presence of Bay K 8644, NMDA, or tetraethylammonium were abolished in low-sodium buffer and by the calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance blocker flufenamic acid. These data suggest that nigral plateau potentials are mediated by a calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance (I(CAN)) that is activated by calcium entry predominantly through L-type calcium channels. In many nigral neurons, I(CAN) is masked by tetraethylammonium-sensitive potassium conductances, but plateaus can be evoked after increasing calcium conductances. The I(CAN)-mediated plateau potential in nigral GABAergic neurons likely affects the way these neurons integrate input and may represent a mechanism contributing to the rhythmic firing of these neurons seen in pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.",Excluded

Neck irradiation and radiotherapy-induced arteritis are common indications. The clinical outcomes of CAS for radiation arteritis have been poorly defined.METHODS: A prospective database of patients undergoing CAS at a tertiary referral academic medical center was maintained from 1999 to 2006. Patients undergoing primary carotid artery stenting for significant atherosclerotic (ASOD) and radiotherapy (XRT)-induced occlusive disease were analyzed. Life-table analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazard analysis or Fisher's exact test was performed to identify factors associated with outcomes. Data are presented as the mean +/- SEM unless otherwise indicated.RESULTS: During the study period, 150 patients underwent primary CAS, 75% with embolic protection. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. One hundred twenty-seven (85%) were treated for ASOD, and 23 (15%) had XRT. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1% for ASOD and 0% for XRT (P = NS); overall survival at 3 years was equivalent. There was no significant difference in major adverse event rates as defined by the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial between the groups. The 3-year neurologic event-free rate was 85% for ASOD and 87% for XRT (P = NS). Late asymptomatic occlusions were seen only in XRT patients. The 3-year freedom from restenosis rate was significantly worse for the XRT group, at 20%, vs 74% for the ASOD group (P < .05). Likewise, the 3-year patency rate was also worse for the XRT group, at 91%, vs 100% for ASOD by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < .05). No factor was predictive of occlusion or stenosis by Cox proportional hazards analysis.CONCLUSION: CAS for radiation arteritis has poor long-term anatomic outcome and can present with late asymptomatic occlusions. These findings suggest that these patients require closer postoperative surveillance and raise the question of whether CAS is appropriate for carotid occlusive lesions caused by radiation arteritis.",Included
1137,"Artificial Intelligence is implemented as a tool in the daily workflow on the PET/MRI scanner to create an attenuation map for the correct PET image Introduction: Artificial Intelligence is implemented as a tool in the daily workflow on the PET/MRI scanner to create an attenuation map for the correct PET image. Background(s): A PET/MRI Siemens Biograph mMRI was installed in 2011 and used in the daily routine primarily for dementia patients. The PET/MRI is challenged by lack of a direct measure of photon attenuation correction (AC), for obtaining a correct PET image. The patients previously needed to have a low-dose CT-AC. Ladefoged et al. developed an application based on deep learning model to generate artificial CT images from MR images. The model was trained on more than 1000 patients with both MRI and CT scans. The deep learning model takes images for attenuation correction in reconstructing positron emission tomography (PET/MRI). Since May 2019 Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based MRI-AC has been implemented as a part of the daily workflow. The objective of this study was to share our experiences of the use of AI MRI-AC in clinical practice. Method(s): All patients for dementia evaluation are injected with 200 MBq [18F] FDG, rest for 30 min and imaged with PET/MRI in a protocol consisting of a 10 min single-bed acquisition. The Dixon umap is centered on the brain stem and MRI sequences are focused on structural and vascular pathology. As soon as the Dixon sequence is ready it is sent to a computer node. The AI-method will generate and return a new AC map to be used during reconstruction for the correct attenuated PET image in less than 1 min. AI generated umaps are inspected before use by technologists and accuracy is followed weekly by comparing to a CT based reference. Result(s): Implementing AI in the daily routine for dementia patients on a PET/MRI scanner results in images that are ready to be viewed and described as soon as the patient leaves the scanner. The patients have no need for a CT scan, which saves the patients from extra radiation dose, and saves the staff some challenging time due to handling the immobile dementia patients. Conclusion(s): AI models, if validated for performance, offer several potential benefits to patients as well as technologists. One-stop PET/MRI for dementia patients is quick and together with the AI it is a robust and cost-effective technique for the health care system.",Excluded
2411,"Chronic administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, prevents fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive impairment We hypothesized that chronic administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, to young adult male rats would prevent/ameliorate fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive impairment. Eighty 12-14-week-old young adult male Fischer 344 rats received either: (1) sham irradiation, (2) 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation delivered as two 5 Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks, (3) sham irradiation plus continuous administration of 15 mg/L of ramipril in the drinking water starting 3 days before irradiation, or (4) fractionated whole-brain irradiation plus ramipril. Cognitive function was assessed using a perirhinal cortex-dependent version of the novel object recognition task 26 weeks after irradiation. Microglial activation was determined in the perirhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus 28 weeks after irradiation using the ED1 antibody. Neurogenesis was assessed in the granular cell layer and subgranular zones of the dentate gyrus using a doublecortin antibody. Fractionated whole-brain irradiation led to: (1) a significant impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, (2) a significant increase in activated microglia in the dentate gyrus but not in the perirhinal cortex, and (3) a significant decrease in neurogenesis. Continuous administration of ramipril before, during, and after irradiation prevented the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced changes in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, as well as in microglial activation in the dentate gyrus. Thus, as hypothesized, continuous administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, can prevent the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function.",Included
612,"Evaluation of Peritumoral Edema in the Delineation of Radiotherapy Clinical Target Volumes for Glioblastoma Purpose: To evaluate the spatial relationship between peritumoral edema and recurrence pattern in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods and Materials: Forty-eight primary GBM patients received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy that did not intentionally include peritumoral edema within the clinical target volume between July 2000 and June 2001. All 48 patients have subsequently recurred, and their original treatment planning parameters were used for this study. New theoretical radiation treatment plans were created for the same 48 patients, based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) target delineation guidelines that specify inclusion of peritumoral edema. Target volume and recurrent tumor coverage, as well as percent volume of normal brain irradiated, were assessed for both methods of target delineation using dose-volume histograms. Result(s): A comparison between the location of recurrent tumor and peritumoral edema volumes from all 48 cases failed to show correlation by linear regression modeling (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.0007; p = 0.3). For patients with edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, the percent volume of brain irradiated to 46 Gy was significantly greater in treatment plans that intentionally included peritumoral edema compared with those that did not (38% vs. 31%; p = 0.003). The pattern of failure was identical between the two sets of plans (40 central, 3 in-field, 3 marginal, and 2 distant recurrence). Conclusion(s): Clinical target volume delineation based on a 2-cm margin rather than on peritumoral edema did not seem to alter the central pattern of failure for patients with GBM. For patients with peritumoral edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, using a constant 2-cm margin resulted in a smaller median percent volume of brain being irradiated to 30 Gy, 46 Gy, and 50 Gy compared with corresponding theoretical RTOG plans that deliberately included peritumoral edema.

3111,"Optimal timing and clinical value of radiotherapy in advanced ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer with or without baseline brain metastases: implications from pattern of failure analyses BACKGROUND: Despite development of several next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib remains one of the first-line treatment options for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and is widely used in situations where next-generation TKIs aren't yet approved or economically inaccessible. However, the pattern of failure and clinical value of radiotherapy in metastatic crizotinib-treated ALK-mutant lung cancer, with or without baseline brain metastases (BBM), are largely unknown.METHODS: Consecutive crizotinib-treated NSCLC patients with adequate imaging and measurable disease were retrospectively enrolled. Disease progression in original sites (primary/metastatic), new sites, or both, are classified as original failure (OF), distant failure (DF) and ODF, respectively. Progression free survival, from crizotinib initiation to the first disease progression, and from that to the second disease progression, were calculated as PFS1 and PFS2.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified. With a median follow up of 22.0 (range, 2.0-72.0) months, 52 patients had crizotinib-treatment failure. The frequencies of OF, ODF, and DF, were 50.0, 26.9, and 23.1%, respectively. Histology, primary tumor size and presence of BBM, were independently associated with OF, using competing risks analyses. The brain was the most common site of initial disease progression. Patients with BBM had a significant higher possibility developing multiple-progressive lesions in the brain (p = 0.002). Importantly, four of the ten patients who had baseline oligo-metastatic cranial disease but didn't receive upfront brain radiation, developed multiple-progressive disease in the brain. Brain radiation before crizotinib could alter the disease failure patterns and improve PFS1 among patients with BBM (p = 0.006). Extracranial radiation was efficient in controlling symptoms but it was not associated with PFS1 (p = 0.223), and the majority of patients were eligible for salvage radiotherapy upon disease progression to crizotinib. By the time of data cut-off, 28 patients had second disease progression, with a median PFS2 of 7.0 (95% CI 5.4-8.6) months and salvage radiotherapy significantly prolonged PFS2 (p = 0.003). Additionally, patients receiving any radiotherapy during their treatment course had a significant longer overall survival (p = 0.048).CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with baseline oligo-metastatic brain lesions which are suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery, upfront brain radiotherapy provides considerable clinical benefits. While, extracranial radiation may be deferred in asymptomatic patients with multiple-metastatic lesions.",Excluded
312,"Synapses in the fly motion-vision pathway: evidence for a broad range of signal amplitudes and dynamics Synapses are generally considered to operate efficiently only when their signaling range matches the spectrum of prevailing presynaptic signals in terms of both amplitudes and dynamics. However, the prerequisites for optimally matching the signaling ranges may differ between spike-mediated and graded synaptic transmission. This poses a problem for synapses that convey both graded and spike signals at the same time. We addressed this issue by tracing transmission systematically in vivo in the blowfly's visual-motion pathway by recording from single neurons that receive mixed potential signals consisting of rather slow graded fluctuations superimposed with highly variable spikes from a small number of presynaptic elements. Both pre- and postsynaptic neurons were previously shown to represent preferred-direction motion velocity reliably and linearly at low fluctuation frequencies. To selectively assess the performance of individual synapses and to precisely control presynaptic signals, we voltage clamped one of the presynaptic neurons. Results showed that synapses can effectively convey signals over a much larger amplitude and frequency range than is normally used during graded transmission of visual signals. An explanation for this unexpected finding might lie in the transmission of the spike component that reaches larger amplitudes and contains higher frequencies than graded signals.",Excluded

Total background ionizing radiation was also significantly correlated with AD death rate in 50 states and the District of Columbia (r = 0.452, p = 0.001). Multivariate linear regression weighted by state population demonstrated that AD death rate was significantly correlated with radon background (beta= 0.169, p < 0.001), age (beta= 0.231, p < 0.001), hypertension (beta= 0.155, p < 0.001), and diabetes (beta= 0.353, p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Our findings, like other studies, suggest that ionizing radiation is a risk factor for AD. Intranasal inhalation of radon gas could subject the rhinencephalon and hippocampus to damaging radiation that initiates AD.

Methods A PINS-TSE sequence was implemented and combined with blipped CAIPI to improve the reconstruction of superposed slices. Whole brain imaging of healthy volunteers was performed at both 3T and 7T using a 32-channel coil for signal reception. Results A considerable reduction in power deposition was achieved compared with a standard sequence of the manufacturer. At 3T, the reduction in specific absorption rate (SAR) made short pulse repetition times (TRs) possible, however, in order to obtain a good T2 contrast, it is advisable to maintain TR while extending the echo train length. At 7T, whole brain coverage with a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 x 2 mm<sup>3</sup> was achieved in an acquisition time of 150 s. Furthermore, it could be shown that pulse sequences that use PINS pulses do not suffer from having additional magnetization transfer contrast. Conclusion PINS RF pulses combined with multiband imaging reduce SAR sufficiently to enable routine TSE imaging at 7T within clinically acceptable acquisition times. In general, the combination of multiband imaging with PINS RF pulses represents a method to reduce total RF power deposition. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
3075,"The role of mislocalized phototransduction in photoreceptor cell death of retinitis pigmentosa Most of inherited retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) cause photoreceptor cell death resulting in blindness. RP is a large family of diseases in which the photoreceptor cell death can be caused by a number of pathways. Among them, light exposure has been reported to induce photoreceptor cell death. However, the detailed mechanism by which photoreceptor cell death is caused by light exposure is unclear. In this study, we have shown that even a mild light exposure can induce ectopic phototransduction and result in the acceleration of rod photoreceptor cell death in some vertebrate models. In ovl, a zebrafish model of outer segment deficiency, photoreceptor cell death is associated with light exposure. The ovl larvae show ectopic accumulation of rhodopsin and knockdown of ectopic rhodopsin and transducin rescue rod photoreceptor cell death. However, knockdown of phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that mediates the next step of phototransduction, does not. So, ectopic phototransduction activated by light exposure, which leads to rod photoreceptor cell death, is through the action of transducin. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that forced activation of adenylyl cyclase in the inner segment leads to rod photoreceptor cell death. For further confirmation, we have also generated a transgenic fish which possesses a human rhodopsin mutation, Q344X. This fish and rd10 model mice show photoreceptor cell death caused by adenylyl cyclase. In short, our study indicates that in some RP, adenylyl cyclase is involved in photoreceptor cell death pathway; its inhibition is potentially a logical approach for a novel RP therapy.",Excluded

1149,"What does an epileptiform spike look like in MEG? Comparison between coincident EEG and MEG spikes Recent investigations suggest that there are differences between the characteristics of EEG and MEG epileptiform spikes. The authors performed an objective characterization of the morphology of epileptiform spikes recorded simultaneously in both EEG and MEG to determine whether they present the same morphologic characteristics. Based on a stepwise approach, the authors performed a computer analysis of EEG and MEG of a set of coincident epileptiform transients selected by a senior clinical neurophysiologist in recordings of three patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A computer-based algorithm was applied to extract parameters that could be used to describe quantitatively the morphology of the transients, followed by a statistical comparison over the extracted metrics of the EEG and MEG waveforms. EEG and MEG coincident events were statistically different with respect to several morphologic characteristics, such as duration, sharpness, and shape. The differences found appear to be a consequence of MEG signals not being influenced by volume propagation through the tissues with different conductivities that surround the brain, compared with EEG, and of the different orientation of the underlying dipolar sources. The results indicate that visual inspection of MEG spikes and automatic spike-detector algorithms should use criteria adapted to the specific characteristics of the MEG, and not simply those used on conventional EEG.",Excluded
648,"Characterization of structurally distinct, isoform-selective phosphoinositide 3'-kinase inhibitors in combination with radiation in the treatment of glioblastoma The phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling pathway plays a key role in fundamental cellular functions important in normal cellular homeostasis and malignant transformation. Deregulated signaling through this pathway contributes to development of gliomas and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway has thus emerged as a promising approach to successful treatment of gliomas. We assessed the radiosensitizing potential of four small-molecule inhibitors that differ in their activities against specific isoforms of the PI3K 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). p110alpha inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of both protein kinase B/Akt and S6 in all cell lines examined, effectively decreased cellular proliferation, and produced additive cytotoxic effects in combination with radiation therapy. The p110beta inhibitor exhibited limited biochemical effects and failed to decrease cellular proliferation or viability as either a single agent or in combination with radiation or rapamycin. In vivo studies examining the effects of the p110alpha inhibitor in combination with radiation indicated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate induced by the combined treatment compared with each treatment modality alone. This translated into a trend toward prolonged time-to-failure for mice in the combination treatment group. In conclusion, PI3K inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of glioblastomas, especially when used in combination with ionizing radiation.",Excluded

Immediately after TBI and prior to hMSC or control treatment, rats were subjected to either targeted precision x-ray irradiation to eliminate subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation or sham irradiation. One week after TBI, SVZ irradiation, and hMSC treatment, rats were evaluated for the depression-like behavior, anhedonia, using the two-bottle saccharin preference paradigm; and for working memory using the novel object recognition test.RESULTS: TBI resulted in a 54% (p<=0.05) decrease in saccharin preference scores while treatment of TBI with hMSC fully prevented this anhedonic behavior. TBI was also found to produce a 73% (p<=0.05) decrease in novel object interaction time, indicating impaired working memory, and was similarly improved by treatment with hMSC. The ability of hMSC to prevent TBI-associated depression and working memory impairment was eliminated when SVZ proliferation was inhibited by irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This work has identified a possible role for hMSC in the treatment of TBI-induced depression and other behaviors and suggests a mechanistic role for proliferative cells of the SVZ proliferation in hMSC efficacy.",Excluded
2016,"Novel snapshot imaging of photoreceptor bleaching in macaque and human retinas PURPOSE: Various methods have been used to obtain a topographic map of bleached photopigments in human retinas in the past. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the bleaching topography of the photoreceptors could be obtained by snapshot imaging reflectometry.METHODS: Four to five fundus photographs of one rhesus monkey and three healthy human subjects were taken by white flashes at intervals of 4 s, with a commercial fundus camera with minimal modifications. The flash-induced reflectance increases (bleaching) were calculated by dividing the reflectance of the first image into the subsequent images, pixel by pixel.RESULTS: The topography of the bleached macula corresponded well with the anatomical distribution of the cones. The ratio of reflectance changes in the center to that in the surrounding tissue was high for red and low for green and blue images. These results indicate that the reflectivity changes were not artifacts but were derived from changes in the photopigment density in the cones and rods.CONCLUSIONS: The topography of bleached photoreceptors obtained with a commercial fundus camera from one monkey and three healthy human subjects showed that this technique has potential as a new clinical method for examining photoreceptor function in both normal and diseased retinas.",Excluded
1491,"Changes in the vestibular function during space flight An analysis of observations and investigations carried out in space flight has shown that some cosmonauts and astronauts have experienced vestibular disorders during the transition to weightlessness. Vestibular-sensory disorders include: Spatial illusions (the feelings of falling down, being in an upside-down position, the sensations of rotation of the craft or the body) and vertigo occurring during the onset of the orbital flight and head movements; Feelings, similar to those experienced in response to Coriolis accelerations on the Earth, which occasionally develop in weightlessness during the spacecraft rotation upon abrupt head and body movements and restrained feet; Feelings ""of the load on the vestibular analyser which is unlike any Earth-bound effects"" upon abrupt head movements during the first hours of an orbital flight and ""a prolonged movement"" during the switch-off of thrusters in weightlessness. Vestibular-vegetative disorders comprise a complex of symptoms similar to those of motion sickness: loss of appetite, stomach awareness (12%), hypersalination, nausea (9.6%) and vomiting (4.8%). Soviet studies suggest that the vestibular tolerance to the flight effects depends on the natural stability and training to the cumulative effect of adequate vestibular stimuli. This has been used in the development of the system of vestibular selection. Changes in the vestibular function seem to play the major role in the development of motion sickness in weightlessness, extra-labyrinthine factors being contributory. The current hypotheses have not yet been adequately confirmed in experiments. A detailed physiological analysis allows the conclusion that the decisive factor in the development of motion sickness may be the disturbance of the function of analysers responsible for spatial orientation which take the form of sensory conflicts as well as an altered reactivity of the organism due to the hemodynamic rearrangement.

969,"Endovascular treatment of cerebrovascular disease Purpose of review: This review summarizes recent advances in endovascular therapy for cerebrovascular disease. Recent findings: For ruptured aneurysms, the only large, randomized, controlled trial comparing surgical and endovascular treatment (the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial) resulted in a significant reduction in death or dependency at 1 year, compared with surgery, providing sound evidence that coiling should be the treatment of first choice. Data from the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms demonstrated that treatment of unruptured anterior circulation aneurysms of under 7 mm with no history of subarachnoid hemorrhage is not justified. Embolization of arteriovenous malformations, as sole therapy, is curative only in a small percentage of cases, but can be part of a multimodal approach for reducing arteriovenous malformation size prior to surgery or radiotherapy. Partial treatment of complex arteriovenous malformations may be more dangerous than no treatment. Protection devices can reduce complication rates in carotid artery stenting, but scientific evidence is still lacking. Until the results of comparative trials are available, carotid artery stenting is indicated only in selected patients. Angioplasty and stenting of intracranial arterosclerotic disease is feasible but remains a high-risk procedure, indicated only in highly selected patients. In acute stroke therapy, new thrombolytics and clot-retrieval devices may result in better recanalization rates. Summary: Advances in endovascular therapy have occurred in all areas of cerebrovascular disease. To obtain maximal patient benefit, endovascular treatment should be performed as an interdisciplinary approach in high-volume centers. Importantly, long-term follow-up review is necessary to clarify the overall role of endovascular treatment in the management of cerebrovascular disease.

2733,"Neurochemical effects of photobiostimulation in the trigeminal ganglion after inferior alveolar nerve injury Orofacial pain is associated with peripheral and central sensitization of trigeminal nociceptive neurons. Nerve injury results in release of chemical mediators that contribute to persistent pain conditions. The activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), promotes release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) from trigeminal nerve terminals. CGRP and SP contribute to the development of peripheral hyperalgesia. The expression of SP and CGRP by primary afferent neurons is rapidly increased in response to peripheral inflammation. CGRP receptor activation promotes activation of AMPA receptors, leading to increased firing of neurons which is reflected as central sensitization. In this study we investigated whether inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) injury influences AMPA receptors, CGRP, SP and TRPV1 expression in the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The relative expression of the protein of interest from naive rats was compared to those from injured rats and animals that received low level laser therapy (LLLT). IAN-injury did not change expression of GluA1, GluA2 and CGRP, but increased the expression of TRPV1 and SP. LLLT increases GluA1 and GluA2 expression and decreases TVPV1, SP and CGRP. These results, together with previous behavioral data, suggest that IAN-injury induced changes in the proteins analyzed, which could impact on nociceptive threshold. These data may help to understand the molecular mechanisms of pain sensitization in the TG.",Excluded

This addendum article will focus on our recent development of the ""NSGW"" mouse, which, among other beneficial traits, is genetically modified to obviate the need for myeloablative irradiation of the animals. Thus, the complicating haematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and neurological side effects associated with irradiation are avoided and investigators without access to radiation sources are enabled to pursue engraftment studies with human HSCs. We will also discuss the topics of transgenics, knock-ins, and other mutants with an overarching goal of enhancing chimerism in these animal models.",Excluded
2391,"Clinical and histopathologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) after stereotactic radiosurgery OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma entails uncertain long-term risk of tumor recurrence and delayed cranial neuropathies. In addition, the underlying histopathologic changes to the tumor bed are not fully characterized. We seek to understand the clinical and histologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma after stereotactic radiation therapy.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Four patients who underwent microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannoma after primary stereotactic radiation therapy.INTERVENTION: Patients were treated primarily with gamma knife radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy followed by salvage microsurgery. Retrosigmoid craniotomy was used in all cases.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histopathologic review. Preoperative and postoperative facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann scale.RESULTS: We observed highly inconsistent radiation changes in the cerebellopontine angle and internal auditory canal. Fibrosis outside and within the tumor bed varied markedly, complicating microsurgical dissection. Light microscopy confirmed the presence of viable tumor in all cases. Histopathologic features were typical of vestibular schwannoma, and there was no significant scarring that could be attributed to radiation effect.CONCLUSIONS: The variable fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle and lack of radiation changes seen histopathologically in irradiated vestibular schwannoma suggest that a uniform treatment effect was not achieved in these cases. Although all four patients with preoperative cranial neuropathies were found intraoperatively to have fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle, excellent preservation of facial nerve anatomy and function was possible with salvage microsurgical resection. Additional analyses are needed to clarify the histopathologic and molecular characteristics associated with vestibular schwannoma growth after stereotactic radiation. [References: 58]",Excluded

945,"Copper-induced conformational changes in the N-terminal domain of the Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase The Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase plays a critical role in the intracellular trafficking of copper. Mutations in this protein lead to the accumulation of a toxic level of copper in the liver, kidney, and brain followed by extensive tissue damage and death. The ATPase has a novel amino-terminal domain ( approximately 70 kDa) which contains six repeats of the copper binding motif GMTCXXC. We have expressed and characterized this domain with respect to the copper binding sites and the conformational consequences of copper binding. A detailed analysis of this domain by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has revealed that each binding site ligates copper in the +1 oxidation state using two cysteine side chains with distorted linear geometry. Analysis of copper-induced conformational changes in the amino-terminal domain indicates that both secondary and tertiary structure changes take place upon copper binding. These copper-induced conformational changes could play an important role in the function and regulation of the ATPase in vivo. In addition to providing important insights on copper binding to the protein, these results suggest a possible mechanism of copper trafficking by the Wilson disease ATPase.",Excluded
1413,"Short-arm human centrifugation with 0.4g at eye and 0.75g at heart level provides similar cerebrovascular and cardiovascular responses to standing BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Orthostatic intolerance continues to be a problem with astronauts upon return to Earth as a result of cerebral and cardiovascular adaptations to weightlessness. We tested the hypothesis that artificial gravity from a short-arm human centrifuge (SAHC) could provide cerebral and cardiovascular stimuli similar to upright posture and thereby serve as a suitable countermeasure.METHODS: We compared cardiovascular and cerebrovascular responses before, during, and after exposure to hyper-G with that of standing in healthy young participants. The head was positioned such that the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was 0.46 m from the center of rotation. Two levels of hyper-G that provided 1g and 2g at foot level were investigated. Continuous blood pressure, heart rate, calf blood volume, MCA mean blood flow velocity (MFV) and end-tidal CO2 were measured.RESULTS: Blood pressure at the level of the MCA (BP-MCA) and MFV was reduced during stand and at 2g. The relationship between MFV and BP-MCA at 2g was different from supine and similar to standing, while 1g centrifugation was not different from supine. The cardiovascular system was also not different from supine at 1g but was similarly challenged in 2g compared to stand.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that short-arm centrifugation 2g at the feet, with the head offset 0.5 m from the center, provides similar cardiovascular and cerebral responses to standing. This supports the hypothesis that passive 2g SAHC exposure at the feet could be used as a countermeasure for in-flight cardiovascular and cerebrovascular deconditioning.",Excluded
216,"Multiwavelength optical intrinsic signal imaging of cortical spreading depression Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is an important disease model for migraine and cerebral ischemia. In this study, we exploit the high temporal and spatial resolution of optical imaging to characterize perfusion-dependent and -independent changes in response to CSD and to investigate the etiology of reflectance changes during CSD. In this experiment, we characterized the optical response to CSD at wavelengths that emphasize perfusion-related changes (610 and 550 nm), and we compared these results with 850 nm and blood volume data. Blood volume changes during CSD were recorded using an intravascular fluorescent dye, Texas Red dextran. We observed triphasic optical signals at 850 and 550 nm characterized by spreading waves of increased, decreased, then increased reflectance (Fig. 1) which expanded at a rate of approximately 3-5 mm/min. The signal at 610 nm had a similar initial phase, but the phase 2 response was slightly more complex, with a parenchymal decrease in reflectance but a vascular increase in reflectance. Reflectance values decreased in phase three. Blood volume signals were delayed relative to the optical intrinsic signals and corresponded temporally to phases 2 and 3. This is the first study to characterize optical imaging of intrinsic signal responses to CSD, in vivo, at multiple wavelengths. The data presented here suggest that changes in light scattering precede perfusion responses, the blood volume increase (phase 2) is accompanied by a reduction in deoxyhemoglobin, and the blood volume decrease (phase 3) is accompanied by an increase in deoxyhemoglobin. Previous studies have suggested the oligemia of spreading depression was a result of decreased metabolic demand. This study suggests that during the oligemic period there is a greater reduction in oxygen delivery than in demand.",Excluded

Sixteen patients with squamous carcinoma of the cervix were prospectively treated in a Phase I study. All tumors were stages IIb, IIIb, or IVa with diameters of > or = 7 cm. Patients underwent surgical staging with pelvic and paraortic lymphadenectomy with placement of bilateral intra-arterial catheters in the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries. The catheters terminated in separate subcutaneous ports. No patient had metastasis in the high common iliac or paraortic nodes. Patients received a planned course of 40-50 Gy whole pelvis XRT followed by indicated brachytherapy. During the first 2 weeks of whole pelvis XRT, patients received a 1-hr infusion of FUDR and during the second 2 weeks a 1-hr infusion of cisplatin, each delivered daily by external pump with the daily whole pelviS XRT fraction. Additional cisplatin was infused during brachytherapy. Five dose levels ranging from 6.5 to 27 mg/m2 daily for FUDR and from 2 to 8 mg/m2 daily for cisplatin were used. The MTD of FUDR and CDDP was dose level 4 (22.5 and 6.75 mg/m2, respectively). Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3/4 nausea seen in three of four patients at dose level 5. No patient had neuro- or ototoxicity. There was no grade 4 myelosuppression. Eight patients had a complete response, and six had a partial response. Disease progressed in two.

TBI was well tolerated and was associated with objective clinical improvement in six patients, lasting more than 2 years in five. In addition, TBI produced a long-lasting lymphopenia with a pronounced decrease of T CD4+ lymphocytes; T CD8+ lymphocytes were almost unchanged over the 2 years of the study. CD16+ and CD20+ lymphocytes, after an initial decrease, increased above baseline. TBI was also associated with decreased anti-AChR antibody titer. The decrease of lymphocyte count and of anti-AChR antibody titer was more pronounced in the patients who improved, suggesting that lymphopenia and immunosuppression may have contributed to clinical improvement.",Excluded

However, the unchecked systemic inflammatory response may result in cardiovascular immune-related adverse events, as myocarditis, pericardial disease, stress-induced, and dilated cardiomyopathy are increasingly reported in case series and pharmacovigilance databases. We sought to further investigate ICI-related cardiotoxicity in a cohort of patients with lung cancer. Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary lung cancer treated with ICIs or non-ICI systemic therapy over three years to assess the likelihood of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Data was collected on co-morbidities, cardiovascular medications, past or concurrent radiation or systemic therapies, serum troponin, brain natriuretic peptide levels, pre- and post-treatment electrocardiograms, echocardiography, angiography, and total ICI dose. Each factor was compared between patients treated with ICIs and non-ICI systemic therapy. Result(s): We included 252 patients in our study. During a median follow-up of 6 months (interquartile range: 2-14 months), patients treated with ICIs (n = 135) who had a troponin elevation were more likely to sustain a MACE (hazard ratio: 6.9, 95% confidence interval: 3.2-15, p <0.001) with a median time to event of 33 days (Figure 1). Discussion(s): Patients with lung cancer on ICIs are more likely to incur a troponin elevation compared to patients on conventional chemotherapy. Elevated troponin is associated with an increased likelihood of MACE, especially early during treatment with ICIs. This data supports closer monitoring, including serial troponin measurements during the early phase of ICI therapy. Copyright Â© 2019",Excluded

2910,"A study on an evaluation of brain scanning in cerebrovascular diseases. [Japanese] One hundred twenty cases of cerebrovascular diseases mainly of ischemic nature were studied. Positive brain scans were found in ischemic cerebral infarction in 68% of the cases; with a relatively low rate in the early phase from the onset of the illness showing a peak of positive scans in 2 to 4 wk with a gradual decline. Even those with a positive scan turned negative after 8 wk. A definite correlation between the clinical severity and positive scan was found. In cases with cortical involvement positive brain scan was observed in high frequency. Single brain scan yielded only a value of screening procedure but follow-up examinations in the course of illness proved to be rather important for the differential diagnosis of underlying pathology and further for fortelling the prognosis. In view of the prognosis of motor functions those with an intense uptake of radioisotope, a relatively large sized and persistent abnormality were likely left with severe neurological deficit while in cases who showed a mild and transient positive scan the recovery of motor functions were favorable. When rate of positive scan for the respective territory of cerebral vessels were evaluated, positive scans were most frequently observed in the vicinity of middle cerebral artery. The frequency of positive scans in the territory of posterior cerebral artery and vertebro-basilar artery were found lowest. Brain scanning was found most suitable for the diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, subdural hematoma and SLE vasculitis but it exhibited merely low rate of posivity in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage and transient ischemic attack.

2514,"Brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis predicts response in cancer patients with brain metastases Lymphocytopenia is one of the main toxicities of radiotherapy and its severity is related to the irradiation dose. The occurrence of lymphocytopenia depends on the body site of radiotherapy; it is most pronounced with pelvic irradiation, whereas the effect of brain irradiation on the lymphocyte count is to be elucidated. This preliminary study was performed to evaluate changes in lymphocyte number occurring during brain irradiation in cancer patients with brain metastases. The study included 50 patients who received brain radiotherapy for single or multiple brain metastases at a total dose of 30 Gy. Overall, no significant changes in mean lymphocyte number occurred during brain radiotherapy. However, when lymphocyte variations were assessed in relation to the clinical response of brain metastases, a significant increase in the mean number of lymphocytes was found in patients who achieved objective regression of brain metastases on brain irradiation. The mean lymphocyte number decreased in nonresponding patients, albeit without a statistically significant difference with respect to the pretreatment values. The results of this study show that the efficacy of radiotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is associated with a significant increase in mean lymphocyte number. Therefore, evidence of brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis may predict the efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded

Although the safety of CT-guided ESIs has been extensively studied in adults, there is limited data concerning the procedure's safety profile in an older patient population.OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study analyzed safety data among a single-center cohort of patients > 65 years-old who received one or more CT-guided interlaminar ESIs from 2012 to 2015.STUDY DESIGN: An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved retrospective chart review.SETTING: University hospital center.METHODS: A total of 688 CT-guided ESI procedures were evaluated and a linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between dose length product (DLP), body mass index (BMI), procedure duration, and kVp/mA settings. Further analysis was performed on a sample of long procedure time, average-DLP and high-DLP procedures.RESULTS: Average age was 75.77 years, with 44% having a BMI > 30. The mean DLP was 55.58 mGy x cm and the mean procedure duration was 5.94 minutes. All procedures were technically successful and no complications were observed during or after any of the procedures, including at one-month follow-up office visits. The kVp and mA settings were the strongest predictors of DLP, followed by procedure time. The high-DLP cases had a greater number of needle placement series, more intervertebral disc spaces included in each planning series and higher machine settings (kVp 120; mA 87.5) than the average-DLP cases (kVp 100; mA 49.9).LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by its retrospective design.CONCLUSION: CT-guided interlaminar ESIs can be performed safely, with low procedure times, relatively low DLP's and without complications in an older patient population.

450,"Local delivery of angiogenesis-inhibitor minocycline combined with radiotherapy and oral temozolomide chemotherapy in 9L glioma: Laboratory investigation Object. Over the past several years, there has been increasing interest in combining angiogenesis inhibitors with radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. Although the US FDA approved bevacizumab for the treatment of glioblastoma in 2009, the European Medicines Agency rejected its use due to its questionable impact on patient survival. One factor contributing to the failure of angiogenesis inhibitors to increase overall patient survival may be their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Here the authors examined in a 9L glioma model whether intracranial polymer-based delivery of the angiogenesis inhibitor minocycline potentiates the effects of both radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy in increasing median survival. The authors also investigated whether the relative timing of minocycline polymer implantation with respect to radiotherapy affects the efficacy of radiotherapy. Methods. Minocycline was incorporated into the biodegradable polymer polyanhydride poly(1,3-bis-[p-carboxyphenoxy propane]-co-[sebacic anhydride]) (CPP:SA) at a ratio of 50:50 by weight. Female Fischer 344 rats were implanted with 9L glioma on Day 0. The minocycline polymer was then implanted on either Day 3 or Day 5 posttumor implantation. Cohorts of rats were exposed to 20 Gy focal radiation on Day 5 or were administered oral temozolomide (50 mg/kg daily) on Days 5-9. Results. Both minocycline polymer implantations on Days 3 and 5 increased survival from 14 days to 19 days (p < 0.001 vs control). Treatment with a combination of both minocycline polymer and radiotherapy on Day 5 resulted in a 139% increase in median survival compared with treatment with radiotherapy alone (p < 0.005). There was not a statistically significant difference in median survival between the group that received minocycline implanted on the same day as radiotherapy and the group that received minocycline polymer 2 days prior to radiotherapy. Lastly, treatment with a combination of minocycline polymer with oral temozolomide resulted in a 38% extension of median survival compared with treatment of oral temozolomide alone (p < 0.001). Conclusions. These results show that minocycline delivered locally potentiates the effects of both radiotherapy and oral temozolomide in increasing median survival in a rodent glioma model. More generally, these results suggest that traditional therapy in combination with local, as opposed to systemic, delivery of angiogenesis inhibitors may be able to increase median survival for patients with glioblastoma.

This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of intracoronary radiation therapy (ICRT) after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for preventing restenosis in human coronary arteries.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22 arteries) with unstable angina underwent standard balloon angioplasty. ICRT was performed with the use of an 192Ir source wire that was hand delivered to the angioplasty site. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 24 hours, between 30 and 60 days, and at 6 months. Angioplasty was successful in 19 of 22 lesions, and insertion of the radioactive source wire was successful at all treated sites. Angiographic study at 24 hours demonstrated early late loss of the luminal diameter from 1.92+/-0.55 to 1.40+/-0.27 mm. Between 30 and 60 days, repeat angiography demonstrated total occlusion in 2 arteries, a new pseudoaneurysm in 1 artery, and significant dilatation at the treatment site in 2 additional vessels. At > or = 6 months' follow-up, all remaining arteries (n=20) maintained patent, with a mean lumen diameter of 1.65+/-0.8 mm.

3540,"Mechanisms of disease: DNA repair defects and neurological disease In this Review, familial and sporadic neurological disorders reported to have an etiological link with DNA repair defects are discussed, with special emphasis placed on the molecular link between the disease phenotype and the precise DNA repair defect. Of the 15 neurological disorders listed, some of which have symptoms of progeria, six - spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - seem to result from increased oxidative stress, and the inability of the base excision repair pathway to handle the damage to DNA that this induces. Five of the conditions (xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, Down syndrome, and triple-A syndrome) display a defect in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, four (Huntington's disease, various spinocerebellar ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia and myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2) exhibit an unusual expansion of repeat sequences in DNA, and four (ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Alzheimer's disease) exhibit defects in genes involved in repairing double-strand breaks.

2069,"Cost-Effectiveness of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Versus MRI Surveillance for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Purpose: Owing to conflicting prospective data, controversy exists regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PCI versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance for patients with ES-SCLC based on currently available evidence and in the context of the proposed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services alternative payment model. Methods and Materials: A Markov state transition model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing MRI surveillance alone with PCI for ES-SCLC. Clinical parameters were obtained from clinical trial data, and cost data were based on 2019 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and evaluated with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to consider model uncertainty. Result(s): In the base-case scenario, PCI was not cost-effective in this model, with an ICER of $168,456 per QALY gained compared with MRI surveillance alone, assuming that overall survival was 10 months for MRI surveillance alone and 12.5 months for PCI. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to the variation of overall survival and cognitive decline rates between the 2 groups. In a scenario analysis in which all patients received hippocampal-avoidance PCI, the model results became nearly cost-effective with PCI.

2460,"Near infrared fluorescent imaging of brain tumor with IR780 dye incorporated phospholipid nanoparticles BACKGROUND: Near-IR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging is becoming a promising approach in preclinical tumor detection and clinical image-guided oncological surgery. While heptamethine cyanine dye IR780 has excellent tumor targeting and imaging potential, its hydrophobic property limits its clinical use. In this study, we developed nanoparticle formulations to facilitate the use of IR780 for fluorescent imaging of malignant brain tumor.METHODS: Self-assembled IR780-liposomes and IR780-phospholipid micelles were prepared and their NIRF properties were characterized. The intracellular accumulation of IR780-nanoparticles in glioma cells were determined using confocal microscopy. The in vivo brain tumor targeting and NIRF imaging capacity of IR780-nanoparticles were evaluated using U87MG glioma ectopic and orthotopic xenograft models and a spontaneous glioma mouse model driven by RAS/RTK activation.RESULTS: The loading of IR780 into liposomes or phospholipid micelles was efficient. The particle diameter of IR780-liposomes and IR780-phospholipid micelles were 95 and 26 nm, respectively. While stock solutions of each preparation were maintained at ready-to-use condition, the IR780-phospholipid micelles were more stable. In tissue culture cells, IR780-nanoparticles prepared by either method accumulated in mitochondria, however, in animals the IR780-phospholipid micelles showed enhanced intra-tumoral accumulation in U87MG ectopic tumors. Moreover, IR780-phospholipid micelles also showed preferred intracranial tumor accumulation and potent NIRF signal intensity in glioma orthotopic models at a real-time, non-invasive manner.CONCLUSION: The IR780-phospholipid micelles demonstrated tumor-specific NIRF imaging capacity in glioma preclinical mouse models, providing great potential for clinical imaging and image-guided surgery of brain tumors.",Excluded

No significant risk factors have been identified and no evidence-based treatment guidelines are currently available. Case Report: A 56-year-old EOC patient presented with seizure at the Emergency Department eleven days after completion of fourth-line chemotherapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PhD). A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple metastases. The patient received radiotherapy with a total dose of 30.8 Gy and 8 cycles of paclitaxel resulting in stable disease. Based on the current literature, treatment options are discussed. Conclusion(s): Therapeutic options for brain metastases include radiation, systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, surgery or a combination regime. Since the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy remains controversial, current research focuses on developing new anticancer drugs that penetrate the blood-brain barrier in order to prevent and/or treat brain metastases.",Excluded
1163,"Radiation dose response of normal brain Dose response relationships were determined after hemibrain x-irradiation of normal beagle dogs. Radiation doses of 11.5, 13.5, 14.3, and 17 Gy were delivered in a single dose and results were compared to previous studies using doses of 15 and 30 Gy. Brain injury was quantified using computed tomography (CT), with serial studies obtained monthly up to 1 year following irradiation. Quantitative endpoints included low density volume and contrast enhancement. Doses above 14.3 Gy resulted in high lethality 5-8 months following irradiation, and an LD50 of 14.9 Gy was calculated. At these lethal doses, low density volume representing edema, demyelination, and necrosis had a similar response with an ED50 of 14.6 Gy. Radiation-induced decreases in white matter density appeared 5-6 months after sublethal doses (less than or equal to 14.3 Gy) and the volume of tissue characterized by this low density increased with time and dose. This sublethal low density change had an ED50 of 12.8 Gy, and may reflect a loss or generalized atrophy of glial cells and/or myelin. These results show that: (a) the dose response curves obtained after hemibrain x-irradiation are extremely steep; and (b) at least two processes may be involved in the development of late radiation damage, one that is rapid upon onset (a ""delayed acute"" reaction) and the other which is a slower and more degenerative process.",Included

2397,"Quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow velocity and intracellular motility using dynamic light scattering-optical coherence tomography This paper describes a novel optical method for label-free quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracellular motility (IM) in the rodent cerebral cortex. This method is based on a technique that integrates dynamic light scattering (DLS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), named DLS-OCT. The technique measures both the axial and transverse velocities of CBF, whereas conventional Doppler OCT measures only the axial one. In addition, the technique produces a three-dimensional map of the diffusion coefficient quantifying nontranslational motions. In the DLS-OCT diffusion map, we observed high-diffusion spots, whose locations highly correspond to neuronal cell bodies and whose diffusion coefficient agreed with that of the motion of intracellular organelles reported in vitro in the literature. Therefore, the present method has enabled, for the first time to our knowledge, label-free imaging of the diffusion-like motion of intracellular organelles in vivo. As an example application, we used the method to monitor CBF and IM during a brief ischemic stroke, where we observed an induced persistent reduction in IM despite the recovery of CBF after stroke. This result supports that the IM measured in this study represent the cellular energy metabolism-related active motion of intracellular organelles rather than free diffusion of intracellular macromolecules.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): An online survey was administered to physicians in the US, UK, Germany, France, Brazil, and Italy to collect data on patients with advanced NET. The survey gathered data on the incidence and frequency of resource use (e.g. chemotherapy, somatostatin analogs [SSA], PRRT). Result(s): Of the 4,100 surveys administered, 197 physicians participated (4.8%), providing data for 394 NET patients. Among all patients, nonpancreatic GI tract was the most common primary site (45.4%), followed by pancreas (30.7%). Resource utilization was high across tumour types as shown in Table 1. The most common types of chemotherapy used were: 5-fluorouracil (16.2%), etoposide (15.5%), and cisplatin (14.8%).

3344,"The Impact of body-only proton radiation on immune-CNS communication Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an established treatment for many hematological disorders including lymphomas and leukemias. Although the prognosis after HSCT has historically been poor, associated with high mortality rates, advances in treatment have led to increases in long-term survival and, consequently, an increased risk for neuropsychological dysfunction. Roughly 40% of all allogeneic HSCTs performed in 2006-2010 involved total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning. Previously, we reported that many TBI-induced changes in splenic phagocytic populations were mitigated by chlorisondamine (CHL), a non-selective nicotinic blocker that crosses the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we characterized the effects of body-only proton irradiation (excluding brain) and CHL on the response to a bacterial challenge in 8- to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Mice were given CHL (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and irradiated (0 or 3 Gy) 60-90 min later. Ten days post-irradiation, mice were inoculated with 5e7 CFU of Escherichia coli (i.p.) and euthanized 90-120 min later. We characterized blood and splenic leukocyte population distributions (flow cytometry and hematology), cytokine levels (multiplexed cytokine analysis) and oxidative burst capacity. Radiation decreased virtually all splenic leukocyte counts while increasing oxidative burst capacity. In the blood, radiation decreased lymphocytes but increased innate subsets. Sympathetic blockade did not counter most of these radiation effects. This suggests that the disruptive effect of TBI on brain-immune communication is dependent on direct exposure to the brain.",Included

The tumor sites in these patients were: breast (n = 41), lung (n = 4), head and neck (n = 3) as well as prostate, bladder, rectal cancer and Hodgkin's disease (each n = 1). Twenty-six of them were examined prior to planned radiotherapy (prospective group) and 26 after radiotherapy (retrospective group). Three additional individuals (without cancer or radiotherapy) with proven ataxia telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome, AT-homozygotes) were also investigated and their blood samples served as positive control for radiosensitivity. The clinical radiation response of normal tissue in radiotherapy patients was scored according to the WHO grading system for acute and according to the RTOG grading system for late effects. For to estimate the intrinsic radiosensitivity, blood samples were taken and irradiated in vitro with 0 (control) or 0.7 or 2 Gy with a 6 MV-linear accelerator, standard 48-hour lymphocyte cultures were prepared, chromosomes #1, #2 and #4 were simultaneously labeled with a FISH/CISS-technique and 200 to 1,000 metaphase spreads were scored for chromosomal aberrations. The radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes was expressed as the number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks per mitosis after 0.7 Gy or 2 Gy corrected for the 0-Gy control value.RESULTS: The frequency of chromosomal breaks/mitosis in the unirradiated control lymphocytes was 0.020 +/- 0.015 in prospective patients who had not yet received radiotherapy. It was significantly higher in retrospective patients (0.264 +/- 0.164 breaks/mitosis) as a result of the previous radiation exposure. The 3 AT-homozygotes showed also an increased number of spontaneous chromosomal breaks (0.084 +/- 0.016 breaks/mitosis), probably resulting from the chromosomal instability in this disease. This figure, however, was significantly lower than in retrospective patients. The number of radiation-induced breaks after in-vitro irradiation was comparable in lymphocytes of patients who showed no normal tissue reaction (n = 11) as compared to those with mild to moderate radiation reaction (n = 32, acute reactions Grade 1 to 2, late reactions Grade 0 to 2). In 9 patients with unexpected severe plus late Grade 3 to 4 reactions, however, a significantly higher number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks was measured; the highest number was observed in a patient with a radiation myelitis. The 3 AT-homozygotes showed, as expected, an extreme radiosensitivity of their lymphocytes. The number of breaks/mitosis after 0.7 Gy in vitro irradiation of lymphocytes was 0.103 +/- 0.059 in patients with no normal tissue radiation reaction (n = 11), 0.122 +/- 0.146 in the group with mild to moderate radiation reactions Grade 1 to 2 (n = 32), 0.359 + 0.226 in patients with unexpected Grade 3 to 4 normal tissue reactions (n = 9) and 0.550 +/- 0.243 in the 3 AT-homozygotes (p < 0.01, t-test). The difference in lymphocyte radiosensitivity between these 4 groups was also detected after in-vitro irradiation with 2 Gy (0.484 +/- 0.132 vs. 0.535 +/- 0.228 vs. 0.926 +/- 0.349 vs. 1.423 +/- 0.072).CONCLUSIONS: We found a significantly higher number of chromosomal breaks in lymphocytes of patients with severe or extreme radiation reaction of normal tissues as compared to patients with no or only mild to moderate radiation reactions. The radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in these radiosensitive patients was in the range between normal radiosensitivity and the radiosensitivity of AT-homozygotes.

2948,"Regulation of prostaglandin E2 synthesis after brain irradiation PURPOSE: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels seen after radiation treatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE2 production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE2 production and PGES expression.RESULTS: As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE2 levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE2 seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE2 production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities.",Included

The main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a new quinolone derivative; 2-(1-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid (EHQA) and its possible mechanism against gamma radiation (IRR) and cisplatin (Cis) induced nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity in mice. The structure of the newly synthesized quinolone derivative was elucidated by microanalytical and spectral data, which were found consistent with the assigned structures. Exposure to Cis and IRR significantly induced renal damage manifested by a significant increase in levels of urea and creatinine. Moreover, the exposure to both Cis and IRR significantly decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic protein; Bcl-2 in both renal and brain tissue homogenate accompanied by activation of an inflammatory marker; IL-17. Immunophenoting results showed an activation of T- lymphocytes marker; CD3 and B-lymphocytes marker; CD19. Interperitonial administration of EHQA significantly ameliorated the above-mentioned parameters. Overall, the present results indicated that EHQA is a promising anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent.

Primary explanatory variables were peritumoural and/or tumoural glutamate concentrations, glutamate transporter expression (EAAT2 and SXC). Univariate and multivariate survival analysis was performed with primary outcomes of time to first post-operative seizure and overall survival. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with de novo glioblastomas who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. 47 (21.8 %), 34 (15.8 %) and 135 (62.5 %) WHO grade II, III and IV gliomas respectively were followed for a median of 15.8 months. Following multivariate analysis, there was a non-significant association between higher peritumoural glutamate concentrations and time to first post-operative seizure (HR 2.07, CI 0.98-4.37, p = 0.06). In subgroup analysis of 81 glioblastoma patients who received adjunct chemoradiotherapy, peritumoural glutamate concentration was significantly associated with time to first post-operative seizure (HR 3.10, CI 1.20-7.97, p = 0.02). In both the overall cohort and subgroup analysis no glutamate cycle biomarkers were predictive of overall survival. Increased concentrations of peritumoural glutamate were significantly associated with shorter periods of post-operative seizure freedom in patients with de novo glioblastomas treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. No glutamate cycle biomarkers were predictive of overall survival. These results suggest that therapies targeting glutamate may be beneficial in tumour associated epilepsy.",Excluded

2772,"Gamma Knife surgery for adrenocorticotropic hormone-producing pituitary adenomas after bilateral adrenalectomy OBJECT: Patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas may require a bilateral adrenalectomy to treat their Cushing's disease. Approximately one third of these patients, however, will experience progressive enlargement of the residual pituitary adenoma, develop hyperpigmentation, and have an elevated level of serum ACTH. These patients with Nelson's syndrome can be treated with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS).METHODS: The prospectively collected University of Virginia Gamma Knife database of patients with pituitary adenomas was reviewed to identify all individuals with Nelson's syndrome who were treated with GKS. Twenty-three patients with a minimum of 6 months of follow up were identified in the database. These patients were assessed for tumor control (that is, lack of tumor growth over time) with neuroimaging studies (median follow-up duration 22 months) and for biochemical normalization of their ACTH levels (median follow-up duration 50 months). Neuroimaging follow-up studies were available for 22 patients, and endocrine follow up was available for 15 patients in whom elevation of ACTH levels was documented prior to GKS. In the 22 patients in whom neuroimaging follow-up studies were available, 12 had a decrease in tumor size, eight had no tumor growth, and two had an increase in tumor volume. Ten of 15 patients with elevated ACTH levels prior to GKS showed a decrease in their ACTH levels at last follow up; three of these 10 patients achieved normal ACTH levels (< 50 pg/ml) and the other five patients with initially elevated values had an increase in ACTH levels. Ten patients were thoroughly evaluated for post-GKS pituitary function; four were found to have new pituitary hormone deficiency and six did not have hypopituitarism after GKS. One patient suffered a permanent third cranial nerve palsy and four patients are now deceased.CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery may control the residual pituitary adenoma and decrease ACTH levels in patients with Nelson's syndrome. Delayed hypopituitarism or cranial nerve palsies can occur after GKS. Patients with Nelson's syndrome require continued multidisciplinary follow-up care. Given the difficulties associated with management of Nelson's syndrome, even the modest results of GKS may be helpful for a number of patients.",Excluded
3357,"Role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSCs radiation response; regeneration or senescence? Purpose or Objective Secretory function restoration is a challenge for regenerative therapy of radiation-damaged salivary glands. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed to allow such a functional regeneration. It has been suggested that glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes survival of mice salivary gland stem cells (mSGSCs). GDNF-treatment in combination with stem cell based regenerative therapy could represent a promising treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and consequential xerostomia. However, the role of GDNF on SGSC survival and proliferation after therapeutic irradiation is still an enigma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSC response to irradiation. Material and Methods Salivary gland organoid derived cells of Gdnf hypermorphic (Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup>) and wild-type mice (Gdnfwt/wt) were irradiated (IR) with gamma-rays at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy. mSGSC survival and stemness were assessed by calculating stem cell surviving fraction measured as post- IR organoid forming potential and population doublings. Flow cytometry was used to determine the CD24<sup>hi</sup>/CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell (SC) population. qPCR and immunofluorescence were used to detect GDNF expression. Six-day-old salivary gland organoids were irradiated with 7 Gy of yrays, IR induced organoids senescence were confirmed by SA-s-Gal and P16 staining. Results Exogenously added GDNF or increase expression of GDNF in hypermorphic mice SGSC induced an increase in secondary organoids formation efficiency when compared to wild-type mice/untreated SG (p<0.05). However, neither endogenous nor exogenous GDNF increased the CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell-like population. Organoids IR surviving fraction (OSF) of mSGSCs were similar albeit resulted in larger spheres and an increased cell number in the Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> compared to Gdnfwt/wt group. Indeed, mSGSC of Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> mice showed high sphere forming efficiency upon replating. Cell cycle distribution of SGSC after irradiation had no difference with or without GDNF. Interestingly, GDNF expression was highly upregulated after irradiation both in vitro (p=0.008) and in vivo (p<0.05) but normalized in vivo after mSGSC transplantation-related regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) expression was strongly related to OSF (r=0.842, p=0.002) and co-localized with GDNF in salivary gland striated ducts. More than 90% IR induced senescence located in striated ducts where GDNF colocalized with senescence marker p16 and SA-s-Gal. Interestingly, senescence cells were detected in organoids after IR. Conclusion GDNF does not protect mSGSCs against irradiation but seems to promote mSGSCs proliferation through the GDNF-RET signaling pathway. Post-transplantation stimulation of GDNF/RET pathway may enhance the regenerative potential of mSGSCs. IR induced upregulation of GDNF may be involved in IR induced senescence.",Included

A 70-yr-old male with history of radiosurgery for AVM presented with aphasia and confusion. Preoperative angiography showed complete occlusion of the AVM. MRI showed multiple cystic lesions suspicious for radiation-induced necrosis and CM. IRB approval and patient consent was obtained. A pterional craniotomy was performed with transsylvian exposure of the insula. The radiated feeding arteries were followed to the occluded AVM nidus. A CM was noted deep to this candelabra of the MCA vessels, which were mobilized to access and resect the CM. A small incision was made in this insular cortex underneath the malformation circumferentially freeing it of adhesions. The sclerotic AVM nidus was circumferentially dissected and removed en bloc. Thorough exploration of the resection cavity revealed no residual CM or AVM nidus. Attention was then turned to the M2-MCA bifurcation aneurysm, which was occluded with a straight clip. Postoperative imaging confirmed complete CM resection. The patient recovered from his aphasia. This case demonstrates the management of a radiation-induced de novo CM following treatment of a high-grade AVM. Radiographic follow-up for radiosurgically treated AVM is needed to rule out long-term complications. Bleeding from a de novo CM mimics bleeding from residual AVM nidus, requiring careful angiographic evaluation. Copyright Â© 2019 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded
723,"Radiographic Features of Metastatic Brain Tumors from ALK-rearranged Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Implications for optimal treatment modalities Purpose: To investigate the radiological features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain metastases (BM) from ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated data from 40 eligible patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Radiographic features of metastatic brain tumors, including the number, size, location, and peritumoral brain edema size (PBES), were delineated using MRI. Result(s): 13 patients had metachronous BM (MBM), having developed BM at least 6 months after diagnosis with NSCLC. The remaining patients were categorized as having synchronous BM (SBM). Compared with patients in the SBM group, patients in the MBM group were found to have more favorable values for radiological features including BM number, BM size, and PBES. Ten (76.9%) of the 13 patients with MBM had <=3 lesions and were asymptomatic, and none had developed a diffuse BM pattern, supporting the adoption of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the majority of these patients and against the administration of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Conversely, among the 27 patients with SBM, 15 (55.6%) patients had >3 lesions and 12 (44.4%) patients were symptomatic, highlighting the necessity of rapidly administrating brain radiotherapy, either as SRS or whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Importantly, only two patients (5.0%) had metastases in the hippocampus and peri-hippocampus region, and both were in the SBM group, indicating the feasibility of hippocampal avoidance WBRT in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Conclusion(s): Both WBRT and SRS are appropriate for the treatment of BM in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. The incidence of BM in the hippocampus and peri-hippocampus region is low in our radiological data. Nearly 80% of patients with metachronous BM have oligo-metastatic lesions, indicating that SRS is the preferred therapy while PCI is not indicated. Copyright Â© The author(s).",Excluded

3280,"The contribution of DNA and chromosome repair deficiencies to the radiosensitivity of ataxia-telangiectasia Cells derived from individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased chromosome aberrations at mitosis when compared with normal cell lines. Our previous studies showed that, despite similar initial levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), AT cells express higher initial chromosome damage than do normal cells as demonstrated by the technique of premature chromosome condensation. However, this finding accounted for only a portion of the increased sensitivity (T. K. Pandita and W. N. Hittelman, Radiat. Res. 130, 94-103, 1992). The purpose of the study reported here was to examine the contribution of DNA and chromosome repair to the radiosensitivity of AT cells. Exponentially growing AT and normal lymphoblastoid cells were fractionated into cell cycle phase-enriched populations by centrifugal elutriation, and their DNA and chromosome repair characteristics were evaluated by DNA neutral filter elution (for DNA DSBs) and by premature chromosome condensation, respectively. AT cells exhibited a reduced fast-repair component in both G1- and G2-phase cells, as observed at the level of both DNA DSBs and the chromosome; however, S-phase cells showed nearly normal DNA DSB repair. The findings that AT cells exhibit an increased level of chromosome damage and a deficiency in the fast component (but not the slow component) of repair suggest that chromatin organization might play a major role in the observed sensitivity of AT cells. When survival was plotted as a function of the residual amount of chromosome damage in G1- and G2- phase cells after 90 min of repair, the curves for normal and AT cells approached each other but did not overlap. These results suggest that, although higher initial levels of chromosome damage and reduced chromosome repair capability can explain much of the radiosensitivity of AT cells, other differences in AT cells must also contribute to their sensitivity phenotype.",Included
2798,"Effects of combined immune and radiation cancer therapy on inflammatory environment in the brain of a mouse model Purpose/Objective(s): Cancer patients often report behavioral and cognitive changes following cancer treatment. These can include difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and increased anxiety. Though changes are often associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or cranial irradiation, these effects are also seen in patients who receive peripheral but no cranial irradiation and no chemotherapy. A proinflammatory environment in the brain may mediate these effects. Neuroinflammation mediates cognitive impairments in other neurological disorders. Its role in cancer-related neurological dysfunction is likely relevant given novel treatments combining peripheral radiotherapy (RT) with immune activation. However, little is known about how these treatments might affect the brain, in individuals with or without tumors. Our preliminary research has identified an association between treatments combining immune activation and RT and impairments in cognitive measures. Here, we investigate the role of neuroinflammation in these effects. We hypothesize that cognitive impairments following treatment with immunotherapy and RT will be associated with increased expression of neuromodulatory inflammatory cytokines. Materials/Methods: Our project utilizes anti-CTLA4 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy preceding precision CT-guided peripheral RT to closely model clinical treatment. C57BL/6J mice with or without injected hind flank 3LL lung carcinoma were used. Mice received sham, RT-only, anti-CTLA4-only, or RT+anti-CTLA4 treatment. Mice were exposed to two identical objects and 24 hours later reintroduced to one familiar object and one novel object. Mice that recognize the familiar object will spend more time exploring the novel object. The percent time exploring the novel object out of the total time exploring both objects is calculated to determine object recognition. Following cognitive testing, brain tissue was harvested and used in an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 20-plex (GM-CSF, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-1b, IL-4, MIG, KC, VEGF, IL-17, MIP-1a, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, IL-5, FGF-Basic, IL-1a, IFN-g, IL-13, MCP-1, and IP-10). Result(s): In the animals that did not receive tumors, object recognition was seen in control mice and mice receiving either RT or anti-CTLA-4 alone, but not in mice receiving both treatments. In mice receiving tumors, only the mice that received RT alone showed novel object recognition. Conclusion(s): While combining immune activation and RT optimizes tumor control, it is associated with cognitive impairments. Data from 20-plex are currently being analyzed. We will determine how levels of cytokines and chemokines might be altered by the various treatments and whether they are associated with behavioral and cognitive performance. These results will be presented at the meeting.",Included
1145,"p53 tumor suppressor protein regulates the levels of huntingtin gene expression The p53 protein is a transcription factor that integrates various cellular stress signals. The accumulation of the mutant huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract plays a central role in the pathology of human Huntington's disease. We found that the huntingtin gene contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and p53 binds to these elements both in vivo and in vitro. p53 activation in cultured human cells, either by a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 protein or by gamma-irradiation (gamma-irradiation), increases huntingtin mRNA and protein expression. Similarly, murine huntingtin also contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and its expression is induced by p53 activation in cultured cells. Moreover, gamma-irradiation, which activates p53, increases huntingtin gene expression in the striatum and cortex of mouse brain, the major pathological sites for Huntington's disease, in p53+/+ but not the isogenic p53-/- mice. These results demonstrate that p53 protein can regulate huntingtin expression at transcriptional level, and suggest that a p53 stress response could be a modulator of the process of Huntington's disease.",Included

246,"Palliative radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer The palliative treatment of patients with NSCLC should be individualized. Treatment decisions should be directed by the goal of maximizing the patient's quality of life, and the patient's wishes should always be ascertained. The approaches to palliative radiation treatment of the chest, bones, and brain are quite similar. Treatment of the chest and bones is usually reserved until symptoms are significant. Brain metastases are generally treated soon after diagnosis. With respect to dose- fractionation schedules, the data are not conclusive. In theory, more protracted schedules of 40 to 50 Gy in 4 to 5 weeks are associated with more durable responses and less long-term morbidity than are shorter and lower- dose schedules. These regimens are therefore worth considering for the most favorable subset of palliative patients (ie, those with good performance status and low burden of disease). At the other end of the spectrum, very ill patients with poor performance status may be best served by short hypofractionated schedules such as 20 Gy in five fractions, 17 Gy in two fractions, or possibly 8 to 10 Gy in one fraction. Response rates with these regimens are good, trips to the treatment facility are minimized, and these ill patients will probably not live long enough to experience the higher long-term toxicity rates associated with larger treatment fractions. The majority of patients, however, fall between these two extremes and are well served by schedules such as 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Radiation treatment fields should not be excessive but cover gross disease with a limited margin. (In the setting of brain metastases, treatment of the whole brain is recommended.) Further study of palliative treatment approaches should focus not only on assessments of response and toxicity but also on the impact of different treatments on overall quality of life.",Excluded

In 2-week-old control rats, labelled cells were already distributed homogeneously throughout the bulb, while in the experimental animals, a (newborn- and early postnatal-type) radial arrangement of immunoreactive fibres continued to persist even until the end of the fourth postnatal week. This delay in the maturation of the GFAP-immunopositive glial system may contribute to the hindered development of the bulbar neurones, neuronal connections, and field potentials, as found in earlier studies.",Excluded

980,"Anti-inflammatory effects of tanshinone IIA on radiation-induced microglia BV-2 cells inflammatory response AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the inhibitory effects of Tanshinone II(A) on the production of proinflammation cytokines in radiation-stimulated microglia.METHODS: Microglia cells were treated with 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 Gy of irradiation or sham-irradiated in the presence or absence of 1.0 microg/mL of Tanshinone II(A). The effects of Tanshinone II(A) on radiation-induced proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction; the expression level of nuclear factor (NF-kappabeta) p65 in cytoplasm and nucleus was measured by Western blot. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy analysis were applied to detect the expression of gamma-H2AX and p65 postirradiation.RESULTS: Radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines in BV-2 cells was detectable after irradiation. Tanshinone II(A) decreased the radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines. Further, Western blotting showed that Tanshinone II(A) could attenuate the nuclear translocation of (NF-kappabeta) p65 submit postirradiation. Immunofluorescence staining showed gamma-H2AX foci formation with p65 translocation into the nucleus postirradiation.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that Tanshinone II(A) exerts anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes that might be associated with the NF-kappabeta signaling pathway. It is postulated that irradiation causes immediate cellular reaction, and that double-strand breaks trigger the molecular response that leads to NF-kappabeta pathway activation.",Included
375,"[Effects of parabolic flight on redox status in SH-SY5Y cells] Space flight is known to produce a number of neurological disturbances. The etiology is unknown, but it may involve increased oxidative stress. A line of experimental evidence indicates that space flight may disrupt antioxidant defense system and result in increased oxidative stress. In vitro studies found that abundant of NO was produced in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and protein nitration was increased in PC12 cells within a simulated microgravity rotating wall bioreactor high aspect ratio vessel system or clinostat system. In the present study, we observed the change of redox status in SH-SY5Y cells after parabolic flight, and studied the effects of key redox molecule, thioredoxin (TRX), during the altered gravity. SH-SY5Y cells were divided into four groups: control cells, control cells transfected with TRX, flight cells and flight cells transfected with TRX. The expression levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TRX and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR) were observed by immunocytochemical method. It was shown that after parabolic flight, the staining of 3-NT and TRX were enhanced, while the expression level of TRXR was down-regulated compared with control. As for flight cells transfected with TRX, the staining of 3-NT and iNOS were weakened compared with flight cells. These results obtained suggest that altered gravity may increase protein nitration, down-regulate TRXR and elicit oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells, while TRX transfection could partly protect cells against oxidative stress induced by parabolic flight.",Excluded
699,"Photobiomodulation Using a Low-Level Light-Emitting Diode Improves Cognitive Dysfunction in the 5XFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease Photobiomodulation using low-level light-emitting diode can be rapidly applied in neurological and physiological disorders safely and noninvasively. Photobiomodulation is effective for chronic diseases because of fewer side effects than drugs. Here we investigated the effects of photobiomodulation using light-emitting diode on amyloid plaques, gliosis, and neuronal loss to prevent and/or recover cognitive impairment, and optimal timing of photobiomodulation initiation for recovering cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. 5XFAD mice were used as an Alzheimer's disease model. Animals receiving photobiomodulation treatment were divided into two groups: an early group starting photobiomodulation at 2 months of age (5XFAD+Early), and a late group starting photobiomodulation at 6 months of age (5XFAD+Delay). Both groups received photobiomodulation 20 minutes per session three times per week for 14 weeks. The Morris water maze, passive avoidance, and elevated plus maze tests were performed at 10 months of age. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed after behavioral evaluation. The results showed that photobiomodulation treatment at early stages reduced amyloid accumulation, neuronal loss, and microgliosis and alleviated the cognitive dysfunction in 5XFAD mice, possibly by increasing insulin degrading enzyme related to amyloid-beta degradation. Photobiomodulation may be an excellent candidate for advanced preclinical Alzheimer's disease research.",Excluded

105,"Use of non-ablative dose of radiation to enhance delivery of unmodified morpholino oligonucleotides in a brain tumor model to silence mgmt and enhance the efficacy of chemo-radiation Objective: Non-ablative Ionizing radiation ( XRT) is well known to alter neuro-vascular unit (NVU) permeability. We evaluate the use of XRT to enhance delivery of intravenously administered Morpholino Oligonucleotides designed to silence O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in a MGMT expressing human derived brain tumor xenograft model. Background(s): MGMT, a key DNA repair enzyme is associated with resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). We have previously reported the use of a non-ablative dose of ionizing radiation (XRT) to prime human cancer cells to enhance the uptake of unmodified anti-MGMT morpholino oligonucleotides (AMONs) to achieve statistically significant reduction in the in-vitro proliferation index and cell viability with a single dose of AMONs and TMZ. Our prior work has demonstrated that this is by enlarge mediated by up regulation of physiologic endocytosis after XRT. Design/Methods: Intracranial tumor (MGMT expressing human derived H460 non-small cell lung cancer, n=12) bearing athymic nude rats received a single dose of cranial radiation (2Gy) with oral TMZ for 4 consecutive days starting on the day of XRT. In addition, six animals were randomly selected to receive AMON (10.5mg/kg) 24 hrs after XRT, the remaining served as controls. All animals were euthanized and brains harvested 7 days after XRT and tumor volumes measured by immunoblotting. This experiments was repeated in human derived D283 medulloblastoma xenografts (n=12) Results: A 60% (p=0.034) reduction in MGMT expression was noted in brain tumors treated with XRT and iv AMONs. Although not significant, a 40% reduction in tumors volumes were noted in the animals treated with a single dose of AMONs and chemo-radiation. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate the first use of XRT to guide and enhance delivery of AMONS to brain tumors. In this proof of concept study, silencing MGMT enhances the toxicity of XRT and TMZ. This approach warrants further evaluation and may improve outcomes in patients with tumors with un-methylated MGMT.",Excluded

2718,"CEP-1347 (KT7515), an inhibitor of JNK activation, rescues sympathetic neurons and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells from death evoked by three distinct insults The c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascade appears to play a role in some cases of cell death, including neuronal apoptosis. CEP-1347 (KT7515), an indolocarbazole of the K252a family, blocks this stress signaling cascade and promotes survival. Here, we used CEP-1347 to probe whether neuronal death pathways activated by distinct insults also possess elements in common. Cultured rat sympathetic neurons and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were induced to die by withdrawal of nerve growth factor, exposure to ultraviolet irradiation, or subjection to oxidative stress. In each case, death was prevented by 100-200 nM CEP-1347. Moreover, in each of these death paradigms, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activity in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells was elevated by two- or threefold, and this increase was totally blocked by CEP-1347 at concentrations that promoted survival. In contrast, 200 nM CEP-1347 did not block death due to serum withdrawal from undifferentiated PC12 cells or to activation of Fas in Jurkat T cell cultures, even though in each case c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activation occurred and was inhibited by CEP-1347. These observations suggest that some but not all death pathways triggered by different insults can include a common mechanistic component, a likely candidate for which is activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascade.",Excluded

Results of splenic irradiation in patients with myelofibrosis or chronic leukemia were retrospectively analyzed.PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 24 patients: 15 presented with MF and 9 with CML. Median irradiation doses were 9.8 and 7.7 Gy, respectively. The hematologic toxicity was moderate (except for platelets in the acute phase of the disease).RESULTS: No toxicity was observed. Various factors predictive of the response to radiation therapy are described. While high (around 14 Gy) radiation therapy dose appears necessary for MF and should be started before the increase in transfusion need, huge splenomegalies should be excluded in regard to CML. As for other cases, the optimal dose is still unclear, but should probably be high enough, ie, around 10 Gy.CONCLUSION: To further study and better understand biological mechanisms underlying response to radiotherapy in patients with MF, prospective radio-chemotherapy phase II trials should be conducted in both CML and MF patients.",Excluded
117,"Irradiation inactivation studies of the dopamine D1 receptor and dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in rat striatum In frozen rat striatal tissue, exposed to 10 MeV electrons from a linear accelerator, the sizes of the dopamine (DA) D1 receptor and the DA-sensitive adenylate cyclase complex were determined using target size analysis. The number of D1 receptors (labelled by [3H]SCH 23390) declined monoexponentially with increasing radiation intensity, yielding a molecular weight (mol.wt.) of 80 kDa. Also the activity of the catalytic unit (C) of the adenylate cyclase (as measured by forskolin stimulation), decreased monoexponentially, however with a mol.wt. of 145 kDa. Both basal, DA- and fluoride (F-)-stimulated activity declined in a concave-downward fashion with a limiting mol.wt. of 134, 138 and 228 kDa, respectively. It was estimated that the basal and DA-stimulated activity originated from an enzyme complex with a mol.wt. of 325 kDa, a value close to the combined size of RGs and C. These data suggest that F- stimulation of the adenylate cyclase, which occurs by a Gs activation, does not cause dissociation of Gs into the alpha s and beta gamma subunits. Further, the DA-regulated adenylate cyclase apparently exists as a complex consisting of RGs and C; the mechanism of hormonal activation is a dissociation of C from this complex.",Included

A case-control study in long-term survivors from cancer in the head and neck region BACKGROUND: Adult patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disorders have compromised quality of life (QoL). Whether this is due to their endocrine consequences (hypopituitarism), their underlying hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or both is still under debate. The aim of this trial was to measure quality of life (QoL) in long-term cancer survivors who have received a radiation dose to the basal part of the brain and the pituitary.METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=101) treated for oropharyngeal or epipharyngeal cancer with radiotherapy followed free of cancer for a period of 4 to10 years were identified. Fifteen patients (median age 56 years) with no concomitant illness and no hypopituitarism after careful endocrine evaluation were included in a case-control study with matched healthy controls. Doses to the hypothalamic-pituitary region were calculated. QoL was assessed using the Symptom check list (SCL)-90, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and Psychological Well Being (PGWB) questionnaires. Level of physical activity was assessed using the Baecke questionnaire.RESULTS: The median accumulated dose was 1.9 Gy (1.5-2.2 Gy) to the hypothalamus and 2.4 Gy (1.8-3.3 Gy) to the pituitary gland in patients with oropharyngeal cancer and 6.0-9.3 Gy and 33.5-46.1 Gy, respectively in patients with epipharyngeal cancer (n=2).

342,"Planning of radiotherapy with PET: Volumes only? Aim: We assess the percentage of cases in which findings of distant disease through 18F-FDG PET/CT for radiotherapy planning lead to changes in the modality and/or intent of the treatment, or change in stage IV. Material(s) and Method(s): All the studies derived from the Radiotherapy department were retrospectively analysed. Those performed for radiotherapy planning were selected. Cases with distant disease findings were assessed, investigating changes in the modality or intent of treatment and change in stage IV. One thousand four hundred seventy six studies were derived from the Radiotherapy department between April/09 and December/13. Three hundred and seventy three (25,3%) were performed for radiotherapy planning (267 males and 106 females, mean age 68.2 years). The intention of radiotherapy was for radical treatment planning. Result(s): In 45 of these studies (12%) there were previously not suspected findings that suggested an upstage of the patients to a clinical stage IV. The unexpected disease was located more frequently in bone (12 patients), followed by lung (9 patients), liver (10), distant adenopathy (6 patients), brain (4 patients), adrenal glands (4 patients), spleen (1 patient) and multiple progression (1 patient).In twenty-six (26/45, 7%) of these patients the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT were confirmed as true positive for distant metastasis with complementary examinations. In sixteen (16/26) of them the modality of treatment was changed. In ten of them (10/26) the intent of treatment was changed from curative to palliative.

However, it is well known that the clinical benefit from TMZ is lower in these patients. We sought to analyze patterns of care and outcomes of chemoradiation versus radiation alone in this cohort using a large, hospital database.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM from 2010 to 2012 who received radiation (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT) were identified in the National Cancer Database. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of receiving chemoradiation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess overall survival (OS) by treatment group and Cox regression analysis was used to assess impact of covariates on OS.RESULTS: There were 738 patients who met the study criteria, of which 107 (14.5%) received RT alone and 631 (85.5%) received CRT with median RT dose 6000cGy for both groups. Median follow up for living patients was 21.9 months. Ninety-two (12.5%) patients did not undergo any resection, 330 (44.7%) underwent a subtotal resection and 316 (42.8%) had a gross total resection. The median and 2-year OS was 16.8 months and 24.7% for RT alone compared to 15.6 months and 25.9% for the CRT group (p=0.250).

179,"Postoperative radiation for lung cancer metastatic to the brain PURPOSE: Although resection of single brain metastases and postoperative whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) improves survival, compared with treatment using WBRT alone, the value of postoperative WBRT after resection of brain metastases is controversial. We analyzed the largest reported series of lung cancer patients with resected brain metastases to evaluate the impact of postoperative WBRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1989, 185 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) underwent resection of brain metastases. Patients who had received preoperative WBRT (23%, 42 of 185) were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into group A (no WBRT; n = 32), group B (patients received WBRT and were prognostically matched to group A; n = 32), and group C (all other WBRT patients; n = 79). Most patients received postoperative doses of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Higher doses were used in 16% of group B and 18% of group C patients.RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival rates were as follows: group A, 12%; B, 8%; C, 16%. Overall brain failures occurred in 38% of patients in group A, 47% in group B, and 42% in group C. The use of WBRT (group A v groups B plus C) had no apparent impact on survival or on overall brain failure rates. In particular, no improvement in either of these parameters could be demonstrated when group B was compared with group A. Focal failure (defined as failure within the brain adjacent to the site of the resected brain metastases) occurred as follows: group A, 34% (11 of 32); groups B plus C, 23% (25 of 111) (P = .07). WBRT significantly reduced focal failure for patients with adenocarcinoma (group A, 33% [eight of 24]; groups B plus C, 14% [11 of 79]; P = .05). Nonfocal failure (anatomically distinct from the resected metastasis) occurred in 9% of patients in group A (three of 32), 21% in groups B plus C (23 of 111) (P = .07).CONCLUSION: Long-term survival is possible when NSCLC brain metastases are resected. Postoperative WBRT as used in this series only had an impact on the focal control of brain metastases and this effect was of borderline significance. The lack of conclusive benefit supports the need for ongoing randomized trials to test the value of adjuvant postoperative WBRT. Brain failures were relatively common in all three groups of patients, which suggests that doses greater than 30 Gy need to be studied.",Included

3576,"Some perturbations that disturb the circadian melatonin rhythm The circadian melatonin rhythm is highly reproducible and generally not easily altered. The few perturbations that are capable of significantly changing either the amplitude or the pattern of the 24-h melatonin rhythm are summarized herein. Aging alters cyclic melatonin production by decreasing the amplitude of the nocturnal melatonin peak in all species in which it has been studied. The best known acute suppressor of nocturnal melatonin is light exposure. The brightness of light required to acutely depress pineal melatonin production is species dependent; of the visible wavelengths, those in the blue range (approximately 500-520 nm) seem most effective in suppressing melatonin production. Nonvisible, nonionizing radiation in the extremely low frequency range (e.g., 60 Hz) seems also capable of altering pineal melatonin synthesis. Hormones have relatively little influence on the circadian production of melatonin, although either adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy does attenuate the amplitude of the melatonin cycle. Exercise at the time of high melatonin production rapidly depresses pineal concentrations of the indole without influencing its synthesis; the mechanism of this suppression remains unknown.

1911,"Safety of 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a well-characterized hemoglobinopathy affecting more than 20 million individuals worldwide and carries an increased risk of cerebral vasculopathy, cerebral infarct, and stroke. As mechanisms of cerebral infarction in SCD are partly attributable to microvascular vaso-occlusive crises, manifesting as altered cerebral blood flow and associated impaired oxygen delivery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods that can quickly provide a comprehensive perspective on structural and functional disease status, without exogenous contrast administration or ionizing radiation, have emerged as crucial clinical tools for surveillance. However, early ex vivo MRI work in suspended erythrocytes containing hemoglobin S at 0.35 Tesla (T) suggested that sickled erythrocytes can orient preferentially in the presence of an external magnetic field, and as such, it was suggested that MRI exams in sickle cell hemoglobinopathy could induce vaso-occlusion. While this observation has generally not impacted clinical imaging in individuals with SCD, it has led to resistance for some sickle cell studies within the engineering community among some imaging scientists as this early observation has never been rigorously shown to be unconcerning. Here, we performed MRI at the clinical field strength of 3 T in 172 patients with SCD, which included standard anatomical and angiographic assessments together with gold standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; spatial resolution = 1.8 x 1.8 x 4 mm; b-value = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) for acute infarct assessment (performed approximately 20 min after patient introduction to the field isocenter). The presence of vasculopathy, as well as chronic and acute infarcts, was evaluated by two independent board-certified radiologists using standard clinical criteria. In these patients (52.3% female; mean age = 19.6 years; age range = 6-44 years), hematocrit (mean = 25.8%; range = 15-36%), hemoglobin phenotype (87.8% HbSS variant), presence of silent infarct (44.2%), and overt chronic infarct (13.4%) were consistent with a typical SCD population; however, no participants exhibited evidence of acute infarction. These findings are consistent with 3 T MRI not inducing acute infarction or vaso-occlusion in individuals with SCD and suggest that earlier low-field ex vivo work of erythrocytes in suspension is not a sufficient cause to discourage MRI scans in patients with SCD.",Excluded

111,"Left fronto-temporal lobe dementia caused by gamma knife surgery in an elderly woman Introduction: Dementing processes in the geriatric population are devastating and can result in early death and increased care giver burden. FTD has the core features of earlier decline and impairment in regulation of social interpersonal conduct.We describe a case of an elderly female who was found to have features of FTD which had directly resulted from gamma knife surgery. This is the first described case of left FTD secondary to gamma knife radiation to our knowledge. Case: The patient is a 76 year old African American female, otherwise healthy and on no any medications with a history of a left frontotemporal arteriovenous malformation. She underwent gamma knife radiation treatment resulting in radiation necrosis eight years prior to presentation. She presented to the clinic escorted by her daughter who observed personality changes in the patient including becoming argumentative, uncooperative, and increasingly hyper religious, with increased interpersonal conflicts surrounding patient's inability to follow-through on plans. The patient only admitted to trouble with memory. Patient was observed to have disinhibition and inappropriateness during the group interview. Geriatric Depression Scale was negative for depression. Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 15/30 with deficits including: recall 0/5, language (1/3 naming, 0/2 repetition, 0/1 fluency with only 3 F words), calculation 0/3; while attention and orientations were intact. Patient was unable to perform Trail-making test, Part B. Otherwise, she appeared robust, independent in ADL but needing some assistance with IADL. Given her behavioral changes including tactlessness and poor social judgment, executive dysfunction, memory impairment and language deficits in the context of prior left frontal lobe radiation injury, she was given the diagnosis of left predominant FTD. Conclusion(s): Isolated and localized brain anomalies and their treatment are the rare causes of brain dysfunctions. In this unfortunate case, our patient's FTD is a direct result of her iatrogenic radiation necrosis. Appropriate diagnosis of this patient's condition via correlation of her cognitive deficit with radiographic findings allowed for appropriate counseling of both the patient and family in regards to the permanent nature of her condition. This in turn resulted in acceptance of her condition by her family, establishing prognosis and helping to facilitate her long term care plan.",Excluded
2667,"Which prognostic index is most appropriate in the setting of delayed stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases? Objectives: To determine if five commonly used prognostic indices (PIs) - recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), Score Index for Radiosurgery (SIR), Basic Score for Brain Metastases (BSBM), graded prognostic assessment (GPA), and the diagnosis-specific GPA - are valid following delay between diagnosis and treatment of brain metastases. Method(s): In a single-institutional cohort, records of patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) more than 30 days from diagnosis of brain metastases were collected, and five PI scores were calculated for each patient. For each PI, three score-based groupings were made to examine survival differences by means of adjusted log-rank analysis and area under the curve (AUC). Result(s): Of 121 patients with sufficient PI information, 72 underwent SRS more than 30 days after diagnosis. Median age and Karnofsky performance status were 60 years and 80, respectively. Forty-three (60%) patients had lung primaries. Prior to SRS, 38 (52.8%) and 12 (16.7%) patients underwent whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and surgery, respectively. Two (2.8%) patients underwent both WBRT and surgery prior to SRS. A median of two lesions were treated per SRS course. Median survival of the cohort was 9.0 months. Using adjusted log-rank analysis for pairwise comparison, BSBM and GPA showed significance between two out of the three prognostic groups, while the other scores showed either one or no significant differences on comparison. AUC demonstrated good applicability for BSBM, RPA, and GPA, although SIR was statistically less prognostic than the other PIs. Conclusion(s): The PIs analyzed in this study were applicable in the setting of delayed SRS. Although these data are hypothesis generating, they serve to encourage further analyses to validate a PI that is most optimal for these patients.

3123,"[Experimental data for administration of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for prevention of radiation myelopathy] BACKGROUND: Current models of radiation myelopathy provide a rationale for growth factor-based prevention strategies. Thus, we tested whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) alone or in combination modulate radiation tolerance of the rat cervical spinal cord.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cervical spinal cord of 68 adult Fisher F344 rats received a total dose of 30-36 Gy, given as a single fraction of 16 Gy followed by a second radiation dose of 14-20 Gy. Continuous intrathecal infusion of bFGF (44 rats) or saline (24 rats) into the cisterna magna was given concomitantly. A further experiment included 14 additional rats which were treated with subcutaneous injection of IGF-1 parallel to irradiation with a total dose of 34 Gy or 36 Gy. 20 rats received combined treatment, i.e. intrathecal infusion of bFGF plus subcutaneous injection of IGF-1, starting 24 hours before irradiation (total dose 33 Gy or 36 Gy) for a total of 4 days. Animals were followed until myelopathy developed or for a maximum of 12 months. Histopathologic examinations were performed post mortem.RESULTS: Treatment with bFGF alone or IGF-1 alone increased the median time to myelopathy significantly. In the 36-Gy group, after combination treatment a comparable prolongation of latency was seen. Moreover, rats treated with 33 Gy and combined bFGF plus IGF-1 showed a significantly reduced risk of myelopathy, too (p = 0.0015, Figures 1 and 2).CONCLUSION: Combination of IGF-1 and bFGF was more potent than single agent treatment. We observed a significantly reduced myelopathy rate at an intermediate radiation dose level and a longer time to myelopathy at a high-dose level. This finding strengthens the evidence that brief therapeutic intervention can decrease radiation-induced neurotoxicity. Further studies will be undertaken to optimize this strategy.",Excluded
3313,"The effect of a single whole-body irradiation with a lethal dose on catecholamine levels in the pineal glands of rats Male Wistar rats adapted to light-dark cycle (LD) 12:12 h were exposed in the darkness to a lethal single dose of 14.35 Gy gamma-rays on the whole body. Irradiation, sham-irradiation and decapitation 30, 60, 120 min after the exposure, were performed between 2000 h and 0100 h in the darkness. The changes in the concentrations of catecholamines (CA) were determined by the radioenzymatic method in the pineal gland of rats. Results were evaluated in comparison with those of the sham-irradiated (30, 60, 120 min) control groups of rats. From the results it follows that the concentration of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in the rat pineal gland significantly decreased 30 and 120 minutes after irradiation (p < 0.01). At min 60 of the postirradiation period it was possible to observe a tendency to recovery of the levels of DA and NE to control values.

The first 6 patients received IMA950 (9 major histocompatibility complex [MHC] class I and 2 MHC class II peptides) intradermally and poly-ICLC intramuscularly (i.m.). After protocol amendment, IMA950 and poly-ICLC were mixed and injected subcutaneously (n = 7) or i.m. (n = 6). Primary endpoints were safety and immunogenicity. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival at 6 and 9 months, and vaccine-specific peripheral cluster of differentiation (CD)4 and CD8 T-cell responses.RESULTS: The IMA950/poly-ICLC vaccine was safe and well tolerated. Four patients presented cerebral edema with rapid recovery. For the first 6 patients, vaccine-induced CD8 T-cell responses were restricted to a single peptide and CD4 responses were absent. After optimization of vaccine formulation, we observed multipeptide CD8 and sustained T helper 1 CD4 T-cell responses. For the entire cohort, CD8 T-cell responses to a single or multiple peptides were observed in 63.2% and 36.8% of patients, respectively.

1503,"Nontraumatic vascular emergencies: Imaging and intervention in acute occlusion Risk factors for acute venous occlusion range from prolonged immobilization to hypercoagulability syndromes, trauma, and malignancy. The aim of this review article is to illustrate the different imaging options for the diagnosis of acute venous occlusion and to assess the value of interventional strategies for venous thrombosis treatment in an emergency setting. First, diagnosis and treatment of the most common form of venous occlusion, at the level of the lower extremities, is presented, followed by pelvic vein and inferior vena cava occlusion, mesenteric venous thrombosis, upper extremity occlusion, acute cerebral vein thrombosis, and finally acute venous occlusion of hemodialysis access. In acute venous occlusion of the lower extremity phlebography is still the reference gold standard. Presently, duplex ultrasound with manual compression is the most sensitive and specific noninvasive test. Limitations of ultrasonography include isolated distal calf vein occlusion, obesity, and patients with lower extremity edema. If sonography is non-diagnostic, venography should be considered. Magnetic resonance venography can differentiate an acute occlusion from chronic thrombus, but because of its high cost and limited availability, it is not yet used for the routine diagnosis of lower extremity venous occlusion only. Regarding interventional treatment, catheter-directed thrombolysis can be applied to dissolve thrombus in charily selected patients with symptomatic occlusion and no contraindications to therapy. Acute occlusion of the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava, often due to extension from the femoropopliteal system, represents a major risk for pulmonary embolism. Color flow Doppler imaging is often limited owing to obesity and bowel gas. Venography has long been considered the gold standard for identifying proximal venous occlusion. Both CT scanning and MR imaging, however, can even more accurately diagnose acute pelvis vein or inferior vena cava occlusion. MRI is preferred because it is noninvasive, does not require contrast agent, carries no exposure to ionizing radiation, and is highly accurate and reproducible. Apart from catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy has proven to be a quick and safe treatment modality by enabling the recanalization of thrombotic occlusions in conjunction with minimal invasiveness and a low bleeding risk. Mechanical thrombectomy devices should only be used in conjunction with a temporary cava filter. Contrast-enhanced CT is at present considered the examination of choice for acute mesenteric vein occlusion which has mortality rates as high as 80%. Patients with proven acute mesenteric venous occlusion and contraindications to surgical therapy and no identified bleeding disposition without looming bowel ischemia or infarction are possible contenders to the less invasive percutaneous approach either by (in)direct thrombolysis or mechanical means. Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of upper extremity thrombosis. Computed tomography and MRI are in addition helpful in diagnosing central chest vein occlusions. The interventionalist is rarely involved in the treatment of this entity. Catheter-directed thrombolysis is known to improve lysis rates. Together with balloon angioplasty good results have been obtained. If stenosis or thrombus remains after thrombolysis and angioplasty, stent placement should follow. Within the first two weeks, thrombosed dural sinus and cerebral venous vessels are typically hyperdense on CT compared with brain parenchyma; after the course of 2 weeks, the thrombus will become isodense. In MRI an axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, an axial diffusion-weighted MRI, coronal T1-weighted spinecho and T2-weighted turbo-spinecho sequences, a coronal gradientecho and a 3D phase-contrast venous angiogram should be performed. Local thrombolysis is needed only when patients have an exacerbation of clinical symptoms or imaging signs of worsening disease despite sufficient anticoagulation therapy. Acute occlusions of dialysis grafts and fistulae are a frequently encountered complication. Among the various methods described for acute occlusion screening, ultrasonography and MRI have been proven to be accurate and noninvasive; however, if immediate treatment can be anticipated, imaging should be performed directly by digital subtraction angiography before the percutaneous intervention. Initial percutaneous thrombectomy is very effective with success rates and patency rates comparable to those of surgical thrombectomy. A short thrombosis can be treated with balloon angioplasty alone, whereas an extensive thrombosis requires a combination of mechanical devices and/or thrombolytic agents with adjunctive balloon angioplasty.",Excluded
2610,"Schizophrenia-like behavioral changes after partial hippocampal kindling The effect of hippocampal kindling on behavioral changes following 10 and 21 hippocampal afterdischarges (ADs) or electrographic seizures was examined in behaving rats. As compared to control, non-stimulated rats, 21 but not 10 hippocampal ADs resulted in a decrease in social contact, an increase in social isolation, and an increase in climbing and chasing behavior tested in an open field 3 days after cessation of kindling. Porsolt forced swimming test was not different among the control, 10- or 21-AD groups of rats. A deficit in sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition of an acoustic startle, was observed in kindled as compared to control rats at 2 weeks after 21 ADs, but not after 10 ADs. Similarly, methamphetamine (1 mg/kg i.p.) induced higher locomotor activity in kindled rats, as compared to controls, after 21 ADs but not after 10 ADs. Spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel cage, without drug administration, was not different between kindled and control rats. These findings suggest that behavioral alterations after repeated hippocampal electrographic seizures may be mediated by increased dopaminergic functions, which may also mediate the psychiatric symptoms in human epileptic patients.",Excluded

This syndrome involves a significantly decreased number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons compared to that in normal cells., the rate of fork movement and the fusion of neighbouring units in the group being unchanged. Ionizing radiation (5 Gy) does not change the rate of DNA chain growth in the cells derived from the affected individuals, however, it significantly reduces this parameter in normal cells due to inhibition of replicon initiation in the whole clusters. Thus, radioresistant DNA synthesis in chromosomal instability syndromes may be explained by some defect in DNA replication in unirradiated cells analogous to that in irradiated normal cells.",Included

3276,"Comparing DNA damage induced by mobile telephony and other types of man-made electromagnetic fields The number of studies showing adverse effects on living organisms induced by different types of man-made Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) has increased tremendously. Hundreds of peer reviewed published studies show a variety of effects, the most important being DNA damage which is linked to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, reproductive declines etc. Those studies that are far more effective in showing effects employ real-life Mobile Telephony (MT) exposures emitted by commercially available mobile phones. The present review - of results published by my group from 2006 until 2016 - compares DNA fragmentation induced by six different EMFs on the same biological system - the oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster - under identical conditions and procedures. Such a direct comparison between different EMFs - especially those employed in daily life - on the same biological endpoint, is very useful for drawing conclusions on their bioactivity, and novel. It shows that real MT EMFs are far more damaging than 50 Hz alternating magnetic field (MF) - similar or much stronger to those of power lines - or a pulsed electric field (PEF) found before to increase fertility. The MT EMFs were significantly more bioactive even for much shorter exposure durations than the other EMFs. Moreover, they were more damaging than previously tested cytotoxic agents like certain chemicals, starvation, dehydration. Individual parameters of the real MT EMFs like intensity, frequency, exposure duration, polarization, pulsing, modulation, are discussed in terms of their role in bioactivity. The crucial parameter for the intense bioactivity seems to be the extreme variability of the polarized MT signals, mainly due to the large unpredictable intensity changes.

2992,"Transmission of signals between irradiated and non-irradiated organisms: Mechanisms and significance Inter-animal signaling from irradiated to non-irradiated organisms has been demonstrated for whole body irradiated mice and also for fish. Endpoints studied include clastogenic damage, and reproductive cell death. For fish, proteomic data has also been produced showing the induction of a protective proteome in both medaka and rainbow trout. The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of medical microbeam irradiation using the ESRF synchrotron at Grenoble to the right brain hemisphere of the rat to determine whether abscopal effects could be produced in the rest of the animal and also in cage mates housed with it. The results show strong signal production in the contralateral brain hemisphere with less strong effects in the distant bladder of the irradiated rats. Signal strength was the same or stronger in the cage mates housed for 48 hrs with the irradiated rats. The proteomic study showed that the abscopal-associated proteins included A. an increase in the expression of NADH dehydrogenase, aconitase, ubiquinone and Glial fibrillary acid proteins, which are known to be present in gliomas, B. a reduction of the Prohibitin protein, which is thought to be a tumor suppressor in humans C. an increase on the expression of Heat shock cognate 71kDa protein, which is known to be involved in the disassembly of clarithin-coated vesicles and D. a decrease in the expression of Tubulin alpha-1A chain protein, which is known to be one of the major components of microtubules. All of these proteins would suggest a pro-carcinogenesis proteome. However in the cage mates, tubulin and aconitase were present but in different isoforms, HSP 71 was also induced. Significantly, pyruvate kinase, fructose biphosphate and aldolase were also present, suggesting mobilization of energy reserves. This also happened in the bystander fish. One brain specific protein which was suppressed in the cage mate brain is dihydropyrimidinase. This protein is prone to oxidation and the oxidised molecule is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A reduction could be seen as beneficial in terms of reducing the overall extent of oxidased dihydropyrimidinase. On the other hand dihydropyrimidinase is a vital neurotransmitter so a reduction could also be seen as detrimental to cognitive brain function. Whatever way the induced changes in the cage mates influence the health of the animals, it is very clear that proximity to an irradiated animal induces proteomic changes in an unirradiated partner. The transmitting agent in fish and rats is thought to be urine. If similar signaling occurs between humans, the results could have implications for caregivers and hospital staff treating radiotherapy patients.",Included
429,"Neurotransmitter receptors in brain regions of acrylamide-treated rats. II: Effects of extended exposure to acrylamide Acrylamide was administered orally to 6 week old male rats in ten doses, spread over a two week period. At the two lower doses (5 and 10 mg/kg, total dose 50 and 100 mg/kg) effects on neurotransmitter receptor sites appeared confirmed to the striatum where both the dopamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors exhibited enhanced binding twenty four hours after the last acrylamide dose. Other receptor sites within the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and medulla were not significantly altered. At the highest dose (20 mg/kg, given ten times), increases were also found for frontal cortical serotonin, medullary glycine, and cerebellar GABA receptor sites. The only unaffected receptor found was the cortical site for benzodiazepene. One week after the final acrylamide dose, the intensity of all ligands studied was not significantly different in treated and control groups. Thus, effects appeared reversible. Since striatal membrane protein concentration was reduced by treatment with rats with acrylamide, the observed increase in activity of muscarinic receptors could be best accounted for in terms of loss of striatal non-receptor protein rather than increased binding. However, the magnitude of increased striatal <sup>3</sup>H-spiroperidol binding in treated animals suggested an increase in overall binding capacity. An effect on dopamine neutrons was also suggested by a decreased responsiveness to apomorphine in rats treated with acrylamide at 10 mg/kg for 10 successive days; however, the effect had dissipated by 8 days after the final injection of acrylamide.",Excluded

The results of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from gynecologic cancer (ovarian, endometrial, and uterine cervical cancers) were retrospectively analyzed to identify the efficacy and prognostic factors for local tumor control and survival. Methods The medical records were retrospectively reviewed of 70 patients with 306 tumors who underwent GKS for brain metastases from gynecologic cancer between January 1995 and December 2013 in our institution. Results The primary cancers were ovarian in 33 patients with 147 tumors and uterine in 37 patients with 159 tumors. Median tumor volume was 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup>. Median marginal prescription dose was 20 Gy. The local tumor control rates were 96.4% at 6 months and 89.9% at 1 year. There was no statistically significant difference between ovarian and uterine cancers. Higher prescription dose and smaller tumor volume were significantly correlated with local tumor control. Median overall survival time was 8 months. Primary ovarian cancer, controlled extracranial metastases, and solitary brain metastasis were significantly correlated with satisfactory overall survival. Median activities of daily living (ADL) preservation survival time was 8 months. Primary ovarian cancer, controlled extracranial metastases, and higher Karnofsky Performance Status score were significantly correlated with better ADL preservation. Conclusions GKS is effective for control of tumor progression in patients with brain metastases from gynecologic cancer, and may provide neurologic benefits and preservation of the quality of life.

3135,"Nitric oxide as a mediator of parasympathetic vasodilation in ocular and extraocular tissues in the rabbit Purpose. The aim of this study was to investigate in rabbits the relationship between nitric oxide and the noncholinergic vasodilation caused by facial nerve stimulation in the eye and some extraocular tissues. Methods. Uveal vascular resistance was determined by measuring simultaneously the flow from a cannulated vortex vein with intraocular pressure and arterial blood pressure recordings. The local blood flow in different parts of the eye (iris, ciliary body, choroid, and retina), eyelids, nictitating membrane, Harderian gland, and lacrimal gland was determined using radioactive microspheres. The effects of facial nerve stimulation, at different frequencies, were examined before and alter the administration of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors. Results. In the experiments with direct determination of uveal blood flow, stimulation of the facial nerve caused a frequency-dependent decrease in uveal vascular resistance, indicating vasodilation. This effect was reduced or abolished by NOS inhibition at low frequencies but was unaffected at high frequencies. Determination of regional blood flow, with radioactive microspheres, showed that the stimulation increased local blood flow in all parts of the urea. Compared to the nonstimulated control side, stimulation at 2 Hz increased choroidal blood flow by 89% +/- 12% before NOS inhibition and by 45% +/- 10% after NOS inhibition, a difference of 44% +/- 77% (n = 9; P <= 0.05). Iris and ciliary body vasodilation appeared to be equally reduced. In eyelids, Harderian gland, and lacrimal gland, the vasodilation elicited by stimulation at 2 Hz was abolished almost completely by NOS inhibition. The vasodilation in most of the extraocular tissues was reduced significantly by NOS inhibition at 5 Hz, with only a slight reduction in the choroid, iris, and ciliary body. Retinal blood flow also was significantly increased by facial nerve stimulation at 2 Hz and 5 Hz. The increase in retinal blood flow appeared to be more sensitive to NOS inhibition than the increase in uveal blood flow. Conclusions. These results suggest that the formation of nitric oxide plays an important role in the uveal, retinal, and extraocular vasodilation brought about by facial nerve stimulation at low frequencies. At high frequencies, other neurotransmitters also seem to be involved.",Excluded
36,"Radiosurgical ablation of spinal cord AVM Objective: Intramedullary spinal cord arteriovenous malformations (AVMs ) are very rare lesions which are characteristically associated with recurrent hemorrhage and progressive ischemia. Although favorable location, size and vascular anatomy make it sometimes possible to manage this condition with embolization and/or microsurgical resection, there are no good treatment options for many, if not most, of these lesions. Given such poor prospects, the senior author began in 1997 investigating Cy-berKnife radiosurgical ablation as a tool for managing selected patients with intramedullary spinal cord AVMs. Although a previous paper in 2006 reported the preliminary experience from Stanford, our understanding has grown significantly as follow-up was extended and more patients were treated. Herein, we retrospectively analyze our longer term experience with a primary radiosurgical approach to spinal cord AVM. Method(s): Thirty patients (17 females: 13 males) with a median age of 33 years and intramedullary spinal cord AVMs (18 cervical, 9 thoracic, and three conus medullaris) were treated with CyberKnife SRS between 1997 and 2008. A history of hemorrhage was present in 57% of cases, while in 50% of patients previous treatment included microsurgery (6/29) or embolization (11/29). The mean AVM volume was 2.8 cc (0.2-15cc) was treated to mean marginal dose of 20Gy in one to four sessions (median 2). Based on our growing experience, the biologically effective dose (BED) of radiation was escalated gradually over the course of this study. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up were carried out annually, and spinal angiography was repeated at 3 years. Result(s): After a mean follow-up period of 63 months (median 54), the treated AVM was completely obliterated in 8 cases (27%) and significantly decreased in size in an additional 11 cases (64%) among the 22 angiographically studied patients with more than 3 years of follow-up. Pre-radiosurgery neurologic symptoms improved in more than 50% of cases, but worsened in three (10%). There was one instance (3%) of radiation-induced myelopathy occurring within one year of radiosurgery. Notably, after 158 years of collective post SRS follow-up, no patient suffered a hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): Although our understanding is still incomplete, CyberKnife radiosurgery Results in total obliteration or shrinkage for most intramedullary spinal cord AVM, a phenomenon that may beaccompanied by a marked decrease in the risk of bleeding. Symptom improvement is also common in most cases. More experience is required to determine the optimal radiosurgical dosing and consequent related efficacy. Given the significant therapeutic challenges inherent to spinal cord AVM patients, the rate of radiosurgical complications appears acceptable.",Excluded
1410,"Examining safety and efficacy of radiosurgery concurrent with checkpoint inhibition for melanoma brain metastases: A prospective registry study Purpose/Objective(s): Immune check-point inhibition with CTLA-4 or PD-1 blockade has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma. This study investigated safety and efficacy associated with check-point inhibitors (CPIs) concurrent with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) in melanoma patients with brain metastases. Materials/Methods: Prospectively collected data were analyzed from an IRB-approved registry of 428 patients with 2830 brain metastases treated with SRS from 2012-2015. Melanoma patients treated with SRS within 1 month of administration of a CPI were identified as being treated concurrently. Patients treated concurrently were matched 1:1 with a control group of melanoma patients treated with SRS alone. All patients had preand post-SRS T1-and T2-weighted MRIs. Categorical variables were compared with Fisher's exact tests, continuous variables with independent sample t-tests, and the log-rank test was used for survival and disease control analyses. Statistical tests were two-tailed, with the significance level set at a<0.05. Result(s): Twenty one melanoma patients with 104 brain metastases were treated concurrently with GKRS and a CPI. Ten patients were treated with Ipilimumab, ten with Pembrolizumab, and one with Nivolumab. Matched patients had no statistically significant differences in age, gender, performance status, extracranial disease burden, prior radiation, peri-SRS steroid use, number of brain lesions or total brain tumor volume treated. Patients treated with concurrent CPIs and SRS were significantly more likely to have any post-treatment increases in T1 post-contrast and T2-FLAIR volumes (52 vs 19%; P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in rates of adverse radiation effects, steroid use at follow-up, or decompressive craniotomies. There were also no significant differences in local control, distant brain failure, or rates of salvage whole brain radiation or SRS. There was a non-significant improvement in median overall survival (OS) with concurrent CPIs compared with matched controls (11.6 vs 8.8 months, P = 0.80) and a significantly longer median OS than predicted by Diagnosis-Specific GPA (DS-GPA) scores (11.6 vs 4.7 months, P = 0.05).1 Median OS for matched controls was not significantly different than that predicted by their DS-GPA scores. Conclusion(s): Melanoma patients with brain metastases treated concurrently with SRS and CPIs are more likely than patients treated with SRS alone to demonstrate imaging changes without apparent clinical consequences. No differences in disease outcomes were found based on CPI use, however median OS was better than predicted for patients treated concurrently with SRS and CPIs.",Excluded
2118,"Gliosarcoma in the IDH era: Imaging characteristics of 25 patients with correlative immunostaining Background: In the 2016 World Health Organizations Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, gliosarcoma (GSC) is considered a variant of IDH-wild type glioblastoma (GBM) characterized by a biphasic pattern with alternating areas exhibiting glial and mesenchymal differentiation. GSC can be primary or radiation-induced and is an intra-axial brain lesion which often abuts a dural surface. While some GSC have indistinguishable imaging characteristics from glioblastoma, aggressive lesions can erode through the dura and skull and involve the extra-cranial soft tissues. We present the largest known imaging series of GSC with immunohistochemical and histologic correlation, documenting them as IDH(-) and delineating their imaging spectrum. Method(s): Pathology proved GSC cases were collected from our quaternary care center spanning the last 16 years. IDH status was either documented or obtained by staining tissue blocks. When available, p53, PTEN, MIB-1, EGFR amplification status, and MGMT methylation status were recorded and imaging findings tabulated. Result(s): 25 cases were identified, 21 were De novo, and 4 were radiation-induced. All lesions contacted a dural or pial surface. All cases were negative for an IDH R132H mutation, including post-radiation GSC. 16/16 cases showed non-amplification of EGFR/CEP7. MGMT methylation was present in 2/17. Imaging features included areas of nodular thickening in necrotic lesions which appeared to abut the site of pial or dural contact.

666,"Model making of radioactive optic nerve injury. [Chinese] Background: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a severe complication after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, which threatens the visual acuity and quality of life of patients. Till now, there is no recognized treatment for RION. It is of great significance to study the natural progression of the RION, and to prevent and treat RION. Objective(s): This study was to establish an ideal radioactive optic nerve injury animal model. Method(s): Healthy 8-week SD rats with hygiene grade were randomly divided into normal control group and model group, with 6 rats in each group. The total 30 Gy dose of radiation with 3 portions was used to irradiate the head model group rats; ELISA was performed to analysis the changes of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and Von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentrations in blood 2, 4 and 8 weeks after irradiation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscope were performed to observe the changes of optic structure. The use and care of the experimental animals complied with the ARVO statement. Result(s): The concentrations of ET-1 in the model group were (23.18 +/- 0.11), (27.98 +/- 0.22), (33.90 +/- 0.11), (65.25 +/- 0.38) and (43.82 +/- 0.09) pg/ml before irradiation, 1 day, 2, 4, 6 weeks after irradiation, those in the normal control group were (22.65 +/- 0.14), (23.18 +/- 0.19), (23.68 +/- 0.15), (24.23 +/- 0.12) and (23.58 +/- 0.16) pg/ml. The concentrations of vWF in the model group were (63.16 +/- 2.21), (88.32 +/- 2.06), (123.38 +/- 1.36), (191.40 +/- 0.61) and (141.69 +/- 0.82) pg/ml before irradiation, 1 day, 2, 4, 6 weeks after irradiation, those in the normal control group were (62.82 +/- 1.56), (63.35 +/- 2.06), (64.12 +/- 1.76), (63.52 +/- 2.02) and (63.48 +/- 1.55)pg/ml. There were significant differences of ET-1 and vWF concentrations among different groups and time points (ET-1: F<inf>group</inf>=32.160, P=0.012 ; F<inf>time</inf>=21.180, P=0.023.vWF: F<inf>group</inf>=73.110, P=0.001; F<inf>time</inf>=46.180, P=0.002). The nerve fiber bundles was swelled with disordered arrangement and vacuolization 8 weeks after irradiation. Axon swell and atrophy, axons with myelin sheath layer plate separation were obtained. The rates of axon demyelination in the normal control group and model group were (1.35 +/- 0.79)% and (14.44 +/- 2.32)%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (t=14.07, P<0.01).

Pineal gland NAT activity declined linearly in albino rats exposed to different irradiances of a 460 or 580 nm monochromatic light during the middle of the dark phase of the cycle. The difference in sensitivity to the test lights is that predicted for a photopigment having peak absorbance at 495 nm, suggesting the inhibition of pineal gland N-acetyltransferase activity is mediated by the photopigment found in rat rods.",Excluded

Cancer survivors were also compared on the basis of treatment intervention, involving chemotherapy (n = 27) versus local therapy through surgery and radiation (n = 30).RESULTS: As a group, the breast cancer survivors scored lower on measures of general cognitive function, working memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function when compared with the normal comparisons. Among the cancer survivors, those who received local therapy scored lower than the other survivors and normal comparisons on measures of verbal learning, visual perception and construction, as well as visual attention and short-term retention.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cognitive outcomes may involve greater age-related deficits among older cancer survivors compared with matched healthy subjects.",Included
1860,"Evaluation of results of linac-based radiosurgery for brain metastases from primary lung cancer Aim: The purpose of our review was to evaluate results of radiosurgery for patients with brain metastases from lung cancer. Background(s): Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer and the most common source of brain metastases. Radiosurgery allows the precise focal delivery of a high single radiation dose to brain metastases and results in high rates of local control. Material(s) and Method(s): 83 patients were treated between 2006 and 2008. We evaluated local control and outcome after radiosurgery and identified prognostic factors. Result(s): Median survival in the whole group was 7.8 months from radiosurgery and 11 months from diagnosis. Median survival in classes I, II and III was 13.2, 8.2 and 2.2 months. For 94% of patients symptoms improved or stabilised at the first follow-up visit and this status did not change during 7.1 months. According to the univariate analysis, factors associated with improved survival included: RPA class 1 compared with RPA 2 and 3, RPA class 2 compared with RPA 3, KPS>70, control of the primary disease, radiosurgery performed more than once, level of haemoglobin >7mmol/1, absence of extracranial metastases, volume of the biggest lesion <11cm<sup>3</sup>. The multivariate analysis confirmed a significant influence on survival for the following factors: RPA class 1 as compared with RPA 3, KPS>70, absence of extracranial metastases, multiplicity of radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment. It proved to be effective and safe in older patients. Selection of patients who are likely to benefit most should be based on prognostic factors. KPS proved to be the most important prognostic factor.

3405,"Light-induced Egr-1 expression in the striate cortex of the opossum In the present study, immunocytochemistry was used to assess the expression of Egr-1 nuclear protein across selected regions of the opossum visual system. In light-deprived (LD) animals, only a few scattered cell nuclei were found throughout the striate cortex (V1). Exposure to light promoted a significant increase in the density of Egr-1 labeled nuclei in V1. Laminar distribution of immunoreactive nuclei in light-stimulated animals (LS) tended to vary with topography: the lateral region, which corresponds to the central representation of the visual field, appeared to have higher density of cells expressing protein in the supragranular layers, as compared to the medial region, which corresponds to the representation of the peripheral field of vision. Finally, LS animals displayed a narrow band of labeled cell nuclei in the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and throughout the anteroposterior extent of the superior colliculus (SC). In contrast, almost no Egr-1 immunolabeling was found in the IGL and SC of LD animals. Our report is the first demonstration of light-regulated expression of the Egr-1 gene in the opossum visual system and provides evidence that the expression of an activity-dependent gene related to neural plasticity is evolutionarily conserved in the visual cortex of the mammalian lineage.",Excluded

We aimed to identify patients' characteristics and operative factors predictive of early (<= 30-day) and late (<= 6-month) morbidity in cervical cancer patients undergoing surgery plus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).METHODS: We studied 45 propensity-matched patient pairs (90 patients) undergoing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (LRH) plus EBRT vs. abdominal radical hysterectomy (RAH) plus EBRT. Basic descriptive, multivariable and artificial neuronal network analyses (ANN) were used to design predicting models influencing outcomes.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the study populations were similar. Patients undergoing LRH experienced lower blood loss (200 (range, 10-700) vs. 400 (range, 100-2000) ml; P < 0.001), shorter length of hospital stay (4 (range, 1-10) vs. 8 (range, 5-52) days; P < 0.001) and similar operative time (235 (+/- 67.3) vs. 258 (+/- 70.2) min; P = 0.14) than patients undergoing RAH. We observed that, at multivariate analysis, open approach correlated with overall (OR: 1.2; 95%CI: 1.03-1.46), early (OR: 1.14; 95%CI:0.99-1.3) and late (OR: 1.13; 95%CI: 1.001-1.28) postoperative complications.CONCLUSIONS: Open approach is the main predictor for developing morbidity among cervical cancer patients undergoing radical hysterectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy.

3498,"Intracellular analysis of reflex pathways underlying the stumbling corrective reaction during fictive locomotion in the cat In cat and humans, contact between an obstacle and the dorsum of the foot evokes the stumbling corrective reaction (reflex) that lifts the foot to avoid falling. This reflex can also be evoked by short trains of stimuli to the cutaneous superficial peroneal (SP) nerve in decerebrate cats during the flexion phase of fictive locomotion. Here we examine intracellular events in hindlimb motoneurons accompanying stumbling correction. SP stimulation delivered during the flexion phase excites knee flexor motoneurons at short latency [minimum excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) latency 1.8 ms; mean 2.7 ms]. Although a similar short latency excitation occurs in ankle extensors (mean latency, 2.8 ms), recruitment is delayed until successive shocks in the stimulus train overcome the locomotor-related hyperpolarization of ankle extensors. In ankle flexor motoneurons, SP stimulation evokes an inhibition (mean latency, 2.7 ms) that briefly reduces or stops their firing during the flexion phase. There is a phase-dependent modulation of SP-evoked EPSP amplitude as well as latency during locomotion. However, the more obvious change in SP reflex pathways with the onset of fictive locomotion is the reduced inhibition of ankle extensor motoneurons and the increased inhibition of ankle flexors. These results show that the characteristic pattern of hindlimb motoneuron activation during SP nerve-evoked stumbling correction results from 1) di- and trisynaptic excitation of knee flexor and ankle extensor motoneurons; 2) increased inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in ankle flexors and a suppression of inhibition in extensors, 3) sculpting of the short-latency SP postsynaptic effects by motoneuron membrane potential, and 4) longer latency excitatory effects that are likely evoked by lumbar interneurons involved in the generation of fictive locomotion.",Excluded
2727,"Cranial nerve preservation and outcomes after stereotactic radiosurgery for jugular foramen schwannomas OBJECTIVE: Jugular foramen region schwannomas are rare intracranial tumors that usually present with multiple lower cranial nerve deficits. For some patients, complete surgical resection is possible but may be associated with significant morbidity. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a minimally invasive alternative or adjunct to microsurgery for such tumors. We reviewed our clinical and imaging outcomes after patients underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for management of jugular foramen schwannomas.METHODS: Thirty-four patients with 35 tumors (one patient had bilateral tumors) underwent radiosurgery between May 1990 and December 2005. Twenty-two patients had previous microsurgical resection and all patients experienced various cranial neuropathies. A median of six isocenters were used. Median marginal and maximum doses were 14 and 28 Gy, respectively.RESULTS: None of the patients were lost to evaluation and the mean duration of follow-up was 83 months. Tumors regressed in 17 patients, remained stable in 16, and progressed in two. Five- and 10-year actuarial control rates were 97 and 94%, respectively. Preexisting cranial neuropathies improved in 20% and remained stable in 77% after radiosurgery. One patient worsened. The function of all previous intact nerves was preserved after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery proved to be a safe and effective management for newly diagnosed or residual jugular foramen schwannomas.

Participants were stratified by stage (IIIA v IIIB), histology (nonsquamous v squamous), and therapy (surgery v none) and were randomly assigned to PCI or observation. PCI was delivered to 30 Gy in 15 fractions. The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS), neurocognitive function (NCF), and quality of life. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses were used for OS and DFS. The incidence of brain metastasis (BM) was evaluated with the logistic regression model.RESULTS: Overall, 356 patients were accrued of the targeted 1,058. The study was closed early because of slow accrual; 340 of the 356 patients were eligible. The 1-year OS (P = .86; 75.6% v 76.9% for PCI v observation) and 1-year DFS (P = .11; 56.4% v 51.2% for PCI v observation) were not significantly different. The hazard ratio for observation versus PCI was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.36). The 1-year rates of BM were significantly different (P = .004; 7.7% v 18.0% for PCI v observation). Patients in the observation arm were 2.52 times more likely to develop BM than those in the PCI arm (unadjusted odds ratio, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.32 to 4.80).CONCLUSION: In patients with stage III disease without progression of disease after therapy, PCI decreased the rate of BM but did not improve OS or DFS.",Included

PURPOSE: To clarify the tumor control and complications of salvage craniospinal irradiation (CSI) for recurrent germinoma. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the medical record. Among 153 germinomas treated in Tohoku University Hospital since 1983, 22 had recurrence of germinoma. At first recurrence, 7 cases received CSI, whereas 15 cases did chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy other than craniospinal field (non- CSI). CSI was performed at 24 Gy/ 12 fractions or 30 Gy/ 25 fractions. RESULT(S): CSI had statistically significant better recurrence-free survival rate after recurrence than non-CSI (100% vs 33%, p<0.001: log-rank test). In addition, tumor control was obtained in all of four cases with the failure after non- CSI treatments for recurrence. The late complications of these 11 cases were examined. The local dose before CSI was 24- 50 Gy, and the median interval from last irradiation to CSI was 33 months. Median follow- up period after CSI was 126 months. Three patients developed newly developed visual or cognitive deficits. These patients received high-dose irradiation at initial treatment or multiple treatment before CSI. There were no late complications in the cases which had prior chemotherapy and 24 Gy of irradiation to whole ventricle only before CSI.

495,"Hairy and emc negatively regulate morphogenetic furrow progression in the Drosophila eye The initial steps of pattern formation in the developing Drosophila eye involve the coordination of cell cycles, changes in cell shape, and the specification of the R8 photoreceptor cell.

Two HLH regulatory proteins that function to suppress neuronal development in other tissues, extra macrochaetae (emc) and hairy (h), are expressed ahead of the morphogenetic furrow. While neither h nor emc is required for photoreceptor cell determination, in emc-h-clones the morphogenetic furrow and differentiated eye field advance up to eight ommatidial rows ahead of adjacent wild-type tissue. This indicates that morphogenetic furrow progression and neuronal differentiation are negatively regulated by a combination of anteriorly expressed HLH regulatory proteins.",Excluded

We present a case report of a 74-year-oldwoman originally referred to neurology with a 5 month history of pain on the right side of her chin, associated with a sensation of sunburn and a 'feeling of a clumsy tongue'. She had no history of radiation exposure and did not smoke.

A subsequent CT Neck and Ultrasound demonstrated a lesion within the right sublingual space, which was biopsied and shown to be an adenoid cystic carcinoma. A radical resection of the lesion was performed, resecting from the floor of mouth and base of tongue, with a right-sided selective neck dissection, approached via mandibulotomy. The procedure also involved the formation of a tracheostomy and reconstruction with a free radial forearm flap to the floor of her mouth.

48,"Incidence of intracranial radiation necrosis following postoperative radiation therapy for sinonasal malignancies OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Surgery and postoperative radiation therapy are commonly used in the treatment of advanced sinonasal cancer. However, post-treatment radiation changes to the brain often mimic radiologic findings suggestive of tumor recurrence, leading to potential unnecessary intracranial biopsies. The objective of this study was to determine clinical factors that predict signs of tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis in post-therapy sinonasal malignancies with intracranial extension.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.METHODS: Twenty-six patients with sinonasal malignancy with intracranial extension underwent surgery and radiation +/- chemotherapy between 2010 and 2014 at the University of Arizona. We analyzed sinonasal cancer type, stage, total radiation dosimetry, time until imaging changes, surgical pathology, associated imaging, and patient demographics.RESULTS: Thirteen of 26 patients had postoperative imaging changes seen on surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Five were deemed to have tumor recurrence due to new metastasis seen on positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan. Four patients were observed with serial imaging that confirmed pseudoprogression. In four patients, there was sufficient concern due to persistent MRI changes, which prompted surgical biopsy, and only one of them was positive for tumor recurrence. Factors that favored tumor recurrence included faster onset of imaging changes on MRI (55 vs. 186 days, P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial tumor recurrence can be difficult to distinguish between radiation necrosis in sinonasal cancers treated with surgery and postoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy. Patients with sub-total resection and rapid onset of MRI changes in postsurveillance scans are more likely to have tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis. Future imaging techniques or tests that investigate tumor biomarkers are necessary to prevent unnecessary biopsies.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 126:2445-2450, 2016.",Excluded

CNS metastases have been managed with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and concomitant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Our previous study did not observe serious CNS toxicity (Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1991;22:17-22). We now report on 5 patients who developed delayed significant CNS toxicity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We observed 5 patients with delayed CNS toxicity. The initial diagnosis was between 1981 and 2003. All patients had poor-risk disease according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Collaborative Group criteria. Of the 5 patients, 3 had CNS metastases at diagnosis and 2 developed relapses with CNS metastases. These 5 patients underwent WBRT to 4,000-5,000 cGy in 18-28 fractions concurrently with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.RESULTS: All 5 patients developed delayed symptoms consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The symptoms included seizures, hemiparesis, cranial neuropathy, headaches, blindness, dementia, and ataxia. The median time from WBRT to CNS symptoms was 72 months (range, 9-228). Head imaging revealed multiple abnormalities consistent with gliosis and diffuse cerebral atrophy. Of the 5 patients, 3 had progressive and 2 stable symptoms. Treatment with surgery and/or steroids had modest benefit.

1377,"Frequent occurrence of therapeutically reversible CMV-associated encephalopathy during radiotherapy of the brain BACKGROUND: Neurological decline during radio(chemo)therapy of the brain is often attributed to disease progression or side effects of radiotherapy. Diagnosis of opportunistic neurotropic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections is uncommon, even though high-grade gliomas and some brain metastases are known to contain CMV particles. We prospectively examined the frequency of CMV encephalopathy during radiotherapy of the brain.METHODS: Fifty patients requiring whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases (n = 27) or local radio(chemo)therapy of the brain for high-grade gliomas (n = 23) were observed in the prospective observational GLIO-CMV-01 study. MRIs and blood samples were obtained before, halfway through, and at the end of radiotherapy. MRIs were screened for disease progression or increased intracranial pressure. Blood was tested for anti-CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)M, anti-CMV IgG, and CMV DNA.RESULTS: Thirty-two of 50 (64%) patients were positive for anti-CMV IgG before radio(chemo)therapy. Fifteen of those 32 (48%) developed viremia during or up to 28 days after treatment. Thirteen of those 15 (87%) required treatment for CMV-associated encephalopathy. MRIs were negative for disease progression, edema, or bleeding. None of the patients negative for anti-CMV IgG developed viremia, suggesting a reactivation rather than a primary infection. In the group at risk consisting of anti-CMV IgG+ patients, age >65 (P = .004) and the amount of dexamethasone taken during radio(chemo)therapy (P = .004) were associated with an increased risk for CMV-associated encephalopathy. One hundred and fifty days after the start of radio(chemo)therapy, survival was 74% (14/19) (no encephalopathy) versus 54% (7/13) (encephalopathy) (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.03-1.86; P = .25).CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation frequently causes encephalopathy during radio(chemo)therapy of the brain.

This study was undertaken to assess the acute effects of low doses of radiation on cognitive functions, serum cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status, 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice received either sham treatment or irradiation (0.5, 1 and 3 Gy) and were tested for the alterations in the normal behaviour within 10 days. And a blood Serotonin and cortisol analysis was carried out using ELISA kits. Results obtained were analysed using one-way ANOVA. There was a significant decline in exploratory activity of mice exposed to 3 Gy and 1 Gy radiation in open field test. We observed a significant decline in spontaneous Percent Alternation indicating the short-term memory loss in 3 Gy and 1 Gy irradiated mice in Y-Maze. 1 and 3 Gy irradiated mice exhibited increased anxiety in EPM. The increased anxiety and memory loss patterns were also seen in 0.5 Gy irradiated mice, but the results were statistically not significant. The changes to cortisol level were in a dose dependent manner and serotonin levels decreased with dose. Total antioxidant levels also showed the decreasing trend with respect to radiation doses, this pattern is similar to the pattern of cognitive decline shown in behaviour analysis suggesting that the antioxidant status maybe co-related to the radiation induced cognitive decline.

747,"Does the robotic platform reduce the morbidity associated with combined radical surgery and adjuvant radiation for early cervical cancer? Objectives: Open radical hysterectomy (RH) followed by adjuvant radiation (XRT) for cervical cancer has been associated with high morbidity; however, RHs are now often performed robotically. We examined if the robotic platform decreases the morbidity associated with radical surgery followed by adjuvant XRT. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of patients with cervical cancer undergoing RH from 1995-2013 was performed. Clinical and pathologic data were obtained from the medical record. Long-term (LT) complications were defined as urinary and/or bowel complications, and lymphedema presenting more than 30 days after completion of therapy. Complications were graded. Grade 1 was mild symptoms and easily treated. Grade 2 was symptoms resolving with long-term medical therapy. Grade 3 was major symptoms requiring surgery or invasive procedures. The X<sup>2</sup> and student t tests were used for analysis. Result(s): Overall, 243 patients underwent RH for cervical cancer. The open surgical approach was used in 43% (n = 104) and the robotic approach was used in 57% (n = 139). Eighty-three patients (34.2%) required adjuvant XRT. XRT was associated with increased risk of LT complication (28.9% vs 7.0% P <.001). LT complications included lymphedema (n = 18), bowel-associated complications (enteritis/proctitis n = 8, obstruction n = 2), and urinary complications (hemorrhagic cystitis n = 1, neurogenic bladder n = 2, fistula n = 1, and ureteral stricture n = 3). Among patients who received adjuvant XRT, the open surgical approach was used in 48% (n = 40) and the robotic approach in 52% (n = 43). There was no difference in time to initiation of XRT between the 2 surgical groups (43.2 +/- 15.6 vs 47.3 +/- 19.6 days, P =.33). There was no difference in grade 2/3 LT complications in patients receiving adjuvant XRT between the groups (27.5% vs 27.9%, P =.97). However, patients undergoing open surgery experienced a trend toward increased adhesion-related complications, such as bowel obstruction and ureteral stricture (10% vs 2.3%, P =.19). Conclusion(s): We found no difference in LT complications between patients who underwent robotic and those who underwent open RH and adjuvant XRT. Fewer adhesion-related LT complications may be seen with robotic surgery. However, because many XRT-related complications occur at later time points, continued follow-up is needed to evaluate for potential differences between the 2 groups.",Included
485,"Impaired Attentional Set-Shifting Performance after Exposure to 5 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si Particles Astronauts on deep space missions will be required to work more autonomously than on previous missions, and thus their ability to perform executive functions could be critical to mission success. One of the most common measures of executive function in humans is the ability to perform attentional set shifting, which requires contributions from working memory, discrimination, reversal learning, attentional set shifting and attention. Rodent attentional set shifting assays require rats to form an association between the presence of the food reward and an associative cue, which is either the digging media or the scent that is placed in the bowl; by altering the combination of scent and digging media, progressively more complex cognitive processes can be tested. In this study, we have determined the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si particles has on the ability of male retired breeder Wistar rats to perform attentional set shifting at three months postirradiation. All doses of Si resulted in a significant impairment in the ability of the rats to perform the first and most simple step of the ATSET assay, the simple discrimination (SD) task. If astronauts were to experience HZE-induced SD impairments, they would be unable to identify key factors to successfully resolve a situation. Performance in at least one other component of the ATSET test was impaired at all doses studied, however, these varied according to the dose. Compared with our previous studies using 1 GeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe and <sup>48</sup>Ti particles, 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si ions impaired attentional set-shifting performance at lower doses than the heavier ions. However, when the effect of isofluences of the three HZE ions were compared, there were no significant differences in the severity of the impaired performance; there were, however, ion-specific decrements in the ability of rats to perform within the various stages of the test. This study further supports the notion that ""mission-relevant"" doses of HZE particles (<20 cGy) can impair certain aspects of attentional set-shifting performance in retired breeder rats, but there may be some ion-specific changes in the specific cognitive domains impaired.",Included
2220,"Chronic Low Dose Neutron Exposure Results in Altered Neurotransmission Properties of the Hippocampus-Prefrontal Cortex Axis in Both Mice and Rats The proposed deep space exploration to the moon and later to Mars will result in astronauts receiving significant chronic exposures to space radiation (SR). SR exposure results in multiple neurocognitive impairments. Recently, our cross-species (mouse/rat) studies reported impaired associative memory formation in both species following a chronic 6-month low dose exposure to a mixed field of neutrons (1 mGy/day for a total dose pf 18 cGy). In the present study, we report neutron exposure induced synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex, accompanied by microglial activation and significant synaptic loss in the hippocampus. In a parallel study, neutron exposure was also found to alter fluorescence assisted single synaptosome LTP (FASS-LTP) in the hippocampus of rats, that may be related to a reduced ability to insert AMPAR into the post-synaptic membrane, which may arise from increased phosphorylation of the serine 845 residue of the GluA1 subunit. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time, that low dose chronic neutron irradiation impacts homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-cortical circuit in two rodent species, and that the ability to successfully encode associative recognition memory is a dynamic, multicircuit process, possibly involving compensatory changes in AMPAR density on the synaptic surface.",Included

Diagnosis of cardiovascular disease(CVD) and type II diabetes mellitus (TIIDM) was established in accordance with diagnostic standards adopted inUkraine. All study subjects had no signs of CVD, and neither of endocrine disease nor of metabolic disorders beforethe accident.RESULTS: Clinical course of the TIIDM, depending on the disease severity, onset of angiopathy and polyneuropathy,prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure were surveyed and analyzed. Concomitant TIIDM was associated witha higher incidence of angina pectoris and heart failure. According to the Kaplan-Meier method of survival estimatingthe accumulation of new TIIDM cases occurred faster in the ACUW compared with individuals in the CG, however withno statistical significance in subjects aged up to 60 years old (log-rank test chi2 = 4.89, p = 0.027). Mean age of theACUW having comorbid CVD and DM was (54.6 +/- 9.7) years, whilst in the CG it was (59.9 +/- 10.7) years (p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: The DM course in the ACUW was not significantly different from non-irradiated control both in sever-ity and such complications as angiopathy of retina and lower extremities, as well as manifestations of lower extrem-ity polyneuropathy. Clinical manifestations of CVD in the form of angina pectoris and heart failure were identical inthe ACUW and control group of patients having a comorbid TIIDM. The latter was a factor exacerbating the CVDcourse and leading to a higher prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure both in the ACUW and in non-irritat-ed individuals. Accumulation of the new DM cases occurred more rapidly in ACUW vs. non-irradiated control, so theywere in average 5 years younger at the time of TIIDM manifestation than the control subjects.",Included
33,"Variation in radiation sensitivity and repair kinetics in different parts of the spinal cord BACKGROUND: The spinal cord, known for its strongly serial character and high sensitivity to radiation even when a small segment is irradiated, is one of the most critical organs at risk to be spared during radiation therapy. To compare the sensitivity of different parts of the spinal cord, data for radiation myelopathy have been used.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, the relative seriality model was fitted to two different datasets of clinical radiation myelitis concerning cervical spinal cord after treating 248 patients for head and neck cancer and thoracic spinal cord after treating 43 patients with lung carcinoma. The maximum likelihood method was applied to fit the clinical data. The model parameters and their 68% confidence intervals were calculated for each dataset. The alpha/beta ratio for the thoracic cord was also was also found to be 0.9 (0-3.0) Gy.RESULTS: The dose-response curve for the more sensitive cervical myelopathy is well described by the parameters D(50)=55.9 (54.8-57.1) Gy, gamma=6.9 (5.0-9.2), s=0.13 (0.07-0.24), whereas the thoracic myelopathy is described by the parameters D(50)=75.5 (70.5-80.8) Gy, gamma=1.1 (0.6-1.6), s=36 (3.3-infinity).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in radiation response between the cervical and thoracic region of spinal cord are thus observed: cervical myelopathy seems to be characterized by medium seriality, while thoracic spinal cord is characterized by a highly serial dose-response. The much steeper dose-response curve for cervical spinal cord myelopathy can be interpreted as a higher number of functional subunits consistent with a higher amount of white matter close to the brain.",Excluded
2916,"The effects of the g-quadruplex ligand telomestatin to human brain tumor stem cell survival and growth Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the leading cause of death among primary brain tumors in adults and the current therapies have only palliative effect on prognosis of patients. Recently, stem cell-like cells in GBM (brain tumor stem-like cells; BTSC) have gained substantial attention as a potential therapeutic target. Hallmarks of BTSC include their self-renewal capacity and highly migratory potential. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of patient-derived BTSC with a G-quadruplex ligand, telomestatin (TMS), inhibits BTSC self-renewal and maintenance of their stem cell state, and induces their apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, both normal precursors and non-stem tumor cells from the matched samples are relatively resistant to TMS treatment. Treatment with a lower dose of TMS specifically inhibits BTSC migration into normal brain. Immunofluorescence in situ hybridization with TMS-treated GBM cells displays both telomeric and non-telomeric DNA damage in BTSC but not in non-stem tumor cells. cDNA microarray analysis identifies a proto-oncogene, c-Myb, as a target of TMS in BTSC, and the pharmacodynamic analysis with TMS-treated tumor-bearing mouse brains demonstrates reduction of c-Myb expression in tumors. An elevated c-Myb expression is found in surgical specimens of GBM compared to normal brain tissues. Lastly, TMS treatment of BTSC-derived mouse intracranial tumors reduces tumor sizes in vivo without any noticeable apoptotic cells in the normal brain, and a combined treatment of TMS with radiation or temozolomide results in additive inhibitory effects on GBM sphere growth in vitro. Collectively, these data indicate a potential avenue toward BTSC-directed therapeutic strategy using TMS via telomeric DNA damage and inhibition of c-Myb, which may offer a novel therapeutic approach for GBM.",Excluded
1326,"Relationship between acoustic pressure used for BBB disruption and amount of MRI contrast agent delivered to the brain Objectives: The acoustic intensity needs to be very well known to efficiently open the Blood-brain Barrier (BBB) since it is mainly ruled by the mechanical index [1]. Previous studies have shown that a narrow range of peak negative pressure (PNP) is acceptable, corresponding to sufficient stable cavitation of injected microbubbles without reaching inertial cavitation responsible for irreversible damages. Within this range, only few data are available about how the pressure affects the strength of BBB disruption that is to say the amount of delivered drugs. We propose two new methods to evidence the opening threshold in vivo and measure this relationship after a MRI controlled protocol of the BBB opening: 1) Several different pressures are used at several brain locations during the same BBB opening session 2) A single point focal opening is performed and the brain uptake of contrast agent is correlated in each voxel with the pressure estimated from a MR-acoustic radiation force image [2]. Methods We use our previously introduced motorized MR-compatible FUS sys-tem [3] (Image Guided Therapy, France). An 8 channel annular array transducer operating at 1.5MHz (Imasonic, France) was calibrated in a water tank and acoustic transmission factors through rat skulls were measured in another study. This ability to shrewdly control the pressure we deliver in vivo in the brain is crucial for the two proposed methods. Fisher F344 rats (n=5, body weight=220g) were shaved and installed in the MRI bed of a 7T MRI scanner (Bruker) under isoflurane anesthesia. The transducer was coupled to the head with echographic gel. In a first experiment, after intravenous injection of microbubbles (Sonovue), a square trajectory was played with the transducer continuously shooting. 4 different pressures (0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 MPa) were applied on the 4 sides of the square. The transducer was moving at 10 mm/s, the size of the square was 5 mm and the trajectory was played 60 times. Then a 200muL Gadolinium based MRI contrast agent (Dotarem, Guerbet, France) was intravenously injected, at different time after the opening (10 minutes, 4 hours and 24 hours), and its uptake into the brain was quantitatively measured thank to T<inf>1</inf> maps. In a second experiment, the BBB was focally open with 0.6 MPa peak negative pressure at focus. Before the opening session, an Acoustic Radiation Force Image was acquired in order to estimate in vivo the pressure applied in each voxel during the BBB opening. After the opening, Dotarem was intravenously injected and the contrast agent concentration was measured in each voxel by acquiring T<inf>1</inf> maps [4]. The concentration in each voxel is then correlated to the pressure which has been used in this voxel to open the BBB. Results The first experiment with the square trajectory gives a rough estimation of the pressure threshold. Indeed it appears clearly (see Fig. 130) that the BBB is not open on the 0.25 and 0.35 MPa sides while it is open on the 0.45 and 0.55 MPa sides. The acoustic threshold must be between 0.35 and 0.45 MPa. With the second injection, we also found that the BBB was already close as soon as 4 hours after the opening even for the 0.55 MPa region. The second experiment gives a more accurate estimation of the pressure threshold. By plotting the concentrations in contrast agent in the voxel versus the pressure used in these voxel to open the BBB (see Fig. 131), two trends are observables. In a first pressure range, from 0 to 0.4 MPa, the pressure is not sufficient to open the BBB so the concentration is not significant. In a higher pressure range, from 0.4 MPa to 0.6MPa, the pressure is sufficient to open the BBB and the concentration increases as the pressure increases in a roughly linear way. With this experiment the found pressure threshold is about 0.4 MPa. A third way of determining the opening threshold is to study the width of the opening on the sides [LB1] of the square of the first ex-periment. Indeed it is possible to plot the concentration profile across the lines of the opening and t compare it to the Gaussian profile of the pressure which has been studied in water tank. It appeared that the width where the BBB is open matches with the width on the Gaussian profile where the pressure is higher than 0.4 MPa. Conclusions The two different methods proposed for the study of the dependency of drug uptake after BBB disruption with acoustic pressure give consistent results. We find an acoustic pressure threshold for the BBB opening of 0.4 MPa, for a 1.5 MHz working frequency. This result is in good accordance with the literature [5]. By acquiring T2 weighted images after those experiments, we are confident we caused no damages up to 0.6 MPa. This pressure is close to the one for which adverse effects started to appear in our previous studies thought. As a consequence, the pressure window for a safe and efficient BBB opening is quite narrow which highlights that the pressure in vivo has to be very well controlled. [LB1] Above the opening threshold, the relationship between drug uptake and acoustic pressure is linear. The knowledge of this relationship is key in order to predict drug pharmacokinetics after BBB disruption.",Excluded

2100,"Association of Radioactive Iodine Treatment with Cancer Mortality in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Importance: Radioactive iodine (RAI) has been used extensively to treat hyperthyroidism since the 1940s. Although widely considered a safe and effective therapy, RAI has been associated with elevated risks of total and site-specific cancer death among patients with hyperthyroidism. Objective(s): To determine whether greater organ- or tissue-absorbed doses from RAI treatment are associated with overall and site-specific cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study is a 24-year extension of the multicenter Cooperative Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Follow-up Study, which has followed up US and UK patients diagnosed and treated for hyperthyroidism for nearly 7 decades, beginning in 1946. Patients were traced using records from the National Death Index, Social Security Administration, and other resources. After exclusions, 18805 patients who were treated with RAI and had no history of cancer at the time of the first treatment were eligible for the current analysis. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100-mGy dose to the organ or tissue were calculated using multivariable-adjusted linear dose-response models and were converted to relative risks (RR = 1 + ERR). The current analyses were conducted from April 28, 2017, to January 30, 2019. Exposures: Mean total administered activity of sodium iodide I 131 was 375 MBq for patients with Graves disease and 653 MBq for patients with toxic nodular goiter. Mean organ or tissue dose estimates ranged from 20 to 99 mGy (colon or rectum, ovary, uterus, prostate, bladder, and brain/central nervous system), to 100 to 400 mGy (pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, female breast, lung, oral mucosa, and marrow), to 1.6 Gy (esophagus), and to 130 Gy (thyroid gland). Main Outcomes and Measures: Site-specific and all solid-cancer mortality. Result(s): A total of 18805 patients were included in the study cohort, and the mean (SD) entry age was 49 (14) years. Most patients were women (14671 [78.0%]), and most had a Graves disease diagnosis (17615 [93.7%]). Statistically significant positive associations were observed for all solid cancer mortality (n = 1984; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P =.002), including female breast cancer (n = 291; RR at 100-mGy dose to the breast = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.003-1.32; P =.04) and all other solid cancers combined (n = 1693; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P =.01). The 100-mGy dose to the stomach and breast corresponded to a mean (SD) administered activity of 243 (35) MBq and 266 (58) MBq in patients with Graves disease. For every 1000 patients with hyperthyroidism receiving typical doses to the stomach (150 to 250 mGy), an estimated lifetime excess of 19 (95% CI, 3-40) to 32 (95% CI, 5-66) solid cancer deaths could occur. Conclusions and Relevance: In RAI-treated patients with hyperthyroidism, greater organ-absorbed doses appeared to be modestly positively associated with risk of death from solid cancer, including breast cancer. Additional studies are needed of the risks and advantages of all major treatment options available to patients with hyperthyroidism. Copyright Â© 2019 American Medical Association.

3612,"Radiation induced cardiovascular disease: An odyssey of bedside-bench-bedside approach The journey to Mars will be an ambitious, yet arduous task as it will entail culmination of all the information we have gathered over many decades. While the mission is of utmost importance, preservation of astronaut's well-being is paramount also. To that end, mitigation of radiation risk especially afflicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of great interest and challenge. Current data from astronauts on low earth orbit and Apollo missions provides insight on the risk of CVD from radiation exposure. However, data is limited given the small cohort size of astronauts who embarked on just nine prolonged missions. Therefore, a cerebral approach to understanding and mitigating risks are essential. This paper discusses the need for a predictive preclinical model to help understand and mitigate the effects of radiation on astronauts. We will discuss strengths and limitations of preclinical models and the methods of validating and constructing a model to predict human clinical outcomes. Our bedside-bench-bedside approach focuses on adapting the preclinical model through common investigative tools used between humans and animals. The result will be an optimization of preclinical model to a point of being a surrogate clinical model capable of predicting CVD outcomes in astronauts exposed to radiation.

2352,"The distribution of thirteen GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain. III. Embryonic and postnatal development The embryonic and postnatal expression of 13 GABAA receptor subunit genes in the rat CNS was studied by in situ hybridization. Each transcript exhibited a unique regional and temporal developmental expression profile. For example, in both embryonic and early postnatal cortex and thalamus, expression of the alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and beta 3 mRNAs was pronounced. In particular, the alpha 5 gene expression underwent a prominent peak in early brain. Subsequently, the thalamocortical expression of these four genes substantially diminished and was superseded in the adult by the alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, and delta subunit mRNAs. Similarly, gamma 1 and gamma 3 gene expression also dropped markedly during development, their initial stronger expression being restricted to relatively few structures. In contrast, gamma 2 gene expression was widespread and mostly remained constant with increasing age. The medial septum and globus pallidus were regions expressing few subunits in both early postnatal and adult stages, allowing clear developmental combinatorial changes to be inferred (alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 1 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 1/gamma 2, respectively). In contrast, cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibited no developmental switch, expressing only the alpha 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs from birth to adult. Certain GABAA transcripts were also detected in germinal zones (e.g., beta 1, beta 3, gamma 1) and in embryonic peripheral tissues such as dorsal root ganglia (e.g., alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 3, gamma 2) and intestine (gamma 3). Some parallels in regional and temporal CNS expression were noted (e.g., alpha 1 beta 2, alpha 2 beta 3, alpha 4/alpha 6 delta), whereas the alpha 5 and beta 1 regional mRNA expressions converted over time. The changes of GABAA receptor subunit gene expression suggest a molecular explanation for earlier observations on changing ligand binding affinities. Thus, the composition, and presumably properties, of embryonic/early postnatal rat GABAA receptors differs markedly from those expressed in the adult brain.",Excluded

Wild-type (WT) but not Fmr1-null mice rapidly adapt to relocating the shock; concurrently, SG/MG maxima (SGdom) decrease in WT but not in cognitively inflexible Fmr1-null mice. During SGdom, putative pyramidal cell ensembles represent distant locations; during place avoidance, these are avoided places. During shock relocation, WT ensembles represent distant locations near the currently correct shock zone, but Fmr1-null ensembles represent the formerly correct zone. These findings indicate that recollection occurs when CA1 SG dominates MG and that accurate recollection of inappropriate memories explains Fmr1-null cognitive inflexibility.",Excluded
3282,"Acute vision loss: A potential novel indication for intraarterial chemotherapy in the treatment of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (case report) Congress Abstract Introduction: The combination of radiotherapy and concomitant intraarterial cisplatin (RADPLAT) is well recognized in controlling locally invasive unresectable sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC). However, no reliable data are available for acute administration of intraarterial chemotherapy alone for palliation of acute vision loss in patients with unresectable SNUC involving the optic nerve. Objective(s): To suggest a novel indication for compassionate use of intraarterial chemotherapy alone in the acute setting in patients with advanced SNUC associated vision loss. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented with bloody nasal discharge, left proptosis, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. Both CT and MRI of the head and neck revealed a large 6.2-cm sinonasal mass extending through the cribriform plate to the dural, left maxillary sinus, and left orbit resulting proptosis with involvement of the optic nerve. The patient was not a surgical candidate due to intracranial extension with dural involvement. The patient's visual acuity in the left eye was 2400/20 on presentation. The patient underwent biopsy, which revealed SNUC. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning requires approximately 1 week to orchestrate at our institution. We decided to administer supratherapeutic intraarterial cisplatin acutely, along with thiosulfate infusion without radiation in an attempt to save the patient's vision. The patient experienced an increase in pain initially. However, over the following 5 days, the degree of proptosis diminished markedly and vision improved substantially without IMRT. The patient's follow-up vision testing revealed 30/20 vision in the left eye at 1 week and 20/20 vision at 2 weeks following therapy. Subsequent MRI revealed marked necrosis and decrease in size of the mass. Conclusion(s): Although we are not specifically advocating intraarterial administration of chemotherapy alone for the treatment of head and neck tumors, it may be effective in the acute setting for palliation of acute vision loss related to compression by head and neck tumors such as SNUC.",Excluded

18,"High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue as initial therapy for anaplastic oligodendroglioma Purpose: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma is a chemosensitive glial neoplasm. To improve disease control and postpone cranial radiotherapy, we designed a phase II study of intensive procarbazine, lomunstine and vincristine followed by high-dose thiotepa with autologous stem cell rescue for patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic or aggressive oligodendroglioma. Patients and Methods: Sixty-nine patients with a median age of 42 (range: 18-67) and a median Karnofsky Performance Score of 90 (range: 70-100) were enrolled. Sixteen patients had a prior diagnosis of low-grade oligodendroglioma and 16 had mixed oligoastrocytoma pathology. Only patients with demonstrably chemosensitive enhancing tumors or those free of enhancing tumor after surgery and induction therapy were eligible to receive high-dose thiotepa. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients (57%) completed the transplant regimen; their estimated median progression-free survival is 69 months and median overall survival has not been reached. Twelve transplanted patients (31 %) relapsed. Neither histology nor prior low-grade oligodendroglioma correlated with relapse; however, persistent non-enhancing tumor at transplant conferred an increased risk of relapse (p = 0.028). The transplant regimen was well-tolerated; median hospital stay was 20 days (range: 7-43) with a median time to ANC and platelet engraftment of 10 days. Thirty patients (43%) did not receive high-dose thiotepa because of stable or progressive disease (n = 21), excessive toxicity (n = 4), refusal of further therapy (n = 2), failure to obtain insurance coverage (n = 2), or other (n - 1). No treatment-related or long-term neurotoxicity was seen in the transplanted patients.

We had, first in the world, treated with BNCT for a patient with recurrent head and neck Cancers (HNC) in 2001. Method(s): From December, 2001 to February, 2013, we have treated a total of 35 patients with recurrent HNC by means of 52 applications of BNCT. Histopathologically, there were 24 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 7 with salivary gland carcinomas and 4 with sarcomas. All of them had received standard therapy and subsequently developed recurrent disease for which there were no other treatment options. All of the patients received intravenously either a combination of two boron containing drugs, sodium borocaptate (BSH, 5g) and boronophenylalanine (BPA, 250mg/kg) or BPA (500mg/kg) alone. In this report we will summarize the clinical results and outcomes of 35 patients with HNC who had received BNCT at either the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURI) or the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) nuclear reactor. Result(s): All of the patients had advanced disease and 17 of 35 (49%) had regional lymph node metastases and 10 out of 35 (29%) had distant metastases at the time of treatment. (1) Boron concentration ratios of tumor/normal tissue (T/N ratio), as determined by <sup>18</sup>FBPA-PET imaging were 1.8-7.0 for SCC, 2.5-4.0 for sarcomas and 2.5-3.7 for parotid tumors. (1) Regression rates were CR: 18 patients (51%), PR: 13 (37%), PD: 3 (9%), and not evaluated (NE):1patient. The overall patient response rate was 88%. (2) The Mean Survival Time was 24.2 months and the 4 year and 7-year OS rates were 42% and 36% , respectively. (3) Survival times following BNCT ranged from 1 to 95months. (4) BNCT improved QOL, PS and survival times. (5) The primary adverse events were brain necrosis, osteomyelitis and transient mucositis and alopecia.

3450,"Neuropelveology. Hope for patients suffering from intractable pelvic pain and for people with spinal cord injury (SCI)?. [German] Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) are common conditions involving many medical specialities, each with its own approach to diagnosis and treatment. Management of these conditions requires knowledge of pelvic organ systems, neuro-functional pelvic anatomy, and of the musculoskeletal, neurologic and psychiatric aspects. No current speciality seems to be devoted to all these aspects of the field. Neuropelveology is an emerging speciality focusing on the pathologies of the pelvic nervous system. It is based on a neurological/ neurosurgical approach combining the knowledge required for a proper neurologic diagnosis with advanced laparoscopic surgery in selected cases of CPP/CPPS. The laparoscopic approach to the pelvic nerves enables nerve-sparing techniques, neurosurgical procedures but also selective placement of stimulating electrodes to all nerves and plexuses for treatment of neuropathic pain and dysfunctions. For patients with spinal cord injuries, this technique enables new strategies for control/recovery-assisted locomotion in selected paraplegics. The development of new technologies does not only assist spinal cord injured people with the common problems associated with inertia when confined to a wheelchair, but finds further revolutionary applications in the world of space missions. In addressing the physical disadvantages the astronaut faces when weightless in space by the introduction of an >>in-body<< micro stimulator, which allows muscle mass and bone density to be maintained even whilst the astronaut is sleeping, the stimulating technique provides an extremely effective and time-saving strength training program. The advantages of the LION Procedure (Laparoscopic Implantation of Neuroprothesis) are profound when it comes to counteracting the effects of prolonged microgravity on the human body. It should be also appreciated that the capability of the implantation of micro stimulators within the body to nerves for muscle stimulation, opens the door to a whole new area of humanity, the >>e-control-body<<, in which implanted electronics may help the human body to better performance and a longer life as a result (ageing control).

We investigated the potential of targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) to improve the therapeutic outcome of combined radiotherapy and TMZ in glioblastoma. METHODS ANDMATERIALS: We evaluated the preclinical potential of a STAT3 inhibitor, Cpd188 combined with temozolomide and radiation by in vitro clonogenic assays using two established glioblastoma cell lines (U251, U87) and two patients-derived glioblastoma cell lines (GBL12, GBL28) and in vivo studies using nude mice bearing intracranial U251 xenografts. RESULT(S): Cpd188 potentiated the radiosensitizing effect ofTMZ in U251 glioblastoma cell line which has high levels of p-STAT3 expression and in vitro. Increased radiosensitizing effects ofTMZwere associated with the induction of apoptosis and the reversion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cpd188 delayed in vivo tumor growth both alone and in combination with fractionated radiation and TMZ with a trend toward improved survival rates. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections showed that Cpd188 decreased the expression of CD31 (a marker of endothelial proliferation), vascular endothelial growth factor, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, suggesting that Cpd188 also has anti-angiogenic effects. We also confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of Cpd188 of GBL28 cell line which was originated from a patient who had a glioblastoma and also was confirmed high level of STAT3 expression and unmethylated MGMT.

3619,"A model for assessing cognitive impairment after fractionated whole-brain irradiation in nonhuman primates To investigate the effect of fractionated whole-brain irradiation on nonhuman primates, 6-9-year-old male rhesus monkeys were irradiated with 40 Gy delivered as two 5-Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed 5 days/week for 4 months prior to fractionated whole-brain irradiation and for 11 months after irradiation using a Delayed-Match-to-Sample (DMS) task at both low and high cognitive loads. Local rates of cerebral glucose metabolism were measured prior to and 9 months after irradiation using [(18)F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography. Low cognitive load trials did not reveal a significant reduction in performance until 7 months after irradiation; performance then declined progressively. In high cognitive load trials, the initial impairment was observed ~1 month after irradiation. This was followed by a transient recovery period over the next 1-2 months, after which performance declined progressively through 11 months after irradiation. Nine months after irradiation, glucose uptake during the DMS task was decreased in the cuneate and prefrontal cortex and was increased in the cerebellum and thalamus compared with the levels prior to irradiation. Results from this pilot study suggest that the radiation-induced changes in cognition and brain metabolism observed in rhesus monkeys may be similar to those observed in brain tumor patients receiving brain irradiation.",Included

[Spanish] AIMS: To evaluate the survival rates, prognostic factors and adverse events in patients with pituitary adenomas following fractionated stereotactic-guided radiotherapy (FSRT). MATERIAL AND METHODS. Fifty-six patients with pituitary adenomas were treated with FSRT; 23 patients (41.1%) had primary adenomas, 33 had recurrent disease; 24 (42.9%) with non-functional and 32 (57.1%) with functional adenomas. Using conventional fractionation, median total dose administered was 54 Gy (range: 24-56 Gy). RESULTS. The median follow-up was 51 months (range: 9-102) and, at the time of analysis, 49 patients were alive and disease-free, 1 patient was alive with reduced visual acuity and biochemical indications of recurrence, 2 patients had died from the disease and 1 patient had died from unrelated causes. Overall survival was 94% (50/53) and overall local tumour control was 92% (49/53). Univariate analysis indicated hormonal secretion (ACTH) and previous radiotherapy as being statistically significant. Fourteen patients (25%) had minor side-effects during treatment and 3 patients (5.4%) had late-onset events; 2 with optical neuropathy (both patients had other relevant co-existing diseases) and 1 patient had brain necrosis (re-irradiation).

3336,"Emerging locoregional therapy Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT): SIRT, or radioembolization, delivers yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres via a catheter in the hepatic artery to treat intra-hepatic disease. SIRT takes advantage of the fact that the blood supply for much of the normal liver parenchyma arrives through the portal circulation, while tumors are preferentially fed by the arterial system. Glass- or resin-based microspheres tagged with Y-90 are delivered typically in a ""lobar"" fashion and preferentially distribute into the tumoral and peritumoral vasculature, thereby delivering a high radiation dose (>100 Gy). Because Y-90 is a beta emitter, the effect is relatively selective and mostly affects only the metastatic sites while sparing normal liver parenchyma. The two currently available Y-90 products include SIR-spheres and TheraSphere. SIR-spheres deliver a higher dose per treatment and are more embolic. In contrast, the TheraSphere product delivers a higher specific radioactivity dose per microsphere allowing for smaller dose per treatment and are not as embolic. Both products have been shown to be welltolerated. SIRT can be an effective therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as metastatic colorectal or neuroendocrine liver disease.",Excluded

Several neurological diseases have already been identified as being due to a deficiency in DNA end-processing activities. Two common dirty ends, 3'-P and 5'-OH, are processed by mammalian polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a bifunctional enzyme with 3'-phosphatase and 5'-kinase activities. We have made the unexpected observation that PNKP stably associates with Ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a polyglutamine repeat-containing protein mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD). This disease is one of the most common dominantly inherited ataxias worldwide; the defect in SCA3 is due to CAG repeat expansion (from the normal 14-41 to 55-82 repeats) in the ATXN3 coding region. However, how the expanded form gains its toxic function is still not clearly understood. Here we report that purified wild-type (WT) ATXN3 stimulates, and by contrast the mutant form specifically inhibits, PNKP's 3' phosphatase activity in vitro. ATXN3-deficient cells also show decreased PNKP activity. Furthermore, transgenic mice conditionally expressing the pathological form of human ATXN3 also showed decreased 3'-phosphatase activity of PNKP, mostly in the deep cerebellar nuclei, one of the most affected regions in MJD patients' brain. Finally, long amplicon quantitative PCR analysis of human MJD patients' brain samples showed a significant accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Our results thus indicate that the accumulation of DNA strand breaks due to functional deficiency of PNKP is etiologically linked to the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD.",Excluded
815,"Distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells in X-irradiated rats. An electrophysiological study 1. The distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells has been studied with intracellular recordings in X-irradiated and normal rats. 2. In the treated rats, multiple steps in the post-synaptic potential were elicited in 57% of the Purkinje cells by graded stimulation of the climbing fibres, the response was all-or-none in character in the other cells and in all Purkinje cells recorded in normal animals. In the neurones exhibiting the former type of response, no collision was seen along the afferent fibres during interaction experiments between just-threshold juxtafastigial and maximal olivary stimulations, whereas a collision always occurred when all-or-none responses were recorded. 3. These results show that in X-irradiated rats, the majority of Purkinje cells have a multiple innervation by two to four climbing fibres, instead of the one-to-one relationship seen normally. 4. Input resistances and total electrotonic lengths of Purkinje cells were measured in normal and treated rats. Mean values for these two parameters were higher than normal in multiply innervated cells. 5. Mean time course and mean current for reversal of the post-synaptic potential elicited in Purkinje cells by stimulation of the climbing fibres were nearly the same in mono- and in multiply innervated neurones. In multiply innervated cells, time courses and currents for reversal were independent of the size of the response or varied slightly with it, suggesting that the climbing fibres involved innervated territories whose electrotonic distance from the recording site were either the same or slightly different. 6. Interactions between two all-or-none steps of the graded post-synaptic potential evoked in multiply innervated cells by juxtafastigial and olivary stimulations revealed either a very weak or a very marked shunting effect between synapses of the two climbing fibres involved. 7. These results indicate that the over-all distribution of climbing fibre synapses on multiply innervated Purkinje cells is not grossly abnormal and that two fibres contacting a given cell can be either intermingled on the same dendrites, or segregated on distinct dendritic branches. 8. In general, the present study does not suggest the existence of a strong competition among climbing fibres innervating each Purkinje cell during development at least when granule cells are absent.",Included
2283,"Combination of hypomorphic mutations of the Drosophila homologues of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and nucleosome assembly protein family genes disrupts morphogenesis, memory and detoxification Aryl hydrocarbon receptor is essential for biological responses to endogenous and exogenous toxins in mammals. Its Drosophila homolog spineless plays an important role in fly morphogenesis. We have previously shown that during morphogenesis spineless genetically interacts with CG5017 gene, which encodes a nucleosome assembly factor and may affect cognitive function of the fly. We now demonstrate synergistic interactions of spineless and CG5017 in pathways controlling oxidative stress response and long-term memory formation in Drosophila melanogaster. Oxidative stress was induced by low doses of X-ray irradiation of flies carrying hypomorphic mutation of spineless, mutation of CG5017, and their combination. To determine the sensitivity of these mutants to pharmacological modifiers of the irradiation effect, we irradiated flies growing on standard medium supplemented by radiosensitizer furazidin and radioprotector serotonin. The effects of irradiation were investigated by analyzing leg and antenna morphological structures and by using real-time PCR to measure mRNA expression levels for spineless, Cyp6g1 and Gst-theta genes. We also examined long-term memory in these mutants using conditioned courtship suppression paradigm. Our results show that the interaction of spineless and CG5017 is important for regulation of morphogenesis, long-term memory formation, and detoxification during oxidative stress.

1944,"Planning evaluation of C-arm cone beam ct angiography for target delineation in stereotactic radiation surgery of brain arteriovenous malformations Purpose: Stereotactic radiation surgery (SRS) is one of the therapeutic modalities currently available to treat cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Conventionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are used in combination to identify the target volume for SRS treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of C-arm cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the treatment planning of SRS for cerebral AVMs. Methods and Materials: Sixteen consecutive patients treated for brain AVMs at our institution were included in this retrospective study. Prior to treatment, all patients underwent MRA, DSA, and C-arm CBCT. All images were coregistered using the GammaPlan planning system. AVM regions were delineated independently by 2 physicians using either C-arm CBCT or MRA, resulting in 2 volumes: a CBCT volume (VCBCT) and an MRA volume (V<inf>MRA</inf>). SRS plans were generated based on the delineated regions. Results: The average volume of treatment targets delineated using C-arm CBCT and MRA were similar, 6.40 cm<sup>3</sup> and 6.98 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively (P=.82). However, significant regions of nonoverlap existed. On average, the overlap of the MRA with the C-arm CBCT was only 52.8% of the total volume. In most cases, radiation plans based on V<inf>MRA</inf> did not provide adequate dose to the region identified on C-arm CBCT; the mean minimum dose to V<inf>CBCT</inf> was 29.5%, whereas the intended goal was 45% (P<.001). The mean volume of normal brain receiving 12 Gy or more in C-arm CBCT-based plans was not greater than in the MRA-based plans. Conclusions: Use of C-arm CBCT images significantly alters the delineated regions of AVMs for SRS planning, compared to that of MRA/MRI images. CT-based planning can be accomplished without increasing the dose to normal brain and may represent a more accurate definition of the nidus, increasing the chances for successful obliteration.

3186,"Efficacy of salvage stereotactic radiotherapy for recurrent glioma: impact of tumor morphology and method of target delineation on local control In this study, we assessed the efficacy of salvage stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for recurrent glioma. From August 2008 to December 2012, 30 patients with recurrent glioma underwent salvage SRT. The initial histological diagnoses were World Health Organization (WHO) grades II, III, and IV in 6, 9, and 15 patients, respectively. Morphologically, the type of recurrence was classified as diffuse or other. Two methods of clinical target delineation were used: A, a contrast-enhancing tumor; or B, a contrast-enhancing tumor with a 3-10-mm margin and/or surrounding fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) high-intensity areas. The prescribed dose was 22.5-35 Gy delivered in five fractions at an isocenter using a dynamic conformal arc technique. The overall survival (OS) and local control probability (LCP) after SRT were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A univariate analysis was used to test the effect of clinical variables on OS/LCP. The median follow-up period was 272 days after SRT. The OS and LCP were 83% and 56% at 6 months after SRT, respectively. Morphologically, the tumor type correlated significantly with both OS and LCP (P = 0.006 and <0.001, respectively). The method of target delineation also had a significant influence on LCP (P = 0.016). Grade 3 radiation necrosis was observed in two patients according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3. Salvage SRT was safe and effective for recurrent glioma, especially non-diffuse recurrences. Improved local control might be obtained by adding a margin to contrast-enhancing tumors or including increased FLAIR high-intensity areas.",Excluded

The MTD established was 5 mg/kg, given intravenously 5 days a week for the first 10 RT fractions, then 3 times a week for the duration of RT. The 7 patients enrolled in the third dose level and the 94 enrolled in phase 2 received this dose. Of these 101 patients, 87 were eligible and evaluable. Median survival time was 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.9-17.6 months), not significantly different from that of the historical control (P=.36). Median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.7-9.6 months). One patient (1%) experienced a grade 5 adverse event possibly related to therapy during the concurrent phase, and none experience toxicity during adjuvant TMZ therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment was well tolerated, but median OS did not reach improvement specified by protocol compared to historical control, indicating that the combination of standard RT with TMZ and MGd did not achieve a significant survival advantage.",Excluded
2085,"Targeted disruption of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene in miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a genetic disease caused by germline biallelic mutation in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) that results in partial or complete loss of ATM expression or activity. A diverse phenotype of the disease includes progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, radiation hypersensitivity, increased cancer incidence, immunodeficiency and chromosomal instability. The frequency of A-T in the United States and United Kingdom has been estimated to be 1:40 000. Heterozygous carriers may also have predisposition to diverse cancers. Although ATM-deficient mice have been produced, none reflects the extent of neurological abnormalities involving the loss of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum seen in patients. Hence, miniature pigs, which are anatomically and physiologically closer to humans, might serve as an alternative model for human A-T. In the present study, we attempted a targeted disruption of ATM in miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Most A-T patients possess mutated ATM with truncation, resulting in prematurely terminated ATM proteins that are highly unstable. To induce the truncation of ATM, we disrupted exon 59 region of ATM that has been known to be critical for ATM kinase activity. Miniature pig fetal fibroblasts were transfected with ATM-targeting vector and treated by neomycin for 2 weeks. A total of 139 colonies were screened by PCR and 3 among them were identified as homologous recombinants with monoallelic disruption of ATM (targeting efficiency=2.1%). One of the 3 colonies was chosen and used for subsequent nuclear transfer. In total, 611 nuclear transfer embryos reconstructed with ATM-targeted fetal fibroblasts were transferred into 5 surrogate gilts. Two gilts became pregnant and developed to term with a total of 5 live piglets delivered. Being analysed by PCR, all piglets born were found to be ATM gene-targeted. Because conventional murine models of human A-T have provided only limited insights into therapies and pharmacological treatments, the generation of miniature pigs with disrupted ATM will allow new opportunities to more precisely understand A-T and to accelerate discovery of strategies for prevention and treatment of the disease. In addition, such animals may be utilised in studying cancer with respect to the involvement of ATM in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis.",Excluded
1002,"Concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) using involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) in limited disease small cell lung cancer (SCLC-LD): A tertiary center experience Background: To evaluate, in a tertiary referral center, the results of CRT using IF-RT in SCLC-LD patients in terms of loco-regional tumor control, survival and toxicity. Method(s): As of February 2002, a concurrent CRT protocol was launched for patients with confirmed diagnosis of SCLC-LD. All patients treated in accordance with the protocol were reviewed. LD staging was documented by using computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, upper abdomen, and brain and, in most cases, 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET). The CRT protocol consisted of thoracic radiotherapy delivered up to a dose of 50 Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy, starting concurrently with the second of four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin 60 mg/ m2 d1, Q3w and etoposide 120 mg/m2 d1-3, Q3w). Radiotherapy was given using IF-RT, targeted to the tumor, PET positive nodes and nodes >1cm in smallest diameter on CT-scan. Response after CRT was evaluated with CT-scan. Patients with a (near) complete response (nCR) received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) up to 30Gy/2Gy within 6 weeks after completion of CRT. Result(s): Between 2/2002 and 2/2009, 53 patients were treated according to this CRT protocol: female/male 15/38; median age: 58 years (range 39-72); clinical TNM: cT1-4N0-3M0. Pathology was obtained using bronchoscopy/TBNA (72%), mediastinoscopy (26%) or thoracotomy (2%). PETstaging was performed in 41/53 patients (77%): 33 isolated PET, 8 PET-CT. CRT was given according to protocol in 50 patients, 2 received cisplatinpemetrexed as first chemotherapy cycle, 1 started radiotherapy with the 3rd chemotherapy cycle. Median time between start of treatment and end of radiotherapy was 59 days (range 53-73). of the 32 patients in nCR, 30 received PCI 30Gy/2Gy, 2 of them 30Gy/3Gy. Ten out of 21 patients in partial remission (PR) received PCI (8: 30Gy/2Gy; 1:30Gy/3Gy; and 1: 20Gy/4Gy). of the total group, 20 patients did not relapse/progress. In the remaining 33 patients, site of first relapse/progression was locoregional in 10, distant in 15 and both combined in 8. of the primary loco-regional relapses, 3 were in-field (2 were salvaged by surgery) and 3 partially in- and out-of-field. Only one patient developed an isolated out-of-field relapse. Three PR patients progressed loco-regionally before developing metastases. After a median (mean) follow-up of 24 (38) months, median overall and progression-free survival were 28,3 and 26 months, respectively. Overall survival at 1, 2 and 5 years was 81,1%, 58,4% and 40,6%. At the same time points, respectively 85,5%, 63,1% and 52,6% of patients were free of loco-regional recurrence, respectively. Conclusion(s): The outcome of concomitant chemotherapy with IF-RT (up to 50Gy/2Gy) starting with the second chemotherapy cycle, compares favorably with results from other series, which may in part be due to the dedicated staging strategy resulting in truly limited SCLC. The low number of isolated local relapses seems to support the use of IF-RT, provided that PET is used for diagnosis and treatment planning. The observation that a relatively high proportion of patients fails to reach nCR, suggests that higher radiotherapy doses may be the way to further improve the outcome.",Excluded

Preincubation with 10 microM CBX reduced the amount of LTP induced by weak theta-burst stimulation (TBS) or a single train of stimuli (HFS; 1s at 100 Hz), but did not affect LTP induced by 30-min perfusion with 10 mM taurine. Incubation with 50-100 microM CBX 15 min before HFS or TBS abolished tetanus-induced LTP. At 100 microM CBX, the concentration that is used for the blockade of gap junctions in vitro, a long-lasting depression of fEPSPs was observed which persisted under the blockade of NMDA receptors, and receptors for corticosteroids. A similar depression was produced by the CBX inactive analogue glycyrrhizic acid and the broad spectrum calcium channel antagonist ruthenium red. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from acutely isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that CBX exerts a selective dose-dependent inhibition of NMDA-evoked currents with an IC(50)=104 microM. Thus the widely used gap junction uncoupler CBX acts as an antagonist at NMDA receptors and consequently impairs the induction of LTP.",Excluded
294,"Primary central nervous system lymphomas PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B cell lymphoma that occurs in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. Primary ocular lymphoma represents an important variant of this disease. The outcome for patients with PCNSL is rapidly improving with new treatment strategies. This review focuses on recent advances, investigations, and controversies in the management of these increasingly important malignancies.RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of PCNSL is rising in immunocompetent patients over the age of 60 years for unexplained reasons. However, the incidence of AIDS-related PCNSL, which is related to Epstein-Barr virus infections, has fallen with the institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy. During the past decade, standard therapy has evolved from cranial irradiation to high dose methotrexate-based regimens. This shift in therapy has been associated with an increase in the median survival of patients from 1 year to longer than 3 years, and with an equally striking reduction in neurotoxicity if whole brain radiation is avoided. Optimal therapeutic results require careful attention to opportunistic infections, thromboembolic disease, and renal toxicities associated with high dose methotrexate.SUMMARY: Overall, PCNSLs are increasing in frequency and the results of therapy for this disease have dramatically improved during the past decade. Many important therapeutic questions remain unanswered. These include the optimal dose, frequency, and duration of methotrexate, as well as the roles of additional systemic chemotherapy drugs, intrathecal therapy, and cranial irradiation. Further progress in this uncommon disease will depend on entering patients into carefully designed multicenter clinical trials to build upon the significant advances that have been made.

987,"Primary central nervous system lymphoma Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) comprises approximately 5 % of all primary brain tumors. During the past two decades the incidence of PCNSL has increased, and as a result clinical research to determine the optimal treatment for PCNSL patients also has increased. Diagnosis is based on histopathologic findings traditionally established by biopsy only. More recent data raise controversy and challenges this biopsy-only paradigm, showing a potential advantage for surgical resection with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Using high-dose intravenous (IV) methotrexate-based chemotherapy alone or as part of a regimen can lead to disease cure. The role of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) remains controversial and more frequently is omitted to avoid potential delayed neurocognitive effects, especially in patients older than age 60 years. Newer data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) using five cycles of Rituximab, Methotrexate, Vincristine, and Procarbazine (R-MVP) followed by low-dose WBRT (2,340 cgy), and then two cycles of Ara-C had excellent disease control with low neuro-toxicity and is now the basis of an ongoing RTOG (Radiation Treatment Oncology Group) trial comparing early versus delayed WBRT. Other chemotherapeutics and novel treatments, such as autologous stem cell transplantation, are being studied for potential use in PCNSL. Unlike many other primary brain tumors seen in adults, PCNSL is potentially curable; therefore, balancing treatment decisions with long-term neurocognitive effects and toxicities is crucial.",Excluded
1107,"Does the pretherapeutic tumor SUV in 68Ga DOTATOC PET predict the absorbed dose of 177Lu octreotate? PURPOSE: Selection of candidates for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is increasingly based on receptor positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, including the common tracer Ga DOTATOC. However, no studies have yet compared standardized uptake values (SUVs) and absorbed doses in this field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of 21 patients with 61 evaluable tumor lesions undergoing both pretherapeutic Ga DOTATOC-PET/CT (Biograph Duo [Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany]; PET acquisition, 75.3 +/- 15.4 minutes postinjection; 117.3 +/- 33.9 MBq Ga DOTATOC) and PRRT with Lu octreotate (7.47 +/- 1.39 GBq; intratherapeutic tumor dosimetry with serial whole-body scans; 1, 2, and 4 days postinjection) at our institution. SUVs were compared with the tumor-absorbed doses per injected activity (D/A0) of the subsequent first treatment cycle. RESULT(S): The correlation of SUV and D/A0 was r = 0.72 (SUVmean) and r = 0.71 (SUVmax), both P < 0.001. Pancreatic origin and hepatic localization were associated with higher D/A0, and chromogranin A level and Ki-67 index had no influence on SUV or D/A0. High-SUV lesions (SUVmean >15; SUVmax >25) resulted in high D/A0 (>10 Gy/GBq) in 66.7% to 70.8% and low D/A0 (<5 Gy/GBq) in only 8.3% to 12.5% on subsequent PRRT. The mentioned low D/A0 range, on the other hand, was achieved by all lesions with SUVmean <7 or SUVmax <9. CONCLUSION(S): Somatostatin receptor PET imaging may predict tumor-absorbed doses. The ability to indicate insufficient target irradiation by a low SUV could aid in selection of appropriate candidates for PRRT. However, larger series are needed to confirm and validate these initial findings. Â© 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

1653,"Clinical approach and surgical strategy for spinal disorders in pregnant women Introduction: Spinal diseases that require urgent surgical treatment are rare during pregnancy. There are many important diagnostic and therapeutic aspects that must be taken into account in such situations, especially if there is an acute indication for surgery. The data is available only in the form of case reports. Method(s): The study included consecutive pregnant patients who underwent spinal surgery at five neurosurgical high-volume centers between 2010 and 2017. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical data were derived from medical records. Result(s): Overall, 23 pregnant patients were assigned to acute spinal surgery. Two of them underwent preoperative cesarian section in the 34th and 32th week. The other 21 patients underwent surgery during pregnancy. Three patients were operated upon twice or more during the same pregnancy. The median age was 33 years (min 22, max 41 years). The median gestational age was 13 completed weeks (min 7, max 34 weeks). The indications were: n = 14 lumbar herniated intervertebral discs presenting with cauda equina syndrome in 4 cases, high graded motor deficit in 7 cases, and acute pain in 3 cases; n = 4 unstable spine injuries; n = 1 intramedullary tumor with paraparesis; n = 1 paraspinal infection; n = 1 swann cell nerve root tumor presenting with higher graded paresis. Perioperative pregnancy monitoring was done with an ultrasound or ultrasound plus CTG after the 24th week of gestation in the majority of cases. All surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia (balanced anaesthesia n = 12, total intravenous anaesthesia n = 9). Median duration of surgery was 90 min (min 41, max 240). 15 patients were placed in a prone position and 6 in a right or left lateral decubitus position depending on the gestational age and the type of surgery. In 9 cases no intraoperative fluoroscopy was done, in 12 cases fluoroscopic verficiation of spine level or guidance of instrumentation placement was performed with a median fluoroscopic time of 6 s (min 1, max 24 s). No postoperative neurosurgical complications occured. Two patients underwent medical abortion due to radiation exposure before the pregnancy was diagnosed. Among the other 19 patients, 2 suffered transient gestational diabetes, and one patient presented with vaginal bleeding without any signs for fetal complications. According to our current follow-up data, no miscarriages, stillbirths or other severe obstetric complications occured during the further courses of pregnancy. All patients improved neurologically after the surgery. Conclusion(s): Spinal surgical procedures during pregnancy seem to be generally safe. Nevertheless, the indication for surgery has to be very strict and surgical procedures during pregnany should be reserved for emergency cases with acute or threatening neurological deficit.

However, five daily doses of 0.5 Gy increased the survival time of animals bearing U-251 MG tumors 5 days without curing any animals of their tumors. Ten doses of 0.3 Gy given over 2 weeks extended the lifespan of the host animals 9 days without curing any animals. For U-87 MG tumors, 5 daily doses of 3 Gy produced an increased lifespan of 8 days without curing any animals, and 10 doses of 1 Gy prolonged lifespan 5.5 days without curing any animals. The differences in extension of life span between the 5- and 10-fraction protocols were minor for either tumor type.CONCLUSION: The finding that the U-251 MG tumors are more sensitive than U-87 MG tumors, despite the fact that U-251 MG tumors contain many more hypoxic cells than U-87 MG tumors, suggests the intrinsic cellular radiosensitivities of these cell lines are more important than hypoxia in determining their in vivo radiosensitivities.",Excluded
1110,"Charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular malformations Heavy charged-particle radiation has unique physical characteristics that offer several advantages over photons and protons for stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial AVMs. These include improved dose distributions with depth in tissue, small angle of lateral scattering, and sharp distal fall-off of dose in the Bragg ionization peak. Under multi-institutionally approved clinical trials, we have used stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery to treat approximately 400 patients with symptomatic, surgically inaccessible vascular malformations at the UCB-LBL 184-in synchrocyclotron and bevatron. Treatment planning for stereotactic heavy charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular disorders integrates anatomic and physical information from the stereotactic cerebral angiogram and stereotactic CT and MR imaging scans for each patient, using computerized treatment-planning calculations for optimal isodose contour distribution. The shape of an intracranial AVM is associated strongly with its treatability and potential clinical outcome. In this respect, heavy charged-particle radiosurgery has distinct advantages over other radiosurgical methods; the unique physical properties allow the shaping of individual beams to encompass the contours of large and complexly shaped AVMs, while sparing important adjacent neural structures. We have had a long-term dose-searching clinical protocol in collaboration with SUMC and UCSF and have followed up over 300 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, treatment doses ranged from 45 GyE to 35 GyE. Currently, total doses up to 25 GyE are delivered to treatment volumes ranging from 0.1 cm3 to 70 cm3. This represents a relatively homogeneous dose distribution, with the 90% isodose surface contoured to the periphery of the lesion; there is considerable protection of normal adjacent brain tissues, and most of the brain receives no radiation exposure. Dose selection depends on the volume, shape, and location of the AVM and several other factors, including the volume of normal brain that must be traversed by the plateau portion of the charged-particle beam. The first 230 patients have been evaluated clinically to the end of 1989. Using the clinical grading of Drake, about 90% of the patients had an excellent or good neurologic grade, about 5% had a poor grade, and about 5% had progression of disease and died, or died as a result of unrelated intercurrent illness. Neuroradiologic follow-up to the end of 1989 indicated the following rates of complete angiographic obliteration 3 years after treatment: 90% to 95% for AVM treatment volumes less than 4 cm3, 90% to 95% for volumes 4 to 14 cm3, and 60% to 70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Excluded

In both cases difficulties exist in treating large volumes near organs at risk (OAR) with high dose levels. Particularly, more difficulties can occur in cases of re-irradiation. HT allows this kind of treatment by using of IMRT technique with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) associated with daily IGRT. Materials and Methods/Patients and Methods: Between October 2010 and April 2011 thirteen patients (9 male and 4 female) with advanced or recurrence head and neck cancer were enrolled in our study; in particular: 3 primary cutaneous advanced carcinoma (involving orbital and/or paranasal cavities), 4 recurrences after previous radiotherapy in the same site, 7 advanced head and neck cancer. The mean age was 63.2 years. Six patients received concomitant chemotherapy platinum-based. All patients underwent fiber-optic endoscopy, CT imaging and MRI imaging for staging. All patients also underwent 18-FDG-PET-CT virtual-simulation for treatment planning. All patients received a supportive odontostomatological and nutritional protocol. The treatment volumes were: the gross tumor volume and positive nodes (as visible at imaging) irradiated with curative doses (66-70.5 Gy in 30 fractions, 2.2-2.35 Gy/die); nodal levels at higher risk irradiated with prophylactic doses (60 Gy/30 fractions); loco-regional nodes irradiated with prophylactic doses (54 Gy/30 fractions). The countered organ at risk were: brain, brainstem, chiasm, optic nerve, lens, spinal cord, parotid glands, mandible, temporal-mandibular joint. In patients previously irradiated the prior treatment planning was reviewed in order to evaluate the overlapping of the irradiated volumes. Results were evaluated in terms of acute and sub-acute toxicity and clinical outcome. Toxicity was evaluated according to RTOG-EORTC scale. Fiber-optic endoscopy was performed 1 month after the end of radiotherapy. CT, MRI and PET-CT imaging were performed 3 months after treatment. Result(s): All patients completed the treatment. One patient required interruption of treatment for 2 days. Five patients required infusion medical therapy, during radiotherapy, with corticosteroids, antibiotics, anti-fungal, analgesics and antiinflammatory drugs and parenteral nutrition. Acute skin toxicity was: G1 in 9 patients, G2 in 2 patients, G3 in 1 patient. Acute mucous toxicity was: G1 in 8 patients, G2 in 4 patients, G3 in 1 patient. For three patients re-planning during radiation treatment was necessary because of relevant tumor volume reduction. Three patients have a complete clinical response during treatment, confirmed at post-treatment imaging. Five patients have a partial clinical response > 50% at the end of RT, confirmed at post-treatment imaging. Two patients have a partial clinical response < 50%, and 2 patients a stable disease after RT, confirmed at posttreatment imaging. The last patient had no sufficient follow-up to evaluate response. Late toxicity was not evaluated because of the short follow-up. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Our initial experience shows that HT allows delivering of high radiation doses to the tumor volume with good precision resulting from to the ability to verify daily set-up patients by megavoltage cone beam CT. Dose escalation results in objective clinical responses already during radiation treatment with possibility of re-planning, allowing for adaptive radiotherapy. Relevant toxicity, particularly in patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy, requires close monitoring of patients and supportive care to allow completing treatment. Our supportive odontostomatological and nutritional protocol is useful in this regard. Our results are absolutely preliminary, PET-CT is mandatory for contouring before the treatment and during radiotherapy for re-planning and also at the of radiotherapy for quantitative response evaluation. Further follow up is necessary to evaluate long term outcome and late toxicity.",Excluded

An exposure installation was used based on a test mobile phone employing a GSM signal at 915 MHz, all standard modulations included, output power level in pulses 2 W, specific absorption rate (SAR) 0.4 mW/g. Rats were exposed or sham exposed to MWs during 2 h. After exposure, cell suspensions were prepared from brain samples, as well as from spleen and thymus. For analysis of gene expression patterns, total RNA was extracted from cerebellum. Changes in chromatin conformation, which are indicative of stress response and genotoxic effects, were measured by the method of anomalous viscosity time dependencies (AVTD). DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Effects of MW exposure were observed on neither conformation of chromatin nor DNA DSBs. Gene expression profiles were obtained by Affymetrix U34 GeneChips representing 8800 rat genes and analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software. In cerebellum from all exposed animals, 11 genes were upregulated in a range of 1.34-2.74 fold and one gene was downregulated 0.48-fold (P < .0025). The induced genes encode proteins with diverse functions including neurotransmitter regulation, blood-brain barrier (BBB), and melatonin production.

Results Ga-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT showed sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 92.5%, respectively, for primary tumor and 98.5% and 100% for metastases. It was better than a conventional imaging modality for the detection of both primary tumor (p < 0.001) and metastases (p < 0.0001). It changed the management strategy in 22 patients (55%). On the basis of the results, 11 patients (27.5%) underwent surgery for primary lesions for surgically resectable loco regional disease. Five patients (12.5 %) detected with advanced stage of disease on PET were spared unnecessary surgery. Six patients (15%) with poor 68Ga-DOTA-NOC uptake were spared unnecessary octreotide therapy and were started on systemic chemotherapy. In addition, the detection of the expression of somatostatin receptors led to octreotide-based treatments in 25 patients. Conclusions 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT provides incremental diagnostic information compared to conventional imaging. It has significant impact in management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Extent of disease defined by Ga-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT can alter the surgical management of these patients. The detection of a high degree of somatostatin receptor expression can be exploited to treat patients with octreotide therapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and, conversely, a negative finding on 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/ CT can guide the treating physician to choose an alternate form of treatment. Additional benefit of 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT include patient convenience with short time acquisition and lower radiation exposure signifying the important role of 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET CT in clinical practice of neuroendocrine malignancies.",Excluded

2253,"Autonomous Optimization of Targeted Stimulation of Neuronal Networks Driven by clinical needs and progress in neurotechnology, targeted interaction with neuronal networks is of increasing importance. Yet, the dynamics of interaction between intrinsic ongoing activity in neuronal networks and their response to stimulation is unknown. Nonetheless, electrical stimulation of the brain is increasingly explored as a therapeutic strategy and as a means to artificially inject information into neural circuits. Strategies using regular or event-triggered fixed stimuli discount the influence of ongoing neuronal activity on the stimulation outcome and are therefore not optimal to induce specific responses reliably. Yet, without suitable mechanistic models, it is hardly possible to optimize such interactions, in particular when desired response features are network-dependent and are initially unknown. In this proof-of-principle study, we present an experimental paradigm using reinforcement-learning (RL) to optimize stimulus settings autonomously and evaluate the learned control strategy using phenomenological models. We asked how to (1) capture the interaction of ongoing network activity, electrical stimulation and evoked responses in a quantifiable 'state' to formulate a well-posed control problem, (2) find the optimal state for stimulation, and (3) evaluate the quality of the solution found. Electrical stimulation of generic neuronal networks grown from rat cortical tissue in vitro evoked bursts of action potentials (responses). We show that the dynamic interplay of their magnitudes and the probability to be intercepted by spontaneous events defines a trade-off scenario with a network-specific unique optimal latency maximizing stimulus efficacy. An RL controller was set to find this optimum autonomously. Across networks, stimulation efficacy increased in 90% of the sessions after learning and learned latencies strongly agreed with those predicted from open-loop experiments. Our results show that autonomous techniques can exploit quantitative relationships underlying activity-response interaction in biological neuronal networks to choose optimal actions. Simple phenomenological models can be useful to validate the quality of the resulting controllers.",Excluded

2832,"Action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the isolated photosensory pineal organ The effect of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), its agonists (muscimol, baclofen) and antagonist (bicuculline) on pineal ganglion cells of the luminosity type were studied in the isolated, superfused pineal organ of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Extracellular recordings revealed that GABA added through the superfusion medium caused a clear alteration of the activity of projecting neurons, which transmit luminosity responses to the brain. Spontaneous discharges of ganglion cells were predominantly suppressed by GABA (33 neurons out of 48), but 10 neurons were clearly excited. Similar effects were observed after addition of muscimol, but not of baclofen. Bicuculline reversed the GABA and muscimol induced inhibition or excitation. In 4 neurons of the luminosity type, GABA caused bidirectional, inhibitory and excitatory responses depending on the state of light- or dark-adaptation. These observations suggest a role of a GABAergic mechanism in the generation and transmission of luminosity responses in the trout pineal organ. It appears that GABA participates in the modulation of light sensitivity during light- and dark-adaptation processes and that this action is mediated by GABAA receptors.",Excluded
1551,"The excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist MK-801 prevents the hypersensitivity induced by spinal cord ischemia in the rat Protection by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 against transient spinal cord ischemia-induced hypersensitivity was studied in rats. The spinal ischemia was initiated by vascular occlusion resulting from the interaction between the photosensitizing dye Erythrosin B and an argon laser beam. The hypersensitivity, termed allodynia, where the animals reacted by vocalization to nonnoxious mechanical stimuli in the flank area, was consistently observed during several days after induction of the ischemia. Pretreatment with MK-801 (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, iv) 10 min before laser irradiation dose dependently prevented the occurrence of allodynia. The neuroprotective effect of MK-801 was not reduced by maintaining normal body temperature during and after irradiation. There was a significant negative correlation between the delay in the administration of MK-801 after irradiation and the protective effect of the drug. Histological examination revealed slight morphological damage in the spinal cord in 38% of control rats after 1 min of laser irradiation without pretreatment with MK-801. No morphological abnormalities were observed in rats after pretreatment with MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg).

2583,"Creation of endothelial-targeted adenoviral vectors for genetic engineering of the metastatic tumor microenvironment The endothelium is an attractive gene therapy target for metastatic cancer, providing access to systemic tumors. Previous work has focused on either viral entry/attachment (transductional targeting), or cell type specific enhancer promoter vector transgene expression regulation (transcriptional targeting). While previous studies demonstrated endothelial targeting, the tumor wide extent and transgene expression level quantification have been uncertain. Indeed, obtaining robust and stringent tumor expression has been challenging due to: insufficient transduction, focal rather than widespread intratumoral vascular expression, viral particle liver sequestration, and host preformed immunity. We developed a set of adenoviral vectors, containing 3 kb of the human ROBO4 enhancer/promoter, that are expressed at high levels throughout tumor vasculature. We now have three vectors representing four tiers of genetic modification. Transgenes encoding fluorescent proteins allowed us to quantify endothelial expression frequency by image analysis, and expression level using whole tissue Western blotting. Our first vector was Ad5.ROBO4. Compared with Ad5.CMV, Ad5.ROBO4 evidenced complete retargeting from hepatocytes to low-level expression in host organ and tumor endothelial cells. Warfarin-mediated hepatocyte detargeting produced a striking increase in tumor and bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial expression, without change in other host organs. Our second vector is Ad.RGD.H5/H3.ROBO4. Insertion of a cyclized RGD peptide in the fiber/knob HI loop engages enhanced tumor endothelial transduction via alphav/beta3 and alphav/beta5. Swapping hexon hypervariable regions responsible for Ad Type 5-Factor X binding with corresponding regions from serotype 3 enables marked diminution of hepatocyte sequestration. Use of the ROBO4 enhancer promoter produces high-level pan-intratumoral vascular expression particularly in cancers with markedly elevated VEGF production, such as orthotopic and metastatic renal cell carcinoma, orthotopic colonic liver metastases, and prostate cancer bone, brain, and liver metastases. Most striking, was enhancement of Ad.RGD.H5/H3.ROBO4 vector expression within interior tumor regions undergoing hypoxic necrosis; regions notoriously resistant to radiation or chemotherapies. Our third vector contains a polycistronic array, enabling triple transgene expression from a single vector within the tumor vasculature. Thus, we have panel of endothelial-targeted vectors with distinctive vascular tropism for use in cancers metastatic to individual host organs. These vectors enable expression of a palette of transgenes that can manipulate the tumor microenvironment to achieve metastatic growth inhibition alone, or ""staggered"" with chemo- or irradiation therapies.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 21 patients who were treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery, using either VMAT, DCAT or 3DCRT, were included in this study. The volume categorisation was seven patients each in <1, 1-2 and 2-3 cc volume. The treatment was planned with 6 MV FF and FFF beams using three different techniques: VMAT/Rapid Arc (RA) (RA_FF and RA_FFF), dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCA_FF and DCA_FFF) and 3DCRT (Static_FF and Static_FFF). Plans were evaluated for target coverage (V100%), conformity index, homogeneity index, dose gradient for 50% dose fall-off, total MU and MU/dose ratio [intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) factor], normal brain receiving >12 Gy dose, dose to the organ at risk (OAR), beam ON time and dose received by 12 cc of the brain. Result(s): The average target coverage for all plans, all tumour volumes (TVs) and delivery techniques is 96.4 +/- 4.5 (range 95.7 +/- 6.1-97.5 +/- 2.9%). The conformity index averaged over all volume ranges <1, 2, 3 cc> varies between 0.55 +/- 0.08 and 0.68 +/- 0.04 with minimum and maximum being exhibited by DCA_FFF for 1 cc and Static_FFF/RA_FFF for 3 cc tumours, respectively. Mean IMRT factor averaged over all volume ranges for RA_FF, DCA_FF and Static_FF are 3.5 +/- 0.8, 2.0 +/- 0.2 and 2.0 +/- 0.2, respectively; 50% dose fall-off gradient varies in the range of 0.33-0.42, 0.35-0.40 and 0.38-0.45 for 1, 2 and 3 cc tumours, respectively. Conclusion(s): This study establishes the equivalence between the FF and FFF beam models and different delivery techniques for stereotactic radiosurgery in small TVs in the range of <=1 to <=3 cc. Dose conformity, heterogeneity, dose fall-off characteristics and OAR doses show no or very little variation. FFF could offer only limited time advantage due to excess dose rate over an FF beam.

1724,"Oxidative stress and adult neurogenesis-Effects of radiation and superoxide dismutase deficiency Hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory and in spatial navigation. Production of new neurons that are functionally integrated into the hippocampal neuronal network is important for the maintenance of functional plasticity. In adults, production of new neurons in the hippocampus takes place in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of dentate gyrus. Neural progenitor/stem cells go through processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and maturation. This process is exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress, and perturbation in the redox balance in the neurogenic microenvironment can lead to reduced neurogenesis. Cranial irradiation is an effective treatment for primary and secondary brain tumors. However, even low doses of irradiation can lead to persistent elevation of oxidative stress and sustained suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are major antioxidant enzymes for the removal of superoxide radicals in different subcellular compartments. To identify the subcellular location where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated after cranial irradiation, different SOD deficient mice have been used to determine the effects of irradiation on hippocampal neurogenesis. The study results suggest that, regardless of the subcellular location, SOD deficiency leads to a significant reduction in the production of new neurons in the SGZ of hippocampal dentate gyrus. In exchange, the generation of new glial cells was significantly increased. The SOD deficient condition, however, altered the tissue response to irradiation, and SOD deficient mice were able to maintain a similar level of neurogenesis after irradiation while wild type mice showed a significant reduction in the production of new neurons.

2296,"Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain caused by acute radiation injuries Moderate to severe acute pain is a common consequence of fullcourse radiotherapy. Improved analgesics are needed, but therapeutic development requires an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie acute radiation-associated pain (RAP). Our preliminary data suggest that transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels on sensory neurons play important roles in RAP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of various Trp channels in acute RAP using a mouse model of oral radiation-induced mucositis. Mice underwent high dose single fraction lingual irradiation or sham irradiation. This resulted in glossitis that was most severe at 10-12 days postirradiation and resolved within 20 days. Micewere euthanized on days 1, 5, 11, 21, and 45 post-irradiation. Functional analysis of trigeminal ganglia neurons was assessed via calcium imaging; this revealed significantly increased proportions of neurons that were sensitive to capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist), histamine (TRPV4 partial agonist), or TNF-alpha (a general inflammatory marker). These changes were seen as early as 1-day post-irradiation and lasted until the 21st day. Via quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy, we documented Trpv1 overexpression in the trigeminal ganglia neurons of tongueirradiated mice on days 11 and 21. Together, these results indicate that both TRPV1 and TRPV4 are activated and upregulated, and contribute to the acute response of oral tissues to therapeutic irradiation. Thus, future studies should focus on assessing these two Trp channels as potential targets for RAP mitigation in human and animal cancer patients.",Included

Methods We designed a 6-month pilot Rapid Access Palliative Radiotherapy Program (RAPRP) brain metastases clinic. The main goals of the clinic were: (1) to provide timely consultation and treatment, (2) to provide multidisciplinary assessment and care, (3) to facilitate accrual of patients to research studies, and (4) to be a positive experience for patients. Team members included a radiation oncologist, radiation therapist, nurse practitioner, social worker (SW), occupational therapist (OT), and registered dietitian (RD). Patients underwent multidimensional assessment with patient-reported questionnaires and completed a patient satisfaction survey. Data were collected in a prospective database and collated in a standardized fashion with descriptive statistics recorded as percentages, medians, and ranges. Results The pilot brain metastases clinic ran weekly from August 5, 2009 to January 27, 2010. In total, 33 patients were seen. The median time from referral date to clinic date was 6 days, with 76% of patients seen within 1 week. Most patients (94%) started their radiotherapy on clinic day. Fifteen patients (45%) required assessment by a SW, 36% by an OT, and 33% by a RD. Ninety-one percent of patients participated in a research study. Eighty-six percent of patients reported being very satisfied with the clinic experience, and 97% would recommend the clinic to a patient in a similar situation. Conclusions The pilot RAPRP Brain Metastases Clinic was successful in providing patients with timely and multidisciplinary care and will continue beyond the pilot phase.

2577,"Primary central nervous system lymphoma Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare and aggressive extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), confined to the brain, eyes, spinal cord or leptomeninges without systemic involvement. Overall prognosis, diagnosis and management of PCNSL differ from other types of NHL. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment are vital to improving clinical outcomes. PCNSL is responsive to radiation therapy, however whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) inadequately controls the disease when used alone and its delayed neurotoxicity causes neurocognitive impairment, especially in elderly patients. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based induction chemotherapy with or without autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or reduced-dose WBRT leads to durable disease control and less neurotoxicity. The optimal treatment has yet to be defined, however HD-MTX-based induction chemotherapy is considered standard for newly diagnosed PCNSL. Ongoing randomized trials address the role of rituximab, and of consolidative treatment using ASCT or reduced-dose WBRT. Despite high tumor response rates to initial treatment, many patients have relapsing disease with very poor prognosis. The optimal treatment for refractory or relapsed PCNSL is poorly defined. The choice of salvage treatment depends on age, previous treatment and response, performance status and comorbidities at the time of relapse. Novel therapeutics targeting underlying tumor biology include small molecule inhibitors of B-cell receptor, cereblon, and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, and immunotherapy programmed cell death 1 receptor inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cells.

Although there are few reports on brain MT, there is a growing interest in the role of MT in brain. There have been no publications to date on MT synthesis in the human central nervous system (CNS) following exposure to ionizing radiation. In the present study, primary human CNS cultures were used to examine the effect of ionizing radiation on MT mRNA and protein synthesis. In the same cultures, the neuroprotective effects of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd)-induced MT synthesis from high-dose radiation were also examined.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary, serum-free, human CNS cultures were exposed to 30 or 60 Gy gamma-rays. The total MT protein was then measured by a Cd-heme assay, and mRNA for MT-II and MT-III was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cytotoxicity was measured by LDH release and apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis. Sublethal neuroglial injury was assessed morphologically using specific astrocytic (glial fibrillary acidic protein--GFAP) and neuronal (microtubule-associated protein 2--MAP2) immunohistochemical markers.RESULTS: The total MT protein content was increased 12h after exposure to 30Gy. The increase in MT content in response to 60Gy was not statistically significant. MT-II mRNA levels increased at 3 and 6h after exposure to 30Gy gamma-rays, with a maximum expression at 12-24 h. MT-III mRNA was not significantly affected. Exposure to 60 Gy, but not 30 Gy, caused a marked increase in LDH release. Cells exposed to 30 Gy or less showed some apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis, while exposure to 60 Gy resulted in a DNA smear confirmed by LDH assays. Preinduction of MT by 5 microM Cd or 100 microM Zn resulted in a significant reduction in radiation-induced LDH release. Morphological evaluations revealed that Cd or Zn preincubation led to relative preservation of MAP2 staining and GFAP.CONCLUSION: Both MT protein and MT-II mRNA can be induced in human CNS cells by ionizing radiation. Furthermore, induction of MT synthesis with Zn and Cd can protect human CNS cells from radiation-induced cytocidal and sublethal injuries. Both findings have implications in the development of strategies to protect human CNS tissue from damage during radiotherapy.",Included

Some brain metastases demonstrate significant peritumoral edema; radiation may induce cerebral edema or worsening preexisting edema. This study was conducted to evaluate the imaging and neurobehavioral outcomes in patients with preexisting peritumoral edema who then undergo GKS.METHODS: Between August 2003 and January 2008, 63 cases of brain metastasis with significant peritumoral edema (> 20 cm(3)) were prospectively studied. The study inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a single metastatic lesion with significant edema (perilesional edema signal volume on FLAIR > 20 cm(3)); and 2) inclusion of only 1 lesion > 20 cm(3) in the study (in cases of multiple lesions noted on FLAIR images). All patients received MR imaging with pulse sequences including T1-weighted imaging and FLAIR with or without contrast and T2-weighted imaging at an interval of 3 months. A neurological assessment and Brain Cancer Module (BCM-20) questionnaire were obtained every 2-3 months. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used for analysis of survival and associated factors.RESULTS: At the time of GKS, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 70 (range 50-90), and the mean BCM-20 score was 45.5 +/- 6.1. The mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) was 5.2 +/- 4.6 cm(3) with corresponding T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volumes of 59.25 +/- 37.3 and 62.1 +/- 38.8 cm(3), respectively (R(2) = 0.977, p < 0.001). The mean edema index (volume of peritumoral edema/tumor volume) was 17.5 +/- 14.5. The mean peripheral and maximum GKS doses were 17.4 +/- 2.3 and 35 +/- 4.7 Gy, respectively. The median survival was 11 months. The longer survival was related to KPS scores >or= 70 (p = 0.008), age < 65 years (p = 0.022), and a reduction of > 6 in BCM-20 score (p = 0.007), but survival was not related to preexisting edema or tumor volume. A reduction in BCM-20 score of > 6 was related to decreased volume in T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging (p < 0.001). Thirty-eight (79.2%) of 48 patients demonstrated decreased tumor volume and accompanied by decreased T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volume. Eight (16.7%) of the 48 patients exhibited increased or stable tumor volume. A margin dose > 18 Gy was more likely to afford tumor reduction and resolution of peritumoral edema (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively). However, prior external-beam radiation therapy correlated with worsened preexisting peritumoral edema (p = 0.013) and longer maintenance of corticosteroids (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients demonstrating a reduction in the BCM-20 score > 6, age < 65 years, and KPS score >or= 70 exhibited longer survival. Significant preexisting edema did not influence the tumor response or clinical outcome. The resolution of edema was related to better quality of life but not to longer survival.",Excluded

Cutting of bone with ultrasonic tools is a relatively new technique replacing conventional procedures in neuro-, dental and orthopaedic surgeries, due to its precision and safety. In this article, the level of forces produced during a chisel-like tool penetration in a fresh cortical bone is studied. The obtained force data are analysed for both conventional cutting and ultrasonically assisted cutting. Through a series of experiments, it was demonstrated that the depth of cut and parameters of ultrasonic oscillations affected the level of cutting force, the former being the main factor in both types of cutting. It was found that the tool penetration force was decreased with an increase in the ultrasonic frequency or amplitude and was not affected by the cutting speed.

However, the established management paradigm of platinum-based chemotherapy has reached an efficacy plateau. A modest survival improvement, approximately 5%, was witnessed with the addition of cranial or thoracic radiation to systemic chemotherapy. Other strategies to improve outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in the last two decades have met with minimal success. The substitution of irinotecan for etoposide in the frontline treatment of SCLC achieved significant efficacy benefit in Japanese patients, but similar benefit could not be reproduced in other patient populations. Salvage treatment for recurrent or progressive SCLC is particularly challenging, where topotecan remains the only agent with regulatory approval to date. Ongoing evaluation of biologic agents targeting angiogenesis, sonic hedgehog pathway, DNA repair pathway, and immune checkpoint modulators hold some promise for improved outcome in SCLC. It is hoped that the coming decade will witness the application of new molecular biology and genomic research techniques to improve our understanding of SCLC biology and identification of molecular subsets that can be targeted appropriately using established and emerging biological agents similar to the accomplishments of the last decade with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

1335,"Utility of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Modern Era with Magnetic Resonance Imaging Surveillance Aims: To retrospectively analyse the impact of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) on survival and intracranial progression in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) in the modern era of widespread magnetic resonance imaging brain screening. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with LS-SCLC treated within our network between 2009 and 2020 who responded to initial therapy were stratified by receipt of PCI and stage of disease. A propensity score match analysis was carried out for stage II-III patients. Overall and neurological survival were defined as time to death and presumed death due to uncontrolled intracranial disease, respectively. Brain metastasis-free survival and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival were defined as freedom from intracranial progression and symptomatic intracranial progression, respectively. The effect of PCI on these outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Result(s): In total, 243 (69.6%) of 349 patients received PCI. On multivariate analysis in the propensity matched stage II-III cohort, PCI was a significant predictor of improved neurological survival (hazard ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.65; P = 0.01), brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.51; P < 0.01) and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.55; P < 0.01), but not improved overall survival. Two-year neurological survival estimates within the propensity matched cohort were 96.8% (95% confidence interval 87.6-99.2%) with PCI and 77.2% (95% confidence interval 63.0-86.4%) without PCI and 1- and 2-year estimates of incidence of brain metastases were 3.9% (95% confidence interval 1.3-11.7%) and 11.7% (95% confidence interval 5.6-23.5%) in the PCI group and 31.6% (95% confidence interval 22.1-43.9%) and 40.4% (95% confidence interval 29.2-54.0%) in the no PCI group, respectively. Conclusion(s): In the modern era of magnetic resonance imaging screening, PCI was associated with reduced incidence of intracranial progression in patients with stage II-III LS-SCLC who respond to initial therapy. This, importantly, translated to a decreased risk of neurological death within our propensity matched cohort, without significant improvement in overall survival.

Seventy-two Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were divided as follows: Group I: control group, 24 rats clinically evaluated during six weeks; Group II: evaluation of acute side-effects (two-week follow-up period), 24 irradiated (20 Gy) rats; and Group III: evaluation of subacute side-effects (six-week follow-up period), 24 irradiated (20 Gy) rats. Variables included clinical assessments, weight, vascular permeability (arterial and venous), mortality and histological studies. No significant differences were observed between groups with respect to the variables studied. Significant differences were observed between groups I vs II-III regarding survival rates and histological changes to arteries, veins and nerves. Rat body weights showed progressive increases in all groups, and the mortality rate of the present model is 10.4% compared with 30-40% in the previous models.

855,"The discovery and development of new potential antioxidant agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases Introduction: Several neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) including Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases have had associations with the oxidative process and free radical damage. Consequently, in past decades, several natural and synthetic antioxidants have been assessed as therapeutic agents but have shown limitations in bioavailability, metabolic susceptibility and permeability to the blood brain barrier. Given these issues, medicinal chemists are hard at work to modify/improve the chemical structures of these antioxidants, thereby improving their efficacy. Areas covered: In this review, the authors critically analyze several biological mechanisms involved in the generation of free radicals. Additionally, they analyze free radicals' role in the generation of oxidative stress and in the progression of many NDs. Further, the authors review a collection of natural and synthetic antioxidants, their role as free radical scavengers along with their mechanisms of action and their potential for preventing neurodegenerative diseases. Expert opinion: So far, preclinical studies on several antioxidants have shown promise for treating NDs, despite their limitations. The authors do highlight the lack of the adequate animal models for preclinical assessment and this does hinder further progression into clinical trials. Further studies are necessary to fully investigate the potential of these antioxidants as ND therapeutic options. Â© Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of standard RT on normal brain tissue via in vivo neuroimaging in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 146 newly diagnosed NPC patients who were treated with standard RT were longitudinally followed up at multiple time points during the first year post-RT, with 19 comparable healthy controls followed up in parallel serving as normal age-related benchmarks. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used to evaluate longitudinal brain white matter tract changes in NPC patients. The relationships between RT-related white matter changes, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive impairment were also assessed.RESULTS: Bilateral cingulate angular bundle (CAB) fibers had progressive diffusion reduction [radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity] over time (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) in NPC patients during the first year after RT. RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with longitudinal atrophy of the ipsilateral hippocampus (P = 0.033). Additionally, RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with progressive cognitive impairment in NPC patients post-RT (P = 0.048).CONCLUSION: We present evidence of progressive RT-associated changes in the bilateral CAB in NPC patients, which may underlie RT-related cognitive impairment. These findings illustrate that the use of white matter tract alterations as potential biomarkers to detect RT-related brain injury in NPC patients may be useful for better understanding the pathogenesis of RT-induced cognitive decline.",Included

The mean latency times for the development of myelopathy after irradiation with the thermal neutron beam-alone, or in combination with BPA or BSH, were 23.7 +/- 0.3, 21.8 +/- 0.4 and 19.6 +/- 0.4 weeks, respectively. The radiation-induced lesion in the spinal cord was characterised by white matter necrosis. Due to the variations in the microdistribution of different neutron capture agents in body tissues, it was considered inappropriate to define the biological effectiveness of the high LET radiation, resulting from the <sup>10</sup>B(n,alpha)<sup>7</sup>Li neutron capture reaction, relative to photon radiation, using the term 'relative biological effectiveness' (RBE). The term 'compound biological effectiveness' (CBE) factor was used as an alternative.

Expressed as total physical absorbed doses these values were 13.6 +/- 0.4, 30.3 +/- 2.7 and 13.8 +/- 0.5 Gy after irradiation with the thermal neutron beam alone, or the thermal neutron beam in combination with BSH or BPA, respectively. The RBE of the thermal neutron beam was 1.4 +/- 0.04. The microdistribution of the two neutron capture agents played a crucial role in the determination of the overall biological effect, after thermal neutron activation. BSH, which is excluded from the CNS parenchyma by the blood brain barrier, had a low CBE factor value of 0.46 +/- 0.5. BPA, on the other hand, which crosses the blood brain barrier and distributes in the CNS parenchyma, had a higher CBE factor value of 1.33 +/- 0.16.",Included
1506,"Combined modality therapy including intraoperative electron irradiation for locally recurrent colorectal cancer PURPOSE: To evaluate survival, relapse patterns, and prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer relapse treated with curative-intent therapy, including intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: From April 1981 through January 2008, 607 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer received IOERT as a component of treatment. IOERT was preceded or followed by external radiation (median dose, 45.5 Gy) in 583 patients (96%). Resection was classified as R0 in 227 (37%), R1 in 224 (37%), and R2 in 156 (26%). The median IOERT dose was 15 Gy (range, 7.5-30 Gy).RESULTS: Median overall survival was 36 months. Five- and 10-year survival rates were 30% and 16%, respectively. Survival estimates at 5 years were 46%, 27%, and 16% for R0, R1, and R2 resection, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that R0 resection, no prior chemotherapy, and more recent treatment (in the second half of the series) were associated with improved survival. The 3-year cumulative incidence of central, local, and distant relapse was 12%, 23%, and 49%, respectively. Central and local relapse were more common in previously irradiated patients and in those with subtotal resection. Toxicity Grade 3 or higher partially attributable to IOERT was observed in 66 patients (11%). Neuropathy was observed in 94 patients (15%) and was more common with IOERT doses exceeding 12.5 Gy.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival and disease control was achievable in patients with locally recurrent colorectal cancer.

1581,"Classifying the risk of ionizing radiation exposure after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Learning Objectives: We hypothesized that patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) could be classified by their risk of receiving potentially harmful ionizing radiation exposure (PHIRE) from diagnostic tests and medical procedures. Method(s): The EMR of all patients admitted to our institution with aSAH from 01/2012-12/2015 were retrospectively evaluated using an IRB-approved protocol for patient-specific and disease-specific data. Patients were excluded if they died prior to discharge. Total effective dose of ionizing radiation (TEDIR) was calculated from published data. PHIRE was considered to have occurred in patients with TEDIR> 50 mSV, the annual radiation exposure limit for radiation workers. A multivariate classification tree was created to predict PHIRE risk groups. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk of PHIRE between the risk groups. Result(s): Data were collected from 108 aSAH patients. The mean TEDIR was 47.8 mSv. After development of the multivariate classification tree, the tree was pruned to include only ventriculostomy (EVD), Hunt/Hess score (HH), and aneurysm location, according to normal statistical conventions. Patients who did not have an ventriculostomy (EVD) were at low risk for PHIRE (N = 2/35, (5.7%)). Patients with an EVD + HH 2 + anterior circulation aneurysms were at moderate risk for PHIRE (N = 17/42, 40.5%). (OR = 11.2, p = 0.002). Patients with an EVD + HH < 2 or EVD + HH 2 + posterior circulation aneurysms were at high risk for PHIRE (N = 23/31, 74.2%) (OR = 47.4, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In this study, aSAH patients were categorized into low, moderate and high risk groups of PHIRE according to three factors: EVD, HH, and aneurysm location. These groups likely represent differential baseline neurologic status and risk of neurologic complications. Alternative diagnostic or therapeutic modalities should be utilized, when possible, for patients in the high-risk group and should be considered for patients in the moderate-risk group. Future research should validate these risk groups in larger patient samples and across multiple medical centers.",Excluded

The purpose of our study was to determine the potential of echo planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting subacute radiation induced injury to the normal brain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with brain metastases and three patients with lung cancer underwent cranial irradiation. These patients were subjected to 3D-EPSI and DTI at two time points (pre-radiation, and 1 month post-irradiation). Parametric maps of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated and co-registered to post-contrast T1-weighted images. Normal appearing gray-matter and white-matter regions were compared between the two time points to assess sub-acute effects of radiation using independent sample t-tests.RESULTS: Significantly increased MD (P = .02), Cho/Cr (P = .02) and a trend towards a decrease in NAA/Cr (P = .06) was observed from the hippocampus. Significant decrease in FA (P = .02) from the centrum-semiovale and a significant increase in MD (P = .04) and Cho/Cr (P = .02) from genu of corpus-callosum was also observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that 3D-EPSI and DTI may provide quantitative measures of radiation induced injury to the normal brain.",Excluded
1923,"Non-thermal resistive switching in Mott insulator nanowires Resistive switching can be achieved in a Mott insulator by applying current/voltage, which triggers an insulator-metal transition (IMT). This phenomenon is key for understanding IMT physics and developing novel memory elements and brain-inspired technology. Despite this, the roles of electric field and Joule heating in the switching process remain controversial. Using nanowires of two archetypal Mott insulators-VO<inf>2</inf> and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> we unequivocally show that a purely non-thermal electrical IMT can occur in both materials. The mechanism behind this effect is identified as field-assisted carrier generation leading to a doping driven IMT. This effect can be controlled by similar means in both VO<inf>2</inf> and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, suggesting that the proposed mechanism is generally applicable to Mott insulators. The energy consumption associated with the non-thermal IMT is extremely low, rivaling that of state-of-the-art electronics and biological neurons.

Method(s): Nineteen patients harboring twenty-two brain metastases treated with SRS were imaged with dynamic susceptibility magnetic resonance imaging (DSC MRI) at baseline, 1 week and 1 month post SRS. Relative cerebral blood volume and flow (rCBV and rCBF) ratios were evaluated outside of tumor within a combined region of interest (ROI) and separately within gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) ROIs. Threedimensional dose distribution from each SRS plan was divided into six regions: (1) <2 Gy; (2) 2-5 Gy; (3) 5-10 Gy; (4) 10-12 Gy; (5) 12-16 Gy; and (6) >16 Gy. rCBV and rCBF ratio differences between baseline, 1 week and 1 month were compared. Best linear fit plots quantified normal tissue dose-dependency. Result(s): Significant rCBV ratio increases were present between baseline and 1 month for all ROIs and dose ranges except for WM ROI receiving <2 Gy. rCBV ratio for all ROIs was maximally increased from baseline to 1 month with the greatest changes occurring within the 5-10 Gy dose range (53.1%). rCBF ratio was maximally increased from baseline to 1 month for all ROIs within the 5-10 Gy dose range (33.9-45.0%). Both rCBV and rCBF ratios were most elevated within GM ROIs. A weak, positive but not significant association between dose, rCBV and rCBF ratio was demonstrated. Progressive rCBV and rCBF ratio increased with dose up to 10 Gy at 1 month. Conclusion(s): Normal tissue response following SRS can be characterized by dose, tissue, and time specific increases in rCBV and rCBF ratio. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2014.",Excluded

3243,"Impact of image denoising on image quality, quantitative parameters and sensitivity of ultra-low-dose volume perfusion CT imaging OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of denoising on ultra-low-dose volume perfusion CT (ULD-VPCT) imaging in acute stroke.METHODS: Simulated ULD-VPCT data sets at 20 % dose rate were generated from perfusion data sets of 20 patients with suspected ischemic stroke acquired at 80 kVp/180 mAs. Four data sets were generated from each ULD-VPCT data set: not-denoised (ND); denoised using spatiotemporal filter (D1); denoised using quanta-stream diffusion technique (D2); combination of both methods (D1 + D2). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured in the resulting 100 data sets. Image quality, presence/absence of ischemic lesions, CBV and CBF scores according to a modified ASPECTS score were assessed by two blinded readers.RESULTS: SNR and qualitative scores were highest for D1 + D2 and lowest for ND (all p <= 0.001). In 25 % of the patients, ND maps were not assessable and therefore excluded from further analyses. Compared to original data sets, in D2 and D1 + D2, readers correctly identified all patients with ischemic lesions (sensitivity 1.0, kappa 1.0). Lesion size was most accurately estimated for D1 + D2 with a sensitivity of 1.0 (CBV) and 0.94 (CBF) and an inter-rater agreement of 1.0 and 0.92, respectively.CONCLUSION: An appropriate combination of denoising techniques applied in ULD-VPCT produces diagnostically sufficient perfusion maps at substantially reduced dose rates as low as 20 % of the normal scan.KEY POINTS: Perfusion-CT is an accurate tool for the detection of brain ischemias. The high associated radiation doses are a major drawback of brain perfusion CT. Decreasing tube current in perfusion CT increases image noise and deteriorates image quality.

The aim of the study was to analyze the positive margin cases in our Breast Unit, risk factors for inadequate margin and the impact of positive margin on outcomes after breast-conserving therapy. Material(s) and Method(s): 107 women with invasive breast cancer (T1-2, N0-2, M0) diagnosed between 2005-2010, who underwent breastconserving surgery(BCS) as first surgery, were retrospectively selected from the Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital Breast Unit Registry. A positive resection margin was defined as a microscopic invasive or in situ tumor at the cutting edge in permanent pathologic reports. Result(s): The mean tumor size was 1.65 cm in the positive margin group and 1.68 cm in the other group(p > 0.893). 13 of 107 (12.1%) had positive margins at initial resection. Of these patients 4(30.7%)had involved caudal margin, 2 (15.3%) cranial margin, 2 (15.3%) medial margin, 2(15.3%) deep margin and 1 (7.6%) lateral margin, there were insufficient data available about the type of margin in 2 cases. 8 (61.5%) had an invasive carcinoma at the margins and in other cases carcinoma in situ was detected. 4 (30.7%) underwent additional surgery-mastectomy, to achieve negative margins. Postoperative radiation was performed for 12 (92.3%) patients. 7 (53.8%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with inadequate margins had ER positive tumors in 76.5% vs. 47.3% in other group, PR positive tumors in 46.8% vs. 52.3% in other, HER 2/neu negative tumors in 76.9% vs. 56.2% in other. Patients with a positive margins at the initial resection showed higher lobular histology rate (15.3% vs. 6.4%), incidence of multiple ipsilateral tumors (23.1% vs. 15.4%), presens of intraductal component (76.9% vs. 65.1%), but these differences between two groups were no statistically significant. 73.1% of all patients were tested for the two common founder mutaions in BRCA1(4153delA and 5382insC).

Attenuation correction factors range from 4-5 in brain studies to 50-100 in whole body measurements. This report gives an overview of the different methods of determining the attenuation correction factors by transmission measurements using an external positron emitting source. The long-lived generator nuclide 68Ge/68Ga is commonly used for this purpose. The additional patient dose from the transmission source is usually a small fraction of the dose due to the subsequent emission measurement. Ring-shaped transmission sources as well as rotating point or line sources are employed in modern positron tomographs. By masking a rotating line or point source, random and scattered events in the transmission scans can be effectively suppressed. The problems of measured attenuation correction are discussed: transmission/emission mismatch, random and scattered event contamination, counting statistics, transmission/emission scatter compensation, transmission scan after administration of activity to the patient.

The same tracer has been used in patients with neurological disease to assess the state of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system at a post-ganglionic level that is altered in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), even without clinical signs of dysautonomia, and normal in other Parkinsonism such as multisystem atrophy (MSA). Both cardiological and neurological pts are pretreated with Lugol's oral solution and/or potassium perchlorate to prevent thyroid uptake of unlabeled 123I and to limit the thyroid radiation exposure. However, despite the inhibition of the iodide pump a thyroid visualization is frequently observed in MIBG scans in pts imaged for cardiac or neurological disorders. Recently a pt with hyperthyroidism, normal calcitonin level and CHF came to our observation for MIBG imaging. There was a high thyroid uptake of the tracer despite he was on therapy with Amiodarone. A scan with 123I-Iodide confirmed the absence of any uptake. Aim of the study was the evaluation of the thyroid uptake in pts undergone to 123I-MIBG scan for CHF and movement disorders. Method(s): We have reviewed the 123I-MIBG scintigraphies of 57 pts recruited in three different centres (Brescia, Castelfranco Veneto and Veruno) who were imaged at 15' and 4 h and in whom the thyroid was included in the field of view of the thorax. 42 pts underwent MIBG imaging for cardiological purposes and 15 for neurological disorders. 2/3 centres pretreated the pts with Lugol's oral solution and/or potassium perchlorate and one centre did not and the pts were referred as control group. The following parameters were evaluated. Tracer wash out from heart (HWO) and thyroid (TWO), heart to mediastinum ratio (H/M), thyroid to mediastinum ratio (T/M) at 15' and 4 h Results: In the cardiac pts HWO was 23 +/- 7.2 % and TWO was 11.4 +/- 8.2 % (p<.0001). The TWO was 12.2 +/- 13.4 % in centres 1 and 2 and 10.05 +/- 8.97 % in centre 3 (control group), p = n.s. The T/M ratio was 1.37 +/- 0.17 in Centre 1-2 and 1.3 +/- 0.35 in Centre 3 p = n.s. (Control group- no pretreatment). In neurological pts the HWO was 26 +/- 8.1 % and the TWO was 20,32c6,41, p<.05. The difference in TWO was statistically significant (p<.01) between cardiological and neurological pts, whereas the HWO was not (p = ns). The 4 h H/M was 1.49 +/- 0.23 in cardiological pts and 1.4 +/- 0.39 in neurological pts (p = n.s.) The 4 h T/M was 1.33 +/- 0.3 in cardiological pts and 1.15 +/- 0.13 in neurological pts (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the thyroid visualization in MIBG imaging is not related to accumulation of 123I-iodide but to 123IMIBG uptake as an expression of thyroid sympathetic innervation. On the basis of our observation pretreatment with Lugol's oral solution and/or potassium perchlorate is therefore not justified and the procedure guidelines should be revised. Different values of TWO and T/M ratio in cardiological and neurological disorders probably express a different attitude of thyroid dopaminergic receptors in more generalized sympathetic disorder in Parkinson's disease rather than an activation of the sympatho-adrenergic system in CHF.",Excluded
1668,"N-desmethylclozapine an M1 receptor agonist enhances nitric oxide's cardiac vagal facilitation in the isolated innervated rat right atrium We have previously determined that neuronal nitric oxide (NO) may partly mediate its established cholinergic effect via activation of muscarinic type 1 (M1) receptors located at the preganglionic/postganglionic synapse. In this series of experiments we set out to confirm this finding using an M1 agonist. Experiments were carried out on the isolated vagally innervated right atrium in the presence of atenolol (4 microM). The right vagus was stimulated at 4, 8, 16, 32 Hz; pulse duration 1 ms at 20 V for 20 s and the effect on cardiac interval (ms) assessed. N-desmethylclozapine (100 nM), a potent M1 agonist, enhanced the vagally induced increase in cardiac interval, a lower concentration of 50 nM had no significant effect on cardiac interval. This effect was prevented by pre-treatment of the atria with the neuronal NO synthase inhibitor 1 (2-trifluoromethylphenyl)imidazole (TRIM) at 0.14 mM. The vagal stimulation protocol was repeated in order to rule out a reduction in vagal effectiveness which may have been due to the experimental stimulation protocol used in this study. TRIM (0.14 mM) alone causes a small but significant attenuation of the vagally induced increase in cardiac interval. These results show that agonism of M1 receptors on cardiac vagal preganglionic fibres enhances vagal cardiac effects which can be prevented by a neuronal NO inhibitor.",Excluded

2034,"The role of radiation and chemotherapy in adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas: results from the National Cancer Database INTRODUCTION: Surgical resection of high-grade brainstem gliomas is challenging and treatment mostly involves radiation and chemotherapy. In this study, we utilized registry data to determine prognostic features and impact of chemotherapy and radiation on overall survival.METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried from 2006 to 2015 for adult cases with histologically confirmed high-grade brainstem glioma. Covariates including patient demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics and treatment parameters were captured. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify predictors of survival.RESULTS: A total of 422 patients were analyzed. Most patients (66.6%) underwent postoperative radiation with chemotherapy, 9.2% underwent radiation alone, while the remaining had no postoperative treatment (24.2%). Overall median survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.8-12). Survival was longer (p < 0.001) in the radiation + chemotherapy group (median: 14.2 months, 95% CI 11.7-17.1) compared to radiation alone (median: 5.7 months, 95% CI 3.7-12) and no postoperative treatment (median: 1.8 months, 95% CI 1.4-4) groups. In multivariable analysis, increasing age was associated with worse survival (HR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.47-2.37, p < 0.001), whereas radiation + chemotherapy was associated with lower mortality compared to radiation alone (HR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98, p = 0.038). In subgroup analysis, postoperative chemotherapy with radiation was associated with significant survival benefit compared to radiation alone for grade IV (HR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76, p = 0.003), but not for grade III tumors (HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.48-1.58, p = 0.65).CONCLUSION: Analysis from a national registry illustrated the effectiveness of radiation with chemotherapy for adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas, particularly grade IV. Further research should identify specific patient profiles and molecular subgroups that are more likely to benefit from multimodality therapy.",Included
989,"Pions and pig skin: preclinical evaluation of RBE for early and late damage The skin of 50 pigs has been irradiated with negative pi mesons and with X rays in order to determine the RBE for early epidermal and later dermal damage. Late fibrosis was not studied. Four, 7, 9 and 10 fractions were used. An estimate of the RBE was made from the reactions on each pig for both early and late damage so that interanimal variability would be avoided. The data were also averaged to obtain mean dose response curves. There was no tendency for higher RBE's for late than for early skin damage. These pig studies have demonstrated an RBE of about 1.5 for early epidermal reactions and a slightly lower RBE (approximately 1.4) for later dermal damage in the same animals. This indicates that at doses of about 2.0 to 3.5 Gy pions, the medium wave skin damage is unlikely to be more severe than would be predicted from the early skin reactions and the accumulated clinical experience with X rays. However, if the trend to a steeper slope for the RBE versus dose per fraction for late injury is correct, as indicated by other published studies a relative increase in the late injury might be expected if much lower doses per fraction are used. The present clinical studies at Vancouver using 15 X 2.1 Gy pions indicate that an RBE of 1.5 is appropriate for epithelia, brain and colorectum.",Included
3171,"Iodinated contrast agent time course in human brain metastasis: A study for synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy clinical trials Purpose/Objective(s): Synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy (SSRT) is an innovative treatment combining the selective accumulation of heavy elements in tumors with stereotactic irradiations using monochromatic medium energy x-rays from a synchrotron source. Phase I/II clinical trials on brain metastasis are underway using venous infusion of iodinated contrast agents. The radiation dose enhancement depends on the amount of iodine in the tumor and its time course. Quantitative, post-infusion iodine bio-distribution and associated brain perfusion parameters were studied in human brain metastasis as key parameters for treatment feasibility and quality. The reproducibility of iodine concentrations between the recruitment day and the treatment day was assessed in order to predict dose errors. Materials/Methods: Twelve patients received an intravenous bolus of iodinated contrast agent (40 mL, 4 mL/s), followed by a steady-state infusion (160 mL, 0.5 mL/s) in order to ensure stable intratumoral amounts of iodine during the treatment. Absolute iodine concentrations and quantitative perfusion maps were derived from 40 multi-slice dynamic conventional CT images of the brain (recruitment day) or from quantitative synchrotron radiation CT (treatment day). For three of these patients, iodine concentrations reached in the tumor were compared between the recruitment day and the treatment day (~ 10 days interval). Result(s): The post-infusion mean intratumoral iodine concentration (over thirty minutes) reached 1.94 +/- 0.12 mg/mL. Reasonable correlations were obtained between these concentrations and the permeability surface area product and the cerebral blood volume. Iodine concentrations were reproducible leading to dose errors in the radiotherapy standards. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study of contrast agent biodistribution versus time in brain metastasis. The study demonstrates that suitable and stable amounts of iodine can be reached in brain metastasis for SSRT treatment. Moreover, the associated perfusion measurements provide useful information for the patient recruitment and management processes.",Excluded
516,"Physiological changes in glucose differentially modulate the excitability of hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone and orexin neurons in situ The physiological signaling mechanisms that link normal variations in body energy status to the activity of arousal- and metabolism-regulating brain centers are not well understood. The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin/hypocretin types of neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) exert opposing effects on arousal and metabolism. We examined whether shifts in brain extracellular glucose that correspond to physiological changes in blood glucose can alter the electrical output of neurochemically and biophysically defined LH cells in mouse brain slices. Here, we show that physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose dose-dependently enhance the electrical excitability of MCH neurons by inducing depolarization and increasing membrane resistance. We also demonstrate that the same physiological shifts in glucose have the opposite effects on the electrical activity of orexin neurons. We propose that these direct actions of glucose on the arousal- and metabolism-regulating LH neurons play a key role in the translation of normal variations in body energy resources into appropriate changes in arousal and metabolism.",Excluded

It was concluded that following 9.0 Gy <sup>60</sup>Co-gamma irradiation, the serotonin amount significantly decreased in the brain after 1 hr of irradiation, while this amount increased in metabolite which might in our supposition be the result of the metabolising enzyme - the monoaminoxidase activity increase.

3318,"Defining survival for patients with breast cancer with brain metastases Background: Brain metastases account for 100,000 to 170,000 cases per year in the U.S, the bulk being from breast and lung primaries. About 10-15% of breast cancer patients develop brain metastases and historically, their survival has been poor. Introduction of novel chemotherapeutic and biologic agents and newer radiation techniques in the past decade has led to better control of systemic disease raising the possibility of increasing incidence of brain metastases as well as better control of CNS disease. The aim of this study was to determine the survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases in our practice in the last 10 years. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart analysis and we analyzed the charts of 18 patients with breast cancer who had developed brain metastases. The parameters analyzed included patient age at diagnosis of breast cancer and at development of brain metastases, receptor status and various treatment modalities used to control local as well as Metastatic disease. Result(s): The median survival time after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and the number of brain metastases was 55 months. The time to death was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model, adjusting for age and number of brain metastases. Age at diagnosis of breast cancer was significant with a p-value of 0.007 and the number of brain metastases was not significant with a p-value of 0.55. Using the Log Rank test, median survival for Her2neu positive patients was 71 months and for Her2neu negative patients was 58 months with a non-significant p value of 0.86. Review of treatment modalities revealed that six patients underwent surgical removal of metastases and 12 patients received WBRT. Average number of systemic treatments used was 6.7 including chemotherapeutic, biological and hormonal agents. Conclusion(s): In our practice, the overall survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases was found to be 55 months after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and number of brain metastases. Overall survival did not vary significantly with the number of brain metastases and Her2neu receptor status.",Excluded
2770,"Effects of Radiotherapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma: a retrospective analysis of a Single Institution BACKGROUND: Palliative irradiation of osteolytic lesions is a considerable component in the treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of irradiation in these patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 153 patients with multiple myeloma who were admitted to our department between 1989 and 2013. According to the staging system of Durie & Salmon 116 patients were classified as stage III. 107/153 patients were treated with radiotherapy of at least one and up to 6 bony lesions at different times. In order to evaluate the effect of local radiotherapy on pain relief and bone recalcification a uni- and multivariate analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model to correct for multiple measurements. Complete information on dose, fractionation and volume of radiotherapy was available from 81 patients treated in 136 target volumes for pain relief, and from 69 patients treated in 108 target volumes for recalcification. Total radiation doses varied between 8 Gy to 50 Gy (median dose 25 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions, 5 times a week).RESULTS: Radiotherapy resulted in complete local pain relief in 31% and partial local pain relief in 54% of the patients. In the univariate analysis, higher total radiation doses (p = 0.023) and higher age (p = 0.014) at the time of radiotherapy were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of pain relief, whereas no significant association was detected for concurrent systemic treatment, type and stage of myeloma and location of bone lesions. The same variables were independent predictors for pain relief in the multivariate analysis. Recalcification was observed in 48% of irradiated bone lesions. In the uni- and multivariate analysis higher radiation doses were significantly associated (p = 0.048) with an increased likelihood of recalcification. Side effects of radiotherapy were generally mild.CONCLUSIONS: Higher total biological radiation doses were associated with better pain relief and recalcification in this retrospective evaluation of multiple myeloma patients. In addition, in the elderly the therapeutic measures appear to develop a better analgesic effect.",Included

213,"Extraction of optical properties and prediction of light distribution in rat brain tissue Predicting the distribution of light inside any turbid media, such as biological tissue, requires detailed information about the optical properties of the medium, including the absorption and scattering coefficients and the anisotropy factor. Particularly, in biophotonic applications where photons directly interact with the tissue, this information translates to system design optimization, precision in light delivery, and minimization of unintended consequences, such as phototoxicity or photobleaching. In recent years, optogenetics has opened up a new area in deep brain stimulation with light and the method is widely adapted by researchers for the study of the brain circuitries and the dynamics of neurological disorders. A key factor for a successful optogenetic stimulation is delivering an adequate amount of light to the targeted brain objects. The adequate amount of light needed to stimulate each brain object is identified by the tissue optical properties as well as the type of opsin expressed in the tissue, wavelength of the light, and the physical dimensions of the targeted area. Therefore, to implement a precise light delivery system for optogenetics, detailed information about the optical properties of the brain tissue and a mathematical model that incorporates all determining factors is needed to find a good estimation of light distribution in the brain. In general, three measurements are required to obtain the optical properties of any tissue, namely diffuse transmitted light, diffuse reflected light, and transmitted ballistic beam. In this report, these parameters were measured in vitro using intact rat brain slices of 500 mum thickness via a two-integrating spheres optical setup. Then, an inverse adding doubling method was used to extract the optical properties of the tissue from the collected data. These experiments were repeated to cover the whole brain tissue with high spatial resolution for the three different cuts (transverse, sagittal, and coronal) and three different wavelengths (405, 532, and 635 nm) in the visible range of the spectrum. A three-dimensional atlas of the rat brain optical properties was constructed based on the experimental measurements.

1278,"Carcinoma of the skin with perineural invasion Purpose. To evaluate the outcome and patterns of relapse in patients treated for skin carcinoma of the head and neck with either microscopic or clinical perineural invasion. Methods and Materials. Radiotherapy alone or combined with surgery was used to treat 135 patients with microscopic or clinical evidence of perineural invasion of skin carcinoma. All patients had at least 2 years of follow-up. Results. The 5-year local control rates without salvage therapy were 87% with microscopic perineural invasion and 55% with clinical perineural invasion. Overall, 88% of the local failures occurred in patients with positive margins. Almost half of the recurrences in patients with microscopic perineural invasion were limited to the first-echelon regional nodes. However, only 1 of 11 patients with basal cell carcinoma with microscopic perineural invasion had a nodal failure. Ninety percent of recurrences in patients with clinical perineural invasion occurred at the primary site. Cranial nerve deficits rarely improved after successful treatment of the primary disease. Radiographic abnormalities remained stable 30% of the time when patients had clinical evidence of progressive disease. Conclusions. Radiotherapy in patients with skin cancer with clinical perineural invasion should include treatment of the first-echelon regional lymphatics. The risk of regional node involvement is also relatively high for patients with squamous cell carcinoma with microscopic perineural invasion. In patients with clinical perineural invasion, the poor local control rates with conventional radiotherapy suggest a need for dose escalation with or without concomitant chemotherapy.

Influence of decimetric microwave irradiation (460 MHz) on free radical processes in the rat brain tissues--visual cortex and hypothalamus--were investigated. Oxidative effects of both lipid peroxidation and specific activity of glutathione reductase were determined. It is shown that whole body irradiation for up to 4 weeks results in considerable changes of the above indices dependent on the irradiation intensity and age of the animals. Decimetric microwaves have oxidant effects at high intensity irradiation (SAR--15 mW/kg), while these effects are antioxidant at low intensity (SAR--5 mW/kg).

The sole source of retinal dopamine is dopaminergic amacrine cells (DACs). We and others have previously demonstrated that DACs are activated by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) upon illumination. However, it is still not clear how each class of photosensitive cells generates light responses in DACs. We genetically isolated cone function in mice to specifically examine the cone-mediated responses of DACs and their neural pathways. In addition to the reported excitatory input to DACs from light-increment (ON) bipolar cells, we found that cones alternatively signal to DACs via a retrograde signalling pathway from ipRGCs. Cones also produce ON and light-decrement (OFF) inhibitory responses in DACs, which are mediated by other amacrine cells, likely driven by type 1 and type 2/3a OFF bipolar cells, respectively. Dye injections indicated that DACs had similar morphological profiles with or without ON/OFF inhibition. Our data demonstrate that cones utilize specific parallel excitatory and inhibitory circuits to modulate DAC activity and efficiently regulate dopamine release and the light-adaptive state of the retina.",Excluded
501,"Functional imaging of the brain in the evaluation of drug response and its application to the study of aging Functional neuroimaging techniques including single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) can provide insight into the functional connectivity of the human brain in both health and disease, including the effects of aging and drugs on brain function. Neuroimaging measurement techniques can either be direct, using radiospecific ligands, or indirect, using the neurophysiological consequences of pharmacological interventions. Both approaches can be combined with sensorimotor or cognitive activation to examine the interaction between the targeted receptor function and the sensorimotor or cognitive process implicit in the study design. Using radionuclides, PET can provide absolute measurement of cerebral blood flow to regions of interest and can measure changes in cerebral metabolism using labelled fluorodeoxyglucose. PET offered the first opportunity to image brain activation caused by a variety of stimuli and hence to measure the effect of drugs on brain activation. PET also enables the study of drug disposition within the brain. SPECT has been used to study relative changes in cerebral blood flow associated with disease processes and also receptor occupancy. FMRI, by contrast, does not involve ionising radiation and has better spatial and temporal resolution. It is still a relatively new technique and limited by its ability to only measure haemodynamic changes through the blood oxygen lever dependent (BOLD) signal.

1665,"SIRT in primary and metastatic liver tumors Introduction: The liver is one of the most commonly involved organs for metastatic disease. The Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is EU approved since 2002 for treatment of primary or secondary hepatic malignancy. Methods and Results: The procedure exploits a normal physiological process: Healthy liver tissue receives most of its blood supply via the portal vein, while liver tumors receive the majority of their blood supply from the hepatic artery. The microscopic spheres, each approximately 15 to 35mum in diameter, are bonded to yttrium-90 (Y-90), a pure beta emitter with a physical half-life of 64 hours. The microspheres are trapped in the tumor's vascular bed, where they destroy the tumor by reducing its blood supply (embolic effect) and through local radiation damage to the cancer cells' DNA. Inclusion criteria for SIRT are unresectable liver-dominant or liver-only tumors, a life expectancy of more than 12 weeks and an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2. Exclusion criteria are clinical signs of liver failure (ascites, bilirubin >2.0 mg/ dL in absence of a reversible cause, serum albumin < 3.0 g/dL), a pretreatment scan showing >30 Gy exposure to the lungs or non-correctable shunting to the GI tract. Side effects are fatique, fever, nausea, abdominal pain. Potential complications are radiation gastritis, duodenitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis and radiation induced liver disease. SIRT is used in liver-only or liver-dominant disease in combination with systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) at 1<sup>st</sup>-line, 2nd-line or later. As monotherapy for mCRC and other metastatic disease and cholangiocarcinoma SIRT is used as salvage therapy in chemo-refractory patients. In hepatocellular carcinoma SIRT may potentially down-stage to reach respectability. In metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, irrespective of primary site, whether functional or non-functional, SIRT is used as first-or second-line therapy or in treatment-refractory disease. In these patients due to the much longer life expectancy re-treatment and fractionated SIRT appears possible, and may further extend disease control. Studies suggest earlier use may provide greater benefits. Conclusion(s): SIRT is a well tolerated therapy option for patients with malignant liver tumors not suitable for curative local interventions like surgery or ablation.",Excluded

One hundred thirty-four Caucasian men and 105 African-American men were assigned randomly to one of two approaches to delivering the intervention or to the control condition. Men entered the study immediately after surgical treatment or in the first 3 weeks of radiation therapy. Trained nurses delivered the intervention through weekly phone calls for 8 weeks.RESULTS: The authors found that the majority of intervention effects were from baseline to 4 months postbaseline, when treatment side effects are most intense. Both Caucasian men and African-American men who received either one of the two approaches for delivering the intervention improved in the two uncertainty management methods of cognitive reframing and problem solving. Similarly, when the intervention groups were combined, men who received the intervention also improved significantly in control of incontinence by 4 months postbaseline. Decreases in the number of treatment side effects differed by time and treatment/ ethnic group interactions as did satisfaction with sexual functioning.CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first tests of a psychoeducational intervention among men with prostate carcinoma and was the first test that included a sufficient number of African-American men to test by ethnic group.

With long-term space travel, astronauts will be exposed to greater radiation levels. Research shows that an antioxidant-enriched diet may offer some protection against the cellular effects of radiation and may provide significant neuroprotection from the effects of radiation-induced cognitive and behavioral skill deficits. Ninety-six C57BL/6 mice (48 pomegranate fed and 48 control) were irradiated with proton radiation (2 Gy), and two-month postradiation behaviors were assessed using a battery of behavioral tests to measure cognitive and motor functions. Proton irradiation was associated with depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test, but this effect was ameliorated by the pomegranate diet. Males, in general, displayed worse coordination and balance than females on the rotarod task, and the pomegranate diet ameliorated this effect. Overall, it appears that proton irradiation, which may be encountered in space, may induce a different pattern of behavioral deficits in males than females and that a pomegranate diet may confer protection against some of those effects.",Included

Median follow-up time was 3 months. 14 patients were deceased with a median survival of 14.6 months. Leiomyosarcoma was the most common histology among the cohort with 9 patients. Other histologies included- Ewing's (3), osteosarcoma (2), neufibrosarcoma (2), liposarcoma (2), chondrosarcoma (1), hemangiopercytoma (1), rhabdomyoblastic anaplastic (1), spindle cell (1), and unspecified sarcoma(1). The average tumor volume was 53.12 cc (range 2.02-207.25cc). Overall pain response was 75% (25% partial & 50% complete relief). Pain was stable in 25% of the patients, and no pain progression was observed. Total neurological response was 25% (0% complete, 25% partial). 94% of the patients were neurologically stable or improved after treatment. In one patient (6%) a progressed neurological deficit was observed. Total radiographic response was 67% (0% complete, 29% partial, 38% stable). Local tumor progression was observed in 33% of the patients. One patient initially had a partial radiographic response that progressed after 10 months. Another patient was initially stable but experienced radiographic progression after three months. Eight vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) were noted, two of which may be attributed to SRS. No other adverse effects were observed. Conclusion(s): A total of 23 patients and 78 spinal levels were treated with SRS resulting in fairly good response rates for pain relief, neurologic improvement, and radiographic tumor response (75%, 25%, & 67% respectively). Our results indicate that SRS has a role in the treatment of primary and metastatic sarcomas of the spine. Using slightly higher doses may provide improved response rates.",Excluded
918,"Effects of the memory enhancer linopirdine (Dup 996) on cerebral glucose metabolism in naive and hypoxia-exposed rats Linopirdine [DuP 996; 3,3-bis(4-pyrindinylmethyl)-1-phenylindolin-2-one] represents a novel class of compounds which enhance depolarization-activated (but not basal) release of acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin in brain slices and improve learning and memory in rodents. The effects of linopiridine on local cerebral glucose metabolism were studied by the quantitative autoradiographic 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose method. Linopirdine administration in naive rats (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) did not significantly alter cerebral glucose metabolism in any of the regions analyzed. Since linopirdine protects against hypoxia-induced passive avoidance deficits in rats, we also examined the effects of linopirdine on cerebral metabolism after the rats were exposed to 30 min of hypoxia. Glucose metabolism was not significantly altered after hypoxic exposure, except for a small increase in some brain regions. Linopirdine administered after hypoxia decreased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus, limbic cortex, ventral hippocampal commissure, medial septum, striatum, subthalamic nucleus, zona incerta, lateral habenula, cerebral cortex, cerebellar vermis and a few thalamic nuclei. Statistically significant effects of linopirdine on glucose metabolism were observed in 22 of 56 brain regions sampled. In hypoxia-exposed rats, linopirdine altered glucose metabolism in brain regions that are implicated in learning and memory and are affected in Alzheimer's disease. Several of the affected regions are associated with the cholinergic system and may play a role in the cognitive enhancing properties of linopirdine.",Excluded
484,"Spatial Memory Performance of Socially Mature Wistar Rats is Impaired after Exposure to Low (5 cGy) Doses of 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti Particles Prolonged deep space missions to planets and asteroids will expose astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), a mixture of low-LET ionizing radiations, high-energy protons and high-Z and energy (HZE) particles. Ground-based experiments are used to determine whether this radiation environment will have an effect on the long-term health of astronauts and their ability to complete various tasks during their mission. Emerging data suggest that mission-relevant HZE doses impair several hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive processes in rodents, but that there is substantial interindividual variation in the severity of neurocognitive impairment, ranging from no observable effects to severe impairment. While the majority of studies have established the effect that the most abundant HZE species (<sup>56</sup>Fe) has on neurocognition, some studies suggest that the lighter <sup>48</sup>Ti HZE particles may be equally, if not more, potent at impairing neurocognition. In this study, we assessed the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti had on the spatial memory performance of socially mature male Wistar rats. Acute exposures to mission-relevant doses (<=5 cGy) of 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the mean spatial memory performance of the rats at three months after exposure, and significantly (P < 0.015) increased the percentage of rats that have severe (Z score >= 2) impairment, i.e., poor performers. Collectively, these data further support the notion that the LET dependency of neurocognitive impairment may differ from that of cell killing.",Included
3351,"Recurrent breast cancer involving the brachial plexus identified by FDG PET/CT Purpose: Identifying malignant involvement of the brachial plexus in breast cancer patients is challenging from both a clinical and an imaging perspective. We evaluated the ability of PET/CT to detect malignant involvement of the brachial plexus in patients with a prior history of breast cancer. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients presenting with neuropathy and a prior history who underwent a FDG PET/CT scan from 9/01/05 to 9/01/09 was undertaken. Patients were included if the neurologic examination documented a regional pain syndrome, motor abnormalities or sensory deficits and PET/CT was ordered within 1 month of presentation. Brachial plexus involvement was confirmed by biopsy and/or resolved with cancer treatment. The location of brachial plexus involvement and other sites of disease identified on PET/CT were correlated to the pathologic results and clinical outcome. Result(s): Arm pain or peripheral neuropathy led to PT/CT evaluation in 81 patients (mean age 67.3+/-9.6) who had subsequently biopsy or clinical follow-up. FDG uptake indicative of recurrent malignancy was identified in the brachial plexus on PET/CT scans in 66 patients (81.5%). Forty-three patients had biopsy confirmation and the rest demonstrated resolution on PET/CT following treatment. The linear FDG uptake within the thicken plexus ranged from mild to intense (SUVmax= 2.1-12.3; mean 5.6). In 3 patients discontinuous plexus involvement was seen and confirmed by biopsy as skip lesions. In all but 5 patients, the brachial plexus was the only site of breast cancer recurrence identified on PET/CT. In the 15 PET/CT negative patients, 12 had positive MR. Biopsy or clinical follow-up determined that these 12 patients did not have brachial plexus disease but MR signal abnormalities were due to from post-treatment radiation or surgical changes. Conclusion(s): PET/CT readily detects breast cancer involvement in the brachial plexus in presenting with upper extremity symptoms. FDG PET/CT was able to differentiate an active tumor from post-treatment changes.",Excluded

2562,"Role of 11C-Methionine PET/CT for radiotherapy Planning of patients affected by Primary Brain Tumour Purpose: 11C-MET is a radiolabelled aminoacid successfully utilized in PET imaging of primary and metastatic brain tumours. So far, very limited evidence concerns its utilization for radiotherapy planning. Thus the aim of our study is that to investigate its role in patients affected by rimary brain tumours in this clinical setting. Method(s): we enrolled 21 patients (M:F=14:8; mean age 53.2yrs) affected by a histologically proven primary/relapsed gliomas, who were addressed to our Institution for radiotherapy. Almost half of them (10/21) had already been treated and presented during relapse. In all cases dedicated MR, CT and MET-PET were scheduled before treatment and performed according to standard procedures. GTV was outlined on CT images fused to MR (GTV-MRI/CT), on MET-PET positive regions only (GTV-PET), and final volumes were calculated by using PET/CT/MRI coregistered images. Optimal radiation dose required was 60Gy. In 7 patients a contemporary Chemo/radiotherapy regimen was administered. The mean observational period was 6months, up to 22months. In 13 patients a postradiotherapy evaluation was performed and of these we calculated PFS and OS. In 3 patients progression/relapse was defined within 7 months, whereas other 3 patients deceased within 2 months. Statistical analysis was performed on clinical and instrumental data in order to define correlation and prognostic value of different parameters. Result(s): in19 out of 21 patients a GTV-PET could be defined (mean 18,3cc), which in 14 cases (73,7%) determined a modification of the GTVMRI/ CT (mean 58.79cc). Malignant lesions presented a SUV<inf>max</inf>=3.37 (range1.60- 5.17) and a SUVratio(SUV<inf>max</inf>/SUVnormal)=2.43 (range1.53-3.26). There was a significant correlation between tumour grade and SUV<inf>max</inf> (p<0,0001). In 10/21 cases the tumour was multifocal, of which 3/10 bilateral. The overall volume change, according MET-PET, was 139,58cc (mean 6,65cc), corresponding to 11,2% of total GTV. The ROC-analysis defined an optimal SUV<inf>max</inf> cut-off point<=2,7 (Sens.100%; Spec.90%), whereas for SUVratio<=1,73 (Sens.100%; Spec.81,3%). Univariate analysis on PFS documented a significant correlation for SUV<inf>max</inf> cut-off (p=0,0077) and SUVratio cut-off (p=0,0301), but not for tumour grade (p=0,7961), previous relapses (p=0,1573), tumour multifocality (p=0,5271) and concomitant chemo/radiotherapy (p=0,5749).

1863,"Increased hippocampal TrkA expression ameliorates cranial radiation-induced neurogenesis impairment and cognitive deficit via PI3K/AKT signaling Cognitive deficit is one of the most serious complications of cranial radiotherapy of head and neck cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of this cognitive impairment remains unclear. In the present study, the role of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and its ligand neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) were investigated following whole-brain irradiation (WBI). Young male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent WBI at a single dose of 10 Gy. WBI was determined to result in notable memory decline and substantial neurogenesis impairment in the hippocampus 3 months post-irradiation. Compared with the control group, TrkA protein expression was greater in irradiated rats 1 week after WBI, which then decreased significantly by the 3-month time-point. However, no difference in NGF expression was observed from 1 day to 3 months post-WBI. Overexpression of hippocampal TrkA in rats using adeno-associated virus ameliorated memory decline induced by irradiation. Additionally, upregulating TrkA expression rescued irradiation-induced hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and promoted neurogenesis. PI3K, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were also revealed to be significantly inhibited by WBI, which was ameliorated by TrkA overexpression. Findings of the present study indicated that the TrkA-dependent signaling pathway may serve a critical role in radiotherapy-induced cognitive deficit and impairments in neurogenesis.",Included

According to the treatment modality, patients were allocated to PCI group and non-PCI group. Univariate survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate survival analysis was performed by a Cox proportional hazards model.A total of 52 patients were included for analysis, among which, 19 patients were in PCI group and 33 were in non-PCI group. Multivariate analysis revealed that PCI (HR = .330; P = .041) was an independently favorable prognostic factor for the overall survival. The median overall survival (OS) time was 32.9 months in PCI group, and 20.4 months in non-PCI group. The 2-year OS rates were 78.0% and 38.0% in PCI and non-PCI group respectively (P = .023). The brain metastasis-free survival (BMFS) rate at 2-year in PCI group was significantly higher than those of non-PCI group (89.0% vs 53.0%, respectively, P = .026).

3393,"Treatment of near-skull brain tissue with a focused device using shear-mode conversion: a numerical study Shear mode transmission through the skull has been previously proposed as a new trans-skull propagation technique for noninvasive therapeutic ultrasound (Clement 2004 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115 1356-64). The main advantage of choosing shear over longitudinal mode resides on the fact that there is less wavefront distortion with the former. In the present study, the regions of the brain suitable for shear-mode transmission were established for a simple focused ultrasound device. The device consists of a spherically curved transducer that has a focal length of 10 cm, an aperture between 30 degrees and 60 degrees and operates at 0.74 MHz. The regions suitable for shear-mode transmission were determined by the shear wave acoustic windows that matched the shape of the device acoustic field. The acoustic windows were calculated using segmentation and triangulation of outer and inner faces of skull from 3D-MRI head datasets. Nine heads of healthy adults were analyzed. The surface considered for the calculations was the head region found above the supra-orbital margin. For every inspected point in the brain volume, the axis of the device was determined by the vector between this inspection point and a point located in the center of the brain. Numerical predictions of the acoustic field, where shear-mode conversion through the skull was considered, were obtained and compared to the case of water-only conditions. The brain tissue that is close to the skull showed suitable acoustic windows for shear waves. The central region of the brain seems to be unreachable using shear-mode. Analysis of the acoustic fields showed a proportional relation between the acoustic window for shear mode and the effective degree of focusing. However, this relation showed significant differences among specimens. In general, highly focused fields were obtained when the acoustic window for shear waves (A(SW)) intersected more than 67% of the entering acoustic window (A(TX)) of the device. The average depth from the inner surface of the skull showing this intersection value was 13 +/- 10 mm (mean +/- SD). The differences of the degree of focusing observed among patients suggest that the intersection A(SW) intersection A(TX) can be used as a preliminary criterion for screening and calculation of the acoustic fields should confirm the degree of focusing patient by patient. In conclusion, shear waves provide a useful method for trans-cranial focusing in regions close to the skull surface.",Excluded
1374,"Evaluation of intracellular and extracellular domoic acid content in Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cell cultures under different light regimes Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries is a diatom species associated with the production of domoic acid (DA), a water soluble neurotoxin that is easily transferred up in the food web, causing devastating effects on top marine organisms and humans. Despite studies on Pseudo-nitzschia are relevant to human health safety, partitioning of marine toxins between intracellular and extracellular fractions are poorly documented. This study aimed to determine the growth rates and DA content, both intracellular and extracellular, of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cultures at three different light settings (15, 120 and 560mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The optimal conditions for cell growth were observed at 120 and 560mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, whereas DA production was observed in P. multiseries at 15 and 120mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, ranging between 0.18-2.56 and 0.16-3.5pg DA cell<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Higher intracellular DA concentrations were found during the senescence phase at low light intensity and during the exponential phase at medium light intensity, while higher concentrations of dissolved DA were found at low and medium light intensities in the senescence phase reaching 3 and 10ng DA mL<sup>-1</sup> respectively. The amount of toxin released into the culture medium represents the most important fraction ranging between 63 and 98% during the exponential phase and nearly 99% during the senescence phase. In contrast, under low light intensity, dissolved DA was detected in the culture medium only during the senescence phase. This study confirms the importance of light intensity on DA production and clearly shows that dissolved domoic acid is an important fraction in Pseudo-nitzschia cultures, suggesting with the careful assumptions of results from static cultures extrapolated to bloom situations that waterborne exposure of marine organism should be considered during blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries.",Excluded
2451,"Rapamycin attenuates visible light-induced injury in retinal photoreceptor cells via inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress An extended exposure of the retina to visible light may lead to photochemical damage in retinal photoreceptor cells. The exact mechanism of retinal light damage remains unknown, and an effective therapy is still unavailable. Here, we demonstrated that rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), markedly protected 661W photoreceptor cells from visible light exposure-induced damage at the nanomolar level. We also observed by transmission electron microscopy that light exposure led to severe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in 661W cells as well as abnormal endomembranes and ER membranes. In addition, obvious upregulated ER stress markers were monitored by western blot at the protein level and by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the mRNA level. Interestingly, rapamycin pretreatment significantly suppressed light-induced ER stress and all three major branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR), including the RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathways both at the protein and mRNA levels. Additionally, the inhibition of ER stress by rapamycin was further confirmed with a dithiothreitol (DTT; a classical ER stress inducer)-damaged 661W cell model. Meanwhile, our results also revealed that rapamycin was able to remarkably inhibit the activation of mTOR and its downstream factors eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), p-4EBP1, p70, p-p70, and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p-S6K) in the light-injured 661W cells. Thus, these data indicate that visible light induces ER stress in 661W cells; whereas the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, effectively protects 661W cells from light injury through suppressing the ER stress pathway.",Excluded

Method(s): Fifty-five RE patients and 54 healthy age-matched subjects were enrolled in this retrospective cross-sectional case-control study. The best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) of the included eye should not be more than 0. The vessel density and thickness of different locations in the retina were acquired automatically using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The data were then compared between the RE patients and the controls. The location included the whole retina, the superficial vascular plexus (SVP)/the ganglion cell complex (GCC), the deep vascular plexus (DVP), and the choroid in the macular area, as well as the inside disc and peripapillary area in the optic nerve head (ONH). The risk factors in OCTA retinal impairments were analyzed using a backward multiple linear regression. The relationships between mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) in the visual field (VF) and the OCTA parameters were also analyzed in RE patients. Result(s): The vessel density of the GCC was significantly reduced in RE patients compared with controls (p = 0.018), and the reductions were mainly shown in the parafoveal (p = 0.049) and perifoveal fields (p = 0.006). The thickness of the GCC was correspondingly reduced (whole image GCC mean thickness: p = 0.044; parafoveal thickness: p = 0.038; perifoveal thickness: p = 0.038). In addition, the sub-foveal choroidal thickness (p = 0.039) was also reduced in RE patients. The vessel density of the GCC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.643) and DVP (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.777) had a significant positive correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and had a significant negative correlation with age (GCC: HDL-C, beta = 29.89, p = 0.005; ApoA1, beta = 78.92, p = 0.002; age, beta = -0.886, p = 0.001; DVP: HDL-C, beta = 40.09, p = 0.003; ApoA1, beta = 62.65, p = 0.013; age, beta = -1.31, p = 0.001). The vessel density of the GCC also had a significant negative correlation with apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (beta = -32.18, p = 0.006). In the VF, MD had a significant positive correlation with the vessel density inside disc (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.241, beta = 0.304, p = 0.045), whereas PSD showed a significant negative correlation with the vessel density inside disc and the average GCC thickness, respectively (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.437; vessel density inside disc, beta = -0.358, p = 0.004; average GCC thickness, beta = -0.510, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): With the aid of OCTA, we found that neurovascular alterations of the retina may exist in RE patients with normal-ranged visual acuity. Herein, we suggest the implementation of OCTA to assist ophthalmologists in the early detection and consistent monitoring of radiation-related eye diseases to avoid delayed diagnosis.

The seventh cervical vertebra contains relatively large pedicles and has a low incidence of vertebral artery localization within the transverse foramina. The freehand technique of pedicle screw insertion is advantageous in decreasing intraoperative radiation exposure both to the patient and surgeon. In this study, we investigated the safety and accuracy of C7 pedicle screw placement at our institution utilizing an anatomic freehand technique.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was performed, and 20 patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria over a five-year period (2013-2018). The C7 pedicle screw placement capability and accuracy were recorded. Accuracy was graded based upon postoperative imaging on a Grade 0-3 scale for breach assessment. Any neurologic complications related to screw placement were also recorded.RESULTS: Successful pedicle screw placement occurred in 90% of attempts (36/40). The overall screw accuracy rate was 89% (32/36). There were four minor breaches (Grade 1) identified on CT, without neurologic complications. The fusion rate in our cohort for patients with follow up greater than eight months was 100%.CONCLUSIONS: In our patient series, the freehand technique of C7 pedicle screw placement utilizing a small laminotomy with direct pedicle palpation appears to be a safe and accurate method for screw placement, and provides adequate biomechanical stability for cervical and cervicothoracic construct fusion.",Excluded

Aim 1 - To provide 3 year results for the longitudinal study. Aim 2 - To improve the questionnaire used to collect data by identifying redundant items and modifying for use to collect Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) data.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Aim 1 - Patient reported outcome data were collected prospectively by 226 patients before and up to 3 years following radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer using a questionnaire developed to collect LENT subjective data. Aim 2 - A factor analysis was performed to identify which questions gave the most and least information.RESULTS: Aim 1 - Faecal urgency and incontinence (all grades) peaked at 79% and 24%, respectively at 1 year then settled to 69% and 18% at 3 years, respectively. Urinary urgency (all grades) increased with time and was described in 75% at 3 years. Other symptoms reported at 3 years include diarrhoea in 12%, urinary incontinence in 27% and vaginal dryness in 29%. A third of patients did not feel their sex life had changed following treatment, while a quarter felt that it had. Aim 2 - some questions overlapped and others were non-specific. The questionnaire has subsequently been altered.CONCLUSIONS: The extent of late toxicity is substantial. This detailed information is important for both patients and clinicians in terms of treatment decisions and follow-up care. The LENT questionnaire provides a feasible tool for capture of this information in the clinic.",Excluded

Pain originating from skeletal metastases is the most common form of cancer-related pain. Bone pain, often exacerbated by pressure or movement, limits the patient's autonomy and social life. Pain palliation with bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals has proven to be an effective treatment modality in patients with metastatic bone pain. These bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals are extremely powerful in treating scattered painful bone metastases, for which external beam radiotherapy is impossible because of the large field of irradiation. (186)Re-hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (HEDP) is a potentially useful radiopharmaceutical for this purpose, having numerous advantageous characteristics. Bone marrow toxicity is limited and reversible, which makes repetitive treatment safe. Studies have shown encouraging clinical results of palliative therapy using (186)Re-HEDP, with an overall response rate of ca. 70% in painful bone metastases. It is effective for fast palliation of painful bone metastases from various tumours and the effect tends to last longer if patients are treated early in the course of their disease. (186)Re-HEDP is at least as effective in breast cancer patients with painful bone metastases as in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. It is to be preferred to radiopharmaceuticals with a long physical half-life in this group of patients, who tend to have more extensive haematological toxicity since they have frequently been pretreated with bone marrow suppressive chemotherapy. This systemic form of radionuclide therapy is simple to administer and complements other treatment options. It has been associated with marked pain reduction, improved mobility in many patients, reduced dependence on analgesics, and improved performance status and quality of life.

2697,"Brain enzyme histochemistry following stabilization by microwave irradiation The activities of various enzymes present in brain homogenates were assayed biochemically (a) with no pretreatment, (b) following a standard microwave treatment in saline and (c) after a standard microwave treatment in formalin. All enzyme activity was lost after the microwave - formalin in treatment. Following microwave - saline treatment, the activities of alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, isocitrate and succinate dehydrogenases were reduced. In contrast, the activities of lactate and malate dehydrogenases were unchanged, and that of acetylcholinesterase apparently increased. Analogous outcomes were seen following attempted histochemical demonstrations of these enzymes. Thus satisfactory histochemical demonstration of all enzymes was achieved (except with alkaline phosphatase, lactate and malate dehydrogenases) following the microwave-saline pretreatment. Since acid phosphatase, catalase and peroxidase were also successfully demonstrated, it seems that microwave-saline pretreatments permit both retention of sufficient enzyme activity for histochemical demonstration to occur and retention of sufficient structural integrity for critical morphological investigations. Since the failure to stain the sites of lactate and malate dehydrogenases is not due to microwave inactivation of these enzymes, their demonstration may be possible by varying the staining procedures.",Excluded

The control group included 150 healthy people. Recording and mapping of coherence (COH) of the brain electrical activity was conducted using the apparatus-software complex for topographic mapping of brain electrical activity NEURO-CM (Russia) with the bandwidth from 0 to 40 Hz and the time constant of 0.3 sec. The EEG record was carried out monopolar from symmetrical cortical zones (10-20% scheme). Changes of COH were characterized by staging in patients compared to the controls. In the initial stage of disease, the integrative links were decreased in the temporal cortical zones of the left hemisphere. The reduction of functional activity in temporal-central cortical zones was found that might be the consequence of mesodiencephalic dysfunction. In the later stages, temporal zones of the right hemisphere were mostly affected. The parallel reinforcement of functional activity of occipital zones, in particular, the increase of 'long links' with frontal areas, was noted in the overall formation of the psychoorganic syndrome. This phenomenon may be considered as a compensatory mechanism when the phylogenetically older cortical zones, which are more resistant to pathological changes, become leaders in the realization of integrative brain activity during the development of a pathological state.",Included

This paper reports attempts to construct 3 double-mutant strains containing the following pair-wise combinations of repair-deficient mutants: upr-1,uvs-2; uvs-2,uvs-6; and uvs-3,uvs-6. The double-mutant strain with the 2 excision-repair-deficient mutants upr-1 and uvs-2 shows increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced mutagenesis and inactivation, relative to that shown by either of the parental single-mutant strains. This double mutant is no more sensitive than the parental single-mutant strains to either UV mutagenesis or inactivation. The combination of the uvs-2 and uvs-6 double-mutant strain is considerably more sensitive to both UV and X-ray inactivation than either the uvs-2 or uvs-6 strain, but it shows no greater sensitivity than the parental strains to ad-3 mutation induction by either agent. The combination of the uvs-3 and uvs-6 alleles is inviable. Tetrad analysis and microscopical examination of ascospores shows that ascospores of presumptive genotype uvs-3, uvs-6 do not grow beyond the formation of a few hyphal threads. The lethal and mutagenic effects of UV and X-irradiation in these double-mutant strains are interpreted in terms of the repair systems in Neurospora and other microorganisms.",Excluded

Dose to the surrounding normal brain from an <sup>125</sup>I implant has been compared with the dose from an external irradiation technique. Results show that an implant offers a higher dose gradient around the tumor and hence a lower dose to the normal brain. Moreover, some irregular-shaped tumors, while ideal for a stereotactic implant, may be very difficult to treat with external beams without delivering a significant radiation dose to the normal brain. An implant seems to be dosimetrically superior to external irradiation for delivering large tumor doses.",Excluded
1104,"Patterns of care for patients with small cell lung cancer: A survey of German radiation oncology institutions on recommendations for prophylactic cranial irradiation Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC was first proposed in 1973 and is recommended for patients demonstrating good response to initial therapy. The general pattern of care amongst radiation oncologists in Germany has not been previously evaluated.We conceptualized and conducted this survey to assess patterns of care. Method(s): We surveyed radiation oncology institutions in Germany via an online questionnaire sent by e-mail to member institutions of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO e.V.). The questions were based on respondent and treatment characteristics with emphasis on prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited- and extensive-stage SCLC. Result(s):We receivedatotal of95responses (29%response rate). Of which 64were completed and returned and hence eligible for evaluation. Sixty-one percent of respondents were between the ages of 50-59, 88%with over 15 years of experience in the management of lungmalignancies. Sixtysevenpercent of the institutions stage theirpatients initially with 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Of the 64 responses, 97% recommended deliveryofPCI in therapy responders with LS-SCLC compared to 67% with ES-SCLC. Interestingly, a quarter of respondents offered hippocampal-avoidance PCI with only 38% following their patients with serial brain imaging followingPCI.Neuropsychological testingwas generally not routinely performed. Conclusion(s): German radiation oncology institutions showed interesting variations in certain aspects yet in general congruence in SCLC management and PCI delivery in accordance with the updated national and international guidelines. Future randomized clinical trials will further reduce discrepancies regarding delivery of PCI especially in ES-SCLC.",Excluded
3045,"Comparison of the efficacy and safety of tropisetron, metoclopramide, and chlorpromazine in the treatment of emesis associated with far advanced cancer BACKGROUND. A single institution, prospective, randomized trial was performed in terminal cancer patients to compare tropisetron (TRO), metoclopramide (MET), and chlorpromazine (CHL) in the management of nausea and emesis. Patients had far advanced cancer, were far removed from chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and their nausea and emesis was not due to bowel obstruction, drug intake, or cranial, electrolytic, or metabolic causes. The effects of antiemetic treatments were evaluated from Days 1-15. METHODS. Two hundred and eighty patients were randomized to receive 1) MET+ dexamethasone (DEX) (10 mg*4 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 2) TRO (5 mg*l, orally), 3) TRO + MET (5 mg*l and 10 mg*2, respectively, orally), 4) TRO + MET + DEX (5 mg*l, 10 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 5) CHL + DEX (25 mg*2 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 6) TRO + CHL (5 mg*l and 12.5 mg*2, respectively, orally), or 7) TRO + CHL + DEX (5 mg*l, 12.5 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally). Total control was defined as no nausea or emesis. RESULTS. By the end of the 15th day, total control of emesis was obtained in 23.6% (9 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 78.9% (30 of 38) of TRO patients, 84.2% (32 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 92.3% (36 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 33.3 (13 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 84.6% (33 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 92.5% (37 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. Total control of nausea was achieved in 18.4% (7 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 65.7% (25 of 38) of TRO patients, 73.6% (28 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 87.1% (34 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 17.9% (7 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 74.3% (29 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 85% (34 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. When comparing MET + DEX versus TRO; MET + DEX versus TRO + MET; MET + DEX versus TRO + MET + DEX; MET + DEX versus TRO + CHL; MET + DEX versus TRO + CHL + DEX; CHL + DEX versus TRO; CHL + DEX versus TRO + MET; CHL + DEX versus TRO + MET + DEX; CHL + DEX versus TRO + CHL; and CHL + DEX versus TRO + CHL + DEX, significant differences were noted. All antiemetic drugs were well tolerated with no severe side effects observed in any treatment arm. C0NCLUSIONS. These data suggest that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as tropisetron clinically are more effective in the control of emesis of patients with far advanced cancer than previously used agents.

3118,"S-Nitrosylation in Organs of Mice Exposed to Low or High Doses of gamma-Rays: The Modulating Effect of Iodine Contrast Agent at a Low Radiation Dose The covalent addition of nitric oxide (NO<sup>*</sup>) onto cysteine thiols, or S-nitrosylation, modulates the activity of key signaling proteins. The dysregulation of normal S-nitrosylation contributes to degenerative conditions and to cancer. To gain insight into the biochemical changes induced by low-dose ionizing radiation, we determined global S-nitrosylation by the ""biotin switch"" assay coupled with mass spectrometry analyses in organs of C57BL/6J mice exposed to acute 0.1 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma-rays. The dose of radiation was delivered to the whole body in the presence or absence of iopamidol, an iodinated contrast agent used during radiological examinations. To investigate whether similar or distinct nitrosylation patterns are induced following high-dose irradiation, mice were exposed in parallel to acute 4 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma rays. Analysis of modulated S-nitrosothiols (SNO-proteins) in freshly-harvested organs of animals sacrificed 13 days after irradiation revealed radiation dose- and contrast agent-dependent changes. The major results were as follows: (i) iopamidol alone had significant effects on S-nitrosylation in brain, lung and liver; (ii) relative to the control, exposure to 0.1 Gy without iopamidol resulted in statistically-significant SNO changes in proteins that differ in molecular weight in liver, lung, brain and blood plasma; (iii) iopamidol enhanced the decrease in S-nitrosylation induced by 0.1 Gy in brain; (iv) whereas a decrease in S-nitrosylation occurred at 0.1 Gy for proteins of ~50 kDa in brain and for proteins of ~37 kDa in liver, an increase was detected at 4 Gy in both organs; (v) mass spectrometry analyses of nitrosylated proteins in brain revealed differential modulation of SNO proteins (e.g., sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1; beta tubulins; ADP-ribosylation factor 5) by low- and high-dose irradiation; and (vi) ingenuity pathway analysis identified major signaling networks to be modulated, in particular the neuronal nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway was differentially modulated by low- and high-dose gamma-irradiation.",Included
840,Accurate localization of optic radiation during neurosurgery in an interventional MRI suite Accurate localization of the optic radiation is key to improving the surgical outcome for patients undergoing anterior temporal lobe resection for the treatment of refractory focal epilepsy. Current commercial interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners are capable of performing anatomical and diffusion weighted imaging and are used for guidance during various neurosurgical procedures. We present an interventional imaging workflow that can accurately localize the optic radiation during surgery. The workflow is driven by a near real-time multichannel nonrigid image registration algorithm that uses both anatomical and fractional anisotropy pre- and intra-operative images. The proposed workflow is implemented on graphical processing units and we perform a warping of the pre-operatively parcellated optic radiation to the intra-operative space in under 3 min making the proposed algorithm suitable for use under the stringent time constraints of neurosurgical procedures. The method was validated using both a numerical phantom and clinical data using pre- and post-operative images from patients who had undergone surgery for treatment of refractory focal epilepsy and shows strong correlation between the observed post-operative visual field deficit and the predicted damage to the optic radiation. We also validate the algorithm using interventional MRI datasets from a small cohort of patients. This work could be of significant utility in image guided interventions and facilitate effective surgical treatments.,Excluded

Rod outer segments were on average 66.4 +/- 11.2 microm (mean +/- S.D., n = 104) in length and 6.6 +/- 0.9 microm (mean +/- S.D.) in diameter: 40 +/- 22 photoisomerizations (mean +/- S.D., range 10-99, n = 16) were required for eliciting a half-saturating photocurrent response. The time-to-peak was 911 +/- 217 ms (mean +/- S.D., n = 14, 20 degrees C) in the linear range of the response and the integration time of the current response was 1744 +/- 451 ms (mean +/- S.D., n = 14). The time-to-peak appears to be slower and the integration time shorter in Caudiverbera than in Ambystoma tigrinum, Rana pipiens or Xenopus laevis rods under similar experimental conditions. The a-band of rod spectral sensitivity has a lambda(max) at 520 +/- 2.1 nm (mean +/- S.D., range 516-525 nm, n = 24) and the bandwidth fits a porphyropsin visual pigment.

Also, lipid peroxidation as malondialdehyde (MDA) and metallothionein (MT) levels were measured in liver, kidney and testis. Rats were exposed to total dose of 0.03Gy gamma-rays along 12h at a low dose rate (2.5mGy/h). The results obtained manifested elevation in all essential metals studied in liver. All organs showed elevated Ca levels except that of brain with non-significant change in intestine. Decrease in Fe levels were observed in kidney, testis, intestine, heart and brain tissues with insignificant change in spleen tissue. Elevation in MDA in liver and kidney tissues was recorded and an inhibition in MT in liver, kidney and testis tissues was demonstrated.

The spontaneous SCE levels did not differ between patients and controls, but the cells from each of the patients showed a significantly enhanced response to the induction of SCE by both mutagens - the patients' cells being up to 50% more sensitive than controls. Cultures from five FrA patients and five controls were analysed to determine the spontaneous incidence of chromosomal aberrations and exposed to a graded series of X-ray doses to measure their response to radiation-induced chromosome damage. The spontaneous aberration incidence in controls did not differ from that found in other control series, but the background incidence of aberrations in cells from the FrA patients was significantly above control levels and appeared to reflect an enhanced response to diagnostic exposure to radionuclides. The FrA cells showed a significantly enhanced in vitro response to chromosome aberration induction by X-rays, the net aberration yields being some 60% greater than those in irradiated controls at doses up to 200 rads. It is concluded that FrA is yet another syndrome which shows hypersensitivity to the induction of chromosome damage by mutagens. Possible factors responsible for this hypersensitivity are discussed and comparisons drawn with ataxia telangiectasia, another autosomal recessive disease characterized by enhanced X-ray sensitivity.",Excluded
3066,"Morphological and functional identifications of catfish retinal neurons. I. Classical morphology The morphology of the catfish horizontal cells is comparable to that in other fish retinas. The external horizontal cells contact cone receptors and are stellate in shape; the intermediate horizontal cells are even more so and contact rod receptors. The internal horizontal cells constitute the most proximal layer of the inner nuclear layer and may possibly be, in reality, extended processes from the other two horizontal cell types. Bipolar cells resemble those in other teleost retinas: the size and shape of their dendritic tree encompass a continuous spectrum ranging from what is known as the small to the large bipolar cells. The accepted definition of amacrine cells is sufficiently vague to justify our originating a more descriptive and less inferential name for the (axonless) neurons in the inner nuclear layer which radiate processes throughout the inner synaptic layer. These starbust and spaghetti cells vary considerably in the character and extent of their dendritic spread, but correlates exist in other vertebrate retinas. Ganglion cells are found not only in the classical ganglion layer but displaced into the inner nuclear layer as well. Several types can be distinguished on the basis of cell geometry and by the properties of their dendritic tree. Not all of the categorization corresponds with previous descriptions; our findings suggest that some reorganization may be necessary in the accepted classification of cells in the proximal areas of the vertebrate retina. A subtle yet remarkable pattern underlies the entire structure of the catfish retina; there exists a definite gradient of size within a particular class of cells, and of configuration among the subclasses of a specific cell type. It remains to be seen if these morphological spectra bear any functional consequences. The fact that the structure of the catfish retina most closely resembles those of other phylogenetically ancient animals, such as the skate and the dogfish shark, testifies to its primitive organization; morphological and functional mechanisms discernible in this simple system may, therefore, be applicable to the retinas of higher ordered vertebrates.",Excluded

Optimal management of recurrent CNSL is poorly defined. Objective We aim to determine the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of recurrent CNSL. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of patients having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for recurrent intracranial CNSL between 1999 and 2011. Results Fourteen patients (20 tumors) underwent SRS. The median patient age was 71 years (range, 18-82 years). Seven patients (50%) had primary CNSL. All had received prior chemotherapy, and nine patients (64%) had undergone prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with a median dose of 40 Gy in 25 fractions. The median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Score was 80. The median tumor volume was 6.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 0.5-37.7); the median margin dose was 15.5 Gy (range, 10-18). Eleven patients (79%) had tumor regression (n = 11) shown on MRI after SRS. The median overall survival after SRS was 9.5 months. No patient had a major radiation-related complication. Conclusion Stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with recurrent CNSL is well tolerated and has a high rate of radiographic response. A marginal dose of 15.5 Gy or greater, a Karnofsky score of 80 or greater, and the absence of pre-SRS WBRT were associated with significantly longer overall survival. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be beneficial as an initial salvage therapy in the treatment of recurrent CNSL for properly selected patients. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

The electric field spatial distributions of three conventional ECT electrode placements (bilateral, bifrontal, and right unilateral) and an experimental electrode configuration, focal electrically administered seizure therapy (FEAST), were computed. A quantitative comparison of the electric field strength was subsequently performed in specific brain regions of interest thought to be associated with side effects of ECT (e.g., hippocampus and in-sula). The results show that neglecting white matter conductivity anisotropy yields a difference up to 19%, 25% and 34% in electric field strength in the whole brain, hippocampus, and insula, respectively.

Electrical stimulation was delivered as single pulses (n=55), paired-pulses (n=15) and tetanic trains (n=11). NTS cells with GP-evoked responses were also tested for responsivity to taste stimuli (0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 M sucrose, 0.01 M HCl and 0.01 M quinine HCl). Fifty-five neurons were studied: 49 cells showed GP-evoked (mean latency+/-SEM=18.0+/-1.32 ms); seven of these were taste-responsive. Spontaneous rate of these cells was low (mean+/-SEM=1.4+/-0.3 spikes per second; median=0.21 spikes per second) and many cells showed no spontaneous activity. Paired-pulse stimulation of the GP nerve in 13 rats produced both paired-pulse suppression (n=11) and paired-pulse enhancement (n=4); tetanic stimulation (25 Hz, 1.0 s) produced sustained (>20 s) increases or decreases in firing rate in 7 of 11 cells tested. Histological data suggested that GP-evoked responses recorded in the most rostral NTS were likely the result of polysynaptic connections. Cells with GP-evoked responses formed a heterogeneous group in terms of their response properties and differed from cells with evoked responses to chorda tympani (CT; which innervates taste buds on the rostral 1/3 of the tongue) nerve stimulation.

However, the evidence for cell toxicity induced by static magnetic field (SMF) is still uncertain. We investigated the effects produced by the exposure of human SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells to a uniform magnetic field at intensities of 2.2 mT, which is less than the recommended public exposure limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). A decrease of membrane mitochondrial potential up to 30% was measured after 24 h of exposure to SMF in SH-SY5Y cells, and this effect was associated with reactive oxygen species production increase. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that exposure to a static magnetic intensity around 2.2 mT changed the secondary structure of cellular proteins and lipid components. The vibration bands relative to the methylene group increased significantly after 4 h of exposure, whereas further exposure up to 24 h produced evident shifts of amide I and II modes and a relative increase in beta-sheet contents with respect to alpha-helix components. Our study demonstrated that a moderate SMF causes alteration in cell homeostasis, as indicated by FTIR spectroscopy observations of changes in protein structures that are part of cell response to magnetic field exposure.",Excluded
1539,"IBS19.02 Novel Radiotherapy Approaches in Small Cell Lung Carcinoma - Has SABR and Radionuclide Therapy Got a Role to Play? Thoracic radiotherapy has been shown in to increase overall survival when added to systemic therapy in patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and M0 stage. The dose, fractionation, treatment time and timing issues have not been fully resolved. A recent study did not show the superiority of 66Gy in 33 daily fractions over 6.5 weeks over twice-daily radiotherapy to a dose of 45 Gy in 30 fractions over 3 weeks twice daily [1]. For stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has been clearly shown to be superior to conventional fractionation [2]. Given the clear benefit seen in early stage NSCLC, it is postulated that SABR may have a role to play in early stage SCLC. A recent multi-institutional cohort study has reported favourable outcomes in this setting [3]. However, randomised data of equivalence or indeed superiority are lacking. Furthermore, questions remain as the timing and role of systemic therapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation when SABR is used in this setting. In advanced SCLC, many tumors display neuroendocrine clinical and cytological features and many SCLC tumors express somatostatin receptor and this can be imaged using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs such as <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE [4]. Given the uptake by some SCLC tumors of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE, higher doses of the tracer have been used in an attempt to provide radiolabelled radiotherapy treatment in metastatic disease in what has been described as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) [5]. This molecularly target radiotherapy is a potentially exciting therapeutic approach, but the ideal positioning of such therapy in tumors which are suitable for treatment with PRRT and the safety of PRRT with systemic therapy have yet to be determined.

Fifty-one patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) were treated with alternating urokinase (UK)-cyclophosphamide- doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH)-vincristine and cisplatin-etoposide-vincristine. UK was given as a loading dose of 3000 mug/kg body weight, followed by 3000 mug/kg/h for 6 hours. Thoracic irradiation with split technique (46 Gy) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (25 Gy) were administered to responding patients. A second staging was performed in patients exhibiting a clinical complete response (CR) after 1 year. Results. In 27 patients with limited disease, there were 23 CR and 8 partial responses (PR) (CR, 85.1%; 66.2-95.8% at 95% confidence intervals); in 24 patients with extensive disease, there were 17 CR, 4 PR, and 3 cases with progression. Pathologically proven CR were observed in 59.2% patients with limited disease and 33.3% patients with extensive disease. Survival rates were as follows: in patients with limited disease, 1 year, 85.1%; 2 years, 55.5%; and 3 years, 25.9%; in patients with extensive disease, 1 year, 54.1; and 2 years, 16.9%. Median survival times were 26.3 months (patients with limited disease) and 13.3 months (patients with extensive disease). UK- related toxic effects included four episodes of mild to moderate bleeding, one allergic reaction, and one cerebrovascular accident.

3291,"Combined endoscopic endonasal surgery and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (fSRS) for complex cranial base tumors-early clinical outcomes Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has been shown to be a feasible approach to cranial base tumors while reducing post-operative morbidity. Using the endoscopic endonasal approach alone or in combination with open approaches may provide advantages over conventional approaches. However, the balance between maximal resection and minimal injury to neurovascular structures frequently precludes gross total resection (GTR). Consequently, adjuvant radiation therapy may be an important option to improve local control (LC) of residual disease. In this retrospective series, we report clinical outcomes, morbidity, and LC of 40 patients with cranial base tumors treated with EES +/- combined open approach followed by fSRS (CyberKnife, Accuray Inc.). 26 patients had benign disease, 7 had newly diagnosed malignant disease, and 7 had previously resected malignant disease. Surgical outcomes were evaluable in all patients. LC after fSRS was evaluable in 39 patients and defined as no evidence of regrowth by MRI, CT, & physical examination. GTR was achieved in 12/40. Median post-operative length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. In multivariable analysis controlling for anatomic location and malignant histology, post-operative complications (n = 10) were significantly associated with patients having combined open and EES (p < 0.01, OR = 16.9). SRS was delivered in 1-5 sessions to a median marginal dose of 24.9 Gy. Median follow-up was 24.7 months (range, 1.5 to 61 months). LC was achieved in 89.7% (35/39) of evaluable patients. LC was achieved in 11/12 patients who had GTR. Median progression-free survival was 19.7 months (21.0 months for benign tumors (n = 26), 5.8 months for previously resected malignant disease (n = 7), and 21.2 months for newly diagnosed malignant disease (n = 7). Of the 31 patients who had symptomatic disease at presentation, 18 (58%) reported complete symptom resolution, 9 partial, and 4 no improvement. One patient who received two prior courses of radiation therapy developed osteosclerosis (grade III). Other adverse events were erythema (grade I, n = 5), nausea (grade II, n = 2), conjunctivitis (grade II, n = 1). EES followed by fSRS is a safe and effective management strategy for selected cranial base tumors. EES combined with an open surgical approach may result in increased complications.

588,"Synthesis and characterization of novel substituted thiophene derivatives and discovery of their carbonic anhydrase and acetylcholinesterase inhibition effects Novel substituted thiophene derivatives (1, 2a-e, 3, and 4) were synthesized and their structures were characterized by infrared radiation, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass analysis. These novel substituted thiophene derivatives were effective inhibitor compounds of the carbonic anhydrase I and II isozymes (hCA I and II), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme with K <sub>i</sub> values in the range of 447.28 to 1004.65 nM for hCA I, 309.44 to 935.93 nM for hCA II, and 0.28 to 4.01 nM for AChE, respectively. Novel substituted thiophene derivatives can be good candidate drugs for the treatment of some diseases like neurological disorders, epilepsy, glaucoma, gastric and duodenal ulcers, mountain sickness, or osteoporosis as carbonic anhydrase isozymes inhibitors, and for the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.",Excluded

1158,"Dietary instead of pharmacological management to counter the adverse effects of physiological adaptations to space flight The development of pharmacological counter-measures to the adverse effects of physiological adaptation to microgravity has received relatively more attention than alternatives such as dietary management. The manipulation of dietary cation-anion balance, and its subsequent effects on acid-base metabolism, have been routinely used for some time in managing domestic animal health. More recently, dietary intake by humans of alkalinizing potassium salts has been demonstrated to exert profound beneficial effects on calcium balance, bone mineralization, predisposition to calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, and overall nitrogen balance. Dietary sodium restriction has also been shown to improve calcium balance, bone mineralization, and the effectiveness of neurohumoral defenses against orthostatic hypotension. It is proposed that these simple alterations in the astronauts' diets may be easily implemented to lessen the adverse effects of physiological adaptations to space flight, and to enhance or even replace prescribed pharmacological counter-measures.

3054,"Initial clinical experience of a prototype ultra-high-resolution CT for assessment of small intracranial arteries Purpose: Diagnostic and neurosurgical procedures require the precise localization of small intracranial arteries, but this may be difficult using conventional computed tomography angiography (CTA). This study was conducted to evaluate the quality of CTA images acquired using a prototype ultra-high-resolution computed tomography (U-HRCT) system compared with those acquired using a conventional computed tomography (C-CT) system. Material(s) and Method(s): From July through September 2015, 10 adult patients (6 women and 4 men) previously scanned by C-CT were examined using U-HRCT to locate and assess cerebral aneurysms. The bilateral ophthalmic artery (Opth A), anterior choroidal artery (Acho A), and thalamoperforating arteries (TPAs) were visually evaluated in randomly presented CTA images. Images were graded on a 5-point scale, and differences in scores between U-HRCT and C-CT were evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Visual evaluation scores for images of the Opth A, Acho A, and TPAs were significantly higher for U-HRCT than for C-CT. U-HRCT images achieved good visualization (score > 3) for C-CT images with poor visualization (score < 3) in 66.7-100% of all the small arteries. Conclusion(s): U-HRCT is superior to C-CT for detecting and evaluating clinically significant small intracranial arteries. Copyright Â© 2019, Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded
1974,"[The effective dosage as the stimulating exposure in fractionated gamma irradiation] The study of early neurological disturbances (END) in rats after fractionated gamma irradiation with doses of 37.5-225 Gy at dose rate of 30.11 Gy/min has demonstrated that the initial response of animals to pulse ionizing radiation is a function of the electric charge induced by ionizing radiation. A change in the probability of occurrence of each of the END symptoms, with the increased intervals between exposures, is merely an indirect indication of the eliminating mechanisms and is intricately connected with the irritating charge value. The period of dose half-elimination in 16 min. The threshold effective dose rate leading to END is of the order of 2.12 Gy/min. The proposed empiric relationships permit to correlate the probability of END symptom occurrence with the continuous quantitative parameter of fractionated irradiation, that is, with an effective dose as an analogue of the irritating effect.",Included
1917,"Strategy and clinical results for intracranial nongerminomatous germ cell tumors induced intensive chemotherapy Purpose: It is well known that an intracranial non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCT), especially poor prognosis group which demonstrated high level of serum tumor marker has poor prognosis due to CSF dissemination or local recurrence. The objective of this study was to determine whether the combination of surgery and intensive chemotherapy was effective in patients with poor prognosis group of intracranial NGGCT. Patient(s): Since 1998, we have had 24 patients with an intracranial NGGCT. These consisted of an intermediate group (IG) with 10 cases, and a poor group (PG) with 14 cases. NAT (neo-adjuvant therapy), which is preceding chemotherapy before surgery, was performed in 11 cases which presented with serum b-HCG of over 500 mIU/ml or AFP 500 ng/ml and a reduced teratoma component in neuro-imagings. Radical surgery was done in another 13 cases. The chemotherapy regimen was CARE (carboplatin, etoposide) for IG. Since 2006, we have shifted the chemotherapy from ICE regimen (ifosfamide, cisplatin, etoposide) (8 cases) to the JCO2004 regimen (cisplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, carboplatin) (6 cases) to strengthen chemotherapy for PG followed by reduced dose of radiation. Result(s): The total follow-up period was 6.7 years. Two patients showed rapid tumor growth after chemotherapy in so called ""growing teratoma syndrome."" Four patients in NAT (40%) demonstrated complete remission after only chemotherapy. In PG, five of eight in ICE (62%) died (recurrence: 4, radiation induced glioblastoma: 1), none showed tumor recurrence in the JCO 2004 regimen. All patients in IG survived without tumor recurrence. The 3-year, 5-year and 10 year survival rate of PG was 68%, 68% and 51%, respectively.

1518,"Synchrotron-based in vivo tracking of implanted mammalian cells We have developed an X-ray imaging protocol that permits 3D visualisation of a small number of implanted cells within bulk tissue. The cells are marked using natural endocytosis of inert gold nano-particles. The resulting local increase in electron density allows high imaging contrast to be obtained from small clusters of these marked cells. Using this technique we have imaged C6 glioma cells within the brain of a model animal. The cells were marked by exposing them to colloidal gold incorporated in the growth media. Gold-loaded glioma cells were implanted into the brains of adult male Wistar rats. After tumours had been allowed to develop for up to 2 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and images of the intact cranium were acquired at the SYRMEP imaging station on the Elettra synchrotron in Italy. Computed tomography was performed using mixed absorption and phase contrast techniques at an X-ray energy of 24 keV. In the resulting volume datasets the tumour bulk is clearly visible and the infiltrating nature of the malignant growth is well demonstrated. Although the protocol was developed using this particular model of malignant brain tumour, it is believed that it will be possible to use it with other cell lines. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

3372,"Mobile Lower Body Negative Pressure Suit as an Integrative Countermeasure for Spaceflight BACKGROUND: Persistent headward fluid shift and mechanical unloading cause neuro-ocular, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal deconditioning during long-term spaceflight. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) reintroduces footward fluid shift and mechanical loading. METHOD(S): We designed, built, and tested a wearable, mobile, and flexible LBNP device (GravitySuit) consisting of pressurized trousers with built-in shoes to support ground reaction forces (GRF) and a thoracic vest to distribute load to the entire axial length of the body. In eight healthy subjects we recorded GRF under the feet and over the shoulders (Tekscan) while assessing cardiovascular response (Nexfin) and footward fluid shift from internal jugular venous cross-sectional area (IJVa) using ultrasound (Terason). RESULT(S): Relative to normal bodyweight (BW) when standing upright, increments of 10 mmHg LBNP from 0 to 40 mmHg while supine induced axial loading corresponding to 0%, 13 +/- 3%, 41 +/- 5%, 75 +/- 11%, and 125 +/- 22% BW, respectively. Furthermore, LBNP reduced IJVa from 1.12 +/- 0.3 cm2 to 0.67 +/- 0.2, 0.50 +/- 0.1, 0.35 +/- 0.1, and 0.31 +/- 0.1 cm2, respectively. LBNP of 30 and 40 mmHg reduced cardiac stroke volume and increased heart rate while cardiac output and mean arterial pressure were unaffected. During 2 h of supine rest at 20 mmHg LBNP, temperature and humidity inside the suit were unchanged (23 +/- 1degreeC; 47 +/- 3%, respectively).DISCUSSION: The flexible GravitySuit at 20 mmHg LBNP comfortably induced mechanical loading and desired fluid displacement while maintaining the mobility of hips and knee joints. The GravitySuit may provide a feasible method to apply low-level, long-term LBNP without interfering with daily activity during spaceflight to provide an integrative countermeasure.Petersen LG, Hargens A, Bird EM, Ashari N, Saalfeld J, Petersen JCG.

351,"The effect of induced intraocular straylight on perimetric tests PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of intraocular straylight (IOS) on threshold measurements made by four types of perimetry: standard automated perimetry (SAP), frequency-doubling technology (FDT) perimetry, flicker-defined form (FDF) perimetry, and the Moorfields Motion Displacement Test (MDT).METHODS: Six healthy young (21-29 years) psychophysically experienced observers were tested five times with each perimeter, each time with one of five different white opacity filters (WOFs), to induce various levels of IOS. Each WOF gave rise to an increase in IOS, measured with a straylight meter, of between 10% and 200% from baseline and ranging in effect from normal ageing to significant cataract. The change in sensitivity from baseline was normalized, allowing comparison of standardized (z) scores (change divided by the standard deviation of normative values) for each instrument.RESULTS: Average SAP, FDT, and FDF thresholds were significantly affected (P < 0.001) by moderate to large increases in IOS (50%-200%), whereas MDT remained largely unaffected over the same range of straylight levels.CONCLUSIONS: The Moorfields MDT shows greater resilience to the effects of additional straylight compared with SAP, FDT, or FDF.",Excluded
1155,"Evidence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and identification of dying cells in X-ray-induced cell death in the developing brain Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of 2 Gy X-rays and were killed 6 hr later. Dying cells were characterized by extreme chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Dying cells were distributed in the primary and secondary germinal zones and in other brain regions. Among these latter, dying cells occurred in the cortical layers of the olfactory bulb, layers II-III and VIb of the neocortex, piriform and entorhinal cortex, stratum oriens and pyramidale of the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, brainstem, internal granular layer of the cerebellum, and cerebral and cerebellar white matter. Dying cells were immature cells, neurons and glial cells (including radial glia). In-situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation identified individual cells bearing fragmented DNA. Since the number of cells stained with this method was larger than the number of dying cells, as revealed with current histological techniques, it is suggested that nuclear DNA fragmentation precedes chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in X-ray-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, agarose gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA from irradiated brains showed a ""ladder"" pattern which is typical of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and endonuclease activation.",Excluded

3090,"Repeated cocaine administration increases voltage-sensitive calcium currents in response to membrane depolarization in medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a critical role in cocaine addiction. However, evidence to elucidate how the mPFC is functionally involved in cocaine addiction remains incomplete. Recent studies have revealed that repeated cocaine administration induces various neuroadaptations in pyramidal mPFC neurons, including a reduction in voltage-gated K+ currents (VGKCs) and a possible increase in voltage-sensitive Ca2+ currents (I(Ca)). Here, we performed both current-clamp recordings in brain slices and voltage-clamp recordings in freshly dissociated cells to determine whether I(Ca) is altered in mPFC pyramidal neurons after chronic cocaine treatment with a short-term or long-term withdrawal. In addition, a critical role of VGKCs in regulating the generation of Ca2+ plateau potential was also studied in mPFC neurons. Repeated cocaine administration significantly prolonged the duration of evoked Ca2+ plateau potentials and increased the whole-cell I(Ca) in mPFC neurons after a 3 d withdrawal. Selective blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels by nifedipine not only significantly increased the threshold but also reduced the duration and amplitude of Ca2+ plateau potentials in both saline- and cocaine-withdrawn mPFC neurons. However, there was no significant difference in the increased threshold, reduced duration, and decreased amplitude of Ca2+ potentials between saline- and cocaine-withdrawn neurons after blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels. Moreover, an increase in amplitude was also observed, whereas the prolonged duration persisted, in Ca2+ potentials after 2-3 weeks of withdrawal. These findings indicate that chronic exposure to cocaine facilitates the responsiveness of I(Ca), particularly via the activated L-type Ca2+ channels, to excitatory stimuli in rat mPFC pyramidal neurons.",Excluded
3192,"Evaluation of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other tremors: Survival of neurons adjacent to the thalamic lesion after gamma thalamotomy Object. The effects of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other kinds of tremor were evaluated. Methods. Thirty-six thalamotomies were performed in 31 patients by using a 4-mm collimator. The maximum dose was 150 Gy in the initial six cases, which was reduced to 130 Gy thereafter. The longest follow-up period was 6 years. The target was determined on T<inf>2</inf>-weighted and proton magnetic resonance (MR) images. The point chosen was in the lateral-most part of the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus. This is in keeping with open thalamotomy as practiced at the authors' institution. In 15 cases, gamma thalamotomy was the first surgical procedure. In other cases, previous therapeutic or vascular lesions were visible to facilitate targeting. Two types of tissue reaction were onserved on MR imaging: a simple oval shape and a complex irregular shape. Neither of these changes affected the clinical course. In the majority of cases, the tremor subsided after a latent interval of approximately 1 year after irradiation. The earliest response was demonstrated at 3 months. In five cases the tremor remained. In four of these cases, a second radiation session was administered. One of these four patients as well as another patient with an unsatisfactory result underwent open thalamotomy with microrecording. In both cases, depth recording adjacent to the necrotic area revealed normal neuronal activity, including the rhythmic discharge of tremor. Minor coagulation was performed and resulted in immediate and complete arrest of the remaining tremor. Conclusions. Gamma thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease seems to be an alternative useful method in selected cases.",Excluded
2584,"Identification of tumor precursor cells in the brains of primates with radiation-induced de novo glioblastoma multiforme The pathogenesis of de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is poorly understood and precursor cells are not known. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of GBM we analyzed brains from primates that developed de novo tumors ten years after whole brain radiation. Four animals had clinical and radiological evidence of GBM, and two animals had no evidence of GBM at the time of euthanization. Tumor precursor cells were identified diffusely scattered in the grossly normal white matter of all animals including two monkeys without evidence of GBM by MR-imaging or on autopsy examination. Tumor precursors demonstrated cellular atypia and mitoses, and were negative for tumor-associated markers GFAP, EGFR and p53. The cells were positive for Ki67 and N-CoR, the nuclear corepressor of astroglial differentiation. These results suggest that radiation-induced nuclear damage to neural stem cells or early astrocytic precursor cells can prevent normal differentiation and lead to tumor development. The findings provide insight into the tumorigenesis of de novo GBMs and suggest a new strategy for treatment of these lethal tumors by targeting both inactivation of N-CoR and inhibition of EGFR.",Included
2736,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and alzheimer's disease Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy age-matched controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Rates of decline were -0.028 FA units per year in FTLD in the genu of the CC, and -0.017 FA units per year in AD in splenium of the CC. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD.",Excluded

All animals received 5 daily injections (1.8 mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine. For tumor-bearing animals, the BBB disruption was confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI. Animals from the tumor and radiation group underwent radiotherapy in 6 fractions of 5 Gray. The SI ratio between DCN and brain stem was evaluated on T1-weigthed MRI at baseline and 1 week after the last administration. Subsequently, the brain was dissected for gadolinium quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was done with the Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTS: An increased but similar DCN/brain stem SI ratio was found for all three groups (p = 0.14). The gadolinium tissue concentrations (median, nmol/g) were 6.7 (tumor), 6.3 (radiotherapy), and 6.8 (control) in the cerebellum (p = 0.64) and 17.8/14.6 (tumor), 20.0/18.9 (radiotherapy), and 17.8/15.9 (control) for the primary tumor (p = 0.98) and the contralateral hemisphere (p = 0.41) of the cerebrum, respectively.CONCLUSION: An experimental brain tumor treated by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone did not alter DCN signal hyperintensity and gadolinium concentration in the rat brain 1 week after repeated administration of gadopentetate.

Seventy-eight patients had tumor (34 with previous RT), and 22 had radiation injury. Severe pain occurred in 80% of tumor patients but in only 19% of patients with radiation injury. The lower trunk (C7-8, T1) was involved in 72% of the tumors, and 32% also had epidural tumors. Seventy-eight percent of the radiation injuries affected the upper plexus (C5-6). Horner syndrome was more common in tumor, and lymphedema in radiation injury. The time from RT to onset of plexus symptoms, and the dose of RT, also differed. For symptoms within 1 year of RT, doses exceeding 6000 R were associated with radiation damage, whereas lower doses were associated with infiltration. Therefore, painless upper trunk lesions with lymphedema suggest radiation injury, and painful lower trunk lesions with Horner syndrome imply tumor infiltration.",Excluded

The changes observed included persistence of the perisomatic processes beyond the 10th postnatal day, multiple primary dendrites, angulation of the primary dendrites, long segments of primary dendrites without branches and significantly reduced dendritic volume. The number of affected cells was less on the 21st postnatal day. The effective radiation dose estimated in these groups ranged from 15 to 26 rad.

Method(s): Single-center retrospective cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with an incidental intracranial meningioma (2007-2015). Outcomes recorded were postintervention morbidity, histopathologic diagnosis, and treatment response. Result(s): Out of 441 patients, 44 underwent treatment. Median age at intervention was 56.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 49.6-66.5); patients included 35 women and 9 men. The main indication for imaging was headache (25.9%). Median meningioma volume was 4.55 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR, 1.91-8.61), and the commonest location was convexity (47.7%). Six patients underwent surgery at initial diagnosis. Thirty-eight had intervention (34 with surgery and 4 with radiotherapy) after a median active monitoring duration of 24 months (IQR, 11.8-42.0). Indications for treatment were radiologic progression (n = 26), symptom development (n = 6), and patient preference (n = 12). Pathology revealed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 meningioma in 36 patients and WHO grade 2 in 4 patients.

2256,"A review of management strategies of malignant gliomas in the elderly population Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumor in adults. It is an aggressive primary brain neoplasm, associated with a poor prognosis and median survival of less than 1 year. Approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with malignant gliomas in the United States are over the age of 65. Advancing age and poor performance status are two variables that have found to negatively affect prognosis. When compared to younger patients, not only is the treatment of elderly patients associated with decreased efficacy but also greater toxicity. As a result, elderly patients often receive less aggressive treatment and are excluded from clinical trials. There are many challenges in the treatment of elderly patients with GBM including increased surgical morbidity and mortality as well as increased toxicity to radiation and chemotherapy. As such, the optimal therapy remains unclear and controversial for the elderly malignant glioma population.",Excluded

There was a pattern of increasing incidence during treatment for the most commonly reported symptoms: fatigue (33%-93%), skin changes (36%-100%), sensation changes (28%-79%), and breast swelling (11%-38%), with gradual improvement over the following 3 months. Sleep problems were reported by nearly half of the subjects during and after treatment. Severity ratings of symptoms were mild to moderate but significantly higher by the end of therapy (P </= .01). There were no significant differences in psychological mood states during or after treatment except for the fatigue subscale (P </= .05). These findings will assist the nurse in preparing women for predictable symptoms during and after a course of breast irradiation and direct assessment, and provide data to support evidence-based interventions to minimize symptom distress.",Excluded
2316,"Short and long-term evaluation of the impact of proton minibeam radiation therapy on motor, emotional and cognitive functions Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most frequently used methods for cancer treatment. Despite remarkable advancements in RT techniquesthe treatment of radioresistant tumours (i.e. high-grade gliomas) is not yet satisfactory. Finding novel approaches less damaging for normal tissues is of utmost importance. This would make it possible to increase the dose applied to tumours, resulting in an improvement in the cure rate. Along this line, proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) is a novel strategy that allows the spatial modulation of the dose, leading to minimal damage to brain structures compared to a high dose (25 Gy in one fraction) of standard proton therapy (PT). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether pMBRT also preserves important cerebral functions. Comprehensive longitudinal behavioural studies were performed in irradiated (peak dose of 57 Gy in one fraction) and control rats to evaluate the impact of pMBRT on motor function (motor coordination, muscular tonus, and locomotor activity), emotional function (anxiety, fear, motivation, and impulsivity), and cognitive function (learning, memory, temporal processing, and decision making). The evaluations, which were conducted over a period of 10 months, showed no significant motor or emotional dysfunction in pMBRT-irradiated rats compared with control animals. Concerning cognitive functions, similar performance was observed between the groups, although some slight learning delays might be present in some of the tests in the long term after irradiation. This study shows the minimal impact of pMBRT on the normal brain at the functional level.",Included
2270,"Risk Factor for Incident Functional Disability and the Effect of a Preventive Exercise Program: A 4-Year Prospective Cohort Study of Older Survivors from the Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the risk factors for incident functional disability among long-term evacuees of Iitate village after Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear disaster (GEJE). We also investigated the effectiveness of exercise classes as an intervention measure in this situation.METHODS: 1159 subjects (75.2 +/- 5.8 years, 57.5% female) were included at baseline, and followed-up for four years. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of incident functional disability according to the presence of risk factors evaluated by the municipality&rsquo;s self-assessment Basic Checklist (BCL). Evacuees from Iitate who participated in the exercise classes and those who did not were matched using the propensity scores, which were then used to obtain the HR of incident functional disability.RESULTS: New functional disability occurred in 280 (24.2%) participants during the follow-up. Participants who scored negative for the &ldquo;Physical function&rdquo; domain in the BCL had a HR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.54-2.69) for incident functional disability when compared to those who scored positive for this domain. Similarly, the HR for &ldquo;Cognitive function&rdquo; was 1.37 (CI: 1.06-1.77), and 1.60 (CI: 1.24-2.08) for &ldquo;Depression&rdquo;. Using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, both the group with low-participation in the exercise program and the group with high-participation in the exercise program had a significantly lower rate of incident functional disability compared to those who did not participate at all (HR = 0.27, CI: 0.16-0.46; HR = 0.30, CI: 0.12-0.74, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Pre-disaster BCL domains were useful to identify individuals at risk of functional disability after a major socio-technical disaster. Therefore, this instrument can be used to identify at-risk older adults who would benefit from early exercise programs to prevent incident functional disability.",Included
252,"Resistance exercise prevents plantar flexor deconditioning during bed rest Because resistance exercise (REX) and unloading induce opposing neuromuscular adaptations, we tested the efficacy of REX against the effects of 14 d of bed rest unloading (BRU) on the plantar flexor muscle group. Sixteen men were randomly assigned to no exercise (NOE, N = 8) or REX (N = 8). REX performed 5 sets x 6-10 repetitions to failure of constant resistance concentric/eccentric plantar flexion every other day during BRU. One-repetition maximum (1RM) strength was tested on the training device. The angle-specific torque-velocity relationship across 5 velocities (0, 0.52, 1.05, 1.75, and 2.97 rad.s-1) and the full range-of-motion power-velocity relationship were assessed on a dynamometer. Torque-position analyses identified strength changes at shortened, neutral, and stretched muscle lengths. Concentric and eccentric contractile work were measured across ten repetitions at 1.05 rad.s-1. Maximal neural activation was measured by surface electromyography (EMG). 1RM decreased 9% in NOE and improved 11% in REX (P < 0.05). Concentric (0.52 and 1.05 rad.s-1), eccentric (0.52 and 2.97 rad.s-1), and isometric angle-specific torques decreased (P < 0.05) in NOE, averaging 18%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. Power dropped (P < 0.05) in NOE at three eccentric (21%) and two concentric (14%) velocities. REX protected angle-specific torque and average power at all velocities. Concentric and eccentric strength decreased at stretched (16%) and neutral (17%) muscle lengths (P < 0.05) in NOE while REX maintained or improved strength at all joint positions. Concentric (15%) and eccentric (11%) contractile work fell in NOE (P < 0.05) but not in REX. Maximal plantar flexor EMG did not change in either group. In summary, constant resistance concentric/eccentric REX completely prevented plantar flexor performance deconditioning induced by BRU. The reported benefits of REX should prove useful in prescribing exercise for astronauts in microgravity and for patients susceptible to functional decline during bed- or chair-bound hospital stays.",Excluded
1455,"Monitoring Dynamic Morphological Changes with Electrocardiography-Gated Dynamic 4-Dimensional Computed Tomography Angiography to Predict Intraoperative Rupture of Intracranial Aneurysms Objective This study aims to evaluate dynamic morphological changes of intracranial aneurysms to predict intraoperative aneurysm rupture (IAR) during clipping. Methods Included in this study were 153 patients, who had ruptured and microsurgical-clipped aneurysms. All patients underwent dual-source computed tomography examination of electrocardiography-gated dynamic 4-dimensional computed tomography angiography before clipping. Original scanning data were reconstructed to produce 20 data sets of cardiac cycles with 5% time intervals. The aneurysm neck, transverse and longitudinal diameters, and volume from the 20 groups of images were measured to calculate their respective change rates. In addition, other data and clinical characteristics were recorded. Data were analyzed by logistic regression to identify factors associated with IAR. Results Of the 153 patients, 24 patients experienced IAR. Multivariable analysis revealed that the aneurysm neck change rate (P = 0.0001; odds ratio, 1.276) and aspect ratio (height/neck ratio, P = 0.025; odds ratio, 2.387) are predictors for IAR. When the change rate was greater than or equal to 60%, and the sensitivity and specificity were 91.7% and 76.7%, respectively. Conclusions Aneurysm neck change rate is independent predictor of IAR.

1800,"Effects of Radiation Exposure on the Cost-Effectiveness of CT Angiography and Perfusion Imaging in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT angiography and perfusion imaging is an important prognostic tool in the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of advanced imaging in patients with SAH, incorporating the risks of radiation exposure from CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The risks of radiation-induced brain cancer and cataracts were incorporated into our established decision model comparing the cost-effectiveness of CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging and transcranial Doppler sonography in SAH. Cancer risk was calculated by using National Cancer Institute methodology. The remaining input probabilities were based on literature data and a cohort at our institution. Outcomes were expected quality-adjusted life years gained, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging were the dominant strategies, resulting in both better health outcomes and lower costs, even when incorporating brain cancer and cataract risks. Our results remained robust in 2-way sensitivity analyses varying the prolonged latency period up to 30 years, with either brain cancer risk up to 50 times higher than the upper 95% CI limit or the probability of cataracts from 0 to 1. Results were consistent for scenarios that considered either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with SAH. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed our findings over a broad range of selected input parameters.CONCLUSIONS: While risks of radiation exposure represent an important consideration, CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging remained the preferred imaging compared with transcranial Doppler sonography in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SAH, with improved health outcomes and lower health care costs, even when modeling a significantly higher risk and shorter latency period for both cataract and brain cancer than that currently known.",Excluded
3006,"Glutamate transporters regulate extrasynaptic NMDA receptor modulation of Kv2.1 potassium channels Delayed-rectifier Kv2.1 potassium channels regulate somatodendritic excitability during periods of repetitive, high-frequency activity. Recent evidence suggests that Kv2.1 channel modulation is linked to glutamatergic neurotransmission. Because NMDA-type glutamate receptors are critical regulators of synaptic plasticity, we investigated NMDA receptor modulation of Kv2.1 channels in rodent hippocampus and cortex. Bath application of NMDA potently unclustered and dephosphorylated Kv2.1 and produced a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependent activation of voltage-sensitive potassium currents (I(K)). In contrast, driving synaptic activity in Mg2+-free media to hyperactivate synaptic NMDA receptors had no effect on Kv2.1 channels, and moderate pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure activity in adult mice did not dephosphorylate hippocampal Kv2.1 channels. Selective activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors unclustered and dephosphorylated Kv2.1 channels and produced a hyperpolarizing shift in neuronal I(K). In addition, inhibition of glutamate uptake rapidly activated NMDA receptors and dephosphorylated Kv2.1 channels. These observations demonstrate that regulation of intrinsic neuronal activity by Kv2.1 is coupled to extrasynaptic but not synaptic NMDA receptors. These data support a novel mechanism for glutamate transporters in regulation of neuronal excitability and plasticity through extrasynaptic NMDA receptor modulation of Kv2.1 channels.",Excluded
1998,"Recent advances in neuro-imaging and the impact on neuro-ophthalmology Neuro-imaging is an essential part of the evaluation in patients with neuro-ophthalmologic disorders. Over the last two decades enormous advances in this area have been made allowing noninvasive evaluation of the orbit and brain. The idea of using nuclear magnetic resonance technology to produce images rather than the ionizing radiation of computed tomography (CT) began to emerge clinically in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Although the quality of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was not much better than CT images, by the early 1990s, it became obvious that MRI had particular strength in identifying lesions in the posterior fossa, and demyelinating plaques. With advances in magnetic strength, computer software, surface coils, contrast medium, and more attention to the basic physics of magnet technology, the clarity of MR images improved dramatically. Recent advances in CT scanning (spiral and three-dimensional CT) and MRI (functional MRI and cine MRI) continue to affect significant changes in the discipline of neuro-ophthalmology. Furthermore, advances in MR angiography promise to allow excellent and noninvasive analysis of the cerebral vasculature. This review highlights the recent advances in neuro-imaging.

600,"What is the role of combined chemoradiotherapy for grade III glioma in adults? Classification, prognosis and treatment of grade III glioma is now determined predominantly by molecular biomarkers, with 1p19q chromosomal co-deletion conferring a clear prognostic benefit and also being associated with better response to chemotherapy. The importance of this molecular biomarker is reflected in the updated WHO classification of central nervous system tumours that was published in 2016. Long term data from two large, randomised trials have shown that patients with 1p19q co-deleted anaplastic oligodendrogliomas derive significant survival benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy. More recent data from the NOA-04 study indicate that primary chemotherapy is not superior to primary radiotherapy in any molecular subgroup of anaplastic glioma and hence do not support the concept of 'delayed radiotherapy' in these patients. Despite the documented association of chemosensitivity with 1p19q co-deletion, a recent planned interim analysis of the CATNON study revealed that patients with anaplastic astrocytomas with inatct 1p19q chromosomal regions also derive significant benefit from the addition of adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy. It is not yet known whether the use of temozolomide concomitant with radiotherapy confers additional benefit; these hotly anticipated data are not expected to be available for at least two years. Hence, all patients with grade III gliomas appear to benefit from both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with maximum survival benefit being achieved by 'early' rather than 'delayed' treatment. A number of questions remain, including the optimum scheduling of these treatments and the optimum radiotherapy regime for the different molecular subtypes. The question of radiation dose and volume is particularly important for this group of patients in whom long term survival can be anticipated and the risks and potential impact of neurotoxicity are significant. Strategies to reduce the long term neurocognitive impact of radiotherapy in these patients should be developed and incorporated into future clinical trials.",Excluded
1347,"Enhancement of dosimetric optimization for stereotactic radiosurgery. [French] Stereotactic radiosurgery is a technique for treatment of intracranial lesions requiring high precision in all steps - from image acquisition to final irradiation. One of most difficult steps is the treatment planning phase, consisting of determination of irradiation parameters sufficient to cover the target volume by avoiding sensitive volumes. A manual and empirical definition can be very long and difficult, especially in the case of complex target volumes situated in sensitive zones. As in conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery has taken advantages from dosimetric optimization. The question is: 'What is the configuration of irradiation parameters used in order to obtain the treatment plan by satisfying defined constraints?'. The purpose of this article is to summarize optimization methods used in radiosurgery and to describe the technical alternatives proposed for this treatment as well as the possibilities of plan evaluation between different techniques. This purpose will be illustrated by the optimization methodology used in the Center Oscar Lambret of Lille, France for the radiosurgical treatment with linear accelerator.",Excluded

The new classifications of patients with brain metastases help guiding treatment more appropriately. Stereotactic radiotherapy has supplanted whole brain radiation therapy both for patients with metastases in place and for those who underwent surgery. Hippocampus protection is possible with intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

In combination with irradiation it has been shown to have an additive effect on growth inhibition in melanoma cells. In this study, the radiosensitizing effect of betulinic acid on sequential irradiation was investigated in HNSCC cell lines. Material(s) and Method(s): Two HNSCC cell lines, SCC9 and SCC25, were treated with increasing doses of betulinic acid and sequentially irradiated with a single boost of 4 Gy from a conventional radiation source. The cells were counted, the surviving fraction was determined, and colony-forming assays were performed. Result(s): It could be shown that betulinic acid alone inhibits cell survival, affects cell survival additively in combination with irradiation and decreases clonogenic survival in both cell lines when applied alone. Conclusion(s): Betulinic acid could be a promising treatment agent in radioresistant head and neck cancer. A combination of betulinic acid with radiotherapy seems to be beneficial.

477,"Single fraction prophylactic cranial irradiation for small cell carcinoma of the lung The effectiveness of a single 8-Gy fraction prophylactic cranial irradiation regime was assessed in 106 patients with small-cell carcinoma of the lung. All patients had limited stage disease and received combination chemotherapy consisting of either cisplatin or carboplatin with ifosfamide, etoposide, and vincristine (VICE). Cranial irradiation was administered 48 h after the first cycle of chemotherapy and was well tolerated. Actual 2-year survival was 35% and cranial relapse occurred in 22% of those patients who achieved complete remission. This compares favourably with a cranial relapse rate of 45% incomplete remitters previously reported with the same chemotherapy regime after a minimum follow-up of 2 years where PCI was not used. Formal psychometric testing was performed retrospectively on a series of 25 long-term survivors of whom 14 were taken from this reported series. Whilst 75% of patients were impaired on at least one test with 68% performing badly in the most complex task, this was not associated with clinically detectable neurological damage and the patients did not complain of memory or concentration difficulties. In conclusion, single fraction PCI, when used with platinum based combination chemotherapy, appears to be equally effective but may be less neurotoxic than the more standard fractionated regimes.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to investigate the implications of immune-related glial cells in a rapid-acting treatment for depression, namely, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Specifically, the effects of electroconvulsive shock (ECS; animal model of ECT) on microglia were morphologically determined in the mouse hippocampus by using ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) immunocytochemistry. For comparison, S100beta-positive astrocytes, another type of glial cells, were also tested. After 24 hours of acute ECS administration, a meshwork of Iba1-positive microglial processes was largely diminished, although the change was transient. In mice that received chronic ECS administration, the decline of Iba1-positive microglial process meshwork continued even 1 month after the last shock. Morphometric image analysis revealed the significant reduction of Iba1-positive microglial process density following ECS administration. On the other hand, neither acute nor chronic ECS administration made alterations in the patterns of expression of S100beta immunoreactivity. No significant changes were detected in the cell surface area of S100beta-positive astrocytes following ECS administration. The optical disector analysis demonstrated that ECS did not affect the numerical densities of Iba1-positive microglia and S100beta-positive astrocytes in the hippocampus.

The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 59.2+/-10.9; 50% were smokers and with history of atopy in 5 of them. Five patients had a cancer (2 cuteneous, 1 hematological, 1 ginecological and 1 neuroendocrine). Diagnosis of RF was made with CT, histology, ultrasonography or MRI (respectively in 10, 3, 2 and 1 patients). Seven patients underwent PET, that showed a pathologic enhancement in retroperitoneal and periaortic lesions. Four patients had an histological diagnosis of IgG4 related disease. Mean duration of follow-up was 33 months. Result(s): At the time of the diagnosis, the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 54.2+/-27.6 ml/min and 14 patients had an impaired renal function. Six patients presented also hydroureteronephrosis that worsened the renal function (mean eGFR 32.2+/-16.9), with ureteral stenting requirement. After resolution of ureteral stenosis there was a significant recovery (mean eGFR 56.9+/-23), comparable to the patient that did not required the stent. Only 1 patient required dialysis for hyperpotassemia before positioning ureteral stent. the mean value of plasmatic IgG was 1638+/-1000 mg/dL (normal range 700-1600 mg/dl), resulting high for 5 patients. The mean IgG4 concentration was 391.6+/-585.8 mg/dL, higher than normal range in 50% of patients. For 12 patients we calculated IgG4/IgG ratio, an index suggested by some authors as a potential tool to discriminate patient with RF linked to IgG4 related disease. Three patients had an IgG4/IgG ratio <8% and 9 patients >8%. In our cohort, the IgG4/IgG ratio presented a direct correlation (p=0,009) with extraperitoneal manifestations of the IgG4 related disease, such as pancreatitis, colangitis, encephalitis and ocular involvement. One patient showed modest eosinophilia and almost 43% of patients had positive antinuclear antibodies. C3 and C4 component fractions were low in 2 patients who had highest levels of IgG4 and IgG4/IgG ratio and severe systemic involvement. Erythrosedimentation rate and C-protein reactive were almost normal (respectively mean values 44.8 mm and 1.63 mg/dl). Conclusion(s): almost all of the patients (87,5 %) showed impaired renal function. Kidney involvement did not seem to be linked just to obstructive uropathy. In fact after stenting, eGFR values were comparable in the 2 groups (obstructed vs not-obstructed). Further evaluations are required to better understand the renal impairment and the physiopathology of RF. Our data would suggest that RF might have a direct impact on renal function probably due to igG4 related disease.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) in achieving a partial or complete remission of so-called radioresistant metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and to propose guidelines for optimal treatment Methods. During a 5-year period, 29 patients (19 male and 10 female) with 92 brain metastases from RCC underwent GKS. The median tumor volume was 4.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 0.5-14.5 cm<sup>3</sup>). Fourteen patients (48%) also underwent whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) before GKS, and two patients (6.8%) after GKS. The mean GKS dose delivered to the 50% isodose at the tumor margin was 16.8 Gy (range 13-30 Gy). All cases were categorized according to the Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification for brain metastases. Univariate analysis was performed to determine significant prognostic factors and survival. The overall median survival was 7 months after GKS treatment.

Prosthetic rehabilitation, particularly in radiated areas, can be particularly difficult in patients with partial or total edentation following treatment for orofacial cancer. We report a series of patients who underwent a protocol of implantation in radiated bone with evaluation of the prosthetic rehabilitation. Material and method. Thirty-three patients given radiotherapy for an orofacial cancer were implanted, followed by a dental prosthesis. The three phases of the protocol were a preoperative clinical and radiological analysis, a surgical phase under general anaesthesia and a postoperative clinical and radiological follow-up. Results. Fifteen patients were treated for an oral cavity tumor, ten for a pharyngeal lesion, six for a laryngeal tumor and two for a maxillary cancer. The average dose of radiotherapy was 60.5 Gy. Sixty-eight implants were positioned, 91.9% in the anterior mandible. The delay between radiotherapy and implantation was 54 months. The delay between implantation and loading was seven months. The average follow-up was 31.9 months. No peri-implantitis was observed. Discussion. Implantation in irradiated bone is possible if a strict protocol is used; a good rate of success and improved quality of life will favour development of this technique. Criteria for dental implant placement include local and general conditions, the psychological situation and technical possibilities. Sufficient delay after radiotherapy is necessary to verify healing and the good prognosis of the cancer. The vascular supply can be preserved by implantation under general anesthesia.

1710,"Prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm for head and neck paragangliomas Purpose/Objective(s): Paragangliomas of the head and neck represent a wide range of predominantly indolent tumors which may cause serious functional deficits if ignored yet its treatment may result in severe iatrogenic morbidity. Surgery and radiation therapy are both established modalities when treatment is warranted but how to integrate these two modalities to optimize tumor control, minimize iatrogenic morbidity and preserve organ function is not clearly established. To this end, a prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm was established at our center over the past decade. Patients were diagnosed by anatomic and functional imaging characteristics typically determined by CT/MRI and octreotide avidity. In general, patients who had a solitary carotid body tumor were offered surgery; while those involving the skull base were offered radiation therapy and those with multiple paragangliomas were offered either surgery for the smaller tumor and radiation for the remaining tumors or radiation for all tumors. Materials/Methods: From 1998-2011, 51 patients (42F:9M) were treated with definitive radiation therapy. Median age was 64 years (range, 19-92 year). Paraganglioma subsites were as follows: jugular 44% (n=24), tympanic 20% (n=11), vagal 15% (n=8), carotid body 13% (n=7), parasympathetic 2% (n=1). Two patients had bilateral tumors, while 2 patients had 3 synchronous tumors. The median radiation dose was 45 Gy (21-50.4 Gy) treated with 3D technique in 72% (n=39), IMRT in 20% (n=11) or SBRT 2% (n=1). During this time period, 38 patients underwent primary surgery of whom 6 received adjuvant radiation therapy. Result(s): At a median follow-up of 34 months (4-103 mos), one patient treated with radiation therapy failed at 37 months for a 3 year actuarial LC 100% and 5 year LC 94%. None of the 38 surgically treated failed. Patients who received radiation therapy experienced grade 1/2 complications including mucositis (13%) or xerostomia (23%), and two patients developed dizziness (5%). Of patients who underwent surgical excision, four patients had post-operative cranial nerve deficits, including vocal fold paresis, Horner's syndrome, hearing loss, and temporary facial nerve weakness. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this experience represents the first prospective algorithmic-based multidisciplinary approach with an emphasis on single modality treatment that demonstrates excellent tumor control, low rates of severe iatrogenic morbidity and long-term function preservation. While both surgery and radiation result in excellent tumor control, radiation therapy should be considered a primary treatment for skull-based paraganglioma for which it offers a high therapeutic ratio.",Excluded

Here, we show the mechanisms and dynamics of Ca2+ and Na+ transients by simultaneous monitoring in Purkinje cell dendrites in mouse cerebellar slices. High frequency parallel fibre stimulation (50 Hz, 3-50-times) depolarized Purkinje cells, and Ca2+ transients were observed at the anatomically expected sites. The magnitude of the Ca2+ transients increased linearly with increasing numbers of parallel fibre inputs. With 50 stimuli, Ca2+ transients lasted for seconds, and the peak [Ca2+] reached approximately 100 microm, which was much higher than that reported previously, although it was still confined to a part of the dendrite. In contrast, Na+ transients were sustained for tens of seconds and diffused away from the stimulated site. Pharmacological interventions revealed that Na+ influx through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and Ca2+ influx through P-type Ca channels were essential players, that AMPA receptors did not operate as a Ca2+ influx pathway and that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through inositol trisphosphate receptors or ryanodine receptors did not contribute greatly to the large Ca2+ transients.",Excluded
3306,"Clinical application of monitoring techniques: radioisotopic methods The availability of mobile gamma cameras or the nearness of nuclear medicine devices to the coronary care unit make the assessment of transient myocardial ischemia by radioisotopic techniques practical. Nuclear cardiology provides information on the presence, site and extent of ischemia and helps the clinician in the evaluation of myocardial functional impairment and recovery. Monitoring of myocardial wall motion by radionuclide ventriculography demonstrates that during angina at rest; global ejection fraction is not always sensitive to regional ischemia; episodes of angina with undetectable electrocardiographic signs of ischemia can be associated with severe myocardial dysfunction; separate left and right phase analysis of radionuclide ventriculography is a sensitive tool to assess segmental dyssynergy localized to the left or the right ventricle; a prevalent right ventricular impairment during ischemia, not measurable by Thallium scintigraphy, is possible; the recovery of function after ischemia is usually fast and apparently complete. In addition, useful diagnostic information can be derived by left ventricular injection of radioactive microspheres during cardiac catheterization followed by gated acquisitions of the intramyocardial radioactivity. Gated microsphere acquisitions, providing diastolic and systolic images, avoid blurring of images due to cardiac motion and enhance contrast between myocardium and background: the overall result is an improved detection and definition of small perfusion defects. Furthermore, this technique permits simultaneous assessment of regional perfusion and wall motion. An appraisal of potential mismatches between flow and function after revascularization procedures can be recognized by this approach. The development of technology is improving the performance of nuclear medicine instrumentation, hampered, at present, by limited spatial and temporal resolution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
3174,"Heterosynaptic co-activation of glutamatergic and dopaminergic afferents is required to induce persistent long-term potentiation The persistence of protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (late-LTP) is thought to require heterosynaptic activation of both glutamate and neuromodulatory receptors in the hippocampus. The present series of experiments contrasts two alternative accounts of heterosynaptic activation. The original version of the synaptic-tag hypothesis of the variable persistence of LTP implied that neuromodulatory and glutamatergic activation could occur independently, albeit within a critical time-window; an alternative view is that there needs to be simultaneous co-activation of both receptors to trigger the up-regulation of relevant protein synthesis (Neuron 34 (2002) 235). Our findings include a replication, over 6 h post-LTP-induction, of earlier findings showing heterosynaptic influences on LTP persistence. Specifically, 'strong' tetanisation with multiple trains of stimulation of one input pathway in a conventional hippocampal slice preparation induces a D1/D5 receptor-dependent form of late-LTP that enables 'weak' tetanic stimulation to induce late-LTP on an independent pathway. However, we also observed that when the first pathway was tetanised in the presence of AP5, not only was no LTP observed on that pathway, but there was also no rescue of late-LTP on the second pathway. Thus, it appears that DA receptors must be co-activated with NMDA receptors in a common pool of neurons to enable LTP persistence, although late-LTP can still be induced by selective activation of glutamatergic synapses if this occurs at time periods shortly before or shortly after this essential coactivation.",Excluded
444,"Solar ultraviolet-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality in the United States, 1993-2002 BACKGROUND: An inverse relationship between solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) exposure and non-skin cancer mortality has long been reported. Vitamin D, acquired primarily through exposure to the sun via the skin, is believed to inhibit tumor development and growth and reduce mortality for certain cancers.METHODS: We extend the analysis of this relationship to include cancer incidence as well as mortality, using higher quality and higher resolution data sets than have typically been available. Over three million incident cancer cases between 1998 and 2002 and three million cancer deaths between 1993 and 2002 in the continental United States were regressed against daily satellite-measured solar UV-B levels, adjusting for numerous confounders. Relative risks of reduced solar UV-B exposure were calculated for thirty-two different cancer sites.RESULTS: For non-Hispanic whites, an inverse relationship between solar UV-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality was observed for ten sites: bladder, colon, Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, other biliary, prostate, rectum, stomach, uterus, and vulva. Weaker evidence of an inverse relationship was observed for six sites: breast, kidney, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreas, and small intestine. For three sites, inverse relationships were seen that varied markedly by sex: esophagus (stronger in males than females), gallbladder (stronger in females than males), and thyroid (only seen in females). No association was found for bone and joint, brain, larynx, liver, nasal cavity, ovary, soft tissue, male thyroid, and miscellaneous cancers. A positive association between solar UV-B exposure and cancer mortality and incidence was found for anus, cervix, oral cavity, melanoma, and other non-epithelial skin cancer.CONCLUSION: This paper adds to the mounting evidence for the influential role of solar UV-B exposure on cancer, particularly for some of the less-well studied digestive cancers. The relative risks for cancer incidence are similar to those for cancer mortality for most sites. For several sites (breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, other biliary, vulva), the relative risks of mortality are higher, possibly suggesting that the maintenance of adequate vitamin D levels is more critical for limiting tumor progression than for preventing tumor onset. Our findings are generally consistent with the published literature, and include three cancer sites not previously linked with solar UV-B exposure, to our knowledge: leukemia, small intestine, and vulva.",Excluded
1371,"Clinical significance of downstaging in patients treated with chemoradiotherapy for limited-disease small cell lung cancer Background: Limited-disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC) patients who do not achieve complete remission (CR) have a considerable relapse rate. The change of tumor burden after treatment can be related with prognosis, the change of TNM stage may influence the outcome of treatment. We investigated the impact of downstaging on overall survival (OS) in LD-SCLC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the 210 LD-SCLC patients, who were treated with CRT at Seoul National University Hospital from Apr 1999 to Nov 2012. The relationship between downstaging and OS was analyzed, and subgroup analysis on the responders was performed. Result(s): Patients showing CR, partial remission (PR), and stable disease (SD)/progressive disease (PD) were 37.1% (n=78), 46.2% (n=97), and 16.7% (n=35), respectively. The median OS for CR, PR, and SD/PD were 47.9 months (mo), 21.8 mo, and 11.2 mo, respectively (P <0.001). Patients showing downstaging and no change/upstaging were 61.5% (n=129) and 38.5% (n=81), respectively. The median OS for downstaging and no change/upstaging were 36.5 mo and 14.4 mo, respectively (P <0.001). Among the 97 patients achieving PR, OS were statistically differed by downstaging (26.0 mo in patients with downstaging and 17.7 mo in patients without downstaging [P =0.021]). In the multivariate analyses, female, downstaging, lower initial TNM stage, and prophylactic cranial irradiation were independent good prognostic factors for OS. Conclusion(s): Downstaging was independent prognostic factor in LD-SCLC. Especially, downstaging is useful for further stratification of patients achieving PR. Additional treatments after CRT may be needed for the patients who achieving PR without downstaging.",Excluded
1308,"Late rectal symptoms and quality of life after conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was carried out in order to analyze the prevalence of late rectal and anal symptoms after conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer and to assess their association with quality of life.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-hundred and forty nine patients were interviewed at 24-111 months after definitive conformal radiation therapy of localized prostate cancer with a median dose of 70 Gy. Rectal symptoms and fecal incontinence were evaluated with standardized questionnaires. Quality of life was assessed with the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 and the prostate cancer module PR25.RESULTS: Rectal symptoms were mostly intermittent. Daily symptoms occurred in < or =5% of the patients. Incontinence was mostly mild with only 3% of the patients reporting daily incontinence episodes. Quality of life was comparable to that of the male German general population except that cognitive functioning and diarrhea were worse in the study population and pain was worse in the reference population. Global quality of life was associated with fecal incontinence, fecal urge, tenesmus, therapy for rectal symptoms and hormonal therapy for biochemical/clinical recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: Rectal symptoms and fecal incontinence after conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer are mostly intermittent. Fecal incontinence, fecal urge and tenesmus are associated with lower global quality of life levels.",Excluded
2439,"Radiosurgical treatment for epilepsy associated with cavernomas Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain, which often present with drug-resistant epilepsy. Microsurgical excision remains the preferred approach for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of Gamma Knife (GK) surgery in the management of drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs in a retrospective multicenter study. Forty-nine patients with cortical or subcortical CMs with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these GK procedures was 7.5 (+/-9.3) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 6.9/month (+/-14). The mean marginal radiation dose was 19.17 Gy. At the last follow-up examination, 53% were seizure free. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for another 20%. The remaining 26% of patients showed little or no improvement. The morbidity was low. Radiosurgery is a promising management modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome. Further prospective work is necessary to validate our data.",Excluded
2043,"Ondansetron and azithromycin: A common combination that can cause QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias Case Reports: Ondansetron is a commonly used antiemetic medication which received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 19911. On September 9, 2011 the FDA announced an ongoing safety review of ondansetron due to suspicion of increasing the risk of abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart2. The FDA received numerous reports of patients taking ondansetron with abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) changes including the potentially fatal cardiac rhythm torsade de pointes2. Ondansetron labeling was updated to warn against prescribing in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. GlaxoSmith Kline, the manufacturer of Zofran, will publish results in the summer of 2012 of an ongoing study investigating the likelihood of ondansetron prolonging the QT interval2. The FDA and manufacturer recommend monitoring electrocardiograms on patients at high risk of arrhythmias1, 2. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has fewer case reports of QT interval prolongation after administration3, 4. Other macrolide antibiotics have been associated with QT interval prolongation but the manufacturer currently does not recommend monitoring electrocardiograms in patients receiving azithromycin1. However in April 2012, a recent study concluded azithromycin had a marginal increase in deaths secondary to cardiovascular causes compared to no antibiotics and treatment with amoxicillin5. In this case, a young female with no known history of structural cardiac disease has a cardiac arrest after receiving multiple doses of ondansetron and azithromycin.A 20 year old female presented to an outside hospital with a one week history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was transferred to our hospital on 9/11/2011 with persistent nausea and elevated liver function tests. She reported resolution of vomiting and diarrhea but felt weak and lethargic and complained of mild bilateral knee pain with no recent trauma. She also complained of sore throat and mild left ear discomfort. Upon presentation on 9/11/2011, she had significant transaminitis with ALT of 2644 U/L, AST of 1647 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 191 U/L. The patient had a total protein of 4.7 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL, TSH of 20.797 uIU/mL, sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 5.8 mmol/L, chloride of 89 mmol/L, and bicarbonate of 19 mmol/L, creatinine of 17.1 mg/dL, and calcium of 6.3 mg/dL. Four milligrams of intravenous ondansetron was administered at an outside emergency room on 9/10/2011 at 22:50. Figure 1 shows rhythm strips prior to the patient experiencing cardiac arrest. She has an extensive past medical history which consists of metastatic thyroid cancer status post thyroidectomy and I-331 radiation, idiopathic end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, community acquired pneumonia, anemia, renal osteodystrophy, hypertension, parathyroidectomy and malnutrition. On 9/11/2011, the patient received four doses of intravenous ondansetron 4 mg at 01:37, 09:21, 15:06, and 23:16. On 9/12/2011, the transaminitis continued with ALT of 2587 U/L, AST of 2121 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 217 U/L, total protein of 4.2 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 6.3 mmol/L, chloride of 88 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, creatinine of 16.7 mg/dL, and calcium of 5.7 mg/dL. The first dose of intravenous azithromycin 500 milligrams was given at 13:28 for possible community acquired pneumonia. At 14:00, the patient had cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation after development of sudden-onset bradycardia and profound hypotension. Cardiac rhythms from this cardiac arrest are included in Figure 2. The patient received CPR, two doses of atropine, two doses of epinephrine, and one dose of calcium chloride with brief return of spontaneous pulses. Patient was intubated, dopamine infusion began, and ventricular fibrillation developed. She was shocked once and given sodium bicarbonate. The cardiac arrest lasted twenty-five minutes and she was transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient did not receive any other oses of ondansetron. Antibiotics were broadened to include: azithromycin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and linezolid. On 9/13/2011, transaminitis persisted with ALT of 1682 U/L, AST of 712 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 185 U/L, total protein of 3.5 g/dL, and total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL. Other abnormal labs included sodium of 131 mmol/L, potassium of 4.8 mmol/L, chloride of 90 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 23 mmol/L, creatinine of 16 mg/dL, and calcium of 6.4 mg/dL (ionized calcium 0.79). Azithromycin 500 milligrams was administered intravenously at 12:09. Within the next hour, the nurse noted the patient to have large and dilated pupils and increased decerebrate posturing. Bradycardia with ventricular tachycardia resulting in pulseless electrical activity was recorded at 13:14. Figure 3 depicts rhythms from this timeframe. The code began at 13:15 with dopamine infusion and boluses of atropine, epinephrine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. She went into ventricular fibrillation and was shocked. The patient had return of spontaneous circulation with sustained ventricular tachycardia after several minutes. Azithromycin was discontinued and electrolytes were corrected. An EKG was taken on 9/13/2011 at 19:09 which showed a corrected QT interval of 499 milliseconds. She did not receive any more doses of ondansetron or azithromycin throughout the admission. CT scan of the head was negative for any acute findings.After the two codes, the patient recovered from anoxic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, and shock liver. Electrolytes were corrected daily if needed to avoid repeat cardiac arrests. After correction of electrolytes and discontinuation of azithromycin, the patient's QT interval remained prolonged. It is noted later that she had a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram from a previous admission (3/9/2011) which showed a corrected QT interval of 538 milliseconds. She received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator during this admission. DiscussionA normal QT interval depends on the balance of sodium and potassium in the heart6. QT prolongation results if cardiac potassium channels are blocked while QRS widening results when sodium channels in the heart are blocked7, 8. HERG is the cardiac potassium channel responsible for the rapid repolarizing current (IKr)7. The QT interval is influenced by the rapid repolarizing current produced by HERG as well as the slow repolarizing current produced by a different cardiac potassium channel KvLQT1 7. Blockage of sodium channels lengthens depolarization and repolarization of the action potential9 which leads to lengthening of the QRS. Patients with prolonged corrected QT intervals greater than 450 milliseconds in men and 460 milliseconds in women are at increased risk of developing arrhythmias6. As the lengthening occurs, the risk of torsade de pointes and ventricular arrythmias increases6.Known risk factors for the lengthening of the QT interval include patients with underlying heart conditions include: 9, 10, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia10,6, concomitant QT-prolonging medications10, 9, bradycardia9, 10, and female gender9. Medications that increase the QT interval include: macrolides (erythromycin and clarithromycin), droperidol, selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, 5-HT antagonists, antipsychotics, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, tacrolimus, voriconazole10, and now more recently brought to the attention by the FDA are 5-HT3 antagonists.This female patient had several comorbidities including: 6, 9 chronic renal failure11, 12,13, hypothyroidism14 and electrolyte abnormalities6, 10, 9 that can lead to prolonged QT interval and ventricular arrythmias. Because of her young age and lack of cardiac history, her previous prolonged QT interval may have been over looked. In addition to her comorbidities, concomitant medications such as ondansetron and azithromycin, which prolong the QT interval, could have resulted in her cardiac arrest. For years droperidol was commonly used for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) but was found to cause significant QT interval prolongation15. Droperidol is believed to cause QT interval prolongation by blocking the HERG potassium (IK) channel9. Droperidol received a black box warning in 2001 for the potential of QT prolongation and induction of arrhythmias9. In order to avoid this risk of QT interval prolongation and other side effects of droperidol, 5-HT3 antagonists became first-line agents for prevention and treatment of PONV15. After increased usage of ondansetron and other 5-HT3 antagonists, more reports of increased QT prolongation have emerged2. Ondansetron has been shown to block sodium channels which widens the QRS and the cardiac HERG potassium (IK) channel which prolongs the QT interval9. The impact of QT prolongation by droperidol and ondansetron has been compared in a nonrandomized fashion. A study of 16 patients determined that both droperidol and ondansetron increase the QT interval alone and in combination with each other16. In a study of 85 patients with PONV, droperidol 0.75 mg intravenously and ondansetron 4 mg intravenously produced similar QT interval prolongation15. No patients received any other QT interval-prolonging medications. Forty-three patients received 0.75 milligrams of droperidol intravenously while forty-two patients received 4 milligrams of ondansetron intravenously when PONV was experienced. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at baseline and then 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after medication administration. Although the study was nonrandomized, the electrocardiograms were analyzed after completion of the study by one blinded investigator.",Excluded
1260,"Pathological circumstances impair the ability of ""dark"" neurons to undergo spontaneous recovery The effects of dehydrating drugs (furosemide, mannitol and glycerine), potassium channel modulators (tetraethylammonium chloride, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid Na salt, minoxidil and pinacidil), sodium channel modulators (veratridine, brevetoxin-9, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride and benzamil-HCl) and mitochondrial enzyme inhibitors (3-nitropropionic acid, 2,4-dinitrophenol and chloramphenicol) on the fate of electrically produced ""dark"" hippocampal dentate granule neurons were investigated. All but one (chloramphenicol) of these bioactive reagents substantially retarded the recovery and increased the death rate of such ""dark"" neurons. As concerns the dehydrating drugs and ion channel modulators, these effects are considered to be consequences of the fact that relatively large volumes (more than half of the original cell volume) of cytoplasmic fluid (water molecules, inorganic ions and metabolites) leave the affected cells through passive pores within a few minutes. The effects of the mitochondrial enzyme inhibitors appear to indicate that restoration of the original cell volume (recovery) demands metabolic (enzyme-mediated) energy. All these features support our previous assumption that the exogenous circumstances existing acutely after the formation of ""dark"" neurons in neurological diseases decide whether they will recover or die.",Excluded

2055,"Similarity pattern analysis in mutational distributions The validity and applicability of the statistical procedure - similarity pattern analysis (SPAN) - to the study of mutational distributions (MDs) was demonstrated with two sets of data. The first was mutational spectra (MS) for 697 GC to AT transitions produced with eight alkylating agents (AAs) in the lacI gene of Escherichia coli. The second was a recently summarized data on the distributions of 11562 spontaneous, radiation- and chemical-induced forward mutations in the ad-3 region of heterokaryon 12 of Neurospora crassa. They were analyzed as large two-way contingency tables (CTs) where two kinds of profiles were compared: site (or genotypic class) profiles and origin (or mutagen) profiles. To measure similarity (homogeneity) between any pair of profiles, the relevant sufficient statistics, Kastenbaum-Hirotsu squared distance (KHi<sup>2</sup>), was used. Collapsing the similar profiles into distinct internally homogeneous clusters named 'collapsets' revealed their similarity pattern. To facilitate the procedure, the computer program, COLLAPSE, was elaborated. The results of SPAN for the lacI spectra were found comparable with the results of their previous analysis with two multivariate statistical methods, the factor and cluster analyses. In the ad-3 data set, five collapsets were revealed among origin profiles (OPs): (I) ENU=4NQO=4HAQO=FANFT=SQ18506; (II) AF-2=EI=MMS=DEP; (III) ETO=UV; (IV) AHA=PROCARB; and (V) He ions=protons. Moreover, the previous observation that MDs are dose-dependent was confirmed for X-ray-induced MDs. Profiles induced with the low doses of X-rays are similar to that induced with <sup>85</sup>Sr, and profiles induced with the medium X-ray doses to those induced with protons and He ions. Evaluated similarities appear to be rather reasonable: mutagens with similar mode of action induce similar MDs. Similarity pattern revealed among genotypic class profiles (GCPs) seems to be also interpretable. When supplemented with descriptive cluster analysis, SPAN appears to be a fruitful methodology in MS analysis. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
825,"Amifostine: an update on its clinical status as a cytoprotectant in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy and its potential therapeutic application in myelodysplastic syndrome UNLABELLED: Amifostine (WR-2721) is a cytoprotective agent that protects a broad range of normal tissues from the toxic effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy without attenuating tumour response. This selective protection is due to the greater conversion and uptake of the active metabolite, WR- 1065, in normal versus neoplastic tissues. In a pivotal phase III trial, 242 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were randomised to receive treatment with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with or without pretreatment with intravenous amifostine 910 mg/m2. Over 6 cycles of therapy, amifostine significantly reduced haematological, renal and neurological toxicities: treatment delays, treatment discontinuation and days in hospital related to these adverse events were also significantly reduced in patients receiving amifostine versus patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In another randomised phase III trial in 303 patients with head and neck cancer undergoing irradiation therapy (total dose 50 to 70Gy), pretreatment with intravenous amifostine 200 mg/m2 significantly reduced the incidence of acute and late grade > or =2 xerostomia. However, mucositis was not significantly reduced in amifostine recipients compared with patients receiving radiotherapy alone, although this has been shown in smaller randomised trials. Amifostine (340 mg/m2) also provided significant protection against pneumonitis and oesophagitis in patients with lung cancer receiving thoracic irradiation in a preliminary report from a phase III trial (n = 144). Other studies have demonstrated protective effects of amifostine in other tumour types and other chemotherapy, radiation and radiochemotherapy regimens; however, evidence is still limited in these indications. No evidence of tumour protection by amifostine has been demonstrated in any clinical trials. Amifostine has also been shown to stimulate haematopoietic stem cells and has been investigated as a therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in number of small preliminary studies. At the recommended dose and schedule, amifostine is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are usually reversible and manageable and those most frequently experienced include nausea and vomiting, transient hypotension and somnolence and sneezing.CONCLUSION: The results of phase III trials have confirmed the safety and efficacy of amifostine as a cytoprotectant to ameliorate cisplatin-induced cumulative renal toxicity, for which it is the only agent proven to be effective, and neutropenia in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, and to reduce xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer receiving irradiation therapy. Depending on the outcome of numerous ongoing clinical trials, amifostine may eventually find broader clinical applications, both as a cytoprotectant and as a potential therapy in myelodysplastic syndrome.

1500,"In vivo imaging of human limbic responses to nitrous oxide inhalation Human behavioral studies have shown that nitrous oxide, in subanesthetic concentrations, impairs psychomotor function, cognitive performance, and learning and memory processes. However, the cerebral mechanisms of such effects remain unknown. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to map the brain areas associated with nitrous oxide effects. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in eight volunteers, during room air (control) or 20% nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide) inhalation using 15(O)-water, to reflect regional neuronal activity. To control for the possibility that 20% nitrous oxide uncoupled cerebral blood flow and metabolism, in four of the subjects, regional cerebral metabolic rate (rCMR) was also measured using 18F-deoxyglucose during the two experimental conditions. Results of rCBF and rCMR scans were compared between conditions using the statistical parametric mapping method, and areas of nitrous oxide-related activation or deactivation were identified at a significance level of 0.005. Percent changes in rCBF scan pixels from these activated or deactivated areas were then compared with those of stereotactically corresponding rCMR scan pixels with t statistics (P < 0.05 was defined as a significant difference). It was found that cerebral blood flow and metabolism were not uncoupled by 20% nitrous oxide, since percent changes in rCBF and rCMR, detected during nitrous oxide inhalation, did not differ significantly from each other (P < 0.05). Nitrous oxide inhalation was associated with significant activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a limbic area known to mediate psychomotor and cognitive processes. Deactivation was found in the posterior cingulate, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and visual association cortices in both hemispheres; the former two regions are known to mediate learning and memory. These areas identified by PET in vivo may provide the neuroanatomical basis for the behavioral responses associated with subanesthetic nitrous oxide inhalation.",Excluded

165,"Does the Gamma Knife dose rate affect outcomes in radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia? OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the radiation dose rate affects clinical outcomes in patients who undergo stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) to manage typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN).METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied pain relief in 165 patients with medically intractable TN, who underwent 80-Gy GKS using a single 4-mm collimator between 1994 and 2005. No patient had received prior radiation treatment. The measured relative helmet output factor of the Gamma Knife was 0.8 throughout this interval, and the dose rate varied from 1.21 Gy/minute to 3.74 Gy/minute (median 2.06 Gy/minute). Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months.RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479).CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute. Cobalt 60 source decay did not affect outcomes of GKS for TN pain management, even for dose rates approximating a 2-half-life decay of the isotope.",Excluded

3183,"Cerenkov luminescence imaging with PET probes for brain function analysis Objectives Optical imaging has advantages in its easy-to-use feature. However, brain imaging is not easy in optical molecular imaging, since the molecular sizes of fluorescent probes are usually too large to penetrate the bloodbrain- barrier. On the other hands, PET imaging is superior in quantitative analysis, and many brain imaging probes are available. Cerenkov radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as a positron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of CLI for the analysis of brain functions using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG, [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Methods For [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG imaging, the mice were separated into two groups. For one group, the hair of the mice were shaved (w/o hair), and for other group, the skull was additionally removed (w/o hair & skull). [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (3 MBq, iv) was injected to each group of the mice, and PET imaging was performed from 30 to 60 min after the injection. Then, Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) was done for 10 min from just after the PET imaging. After in vivo CLI, the brain was removed and ex vivo CLI was performed. Then, the radioactivity of the brain was measured by a gamma-counter. Various fasting times were set for each mouse in order to produce various blood sugar levels. For [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride imaging, the mice (w/o hair) were injected with 7.4 MBq of the tracer, and sequential 8-min CLI (followed by 2-min interval) was performed from 8-10 min after the injection. In vivo blocking study was done by treating the mice with haloperidol. Also, the images were obtained by [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Results In [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG studies, there was a good relationship between the radioactivity and CLI signal in removed brains (r=0.93). The good correlation was observed in w/o hair & skull group (r=0.92). The correlation was weaker in w/o hair group (r=0.74), but it thought to be acceptable for the analysis in mice. The striatum was successfully visualized by [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Luminescence in the striatum was decreased by haloperidol treatment. Since the brain uptake of [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT was higher than [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride, [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT produced more clearer images in CLI. Conclusions Optical imaging was possible with PET imaging probes. Although both quantitativity and sensitivity are inferior to PET imaging, it is possible to use CRI for brain function analysis in mice.",Excluded
2865,"Prox1-positive cells monitor and sustain the murine intestinal epithelial cholinergic niche The enteric neurotransmitter acetylcholine governs important intestinal epithelial secretory and immune functions through its actions on epithelial muscarinic Gq-coupled receptors such as M3R. Its role in the regulation of intestinal stem cell function and differentiation, however, has not been clarified. Here, we find that nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonism in mice as well as epithelial-specific ablation of M3R induces a selective expansion of DCLK1-positive tuft cells, suggesting a model of feedback inhibition. Cholinergic blockade reduces Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cell tracing and cell number. In contrast, Prox1-positive endocrine cells appear as primary sensors of cholinergic blockade inducing the expansion of tuft cells, which adopt an enteroendocrine phenotype and contribute to increased mucosal levels of acetylcholine. This compensatory mechanism is lost with acute irradiation injury, resulting in a paucity of tuft cells and acetylcholine production. Thus, enteroendocrine tuft cells appear essential to maintain epithelial homeostasis following modifications of the cholinergic intestinal niche. Copyright Â© 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

Three glioma, rat C6, and human T98G and U87 cell lines were treated with the NO generating agents, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP). These agents released NO in the cell culture media and inhibited the growth of the glioma cells. Growth-inhibition was attenuated by hemoglobin, a known inhibitor of NO, suggesting it is mediated by NO. When C6 and T98G cells were irradiated in the presence of SNAP or SNP at 100 microM, radiosensitization was observed. SNAP at 100 microM exhibited a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.4 for C6 cells and 1.8 for T98G cells. SNP at 100 microM only radiosensitized T98G cells with a SER of 1.9. The effect of SNP on radiosensitization of C6 cells was unclear. We conclude that NO generating agents are potential growth inhibitors and radiosensitizers for malignant glioma cells. NO mediated radiosensitization of glioma cells by NO generating agents may offer a new therapeutic approach for malignant glioma.",Excluded

1089,"A Comparison of Ramipril and Bevacizumab to Mitigate Radiation-Induced Brain Necrosis: An Experimental Study BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, is a new treatment approach for radionecrosis. In our study, we compared the prophylactic and therapeutic usage of a promising agent, ramipril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), with that of bevacizumab for reducing radiation-induced brain injury after high-dose stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: A total of 60 Wistar rats were used. The rats were irradiated with a single dose of 50 Gy using a Leksell Gamma Knife device. Bevacizumab and ramipril were administered in the prophylactic protocol (starting the first day of SRS) and in the therapeutic protocol (starting the fourth week of SRS). Their usage was continued until 12 weeks, and the right frontal lobes of the rats were examined histologically (hematoxylin and eosin stain) and immunohistochemically (hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF]-1alpha, VEGF, and CD31 antibody expression).RESULTS: The expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and CD31 had significantly increased at 12 weeks after SRS compared with the control group. The addition of bevacizumab or ramipril to SRS significantly mitigated the histological severity of radiation injury and the expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and CD31. However, the prophylactic use of bevacizumab and ramipril seemed to be more effective than therapeutic administration. Our results also revealed that the greatest benefit was achieved with the use of prophylactic administration of bevacizumab compared with other treatment protocols.CONCLUSIONS: Ramipril might be a promising agent for patients with radionecrosis. Clinical studies are required to investigate the effective and safe doses of ramipril, which is an inexpensive, well-tolerated drug that can cross the blood-brain barrier.",Excluded

1392,"Hypothetical role of gravity in Rapid Eye Movements during sleep Dream periods during sleep have been observed in most mammals as early in history as antiquity. Sleep researchers at the University of Chicago, discovered the phase of rapid eye movement (REM) during sleep and connected it to the dream period. During this period, called the REM phase (after the American terminology), although the brain shows electrical activity, it is insensitive to external stimulations, including light, sound, contact and, a little unexpectedly, gravity. However, since this discovery was made there has been no definitive explanation of the rapid eye movements Many possible explanations have been offered, and yet, the causes and contributing factors of the REM sleep phase are inadequately understood. It has often been proposed that the eyes observe the images produced during dreams, but researchers are not convinced. It is proposed here that the movements of the eyes during REM sleep are due to a feeling of disorientation and a subjective loss of landmarks. During the REM sleep phase, the brain has a reduced sensation of gravity, and the sleeper is in a state similar to weightlessness. The instinctive search for the vertical or horizontal direction triggers movements of the eyes, looking for usual points of reference. This hypothesis is reinforced by an original experiment that was conducted in space. The frequency of the eye movements of astronauts during their first night in space is 10 times more than what is experienced on the ground, and that moment in time is when the feeling or the sensation of weightlessness is certainly the most disturbing. Upon the return to Earth, the frequency of the eye movements increases again the first night after landing. These two moments are when the effects of gravity are felt most drastically. The present assumption needs to be validated experimentally and may necessitate further research.",Excluded

Forty-eight patients were treated with 55 implants. The carotid artery was implanted in 15 patients, while seven patients had seeds inserted into the base of the skull region, and another three patients had implants near cranial nerves. Eighteen of the 48 patients were treated for cure. The actuarial survival at five years in this subgroup was 50%. The overall local control in the head and neck area was 58%. In this group no patients to date have had a local failure in the implanted volume. Seventeen patients with comparable stage of disease treated prior to 1974 with curative intent without 125I implants were analyzed retrospectively for comparison with the implanted patients. The actuarial survival of these patients was 18% and the overall head and neck control was 21%. These differences are statistically significant at a P value of 0.01 and 0.007, respectively. Seventeen patients received implants for local recurrence. The local control in the head and neck area was 50%; however, the 2.5 year actuarial survival was only 17%.

2449,"Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the adult rat CNS express myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) While the effects of high dose X-irradiation on mitotically active progenitor cells and remyelination are well-documented, its effects on myelinating oligodendrocytes are less clear, due in part to divergent views on their mitotic capacity. To examine the effect of X-irradiation on oligodendrocytes, the spinal cord of rats was exposed to 40 Gy of X-irradiation and the number of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors in the dorsal funiculi at T12 and L1 was determined by in situ hybridization using cRNA-probes for platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor (PDGFRalpha) (to identify oligodendrocyte progenitors), exon 3b of proteolipid protein (PLP) (to identify mature oligodendrocytes) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). X-irradiation resulted in no change in the number of PLP positive cells and no loss of myelin internodes, but caused an almost complete loss of PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, and a reduction in the number of MOG positive cells to a number similar to that found using the PLP exon 3b probe. Importantly, the number of radiation-sensitive MOG-expressing cells was similar to the number of PDGFRalpha positive cells. To determine if the radiation-sensitive MOG positive cells were the same population as the radiation sensitive PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, MOG and PDGFRalpha-expressing cells were isolated from the adult CNS using antibody coated magnetic beads. Twelve to thirteen percent of MOG positive cells were PDGFRalpha positive and nearly all the PDGFRa isolated cells were MOG and galactocerebroside positive. Double immunofluorescence revealed colocalization of NG2 and MOG on cells in the normal adult rat spinal cord. These results show that in situ in the adult rat spinal cord white matter oligodendrocyte progenitors are MOG positive and indicates that expression of MOG cannot be regarded a marker that only identifies mature myelin-supporting oligodendrocytes in tissue.",Included

Using a previously developed rat model of white matter injury induced by cerebral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, we investigated whether LPS exposure also results in neuronal injury in the neonatal brain and whether alpha-phenyl-n-tert-butyl-nitrone (PBN), an antioxidant, offers protection against LPS-induced neuronal injury. A stereotactic intracerebral injection of LPS (1 mg/kg) was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day 5) and control rats were injected with sterile saline. LPS exposure resulted in axonal and neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex as indicated by elevated expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein, altered axonal length and width, and increased size of cortical neuronal nuclei. LPS exposure also caused loss of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental areas of the rat brain. Treatments with PBN (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced LPS-induced neuronal and axonal damage. The protection of PBN was associated with an attenuation of oxidative stress induced by LPS as indicated by the reduced number of 4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde or nitrotyrosine positive cells in the cortical area following LPS exposure, and with the reduction in microglial activation stimulated by LPS. The finding that an inflammatory environment may cause both white matter and neuronal injury in the neonatal brain supports the possible anatomical correlate for the intellectual deficits and the other cortical and deep gray neuronal dysfunctions associated with PVL. The protection of PBN may indicate the potential usefulness of antioxidants for treatment of these neuronal dysfunctions.",Excluded

To investigate this effect, we have interfered with cell proliferation by locally X-irradiating the fish visual pathway 24h after the lesion. As assayed by immunohistochemistry and EM, irradiation retards until 6 months formation of new myelin by Schwann cells at the lesion site, and virtually abolishes oligodendrocyte myelination distally, but has little or no effect on nerve fibre regrowth. Optic nerve astrocyte processes normally fail to re-infiltrate the lesion, but re-occupy it after irradiation, suggesting that they are normally excluded by early cell proliferation at this site. Moreover, scattered myelinating Schwann cells also appear in the oligodendrocyte-depleted distal optic nerve after irradiation, although only as far as the optic tract. Optic nerve reticular astrocytes differ in various ways from radial glia elsewhere in the fish CNS, and our observations suggest that they may be more permissive to Schwann cell invasion of CNS tissue.",Included
2097,"Surgeon education decreases radiation dose in complex endovascular procedures and improves patient safety OBJECTIVE: Complex endovascular procedures such as fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) are associated with higher radiation doses compared with other fluoroscopically guided interventions (FGIs). The purpose of this study was to determine whether surgeon education on radiation dose control can lead to lower reference air kerma (RAK) and peak skin dose (PSD) levels in high-dose procedures.METHODS: Radiation dose and operating factors were recorded for FGI performed in a hybrid room over a 16-month period. Cases exceeding 6 Gy RAK were investigated according to institutional policy. Information obtained from these investigations led to surgeon education focused on reducing patient dose. Points addressed included increasing table height, utilizing collimation and angulation, decreasing magnification modes, and maintaining minimal patient-to-detector distance. Procedural RAK doses and operating factors were compared 8 months pre- (group A) and 8 months post- (group B) educational intervention using analysis of variance with Tukey pairwise comparisons and t-tests. PSD distributions were calculated using custom software employing input data from fluoroscopic machine logs.RESULTS: Of 447 procedures performed, 300 FGIs had sufficient data to be included in the analysis (54% lower extremity, 11% thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair, 10% cerebral, 8% FEVAR, 7% endovascular aneurysm repair, 5% visceral, and 5% embolization). Twenty-one cases were investigated for exceeding 6 Gy RAK. FEVAR comprised 70% of the investigated cases and had a significantly higher median RAK dose compared with all other FGIs (P < .0001). There was no difference in body mass index between groups A and B; however, increasing body mass index was an indicator for increased RAK. PSD calculations were performed for the 122 procedures that focused on the thorax and abdomen (group A, 80 patients; group B, 42 patients). Surgeon education most strongly affected table height, with an average table height elevation of 10 cm per case after education (P < .0001). The dose index (PSD/RAK ratio) was used to track changes in operating practices, and it decreased from 1.14 to 0.79 after education (P < .0001). These changes resulted in an estimated 16% reduction in PSD. There was a trend toward a decrease in patient to detector distance, and the use of collimation increased from 25% to 40% (P < .001) for all cases; however, these did not result in a decrease in PSD. The number of cases that exceeded 6 Gy RAK did not change after education; however, the proportion of non-FEVAR cases that exceeded 6 Gy decreased from 40% to 20%.CONCLUSIONS: Surgeon education on the appropriate use of technical factors during FGIs improved operating practice, reduced patient radiation dose, and decreased the number of non-FEVAR cases that exceeded 6 Gy. It is essential that vascular surgeons be educated in best operating practices to lower PSD; nonetheless, FEVAR remains a high-dose procedure.",Excluded

174,"Neuronal precursors within the adult rat subventricular zone differentiate into dopaminergic neurons after substantia nigra lesion and chromaffin cell transplant Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain continues in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Neuronal precursors from the SVZ migrate along the rostral migratory stream to replace olfactory bulb interneurons. After the destruction of the nigro-striatal pathway (SN-lesion), some SVZ precursors begin to express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuronal markers (NeuN). Grafting of chromaffin cells (CCs) into the denervated striatum increases the number of TH+ cells (SVZ TH+ cells; Arias-Carrion et al., 2004). This study examines the functional properties of these newly differentiating TH+ cells. Under whole-cell patch-clamp, most SVZ cells recorded from lesioned and grafted animals (either TH+ or TH-) were non-excitable. Nevertheless, a small percentage of SVZ TH+ cells had the electrophysiologic phenotype of mature dopaminergic neurons and showed spontaneous postsynaptic potentials. Dopamine (DA) release was measured in SVZ and striatum from both control and SN-lesioned rats. As expected, 12 weeks after SN lesion, DA release decreased drastically. Nevertheless, 8 weeks after CCs graft, release from the SVZ of SN-lesioned rats recovered, and even surpassed that from control SVZ, suggesting that newly formed SVZ TH+ cells release DA. This study shows for the first time that in response to SN-lesions and CC grafts neural precursors within the SVZ change their developmental program, by not only expressing TH, but more importantly by acquiring excitable properties of mature dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, the release of DA in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and the attraction of synaptic afferents from neighboring neuronal networks gives further significance to the overall findings, whose potential importance is discussed.",Excluded

In the current study, we evaluated neurophysiological and behavioral indices of distractibility across times prior to the night shift (T1), during night hours (T2), and after acute sleep deprivation (T3) in permanent hospital night workers with and without SWD.METHODS: Ten asymptomatic night workers (NW) and 18 NW with SWD participated in a 25-h sleep deprivation study. Circadian phase was evaluated by dim-light salivary melatonin onset (DLMO). Objective sleepiness was evaluated using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Electrophysiological distractibility was evaluated by brain event-related potentials (ERP), whereas behavioral distractibility was evaluated by performance on a visual task in an auditory-visual distraction paradigm.STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Comparisons of ERP results were performed by repeated-measures analysis of variance, and t-tests were used where appropriate. A Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of variables (MLST, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and DLMO) that deviated from normal.RESULTS: First, in the SWD group, the reorienting negativity ERP amplitude was significantly attenuated compared to that in the NW group. Second, the SWD group had shorter MSLT during night shift hours (4.8 +/- 4.9 min) compared to that in NW (7.8 +/- 3.7 min; U = 47; z = -2.1; P < 0.03). Third, NW with SWD had a DLMO at 20:27 +/- 5.0 h, whereas healthy NW had a DLMO at 05:00 +/- 3.4 h (U = 43.5; z = -2.22, P < 0.03). Finally, acute sleep deprivation impaired behavioral performance and the P3a ERP in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate specific deficits in neurophysiological activity in the attentional domain among the shift-work disorder group relative to night workers.",Excluded

Adaptation to these daily and seasonal changes in light properties (and associated changes in the environment) is important to the sustained survival of higher life forms on our planet. Many organisms use their intrinsic circadian oscillator or clock to orchestrate daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology to adapt to diurnal changes. Some higher organisms use the same oscillator to monitor day length in selecting the appropriate season for reproductive behaviour. Organisms have developed irradiance measurement mechanisms to ignore photic noise (lightning, moonlight), and use the light of dusk and dawn for circadian photoentrainment. They have also devised multiple photoreceptors and signalling cascades to buffer against changes in the spectral composition of natural light. The interaction of the clock with ambient light is, therefore, quite intricate. [References: 31]",Excluded
3579,"The role of PET in target localization for radiotherapy treatment planning Positron emission tomography (PET) is currently accepted as an important tool in oncology, mostly for diagnosis, staging and restaging purposes. It provides a new type of information in radiotherapy, functional rather than anatomical. PET imaging can also be used for target volume definition in radiotherapy treatment planning. The need for very precise target volume delineation has arisen with the increasing use of sophisticated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy techniques and intensity modulated radiation therapy. It is expected that better delineation of the target volume may lead to a significant reduction in the irradiated volume, thus lowering the risk of treatment complications (smaller safety margins). Better tumour visualisation also allows a higher dose of radiation to be applied to the tumour, which may lead to better tumour control. The aim of this article is to review the possible use of PET imaging in the radiotherapy of various cancers. We focus mainly on non-small cell lung cancer, lymphoma and oesophageal cancer, but also include current opinion on the use of PET-based planning in other tumours including brain, uterine cervix, rectum and prostate.

999,"Correction of prototypic ATM splicing mutations and aberrant ATM function with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides We used antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMOs) to redirect and restore normal splicing of three prototypic splicing mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. Two of the mutations activated cryptic 5' or 3' splice sites within exonic regions; the third mutation activated a downstream 5' splice site leading to pseudoexon inclusion of a portion of intron 28. AMOs were targeted to aberrant splice sites created by the mutations; this effectively restored normal ATM splicing at the mRNA level and led to the translation of full-length, functional ATM protein for at least 84 h in the three cell lines examined, as demonstrated by immunoblotting, ionizing irradiation-induced autophosphorylation of ATM, and transactivation of ATM substrates. Ionizing irradiation-induced cytotoxicity was markedly abrogated after AMO exposure. The ex vivo data strongly suggest that the disease-causing molecular pathogenesis of such prototypic mutations is not the amino acid change of the protein but the mutated DNA code itself, which alters splicing. Such prototypic splicing mutations may be correctable in vivo by systemic administration of AMOs and may provide an approach to customized, mutation-based treatment for ataxia-telangiectasia and other genetic disorders.",Excluded
522,"A novel high-resolution in vivo imaging technique to study the dynamic response of intracranial structures to tumor growth and therapeutics We have successfully integrated previously established Intracranial window (ICW) technology (1-4) with intravital 2-photon confocal microscopy to develop a novel platform that allows for direct long-term visualization of tissue structure changes intracranially. Imaging at a single cell resolution in a real-time fashion provides supplementary dynamic information beyond that provided by standard end-point histological analysis, which looks solely at 'snap-shot' cross sections of tissue. Establishing this intravital imaging technique in fluorescent chimeric mice, we are able to image four fluorescent channels simultaneously. By incorporating fluorescently labeled cells, such as GFP+ bone marrow, it is possible to track the fate of these cells studying their long-term migration, integration and differentiation within tissue. Further integration of a secondary reporter cell, such as an mCherry glioma tumor line, allows for characterization of cell:cell interactions. Structural changes in the tissue microenvironment can be highlighted through the addition of intra-vital dyes and antibodies, for example CD31 tagged antibodies and Dextran molecules. Moreover, we describe the combination of our ICW imaging model with a small animal micro-irradiator that provides stereotactic irradiation, creating a platform through which the dynamic tissue changes that occur following the administration of ionizing irradiation can be assessed. Current limitations of our model include penetrance of the microscope, which is limited to a depth of up to 900 mum from the sub cortical surface, limiting imaging to the dorsal axis of the brain. The presence of the skull bone makes the ICW a more challenging technical procedure, compared to the more established and utilized chamber models currently used to study mammary tissue and fat pads (5-7).

In this study we assessed the spontaneous locomotors activity (SLA) of the mice after the acute exposure to mobile phones. 10 30-day-old mice (average weight 30gm) were grouped as control and EMR and they were habitualised for one week prior to start the experiment in well designed circular cell phone exposure (CCPE) cage. CCPE cage was specially designed for EMR exposure through the cellular phone over the mice in the natural environment and it was placed inside the exposure room where other electric appliances did not exist. In the cage, cellular phone was placed in the center and mice were allowed to move around the device within 10cm radius. After a 5 hours/day exposure to mobile phone non-ionizing radiation to mice, locomotor activity was measured using computerized optovarimax animal activity monitor. In this study no significant changes were found in distance travelled, time resting, time moving and stereotypic time to the EMR exposed group than controls.

3570,"Impact of cellular localization of survivin on the resistance of glioblastoma cells againstthe monoalkylating anticancer drugs Question: Despite constant progress in medical care, brain tumors WHO grade IV (Glioblastoma multiforme) remain incurable. In the last decade, survivin, an inhibitor of the apoptosis proteins (IAP) family, was shown to be a promising target, as it is selectively expressed in tumors and its expression correlates with the grade of malignancy and therapy response. Besides being an anti-apoptotic factor, survivin plays a role during chromosome segregation in mitosis. It passively penetrates into the nucleus but is actively exported out of the nucleus through its C-terminal nuclear export sequence (NES). Since nuclear accumulation of survivin was observed upon exposure to ionizing radiation, where survivin seems to support DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, the question arises whether also alkylation-induced DSBs impact survivin localization and how this affects DNA repair, cell cycle, clastogenicity and cellular survival. Method(s): DNA cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, transfection and generation of stable clones, immunofluorescence, colony-forming assays, flow cytometric cell death assays, western blot analysis, Co-IP/ interactome analysis, chromosomal aberration assays. Result(s): To answer the questions, we generated glioblastoma cell clones stably expressing either a GFP-survivin or a NES-mutated GFP-survivin fusion protein (GFPNESmut-survivin). In colony-forming assays, we observed that cell clones with strong GFP-survivin expression were mostly protected against temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line monoalkylating drug, whereas clones expressing GFP-NESmut-survivin were most sensitive. We also observed that GFP-survivin was efficiently exported out of the nucleus, whereas the mutated GFP-survivin retained in the nucleus and even accumulated during the time course of TMZ exposure. Neither of GFP-survivin variants co-localized with yH2AXfoci, but interestingly, cells expressing GFP-NESmut-survivin showed significantly more TMZ-induced yH2AX foci as compared to GFP-survivin expressing cells. This correlates with the observed overall survival after exposure to the drug. Coimmunoprecipitation in nuclear extracts of TMZ-exposed cells using survivin as bait revealed its potential specific interactors. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data show that only survivin localized in the nucleus renders glioblastoma cells hypersensitive to TMZ, which stresses nuclear survivin to be a beneficial prognostic marker and supports the use of nuclear export inhibitors as adjuvant drugs.",Excluded
27,"A 4-year retrospective review of our experience developing a successful non-vascular thoracic MR practice Purpose: For some time, subspecialists in neurologic, musculoskeletal, GI/GU, cardiac, and breast imaging have harnessed the well-known superior tissue characterization of MRI to improve diagnosis and patient care. By contrast, many thoracic imaging specialists may be underutilizing thoracic MRI. Recognizing the potential value of thoracic MRI to patient care, we set out to increase its utilization. Material(s) and Method(s): In late 2008 we began updating our nonvascular thoracic MR protocols, incorporating a combination of body and cardiac MRtechniques, creating a more high quality, interpretable examination by consultation with MR applications specialists and cardiac MR technologists and by imaging of volunteers. We reviewed MR protocol principles with our thoracic imaging division and began to show current MR cases regularly at our weekly thoracic imaging case conference. We educated our technologists with in-service presentations and hands-onMR imaging of volunteers to familiarize them with issues and challenges particular to thoracicMRimaging.We have trained our thoracic imaging fellows to protocol, monitor, and interpret these studies and have been educating our referring physicians about MR's value in increasing diagnostic specificity, guiding surgical approach, and preventing unnecessary interventional procedures without radiation exposure. We also retrospectively reviewed thoracic MR utilization from 2009 through 2012. Result(s): Our thoracic MR volume increased from 18 cases in 2009 to 88 cases in 2012 totalling 219 examinations over this period-182 mediastinal, 28 full chest, 5 focused pleural, 2 superior sulcus, and 2 combined neck/upper chest (these numbers exclude brachial plexus MRIs interpreted by our Musculoskeletal Imaging division). Indications included further characterization of thymic, other mediastinal, and pleural lesions, follow-up of thoracic lymphadenopathy, and assessment of chest wall/vascular invasion by lung cancer and mesothelioma. Internists requested 130/219 studies (59%) and surgeons requested 89/219 (41%), with many repeat referrals indicative of a new recognition of thoracic MR's value. Conclusion(s): With continuous updating of thoracic MR protocols, ongoing education of MR technologists and physicians, and incorporation of MR training into thoracic MR fellowship programs, the full contribution of thoracic MR to clinical practice can be realized. Clinical Implication: Improving thoracic MR protocols and educating technologists and physicians promote increased thoracic MR utilization and may improve patient care.",Excluded
2340,"Gamma knife treatment for symptomatic epilepsy due to vascular malformations Introduction: Detailed prospective studies are scarce on gamma knife treatment for arteriovenous malformations (AVM) or cavernous angioma (CA) regarding epilepsy outcome. The objective of this study is to further investigate prospectively the effect of gamma knife on seizures and expand our knowledge to other aspects of epilepsy management: medication, cognition and quality of life. Method(s): We included prospectively 9 consecutive patients (4 AVM and 5 CA) who underwent radiosurgery for epilepsy caused by vascular malformation at the CHUS between August 2004 and August 2009. The mean marginal radiation dose was 20 Gy. The objective of this study is to determinate the seizure outcome after radiosurgery. Patients were followed every 3 months to evaluate seizure count over time, Engel score and medication status. Quality of life (QOLIE 89) and neuropsychological evaluation were completed before the treatment and at 12 and 24 months following the intervention. Result(s): Patients were followed for a mean period of 39 months (range from 15 to 72 months). Three patients have been seizure free for 1 year (33%). Overall 5 patients (55%) had significant improvement with an Engel score of 1 (completely seizure free or non disabling simple partial seizure only). Medication status did not change over time. The QOLIE 89 score improved by more than 25 points (on a 100 points scale) in 3 patients (43%), 2 patients (29%) reported no change and 2 patients had lower scores. Neuropsychological testing did not show any deterioration in cognition following the intervention. No adverse reaction occurred so far. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery has some efficacy for the treatment of epilepsy associated with vascular malformations and improves quality of life in a majority of patients. It seems less effective than surgical lesionectomy. No cognitive or physical morbidity was observed. This treatment could be a useful alternative for vascular lesions in eloquent areas that cannot be safely removed with microsurgery.",Excluded

2859,"Long thoracic and spinal accessory nerve injury after an esophagectomy: A unusual case report of scapular winging Patients or Programs: A 54-year-old right-handed man with a history of esophageal cancer treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and esophagectomy. Program Description: The patient was referred to the clinic by his oncologist for evaluation of bilateral shoulder pain. He had recently undergone esophagectomy with right thoracotomy. Before surgery, the patient had no shoulder pain; after surgery, he developed severe pain and restricted range of motion in the bilateral shoulders, worse on the right side. He had difficulty with overhead reaching and use of his right upper limb in activities of daily living. On examination, he was noted to have significant winging of the right scapula along the medial border when at rest and with a wall pushup, an inability to forward flex the right shoulder past 80degree and abduct past 70degree, atrophy of the right posterior shoulder girdle, and a large well-healed scar along the right lateral scapular border. Setting(s): Outpatient musculoskeletal clinic. Result(s): An electromyography and nerve conduction study was performed and revealed both long thoracic and spinal accessory neuropathy. Subsequent ultrasound imaging of the shoulder revealed a neuroma deep to the scar in the right mid axillary line, suspicious for a laceration of the long thoracic nerve. The patient was referred to the orthotics department to be fitted for a scapulothoracic orthosis. Discussion(s): Although rare, scapular winging can present after surgery due to traumatic, iatrogenic, or idiopathic factors. Prior studies have shown that postoperative scapular winging can have a neurogenic etiology, with isolated injury to the long thoracic, spinal accessory, or dorsal scapular nerve. In this unusual case, the patient developed injury to a combination of nerves, which led his symptoms. Conclusion(s): Postoperative scapular winging can be associated with concomitant long thoracic and spinal accessory nerve injury.",Excluded

Switching to a femoral approach was considered to be a safer alternative for percutaneous intervention due to the presence of arteria lusoria. Risks and possible complications would include increased contrast use, increased radiation exposure, aortic dissection and even cerebral stroke, all of which have been reported extensively in literature.

3069,"Endovascular treatment using low-power ultraviolet laser for delayed vasospasm in the rabbit carotid artery model BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We previously reported that pretreatment with external ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at 325 nm before blood exposure prevented the development of chronic vasospasm in rabbit common carotid arteries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the preventive effect of endovascular UV light on vasospasm after blood immersion by using the same animal model.METHODS: The right common carotid arteries in 63 rabbits were enclosed in silicon cuffs on day 0. Sheaths were empty or filled with clotted blood. Thirty minutes after the placement of the sheaths, either alone or with blood, the common carotid arteries were subjected to UV or visible light (442 nm) irradiation via an endovascular approach at a fluence rate of 0.17 W/cm(2). The animals were killed on day 2, 9, or 30. Digital subtraction angiography was performed on days 0 and 2 and at the end point to evaluate the degree of vasospasm.RESULTS: UV treatment significantly prevented the development of vasospasm on day 2. On days 9 and 30, there were no significant differences between UV-treated animals and control animals. The preventive effect reached an approximate plateau with an irradiation time of 10 s. No severe vascular injury, such as perforation, occurred in response to UV treatment during the observation period. UV light was significantly more effective than visible light in preventing vasospasm (P <.001).CONCLUSION: These results suggest that endovascular UV irradiation after blood exposure has a prophylactic effect on vasospasm and suggest a dependence on irradiation wavelength and duration of irradiation.",Excluded
465,"Evidence that peripheral rather than intracranial thermal signals induce thermoregulation Numerous effector mechanisms have been discovered, which change body temperature and thus serve to maintain the thermal integrity of homeothermic animals. These mechanisms are driven by thermal signals that are processed by neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area. To keep a tight control over body temperature, these neurons have to receive accurate thermal information. Although in vitro studies have shown the direct thermosensitive ability of neurons in the preoptic area, other observations suggest the existence of peripheral thermosensation and an ascending thermal pathway to the thermoregulatory center. Direct evidences for either one, or both are still missing. In the present study, brain, rectal, subcutaneous and skin surface temperatures were measured during 15, 30, 60 and 120 min of cold exposure (4 degrees C) in rats and compared with neuronal activation due to cold stress shown by c-fos in situ hybridization histochemistry. Subcutaneous and skin surface temperatures dropped continuously throughout the 120 min of cold exposure by 1.4 degrees C and 6.5 degrees C, respectively. However, during the first 30 min, brain and rectal temperatures increased by 0.3 degrees C and 0.25 degrees C, respectively, and even after 60 min of cold stress, brain temperature did not decrease under the level measured at 0 min. Since the brain temperature did not decrease, it is unlikely that intracranial thermoreceptors are involved in the transmission of ""cold"" thermal signal to induce thermoregulation. At 30 min of cold exposure, neurons in all known thermoregulatory areas (like the ventrolateral part of the medial preoptic nucleus, the lateral retrochiasmatic area, the lateral parabrachial nucleus and the peritrigeminal nucleus) were already maximally activated. These observations clearly indicate that the activation of neurons in the preoptic and several other thermoregulatory nuclei is induced in vivo by thermal signals originating in the periphery, and not in the CNS.",Excluded

Many agents have been used for neuroprotection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible protective role of royal jelly on radiationinduced brain damage. Design(s): In the present study, thirty-two adult male Dawley rats, 8-12 weeks of age and weighing 275+/-35 grams were randomly divided into four groups each group compressed eight animals: group 1: control (C), group 2: irradiated rats (RT), group 3: irradiated rats with oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 days (RT+RJ50), group 4: oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 day (RJ50). Sprague Dawley rats were irradiated with 22 Gy gamma radiation delivered to total cranium. Royal jelly was administered before and after irradiation per day for 7 days. At the seventh day of study, when rats were under ketamine anesthesia samples of brain tissues were taken and biochemical and microscopic examination after sacrification. Result(s): An increase in brain tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations (P<0.001) were detected while significant decreases in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities (P<0.001) in irradiation alone group when compared to control group. Increases in MDA were relatively well prevented by royal jelly. The administration of RJ increased to activity of SOD and CAT enzymes and decreased MDA level in the brain tissue (p<0.001). On histopathological examination, royal jelly reduced edema, necrosis, vasodilation and neuronal degeneration. Conclusion(s): The results obtained from this study demonstrated that with royal jelly prevented the damage that develops in brain following irradiation. The beneficial effect of royal jelly can be related to protection of the brain from oxidative injury.",Included
2415,"Potential Improvements in Brain Dose Estimates For Internal Emitters BACKGROUND: Element-specific biokinetic models are used to reconstruct doses to systemic tissues from internal emitters. Typically, a systemic model for a radionuclide explicitly depicts only its dominant repositories. Remaining tissues and fluids are aggregated into a pool called Other tissue in which the radionuclide is assumed to be uniformly distributed. In the systemic biokinetic models used in radiation protection, the brain usually is addressed as an implicit mass fraction of Other tissue rather than an explicitly depicted repository. Due to increasing interest in radiation effects on the brain, efforts are underway to improve brain dosimetry for internal radiation sources.METHODS: We assessed potential improvements in brain dosimetry for internal emitters by explicitly modelling brain kinetics rather than treating the brain as a mass fraction of Other tissue. We selected ten elements for which brain kinetics can be modeled using published biokinetic data. Injection dose coefficients were calculated for a relatively long-lived radioisotope of each element using each of two versions of the ICRP's latest systemic biokinetic model for each element, the original version and a modified version differing only in the treatment of brain. If the ICRP model contained an explicit brain pool, the modified version depicted brain instead as a mass fraction of Other tissue. If the ICRP model included brain in Other tissue, the modified version included an explicit brain pool with kinetics based on best available brain-specific data.RESULTS: The result for a given radionuclide is expressed as a ratio A:B, where A and B are the dose coefficients based on the versions of the model with and without an explicit brain pool, respectively. The following ratios A:B were obtained for the 10 radionuclides addressed here: 241Am, 0.13; 207Bi, 0.57; 234U, 0.81; 239Pu, 0.96; 203Hg (vapor), 1.4; 134Cs, 1.5; 54Mn, 1.7; 210Po, 1.7; 226Ra, 1.9; 210Pb, 3.3. These ratios indicate that a dose estimate for brain based on a biokinetic model with brain implicitly contained in Other tissue may substantially underestimate or substantially overestimate a dose estimate that reflects best available brain-specific biokinetic data. Of course, the reliability of the latter estimate depends on the quality of the underlying biokinetic data.CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, the brain should be depicted explicitly in biokinetic models used in epidemiological studies addressing adverse effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded

318,"Plasma membrane nanoporation as a possible mechanism behind infrared excitation of cells OBJECTIVE: Short infrared (IR) laser pulses have been used to stimulate action potentials in neurons both in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon has remained elusive. In vitro studies have found that pulsed IR exposure generates a nearly instant change in capacitance in the plasma membrane, characterized by inward rectification, a common feature in pore-forming exposures, such as electrical pulses and acoustic shock waves. Based on this similarity, we hypothesize that the mechanism of IR stimulation is the formation of short-lived nanopores in the plasma membrane. These transient, small-diameter pores allow the influx of extracellular ions that lead to action potential generation, possibly through activation of secondary messenger pathways or depolarization of the cell membrane resulting in activation of voltage-gated ion channels.APPROACH: A variety of fluorescent markers are used to observe the cell response to IR stimulation to monitor for effects indicative of nanoporation in other modalities.MAIN RESULTS: We observe rapid, transient rises in intracellular Ca(2+), influx of YO-PRO-1 and propidium iodide into the cell signifying membrane permeabilization, cellular blebbing and swelling, and activation of the intracellular phosphoinositides lipid signaling pathway.SIGNIFICANCE: This conclusion better explains the experimental observations and limitations of IR-induced neurological stimulation and represents a distinct theoretical shift in the understanding of the mechanism of IR-induced stimulation.",Excluded

PMS is associated with paresthesias and pain in the hips, buttocks and lower part of body, while ultrasound-guided piriformis injections has several advantages compared prevalent and common approaches, such as well-set shape, availability, direct imaging of neurovascular structures and lack of exposing to ionizing radiation Methods: Fifteen patients (5 male and 10 female; average age, 55.6 years; range, 21-75 years) were diagnosed with PMS based on clinical history, electromyography, straight leg raising (SLR) and Pace signs. First the injection of Methyl Prednisone was applied under guidance of a Micromaxx ultrasound machine and using a 5-10 MHz, 38-mm broadband linear probe. For piriformis injection under ultrasonographic guidance, a linear ultrasound probe is positioned with its lateral side medial to the greater trochanter and its medial side lateral to the ischial tuberosity. The sciatic nerve is then followed cephalad until it courses beneath the piriformis. Ultrasound probe is directed parallel to piriformis. Needle is inserted in lateral third of piriformis. The therapeutic effect was assessed before and a month after injection via Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as three groups: improvement, partial improvement, or failure depending on the degree of symptom Results: According to the results, 7 patients (46.6%) showed improvement, 4 (26.6%) showed partial improvement and 4 (26.6%) failed to respond to the initial treatment.

1458,"Fractionated radiosurgery for painful spinal metastases: DOSIS - a phase II trial BACKGROUND: One third of all cancer patients will develop bone metastases and the vertebral column is involved in approximately 70% of these patients. Conventional radiotherapy with of 1-10 fractions and total doses of 8-30 Gy is the current standard for painful vertebral metastases; however, the median pain response is short with 3-6 months and local tumor control is limited with these rather low irradiation doses. Recent advances in radiotherapy technology - intensity modulated radiotherapy for generation of highly conformal dose distributions and image-guidance for precise treatment delivery - have made dose-escalated radiosurgery of spinal metastases possible and early results of pain and local tumor control are promising. The current study will investigate efficacy and safety of radiosurgery for painful vertebral metastases and three characteristics will distinguish this study. 1) A prognostic score for overall survival will be used for selection of patients with longer life expectancy to allow for analysis of long-term efficacy and safety. 2) Fractionated radiosurgery will be performed with the number of treatment fractions adjusted to either good (10 fractions) or intermediate (5 fractions) life expectancy. Fractionation will allow inclusion of tumors immediately abutting the spinal cord due to higher biological effective doses at the tumor - spinal cord interface compared to single fraction treatment. 3) Dose intensification will be performed in the involved parts of the vertebrae only, while uninvolved parts are treated with conventional doses using the simultaneous integrated boost concept.METHODS / DESIGN: It is the study hypothesis that hypo-fractionated image-guided radiosurgery significantly improves pain relief compared to historic data of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Primary endpoint is pain response 3 months after radiosurgery, which is defined as pain reduction of >= 2 points at the treated vertebral site on the 0 to 10 Visual Analogue Scale. 60 patients will be included into this two-centre phase II trial.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study will refine the methods of patient selection, target volume definition, treatment planning and delivery as well as quality assurance for radiosurgery.

Here we describe clinically relevant analyses for D + EP vs EP based on PD-L1 expression, progression patterns and PROs. Method(s): Tx-naive ES-SCLC (WHO PS 0/1) pts received 4 cycles of EP plus D q3w followed by maintenance D q4w or up to 6 cycles of EP q3w + prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI; investigator's discretion). PD-L1 expression in optional archival tissue was tested by VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) immunohistochemistry assay. PROs were assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30/LC13 with changes from baseline analysed by time to deterioration (TTD) per Cox proportional hazards. Result(s): As of 11 March 2019, 265 and 266 pts had received D + EP and EP, respectively. Of 277 with evaluable samples (D + EP, 151; EP, 126), PD-L1 expression was low (5% and 22% of pts with expression >=1% in tumour (TC) and immune cells (IC), respectively). Evaluating PD-L1 expression as a continuous variable in either TC or IC indicated no significant impact of PD-L1 on Tx effect between arms for OS (P = 0.54 and 0.23, respectively); nor for PFS and ORR. Progression patterns were similar, although fewer pts developed new lesions at first progression with D + EP vs EP (41.4% vs 47.2%), including lung lesions (8.6% vs 15.2%). The incidence of new brain/CNS metastases was similar between arms (11.6% vs 11.5%), despite PCI allowance in the control arm only. Baseline PRO scores were comparable across all symptoms and functional domains. TTD was longer across all PROs for D + EP (favourable HRs, many with upper 95% CIs <1; Table 1). [Table presented] Conclusion(s): D + EP provided significant OS benefit over EP alone, while preserving QoL and increasing the time to worsening of symptoms and functioning.

A secondary aim was to investigate the relationship between acoustic and perceptual measures.METHODS: In total, 37 patients received voice rehabilitation post-radiotherapy and 37 patients constituted the irradiated control group. Outcome measures were mean CPPS for connected speech and ratings with the auditory-perceptual Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia and Strain (GRBAS) scale. Outcome measures were analyzed 1 (baseline), 6, 12, and 24 months post-radiotherapy, where voice rehabilitation was conducted between the first two time-points. Additional recordings were acquired from vocally healthy participants for comparison.RESULTS: CPPS values of the voice rehabilitation group and vocally healthy group were not significantly different at 24 months post-radiotherapy. Ten out of 19 patients who received voice rehabilitation yielded a CPPS value above the threshold for normal voice 24 months post-radiotherapy, compared to 11 out of 26 in the irradiated control group. No statistically significant correlations were found between CPPS and perceptual parameters of GRBAS.CONCLUSION: Voice rehabilitation for irradiated laryngeal cancer patients may have positive effects on voice quality up to 24 months post-radiotherapy. The relationship between CPPS and GRBAS as well as the applicability of CPPS for evaluation over several points of measurement needs to be studied further.",Excluded
2884,"Radiation Induces Distinct Changes in Defined Subpopulations of Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells in the Adult Hippocampus While irradiation can effectively treat brain tumors, this therapy also causes cognitive impairments, some of which may stem from the disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis. To study how radiation affects neurogenesis, we combine phenotyping of subpopulations of hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells with double- and triple S-phase labeling paradigms. Using this approach, we reveal new features of division, survival, and differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells after exposure to gamma radiation. We show that dividing neural stem cells, while susceptible to damage induced by gamma rays, are less vulnerable than their rapidly amplifying progeny. We also show that dividing stem and progenitor cells that survive irradiation are suppressed in their ability to replicate 0.5-1 day after the radiation exposure. Suppression of division is also observed for cells that entered the cell cycle after irradiation or were not in the S phase at the time of exposure. Determining the longer term effects of irradiation, we found that 2 months after exposure, radiation-induced suppression of division is partially relieved for both stem and progenitor cells, without evidence for compensatory symmetric divisions as a means to restore the normal level of neurogenesis. By that time, most mature young neurons, born 2-4 weeks after the irradiation, still bear the consequences of radiation exposure, unlike younger neurons undergoing early stages of differentiation without overt signs of deficient maturation. Later, 6 months after an exposure to 5 Gy, cell proliferation and neurogenesis are further impaired, though neural stem cells are still available in the niche, and their pool is preserved. Our results indicate that various subpopulations of stem and progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus have different susceptibility to gamma radiation, and that neurogenesis, even after a temporary restoration, is impaired in the long term after exposure to gamma rays. Our study provides a framework for investigating critical issues of neural stem cell maintenance, aging, interaction with their microenvironment, and post-irradiation therapy.",Included

1467,"Circadian and photic regulation of immediate-early gene expression in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus is the site of an endogenous circadian clock synchronized by daily light-dark cycles. At some daily phases, light exposure both shifts the clock and alters the expression of several immediate-early genes in cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We have studied both spontaneous circadian and light-induced expression of several immediate-early gene messenger RNAs and proteins in hamsters in constant darkness or in response to brief light exposure. There was no detectable spontaneous expression of NGFI-A messenger RNA in suprachiasmatic nucleus cells at any circadian phase, but light pulses induced its expression selectively during the subjective night, with highest levels of expression 6 h into the night. We also found that there are two independent rhythms of expression of junB messenger RNA and JunB protein, as well as c-fos messenger RNA and c-Fos protein, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of hamsters: a rhythm of photic sensitivity expressed throughout the night and a spontaneous rhythm of expression triggered around dawn. Induction of NGFI-A messenger RNA and c-fos messenger RNA and c-Fos protein in response to a light pulse were found throughout the suprachiasmatic nucleus, with the highest levels of expression in the ventrolateral subdivision; however, the spontaneous expression of JunB and c-Fos proteins was confined mainly to the dorsomedial suprachiasmatic nucleus. The temporal and anatomical differences in the expression of these immediate-early genes in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus suggest that their protein products may be involved in different signaling mechanisms mediating either photic entrainment or endogenous oscillations within distinct subpopulations of suprachiasmatic nucleus cells.",Excluded

The mice were irradiated at 100 days of age and euthanatized about 500 days (16 months) later. Exposures were: 60Co gamma photons (LETinfinity = 1-2 keV/micrometer), 4He (LETinfinity = 6 keV/micrometer), 12C (LETinfinity = 80 keV/micrometer), 20Ne (LETinfinity = 150 keV/micrometer), 56Fe (LETinfinity = 180 keV/micrometer), and 40Ar (LETinfinity = 650 keV/micrometer). Animals receiving particle radiation were exposed in an extended Bragg peak region except for iron where the plateau region was used. The zones measured in the olfactory bulb were 1) the external plexiform layer (zone) and 2) an internal region consisting of the granule cells, internal plexiform layer, and layer of mitral cells. These studies indicated that volume changes did indeed occur, not only in absolute terms but also when expressed as the ratio of the structures to each other and to the bulb as a whole. Although this study is exploratory in character, the data obtained may nevertheless contribute to a determination of risk factors due to late effects from HZE articles.",Included

MDA levels were increased in all studied samples, except lung; the highest increases were observed in the most radiosensitive organs (bone marrow, thymus, spleen) and not in those continuously exposed to high concentrations of molecular oxygen (lungs, erythrocytes).

Low-dose (high-dose-rate) X-irradiation inhibits FSTinduced immobility in mice due to its antioxidative function. We evaluated the effects of low-dose gamma-irradiation at a low-dose-rate on the FST-induced depletion of antioxidants in mouse organs. Mice received whole-body low-dose-rate (0.6 or 3.0 mGy/h) of low-dose gamma-irradiation for 1 week, followed by daily FSTs (5 days). The immobility rate on day 2 compared to day 1 was significantly lower in the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice than in sham irradiated mice. The FST significantly decreased the catalase (CAT) activity and total glutathione (t-GSH) content in the brain and kidney, respectively. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and t-GSH content in the liver of the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice were significantly lower than those of the non-FST-treated mice. The CAT activity in the lungs of mice exposed to 3.0 mGy/h gamma-irradiation was higher than that of non-FST treated mice and mice treated with FST. However, no significant differences were observed in the levels of these antioxidant markers between the sham and irradiated groups except for the CAT activity in lungs. These findings suggest that the effects of low-dose-rate and low-dose gamma-irradiation on FST are highly organ-dependent.",Included

Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Included

The mechanisms underlying impairments in cognition are not clear but might involve alterations in the percentage of neurons in the dentate gyrus expressing the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc. Previously, we showed effects of cranial <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation on hippocampus-dependent contextual freezing and on the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed, but not free, blade. Because it is unclear whether whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation causes similar effects on these markers of hippocampal function, in the present study we quantified the effects of whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation (600MeV, 0.5 or 1Gy) on hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent cognitive performance and determined whether these effects were associated with changes in Arc expression in the enclosed and free blades of the dentate gyrus. Whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation impacted contextual but not cued fear freezing and the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In mice tested for contextual freezing, there was a correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In addition, in mice irradiated with 0.5Gy, contextual freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed blade. In mice tested for cued freezing, there was no correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In contrast, cued freezing in the presence or absence of aversive stimuli correlated with Arc-positive cells in the free blade. In addition, in mice irradiated with 1Gy cued freezing in the absence of aversive stimuli correlated with the percentage of Arc-positive neurons in the free blade. These data indicate that while whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe radiation affects contextual freezing and Arc-positive cells in the dentate gyrus, the enclosed blade might be more important for contextual freezing while the free blade might be more important for cued freezing.

756,"Progressive reduction of its expression in rods reveals two pools of arrestin-1 in the outer segment with different roles in photoresponse recovery Light-induced rhodopsin signaling is turned off with sub-second kinetics by rhodopsin phosphorylation followed by arrestin-1 binding. To test the availability of the arrestin-1 pool in dark-adapted outer segment (OS) for rhodopsin shutoff, we measured photoresponse recovery rates of mice with arrestin-1 content in the OS of 2.5%, 5%, 60%, and 100% of wild type (WT) level by two-flash ERG with the first (desensitizing) flash at 160, 400, 1000, and 2500 photons/rod. The time of half recovery (t(half)) in WT retinas increases with the intensity of the initial flash, becoming ~2.5-fold longer upon activation of 2500 than after 160 rhodopsins/rod. Mice with 60% and even 5% of WT arrestin-1 level recovered at WT rates. In contrast, the mice with 2.5% of WT arrestin-1 had a dramatically slower recovery than the other three lines, with the t(half) increasing ~28 fold between 160 and 2500 rhodopsins/rod. Even after the dimmest flash, the rate of recovery of rods with 2.5% of normal arrestin-1 was two times slower than in other lines, indicating that arrestin-1 level in the OS between 100% and 5% of WT is sufficient for rapid recovery, whereas with lower arrestin-1 the rate of recovery dramatically decreases with increased light intensity. Thus, the OS has two distinct pools of arrestin-1: cytoplasmic and a separate pool comprising ~2.5% that is not immediately available for rhodopsin quenching. The observed delay suggests that this pool is localized at the periphery, so that its diffusion across the OS rate-limits the recovery. The line with very low arrestin-1 expression is the first where rhodopsin inactivation was made rate-limiting by arrestin manipulation.",Excluded

METHOD(S): In 27 patients with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors a single intravenous injection of talaporfin sodium (40 mg/m2) was administered one day before surgical resection of the neoplasm. Next day after completion of the tumor removal the residual lesion and/or resection cavity were irradiated with 664-nmsemiconductor laser with a radiation power density of 150 mW/cm2 and radiation energy density of 27 J/cm2. The procedure was performed at 22-27 hours after drug administration. The study cohort included 22 patients with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumor. Thirteen of these neoplasms (59%) were newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RESULT(S): Among all 22 patients included into study cohort the 12-month overall survival (OS), 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), and 6-months local PFS rates after surgery and PDT were 95.5%, 91%, and 91%, respectively. Among patients with newly diagnosed GBM all these parameters were 100%. Side effects on the skin, which could be attributable to administration of talaporfin sodium, were noted in 7% of patients and included rush (2 cases), blister (1 case), and erythema (1 case). Skin photosensitivity test results were relatively mild and fully disappeared within 15 days after administration of photosensitizer in all patients. CONCLUSION(S): Intraoperative PDT using talaporfin sodium and semiconductor laser may be considered as potentially effective and sufficiently safe option for adjuvant management of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors. Its inclusion in combined treatment strategy may have a positive impact on OS and local tumor control, particularly in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.",Excluded
1719,"Properties of paired-pulse firing thresholds and the relationship with paired-pulse plasticity in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses A large variability of paired-pulse plasticity (PPP) has been reported in CA3-CA1 synapses, and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) has long been extensively used as a relative index of release probability (P(r)) from the presynaptic terminal. One of the most common ways of studying P(r) and PPP is to pass paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) through an electrode to fire an action potential (AP), which in turn opens Ca(2+) channels in the presynaptic boutons to evoke transmitter release. However, when the postsynaptic responses were elicited by electrical stimulations, the presynaptic APs were usually not monitored. The reliability of presynaptic activation, the difference of AP firing thresholds between the first and the second pulses of PPS, and its relationship with P(r) and PPP have been largely ignored. Here we show that the AP firing thresholds in the same CA3 pyramidal cells (axons) are obviously lower for the second pulses of the PPS than for the first pulses. When single (or small numbers of) presynaptic axons were stimulated by low-intensity PPS, a large variation in the postsynaptic response probability of the first pulses (P(res1)) and PPP was observed. Increasing stimulation intensities resulted in the conversion of a lower P(res1) and PPF to a higher P(res1) and paired-pulse depression. These results indicate that changes in the reliability of AP initiation by the first pulse of the PPS may account for the high variability of P(res1) and PPP observed in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, therefore PPF may not be a reliable index of P(r) .",Excluded

In this study, by using the patch clamp technique in current clamp mode, we show that activation of this GABA receptor causes voltage changes of cones, which are closely dependent on the membrane potential level in relation to the chloride equilibrium potential of the cells.

Pycnotic cells were found at the base of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in the so-called subgranular zone, as soon as 3 h after irradiation, and were cleared up by active phagocytosis after 48 h. Some of these cells appeared as undifferentiated, whereas others were differentiating granule cells, and possibly immature neuroglia. The extent of cell necrosis was contingent upon the age of the animal, the oldest animal studied (27 months) showing only sparse lesion of that type. Astrocytes and microglia were responsible for the phagocytosis of dead cells. Another type of lesion was found in the nuclei of the mature granule cells and consisted of light spots which appeared 1 h after the irradiation and disappeared almost completely after 48 h. Pyramidal cells did not show any of these two lesions. It is concluded that the laterations in the electrical activity of pyrimidal cells, following irradiation, are at least partly due to lesions affecting the dentate gyrus. Radionecrosis in the subgranular zone is related to the presence of immature cells in this region.",Included
1152,"Clival chordomas: A pathological, surgical, and radiotherapeutic review Background. The purpose of this study was to discuss the optimal management of patients with clival chordomas and provide an up-to-date review of the field. Methods. A schematic description of the anatomy of the clivus and its surrounding structures is provided based on the modular classification of the surgical corridors used in endoscopic skull base surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) techniques are described. Results. The optimal treatment is gross total resection. Recent advances in endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery have allowed very high rates of macroscopic and radiographic complete tumor resection in spite of the challenging location of these lesions. When the tumor location or extension is too lateral or inferior to be effectively resected with an endoscopic approach, an open approach or a combination of endoscopic and open approaches in stages should be considered. Postoperative RT is usually indicated because the likelihood of recurrence is high in spite of complete surgical resection. The main site of recurrence is local and late recurrences are relatively common. The probability of cure is approximately 50% at 10 years and significantly increases when complete tumor resection has been achieved. Conclusion. The preferred treatment for patients with clival chordoma is gross total resection (via endoscopic endonasal surgery when possible) followed by postoperative RT. Treatment at experienced multidisciplinary cranial base centers is key to minimize complications and to enhance the probability of total removal of the tumors.

2550,"Augmented reality guidance for cerebral angiography Purpose: Augmented reality (AR) holds great potential for IR by integrating virtual 3D anatomic models into the real world.1 In this pilot study, we developed an AR guidance system for cerebral angiography, evaluated its impact on radiation, contrast, and fluoroscopy time, and assessed physician response. Materials: In this prospective study, 9 patients with CT or MR imaging of the aorta underwent diagnostic neuroangiography with AR guidance from June to August 2017. Before each procedure, segmentation software was used to create a 3D model of the patient's aortic arch including carotid and vertebral arteries. The model was deployed to HoloLens (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), a stereoscopic optical see-Through AR head-worn display. Using the AR user interface we developed, physicians manipulated a virtual 3D model intraoperatively via voice commands, gaze, and gestures while maintaining sterility. In total, 6 physicians completed 14 postoperative questionnaires assessing the system. 18 casematched retrospective controls were identified by screening for age, aorta imaging, cone-beam CT, indication, physician, and OR. Result(s): All 9 patients underwent diagnostic neuroangiography per standard protocol with AR guidance without complication. Mean kerma-Area product 3150 muGym<sup>2</sup> (SD 2284), skin-Absorbed dose 283 mGy (SD 192), contrast volume 119 mL (SD 35), and fluoroscopy time 10 min (SD 4) were below reference values for diagnostic neuroangiography. <sup>2 3</sup> There was a non-significant reduction in kerma-Area product, skin-Absorbed dose, and fluoroscopy time compared to case-matched controls. 100% of questionnaire responses indicated physicians would recommend the AR system and felt it neither interfered with safety nor increased radiation, contrast, or procedure time. 79% indicated it helped them navigate through vasculature. 93% indicated it was useful to see the 3D model in AR. Conclusion(s): AR guidance for neuroangiography produced clinical outcomes, fluoroscopy times, and radiation doses comparable to those of conventional neuroangiography in matched controls.

1389,"Superficial anatomy of the neonatal cerebrum - an ultrasonographic roadmap Neurosonography is an essential imaging modality for assessing the neonatal brain, particularly as a screening tool to evaluate intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus and periventricular leukomalacia. The primary advantages of neurosonography include portability, accessibility and lack of ionizing radiation. Its main limitations are intrinsic operator dependence and the need for an open fontanelle. Neurosonographic imaging acquisition is typically performed by placing a sector transducer over the anterior fontanelle and following sagittal and coronal sweeps. The sensitivity of neurosonography has markedly improved thanks to the adoption of modern imaging equipment, the use of dedicated head probes, and the employment of advanced diagnostic US techniques. These developments have facilitated more descriptive identification of specific cerebral anatomical details, improving understanding of the cerebral anatomy by conventional US. Such knowledge is fundamental for enhanced diagnostic sensitivity and is a key to understanding pathological states. Furthermore, familiarity with normal anatomy is crucial for understanding pathological states. Our primary goal in this review was to supplement these technological developments with a roadmap to the cerebral landscape. We accomplish this by presenting a systematic approach to using routine US for consistent identification of the most crucial cerebral landmarks, reviewing their relationship with adjacent structures, and briefly describing their primary function.",Excluded
2646,"Radiation in the management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors Background: Radiation therapy (RT) has not historically been incorporated into multidisciplinary management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNTs). We provide a two-institution series of patients with PNTs who were treated with external beam RT either neoadjuvantly to attempt down-staging for surgery, or in the setting of post-surgical recurrence. Our objective was to assess treatment response and outcomes in this cohort of patients. Method(s): We identified eleven patients with a pathologic diagnosis of PNT from 2006-2011 who received external beam RT to the primary tumor or resection bed. Each institution's electronic medical record was used to evaluate patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment regimens and tolerance, radiographic response, and survival. Result(s): Our series consists of eleven patients (6 men, 5 women) with a mean age of 57 years (range 37-72 years). All had biopsy proven PNT and were clinically T3 (n=3) or T4 (n=8), M0. Five patients were clinically node positive. All patients received RT to the primary tumor or resection bed to a median dose of 50.4 Gy. Seven patients received concurrent chemotherapy with capecitabine at a median dose of 1000mg/m<sup>2</sup> bid. Nine patients were treated definitively for locally advanced disease, two of whom subsequently underwent surgical resection. Two patients were treated to palliate post-resection recurrence. Initial radiographic response to RT included 2 complete responses (CR), 2 partial responses (PR), 4 stable disease, 3 progressive disease (PD). Two patients were classified as PD due to the development of distant metastases less than 2 months after completing RT. Two grade 3 toxicities were documented (one early, one late). At a median follow-up of 30.4 months, three patients had died with evidence of PD, two had died without evidence of PD, three were alive with metastases, and three were alive without evidence of disease progression (1 stable, 1 PR, 1 CR). From the start of RT, median overall survival was 32.1 months; progression free survival was 14.6 months. Conclusion(s): RT may have the potential to convert PNTs from locally-advanced to resectable.

597,"Cranial irradiation alters dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus Therapeutic irradiation of the brain is a common treatment modality for brain tumors, but can lead to impairment of cognitive function. Dendritic spines are sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in spine structure and number are thought to represent a morphological correlate of altered brain functions associated with hippocampal dependent learning and memory. To gain some insight into the temporal and sub region specific cellular changes in the hippocampus following brain irradiation, we investigated the effects of 10 Gy cranial irradiation on dendritic spines in young adult mice. One week or 1 month post irradiation, changes in spine density and morphology in dentate gyrus (DG) granule and CA1 pyramidal neurons were quantified using Golgi staining. Our results showed that in the DG, there were significant reductions in spine density at both 1 week (11.9%) and 1 month (26.9%) after irradiation. In contrast, in the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, irradiation resulted in a significant reduction (18.7%) in spine density only at 1 week post irradiation. Analysis of spine morphology showed that irradiation led to significant decreases in the proportion of mushroom spines at both time points in the DG as well as CA1 basal dendrites. The proportions of stubby spines were significantly increased in both the areas at 1 month post irradiation. Irradiation did not alter spine density in the CA1 apical dendrites, but there were significant changes in the proportion of thin and mushroom spines at both time points post irradiation. Although the mechanisms involved are not clear, these findings are the first to show that brain irradiation of young adult animals leads to alterations in dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus in a time dependent and region specific manner.",Included
3555,"Patterning the cone mosaic array in zebrafish retina requires specification of ultraviolet-sensitive cones Cone photoreceptors in teleost fish are organized in precise, crystalline arrays in the epithelial plane of the retina. In zebrafish, four distinct morphological/spectral cone types occupy specific, invariant positions within a regular lattice. The cone lattice is aligned orthogonal and parallel to circumference of the retinal hemisphere: it emerges as cones generated in a germinal zone at the retinal periphery are incorporated as single-cell columns into the cone lattice. Genetic disruption of the transcription factor Tbx2b eliminates most of the cone subtype maximally sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths and also perturbs the long-range organization of the cone lattice. In the tbx2b mutant, the other three cone types (red, green, and blue cones) are specified in the correct proportion, differentiate normally, and acquire normal, planar polarized adhesive interactions mediated by Crumbs 2a and Crumbs 2b. Quantitative image analysis of cell adjacency revealed that the cones in the tbx2b mutant primarily have two nearest neighbors and align in single-cell-wide column fragments that are separated by rod photoreceptors. Some UV cones differentiate at the dorsal retinal margin in the tbx2b mutant, although they are severely dysmorphic and are eventually eliminated. Incorporating loss of UV cones during formation of cone columns at the margin into our previously published mathematical model of zebrafish cone mosaic formation (which uses bidirectional interactions between planar cell polarity proteins and anisotropic mechanical stresses in the plane of the retinal epithelium to generate regular columns of cones parallel to the margin) reproduces many features of the pattern disruptions seen in the tbx2b mutant.",Excluded
3591,"Posture, locomotion, spatial orientation, and motion sickness as a function of space flight This article summarizes a variety of newly published findings obtained by the Neuroscience Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, and attempts to place this work within a historical framework of previous results on posture, locomotion, motion sickness, and perceptual responses that have been observed in conjunction with space flight. In this context, we have taken the view that correct transduction and integration of signals from all sensory systems is essential to maintaining stable vision, postural and locomotor control, and eye-hand coordination as components of spatial orientation. The plasticity of the human central nervous system allows individuals to adapt to altered stimulus conditions encountered in a microgravity environment. However, until some level of adaptation is achieved, astronauts and cosmonauts often experience space motion sickness, disturbances in motion control and eye-hand coordination, unstable vision, and illusory motion of the self, the visual scene, or both. Many of the same types of disturbances encountered in space flight reappear immediately after crew members return to earth. The magnitude of these neurosensory, sensory-motor and perceptual disturbances, and the time needed to recover from them, tend to vary as a function of mission duration and the space travelers prior experience with the stimulus rearrangement of space flight. To adequately chart the development of neurosensory changes associated with space flight, we recommend development of enhanced eye movement systems and body position measurement. We also advocate the use of a human small radius centrifuge as both a research tool and as a means of providing on-orbit countermeasures that will lessen the impact of living for long periods of time with out exposure to altering gravito-inertial forces.",Excluded
1707,"Focused Ultrasound-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Opening Enhances GSK-3 Inhibitor Delivery for Amyloid-Beta Plaque Reduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is the leading cause of age-related dementia. Currently, therapeutic agent delivery to the CNS is a valued approach for AD therapy. Unfortunately, the CNS penetration is greatly hampered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Focused-ultrasound (FUS) has been demonstrated to temporally open the BBB, thus promoting therapeutic agent delivery to the CNS. Recently, the BBB opening procedure was further reported to clear the deposited Abeta plaque due to microglia activation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the use of FUS-induced BBB opening to enhance GSK-3 inhibitor delivery, which would bring additive effect of Abeta plaque clearance by FUS with the reduction of Abeta plaque synthesis by GSK-3 inhibitor in an AD mice model. FUS-induced BBB opening on APPswe/PSEN1-dE9 transgenic mice was performed unilaterally, with the contralateral hemisphere serving as a reference. GSK-3 level was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and autoradiography (ARG) was also conducted to quantitatively confirm the Abeta plaque reduction. Results from IHC showed GSK-3 inhibitor effectively reduced GSK-3 activity up to 61.3% with the addition of FUS-BBB opening and confirming the proposed therapeutic route. ARG also showed significant Abeta-plaque reduction up to 31.5%.

1809,"Evaluation of effective dose from a RANDO phantom in videofluorography diagnostic procedures for diagnosing dysphagia Objectives: Videofluorography (VF) is useful for diagnosing dysphagia; however, few reports have investigated appropriate effective doses for VF. The present study aimed to estimate the effective radiation dose in VF for diagnosis of dysphagia. Method(s): Radiation doses to tissues and organs were measured using the anthropomorphic RANDO woman phantom as an equivalent to the human body. Effective doses were estimated according to the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) 60 in 1990 and IRCP 103 in 2007. The tissues measured were those recommended by ICRP 60 and ICRP 103 including gonads (ovaries and testes), red bone marrow and tissues in which excessive radiation commonly causes malignant tumours including lung, thyroid gland, stomach, large intestine, liver, oesophagus, bladder, breast, bone marrow, skin, brain and salivary gland. Skin dose was also measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters. Result(s): Using ICRP 103, the effective dose was estimated as 118.1 muSv at a tube voltage of 50 kV and 82.4 muSv at 45 kV.

Conclusion(s): Using ICRP 103, the effective dose for VF per examination at a total estimation time of 1 min was estimated as approximately 2.5-8.3 times that observed for digital panoramic radiography and 1/12 to 3 times depending on the measurement device for cone beam CT (CBCT). This value can be decreased in the future using a smaller irradiation field and decreased time for examination in VF in the future. Â© 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Excluded
2819,"Paralysis following stereotactic spinal irradiation in pigs suggests a tolerance constraint for single-session irradiation of the spinal nerve BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Paralysis observed during a study of vertebral bone tolerance to single-session irradiation led to further study of the dose-related incidence of motor peripheral neuropathy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a bone tolerance study, cervical spinal nerves of 15 minipigs received bilateral irradiation to levels C5-C8 distributed into three dose groups with mean maximum spinal nerve doses of 16.9 +/- 0.3 Gy (n=5), 18.7 +/- 0.5 Gy (n=5), and 24.3 +/- 0.8 Gy (n=5). Changes developing in the gait of the group of pigs receiving a mean maximum dose of 24.3 Gy after 10-15 weeks led to the irradiation of two additional animals. They received mean maximum dose of 24.9 +/- 0.2 Gy (n=2), targeted to the left spinal nerves of C5-C8. The followup period was one year. Histologic sections from spinal cords and available spinal nerves were evaluated. MR imaging was performed on pigs in the 24.9 Gy group.RESULTS: No pig that received a maximum spinal nerve point dose <=19.0 Gy experienced a change in gait while all pigs that received >=24.1 Gy experienced paralysis. Extensive degeneration and fibrosis were observed in irradiated spinal nerves of the 24.9 Gy animals. All spinal cord sections were normal. Irradiated spinal nerve regions showed increased thickness and hypointensity on MR imaging.CONCLUSION: The single-session tolerance dose of the cervical spinal nerves lies between 19.0 and 24.1 Gy for this model.",Included
3228,"Contour variability during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment planning and the effect of physician training Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate inter- and intra-observer contouring variability during treatment planning for stage I lung cancers treated with SBRT, and to assess the effect of contouring training for physicians. Materials/Methods: Nine radiation oncologists (3 attendings, 6 residents) contoured the lung tumor internal target volumes (ITVs) in 6 patients using maximum intensity projection (MIP) images after 4D-CT simulation. Contouring was performed independently at 3 separate time points: prior to training based on department standards, after completing contouring training, and >2 weeks after the second session. Contouring variability was evaluated for variations in the magnitude of volumes (coefficient of variation (COV) = standard deviation/mean volume), the volume overlap (conformality index (CI) = common volume/encompassing volume), and differences in the centroid location. Contours were also compared clinically to determine radiographic features resulting in larger disagreement. Result(s): The mean volumes in cm3 for session 1, 2 and 3 were 6.52, 6.98 and 7.20 respectively. The mean COV for sessions 1 (0.25 +/- 0.05), 2 (0.24 +/- 0.04) and 3 (0.19 +/- 0.03) demonstrated significant improvement from session 1 to 3 (p = 0.03) while the CI also improved with each session, 0.35 +/-0.07, 0.36 +/-0.03 and 0.44 +/-0.04, respectively (p = 0.03 from session 1 to 3). Average differences (mm) of the mean centroid positions in the lateral, anterior-posterior, and cranial-caudal directions demonstrated decreased variability from session 1, 0.3+/-0.3, 0.3+/-0.3 and 0.5+/-0.5, to session 3, 0.2+/-0.2, 0.2+/-0.2, 0.3+/-0.3 respectively (p = ns). Differences in resident vs. attending COV 0.31+/-0.06 vs. 0.09+/-0.05 (p<0.001) and CI 0.37+/-0.08 vs. 0.69+/-0.03 (p<0.001) for session 1 and COV 0.20+/-0.04 vs. 0.19+/-0.05 (p = 0.78) and CI 0.50+/-0.05 vs. 0.63+/-0.05 (p = 0.002) for session 3 demonstrated training improved resident contouring towards attending levels. Intra-observer variability for sessions 1 vs. 2 and sessions 2 vs. 3 showed a non significant improvement in the differences between mean volumes 18%+/-13% vs. 11%+/-8% as well as CI 0.78+/-0.05 vs. 0.81+/-0.06. Conclusion(s): While there is large variation in contoured volumes, the centroid locations show excellent agreement. Intra- is smaller than interobserver variability; both can be improved with repeat contouring and standardized training, particularly in less experienced observers. Clinically, variability was most relevant for lesions with pleural attachments and spiculae suggesting a need for a standardized approach to contour such lesions.",Excluded

963,"The mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus reduces cell proliferation and enhances radiosensitivity of primary meningioma cells irradiated by photons or carbon ions-preliminary results Background. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) was found to be dysregulated in various cancers and an association of the activation of mTORC1 with meningioma and schwannoma growth was reported. The pharmaceutical inhibition of mTOR was identified as a potential strategy for the augmentation of radiation-induced cell damages in different cancers although the detailed molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. Furthermore as mTOR inhibitors particularly show suppression of double-strand break repair a role for a combined therapy by mTOR-inhibitors and carbon ion irradiation is to hypothesize. Our aim was to analyse the effect of the mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus alone and in combination with irradiation by photons or carbon ions in primary human meningioma cells. Methods. Tumour specimens from 6 patients suffering from meningiomas, 4 with WHO Grad I and 2 with WHO Grade II, were obtained after surgical resection from the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Saarland, Homburg/Saar, Germany, plated on tissue culture plates and cultured under standard conditions as previously described. Primary cells up to passage 7 were treated with irradiation by carbon ions (0.125 to 2 Gy) or photons (0.5 to 8 Gy) alone and in combination with Temsirolimus (0.5 to 2 muM). Furthermore meningioma cells were treated with Temsirolimus alone (0.5 to 5 muM). Cell proliferation was measured by counting cells 6 days after treatment. Results. A dose-dependent reduction of meningioma cells was observed after irradiation by photons as well as by carbon ions. The biological impact on cell reduction after irradiation by carbon ions seems to be four times stronger in comparison to irradiation by photons. The treatment with Temsirolimus alone in a concentration up to 5 muM causes a cell reduction of 69% in benign WHO Grade I meningioma cells whereas WHO Grade II meningioma cells were only reduced by 31%. The combination of irradiation and Temsirolimus in concentrations up to 2 muM effects a further cell reduction for both carbon ions (0.5 Gy) and photons (2 Gy) up to 30% in comparisons to irradiation alone. Conclusion. Our study shows promising preliminary results regarding the antiproliferative effect on meningioma cells by mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus alone and as a radiosensitizer in combination with irradiation by photons or carbon ions. Further experiments have to be performed to confirm these results.",Excluded

Multinomial logistic regression and one-way analyses of variance were used to examine the differences among subgroups.MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Depressed mood, cognitive disturbance, fatigue, insomnia, pain, and functional performance.FINDINGS: Patients were classified into four distinct subgroups based on their symptom cluster experience: all low symptom, high fatigue and low pain, high pain, and all high symptom. Such patient classification patterns were consistent across the treatment trajectory, although group memberships were inconsistent. After initiating treatment, two additional subgroups emerged: high depressed mood and cognitive disturbance, and high fatigue and insomnia. Subgroups differed in physical performance status at baseline, symptom burden, and treatment modality in a relatively consistent pattern across time points. Patients in the all-high-symptom subgroup experienced the most serious limitations in activities across all time points.CONCLUSIONS: Patient subgroups exist that share the unique experience of psychoneurologic symptoms.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Findings are useful to determine who needs more intensive symptom management during cancer treatment. Future studies should examine whether specific symptom management strategies are more efficient for certain subgroups.",Excluded

1122,"Optimised BNCT facility based on a compact D-D neutron generator Background: Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a very promising treatment for patients suffering gliobastoma multiforme, an aggressive type of brain cancer, where conventional radiation therapies fail. Thermal neutrons are suitable for the direct treatment of cancers which are located at near-tissue-surface; deep-seated tumors need harder, epithermal neutron energy spectra. Material(s) and Method(s): In this work a BNCT facility based on a compact D-D neutron generator, has been simulated using the MCNP4B Monte Carlo code. The materials considered, for the design of the facility, were chosen according to the EU Directive 2002/95/EC, hence, excluded the use of cadmium and lead. Result(s): An extensive set of calculations performed with MCNP4B Mote Carlo code have show that the combination of TiF<inf>3</inf> which integrates a conic part made of D<inf>2</inf>O, then followed by a TiF<inf>3</inf> layer is the optimum moderator design. The use of BiF3 as spectrum shifter and y rays filter, Titanium as fast neutron filter and Lithium as thermal neutron filter is necessary in order to obtain an epithermal neutron beam with high quality.

Ten years before, the patient had received radiation therapy (66 Gy) and radical resection for a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the right infrapharyngeal space. A cerebral angiogram showed bilateral severe ICA stenosis (right; 90%, left; 99%). We diagnosed this as radiation-induced ICA stenosis, and performed carotid angioplasty with a self-expanding stent. The post-operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged without neurological deficits. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is difficult in the case of carotid artery stenosis due to radiation-induced arterial injury.

The dose analysis shows that 59% of the brain received a dose in excess of the reference surface dose, and that portions of the brain received doses greater than 300% of the reference surface dose. The regions of high dose are illustrated in isodose distributions. This information may be useful in evaluating potential tumor induction following radiation exposure.",Included
2937,"Prospective study of fatigue in localized prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy The objectives were to (1) prospectively evaluate fatigue utilizing validated instruments in patients with localized prostate cancer, and (2) examine the relationships between fatigue, depression, quality of life, and sleep disturbance. The instruments used included: Piper Fatigue Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate Scale. Data on cancer stage, prostate specific antigen levels, hematocrit, patient's body weight and radiation dosage were recorded. Patients were evaluated preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy, and at 4-5 weeks follow-up. Thirty-six veterans with localized prostate cancer were studied. Mean age was 66.9 years (range 55-79). Duration of treatment was 7-8 weeks. Univariate procedure and Wilcoxon Signed Rank-test were used to examine changes in pretreatment scores for each of the three subsequent study periods. To adjust for multiple comparisons Bonferroni test was used. Spearman Correlations were calculated among parameters. No significant changes were noted in mean scores of hematocrit and body weight during the study period. On the Piper Fatigue Scale, adjusted for multiple comparisons, the median scores were significantly higher at completion of radiotherapy as compared with preradiotherapy values. Three patients (8%) were experienced fatigue according to Piper Fatigue Scale before treatment as compared to nine patients (25%) at completion of radiotherapy. On Prostate Cancer Specific and Physical Well Being subscales of the Functional Assessment for Prostate Cancer Therapy, the scores were significantly lower at middle and completion of radiotherapy than at pretreatment. At preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy and follow-up evaluation, patients scoring higher on the Piper Fatigue Scale were more likely to report a poorer quality of Physical Well Being on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostates. No significant changes were noted in the Beck Depression Inventory and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores during treatment. Eight patients scored 10 or more on the Beck Depression Inventory before starting radiotherapy, suggesting depressive symptomatology. Of these, only seven patients scored 10 or more at completion of treatment. The incidence of fatigue is lower in our study than in previously published data. A relationship exists between fatigue scores and physical well being subscale scores. Higher scores on the Piper Fatigue Scale at the completion of radiotherapy, as well as no changes on depression and sleepiness scales, suggest that fatigue may not be the result of depression or sleep disturbance. Based upon our previous work, we propose that the physical expression of fatigue may be secondary to a decline in neuromuscular efficiency and enhanced muscle fatigue.",Excluded
2289,"Overview of results of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 3 radiolabeled somatostatin analogs A new treatment modality for inoperable or metastasized gastroenteropancreatic tumors is the use of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs. Initial studies with high doses of [(111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)(0)]octreotide in patients with metastasized neuroendocrine tumors were encouraging, although partial remissions were uncommon. Another radiolabeled somatostatin analog that is used for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is [(90)Y-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide. Various phase 1 and phase 2 PRRT trials have been performed with this compound. Despite differences in the protocols used, complete and partial remissions in most of the studies with [(90)Y-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide were in the same ranges, 10%-30%; these ranges were higher than those obtained with [(111)In-DTPA(0)]octreotide. Treatment with the newest radiolabeled somatostatin analog, [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate, which has a higher affinity for the subtype 2 somatostatin receptor, resulted in complete or partial remissions in 30% of 76 patients. Tumor regression was positively correlated with a high level of uptake on OctreoScan imaging, a limited hepatic tumor mass, and a high Karnofsky performance score. Treatment with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs is a promising new tool in the management of patients with inoperable or metastasized neuroendocrine tumors. Symptomatic improvement may occur with all (111)In-, (90)Y-, or (177)Lu-labeled somatostatin analogs that have been used for PRRT. The results obtained with [(90)Y-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide and [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate are very encouraging in terms of tumor regression. Also, if kidney protective agents are used, the side effects of this therapy are few and mild, and the duration of the therapy response for both radiopharmaceuticals is more than 2 y. These data compare favorably with those for the limited number of alternative treatment approaches. [References: 19]",Excluded
894,"Cell type-specific hypersensitivity to oxidative damage in CSB and XPA mice Mutations in the CSB gene cause Cockayne syndrome (CS), a rare inherited disorder, characterized by UV-sensitivity, severe neurodevelopmental and progeroid symptoms. CSB functions in the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), responsible for the removal of UV-induced and other helix-distorting lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. Several lines of evidence support the notion that the CSB TCR defect extends to other non-NER type transcription-blocking lesions, notably various kinds of oxidative damage, which may provide an explanation for part of the severe CS phenotype. We used genetically defined mouse models to examine the relationship between the CSB defect and sensitivity to oxidative damage in different cell types and at the level of the intact organism. The main conclusions are: (1) CSB(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit a clear hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, extending the findings in genetically heterogeneous human CSB fibroblasts to another species. (2) CSB(-/-) MEFs are highly sensitive to paraquat, strongly indicating that the increased cytotoxicity is due to oxidative damage. (3) The hypersenstivity is independent of genetic background and directly related to the CSB defect and is not observed in totally NER-deficient XPA MEFs. (4) Wild type embryonic stem (ES) cells display an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation compared to fibroblasts. Surprisingly, the CSB deficiency has only a very minor additional effect on ES cell sensitivity to oxidative damage and is comparable to that of an XPA defect, indicating cell type-specific differences in the contribution of TCR and NER to cellular survival. (5) Similar to ES cells, CSB and XPA mice both display a minor sensitivity to whole-body X-ray exposure. This suggests that the response of an intact organism to radiation is largely determined by the sensitivity of stem cells, rather than differentiated cells. These findings establish the role of transcription-coupled repair in resistance to oxidative damage and reveal a cell- and organ-specific impact of this repair pathway to the clinical phenotype of CS and XP.",Excluded

[Japanese] We summarize the results of gamma knife treatment for dural arterivenous fistula (DAVF), are report our study. Since the early 1990s, DAVFs have been treated in the same manner as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), i.e., by radiosurgery, performed with or without embolization. DAVFs in the cavernous sinus, transverse-sigmoid sinus, and cerebellar tent were treated with a marginal dose of 18 to 20 Gy. The current obliteration rates of DAVF reported in literature are not low when compared with those of AVM. Excellent DAVF obliteration rates were observed in our study, which were similar to those reported in the literature. In fact, complete response (CR) was observed in 9 cases, partial response (PR) in 9 cases, and partical obliteration in 6 cases during the mean follow-up of 27 months. Moreover, considerable neurological improvements were noted, which apparently began at an early stage post radiosurgery. Bleeding was observed 2 cases associated with cortical reflux during the follow-up. In conclusion, radiosurgery for DAVF is very useful for both the obliteration of the fistula and for the improvement of clinical signs. However, prior to performing radiosurgery, the lesions with cortical reflux should be interrupted by initially treated with surgery or embolization.",Excluded

Confidence in medical evaluations with increasing levels of laboratory testing and imaging was rated on a 100-point visual analog scale. Knowledge of radiation exposure was ascertained when participants compared the radiation dose of one abdomen-pelvis CT with 2-view chest radiography. To assess cancer risk knowledge, participants rated their agreement with these factual statements: ""Approximately 2 to 3 abdominal CTs give the same radiation exposure as experienced by Hiroshima survivors"" and ""2 to 3 abdominal CTs over a person's lifetime can increase cancer risk."" Previous CT was also assessed.RESULTS: There were 1,168 participants, 67% women and mean age 40.7 years (SD 15.9 years). Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor. Median agreement with the Hiroshima statement was 13 (95% CI 10 to 16) and 45 (95% CI 40 to 45) with the increased lifetime cancer risk statement. Seven hundred ninety-five patients reported receiving a previous CT. Of 365 patients who reported no previous CT, 142 (39%) had one documented in our electronic medical record.CONCLUSION: Patients are more confident when CT imaging is part of their medical evaluation but have a poor understanding of the concomitant radiation exposure and risk and underestimate their previous imaging experience.",Excluded

This study investigated via simulation, for the first time, how the spatial pattern of excitation affects the response of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expressing neurons. First we described a methodology for modeling ChR2 in the NEURON simulation platform. Then, we compared four most commonly considered illumination strategies (somatic, dendritic, axonal and whole cell) in a paradigmatic model of a cortical layer V pyramidal cell. We show that the spatial pattern of illumination has an important impact on the efficiency of stimulation and the kinetics of the spiking output. Whole cell illumination synchronizes the depolarization of the dendritic tree and the soma and evokes spiking characteristics with a distinct pattern including an increased bursting rate and enhanced back propagation of action potentials (bAPs). This type of illumination is the most efficient as a given irradiance threshold was achievable with only 6 % of ChR2 density needed in the case of somatic illumination. Targeting only the axon initial segment requires a high ChR2 density to achieve a given threshold irradiance and a prolonged illumination does not yield sustained spiking. We also show that patterned illumination can be used to modulate the bAPs and hence spatially modulate the direction and amplitude of spike time dependent plasticity protocols. We further found the irradiance threshold to increase in proportion to the demyelination level of an axon, suggesting that measurements of the irradiance threshold (for example relative to the soma) could be used to remotely probe a loss of neural myelin sheath, which is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases.",Excluded

In the present study, our goals were to detect the functional and morphological changes that result in the administration of l-alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC), a deacylated derivative of phosphatidylcholine, in a rodent model of hippocampus irradiation. Anaesthetized SPRD rats were subjected to 40-Gy irradiation of one hemisphere of the brain, with or without GPC treatment (50 mg/kg per os). After the irradiation the rats received GPC or the vehicle at the same time every second day at 5 days per week. The effects of partial rat brain irradiation on the spatial orientation and learning ability of rats were assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, which was performed once before and two times after the irradiation. At the same time morphological changes were detected by MRI to define the time-point for histological examinations. Irradiation of 40-Gy resulted in moderate neurological deficit both at the level of cognitive function and morphology after 4 weeks of irradiation. The MWM test was found to be a highly sensitive tool for the detection of neurofunctional impairment. We found that the place navigational function of the ratswas impaired by the irradiation and the treatment with GPC could prevent this damage. Marked protective effect of the GPC was detected as concerns of the histopathological findings. Targeted brain irradiation induced notable changes in the central nervous system.

All patients underwent pretreatment evaluation at the university's Multidisciplinary Lung Cancer Center. Most patients (87%) had complete mediastinoscopy staging, and all were believed to be poor candidates for up-front operation because of bulky extent of disease. The radiotherapy program used conventional, 2-dimensionally planned treatment to 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8- to 2-Gy fraction size. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of etoposide/cisplatin or carboplatin/paclitaxel. Study end points included resectability, pathologic response, local-regional control, survival, and toxicity. An exploratory comparison between pathologic response and long-term survival was performed. An exploratory comparison between older chemotherapy (etoposide/cisplatin) and third-generation chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) was also performed.RESULTS: Of 53 patients, 45 (85%) were deemed surgical candidates after induction therapy. Twenty-two (42% of the initial cohort) patients had a major pathologic response to stage 0, I, or II disease. The 5-year actuarial survival was 31%. Major pathologic response was associated with improved survival (48% vs 24%; P =.027). The overall rate of early death potentially related to therapy in this series was 9%; this mostly occurred in patients who underwent right pneumonectomy. There was no difference in efficacy or mortality between etoposide/cisplatin and radiotherapy versus carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiotherapy, although the latter regimen was associated with less grade 3 or higher acute toxicity necessitating interruption or hospitalization during neoadjuvant treatment (P =.02). In-field local control was achieved in 83% of all patients (90% of the patients who underwent resection). Brain metastases as the first site of treatment failure occurred in 23% of all patients.CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation delivers high resectability, major pathologic response rate, and excellent local-regional control, with encouraging long-term survival considering the patient population studied. Major pathologic response correlates with long-term survival. Neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiotherapy is an appropriate framework on which to add new therapies.",Excluded

Differences in survival between DS-GPA groups were tested with Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and log-rank tests.RESULTS: In total 367 patients were included in the analysis. Median survival in our cohort is largely comparable to corresponding DS-GPA cohorts, but some notable differences are present. There was a significantly shorter median survival (15.4months, compared to 26.5months) in the adenocarcinoma NSCLC subgroup with a GPA score of 2.3-3. We confirmed the significant differences in survival time for most cancer-specific subgroups.CONCLUSION: DS-GPA seems to be a reliable tool to classify patients with brain metastases treated with SRS into prognostic subgroups. However, we found some aberrations from predicted median survival times, which may be due to specific characteristics of the populations of patients treated with SRS versus other patients.",Excluded
2496,"Abciximab (ReoPro) Dosing Strategy for the Management of Acute Intraprocedural Thromboembolic Complications during Pipeline Flow Diversion Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms Background: Flow diversion with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) is an effective neuro-endovascular method and increasingly accepted for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Acute in situ thrombosis is a known complication of PED procedures. There is limited experience in the flow diversion literature on the use of abciximab (ReoPro) for the management of acute thrombus formation in PED cases. Method(s): Data were collected retrospectively on patients who received intra-arterial (IA) ReoPro with or without subsequent intravenous (IV) infusion during PED flow diversion treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Result(s): A total of 30 cases in patients with a mean age of 56.7 years (range 36-84) and a mean aneurysm size of 8.6 mm (range 2-25) were identified to have intraprocedural thromboembolic complications during PED treatment. IA ReoPro was administered in all cases, with 20 cases receiving increments of 5-mg boluses and 10 cases receiving a 0.125 mg/kg IA bolus (half cardiac dosing). Complete or partial recanalization was achieved in 100% of the cases. IV ReoPro infusion at 0.125 mug/kg/min for 12 h was administered postprocedurally in 22 cases with a residual thrombus. Postprocedurally, 18 patients were transitioned from clopidogrel (Plavix) to prasugrel (Effient). The majority of the cases (23/30; 77%) were discharged home. Periprocedural intracranial hemorrhage was noted in 2 cases (7%) and radiographic infarct was noted in 4 cases (13%), with an overall mortality of 0% at the time of initial discharge. Clinical follow-up was available for 28/30 patients. The average duration of follow-up was 11.7 months, at which time 23/28 (82%) of the patients had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0. Conclusion(s): IA ReoPro administration is an effective and safe rescue strategy for the management of acute intraprocedural thromboembolic complications during PED treatment. Using a dosing strategy of either 5-mg increments or a 0.125 mg/kg IA bolus (half cardiac dosing) can provide high rates of recanalization with low rates of hemorrhagic complications and long-term morbidity.

1305,"Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and structural chromosome aberration in mutagenicity testing Data from previous studies published on the induction by mutagens of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and structural chromosome damage were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. Although a good correlation between the incidence of both cytogenetic phenomena has been pointed out in many previous publications, about 30% of the agents for which comparable data were available yielded non-corresponding qualitative results concerning both indicator effects. However, even in groups with good qualitative agreement distinct quantitative differences indicated different molecular mechanisms of the formation of SCEs and breaks. Additional information supporting the importance of these differences for the validity of both indicator systems has been derived from the results obtained using strong clastogens exhibiting a low or no SCE-inducing activity and vice versa, from special observations on chromosomal breakage syndromes, and from studies on the action of known co- and anti-clastogens on SCE-induction by chemical mutagens. As a result, it has been suggested that the SCE-technique should be considered as a valuable additional method for cytogenetic mutagenicity testing, which, however, is not adequate to replace the classical methods of analysis of structural chromosome damage.

1182,"Evaluation of Lower-Dose Spiral Head CT for Detection of Intracranial Findings Causing Neurologic Deficits BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the frequent use of unenhanced head CT for the detection of acute neurologic deficit, the radiation dose for this exam varies widely. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of lower-dose head CT for detection of intracranial findings resulting in acute neurologic deficit.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Projection data from 83 patients undergoing unenhanced spiral head CT for suspected neurologic deficits were collected. Cases positive for infarction, intra-axial hemorrhage, mass, or extra-axial hemorrhage required confirmation by histopathology, surgery, progression of findings, or corresponding neurologic deficit; cases negative for these target diagnoses required negative assessments by two neuroradiologists and a clinical neurologist. A routine dose head CT was obtained using 250 effective mAs and iterative reconstruction. Lower-dose configurations were reconstructed (25-effective mAs iterative reconstruction, 50-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection). Three neuroradiologists circled findings, indicating diagnosis, confidence (0-100), and image quality. The difference between the jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit at routine and lower-dose configurations was estimated. A lower 95% CI estimate of the difference greater than -0.10 indicated noninferiority.RESULTS: Forty-two of 83 patients had 70 intracranial findings (29 infarcts, 25 masses, 10 extra- and 6 intra-axial hemorrhages) at routine head CT (CT dose index = 38.3 mGy). The routine-dose jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81-0.93). Noninferiority was shown for 100-effective mAs iterative reconstruction (figure of merit difference, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.004) and 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection (-0.02; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.02) but not for 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection (-0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02) or lower-dose levels. Image quality was better at higher-dose levels and with iterative reconstruction (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Observer performance for dose levels using 100-200 eff mAs was noninferior to that observed at 250 effective mAs with iterative reconstruction, with iterative reconstruction preserving noninferiority at a mean CT dose index of 15.2 mGy.",Excluded
3005,"Sparing of tissue by using micro-slit-beam radiation therapy reduces neurotoxicity compared with broad-beam radiation therapy Micro-slit-beam radiation therapy (MRT) using synchrotron-generated X-ray beams allows for extremely high-dose irradiation. However, the toxicity of MRT in central nervous system (CNS) use is still unknown. To gather baseline toxicological data, we evaluated mortality in normal mice following CNS-targeted MRT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Synchrotron X-ray-beam radiation was provided by the SPring-8 BL28B2 beam-line. For MRT, radiation was delivered to groups of mice in a 10 x 12 mm unidirectional array consisting of 25-mum-wide beams spaced 100, 200 or 300 mum apart; another group of mice received the equivalent broad-beam radiation therapy (BRT) for comparison. Peak and valley dose rates of the MRT were 120 and 0.7 Gy/s, respectively. Delivered doses were 96-960 Gy for MRT, and 24-120 Gy for BRT. Mortality was monitored for 90 days post-irradiation. Brain tissue was stained using hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate neural structure. Demyelination was evaluated by Kluver-Barrera staining. The LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>100</sub> when using MRT were 600 Gy and 720 Gy, respectively, and when using BRT they were 80 Gy and 96 Gy, respectively. In MRT, mortality decreased as the center-to-center beam spacing increased from 100 mum to 300 mum. Cortical architecture was well preserved in MRT, whereas BRT induced various degrees of cerebral hemorrhage and demyelination. MRT was able to deliver extremely high doses of radiation, while still minimizing neuronal death. The valley doses, influenced by beam spacing and irradiated dose, could represent important survival factors for MRT.",Included
1746,"The susceptibility of the retina to photochemical damage from visible light The photoreceptor/RPE complex must maintain a delicate balance between maximizing the absorption of photons for vision and retinal image quality while simultaneously minimizing the risk of photodamage when exposed to bright light. We review the recent discovery of two new effects of light exposure on the photoreceptor/RPE complex in the context of current thinking about the causes of retinal phototoxicity. These effects are autofluorescence photobleaching in which exposure to bright light reduces lipofuscin autofluorescence and, at higher light levels, RPE disruption in which the pattern of autofluorescence is permanently altered following light exposure. Both effects occur following exposure to visible light at irradiances that were previously thought to be safe. Photopigment, retinoids involved in the visual cycle, and bisretinoids in lipofuscin have been implicated as possible photosensitizers for photochemical damage. The mechanism of RPE disruption may follow either of these paths. On the other hand, autofluorescence photobleaching is likely an indicator of photooxidation of lipofuscin. The permanent changes inherent in RPE disruption might require modification of the light safety standards. AF photobleaching recovers after several hours although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet clear. Understanding the mechanisms of phototoxicity is all the more important given the potential for increased susceptibility in the presence of ocular diseases that affect either the visual cycle and/or lipofuscin accumulation. In addition, knowledge of photochemical mechanisms can improve our understanding of some disease processes that may be influenced by light exposure, such as some forms of Leber's congenital amaurosis, and aid in the development of new therapies. Such treatment prior to intentional light exposures, as in ophthalmic examinations or surgeries, could provide an effective preventative strategy.",Excluded
2433,"Marked rapid alterations in nocturnal pineal serotonin metabolism in mice and rats exposed to weak intermittent magnetic fields Adult AMES mice and male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to an artificial magnetic field, generated by Helmholtz coils. 3.5 hours after the onset of darkness the coils were activated for one hour resulting in an inversion of the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field. The coils were activated and deactivated at 5 min intervals during the 1 hour exposure period. In both mice and rats, the levels of serotonin in the pineal were markedly increased by the exposure. In rats, an increase of pineal 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid and a decrease of the activity of the pineal enzyme serotonin-N-acetyltransferase also was observed. However, pineal and serum melatonin levels were not altered. The results indicate that the metabolism of serotonin in the pineal is quickly affected by the exposure of animals to a magnetic field.",Excluded
3352,"Gamma radiation (5-10 Gy) impairs neuronal function in the guinea pig hippocampus Guinea pigs were exposed to 5 and 10 Gy gamma radiation. Hippocampal brain slices were isolated 30 min, 1 day, 3 days and 5 days after irradiation or sham irradiation and the electrophysiological characteristics of the neural tissue were evaluated. Both radiation doses elicited significant changes that were dependent on dose, dose rate and time. Synaptic efficacy decreased soon after exposure to 5 Gy at dose rates of both 1 and 20 Gy/min. Recovery occurred by 5 days. Ten grays at 20 Gy/min potentiated the postsynaptic potential 1 day after irradiation. By 3 days, synaptic efficacy was decreased and did not recover. The ability of the synaptic potentials to generate spikes was potentiated within 30 min after exposure to 5 Gy at 1 Gy/min and persisted through 3 days, with recovery at 5 days. At the 20 Gy/min dose rate, a similar potentiation did not result with 10 Gy and occurred only at 3 days after irradiation with 5 Gy. Rather, within 30 min and after 5 days, spike generation was significantly depressed by these exposures. Both synaptic efficacy and spike generation contribute to the net input-output relationship of the neuronal population. This relationship was profoundly decreased within 30 min with recovery at 1 day and subsequent decline with the higher dose rate in a dose-dependent manner. These persistent changes in neuronal function are likely to be a consequence of the actions of ionizing radiation on the physiological processes that influence the neuronal environment.",Included
99,"Lower stimulation frequency can enhance tolerability and efficacy of pallidal deep brain stimulation for dystonia We report the case of a patient with medically refractory primary dystonia who was treated with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation. Stimulation at 130 Hz or higher, by means of the more ventral contacts generated capsular side effects, which made their use impractical. Consequently, the patient was treated for 9 months at 130 to 185 Hz, by means of the more dorsal contacts, achieving modest results. By reducing the stimulation frequency to 80 Hz, we were able to activate the ventral contacts without inducing side effects. Within days, the patient experienced a dramatic improvement in function that has persisted for 1 year. A further reduction in stimulation frequency to 60 Hz resulted in a worsening of his symptoms. We conclude that chronic stimulation at frequencies of <100 Hz may be efficacious in dystonia and may enhance the tolerability of stimulation by means of contacts that are positioned posteroventrally within the internal globus pallidus, nearer the internal capsule.",Excluded

The quantification of the retrospective evaluation was carried out by the point-wise dose difference and the gamma-distribution. In this study the gamma-distribution did not appear advantageous over the dose difference for the tolerance range (point-wise dose difference <3%, distance criterion LLL 5 mm). The calculated dose distribution showed large differences (up to 103%) at the boundary of the treatment fields, in the regions of the head contour, and in areas with air inclusions and significant bone structures. The inner parts of the fields, and therefore the actual target volume, revealed only small deviations in the range of -2% in the homogeneous distribution.",Excluded

On the 7th day after irradiation there was statistically significant shortening of the duration of swimming in the control animals. The mentioned doses (statistically significant for the larger dose) were used in nonirradiated animals and the two psychic stimulators also shortened the duration of swimming in comparison with the control nonirradiated animals. This effect could be explained by hyperexcitatory action of these doses of caffeine and methylphenidate. As a result of this, desoptimization of the cerebral activity occurred and as a consequence of which was the diminution of the efficiency of the physical activity. Together with this they observed that both psychic stimulators partially counteracted the shortening of the duration of swimming of rats, caused by ionizing irradiation itself. This effect, especially for caffeine, could be explained by the induced of the ionizing irradiation increase in the sensitivity of cerebral phosphodiesterase of rats to its inhibitor caffeine as a result of which under these conditions the effect of caffeine on the level of cerebral cyclic AMP was reinforced. The cyclic AMP is presumed to have some protective effect against ionizing irradiation.",Included

The target volume of the entorhinoamygdalohippocampectomy area was 4.8-17.1 ml. Marginal dose of 20-25 Gy to the 50% isodose was delivered. One patient was drowned after suffering seizure 7 months after GKRS. Two patients did not show any reduction in seizure frequency over 9 and 18 months. Both patients requested open surgery and became seizure-free postoperatively. Four of the other eight patients were classified as Engel's class I within 4 years after GKRS. One of the four patients experienced symptomatic radiation-induced cerebral edema transiently, one developed radiation necrosis and required surgery 5 years after GKRS, and one developed cognitive impairment with hemiparesis 10 years after GKRS. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed a large cyst in the irradiated temporal lobe. This patient recovered fully after the cyst excision. Only one patient became seizure-free and antiepileptic drug-free without symptomatic radiation-induced complications. However, MR imaging revealed abnormal enhancement, cyst formation, and diffuse white matter change in the irradiated temporal lobe 9 years after GKRS. GKRS for MTLE causes adverse effects of delayed seizure remission and symptomatic radiation-induced complications. Therefore, GKRS cannot be considered as an ideal alternative to surgery for MTLE.

Changes increased with time after the incidence of SCI. TMS revealed reduced excitability and prolonged silent periods for muscles more distant to the deafferented area.CONCLUSIONS: Whereas fMRI demonstrated changes in representation sites adjacent to the deafferented area, TMS excitability changes were also observed more distant to the deafferented area and silent periods were prolonged in comparison to healthy controls. TMS changes might depend on both: the distance to the deafferented area and the time of persistence of deafferentation.",Excluded

However, there are little postoperative data to support the benefits of this strategy. This study evaluated the outcome of CAS in patients who had undergone neck irradiation.METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at 15 vascular surgery or interventional radiology centers in France between January 1998 and July 2006. A total of 135 patients (115 men) with a mean age of 67 +/- 8 years (range, 43-88) underwent CAS for 149 irradiation-induced lesions. The interval between irradiation and discovery of the lesions was 12 +/- 8 years. Mean diameter reduction was 81% (range, 50%-95%), and stenosis was symptomatic in 34%. Contralateral carotid lesions were observed in 48% of patients, including thrombosis in 18 and stenosis >50% in 53.RESULTS: Technical failure occurred during CAS in three cases. The overall technical success rate was 98%. A cerebral protection device was used in 59%. No death, one transient ischemic attack, and two strokes occurred during the first postoperative month. Mean follow-up was 30 months. Six patients were lost to follow-up. Survival rates were 93.9% at 1 year and 75.3% at 3 years. Complications after the first postoperative month included neurologic events in six, carotid thrombosis in nine, and restenosis in 18. The rates of freedom from neurologic and anatomic events were, respectively, 96.2% and 93.2% at 1 year and 93.1% and 85.9% at 3 years.CONCLUSION: The immediate outcome of CAS for irradiation-induced carotid artery stenosis was satisfactory. Medium-term neurologic outcome was acceptable, but the incidence of anatomic events such as thrombosis and restenosis was high. A randomized study is needed to confirm that the outcome of the endovascular and surgical therapy is comparable in this indication.",Excluded

For patients treated with implant alone, the prostate and margin (clinical target volume [CTV]) received a prescription dose of 144 Gy for I-125 or 115 Gy for Pd-103. Two patients received Pd-103 (90 Gy) with 46 Gy supplemental external beam radiation (EBRT). Axial CT images were acquired 2 to 4 hours postoperatively for postimplant dosimetry. Because the NVBs cannot be visualized on CT, NVB calculation points were determined according to previously published anatomic descriptions. Bilateral NVB points were considered to lie posterior-laterally, approximately 2 mm from the prostatic capsule. NVB doses were recorded bilaterally, at 0.5-cm intervals from the prostatic base.RESULTS: For Pd-103, the average NVB doses ranged from 150 Gy to 260 Gy, or 130% to 226% of the prescription dose. For I-125, the average NVB dose ranged from 200 Gy to 325 Gy, or 140% to 225% of the prescription dose. These was no consistent relationship between the NVB dose and the distance from the prostatic base. To examine the possible effect of minor deviations of our calculation points from the true NVB location, we performed NVB calculations at points 2 mm medial or lateral from the NVB calculation point in 8 patients. Doses at these alternate calculation points were comparable, although there was greater variability with small changes in the calculation point if sources were located outside the capsule, near the NVB calculation point. Three patients who developed early postimplant impotence had maximal NVB doses that far exceeded the average values.CONCLUSIONS: In the next few years, we hope to clarify the role of high NVB radiation doses on potency, by correlating NVB dose calculations with a large number of patients enrolled in an ongoing I-125 versus Pd-103 trial for early-stage patients, for whom detailed dosimetric and potency data are being collected prospectively. In the future, we anticipate that NVB doses may be incorporated into dosimetry guidelines to maximize tumor control and minimize treatment-related morbidity.",Excluded

The in vivo screening, consisting of cytotoxicity, phototoxicity (red light) and subcellular localisation studies, revealed two sensitisers (porphyrin 7, molecular weight 863 Da and porphyrin 8, molecular weight 889 Da), which had greater photoactivity than porphyrin C and similar photoactivity to haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) although at a 5-fold higher dose than HpD. Both sensitisers showed intracellular localisation to discrete organelle sites and exhibited considerably less 'dark' cytotoxicity than HpD. The kinetics of uptake of porphyrins 7 and 8 was studied in the mouse C6 glioma model as well as in biopsy samples from normal brain, liver, spleen and blood. Maximal drug uptake levels in tumour occurred 9 and 6 h after intraperitoneal injection for 7 and 8 respectively, at which time the tumour to normal brain ratios were 15:1 and 13:1 respectively. The effect of PDT using porphyrin 7 activated by the gold metal vapour laser tuned to 627.8 nm was studied in Wistar rats bearing intracerebral C6 glioma. At a drug dose of 10 mg porphyrin 7 kg-1 body weight and laser doses of up to 400 J cm-2 light, selective tumour kill with sparing of normal brain was achieved, with a maximal depth of tumour kill of 1.77+/-0.40. mm. Irradiation following a higher drug dose of 75 mg porphyrin 7 kg-1 body weight resulted in a greater depth of tumour kill, but also significantly increased the likelihood and extent of necrosis in normal brain.",Excluded

The PS analysis showed that in non-irradiated animals but supplemented with omega-3 there was a decrease in the power of the beta rhythm, while the DFA applied to different frequency ranges of the ECoG showed a significant increase in the long-range correlation only for the theta wave when compared with non-supplemented animals. In the evaluation of the radiation effect through the PS, an increase in the power of the theta rhythm was observed in both groups (non-supplemented and supplemented animals) only when they were evaluated one week after irradiation. The DFA method also showed difference in this wave. The PS and DFA methods applied to the ECoG record allowed a quantitative analysis of the cortical electrical activity in rats in response to the omega-3 effects, ionizing radiation, or both.",Included

Pain was assessed using a numerical rating scale. Analgesic consumption was recalculated into the daily oral morphine-equivalent dose (OMED). The response criteria of International Bone Metastases Consensus Group (IBMCG) was used. The median follow-up duration was 10 months (range 3-23 months). After SBRT the mean pain score decreased significantly (4.32 before SBRT, 0.71 at 3 months). However, median OMED didn't decrease until 3 months after SBRT (Median OMED; 34.5 mg before SBRT, 45 mg at 3 months). Pain response rate and pain progression-free survival rate at 3 month was 96.8 and 93.5%, respectively. Local progression-free survival rate at 3 month was 93.5%. There was no severe acute toxicity.

3157,"Metabolic correction of cerebral radiation syndrome DNA strand breaks that occur after irradiation activate the repair enzyme adenosine diphosphoribosyl transferase, which consumes NAD as a substrate and causes depletion first of neuronal NAD and then of the ATP pool. This is considered to be the crucial link in the mechanism underlying the cerebral radiation syndrome (CRS). In this study, two ways to correct the CRS metabolically were examined: (a) prevention of depletion of NAD after irradiation by administration of the enzyme inhibitor nicotinamide and (b) shunting the NAD-dependent oxidative phosphorylation pathway of ATP resynthesis by administration of a substrate of NAD-independent oxidation, succinate. Cerebral lesions induced by radiation were modeled by irradiation of rats or rat brain homogenates with 150 Gy of X rays. The manifestations of CRS in rats (excitement, convulsions, etc.) closely resembled those seen after acute hypoxia. In brain homogenates, pyruvate tetrazolium-reductase activity decreased after irradiation and could be corrected by addition of NAD after irradiation. Succinate tetrazolium-reductase activity was not affected by irradiation. Oxygen consumption by brain homogenates after irradiation in vitro and in situ decreased, as did oxygen consumption by rats in vivo after cranio-caudal irradiation. Administration of nicotinamide or succinate prevented both the postirradiation decrease in respiration (in both rats in vivo and brain homogenates in vitro) and the development of cerebral radiation syndrome. These results help to clarify the mechanisms underlying CRS and its metabolic correction.",Included
2436,"CNS bioavailability and radiation protection of normal hippocampal neurogenesis by a lipophilic Mn porphyrin-based superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP<sup>5</sup> Although radiation therapy can be effective against cancer, potential damage to normal tissues limits the amount that can be safely administered. In central nervous system (CNS), radiation damage to normal tissues is presented, in part, as suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired cognitive functions. Mn porphyrin (MnP)-based redox active drugs have demonstrated differential effects on cancer and normal tissues in experimental animals that lead to protection of normal tissues and radio- and chemo-sensitization of cancers. To test the efficacy of MnPs in CNS radioprotection, we first examined the tissue levels of three different MnPs - MnTE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnE), MnTnHex-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnHex), and MnTnBuOE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnBuOE). Nanomolar concentrations of MnHex and MnBuOE were detected in various brain regions after daily subcutaneous administration, and MnBuOE was well tolerated at a daily dose of 3mg/kg. Administration of MnBuOE for one week before cranial irradiation and continued for one week afterwards supported production and long-term survival of newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. MnP-driven S-glutathionylation in cortex and hippocampus showed differential responses to MnP administration and radiation in these two brain regions. A better understanding of how preserved hippocampal neurogenesis correlates with cognitive functions following cranial irradiation will be helpful in designing better MnP-based radioprotection strategies.",Excluded
2452,"Acute brain radiation injury of rabbits: A control study on proton MRS findings and histopathological changes. [Chinese] Objective: To establish radiation induced brain injury rabbit models for observing <sup>1</sup>H-MRS changes and probing on the correlation between MRS findings and histopathological changes. Method(s): Twenty-seven adult New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 9 groups (each n=3). The rabbit brains were irradiated with a single dose of 25 Gy. The observation posts included pre-radiation and 1 to 8 weeks after radiation. Each group underwent single-voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS, after the completion of image acquisition, the animals were sacrificed, and histological specimens were obtained. Pathological changes were analyzed combined with MRS changes. Result(s): The metabolic ratios of choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) increased first and then decreased obviously. Cho/Cr was 1.52 +/- 0.28 pre-radiation, 3.20 +/- 0.72 at 4 weeks, and 2.04 +/- 0.05 at 8 weeks after radiation. The metabolic ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/Cr showed significant decrease tendency, which decreased to 1.28 +/- 0.05 8 weeks after radiation from pre-radiation value of 1.97 +/- 0.25. The metabolic ratios of Cho/NAA showed significant increase after irradiation, which increased to 2.04 +/- 0.78 at 8 weeks after radiation, while the value was 1.19 +/- 0.15 pre-irradiation. After irradiation, vascular changes included telangiectasias and thrombosis, which appeared 2 weeks after irradiation in the histology samples. From 4 weeks after irradiation, ueuron swelling, cytoplasm edema, astrocytosis and microglia hyperplasia could be observed, and demyelination were observed in the white matter and corpus callosum. Conclusion(s): The changes of MRS index are closely related with histopathological findings of acute brain radiation injury of rabbits. MRS can be used as an imaging method for early diagnosis of radiation brain injury. Copyright Â© 2012 by the Press of Chinese Journal of Medical Imaging Technology.",Included
1779,"Re-evaluation of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited-stage small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matched analysis We attempted to re-evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) with more recent data. A total of 179 patients with LS-SCLC received radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy at our institution between 1998 and 2018. One hundred twenty-eight patients who achieved complete response (CR), good partial response (PR), and PR without progression for at least for one year after initial therapy were enrolled in this study. These patients were divided into a PCI group (group A, n=43), and a non-PCI group (group B, n=85). Survival outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. Because several background factors differed significantly between groups A and B, propensity score (PS) matching was performed as 1:1 match of the two groups. Finally, we analyzed 64 patients (group A/B=32/32). Median follow-up periods were 53 and 31 months in groups A and B, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups' backgrounds. Two-year overall survival (OS) rates were 77% in group A and 62% in group B (p=0.224). Two-year brain metastasis free survival (BMFS) rates were 85% in group A and 57% in group B (p=0.008). The number of patients who underwent a brain imaging test for confirmation of no brain metastasis (BM) after radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy (before PCI) was 84 (group A/B=32/52). A PS matched analysis for cases of pre-PCI brain imaging group, two-year OS rates for group A/B were 73/59% (p=0.446). Two-year BMFS rates for group A/B were 91/52% (p=0.021). Retrospectively, PS matched analysis revealed that adding PCI to LS-SCLC patients who achieved good thoracic control significantly improved BMFS, but OS did not improve.

3321,"""Low-intensity laser therapy effect on the recovery of traumatic spinal cord injury"" Scientific advances have been made to optimize the healing process in spinal cord injury. Studies have been developed to obtain effective treatments in controlling the secondary injury that occurs after spinal cord injury, which substantially changes the prognosis. Low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) has been applied in neuroscience due to its anti-inflammatory effects on biological tissue in the repairing process. Few studies have been made associating LILT to the spinal cord injury. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the LILT (GaAlAs laser-780 nm) on the locomotor functional recovery, histomorphometric, and histopathological changes of the spinal cord after moderate traumatic injury in rats (spinal cord injury at T9 and T10). Thirty-one adult Wistar rats were used, which were divided into seven groups: control without surgery (n = 3), control surgery (n = 3), laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5), medullar lesion (n = 5) without phototherapy, medullar lesion + laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), and medullar lesion + laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5). The assessment of the motor function was performed using Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and adapted Sciatic Functional Index (aSFI). The assessment of urinary dysfunction was clinically performed. After 21 days postoperative, the animals were euthanized for histological and histomorphometric analysis of the spinal cord. The results showed faster motor evolution in rats with spinal contusion treated with LILT, maintenance of the effectiveness of the urinary system, and preservation of nerve tissue in the lesion area, with a notorious inflammation control and increased number of nerve cells and connections. In conclusion, positive effects on spinal cord recovery after moderate traumatic spinal cord injury were shown after LILT.",Excluded

Methods to circumvent the BBB have been developed, but none are used in standard clinical practice. The lack of adoption of existing methods is due to procedural invasiveness, serious adverse effects, and the complications associated with performing such techniques coincident with repeated drug administration, which is customary in chemotherapeutic protocols. Pulsed ultrasound, a method for disrupting the BBB, was shown to effectively increase drug concentrations and to slow tumor growth in preclinical studies. We now report the interim results of an ultrasound dose-escalating phase 1/2a clinical trial using an implantable ultrasound device system, SonoCloud, before treatment with carboplatin in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The BBB of each patient was disrupted monthly using pulsed ultrasound in combination with systemically injected microbubbles. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the BBB was disrupted at acoustic pressure levels up to 1.1 megapascals without detectable adverse effects on radiologic (MRI) or clinical examination. Our preliminary findings indicate that repeated opening of the BBB using our pulsed ultrasound system, in combination with systemic microbubble injection, is safe and well tolerated in patients with recurrent GBM and has the potential to optimize chemotherapy delivery in the brain.",Excluded

We evaluated 1127 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) supplemented with 388 putative functional SNPs to capture most of the common variation in 136 DNA repair genes, in five unique case-control series from four different countries (1013 cases, 1016 controls).

282,"The hippocampus in aging and disease: From plasticity to vulnerability The hippocampus has a pivotal role in learning and in the formation and consolidation of memory and is critically involved in the regulation of emotion, fear, anxiety, and stress. Studies of the hippocampus have been central to the study of memory in humans and in recent years, the regional specialization and organization of hippocampal functions have been elucidated in experimental models and in human neurological and psychiatric diseases. The hippocampus has long been considered a classic model for the study of neuroplasticity as many examples of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation and -depression have been identified and demonstrated in hippocampal circuits. Neuroplasticity is the ability to adapt and reorganize the structure or function to internal or external stimuli and occurs at the cellular, population, network or behavioral level and is reflected in the cytological and network architecture as well as in intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons and circuits. The high degree of hippocampal neuroplasticity might, however, be also negatively reflected in the pronounced vulnerability of the hippocampus to deleterious conditions such as ischemia, epilepsy, chronic stress, neurodegeneration and aging targeting hippocampal structure and function and leading to cognitive deficits. Considering this framework of plasticity and vulnerability, we here review basic principles of hippocampal anatomy and neuroplasticity on various levels as well as recent findings regarding the functional organization of the hippocampus in light of the regional vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, epilepsy, neuroinflammation and aging.

2603,"Divergent effects of irradiation on brain cortical morphology in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: one-year follow-up study using structural magnetic resonance imaging Background: Increasing evidence indicates that radiotherapy (RT)-induced brain cortical deficits may play a critical role in developing radiation encephalopathy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the evolutional processes of RT-induced cortical injury have not been sufficiently investigated. This study investigates RT-induced effects on cortical morphology using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in NPC patients.Methods: Using MRI-based morphometry with surface-based measures, we evaluated the longitudinal alterations of cortical volume (CV), cortical thickness (CT), and cortical surface area (CSA) in 104 NPC patients at pre-RT (n=104), within 3 months post-RT (n=92), 6 months post-RT (n=71), and 9-12 months post-RT (n=52). Twenty healthy controls were also evaluated in parallel. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories of RT-related changes in cortical brain morphology and its association with irradiation dose, with healthy controls data being used to construct a normal age-related benchmark. The level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.Results: The results showed that RT-related longitudinal alterations in cortical morphology underwent two diverse patterns during the first year of follow up in NPC patients. The temporal cortices (including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, and the right inferior temporal and right transverse temporal gyrus), the basal occipital cortices (the right lingual gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus), and the basal frontal cortices (the right lateral orbitofrontal gyrus) showed time-dependent attenuation in cortical morphology indices. Furthermore, these effects on multiple cortices were dose-dependent, suggesting they were RT-associated. In contrast, in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus, there was a time-dependent increase in CT.Conclusions: Our preliminary findings revealed divergent effects of irradiation on cortical brain morphology. These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of irradiation-related neurotoxic effects on cortical brain morphology and will help guide the investigation of critically neuroprotective strategies.",Included
1482,"Radiation Induced Metabolic Alterations Associate With Tumor Aggressiveness and Poor Outcome in Glioblastoma Glioblastoma (GBM) is uniformly fatal with a 1-year median survival, despite best available treatment, including radiotherapy (RT). Impacts of prior RT on tumor recurrence are poorly understood but may increase tumor aggressiveness. Metabolic changes have been investigated in radiation-induced brain injury; however, the tumor-promoting effect following prior radiation is lacking. Since RT is vital to GBM management, we quantified tumor-promoting effects of prior RT on patient-derived intracranial GBM xenografts and characterized metabolic alterations associated with the protumorigenic microenvironment. Human xenografts (GBM143) were implanted into nude mice 24 hrs following 20 Gy cranial radiation vs. sham animals. Tumors in pre-radiated mice were more proliferative and more infiltrative, yielding faster mortality (p < 0.0001). Histologic evaluation of tumor associated macrophage/microglia (TAMs) revealed cells with a more fully activated ameboid morphology in pre-radiated animals. Microdialyzates from radiated brain at the margin of tumor infiltration contralateral to the site of implantation were analyzed by unsupervised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In pre-radiated animals, metabolites known to be associated with tumor progression (i.e., modified nucleotides and polyols) were identified. Whole-tissue metabolomic analysis of pre-radiated brain microenvironment for metabolic alterations in a separate cohort of nude mice using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR revealed a significant decrease in levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC)), NAD<sup>+</sup>, Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates, and rise in energy carriers (ATP, GTP). GSH and ASC showed highest Variable Importance on Projection prediction (VIPpred) (1.65) in Orthogonal Partial least square Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA); Ascorbate catabolism was identified by GC-MS. To assess longevity of radiation effects, we compared survival with implantation occurring 2 months vs. 24 hrs following radiation, finding worse survival in animals implanted at 2 months. These radiation-induced alterations are consistent with a chronic disease-like microenvironment characterized by reduced levels of antioxidants and NAD<sup>+</sup>, and elevated extracellular ATP and GTP serving as chemoattractants, promoting cell motility and vesicular secretion with decreased levels of GSH and ASC exacerbating oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest IR induces tumor-permissive changes in the microenvironment with metabolomic alterations that may facilitate tumor aggressiveness with important implications for recurrent glioblastoma. Harnessing these metabolomic insights may provide opportunities to attenuate RT-associated aggressiveness of recurrent GBM.",Excluded

1338,"Electrically evoked GABA release in rat hippocampus CA1 region and its changes during kindling epileptogenesis Previous findings on changes in K+-induced GABA release from hippocampal slices during kindling epileptogenesis were reinvestigated using physiological electrical stimulation. For that purpose, a procedure was developed enabling neurochemical monitoring of GABA release locally in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices upon tetanic stimulation of Schaffer-collateral fibers. In the presence of a GABA reuptake blocker, subsequent application of short (3 s) pulses of 50-Hz stimuli induced a local transient increase in GABA release. In slices from fully kindled animals, 24 h after the last generalized seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release was increased in comparison to control slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, 4-5 weeks after the last seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release had returned to control levels. Application of the broad low-affinity GABAB receptor antagonist saclofen increased the tetanically stimulated GABA release in control slices, but had no effect in fully kindled slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, however, saclofen enhanced GABA release similarly as in control slices. We conclude that the transient increase in tetanus-induced GABA release during kindling epileptogenesis is seizure-related, and probably caused by temporarily impaired presynaptic GABAB receptors. The possible relevance of this finding for GABA transmission in epilepsy is discussed.",Excluded
1632,"Changes in intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in adult rat S1 during cortical reorganization Peripheral denervation causes significant changes in the organization of developing or adult primary somatosensory cortex (S1). However, the basic mechanisms that underlie reorganization are not well understood. Most attention has been focused on possible synaptic mechanisms associated with reorganization. However, another important determinant of cortical circuit function is the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons in the circuit. Here we document changes in the intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in cortical layer 2/3 in adult rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) after varying durations of forepaw denervation. Denervation of the forepaw induced a rapid and sustained shift in the location of the border between the forepaw and lower jaw representations of adult S1 (reorganization). Coronal slices from the reorganized region were maintained in vitro and the intrinsic properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of S1 were determined using whole cell recordings. In general, passive membrane properties were not affected by denervation; however, a variety of active properties were. The most robust changes were increases in the amplitudes of the fast and medium afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and an increase in the interval between action potentials (APs). Additional changes at some durations of denervation were observed for the AP threshold. These observations indicate that changes in intrinsic properties, mostly reflecting a decrease in overall excitation, may play a role in changes in cortical circuit properties during reorganization in adult S1, and suggest a possible role for AHPs in some of those changes.",Excluded

Pre-treatment of mice with dexamethasone, in a schedule which suppressed acute-phase gene expression after brain irradiation, did not significantly change c-fos and junB induction. Our results show that c-fos and junB responses occur in the brain in response to irradiation and that they can be modified by pentobarbital treatment but suggest that there is no direct correlation between the level of mRNA expression and later expression of cytokines or other acute-phase response genes.",Included
45,"Reduced pineal melatonin biosynthesis in fractionally irradiated rats The effects of ionizing radiation on pineal melatonin and on key enzymes of its metabolism have been studied in our laboratory. After adaptation to an artificial light/dark cycle of 12:12 h, male Wistar rats were fractionally whole-body irradiated with a dose of 2.4 Gy of gamma-rays twice a week up to total doses of 4.8, 9.6 or 14.4 Gy. Irradiation and sham-irradiation were performed in the late afternoon. The rats were sacrificed at 24:00 to 01:00 h in darkness, 6 h, 3 or 5 days after the last exposure. Pineal and serum melatonin concentrations, pineal activities of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and of monoamine oxidase (MAO) were determined. The NAT activities in the rats irradiated with 4.8 and 9.6 Gy decreased at some intervals without changes of melatonin concentration. Irradiation with a total dose of 14.4 Gy decreased NAT activity and the concentration of pineal and serum melatonin 6 h and 3 days after the last exposure. The activity of MAO, estimated only in the rats irradiated with the dose of 14.4 Gy, increased significantly 3 days after irradiation. The fractionated irradiation up to the dose of 14.4 Gy caused a transient decrease in pineal melatonin synthesis. This could be the consequence of preferential oxidative deamination of serotonin in comparison with its N-acetylation, leading to melatonin biosynthesis.",Included
771,"Radiation dose analysis of large and giant internal carotid artery aneurysm treatment with the pipeline embolization device versus traditional coiling techniques BACKGROUND: Flow diversion is an effective and increasingly accepted method for endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Additionally, the public has heightened concerns regarding radiation exposure from medical procedures. This study analyzes radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during treatment of large and giant proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms with the pipeline embolization device (PED) versus traditional coiling techniques.METHODS: Radiation dose, fluoroscopy time, and contrast dye administration were retrospectively analyzed in 55 patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aneurysms >= 10 mm from petrous to superior hypophyseal ICA segments. Patients were treated by either PED (37 patients) or traditional coiling techniques (18 patients). Aortic arch type and proximal ICA tortuosity were also assessed as markers of access difficulty.RESULTS: Average radiation dose with PED treatment was 2840 +/- 213 mGy and 4010 +/- 708 mGy with traditional coiling techniques (p=0.048; 29% decrease with PED). Mean fluoroscopy time for PED was 56.1 +/- 5.0 min and 85.9 +/- 11.9 min for coiling cases (p=0.0087; 35% decrease with PED). These benefits existed despite more difficult arch anatomy and a trend towards greater proximal vessel tortuosity in PED cases. Contrast dye amounts were also reduced by 37.5% in PED cases (75 +/- 6 mL) versus coiling cases (120 +/- 13 mL, p=0.0008).CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of large and giant proximal ICA aneurysms using PED requires less radiation, less fluoroscopy time, and less contrast administration than standard coiling techniques. This further demonstrates the benefits of flow diversion for treatment of these aneurysms.",Excluded

These results emphasise the necessity to carry out further investigations on the interaction of this type of electromagnetic fields and the human organism.",Excluded
3543,"Morphologic comparisons between rhodopsin-mediated and short-wavelength classes of retinal light damage The histologic manifestations of rhodopsin-mediated versus short-wavelength classes of retinal phototoxicity were compared after spectral exposures of the albino rat retina. Animals were exposed to wave-bands of light centered at the peak of rhodopsin absorbance (green, 500 nm) or in the ultraviolet A (UVA; 360 nm). Intensity-damage curves generated for each wave-band indicated that UVA light was 50-80 times more effective than green light at causing photoreceptor cell losses. Examination of early ultrastructural changes in rod inner segments, outer segments, and retinal pigment epithelium revealed a remarkable degree of similarity between UVA and green light-induced damage. Furthermore, the two classes of damage were indistinguishable in terms of post-exposure recovery from threshold damage and regional distribution of photoreceptor cell loss along the vertical meridian. The finding of essentially identical histologic manifestations for the two classes of damage raises the possibility that they share a common biochemical etiology or pathway of cell destruction.",Excluded

In 61% of them neurocirculatory dystonia was found, 39% of patients revealed dyscirculatory encephalopathy. Alongside with dystonic disorders structural changes of vessels were detected. Asthenoneurosis diagnosed in 97% of patients was recognized as a key syndrome in 53%, while in 23%--obsessional-phobic syndrome dominated, in 7%--depressive syndrome and in 14%--psycho-organic syndrome were at the foreground. Somatic status in most patients (67%) was burdened by diseases of digestive tract. 191 patients revealed considerable immune imbalance. In 95 patients (33%) it was less pronounced and consisted in moderate decrease of TPR/TPS ratio. Degrees of immune and neurological disorders correlated closely. The conclusion was made that low-dose radiation induces primary damage of immunity and vessels with secondary nervous system involvement. That is why connection between neurological symptoms and radiation in subjects who took part in liquidation of Chernobyl accident aftermath may be considered probable only in association with immune and circulatory disorders.",Included
3438,"Gene expression in rat vestibular and reticular structures during and after space flight Space flight produces profound changes of neuronal activity in the mammalian vestibular and reticular systems, affecting postural and motor functions. These changes are compensated over time by plastic alterations in the brain. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful indicators of both activity changes and neuronal plasticity. We studied the expression of two IEG protein products [Fos and Fos-related antigens (FRAs)] with different cell persistence times (hours and days, respectively) to identify brainstem vestibular and reticular structures involved in adaptation to microgravity and readaptation to 1 G (gravity) during the NASA Neurolab Mission (STS-90). IEG protein expression in flight animals was compared to that of ground controls using Fisher 344 rats killed 1 and 12 days after launch and 1 and 14 days after landing. An increase in the number of Fos-protein-positive cells in vestibular (especially medial and spinal) regions was observed 1 day after launch and 1 day after landing. Fos-positive cell numbers were no different from controls 12 days after launch or 14 days after landing. No G-related changes in IEG expression were observed in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pattern of FRA protein expression was generally similar to that of Fos, except at 1 day after landing, when FRA-expressing cells were observed throughout the whole spinal vestibular nucleus, but only in the caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus. Fos expression was found throughout the entire medial vestibular nucleus at this time. While both Fos and FRA expression patterns may reflect the increased G force experienced during take-off and landing, the Fos pattern may additionally reflect recent rebound episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep following forced wakefulness, especially after landing. Pontine activity sources producing rhythmic discharges of vestibulo-oculomotor neurons during REM sleep could substitute for labyrinthine signals after exposure to microgravity, contributing to activity-related plastic changes leading to G readaptation. Reticular structures exhibited a contrasting pattern of changes in the numbers of Fos- and FRA-positive cells suggestive of a major influence from proprioceptive inputs, and plastic re-weighting of inputs after landing. Asymmetric induction of Fos and FRAs observed in some vestibular nuclei 1 day after landing suggests that activity asymmetries between bilateral otolith organs, their primary labyrinthine afferents, and vestibular nuclei may become unmasked during flight.",Included

3378,"Fractional anisotropy dose-response relationship of the corpus callosum Purpose or Objective: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive modality for determination of water diffusion properties. Fractional anisotropy (FA) quantifies the extent of directionality of water diffusion. We investigated absorbed dose as a predictor of FA change in the corpus callosum (CC) following radiation therapy for high grade glioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with high-grade glioma underwent DTI scans before, and ten months after radiation therapy to 59.4-60 Gy. Diffusion data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Using an automated white matter fiber tracking technique, 23 fiber tracts were segmented on the baseline and follow-up DTI images. The CT images used for treatment planning and both DTI image sets were aligned using non-linear registration. This way, the baseline FA, the follow-up FA, and the absorbed dose could be determined for each voxel in all 15 patients. For each voxel in the CC, we calculated the FA change as FA follow-up /FA baseline and dichotomized the data into a binary outcome variable using 0.5 as cutoff. For all 15 patients, logistic regression was used to determine dose-response curve parameters (D50 and g50) and their confidence intervals (CIs). We used the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) to evaluate the discriminative ability of the voxel dose. Then, we estimated dose-response curve parameters and calculated the AUC for each patient individually. Result(s): The median age was 59 (range: 40-85) years. The average CC volume and average CC mean absorbed dose was 62+/-8 cm3 and 26+/-14 Gy (1 SD), respectively. Using data from 99 691 voxels, the estimated parameters for the doseresponse curve for all patients (upper panel in Figure 1) were D50=88.0+/-0.1 Gy and gamma50=0.80+/-0.01 (95% CIs). The AUC was 0.71 indicating good discriminative ability. For nine out of 15 patients, the individual AUC was >=0.60, indicating that higher absorbed dose is associated with higher probability of FA change >=0.5. Dose -response curves for those patients are shown in the lower panel in Figure 1 and their estimated parameter values in Table 1. Individual D50s varied between 41.3 and 125.9 Gy. Conclusion(s): Absorbed dose was a significant predictor of FA change in the CC. This was the case both when all patients were pooled for analysis, and in nine out of 15 patients when analyzed separately. More detailed analyses are needed to better understand the effect radiation has on water diffusion in brain white matter. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

2784,"Efficient production of high specific activity 64Cu using a biomedical cyclotron Copper-64 (T 1/2 = 12.7 h) is an intermediate-lived positron-emitting radionuclide that is a useful radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) as well as a promising radiotherapy agent for the treatment for cancer. Currently, copper-64 suitable for biomedical studies is produced in the fast neutron flux trap (irradiation of zinc with fast neutrons) at the Missouri University Research Reactor. Access to the fast neutron flux trap is only possible on a weekly basis, making the availability of this tracer very limited. In order to significantly increase the availability of this intermediate-lived radiotracer, we have investigated and developed a method for the efficient production of high specific activity Cu-64 using a small biomedical cyclotron. It has been suggested that it may be possible to produce Cu-64 on a small biomedical cyclotron utilizing the 64Ni(p,n)64Cu nuclear reaction. We have irradiated both natural nickel and enriched (95% and 98%) Ni-64 plated on gold disks. Nickel has been electroplated successfully at thicknesses of approximately 20-300 mm and bombarded with proton currents of 15-45 microA. A special water-cooled target had been designed to facilitate the irradiations on a biomedical cyclotron up to 60 microA. We have shown that it is possible to separate Cu-64 from Ni-64 and other reaction byproducts rapidly and efficiently by using ion exchange chromatography. Production runs using 19-55 mg of 95% enriched Ni-64 have yielded 150-600 mCi of Cu-64 (2.3-5.0 mCi/microAh) with specific activities of 94-310 mci/microgram Cu. The cyclotron produced Cu-64 had been used to radiolabel PTSM [pyruvaldehyde bis-(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone), used to quantify myocardial, cerebral, renal, and tumor blood flow], MAb 1A3 [monoclonal antibody MAb to colon cancer], and octreotide. A recycling technique for the costly Ni-64 target material has been developed. This technique allows the nickel eluted off the column to be recovered and reused in the electroplating of new targets with an overall efficiency of greater than 90%.",Excluded

Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with recurrent or progressive gliomas received re-irradiation between 1996 and 2011. The median age of the patients was 43 years (range, 20-63 years). Pathologic subtypes were glioblastomas in 21 patients (58.3%), WHO grade III astrocytomas in 8 patients (22.2%), and WHO grade I/II astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas in 7 patients (19.4%). In 27 patients, re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas was preceded by subtotal (19/36; 52.8%) or total (8/36; 22.2%) tumor resection. The median time interval between initial radiation therapy (RT) and re-irradiation was 30.5 months (range, 4-173 months). Radiation doses of the first and second radiation course were 32.4-70.0 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) and 30.0-64.6 Gy (median 45 Gy). The cumulative radiation doses were 82.8-123.0 Gy (median 100.2 Gy), and the median cumulative biological equivalent doses (BED) were 195.8 (a/b = 2 Gy) and 102.3 Gy (a/b = 10 Gy). All patients were followed-up until death or the time of analysis. Result(s): Thirty-two patients died of disease 2-50 months after re-irradiation and one patient was alive with disease 12 months after re-irradiation. Three patients are alive without disease 8-50 months after re-irradiation. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.5 months (range, 2-50 months), and the 6 and 12months OS rates were 83.3 and 39.4%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.5 months, and 6-months and 12-months PFS rates were 71.09 and 41.7%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <=70 (p<0.001), the dose of re-irradiation <=40 Gy(p = 0.019), and the length of time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation(p = 0.029) were associated with improvement in OS. In multivariate analysis, KPS (p=0.033) was the most important predictors for OS. Histologic subtype (GBM vs non-GBM, median OS, 8 vs 12 months, p=0.668) and surgical resection (median OS, 9 vs 12 months, p = 0.810) had no significant benefit on OS. Radiographically suspected radiation necrosis (RN) after re-irradiation was seen in 6 patients (16.7%) whose median cumulative radiation doses were 100.4 Gy, and a median cumulative BED were 198.4 Gy (a/b=2 Gy). At 3, 7 and 8 months after re-irradiation, neurological deterioration occurred in 3 patients, and was managed with dexamethasone and anticonvulsant drug. Conclusion(s): Approximately 45 Gy of re-irradiation after 60 Gy of initial radiation therapy was feasible without serious complications. Re-irradiation could be suggested as an alternative salvage treatment for selected recurrent glioma patients with good performance status and recurrence over a longer period of time.",Excluded

The volume of the box has been chosen corresponding to the volume of a small rat and illuminated by a 3G mobile phone frequency (1718.5 MHz), and the emitted radiation directed toward brain phantom. The induced fields in the phantom material are measured. Set up to lift the plane carrying the mobile phone is run by a pulley whose motion is controlled by a stepper motor. The platform is made to move at a pre-determined rate of 2degree per min limited up to 20degree. The measured data for induced fields in various locations are used to compute corresponding SAR values and inter comparison obtained. These data are also compared with those when the mobile phone is placed horizontally with respect to the position of the animal. The SAR data is also experimentally obtained by measuring a rise in temperature due to this mobile exposures and data compared with those obtained in the previous set. To seek a comparison with the safety criteria same set of measurements are performed in 10 g phantom material contained in a cubical box. These results are higher than those obtained with the knowledge of induced field measurements.

1251,"Circadian clock protein BMAL1 regulates melanogenesis through MITF The circadian clock is near ubiquitous, self-sustaining, and oscillates with a periodic cycle of about 24 hr. The skin circadian clock is known to be involved in various important cellular pathways including cell cycle, nucleotide excision repair, and metabolism by regulating the expression of specific target genes known as the clock-controlled genes (CCGs). In this study, we show that Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), an essential rate-limiting protein in melanin biosynthesis, is a transcriptional target of the circadian clock. Using primary human melanocytes, human melanoma cells and mouse skin tissues, we have established transcriptional regulation of MITF by the circadian clock, which translates into rhythmic 24 hr expression of MITF mRNA and protein levels. We also show that the circadian clock protein Brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (BMAL1) is a positive regulator of MITF, which causes an increase in melanin levels. Further, we demonstrate that upon exposure to solar UV-B radiation in presence of BMAL1, there is reduced gammaH2AX and cleaved PARP level compared to BMAL1 deficient group, which contributes to enhanced cell viability and survival. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the novel regulation of MITF by BMAL1 provides better protection against solar UV-B mediated genomic instability and melanomagenesis.",Excluded
2829,"Using biologically based objectives to optimize boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy planning for brainstem tumors in dogs Irradiated brain tumors commonly progress at the primary site, generating interest in focal dose escalation. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to use biological optimization objectives for a modeling exercise with simultaneously-integrated boost IMRT (SIB-IMRT) to generate a dose-escalated protocol with acceptable late radiation toxicity risk estimate and improve tumor control for brainstem tumors in dogs safely. We re-planned 20 dog brainstem tumor datasets with SIB-IMRT, prescribing 20 x 2.81 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and 20 x 2.5 Gy to the planning target volume. During the optimization process, we used biologically equivalent generalized equivalent uniform doses (gEUD) as planning aids. These were derived from human data, calculated to adhere to normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) <=5%, and converted to the herein used fractionation schedule. We extracted the absolute organ at risk dose-volume histograms to calculate NTCP of each individual plan. For planning optimization, gEUD<sub>(a = 4) </sub> = 39.8 Gy for brain and gEUD<sub>(a = 6.3) </sub> = 43.8 Gy for brainstem were applied. Mean brain NTCP was low with 0.43% (SD +/-0.49%, range 0.01-2.04%); mean brainstem NTCP was higher with 7.18% (SD +/-4.29%, range 2.87-20.72%). Nevertheless, NTCP of < 10% in brainstem was achievable in 80% (16/20) of dogs. Spearman's correlation between relative GTV and NTCP was high (rho = 0.798, P < .001), emphasizing increased risk with relative size even with subvolume-boost. Including biologically based gEUD values into optimization allowed estimating NTCP during the planning process. In conclusion, gEUD-based SIB-IMRT planning resulted in dose-escalated treatment plans with acceptable risk estimate of NTCP < 10% in the majority of dogs with brainstem tumors. Risk was correlated with relative tumor size.",Excluded

The aim of this retrospective study was to show the validity of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication model for thyroid gland based on clinical results.METHODS: Thyroid function was evaluated by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine serum levels before radiation therapy, 3 months after the beginning of radiation therapy, and afterwards at each follow-up visit. Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Dose-volume histogram, total dose, fractionation schedule, total duration of the treatment, and other parameters were used for normal tissue complication probability calculation based on the LKB model. The model was evaluated after fitting with the three sets of parameters for grade 2 hypothyroidism: 1) ""Emami,"" where n= 0.22; m= 0.26, and D<sub>50</sub>= 80Gy; 2) ""mean dose,"" where n= 1; m= 0.27, and D<sub>50</sub>= 60Gy; and 3) ""Lyman EUD,"" where n= 0.49; m= 0.24, and D<sub>50</sub>= 60Gy.

Median follow-up was 1.2 years. Cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism grade 2 or higher after 12 and 24 months was 9.6 and 22.0%, respectively. Normal tissue complication probability values calculated with mean dose and Lyman EUD parameters showed the best correlation with our clinical findings.CONCLUSION: Empirically based modelling of normal tissue complication probability was valid for our cohort of patients. With carefully chosen parameters, the LKB model can be used for predicting the normal tissue complication probability value.",Excluded

3003,"Sparing of cochleae and eyes in whole brain radiation therapy with boost by helical tomotherapy and noncoplanar VMAT Purpose/Objective: Simple low conformity lateral opposing radiation beams with limited sparing to proximal organs-atrisk (OARs) were widely adopted in the past for treating palliative whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Crucial OARs located at skull base used to sacrifice with significant radiation dose inevitably. More conformal radiation treatments, like helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), are becoming more accepted to treat WBRT. These techniques allow not only conformal dose to the whole brain but also simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) doses to dedicated metastases for superior disease control and symptom relief. This study aimed to investigate any potential advantages in cochleae and eyes sparing between HT and non-coplanar VMAT. Material(s) and Method(s): Treatment planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 15 brain metastasis patients who had received palliative dose WBRTs with SIBs to the metastases in the department were recruited. Each patient was re-planned with HT and non-coplanar VMAT for dosimetric comparison. Departmental routine optimal settings with fan beam thickness of 2.5cm and pitch value of 0.287 were used in all HT plans. One coplanar full arc plus two non-coplanar half arcs modulating by Varian Millennium 120 MLCs were used in all VMAT plans. The two non-coplanar half arcs were arranged at 60 degrees offset to each other and to the coplanar full arc to cover the cranial hemisphere. All target volumes were optimized according to original prescriptions. The median whole brain dose was 30Gy (range 25-40Gy) and the median SIB dose was 35Gy (range 30-45Gy). The mean SIB volume was 26.7+/-30.4cc consisting 1.7+/-1.8% of the whole brain volume 1481.8+/-161.1cc. Radiation doses to cochleae and eyes were studied by comparing their maximum doses (Dmax) and mean doses (Dmean). The dose results from the two techniques were tested statistically by paired t-test considering significant level of p-value <0.05. Result(s): The dose results are listed in Table 1. Non-coplanar VMAT significantly achieved lower Dmax and Dmean to both cochleae than HT (all p<0.001). Radiation doses to both eyes were slightly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT but could not be shown statistically significant (all p>0.05). However, the Dmax and Dmean to both lens were significantly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion(s): Non-coplanar VMAT is superior to HT in sparing cochleae which are relatively small and highly proximal to target volumes. There is no significant dose difference in eyes sparing for both techniques. Non-coplanar VMAT is preferred to treat WBRT with SIB if slight increase in lens doses is not a concern.

788,"Brain irradiation leads to persistent neuroinflammation and long-term neurocognitive dysfunction in a region-specific manner Long-term cognitive deficits are observed after treatment of brain tumors or metastases by radiotherapy. Treatment optimization thus requires a better understanding of the effects of radiotherapy on specific brain regions, according to their sensitivity and interconnectivity. In the present study, behavioral tests supported by immunohistology and magnetic resonance imaging provided a consistent picture of the persistent neurocognitive decline and neuroinflammation after the onset of irradiation-induced necrosis in the right primary somatosensory cortex of Fischer rats. Necrosis surrounded by neovascularization was first detected 54 days after irradiation and then spread to 110 days in the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory region, striatum and right ventricle, resulting in fiber bundle disruption and demyelination in the corpus callosum of the right hemisphere. These structural damages translated into selective behavioral changes including spatial memory loss, disinhibition of anxiety-like behaviors, hyperactivity and pain hypersensitivity, but no significant alteration in motor coordination and grip strength abilities. Concomitantly, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, accompanied by infiltration of leukocytes (CD45+) and T-cells (CD3+) cooperated to shape the neuroinflammation response. Overall, our study suggests that the slow and gradual onset of cellular damage would allow adaptation in brain regions that are susceptible to neuronal plasticity; while other cerebral structures that do not have this capacity would be more affected. The planning of radiotherapy, adjusted to the sensitivity and adaptability of brain structures, could therefore preserve certain neurocognitive functions; while higher doses of radiation could be delivered to brain areas that can better adapt to this treatment. In addition, strategies to block early post-radiation events need to be explored to prevent the development of long-term cognitive dysfunction.",Included

Nevertheless, tissue specificity of bystander responses within the same organism has not been examined in detail. Studies on in vivo bystander effect conducted so far analyzed changes induced by single-dose exposure. The potential of fractionated irradiation to induce bystander effects in vivo has never been studied. We analyzed changes in global DNA methylation and microRNAome in skin and spleen of animals subjected to single-dose (acute or fractionated) whole-body or cranial exposure to 0.5 Gy of X-rays. We found that IR-induced DNA methylation changes in bystander spleen and skin were distinct. Acute radiation exposure resulted in a significant loss of global DNA methylation in the exposed and bystander spleen 6 hr, 96 hr, and 14 days after irradiation. Fractionated irradiation led to hypomethylation in bystander spleen 6 hr after whole-body exposure, and 6 hr, 96 hr, and 14 days after cranial irradiation. Contrarily, changes in the skin of the same animals were seen only 6 hr after acute whole-body and head exposure. DNA hypomethylation observed in spleen was paralleled by a reduction of methyl-binding protein MeCP2 expression. Irradiation also induced tissue-specific microRNAome alterations in skin and spleen. For the first time, we have shown that IR-induced epigenetic bystander effects that occur in the same organism are triggered by both acute and fractionated exposure and are very distinct in different bystander organs.

This study evaluates bowel function and related quality of life in patients 2 - 4 years after hemicolectomy, comparing the results to healthy controls. Methods Eligible patients were identified from prospectively maintained colorectal databases at two teaching hospitals. Patients were recruited during regular follow up visits or by telephone interview. Patient relatives with an intact colon were recruited as controls. Study exclusion criteria were poor cognitive ability, inflammatory bowel disease, metastatic disease, previous pelvic radiation, prior colonic, stomach or small bowel resection, bypass surgery, vagotomy, an existing stoma and anal incontinence. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) questionnaire was used to assess bowel function and the EQ-5D questionnaire to assess quality of life (QOL). Parametric and non-parametric tests were used with log transformation and regression methods for skewed data. Association between EQ-5D and MSKCC scores was examined with Spearman's rank correlation. Results A total of 85 patients (mean age 69 +/- 11.2 years) and 85 controls (mean age 58.2 +/- 13.4 years) were recruited in 12 months. Patients reported a significantly higher number of bowel movements per day than controls (2 versus 1, P < 0.001). Initial analysis suggested that patients had a significantly lower total MSKCC score (group difference mean -3.1, CI -5.8 to -0.4, p = 0.02), indicating worse bowel function in the patient group. Following adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, differences in total score were no longer significant, but the patient group had a lower score for the frequency subscale and the ability to control flatus (p = 0.008 and p = < 0.001). MSKCC frequency scores were worse after right-sided resections (p = 0.03). High scores for complete emptying and the differentiation between wind and solid had a positive correlation with better QOL (p = 0.007 and 0.02 respectively). There was a nonsignificant decrease in the overall QOL (EQ-5D p = 0.6, EQ-VAS p = 0.12) following hemicolectomy compared with controls. Conclusion Colonic resection has an adverse effect on bowel frequency with worse outcomes following right hemicolectomy.

[Russian] The radiation reaction of the mouse brain microvascular system was investigated 15 months after chronic (dose-rate was 3 cGy/day) and acute (dose-rate 3.2 Gy/min) gamma-irradiation. Late pathological changes in the microvascular system after the acute irradiation (3 Gy) were not found. In the same time, after chronic irradiation with equivalent dose (the accumulated dose was 3 Gy) the depletion of endothelial cell population, and multiple foci of minor pathological changes of endotheliocyte ultrastructure at as many as 50% of the population were revealed. It may be more likely to lead to reduction of tolerance of brain microvascular system to an acute radiation (10 Gy) in the late period after chronic exposure. The mechanism of impairment of brain microcirculation after low chronic irradiation will have to understand.",Included

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was completed twice, with a 1-yr interval. This questionnaire was also completed by an age- and sex-matched normative population (N = 580). Detailed data on treatment were extracted from the cancer registry and Population-based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies (PHAROS).RESULTS: Of the 181 patients who were invited, 148 responded (82%, T1). Patients treated with immunochemotherapy reported clinically relevant higher mean fatigue scores than those who underwent radiotherapy (P = 0.02). No differences were observed on the other HRQoL scales between treatment groups. Mean HRQoL scores were worse for FL patients treated with immunochemotherapy compared with a normative population (P < 0.01). A quarter to 50% of patients persistently reported to be slowed down, lethargic, or persistently worried about future health or was limited in social activities. Subsequently, patients reporting these symptoms/worries had a lower global health status/HRQoL.CONCLUSION: Alertness for persistent symptoms that occur during and after treatment of FL patients is needed and may help to avoid lasting negative influence on their HRQoL.",Excluded

Right MCAs were treated with 25 Gy and 50 Gy at the 50% isodose line, while contralateral vessels received 15 Gy and 20 Gy at the 20% isodose region. Survival period varied from 3 to 18 months. Reduction in contractile capacity of irradiated normal rat MCAs was detected but their lumina remained patent. In another study, we investigated human AVM tissue cultures in order to detect genetic and phenotypic modifications contributing to vessel occlusion after irradiation. In culture, the proliferation index decreased considerably following 15-, 20-, 25- or 50-Gy irradiation at the 5th posttreatment day and remained depressed during the observation period of 14 days. P53, p21Waf-1 and mdm-2 mRNA contents were elevated significantly after irradiation, indicating enhanced apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed vigorous vimentin positivity in the nonirradiated control AVM cultures, which gradually decreased by the time in the irradiated specimens. Smooth muscle alpha-actin positivity was prominent in the irradiated cultivated samples, suggesting transformation of resting fibroblasts onto activated myofibroblastic elements with contractile capacity. This transformation process was confirmed by the appearance of TGF-Beta in the irradiated AVM cell lines also. These data support the hypothesis that one of the contributing factors to AVM shrinkage and obliteration after radiosurgery might be fibrocyte-myofibroblastic cell transformation in the vessel wall.",Included

Patients and Methods: 33 patients with brain metastases were included in the study and treated with TMZ 60 mg/m2/day (days 1-16) concomitantly with WBI (36 Gy/12 fractions given in 16 days). One month after the end of radiotherapy, 6 cycles of TMZ were administered as adjuvant treatment (200 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days). Result(s): Responses were assessed using computed tomography at the end of the 3rd and 6th cycle of chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 54.5% and 57.6% after the 3rd and the 6th cycle, respectively. The median overall survival was 12 months. In patients with metastases from lung cancer the objective response rate was 11/14 (78.6%) after both the 3rd and the 6th cycle of treatment. The most common side effects were anemia (24.2%), thrombocytopenia (18.2%), as well as nausea and vomiting (18.2%). The high incidence of hepatotoxicity (45.5%) might be related to concomitantly administered antiepileptic drugs and not to TMZ. Conclusion(s): WBI combined with TMZ as concomitant and adjuvant treatment is effective in treating brain metastases, with acceptable mild side effects. Â© 2007 S. Karger GmbH.",Excluded

1734,"Spinal cord compression in prostate cancer: treatment outcome and prognostic factors BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord compression (SCC) is an important complication of metastatic prostate cancer. We have analysed patients treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital to assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors in this patients group.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of 69 patients with spinal cord compression and prostate cancer treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital.RESULTS: At presentation 40 (58%) patients were non-ambulant and 52% were catheterised. Diagnosis was established by myelography in 42% and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 47% of patients. MRI detected significantly more patients with multiple sites of compression (51 versus 7%, P < 0.001). SCC was present at the initial diagnosis of prostatic cancer in 13 patients and 17 patients had received no hormone treatment prior to diagnosis. Following treatment 36 (52%) patients had a functional improvement of motor power with 25/40 (63%) non-ambulant patients becoming ambulant. Seventy-seven percent of patients who had eventual improvement had some improvement in power within 7 days. On multivariate analysis a single level of compression, no previous hormone therapy and a young age (<65 years) predicted for better outcome. When these factors were included an increased radiation dose (>30 Gy) or the addition of surgery did not improve the functional outcome. Following initial recovery; there was a 45% risk of developing a further episode of cord compression at the same or new site by 2 years with a median time to progression of 236 days (range 47-1215 days). The median survival was 115 days (range 5-2016 days) with 25% of patients surviving for 2 years. Patients with no prior hormone therapy had a median survival of 627 days (range 46-1516 days). Other predictors of improved survival on multivariate analysis were a single site of compression and a haemoglobin over 12 g.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of SCC in prostate cancer results in improved motor function in the majority of patients. Long-term survival is possible, especially in good performance status patients with no prior hormone treatment. Survivors remain at high risk of subsequent neurological relapse. An early improvement in motor power is a strong predictor of subsequent functional improvement. MRI detects additional sites of asymptomatic SCC which makes it the investigation of choice.",Excluded
63,"Effect of short-duration spaceflight on thigh and leg muscle volume PURPOSE: Human skeletal muscle probably atrophies as a result of spaceflight, but few studies have examined this issue. Thus, little is known about the influence of microgravity upon human skeletal muscle, nor is it possible to assess the validity of ground based models of spaceflight. This study tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of spaceflight induced muscle atrophy would be a function of flight duration and greater than that of bed rest.METHODS: Three astronauts flew 9, 15, and 16 d in space. Volume of the knee extensor (quadriceps femoris), knee flexor (hamstrings, sartorius, and gracilis), and plantar flexor (triceps surae) muscle groups was measured using magnetic resonance imaging before and after spaceflight and during recovery. The volume of each muscle group in each image was determined by multiplying cross-sectional area by slice thickness. These values were subsequently summed to calculate muscle volume.RESULTS: Volume changes in the knee extensor, knee flexor, and plantar flexor muscle groups ranged from -15.4 to -5.5, -14.1 to -5.6, and -8.8 to -15.9%, respectively. Muscle volume decreases normalized by flight duration ranged from 0.62 to 1.04% x d(-1). These relative changes appeared to be greater than those that we have reported previously for bed rest (Akima et al., J. Gravitat. Physiol. 4:15-22, 1997).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that atrophy as a result of at least 2 wk of spaceflight varied among individuals and muscle groups and that the degree of atrophy appeared to be greater than that induced by 20 d of bed rest.",Excluded
1419,"Radiotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastases: effects of activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations on clinical response PURPOSE: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been applied to inoperable brain metastases in lung adenocarcinoma. Recently, an in vitro study showed reduced clonogenic survival of mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) lung cancer cell lines in response to ionizing radiation compared with that of the wild type. To elucidate the role of EGFR mutations in radiation treatment, we evaluated the clinical response to WBRT and survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastases.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of 63 patients with brain metastases from lung adenocarcinoma who were treated with WBRT. Demographic data, EGFR mutation status, response to WBRT, and survival data were collected. Clinical response was assessed 1 month after the start of WBRT. Univariate and logistic regression models were used to test potential predictive factors associated with clinical response. Log-rank test and Cox regression were analyzed to identify factors that affected survival.RESULTS: Clinical response to WBRT was observed in 29 patients (46%), with 34 nonresponder patients (54%). Patients with EGFR mutations had higher response rates to WBRT compared with those with the wild-type (54% versus 24%; P = 0.045). Both the administration of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (P = 0.034) and EGFR mutation (P = 0.029) were independently associated with response to WBRT. In Cox regression analysis, WBRT responder (P = 0.010) and absence of extracranial metastases (P = 0.002) were associated with better survival.CONCLUSIONS: Both the EGFR mutations and the administration of EGFR TKI during WBRT were independent predictors of response to WBRT in brain metastases of lung adenocarcinoma.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: Between July 1, 1984 and January 1, 1991, 144 patients with diagnosis of ocular melanoma were treated with high activity I-125 episcleral plaques. Tumor volumes ranged from 14 to 3449 mm<sup>3</sup>. Lesion size included small (n = 15; height < 5 mm, and/or largest basal diameter of 8-16 mm) and large (n = 45; height > 8 mm, and/or largest basal diameter > 16 mm). Apical doses ranged from 74.25 to 83.66 Gy with scleral doses ranging from 41 and 160 Gy. Follow-up has ranged from 25 to 90 months (Med = 46 months). Result(s): Ocular survival was noted in 130/144. Reasons for enucleation included progressive tumor growth (n = 4), extrascleral extension (n = 4), or blind/painful eye (n = 6), 94 patients developed complications which included cataract (n = 43), optic neuropathy (n = 12), neovascular glaucoma (n = 8) and retinopathies (n = 31).

1648,"Gel-based proteomics of unilateral irradiated striatum after gamma knife surgery Gamma knife surgery (GKS) is used for the treatment of various brain disorders. The biological effects of focal gamma ray irradiation on targeted or surrounding areas in the brain are not well-known. In the present study, we evaluated protein expression changes in the unilateral irradiated (60 Gy) striatum in rat. Striata of irradiated and control brains were dissected 16 h post-irradiation for analysis by large-format two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE). In parallel, we also examined the un-targeted contralateral striatum over the control for potential changes in proteins patterns that may have occurred due to the effects of irradiation to the unilateral striatum. A total of 17 reproducible and differentially expressed silver nitrate-stained protein spots in the irradiated striatum was detected on 2-D gel. Their subsequent analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-LC-MS/MS) resulted in the identification of 13 nonredundant proteins. Interestingly, out of these 13 changed proteins, 2 proteins were also detected in the contralateral striatum. Some of the significantly changed proteins identified were creatine kinase, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (PDA3), and peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2). Western analysis with anti-PDA3 and anti-Prx2 antibodies revealed 4 and 2 cross-reacting protein spots on 2-D gel blots. Interestingly, after GKS, in the irradiated and un-irradiated striata, these spots showed a shift toward the acidic side, suggesting post-translational modifications. Taken together, these results indicate that unilateral irradiation during GKS triggers molecular changes in the bilateral striata.",Included

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 15 patients plans and 79 DCA generated in iPlan (BrainLAB, AG, Germany) with a mean equivalent MLC field size of 16.6 mm (range 7.5-32.7mm) were tested. Plans were delivered on a Novalis TX, using the 6XSRS energy mode with a D/R of 1000 MU/min and a HDMLC multileaf collimator (2.5 mm leaf size at isocenter). Using a Lucy 3D QA Phantom (Standard Imaging, Inc., USA), dose distributions were recalculated for each plan and the absolute isocenter dose was checked for each treatment field in the phantom, both with a DD (PTW 60003 Diamond Detector PTW, Freiburg, Germany) and with a PSD (Exradin W1 scintillator, Standard Imaging, Inc., USA). The detectors were positioned in the same way in the phantom, each with its specific insert, both with their longitudinal axis parallel the radiation beam when the gantry is at zero angle (see figure). This position was used to acquire the CT images of the phantom, define the isocenter location and the setup measurements. The figure shows also that the DD creates artifacts in the CT scan caused by the metallic connectors of the detector which lead to dose under-dosage estimation for table position 0degree (the artifact represents a region of density higher than the acrylic material of the phantom which at table position zero falls on the beam path with a consequent larger than real radiation absorption and therefore lowers the dose calculated at isocenter). This effect is not present for the PSD. The DD, because of its small detector volume, is being used as our gold standard for fixed dose rates treatments. Furthermore our DD presents a well centered sensitive detector volume, as measured on X-ray images, of about 0.002 cc against 0.0024 cc of the PSD. Result(s): The mean dose ratio (measured/expected) over all arcs for the DD and PSD was 1.020 (SD 0.035) and 1.020 (SD 0.025) respectively. Excluding DCA with table rotations at 0degree (5 arcs) the mean dose ratio was 1.014 (SD 0.022) and 1.021 (SD 0.026) respectively for the DD and PSD. The mean ratio PSD/DD of the dose readings distribution over all arcs and excluding zero table positions was 1.001 (SD 0.026) and 1.006 (SD 0.014) respectively. Conclusion(s): The Exradin W1 Scintillator seems to be suitable for pretreatment QA of typical clinical MLC based stereotactic radio surgery plans, with equivalent MLC field sizes starting from 7.5 mm. Furthermore, the Exradin W1 Scintillator because of its water equivalence does not cause any dose perturbations. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

In this study, the effects of (56)Fe irradiation on hippocampal function were assessed starting 2 weeks after whole-body irradiation. Compared to sham irradiation, radiation impaired novel object recognition in female and male C57BL/6J wild-type mice. There were no effects of irradiation on contextual fear conditioning or spatial memory retention in the water maze. It is possible that oxidative damage might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive changes. Therefore, hippocampal and cortical levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and lipid peroxidation, measures of oxidative damage were assessed. There were no effects of irradiation on these measures of oxidative damage. As (56)Fe irradiation can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which may contribute to the impairments in novel object recognition, the effects of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on cognition following sham irradiation and irradiation were also assessed. ALA did not prevent radiation-induced impairments in novel object recognition and impaired spatial memory retention of sham-irradiated and irradiated mice in the probe trial after the first day of hidden platform training in the water maze. Thus, the novel object recognition test is particularly sensitive to detect early cognitive effects of (56)Fe irradiation through a mechanism unlikely involving ROS or oxidative damage.",Included

1038,"Respiratory modulation of human autonomic function on Earth KEY POINTS: We studied healthy supine astronauts on Earth with electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial pressure, respiratory carbon dioxide concentrations, breathing depth and sympathetic nerve recordings. The null hypotheses were that heart beat interval fluctuations at usual breathing frequencies are baroreflex mediated, that they persist during apnoea, and that autonomic responses to apnoea result from changes of chemoreceptor, baroreceptor or lung stretch receptor inputs. R-R interval fluctuations at usual breathing frequencies are unlikely to be baroreflex mediated, and disappear during apnoea. The subjects' responses to apnoea could not be attributed to changes of central chemoreceptor activity (hypocapnia prevailed); altered arterial baroreceptor input (vagal baroreflex gain declined and muscle sympathetic nerve burst areas, frequencies and probabilities increased, even as arterial pressure climbed to new levels); or altered pulmonary stretch receptor activity (major breathing frequency and tidal volume changes did not alter vagal tone or sympathetic activity). Apnoea responses of healthy subjects may result from changes of central respiratory motoneurone activity.ABSTRACT: We studied eight healthy, supine astronauts on Earth, who followed a simple protocol: they breathed at fixed or random frequencies, hyperventilated and then stopped breathing, as a means to modulate and expose to view important, but obscure central neurophysiological mechanisms. Our recordings included the electrocardiogram, finger photoplethysmographic arterial pressure, tidal volume, respiratory carbon dioxide concentrations and peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity. Arterial pressure, vagal tone and muscle sympathetic outflow were comparable during spontaneous and controlled-frequency breathing. Compared with spontaneous, 0.1 and 0.05 Hz breathing, however, breathing at usual frequencies (~0.25 Hz) lowered arterial baroreflex gain, and provoked smaller arterial pressure and R-R interval fluctuations, which were separated by intervals that were likely to be too short and variable to be attributed to baroreflex physiology. R-R interval fluctuations at usual breathing frequencies disappear during apnoea, and thus cannot provide evidence for the existence of a central respiratory oscillation. Apnoea sets in motion a continuous and ever changing reorganization of the relations among stimulatory and inhibitory inputs and autonomic outputs, which, in our study, could not be attributed to altered chemoreceptor, baroreceptor, or pulmonary stretch receptor activity. We suggest that responses of healthy subjects to apnoea are driven importantly, and possibly prepotently, by changes of central respiratory motoneurone activity.

In the flow rats, the absolute mass of postural muscles remained unchanged while their relative mass increased; this may be attributed to their enhanced hydration which developed during the first 2 days after landing. Strength losses of the postural muscles were less significant than after previous flights.

1476,"H2O2-Sensitive Isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1 Act in Bitter-Sensing Gustatory Neurons to Promote Avoidance of UV During Egg-Laying The evolutionarily conserved TRPA1 channel can sense various stimuli including temperatures and chemical irritants. Recent results have suggested that specific isoforms of Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1) are UV-sensitive and that their UV sensitivity is due to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. However, whether such UV sensitivity served any physiological purposes in animal behavior was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms promote avoidance of UV when adult Drosophila females are selecting sites for egg-laying. First, we show that blind/visionless females are still capable of sensing and avoiding UV during egg-laying when intensity of UV is high yet within the range of natural sunlight. Second, we show that such vision-independent UV avoidance is mediated by a group of bitter-sensing neurons on the proboscis that express H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms. We show that these bitter-sensing neurons exhibit dTRPA1-dependent UV sensitivity. Importantly, inhibiting activities of these bitter-sensing neurons, reducing their dTRPA1 expression, or reducing their H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity all significantly reduced blind females' UV avoidance, whereas selectively restoring a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive isoform of dTRPA1 in these neurons restored UV avoidance. Lastly, we show that specifically expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson in these bitter-sensing neurons promotes egg-laying avoidance of red light, an otherwise neutral cue for egg-laying females. Together, these results demonstrate a physiological role of the UV-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms, reveal that adult Drosophila possess at least two sensory systems for detecting UV, and uncover an unexpected role of bitter-sensing taste neurons in UV sensing.",Excluded

2631,"Solution X-ray scattering evidence for agonist- and antagonist-induced modulation of cleft closure in a glutamate receptor ligand-binding domain Agonist-induced conformational changes in the ligand-binding domains (LBD) of glutamate receptor ion channels provide the driving force for molecular rearrangements that mediate channel opening and subsequent desensitization. The resulting regulated transmembrane ion fluxes form the basis for most excitatory neuronal signaling in the brain. Crystallographic analysis of the GluR2 LBD core has revealed a ligand-binding cleft located between two lobes. Channel antagonists stabilize an open cleft, whereas agonists stabilize a closed cleft. The crystal structure of the apo form is similar to the antagonist-bound, open state. To understand the conformational behavior of the LBD in the absence of crystal lattice constraints, and thus better to appreciate the thermodynamic constraints on ligand binding, we have undertaken a solution x-ray scattering study using two different constructs encoding either the core or an extended LBD. In agreement with the GluR2 crystal structures, the LBD is more compact in the presence of agonist than it is in the presence of antagonist. However, the time-averaged conformation of the ligand-free core in solution is intermediate between the open, antagonist-bound state and the closed, agonist-bound state, suggesting a conformational equilibrium. Addition of peptide moieties that connect the core domain to the other functional domains in each channel subunit appears to constrain the conformational equilibrium in favor of the open state.",Excluded

We have previously published a new method to derive pCT images from head T1-weighted (T1-w) MR images using a single-atlas propagation scheme followed by a post hoc correction of the mapped CT numbers using local intensity information. The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of our method with head zero echo time (ZTE) MR images. To evaluate results, the mean absolute error in bins of 20 HU was calculated with respect to the true planning CT scan of the patient. We demonstrated that applying our method using ZTE MR images instead of T1-w improved the correctness of the pCT in case of bone resection surgery prior to RT (that is, an example of large anatomical difference between the atlas and the patient).",Excluded

We examined bone marrow cells of Tg mice and their normal (Nr) siblings for three markers of DNA damage and assessed the impact of free radical stress using ionizing radiation. We also evaluated the radiation protection afforded by a dietary supplement that we previously demonstrated to extend longevity and reduce cognitive ageing of Nr and Tg mice. Spectral karyotyping revealed few spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in Nr or Tg. Tg mice, however, had significantly greater constitutive levels of both gammaH2AX and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) compared to Nr. When exposed to a 2-Gy whole-body dose of ionizing radiation, both Nr and Tg mice showed significant increases in DNA damage. Compared to Nr mice, irradiated Tg mice had dramatically higher levels of gammaH2AX foci and double the levels of chromosomal aberrations. In unirradiated mice, the dietary supplement significantly reduced constitutive gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in both Nr and Tg mice (normalizing both gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in Tg), with little difference in gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG over constitutive levels. Induced chromosomal aberrations were also reduced, and in Nr mice, virtually absent. Remarkably, supplemented mice expressed 6-fold lower levels of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations compared to unsupplemented Nr or Tg mice. Based on our data, the dietary supplement appeared to scavenge free radicals before they could cause damage. This study validates Tg mice as an exemplary model of oxidative stress and radiation hypersensitivity and documents unprecedented radioprotection by a dietary supplement comprised of ingredients available to the general public.",Included

Saline (control) or DFMO (150 mg/kg/day) was infused for 18 days starting 2 days before irradiation. At varying times up to 8 weeks after irradiation, brain tissues were collected and the cell responses in and around the focal lesion were quantified. Immunohistochemical stains were used to label astrocytes (GFAP), vascular endothelial cells (Factor VIII), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs; MAC 387) and cells synthesizing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (BrdU). Cellular responses were quantified using a histomorphometric analysis.RESULTS: After radiation alone, cellular events included a substantial acute inflammatory response followed by increased BrdU labeling and progressive increases in numbers of capillaries and astrocytes. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine treatment significantly affected the measured cell responses. As in controls, an early inflammatory response was measured, but after 2 weeks there were more PMNs/unit area than in controls. The onset of measurable BrdU labeling was delayed in DFMO-treated animals, and the magnitude of labeling was significantly reduced. Increases in astrocyte and vessel numbers/mm2 were observed after a 2-week delay. At the site of implant, astrocytes from DFMO-treated dogs were significantly smaller than those from controls.CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial cell proliferation and infiltration in response to interstitial irradiation of normal brain, and these responses are significantly altered by DFMO treatment. Although the precise mechanisms by which DFMO exerts its effects in this model are not known, the results from this study suggest that modification of radiation injury may be possible by manipulating the response of normal cells to injury.",Included

While systemic injection of the radioprotectant S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721) did not block hyperthermia induced by exposure to 10 Gy of gamma radiation, central administration did attenuate it. The dephosphorylated metabolite of WR-2721, N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,3-diaminopropane (WR-1065), accentuated radiation-induced hypothermia by both routes of administration. In brain homogenates, oxygen uptake was inhibited by WR-2721 but elevated by WR-1065. These results suggest that the antagonism of radiation-induced hypothermia found only after central administration of WR-2721 is due to its direct actions and not to its dephosphorylated metabolite and that this effect may be correlated with the inhibition by WR-2721 of oxygen uptake.",Included

Of the 279 patients, 263 had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment (16 had no evidence of gross residual disease), 141 had tumors of a major salivary gland, and 138 had tumors of minor salivary glands. The median follow-up period was 36 months (range, 1-142 months).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local-regional control, cause-specific survival, and freedom from metastasis.RESULTS: The 6-year actuarial cause-specific survival rate was 67%. Multivariate analysis revealed that low group stage (I-II) disease, minor salivary sites, lack of skull base invasion, and primary disease were associated with a statistically significant improvement in cause-specific survival. The 6-year actuarial local-regional control rate was 59%. Multivariate analysis revealed size 4 cm or smaller, lack of base of skull invasion, prior surgical resection, and no previous radiotherapy to have a statistically significant improved local-regional control. Sixteen patients without evidence of gross residual disease had a 100% 6-year actuarial local-regional control. The 6-year actuarial freedom from metastasis rate was 64%. Factors associated with decreased development of systemic metastases included negative lymph nodes at the time of treatment and lack of base of skull involvement. The 6-year actuarial rate of development of grade 3 or 4 long-term toxicity (using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research on the Treatment of Cancer criteria) was 10%. No patient experienced grade 5 toxic effects.CONCLUSIONS: Neuron radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with salivary gland neoplasms who have gross residual disease and achieves excellent local-regional control in patients without evidence of gross disease.",Excluded

In the epithermal reactor beams used for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for treatment of brain tumors, fission neutrons are a contaminating component. To estimate the radiosensitivity of the O-2A progenitors for fission neutrons, an in vivo-in vitro clonogenic assay was used. Radiosensitivity of progenitors obtained from the spinal cord of 1- or 5-day-old rats or the optic nerve of 2- or 12-week-old rats for 1 MeV fission neutrons was compared to that for 300 kVp X rays. Dose-survival curves were fitted according to the linear-quadratic model. The resulting beta component was very small to negligible. Progenitor cells obtained from rats of different ages show differences in radiosensitivity, characterized by different alpha values. RBE values for fission neutrons were 3.5 for 1-day-old spinal cord, 3.2 for 5-day-old spinal cord, 3.0 for 2-week-old optic nerve, and 4.3 for 12-week-old optic nerve.

1209,"Stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife radiosurgery of cystic brain metastasis Object. Treatment options for patients with brain metastasis include tumor resection, whole-brain radiation therapy, and radiosurgery. A single treatment is not useful in cases of multiple tumors, of which at least 1 is a cystic tumor. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in the treatment of cystic brain metastasis. Methods. Between January 2001 and November 2005, 680 consecutive patients with brain metastases underwent GKS at our hospital, 30 of whom were included in this study (18 males and 12 females, mean age 60.6 +/- 11 years, range 38-75 years). Inclusion criteria were: 1) no prior whole-brain radiation therapy or resection procedure; 2) a maximum of 4 lesions on preoperative MR imaging; 3) at least 1 cystic lesion; 4) a Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 70; and 5) histological diagnosis of a malignant tumor. Results. Non-small cell lung carcinoma was the primary cancer in most patients (19 patients [63.3%]). A single metastasis was present in 13 patients (43.3%). There was a total of 81 tumors, 33 of which were cystic. Ten patients (33.3%) were in recursive partitioning analysis Class I, and 20 (66.6%) were in Class II. Before drainage the mean tumor volume was 21.8 ml (range 3.8-68 ml); before GKS the mean tumor volume was 10.1 ml (range 1.2-32 ml). The mean prescription dose to the tumor margin was 19.5 Gy (range 12-25 Gy). Overall median patient survival was 15 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 54.7% (95% confidence interval 45.3-64.1%) and 34.2% (95% confidence interval 23.1-45.3%). Local tumor control was achieved in 91.3% of the patients.

2709,"Acute and subacute myelopathy Myelopathy is a term referring to any pathologic process affecting the spinal cord, and encompasses a broad spectrum of etiologies. The first step is to categorize myelopathy, according to the time to reach maximum deficit. Myelopathies are commonly classified as acute, subacute or chronic, for which the etiologies are totally different. Myelopathy is considered acute when the symptoms progress to their nadir in maximum 21 days after onset. Due to heterogeneity in pathogenesis, and the overlap in the clinical and imaging presentation among etiologies, acute myelopathy is considered as a diagnostic dilemma. A simple and efficient algorithm for timely identification of the underlying cause is thus useful. In this review, we provide a simplified approach for the differential diagnosis among all causes of acute myelopathies, and describe the principal clinical and imaging features of the main etiologies in adults, including recently characterized antibody-mediated myelitis, and its mimics.

The purpose of our experiments was to examine the possible influence of the hypothalamus in supporting cellular proliferation, and thus adenoma growth. Fragments from four human pituitary adenomas (three pituitary prolactinomas; one ACTH-secreting adenoma) were transplanted into the pituitary fossa of total-body irradiated, hypophysectomized rats. The rats were killed after two weeks and perfused with a mixture of formalin and India ink. Histologic examination of serial sagittal sections through the pituitary fossa and the adjacent brain showed: vascularization of the grafts from the pituitary stalk and from the scar tissue in the sphenoid bone; survival of some adenomas; and numerous mitoses in an ACTH-secreting specimen obtained from a patient who had Cushing's disease.

To date, no mechanism to explain these findings has been identified. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether acute magnetic-field exposure could elicit DNA damage within brain cells from both whole brain and cerebellar homogenates from adult rats, adult mice and immature mice. Rodents were exposed to a 60 Hz magnetic field (0, 0.1, 1 or 2 mT) for 2 h. Then, at 0, 2 and 4 h after exposure, animals were killed humanely, their brains were rapidly removed and homogenized, and cells were cast into agarose gels for processing by the alkaline comet assay. Four parameters (tail ratio, tail moment, comet length and tail length) were used to assess DNA damage for each comet. For each species, a significant increase in DNA damage was detected by each of the four parameters in the positive control (2 Gy X rays) relative to the concurrent nonirradiated negative and sham controls. However, none of the four parameters detected a significant increase in DNA damage in brain cell homogenates from any magnetic-field exposure (0- 2 mT) at any time after exposure. The dose-response and time-course data from the multiple animal groups tested in this study provide no evidence of magnetic-field-induced DNA damage.",Excluded

3507,"Thymoquinone induces cell killing in glioblastoma cells through generation of DNA damage and cell cycle arrest Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common type of brain tumor in humans. Surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy is the current standard treatment; however, due to the upregulation of several survival pathways, tumor recurrence is quite common with a median survival of 12 to 15 months. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of glioblastoma. Naturally occurring phytochemicals have steadily received much scientific attention, owing to the fact that many of these compounds have potent action against tumors. Thymoquinone (TQ) is the bioactive compound of the volatile oil extracted from the black seed, Nigella sativa. TQ has shown anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic actions with a selective cytotoxicity for human cancer cells compared to several normal cells. Here, we show that TQ is able to dose-dependently inhibit colony formation in three distinct glioblastoma cell lines (T98, U87 and Gli36), with the highly tumorigenic Gli36 being the most sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of TQ. We also show that TQ induces persistent -H2AX activation, a marker of DNA double strand breaks, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TQ also causes G2/M cell cycle arrest in GBM cells to a degree that correlates with the cells' relative clonogenic sensitivity. Moreover, co-treatment with TQ and N-acetyl cysteine, a simple thiol nucleophile and antioxidant, prevented cell death, DNA double strand breaks, and cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that TQ is a potent inhibitor of GBM cell proliferation and growth, and that this effect may be mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species.",Excluded
2019,"Systemic HDAC3 inhibition ameliorates impairments in synaptic plasticity caused by simulated galactic cosmic radiation exposure in male mice Deep space travel presents a number of measurable risks including exposure to a spectrum of radiations of varying qualities, termed galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) that are capable of penetrating the spacecraft, traversing through the body and impacting brain function. Using rodents, studies have reported that exposure to simulated GCR leads to cognitive impairments associated with changes in hippocampus function that can persist as long as one-year post exposure with no sign of recovery. Whether memory can be updated to incorporate new information in mice exposed to GCR is unknown. Further, mechanisms underlying long lasting impairments in cognitive function as a result of GCR exposure have yet to be defined. Here, we examined whether whole body exposure to simulated GCR using 6 ions and doses of 5 or 30 cGy interfered with the ability to update an existing memory or impact hippocampal synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism believed to underlie memory processes, by examining long term potentiation (LTP) in acute hippocampal slices from middle aged male mice 3.5-5 months after radiation exposure. Using a modified version of the hippocampus-dependent object location memory task developed by our lab termed ""Objects in Updated Locations"" (OUL) task we find that GCR exposure impaired hippocampus-dependent memory updating and hippocampal LTP 3.5-5 months after exposure. Further, we find that impairments in LTP are reversed through one-time systemic subcutaneous injection of the histone deacetylase 3 inhibitor RGFP 966 (10 mg/kg), suggesting that long lasting impairments in cognitive function may be mediated at least in part, through epigenetic mechanisms.",Included
807,"Measuring inflammation in brains of NFL players using [11c]DPA-713 PET Background: Former National Football League (NFL) players have higher rates of delayed neurological, cognitive and affective impairments. Those impairments have been attributed to pathologic effects of repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI), characterized by shearing of neuronal axons and inflammatory response. We recently showed that [11C]DPA-713 PET-based neuroimaging (DPA-PET) is a promising tool to quantify increased expression of translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of brain injury and repair, in former NFL players. Here we sought to use DPA-PET in active and recently retired NFL players to test for changes in binding to TSPO. Method(s): We quantified regional distribution (VT) of TSPO using DPA-PET in the brains of a novel set of nine active and recently retired NFL players and eight age-matched, athletic, healthy controls. Diffusion tensor imaging was also completed to evaluate white matter changes in the brains of these individuals. Result(s): Using two-way ANOVA with cohort (NFL players, controls) and TSPO genotype as fixed factors, DPA-PET VT values were signiflcantly increased in several brain regions in NFL players compared to controls, particularly in thalamus and brainstem. We also found signiflcantly diminished fractional anisotrophy in the right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR) and signiflcantly increased mean diffusivity (MD) in bilateral PTRs. Conclusion(s): Findings from this pilot study of young NFL players support a model wherein microglial activation is an early, persistent response in select brain structures after rmTBI.

2166,"Persistent calcium current in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons The suprachiasmatic nuclei contain the primary circadian clock, and suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons exhibit a diurnal modulation of spontaneous firing rate. The present study examined the voltage-gated persistent Ca(2+) current, in acutely isolated rat suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons using a ramp-type voltage-clamp protocol. Slow triangular voltage-clamp commands from a holding potential of -85 mV to +5 mV elicited inward current (100-400 pA) that was completely blocked by Cd(2+). This current showed little or no hysteresis, and was identified as persistent Ca(2+) current. The threshold for persistent Ca(2+) current ranged between -60 and -45 mV, and it was maximal at about -8 mV. Nifedipine at 10-20 microM blocked 80-100%. To assess the role of persistent Ca(2+) current in the generation of spontaneous action potentials in both acutely isolated and intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons, the effect of Cd(2+) and nifedipine on firing rate was studied using on-cell recording. Application of Cd(2+) exerted a weak excitatory effect and nifedipine had no significant effect on the spontaneous firing rate of isolated suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. In all intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations (n=15), Cd(2+) slowly inhibited spontaneous firing; in high-frequency firing cells (four of 15), a transient increase of firing rate preceded inhibition. No significant effect of nifedipine on firing rate of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons was found. Therefore, persistent Ca(2+) current itself (as carrier of charge) does not appear to contribute significantly to spontaneous firing of suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. A slowly developing inhibitory effect of Cd(2+) on spontaneous firing of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations may be due to penetration of Cd(2+) through Ca(2+) channels, and its subsequent effect on intracellular mechanisms, while the transient increase of firing rate in high-frequency firing neurons is probably due to inhibition of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current.",Excluded

Immediately after exposure, night-time sleep was polysomnographically recorded for 8 h. Sleep architecture was not affected by EMF exposure. Analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a dose-dependent increase of power in the spindle frequency range in non-REM sleep. Reaction speed decelerated with increasing field intensity in the 1-back task, while accuracy in the CRT and N-back task were not affected in a dose-dependent manner.

To verify the proposed method, we train and test the CNN using axially averaged data of existing thin-slice CT images as input and their middle slice as the label. Fifty-two CT studies are used as the CNN training set, and 13 CT studies are used as the test set. We perform five-fold cross-validation to confirm the performance consistency.

We assess the performance of the proposed method with respect to the resolution and contrast, as well as the noise properties. The CNN generates output images that are virtually equivalent to the ground truth. The most remarkable image-recovery improvement by the CNN is deblurring of boundaries of bone structures and air cavities. The CNN output yields an approximately 10% higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and lower normalized root mean square error than the input (thicker slices). The CNN output noise level is lower than the ground truth and equivalent to the iterative image reconstruction result.

21,"Clinical outcome after fractionated radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma Purpose/Objective(s): Pituitary tumors are relatively uncommon. Primary goals of treatment include normalization of hormonal level and improving visual or neurological symptoms. Surgery, medical treatment, irradiation, or combination of these modalities is used to achieve these goals. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the clinical outcome of pituitary adenoma treated with fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of pituitary adenoma treated at our center between 2006 and 2014. A total of 88 patients with biopsy-proven adenomas were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (18-79 years) and 49 patients (56%) were males. Majority of tumors were marcoadenoma (87%). Presenting symptoms were mainly hormonal disturbance in 43 patients (49%), visual defects in 29 patients (33%) and headache in 21 patients (23%). Prolactinomas were the most common secretory adenoma in 22 patients (51%), followed by growth hormone secreting adenomas in 15 patients (35%) and ACTH-secreting tumors in 5 patients (12%), while one patient had TSH-secreting adenoma. The cohort follow up time reached 87 months (mean; 32 months). The primary endpoints are clinical and biochemical control. Result(s): Thirteen patients lost to follow up, therefore 75 patients were included in the final analysis. Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 70 patients (93%).While medical treatment was used for inoperable or hormonal secreting adenoma in 30 patients (40%). Fractionated radiation therapy was delivered to 28 patients (37%), indications for radiation were symptomatic, incompletely resected tumors (16 patients) or persistent hypersecretion (12 patients). For secretory tumors the median radiation dose was 52Gy (50-54Gy), and lower dose was delivered for non-secretory adenoma; mean 50Gy (45-52Gy). For patients received radiation therapy, the tumor control rate is 75% for non-functioning adenomas, and 69% for functioning adenomas. Conclusion(s): Pituitary adenoma is a slow growing benign tumor; however devastating effect can result from neurological deficits or hormonal imbalance. Our results reveal that functioning adenomas carry worse prognosis. Fractionated radiation therapy, as an adjunct to surgery and medical treatment, offers good clinical and biochemical control for pituitary adenoma.

Immediate amputations were performed in 7/27 patients. 15/27 patients were subjected to radiation therapy (preoperative in 6/15 cases), 8/27 patients received chemotherapy (5/8 preoperatively). Result(s): Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 y was 63.0% and 59.5%. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. 8/27 patients developed metastatic disease after 28.9 +/- 9.8 months. Survival (p = 0.397) and disease-free survival (p = 0.113) did not differ in patients after amputations vs limb salvage. Application of radiation therapy was associated with a better survival (p = 0.003). Complications related to the surgical intervention were recorded in 2/27 patients, complications related to radiation therapy occurred in 6/15 patients.

981,"Osteoradionecrosis of the cervical spine resulting from radiotherapy for primary head and neck malignancies: operative and nonoperative management. Case report Osteoradionecrosis is a process of dysvascular bone necrosis and fibrous replacement following exposure to high doses of radiation. The poorly vascularized necrotic tissue may cause pain and/or instability, and it cannot resist infection well, which may result in secondary osteomyelitis. When these processes affect the cervical spine, the resulting instability and neurological deficits can be devastating, and immediate reestablishment of spinal stability is paramount. Reconstruction of the cervical spine can be particularly challenging in this subgroup of patients in whom the spine is poorly vascularized after radical surgery, high-dose irradiation, and infection. The authors report three cases of cervical spine osteoradionecrosis following radiotherapy for primary head and neck malignancies. Two patients suffered secondary osteomyelitis, severe spinal deformity, and spinal cord compression. These patients underwent surgery in which a vascularized fibular graft and instrumentation were used to reconstruct the cervical spine; subsequently hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy was instituted. Fusion occurred, spinal stability was restored, and neurological dysfunction resolved at the 2- and 4-year follow-up examinations, respectively. The third patient experienced pain and dysphagia but did not have osteomyelitis, spinal instability, or neurological deficits. He underwent HBO therapy alone, with improved symptoms and imaging findings. Hyperbaric oxygen is an essential part of treatment for osteoradionecrosis and may be sufficient by itself for uncomplicated cases, but surgery is required for patients with spinal instability, spinal cord compression, and/or infection. A vascularized fibular bone graft is a very helpful adjunct in these patients because it adds little morbidity and may increase the rate of spinal fusion.",Excluded

The results show that structural changes in the subglottic glands occur concomitantly with an increased expression of certain neuropeptides in the innervation of these glands, which implies a relationship between these two parameters. The mast cells respond drastically to irradiation, but in the long run, regeneration of these cells occurs.",Included
1964,"Dose-response curves and tolerance doses for late functional changes in the normal rat brain after stereotactic radiosurgery evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging: influence of end points and follow-up time Late reaction of normal tissue is still a limiting factor in radiotherapy and radiosurgery of patients with brain tumors. Few quantitative data in terms of dose-response curves are available. In the present study, 99 animals were irradiated stereotactically at the right frontal lobe using a linear accelerator and single doses between 26 and 50 Gy. The diameter of the spherical dose distribution was 4.7 mm (80% isodose). Dose-response curves for late changes in the normal brain at 20 months were measured using T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The dependence of the dose-response curves on the follow-up time and the definition of the biological end point were determined. Tolerance doses were calculated at several effect probability levels and times after irradiation. The MRI changes were found to be dependent on dose and progressive in time. At 20 months, the tolerance doses at a 50% effect probability level were 39.6 +/- 1.0 Gy and 42.4 +/- 1.4 Gy for changes in T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. These dose-response curves can be used for further quantitative investigations on the influence of various treatment parameters, such as the application of charged particles, radiopharmaceuticals or the variation of tissue oxygenation.",Included
108,"A prospective, phase II study demonstrating the potential value and limitation of radiosurgery for spine metastases PURPOSE: To evaluate toxicity, efficacy, feasibility, and target volume dosimetry of single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy or radiosurgery for spine tumors.METHODS: Twenty-five patients were treated on a prospective phase II protocol of single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy or radiosurgery for tumors near the spinal cord (N = 21). Patients received 15 Gy, given a spinal cord limit of 12 Gy to 0.1 mL for patients with no prior spine radiotherapy (N = 9), and 5 Gy to 0.5 mL for patients with prior spine radiotherapy (N = 12). The primary endpoint was toxicity. The secondary endpoint was efficacy measured with a pain scale, 2 neurologic function scales, and magnetic resonance scans. Minor endpoints were feasibility and dose coverage.RESULTS: Acute toxicity was grade 1 to 2 dysphagia or nausea. There were no late toxicities. Three patients experienced radiographic evidence of vertebral body compression in field; 2 were asymptomatic and 1 was managed with vertebroplasty. One patient progressed at the radiosurgery site (local control, 95%); 43% experienced pain relief. Most patients died or developed progressive systemic disease soon after radiosurgery. One-year progression-free survival was 5% with 60% of patients dead by 1 year. Patients with the site of radiosurgery as their only site of disease also did poorly: 2-year progression-free survival = 10% with half dead of cancer within 2 years. There were no problems planning and delivering spine radiosurgery with a 60-minute treatment slot. In patients with and without prior radiotherapy, we achieved our target-coverage goal in 91% and 95%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is an excellent option for patients with symptomatic spine metastases in previously irradiated areas. In patients without previous irradiation, the biology of metastatic cancer limits spine radiosurgery's ability to improve outcome.",Excluded
916,"Ionizing radiation induces structural and functional damage on the molecules of rat brain homogenate membranes: a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic study Humans can be exposed to ionizing radiation, due to various reasons, whose structural effects on biological membranes are not well defined. The current study aims to understand the ionizing radiation-induced structural and functional alterations in biomolecules of brain membranes using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy using rat animal models. For this purpose, 1000 cGy of ionizing radiation was specifically directed to the head of Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were decapitated after 24 h. The results revealed that the lipid-to-protein ratio decreased and that irradiation caused lipid peroxidation and increases in the amounts of olefinic =CH, carbonyl, and methylene groups of lipids. In addition, ionizing radiation induced a decrease in membrane fluidity, disordering of membrane lipids, strengthening of the hydrogen bonding of the phosphate groups of lipid head-groups, and weakening in the hydrogen bonding of the interfacial carbonyl groups of lipids. Radiation further caused significant decrements in the alpha-helix and turns, and significant increments in the beta-sheet and random coil contents in the protein structure. Hierarchical cluster analyses, performed in the whole region (3030-1000 cm(-1)), lipid (3030-2800 cm(-1)), and protein (1700-1600 cm(-1)) regions separately, successfully differentiated the control and irradiated groups of rat brain membranes and showed that proteins in the membranes are affected more than lipids from the damages induced with ionizing radiation. As a result, the current study showed that FT-IR spectroscopy can be used successfully as a novel method to monitor radiation-induced alterations on biological membranes.",Included
606,"Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in radiation-induced cerebral necrosis. Apparent diffusion coefficient in lesion components OBJECTIVE: The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the diffusivity of different components of radiation-induced cerebral necrosis with the hypothesis that the diffusivity of the various components is elevated to different degrees.METHODS: Twenty-two patients (18 men, 4 women, aged 34-72 years) with radiation injury to the temporal lobes after radiation therapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with diagnosis confirmed on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were studied with coronal T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Using three diffusion directions for diffusion-weighted MRI, the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of the enhanced component, the cystic or liquefied component, and the edema component were measured.RESULTS: ADCs of all components of RT-induced cerebral necrosis (154 +/- 21.6 x 10(-5) mm2/s for contrast-enhanced component; 188 +/- 47.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s for cystic/liquefied component; 177 +/- 35.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s for edema component) were all significantly higher (P<0.00001) than ADC of the normal frontal lobe white matter (82 +/- 12.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s). The ADC of the enhanced component was significantly lower than that of the cystic/liquefied component (P=0.0096) and the edema component (P=0.003). A significantly lower ADC was shown in the enhanced component in temporal lobes showing both short-term morphologic deterioration (P=0.024) and occurrence of deterioration on long-term follow-up (P=0.04) compared with the temporal lobes that showed improvement or stable morphology.CONCLUSIONS: ADCs of the contrast-enhanced component, cystic/liquefied component, and edema in RT-induced cerebral necrosis was significantly higher than in normal brain parenchyma. There is association between a lower ADC in the contrast-enhanced component and morphologic deterioration.",Excluded

1716,"Radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas Background: Radiosurgery has been established as an important alternative to microsurgery. We report our experience with radiosurgery for tumor control and the complications of unilateral vestibular schwannomas. Method(s): We reviewed our early experience regarding clinical presentation, management and outcomes in 45 patients with acoustic schwannomas who underwent gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery. The median follow-up period was 25 months (range, 6-48 months). Thirteen patients had undergone 1 or more previous resections before radiosurgery; 32 underwent radiosurgery as the first procedure. Median tumor volume was 4.5 mL (range, 0.5-30.0), and median radiotherapy dose was 11.5 Gy (range, 10.5-14.0 Gy). Result(s): Tumor control was achieved in 43 patients (95.6%). Loss of central contrast enhancement was a characteristic change and was noted in 29 patients (64.4%). Reduction in tumor size was shown in 15 patients (33.3%). Thirteen patients (28.9%) had good or serviceable hearing preoperatively, and in all of these, the preoperative status was retained immediately after radiosurgery. At follow-up, however, 10 patients (76.9%) had preserved hearing and 3 (23.1%) had reduced hearing on the treated side. Hearing in 1 patient that was not serviceable preoperatively later improved to a serviceable level. No patients had delayed facial palsy or lower cranial nerve dysfunction, but one had delayed trigeminal sensory loss. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery achieved a high tumor control rate and a relatively low post-radiosurgical complication rate for acoustic neuromas. Â© 2005 Elsevier. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2841,"[Influence of 460-480 nm wavelength light at three different irradiance on retina tissue of SD rats] OBJECTIVE: To investigate the survival of SD rat retinal cells after irradiated with 460-480 nm wavelength blue light at three different irradiance.METHODS: Experimental study. Seventy-six SD rats six weeks old were divided into control group (4 animals) and experimental groups (18 different subgroups) with 4 animals for each group. Healthy SD rats were exposed to the 460-480 nm blue light for 3 or 12 hours on three different irradiance of 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) respectively. After recovery in darkness for 4 hours, 24 hours or 3 days, retinal tissue was collected after the eyes were enucleated. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to evaluate the general anatomical changes of the rat retinal layers. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling was performed to detect apoptotic cells and immunofluorescence staining was conducted to illustrate the expression and location of related proteins in Muller cells. The number of ganglion cells was analyzed by one-way ANOVA.RESULTS: No injury was observed in SD rat retina at the irradiance of 0.6 W/m(2). Retinal cells were damaged with irradiance at 10.0 W/m(2), which mainly affected photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells, while Muller cells of retinal inner nuclear layer were also involved. Apoptosis began after 4 hours of exposure and peaked at 24 hours. Moderate damage of retina was observed at the irradiance of 1.5 W/m(2) after 12 hours rather than 3 hours exposure. The number of ganglion cells was significantly different among the different groups 3 days after exposure. When the exposure time was 3 hours, the number of retinal ganglion cells under different irradiance at 0.0, 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) was respectively 41.42 +/- 0.17, 40.58 +/- 0.50, 40.92 +/- 0.32 and 22.83 +/- 0.79 (F = 1305.86, P = 0.000). When the exposure time was 12 hours, the number of retinal ganglion cells under different irradiance at 0.0, 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) was respectively 41.42 +/- 0.17, 40.83 +/- 0.69, 41.08 +/- 0.17 and 22.75 +/- 0.83 (F = 1095.78, P = 0.000). The number of retinal ganglion cells showed significant decrease 3 days after exposure at the irradiance 10.0 W/m(2) (exposure time 3 h:t = 52.32, P = 0.000; exposure time 12 h:t = 47.58, P = 0.000).CONCLUSIONS: The safe exposure time to SD rat retina layers is 12 hours for the blue light with wavelength 460-480 nm at the irradiance 0.6 W/m(2). And the safe exposure time descends to 3 hours at the irradiance 1.5 W/m(2).",Excluded

1932,"Tryptophan pet has a strong prognostic value in post-treatment high-grade gliomas BACKGROUND: MRI has limited prognostic value in patients with previously treated high-grade gliomas. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with alpha[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT), a radiotracer tracking tryptophan transport and metabolism via the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway, can accurately differentiate glioma recurrence from radiation injury (J Nucl Med 2012;53:1058-64). We evaluated AMT uptake as a prognostic marker for survival in post-treatment patients with high-grade glioma. METHOD(S): AMT-PET was performed in 39 patients > 1 month (median: 325 days) after resection and chemoradiation of a grade III or IV astrocytic glioma. All patients were followed for at least 1 year or until death after PET. Maximum standardized uptake values (AMT-SUVmax) were measured in brain regions suspicious for tumor on MRI. Unidirectional AMT uptake (K) was also quantified from dynamic PETand blood radioactivity data (available in 34 cases). Optimal cutoff thresholds for prediction of 1-year survival were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and survival of patients with above vs. below threshold values was evaluated in thewhole group, and in two subgroups (glioblastoma [n = 33], no further surgical or radiation treatment after PET [n = 22]). RESULT(S): For 1-year survival, sensitivity/specificity was 84%/80% for AMT-SUVmax and 76%/88% for lesion/cortex K-ratio, when using ROC-defined cutoff thresholds. Both AMT-SUVmax and K-ratio were highly prognostic for survival in all patient groups. Estimated median survival after PET was 966 and 876 days in the low, vs. 177 days in both the high AMT-SUVmax and high K-ratio groups, respectively (log-rank: p, > 001). Age- and gradecorrected Cox regression analyses showed a robust association between high AMT values and shorter overall survival after the PET scan (SUVmax: OR= 6.2 [2.2-17.5], K-ratio: OR= 6.6 [2.3-18.6]; p<= > 001). CONCLUSION(S): Focal increase of AMT uptake on PET has a strong prognostic value for 1-year and overall survival in patients with a previously treated high-grade glioma.",Excluded
1191,"Randomized, prospective, and controlled clinical trial of pulsed electromagnetic field stimulation for cervical fusion Background context: Multilevel fusions, the use of allograft bone, and smoking have been associated with an increased risk of nonunion after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation has been shown to increase arthrodesis rates after lumbar spine fusion surgery, but there are minimal data concerning the effect of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. Purpose(s): To determine the efficacy and safety of PEMF stimulation as an adjunct to arthrodesis after ACDF in patients with potential risk factors for nonunion. Study design: A randomized, controlled, prospective multicenter clinical trial. Patient Sample: Three hundred and twenty-three patients with radiographic evidence (computed tomography-myelogram [CT-myelo] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of a compressed cervical nerve root and symptomatic radiculopathy appropriate to the compressed root that had failed to respond to nonoperative management were enrolled in the study. The patients were either smokers (more than one pack per day) and/or were undergoing multilevel fusions. All patients underwent ACDF using the Smith-Robinson technique. Allograft bone and an anterior cervical plate were used in all cases. Outcome measures: Measurements were obtained preoperatively and at each postoperative interval and included neurologic assessment, visual analog scale (VAS) scores for shoulder/arm pain at rest and with activity, SF-12 scores, the neck disability index (NDI), and radiographs (anteroposterior, lateral, and flexion-extension views). Two orthopedic surgeons not otherwise affiliated with the study and blinded to treatment group evaluated the radiographs, as did a blinded radiologist. Adverse events were reported by all patients throughout the study to determine device safety. Method(s): Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those receiving PEMF stimulation after surgery (PEMF group, 163 patients) and those not receiving PEMF stimulation (control group, 160 patients). Postoperative care was otherwise identical. Follow-up was carried out at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Result(s): The PEMF and control groups were comparable with regard to age, gender, race, past medical history, smoking status, and litigation status. Both groups were also comparable in terms of baseline diagnosis (herniated disc, spondylosis, or both) and number of levels operated (one, two, three, or four). At 6 months postoperatively, the PEMF group had a significantly higher fusion rate than the control group (83.6% vs. 68.6%, p=.0065). At 12 months after surgery, the stimulated group had a fusion rate of 92.8% compared with 86.7% for the control group (p=.1129). There were no significant differences between the PEMF and control groups with regard to VAS pain scores, NDI, or SF-12 scores at 6 or 12 months. No significant differences were found in the incidence of adverse events in the groups. Conclusion(s): This is the first randomized, controlled trial that analyzes the effects of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. PEMF stimulation significantly improved the fusion rate at 6 months postoperatively in patients undergoing ACDF with an allograft and an anterior cervical plate, the eligibility criteria being patients who were smokers or had undergone multilevel cervical fusion. At 12 months postoperatively, however, the fusion rate for PEMF patients was not significantly different from that of the control group. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events in the two groups, indicating that the use of PEMF stimulation is safe in this clinical setting. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc.

810,"Depleted and natural uranium: chemistry and toxicological effects Depleted uranium (DU) is a by-product from the chemical enrichment of naturally occurring uranium. Natural uranium is comprised of three radioactive isotopes: (238)U, (235)U, and (234)U. This enrichment process reduces the radioactivity of DU to roughly 30% of that of natural uranium. Nonmilitary uses of DU include counterweights in airplanes, shields against radiation in medical radiotherapy units and transport of radioactive isotopes. DU has also been used during wartime in heavy tank armor, armor-piercing bullets, and missiles, due to its desirable chemical properties coupled with its decreased radioactivity. DU weapons are used unreservedly by the armed forces. Chemically and toxicologically, DU behaves similarly to natural uranium metal. Although the effects of DU on human health are not easily discerned, they may be produced by both its chemical and radiological properties. DU can be toxic to many bodily systems, as presented in this review. Most importantly, normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, and heart can be affected by DU exposure. Numerous other systems can also be affected by DU exposure, and these are also reviewed. Despite the prevalence of DU usage in many applications, limited data exist regarding the toxicological consequences on human health. This review focuses on the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and toxicological effects of depleted and natural uranium on several systems in the mammalian body.

1329,"CyberKnife frameless single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery for tumors of the sacrum OBJECT: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial lesions is well established. The experience with radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal and sacral lesions is more limited. Sacral lesions should be amenable to radiosurgical treatment similar to that used for their intracranial counterparts. The authors evaluated a single- fraction radiosurgical technique performed using the CyberKnife Real-Time Image-Guided Radiosurgery System for the treatment of the sacral lesion. METHOD(S): The CyberKnife is a frameless radiosurgery system based on the coupling of an orthogonal pair of x-ray cameras to a dynamically manipulated robot-mounted linear accelerator possessing six degrees of freedom, which guides the therapy beam to the intended target without the need for frame-based fixation. All sacral lesions were located and tracked for radiation delivery relative to fiducial bone markers placed percutaneously. Eighteen patients were treated with single-fraction radiosurgery. Tumor histology included one benign and 17 malignant tumors. Dose plans were calculated based on computerized tomography scans acquired using 1.25-mm slices. Planning treatment volume was defined as the radiographically documented tumor volume with no margin. Tumor dose was maintained at 12 to 20 Gy to the 80% isodose line (mean 15 Gy). Tumor volume ranged from 23.6 to 187.4 ml (mean 90 ml). The volume of the cauda equina receiving greater than 8 Gy ranged from 0 to 1 ml (mean 0.1 ml). All patients underwent the procedure in an outpatient setting. No acute radiation toxicity or new neurological deficits occurred during the mean follow-up period of 6 months. Pain improved in all 13 patients who were symptomatic prior to treatment. No tumor progression has been documented on follow-up imaging. CONCLUSION(S): Stereotactic radiosurgery was found to be feasible, safe, and effective for the treatment of both benign and malignant sacral lesions. The major potential benefits of radiosurgical ablation of sacral lesions are relatively short treatment time in an outpatient setting and minimal or no side effects. This new technique offers a new and important therapeutic modality for the primary treatment of a variety of sacral tumors or for lesions not amenable to open surgical techniques.",Excluded

594,"Impact of wavefront distortion and scattering on 2-photon microscopy in mammalian brain tissue Two-photon (2P) microscopy is widely used in neuroscience, but the optical properties of brain tissue are poorly understood. We have investigated the effect of brain tissue on the 2P point spread function (PSF2p) by imaging fluorescent beads through living cortical slices. By combining this with measurements of the mean free path of the excitation light, adaptive optics and vector-based modeling that includes phase modulation and scattering, we show that tissue-induced wavefront distortions are the main determinant of enlargement and distortion of the PSF2p at intermediate imaging depths. Furthermore, they generate surrounding lobes that contain more than half of the 2P excitation. These effects reduce the resolution of fine structures and contrast and they, together with scattering, limit 2P excitation. Our results disentangle the contributions of scattering and wavefront distortion in shaping the cortical PSF2p, thereby providing a basis for improved 2P microscopy.",Excluded

972,"The frequency of adverse events by radiation therapy for atomic bomb survivors with cancer Purpose/Objective(s): In Japan, there are many survivors who received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb in 1945. Currently, atomic bomb survivors (ABS) who suffered from cancer are treated as same as usual cancer patients. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse events (AE) of radiation therapy (RT) are increased or not in ABS. To clarify the safety of RT for ABS, we evaluated the frequency of AE by RT in ABS. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients who received curative RT for cancer between 2005 and 2010. We selected the ABS who were officially certified by the Japanese government. AE were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score Ver.3. One hundred and sixty-five ABS were recruited in this study. Median age was 74 years old (59 to 93) and 96 (58.2%) were men. Median age at the time receiving ionizing radiation by atomic bomb was 11 years old (0 to 32). One hundred and thirty-six ABS (82.4%) were pre-treatment performance status (PS) 0, 21 (12.7%) was PS 1, and 8 (4.8%) were PS 2 or over. Thirty-seven were diagnosed with head and neck, 32 with genitourinary, 29 with breast, 27 with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic, 23 with lung and mediastinum, and 17 with other cancer. Result(s): One hundred four ABS were definitive irradiation, 48 were postoperative irradiation, and 13 were pre-operative irradiation. Concurrent chemotherapy was performed on 51. Median dose of external RTwas 50 Gy (30 to 78) based on their cancer type. Fifteen patients were performed on stereotactic RT, 12 on intensity-modulated RT, and 11 on brachytherapy. All patients were received standard dose irradiation and completed planned RT. No patients received extended RTover 1 week. Median observation time was 40 months (1 to 84). One hundred fifty-six patients (94.5%) were alive and 9 (5.5%) were dead when at the time investigated. There were no patients who died of AE in the entire course. In acute AE, sixteen patients (9.7%) were classified into grade 3 or above, i.e. one with esophageal mucositis and 15 with hematotoxicity (Grade 3: 11, Grade 4: 4). All these patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Grade 4 or 5 non-hematotoxicitic AE was not identified. In late AE, twelve patients (7.3%) were classified into Grade 3 or above. Four patients were classified into Grade 4, i.e. 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 with cerebral infarction.

1797,"Menstrual restoration in severe panhypopituitarism many years after cranial irradiation for suprasellar germinoma Purpose: We report a very rare case showing menstrual restoration in severe pan-hypopituitarism many years after cranial irradiation for suprasellar germinoma.Case: A 30-year-old, almost primarily amenorrheic woman with severe panhypopituitarism presented with cyclic genital bleeding for the previous five months. She had menstruated once, when she was 13 years old. When she was 14 years old, she was diagnosed with a suprasellar germinoma measuring 10 mm in diameter, which led to diabetes insipidus. Cranial irradiation with a total dose of 24 Gy and chemotherapy resulted in complete tumor remission. She developed severe hypopituitarism [luteinizing hormone (LH) = 0.4 mIU/mL, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) = 1.7 mIU/mL, and serum estradiol (E2) level < 10 pg/mL]. She had received multiple hormone replacement therapies for many years. When she was 29 years old, she expressed a desire to become pregnant. Serum gonadotropin and E2 levels increased (LH = 5.8 mIU/mL, FSH = 5.9 mIU/mL, and E2 = 58 pg/mL). She conceived with clomiphene therapy, and then delivered a healthy baby. Eight months after parturition, her basal body temperature and serum progesterone levels indicated recovery of ovulatory cycles. Ten months after parturition, she also spontaneously conceived.Conclusion: Menstrual restoration is very rare in severe panhypopituitarism after cranial irradiation. A relatively low dose of irradiation and small tumor size may have contributed to the recovery of menstruation in our patient.",Excluded
372,"The functional synergism of microRNA clustering provides therapeutically relevant epigenetic interference in glioblastoma MicroRNA deregulation is a consistent feature of glioblastoma, yet the biological effect of each single gene is generally modest, and therapeutically negligible. Here we describe a module of microRNAs, constituted by miR-124, miR-128 and miR-137, which are co-expressed during neuronal differentiation and simultaneously lost in gliomagenesis. Each one of these miRs targets several transcriptional regulators, including the oncogenic chromatin repressors EZH2, BMI1 and LSD1, which are functionally interdependent and involved in glioblastoma recurrence after therapeutic chemoradiation. Synchronizing the expression of these three microRNAs in a gene therapy approach displays significant anticancer synergism, abrogates this epigenetic-mediated, multi-protein tumor survival mechanism and results in a 5-fold increase in survival when combined with chemotherapy in murine glioblastoma models. These transgenic microRNA clusters display intercellular propagation in vivo, via extracellular vesicles, extending their biological effect throughout the whole tumor. Our results support the rationale and feasibility of combinatorial microRNA strategies for anticancer therapies.",Excluded

1731,"Update on small cell lung cancer management Small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) account for,15-20% of all lung cancers. Because SCLC is almost always associated with long-term tobacco smoking, abstinence from smoking and smoking cessation are crucial for primary prevention. Because symptoms are generally unspecific, the disease is often diagnosed late, with 70% of patients already in stage IIIb or IV at the time of diagnosis. Early detection of SCLC through screening is under investigation. Chemotherapy, generally a platinum-based combination, is the mainstay of therapy and is generally combined with radiation in the first-line treatment of tumours up to stage IIIb. Surgery has a place in the diagnosis and therapy of stage I SCLC, but plays no key role in advanced cancer. In patients who respond to first-line therapy, prophylactic cranial irradiation can prevent brain metastases and improve overall survival. Although the initial response to treatment is usually good, SCLC tends to relapse quickly. This makes second-line therapy quite important. Topotecan is the most studied and widely used agent in second-line therapy; however, newer agents, including biological therapies, are under study.",Excluded
492,"Criteria for assessing the efficacy of brachytherapy of uveal melanomas, complications of therapy and there prevention. [Russian] The authors assess the efficacy of brachytherapy of uveal melanomas in 954 patients. Strontium ophthalmoapplicators were used in 652, rutenium ones in 302 patients. As a rule, Sr applicators were sutured in patients with tumors up to 3.5 mm thick and Ru ones in cases with tumors thicker than 3.5 mm. A special program was used for individual approach and improving the accuracy of planning. A total of 74.5% of patients have been followed up for at least 3 years, with check-ups every 3-6 months. The effect of brachytherapy was considered positive in cases with complete resorption or at least 50% decrease of the tumor and a stable clinical picture for 9-12 months. In 60% of patients the tumor regressed completely, in 16% partially, and in 24% there were signs of activation of melanoma growth one year after treatment. The frequency of radiation complications was as follows: retinopaty, 3.15%; neuroretinopathy, 1.1%; hemophthalmia, 0.9%; neovascular glaucoma, 1.1%; cataract, 0.63%. The incidence of radiation complications increases with increase of the applicator power and rigidity of exposure. Computer planning of brachytherapy with due consideration for the size of the tumor and the eye and localization of the neoplasm for each case will help decrease the incidence of complications.",Excluded
2133,"Phase I study of weekly nedaplatin and concurrent pelvic radiotherapy as adjuvant therapy after radical surgery for cervical cancer Nedaplatin is an analog of cisplatin that was developed in Japan, and it exhibits less nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity than cisplatin. This study aimed to determine the recommended dose of weekly nedaplatin chemoradiotherapy in high-risk patients following radical surgery. Fifteen patients who required postoperative pelvic radiotherapy after radical surgery for cervical cancer were enrolled in the present study. Nedaplatin was designed to be administered for eight cycles (minimum five cycles) beginning at a weekly dose of 22.5 mg/m(2) and then escalating to 25, 27.5, and then to 30 mg/m(2). Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy and/or planned chemotherapy (prior to the completion of five cycles) due to toxicity. Nedaplatin administration was interrupted prior to the completion of five cycles in one of six patients at a dose of 27.5 mg/m(2). A more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy did not occur in any patient. Nedaplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) was safely administered, and two of three patients could receive the planned chemotherapy consisting of eight cycles of weekly nedaplatin. Our recommended weekly nedaplatin dose was determined to be 30 mg/m(2) administered for more than five cycles and up to eight cycles if possible. Weekly administration of nedaplatin may be more tolerable and less toxic than weekly administration of cisplatin.",Excluded
3213,"Chemoradiotherapy for primary CNS lymphoma: an intent-to-treat analysis with complete follow-up OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of a preradiation chemotherapy regimen in patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), with emphasis on long-term outcomes.METHODS: In this prospective phase II trial, patients with a new diagnosis of PCNSL received two cycles of intrathecal (12 mg) and IV (1 g/m2) methotrexate (MTX), thiotepa (30 mg/m2), and procarbazine (75 mg/m2), prior to whole-brain radiotherapy (RT).RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled (ages 26 to 71, median 53). Median Karnofsky performance scale score was 70. After chemotherapy, 7 patients (41%) had a complete response (CR) and 7 (41%) a partial response (PR). After RT, 13 (76%) patients achieved a CR, 2 (12%) a PR, and 2 (12%) had disease progression. Relapse occurred in 7 (41%) patients; median disease-free survival was 18 months. Fifteen (88%) patients have died: 8 (47%) from PCNSL, 5 (29%) from neurotoxicity, and 2 (12%) from unknown causes. Median overall survival was 32 months. Two patients (12%) are alive and disease free at 12 years follow-up. Nephrotoxicity was a minor complication, but grades 3 and 4 myelosuppression were found in 5 (29%) patients.CONCLUSIONS: This regimen resulted in an efficacy and toxicity profile comparable to other combined modality treatments, despite the relatively low dose of methotrexate. It may be a useful option in patients unable to tolerate higher doses. Procarbazine and thiotepa are potential candidates for incorporation into chemotherapy regimens aiming to decrease the incidence of neurotoxicity. First relapse and neurotoxicity within 2 years of diagnosis seem to be critical for predicting long-term outcomes.",Excluded
308,"Gene expression, telomere and cognitive deficit analysis as a function of Chornobyl radiation dose and age: from in utero to adulthood UNLABELLED: Objective - to estimate the possible effects of low dose ionizing radiation on human cognitive function in adult hood and in utero.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive tests, telomere length and expression of genes regulating telomere function were studied in Chornobyl cleanup workers who were exposed to doses under 500 mSv (n = 326) and subjects exposed in utero during the first days after the accident Prypiat town (n = 104). The neurocognitive assessment covered mem ory, attention, language, executive and visiospatial functions. In young adults after prenatal exposure a relation ship was analyzed between a cognitive function and radiation dose to foetus, brain and thyroid gland. Internal con trols were used for both groups - the group of Chornobyl cleanup workers exposed in doses less than 20 mSv and an age matched comparison group from radioactively contaminated areas for subjects exposed in utero.RESULTS: Cognitive functions in cleanup workers exposed to ionizing radiation at adulthood are characterized by symptoms of a mild cognitive impairment according to the MMSE (mean group score 25,58 +/- 2,95) and a significant ly higher level of mental disorders according to the BPRS in a dose related manner. Cleanup workers exposed to doses over 500 mSv demonstrate a significant cognitive deficit in comparison with those exposed below 500 mSv and espe cially non exposed patients. Subjects exposed in utero during the check at age of 25-27 years exhibit an excess of the disorders of autonomic nervous system (ICD 10: G90). Neurological microsymptoms as well as neurotic, stress relat ed and somatoform disorders (F40-F48) dominate. Relationship were revealed between the TERT, TERF1, TERF2 genes expression, relative telomere length (RTL),cognitive deficit and cerebrovascular pathology, radiation dose and age. Telomere length in cleanup workers is sreduced after 50 years (6.1 %). The most significant reduction in telomere length is shown after 70 years (11.7 %). Negative correlation was found between telomere length and degree of cog nitive deficit (MMSE scale) and between age and degree of cognitive deficit. The RTL is significantly decreased in groups of persons with cognitive deficit compared to a comparison group. Telomere length at the late period after low dose radiation exposure is downregulated by the high TERF2 gene expression combined with low expression of TERT gene. After exposure to doses over 250-500 mSv a cognitive deficit and dementia were associated with a substantial increase in TERT gene expression, overexpression of TERF1 and decrease in expression of TERF2 gene. A relationship was revealed between the TERF2 gene expression and CD95+ cell fraction susceptible to apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that cognitive deficit in humans at a late period after radiation exposure is influ enced by dose, age at exposure and gene regulation of telomere function.",Included

The TM arose in the course of studies on other questions of radiation effects.METHODS: The left neck and skull base of sixty female Wistar rats, 3 to 4 months of age at the beginning of the external irradiation, were subjected to roentgen rays exposure, fractionated to 2 Grays daily, either up to 20, 40 or 60 Gy. The midline of the neck and skull was always inside the radiation field. The animals were sacrificed either 6 months or 12 months after completion of the randomly assigned irradiation protocol. Five non-irradiated rats served as controls.RESULTS: No TM developed in the non-irradiated animals. Out of 60 irradiated rats 9 developed a pituitary TM (15%). In remnants of the normal adenohypophysis we revealed immunohistochemical reactivity for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In the radiation-induced adenomas, 4 TM were immuno-reactive for TSH, 4 for GH, 2 for PRL, and 2 for FSH. The TM did not react with anti-ACTH and anti-LH (luteinizing hormone) anti-sera.CONCLUSIONS: Obviously, irradiation accelerates the development of pituitary gland adenomas. In this series the TM were predominantly incidental findings at necropsies after pretermed follow-up intervals with a variety of hormone-producing cells. On the other hand, four of nine TM were null adenomas. Necropsies of the brain should be carried out routinely in irradiation studies of the skull.",Included

To compare various fractionation schedules, the biologically effective dose (BED) was applied. SBRT dose was calculated with linear-quadratic model and normalized to a 2-Gy equivalent dose (nBED, alpha/beta =2 Gy for spinal cord, alpha/beta =10 Gy for tumor). Doses to a point within the spinal cord that received the maximum dose (Pmax) were checked. Local control failure was defined as progression by imaging study. Overall survival, progression free survival, delivered radiation dose to tumor and spinal cord, and spinal cord Pmax nBED were compared in two groups.RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation doses to tumor margin during SBRT were 51.1 Gy2/10 (retreatment) and 50.7 Gy2/10 (initial treatment). Mean survival was 29.6 months (overall)/20.7 months (retreatment)/ 32.4 months (initial treatment). Mean progression free period was 23.9 months (overall)/18.0 months (retreatment)/ 26.0 months (initial treatment). Radiological control rates of retreatment and initial treatment group were 96%/95% at six months, 81%/89% at 12 months and 79%/90% at 24 months. Among 54 retreatment lesions, 13 lesions showed local control failure during follow-up. With regard to spinal cord radiation dose during SBRT, Spinal cord Pmax nBED was 46.2 Gy2/2 (retreatment) and 48.7 Gy2/2 (initial treatment). In retreatment group, total nBED to spinal cord was a mean of 83.4 Gy2/2. There was no case of radiation myelopathy detected.CONCLUSIONS: Retreatment of spinal metastases using SBRT provided effective local control without neurological complications.",Excluded

Copper octabromotetracarboranylphenylporphyrin (CuTCPBr), synthesized by bromination of CuTCPH, is one of several new minimally toxic analogues of CuTCPH being studied in our laboratory, which could possess comparable or better tumour-targeting properties with enhanced tumour cytotoxicity. Its biodistribution, biokinetics and toxicity in mice with subcutaneous EMT-6 (mammary) or SCCVII (squamous cell) carcinomas were compared with those of CuTCPH. The administration of approximately 200 mg kg(-1) of either porphyrin in six intraperitoneal injections over 2 days had no apparent effect, but administration of approximately 400 mg kg(-1) slightly lowered body weights, elevated alanine and aspartate transaminase activities in blood plasma, and depressed blood platelet counts for several days. Enzymes and platelets returned to normal within 5 days after those injections and body weights returned to normal within 2 weeks. High average concentrations of boron from either porphyrin were achieved in the two tumour models from a total dose of approximately 200 mg kg(-1). The high tumour boron concentration decreased slowly while concentrations in blood decreased rapidly. Boron concentrations in brain and skin were consistently lower than in tumour by a factor of 10 or more.

3384,"Coding of Azimuthal Directions via Time-Compensated Combination of Celestial Compass Cues Many animals use the sun as a reference for spatial orientation [1-3]. In addition to sun position, the sky provides two other sources of directional information, a color gradient [4] and a polarization pattern [5]. Work on insects has predominantly focused on celestial polarization as an orientation cue [6, 7]. Relying on sky polarization alone, however, poses the following two problems: E vector orientations in the sky are not suited to distinguish between the solar and antisolar hemisphere of the sky, and the polarization pattern changes with changing solar elevation during the day [8, 9]. Here, we present neurons that overcome both problems in a locust's brain. The spiking activity of these neurons depends (1) on the E vector orientation of dorsally presented polarized light, (2) on the azimuthal, i.e., horizontal, direction, and (3) on the wavelength of an unpolarized light source. Their tuning to these stimuli matches the distribution of a UV/green chromatic contrast as well as the polarization of natural skylight and compensates for changes in solar elevation during the day. The neurons are, therefore, suited to code for solar azimuth by concurrent combination of signals from the spectral gradient, intensity gradient, and polarization pattern of the sky.

1080,"Carbamylated erythropoietin reduces radiosurgically-induced brain injury Gamma knife radiosurgery is an attractive noninvasive treatment of brain tumors and vascular malformations that minimizes collateral tissue damage. However, exposure of normal tissue to even low-dose radiation triggers a cascade of acute and chronic injury and potentially significant morbidity and mortality. Because many irradiated patients now survive for years, identifying methods to prevent radiotherapy-induced collateral tissue damage is a major focus of current research. Erythropoietin (EPO), a cytokine produced locally by many tissues in response to injury, antagonizes apoptosis, reduces inflammation, and promotes healing. Systemic administration of recombinant EPO, widely used for treatment of anemia, provides robust protection from numerous insults in a variety of tissues, including the brain. Although irradiation injury is likely sensitive to EPO, the hematopoietic activity of EPO is undesirable in this setting, increasing erythrocyte number and predisposing to thrombosis. To avoid these potential adverse effects, we developed carbamylated EPO (CEPO) which does not stimulate the bone marrow. In this study, we show that CEPO (50 microg kg(-1) intraperitoneally) improves functional outcome when administered to adult rats just before, and then once daily for 10 d after, a necrotizing dose of radiation (100 Gy) to the right striatum. Immediately following irradiation, use and reflex movements of the contralateral forelimb to vibrissae stimulation were abnormal but rapidly improved in animals receiving CEPO. Moreover, histological examination revealed that the extent of brain necrosis after 90 days was reduced by approximately 50%. These findings further extend the kinds of injury for which administration of a tissue-protective cytokine provides benefit.",Excluded

Method(s): Using a 3.0 Tesla scanner, dual-echo and diffusion tensor (DT) MRI images were derived from 19 patients with DOA (10 females, mean age = 43 years, range = 22-64) and 20 sex- and agematched controls. A complete neurological and neuro-ophthalmologic examination was obtained in all patients. TBSS analysis was performed using FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox. Result(s): Visual acuity was reduced in almost all patients, whereas none of the patients had extra-ocular neurological complications. Focal lesions in the brain WM were identified in ten patients. Three patients presented hyperintense optic nerve lesions on T2 weighted scans. Optic nerve and chiasm atrophy were detected in twelve patients. TBSS analysis showed that compared to controls, patients with DOA had significant lower mean diffusivity, axial and radial diffusivity in WM of the cerebellum, brainstem, thalamus, frontooccipital- temporal lobes, including the cingulum, corpus callosum, corticospinal tract and optic radiation bilaterally. No abnormalities of fractional anisotropy were detected. DT MRI measures were correlate with ganglion cell complex thickness. Conclusion(s): Patients with DOA linked to OPA1 gene mutations present diffuse WM microstructural abnormalities. Clinical expression of DOA could be influenced by the level of mithocondrial impairment and potential compensatory mechanisms, such as increased protein expression. Restricted water diffusion might be explained by a higher macromolecular water binding, due to increased molecular crowding and microviscosity.",Excluded

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either PCI (100 patients) or no PCI (111 patients). Each centre was allowed to use its own PCI protocol as long as the total dose was within the range of 24-30 Gy and delivered in less than 3 weeks with fractions of 3 Gy or less. The mean follow-up is 5 years. The survival curves do not differ significantly (P=0.25) between the two groups. The 4-year overall survival rate (95% confidence interval) is 22% [15-32%] in the PCI group versus 16% [10-25%] in the control group. The relative risk of death in the PCI group compared to the control group is 0.84 (95% CI=[0.62-1.13]). The incidence of brain metastasis is lower in the PCI group, but the difference is not statistically significant (P=0.14). The 4-year cumulative rate of brain metastasis is 44% [32-57%] in the PCI group compared to 51% [38-63%] in the control group.

PAsAG protected plasmid DNA from gamma-radiation induced damages under in vitro conditions. Presence of 1.6 mM PAsAG inhibited the disappearance of ccc (covalently closed circular) form of plasmid pBR322 with a dose modifying factor of 1.5. Comet assay studies on mouse spleen cells exposed to 6 Gy gamma-radiation (ex vivo) in presence and absence of PAsAG revealed that cellular DNA was effectively protected by this compound from radiation induced damages. Oral administration of 80 mg/kg body weight of PAsAG to mice 1 hour prior to 6 Gy whole body gamma-radiation exposure, efficiently protected cellular DNA in tissues such as spleen, bone marrow and blood, from radiation induced damages as indicated by alkaline comet assay. Oxidative stress in tissues such as liver and brain of mice, following whole body exposure to various doses of gamma-radiation (2-8 Gy), monitored as levels of GSH and peroxidation of lipids, were found considerably reduced when PAsAG was orally administered (80 mg/kg body weight) to the mice one hour prior to the radiation exposure. PAsAG administration improved the per cent survival of mice following exposure to 10 Gy whole body gamma-radiation. Thus PAsAG could act as a radioprotector under in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo conditions of ionizing-radiation exposure.",Included
1153,"Use of synchrotron medical microbeam irradiation to investigate radiation-induced bystander and abscopal effects in vivo The question of whether bystander and abscopal effects are the same is unclear. Our experimental system enables us to address this question by allowing irradiated organisms to partner with unexposed individuals. Organs from both animals and appropriate sham and scatter dose controls are tested for expression of several endpoints such as calcium flux, role of 5HT, reporter assay cell death and proteomic profile. The results show that membrane related functions of calcium and 5HT are critical for true bystander effect expression. Our original inter-animal experiments used fish species whole body irradiated with low doses of X-rays, which prevented us from addressing the abscopal effect question. Data which are much more relevant in radiotherapy are now available for rats which received high dose local irradiation to the implanted right brain glioma. The data were generated using quasi-parallel microbeams at the biomedical beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble France. This means we can directly compare abscopal and ""true"" bystander effects in a rodent tumour model. Analysis of right brain hemisphere, left brain and urinary bladder in the directly irradiated animals and their unirradiated partners strongly suggests that bystander effects (in partner animals) are not the same as abscopal effects (in the irradiated animal). Furthermore, the presence of a tumour in the right brain alters the magnitude of both abscopal and bystander effects in the tissues from the directly irradiated animal and in the unirradiated partners which did not contain tumours, meaning the type of signal was different.",Included
3087,"Acid-induced unfolding of brain-derived neurotrophic factor results in the formation of a monomeric ""a state"" Recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor in acid undergoes a slow loss of tertiary structure as monitored by both near-UV circular dichroism and fluorescence, and appears to retain some secondary structure, as monitored by far-UV circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This loss of tertiary structure parallels a decrease in the weight average molecular weight, from dimer to monomer, when examined using light scattering. Increasing the temperature accelerates this slow reaction. This process may be described most simply as N2 in equilibrium with 2D where N and D are the native and denatured forms of the protein, respectively. However, the acid denaturation strongly depends on the protein concentration, with higher concentration resulting in a lower rate and extent of denaturation. This suggests that the more complicated mechanism N2 in equilibrium with 2N in equilibrium with 2D more accurately describes the denaturation, where the dissociation into a native monomer is the rate-limiting step, and the conversion of N to D occurs relatively rapidly. Size-exclusion chromatography (at neutral pH) at several points during denaturation further demonstrated that the amount of tertiary structure remaining paralleled the dimer concentration and also that the monomer form was long-lived, remaining as monomer during the course of the chromatography. Size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity determination indicated that the acid-denatured form is a compact molecule. On the basis of the above data, the acid-denatured form may be considered to be a monomeric compact intermediate A state with no tertiary structure but considerable secondary structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 1-72). We investigated the subjective and objective characteristics of the extrapulmonary masses, redelineated the origin tissue of each on the treatment planning computed tomography scan, and generated dose-volume histograms.RESULTS: In 9 patients (2.4%), extrapulmonary masses were found 3-36 months (median, 14) after irradiation. Coexisting swelling occurred in 3 patients, chest pain in 2, thumb numbness in 1, and arm edema in 1 patient. Extrapulmonary masses occurred in 5 (5.4%) of 92 and 4 (1.4%) of 287 patients irradiated with a 62.5-Gy and 48.0-Gy isocenter dose, respectively. The mean and maximal dose to the origin tissue was 25.8-53.9 Gy (median, 43.7) and 47.5-62.5 Gy (median, 50.2), respectively. In 5 of 9 patients, the standardized uptake values on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography was 1.8-2.8 (median, 2.2). Percutaneous needle biopsy was performed in 3 patients, and all the specimens showed benign fibrotic changes without malignant cells.CONCLUSION: All patients should be carefully followed after stereotactic body radiotherapy. The findings of any new lesion should prompt an assessment for radiation-induced extrapulmonary fibrosis before an immediate diagnosis of recurrence is made.

Repeated 5-d centrifugation of the rats at 2 G produced changes in ultrastructure of SSC layers 3 and 4 evidencing a more effective cortex functioning aimed at facilitation of adaptation to hypergravity repeated after the lengthy delay.",Excluded
2457,"Statistical properties of cerebral CT perfusion imaging systems. Part I. Cerebral blood volume maps generated from nondeconvolution-based systems Purpose: The development and clinical employment of a computed tomography (CT) imaging system benefit from a thorough understanding of the statistical properties of the output images; cerebral CT perfusion (CTP) imaging system is no exception. A series of articles will present statistical properties of CTP systems and the dependence of these properties on system parameters. This Part I paper focuses on the signal and noise properties of cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps calculated using a nondeconvolution-based method. Method(s): The CBV imaging chain was decomposed into a cascade of subimaging stages, which facilitated the derivation of analytical models for the probability density function, mean value, and noise variance of CBV. These models directly take CTP source image acquisition, reconstruction, and postprocessing parameters as inputs. Both numerical simulations and in vivo canine experiments were performed to validate these models. Result(s): The noise variance of CBV is linearly related to the noise variance of source images and is strongly influenced by the noise variance of the baseline images. Uniformly partitioning the total radiation dose budget across all time frames was found to be suboptimal, and an optimal dose partition method was derived to minimize CBV noise. Results of the numerical simulation and animal studies validated the derived statistical properties of CBV. Conclusion(s): The statistical properties of CBV imaging systems can be accurately modeled by extending the linear CT systems theory. Based on the statistical model, several key signal and noise characteristics of CBV were identified and an optimal dose partition method was developed to improve the image quality of CBV.

2748,"In vivo protein secretion by lung. Evidence for active secretion and interspecies differences The present study is an attempt to determine (a) if the lung actively secretes protein into the surface-active fraction of lung lavage returns; (b) if there are interspecies differences in this secretory activity; and (c) if the amount of nonradioactive protein in the lavage surface-active fraction shows interspecies variation. I found that pilocarpine stimulates the release of radioactive protein into the lavage surface-active fraction of rabbits and that this pilocarpine effect is completely blocked by atropine. Inhibition of lung oxygen consumption by iodoacetate is associaged with a dose-dependent inhibition of the pilocarpine-induced secretion. Microtubules may be involved in this secretory process because colchicine inhibits the pilocarpine effect. Of the radioactive protein in the total surface-active fraction (tissue plus lavage returns), a greater percent appears in the lavage surface-active fraction at 2 and 4 h, after a pulsed injection [U-14C] leucine, in the mouse than in the rat, which in turn has a greater amount than the rabbit. There is also a difference in the amount of nonradioactive protein per square meter of alveolar surface area in the lavage surface-active fraction of different species: mouse greater than rabbit greater than cat greater than dog. The amount of nonradioactive protein per square meter of alveolar surface area in the lavage surface-active fraction is directly proportional to the species respiratory rate; the log of the nonradioactive protein in the lavage surface-active fraction is inversely proportional to the log of the species alveolar diameter. I conclude that the lung actively secretes protein into the lavage surface-active fraction, that this secretion is under neurohumoral regulation, and that respiratory rate and alveolar size may influence this secretory activity and the amount of protein in this surface-active fraction.",Excluded
1086,"Fabrication and validation of reference structures for the localization of subdural standard- and micro-electrodes in MRI OBJECTIVE: Report simple reference structure fabrication and validate the precise localization of subdural micro- and standard electrodes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in phantom experiments.APPROACH: Electrode contacts with diameters of 0.3 mm and 4 mm are localized in 1.5 T MRI using reference structures made of silicone and iron oxide nanoparticle doping. The precision of the localization procedure was assessed for several standard MRI sequences and implant orientations in phantom experiments and compared to common clinical localization procedures.MAIN RESULTS: A localization precision of 0.41 +/- 0.20 mm could be achieved for both electrode diameters compared to 1.46 +/- 0.69 mm that was achieved for 4 mm standard electrode contacts localized using a common clinical standard method. The new reference structures are intrinsically bio-compatible, and they can be detected with currently available feature detection software so that a clinical implementation of this technology should be feasible.SIGNIFICANCE: Neuropathologies are increasingly diagnosed and treated with subdural electrodes, where the exact localization of the electrode contacts with respect to the patient's cortical anatomy is a prerequisite for the procedure. Post-implantation electrode localization using MRI may be advantageous compared to the common alternative of CT-MRI image co-registration, as it avoids systematic localization errors associated with the co-registration itself, as well as brain shift and implant movement. Additionally, MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast for the identification of brain lesions without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. Recent studies show that smaller electrodes and high-density electrode grids are ideal for clinical and research purposes, but the localization of these devices in MRI has not been demonstrated.",Excluded
2511,"Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound for unilateral thalamotomy in medication refractory essential tremor Introduction: Essential Tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and is associated with significant functional impairment and disability. Ablative and stimulation-based surgical treatments have been developed to treat the significant number of patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical management. Although often providing effective tremor control, current surgical options have risks associated with intracranial procedures, as well as issues of durability and predictability of treatment response. Here, we explore the application of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) as an alternative, non-invasive means of generating thalamic lesions in patients with treatment-resistant ET. Method(s): Four patients underwent awake MRgFUS thalamotomy for refractory essential tremor (mean age 70.8; mean duration of illness 17.8 years). Diagnosis of refractory ET was confirmed by a movement disorder neurologist, and patients underwent baseline medical and imaging investigations prior to treatment. Tremor assessments and serial structural imaging were performed at 1, 7, 30 and 90 days following the procedure. Result(s): All four patients experienced immediate and sustained improvements in their dominant (treated) hand tremor (Figure 1). At 1- and 3-months following treatment, dominant hand tremor scores were reduced by a mean of 89% and 78%, respectively, on part A of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. Functional impairment decreased significantly at 3-months, with patients reporting improvements in writing, drinking and eating. There were no serious adverse events, with only one patient reporting persistent lip and finger paraesthesias at 3-months. Conclusion(s): MRgFUS appears to be a safe and effective means of non-invasively generating thalamic lesions for the relief of refractory ET. This technology is a promising alternative to radiation- and surgical-based approaches to lesional functional neurosurgery, but requires larger trials with more patients to verify its efficacy.

2616,"Effects of neuro-immuno-modulation on healing of wound combined with local radiation injury in rats PURPOSE: To investigate effects of neuro-immuno-modulation on wound healing by observing changes of cytokines and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormones in acute stress reaction in rats with wound and combined local radiation injury.METHODS: Sixty female Wistar rats (weighting 200 +/- 20 g) were randomly divided into normal control group, wound group and combined wound-local radiation (CWR) group (25 Gy local radiation post wound), 20 rats in each group. Contents of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma and IL-4 in serum were measured and changes of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoid (GC) in serum were analyzed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunologic assay, respectively at different time points post wound and radiation.RESULTS: (1) The level of IFN-gamma, one of the Th1 cell cytokines increased significantly at 14 d post CWR, which was markedly higher than that in control group and wound group. However, the level of IL-4, IL-1beta and IL-6, one of the Th2 cell cytokines, did not show obvious change. (2) Ratio of Th1/Th2 (IFN-gamma/IL-4) in wound group and CWR group increased significantly at 7 d after wound and radiation, which suggested that Th1/Th2 balance drifted to Th1 immune response. The ratio of Th1/Th2 in wound group returned to the normal level up to 14 d after the wound and radiation, while the Th1/Th2 ratio in CWR group increased persistently and was much higher than that in control and wound groups. (3) Level of serous ACTH and GC in CWR group increased at 3 d post wound and radiation, and among them, level of GC showed statistically significant increase, which was much higher than that in control and wound groups.CONCLUSION: Level of serous neurohormone GC in rats increased significantly immediately after wound and radiation; while the level of IFN-gamma showed significant increase only up to 14 d after wound and radiation, and the Th1/Th2 imbalance sustained till 28 d post wound and radiation. In order to reduce acute damage caused by CWR, organic immune system and nerve system showed up a marked regulate effects simultaneously and mutually. Nonetheless, the excessive stress induced by CWR causes disturbance of immunoregulation, which is one of the key reasons for delayed wound healing in CWR.",Included

We evaluated the expression of aBC in BM and pBC with eventual BM and its association with survival. Method(s): Under IRB approval (UNC/Duke), we established a clinically-annotated biobank from 78 pts: 51 BM and 38 pBC with eventual BM (11 were matched BC and BM pairs); 59 pts had complete treatment (tx) data. IHC subtype was assigned for BM and pBC: HR+ (hormone receptor)/HER2-, triple-negative (TN; ER-/PR-/HER2-), and HR+or-/HER2+. aBC expression was based on % of positively stained tumor cells: negative (0%), weak (<30%) and strong positive (30%). Overall survival (OS) and survival after BM were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test). Result(s): Median age was 50 yrs (26-84). 67% were Caucasian, 32% African American. 90% received systemic tx for metastatic BC, of which 67% followed BM. 90% received local tx (resection and/or radiation) for BM. There was no difference in receipt of local or systemic tx by aBC. Subtype for pBC (n=36) was 31% (HR+/HER2-), 42% (TN), and 28% (HR+or-/HER2+); for BM (n=42) 33%, 43% and 24%, respectively. aBC was expressed in 37% (14/38) of pBC and 47% (24/51) of BM. Concordance of aBC expression between pBC and BM was 55% (6/11). Gain of aBC expression (4/11) was more common in BM than loss (1/11). aBC was more commonly expressed in TNBC (pBC 73%; BM 67%) compared to HR+/HER2- (pBC 9%; 29% BM) or HR+or-/HER2+ (pBC 0%; 30% BM). OS and survival after BM differed by subtype (all p<0.02); pts with TNBC experienced the poorest outcome. OS and survival after BM was inferior for all pts (n=38) and those with TNBC (n=15) whose pBC expressed aBC (Table). aBC expression within BM was not prognostic (p>0.05). Conclusion(s): aBC expression in BM and pBC with eventual BM is frequent and associated with TNBC. Among pts with BM, expression of aBC in the pBC predicts for inferior OS and survival after BM even among poor prognosis pts with TNBC BM. (Table Presented).",Excluded
1680,"Rapid separation and quantitation of combined neutral and polar lipid classes by high-performance liquid chromatography and evaporative light-scattering mass detection Modifications are described for an innovative and widely used high-performance liquid chromatography technique that resolves a very broad spectrum of lipids for quantitation by evaporative light-scattering detection. Substitution of acetone for 2-propanol in a portion of the solvent gradient program yields consistent resolution of diacylglycerol and cholesterol without sacrificing baseline resolution of the remaining major lipid classes. Moreover, previously noted instabilities in triacylglycerol retention time are eliminated. The introduction of acetone also enables a 20% reduction in flow-rate without an increase in total run time. As a further modification of the mobile phase composition, acetic acid and ethanolamine are substituted for the serine-ethylamine combination that was originally shown to improve column performance. The combination of acetic acid and ethanolamine yields the same result but the increased volatility of these solutes over serine results in decreased baseline noise. Finally, 1,2-hexadecanediol is introduced as an internal standard that is well suited for this method. The chromatographic performance obtained with these modifications is demonstrated in compositional analyses of lipid extracts from rat liver, heart, kidney and brain.",Excluded
2802,"The association between white matter abnormalities and processing speed deficits in bipolar disorder Background: Abnormality of white matter (WM) integrity, as measured by fractional anisotrophy (FA) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), has been observed in bipolar disorder (BD). However, few studies have examined the relationship of FA with cognitive performance in BD. We used DTI to examine regional differences in FA between BD and healthy comparison (HC) participants and the relationship with processing speed and switching abilities within regions of aberrant WM integrity. Method(s): 20 medicated euthymic BD (age=44.6+/-2.1yrs) and 20 HC (age=45.3+/-1.8yrs) participants completed neuropsychological tests of processing speed and switching (D-KEFS Trailmaking) and a 51-direction DTI scan. FA was calculated and tract-based spatial statistics were used to identify common WM tracts. Group differences were examined with independent-samples T-tests. Within significantly different regions, the association of FA with cognitive performance was examined in each group separately. Result(s): BD patients had lower FA within seven WM regions, including clusters in bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and left anterior thalamic radiation, and exhibited mildly slower processing speed. Among BD patients, lower FA values within left inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with slower processing speed. There were no significant associations among HC subjects or for switching performance in either group. Conclusion(s): Consistent with the literature, BD patients demonstrated abnormal WM integrity, primarily in the longitudinal fasciculus, and this deficit was most pronounced among BD patients with the slowest processing speed. These findings suggest that BD processing speed deficits may be due to abnormal WM integrity in the longitudinal fasciculus.",Excluded
2081,"Expression of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 in the rat brain after a single high-dose irradiation Cytokines and growth factors are important regulatory proteins controlling the growth and differentiation of normal and malignant glial cells. In this study, we investigated the expression and origin of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the subacute brain injury after a single high-dose irradiation using 60 Sprague-Dawley rats. The right cerebral hemispheres of rats were exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays using Ir-192. The radiation effect was assessed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks after irradiation, and the results were compared with those in sham operation group. Histological changes characteristic of radiation injury were correlated with the duration after the single dose irradiation. The loss of cortical thickness also increased with the lapse of time after irradiation. The TNF-alpha expression in the irradiated cerebral hemispheres was significantly increased compared with that in the sham operation group. TGF-beta 1 expression was also increased in the irradiated hemispheres. Immunohistochemical study revealed that TGF-beta 1 was expressed predominantly by infiltrating macrophages and astrocytes around the necrotic areas. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 may play prominent roles in the radiation injuries after a single high-dose irradiation.",Included
2454,"Therapeutic effect of pregabalin on radiotherapy-induced trismus in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients AIMS: To evaluate the effect of pregabalin on radiotherapy-induced trismus in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a hospital-based, clinical retrospective cohort study was conducted.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected on patients diagnosed with radiotherapy-induced trismus from March 2014 and March 2016 in the department of neurology in our hospital. Patients in the treatment group were administrated pregabalin for 8 weeks combined with rehabilitation, while the control group only received rehabilitation. The clinical therapeutic effects were observed and evaluated by mandibular motion, severity of trismus measured by late effects of normal tissues/subjective and objective medical analysis (LENT/SOMA) scales, and quality of life (QOL) assessed using the World Health Organization QOL instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) at baseline, week 4 and week 8 during treatment in these two groups, respectively.RESULTS: In the treatment group, the number of patients with improvement on maximal vertical dimension (MVD) was significantly more than controls at week 4 and week 8 (P=0.013, P=0.004, respectively). Moreover, at week 4 and week 8, the severity of trismus was both significantly improved on LENT/SOMA grade in treatment group (P=0.047, P=0.032, respectively). And at week 8, the physical health and the whole life domain of the WHOQOL-BREF score were significantly increased (P=0.037, P=0.034, respectively).

12,"CT perfusion in acute ischemic stroke: a comparison of 2-second and 1-second temporal resolution BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT perfusion data sets are commonly acquired using a temporal resolution of 1 image per second. To limit radiation dose and allow for increased spatial coverage, the reduction of temporal resolution is a possible strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of reduced temporal resolution in CT perfusion scans with regard to color map quality, quantitative perfusion parameters, ischemic lesion extent, and clinical decision-making when using DC and MS algorithms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: CTP datasets from 50 patients with acute stroke were acquired with a TR of 1 second. Two-second TR datasets were created by removing every second image. Various perfusion parameters (CBF, CBV, MTT, TTP, TTD) and color maps were calculated by using identical data-processing settings for 2-second and 1-second TR. Color map quality, quantitative region-of-interest-based perfusion measurements, and TAR/NVT lesions (indicated by CBF/CBV mismatch) derived from the 2-second and 1-second processed data were statistically compared.RESULTS: Color map quality was similar for 2-second versus 1-second TR when using DC and was reduced when using MS. Regarding quantitative values, differences between 2-second and 1-second TR datasets were statistically significant by using both algorithms. Using DC, corresponding tissue-at-risk lesions were slightly smaller at 2-second versus 1-second TR (P < .05), whereas corresponding NVT lesions showed excellent agreement. With MS, corresponding tissue-at-risk lesions showed excellent agreement but more artifacts, whereas NVT lesions were larger (P < .001) compared with 1-second TR. Therapeutic decisions would have remained the same in all patients.CONCLUSIONS: CTP studies obtained with 2-second TR are typically still diagnostic, and the same therapy would have been provided. However, with regard to perfusion quantitation and image-quality-based confidence, our study indicates that 1-second TR is preferable to 2-second TR.",Excluded

At the beginning of the rapid phase of testicular growth and onset of peak gonadotropin secretion (15 days of age), males were treated for 10 days with either short days (10 L:14 D; n = 6), or remained in long days (16 L:8 D; n = 5) and injected each afternoon with melatonin. These treatments arrested testicular growth compared to the gonadal development that occurred in long-day controls (n = 9). Every brain section (60 microns) from the olfactory bulb to the anterior hypothalamus was processed for GnRH immunocytochemistry and viewed under brightfield light microscopy. GnRH cell bodies had smooth contours and were morphologically bipolar or unipolar. The number of bipolar neurons was similar regardless of treatment (about 170/brain). However, fewer unipolar GnRH cell bodies (p less than 0.05) were found in males in short days (73 +/- 11) or in males administered melatonin (72 +/- 14) compared to the unipolar number in hamsters in long days (132 +/- 14). With respect to neuroanatomical distribution, significantly fewer unipolar GnRH neurons were found in the medial preoptic area of males treated with short days or melatonin (55-70% decrease) compared to cell numbers in long-day controls. The melatonin-treated hamsters also had reduced numbers of unipolar GnRH neurons in the diagonal band of Broca relative to the number of unipolar neurons in long-day controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
482,"Radiosurgery of the rat hippocampus: magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological, histological, and behavioral studies OBJECTIVE: To explore the histological, electrophysiological, radiological, and behavioral effects of radiosurgery using a new model of proton beam radiosurgery (PBR) of the rodent hippocampus.METHODS: Forty-one rats underwent PBR of the right hippocampus with nominal doses of 5 to 130 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE). Three control animals were untreated. Three months after PBR, 41 animals were evaluated with the Morris water maze, 23 with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and 22 with intrahippocampal microelectrode recordings. Animals that were studied physiologically were killed, and their brains were examined with Nissl staining and immunocytochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase, heat shock protein 72 (HSP-72), parvalbumin, calmodulin, calretinin, calbindin, and somatostatin.RESULTS: Ninety and 130 CGE resulted in decreased performance in the Morris water maze, increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diminished granule cell field potentials, and tissue necrosis, which was restricted to the irradiated side. These doses also resulted in ipsilateral up-regulation of calbindin and HSP-72. Parvalbumin was down-regulated at 130 CGE. The 30 and 60 CGE animals displayed a marked increase in HSP-72 staining on the irradiated side but no demonstrable cell loss. No asymmetries were noted in somatostatin, calretinin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase staining. Normal physiology was found in rats receiving up to 60 CGE.CONCLUSION: This study expands our understanding of the effects of radiosurgery on the mammalian brain. Three months after PBR, the irradiated rat hippocampus demonstrates necrosis at 90 CGE, but not at 60 CGE, with associated abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging, physiology, and memory testing. HSP-72 was up-regulated at nonnecrotic doses.",Included

384,"Computational models of transcranial direct current stimulation During transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), controllable dose parameters are electrode number (typically 1 anode and 1 cathode), position, size, shape, and applied electric current. Because different electrode montages result in distinct brain current flow patterns across the brain, tDCS dose parameters can be adjusted, in an application-specific manner, to target or avoid specific brain regions. Though the tDCS electrode montage often follows basic rules of thumb (increased/decreased excitability ""under"" the anode/cathode electrode), computational forward models of brain current flow provide more accurate insight into detailed current flow patterns and, in some cases, can even challenge simplified electrode-placement assumptions. With the increased recognized value of computational forward models in informing tDCS montage design and interpretation of results, there have been recent advances in modeling tools and a greater proliferation of publications. In addition, the importance of customizing tDCS for potentially vulnerable populations (eg, skull defects, brain damage/stroke, and extremes of age) can be considered. Finally, computational models can be used to design new electrode montages, for example, to improve spatial targeting such as high-definition tDCS. Pending further validation and dissemination of modeling tools, computational forward models of neuromodulation will become standard tools to guide the optimization of clinical trials and electrotherapy.",Excluded

This study aimed to evaluate the changes after stereotactic radiosurgery for AVMs.METHODS: Nineteen cases with cerebral AVMs had failure after stereotactic radiosurgery therapy. The symptoms and angiography were assessed. All patients underwent microsurgery. Pathologic examination was performed for all cases and electron microscopic examination was carried out in 6 patients.RESULTS: Seven cases had hemorrhage from 12 to 98 months after stereotactic radiosurgery, 5 had headache, 4 had refractory encephalon edema, 2 had epilepsy as a new symptom and 1 had a pressure cyst 5 years after radiosurgery. Angiography in 18 cases, 8 - 98 months after radiation therapy, demonstrated no significant changes in 5 cases, slight reduction in 9, near complete obliteration in 1 and complete obliteration in 3. An abnormal vessel was found on pathologic examination in 17 cases, even one case had obliterated in angiography. Electron microscopy examination showed vessel wall weakness, but the vessels remained open and blood circulated. One case died because of a moribund state before surgery. The other 18 cases had no new neurological deficiencies, seizure control and no hemorrhage occurred after microsurgery at an average follow-up of 3 years.CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiotherapy for AVMs should have a long period follow-up.

To compare both paddles one additional image with RP was made, consisting of either a mediolateral-oblique (MLO) or craniocaudal-view (CC). Pain experience was scored using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Projected breast area was estimated using computer software. Radiation dose was estimated using the model by Dance. Image quality was reviewed by three radiologists and three radiographers.RESULTS: There was no difference in pain experience between both paddles (mean difference NRS: 0.08 +/- 0.08, p = 0.32). Mean radiation dose was 4.5 % lower with FP (0.09 +/- 0.01 p = 0.00). On MLO-images, the projected breast area was 0.79 % larger with FP. Paired evaluation of image quality indicated that FP removed fibroglandular tissue from the image area and reduced contrast in the clinically relevant retroglandular area at chest wall side.CONCLUSIONS: Although FP performed slightly better in the projected breast area, it moved breast tissue from the image area at chest wall side. RP showed better contrast, especially in the retroglandular area. We therefore recommend the use of RP for standard MLO and CC views.",Excluded
90,"The future of intraoperative neuromonitoring in skull base surgery: Intraoperative flash visual evoked potentials a novel technique aiming to reduce the risk of intraoperative visual pathway injury Intraoperative optic nerve/chiasmal injury is one the most devastating unexpected outcomes that may happen to patients undergoing endoscopic skull base surgery. Additionally, one of the main goals for most endoscopic skull base surgery is visual improvement, however currently there is limited ability of intraoperative monitoring for the visual pathway. We examine a novel technique which was developed in our center for monitor the visual pathway intraoperatively using continuous flash visual evoked potentials (FVEPs). The FVEPs provide continuous monitoring of the visual pathway including the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic radiation, and visual cortex, as well as retina function. This technique has been developed at the Ottawa Hospital. Intraoperatively left then right eyes were stimulated by goggle light emitting diode (LED) stimulators (3 LEDs on each side, 640 nm peak wavelength, 10 milliseconds pulse width, 3000mCd of luminous intensity was reflected back on an angle to give uniform illumination across the whole lens, which was placed over the closed eyelids, and recording was obtained from corkscrew electrodes placed at Oz-Fz (2 cm behind Fz). The stimulus rate was 1.41Hz. 150 stimulus presentations were included in a single average. The low cut filter was <=5 Hz and the high cut filter was 100 Hz with amplifier gain 20,000 or 50,000. The total sweep time was 300 milliseconds. EEG was continuously recorded during the surgery from C4-Fz. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. Also any droop in the FVEP will be examined in relation to any intraoperative events. Any transient FVEP amplitude changes which is caused by electrocautery were excluded from the analysis. Thirty patients who had endoscopic skull base surgery had intraoperative VEP using FVEPs in addition to other neurophysiologic monitoring. Patients demographic data, co-morbidities, diagnosis, surgical approach, length of surgery, MAP, and blood loss during surgery were recorded. All patients' visual acuity and field deficits were evaluated by neuro-ophthalmologist prior to their surgery and within 30 days after their surgery. Surgical anesthesia was maintained by TIVA (Propofol/remifentanil infusion). Changes in anesthetic agents and intraoperative events (e.g., sudden blood loss, use of vasopressors .etc) were timed and recorded. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. We found that FVEP is reproducible throughout surgery and can predict the postsurgical outcome.

1836,"Interlayer Repulsion of Retinal Ganglion Cell Mosaics Regulates Spatial Organization of Functional Maps in the Visual Cortex In higher mammals, orientation tuning of neurons is organized into a quasi-periodic pattern in the primary visual cortex. Our previous model studies suggested that the topography of cortical orientation maps may originate from moire interference of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics, but did not account for how the consistent spatial period of maps could be achieved. Here we address this issue with two crucial findings on the development of RGC mosaics: first, homotypic local repulsion between RGCs can develop a long-range hexagonal periodicity. Second, heterotypic interaction restrains the alignment of ON and OFF mosaics, and generates a periodic interference pattern map with consistent spatial frequency. To validate our model, we quantitatively analyzed the RGC mosaics in cat data, and confirmed that the observed retinal mosaics showed evidence of heterotypic interactions, contrary to the previous view that ON and OFF mosaics are developed independently. <b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Orientation map is one of the most studied functional maps in the brain, but it has remained unanswered how the consistent spatial periodicity of maps could be developed. In the current study, we address this issue with our developmental model for the retinal origin of orientation map. We showed that local repulsive interactions between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can develop a hexagonal periodicity in the RGC mosaics and restrict the alignment between ON and OFF mosaics, so that they generate a periodic pattern with consistent spatial frequency for both the RGC mosaics and the cortical orientation maps. Our results demonstrate that the organization of functional maps in visual cortex, including its structural consistency, may be constrained by a retinal blueprint.",Excluded

2703,"Robotics in keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery: A critical review of existing systems and proposed specifications for new robotic platforms BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in image guidance, endoscopy, and tube-shaft instruments have allowed for the further development of keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery, utilizing smaller craniotomies and minimizing exposure and manipulation of unaffected brain tissue. Although such approaches offer the possibility of shorter operating times, reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved longterm outcomes, the technical skills required to perform such surgery are inevitably greater than for traditional open surgical techniques, and they have not been widely adopted by neurosurgeons. Surgical robotics, which has the ability to improve visualization and increase dexterity, therefore has the potential to enhance surgical performance. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the role of surgical robots in keyhole transcranial endoscopeassisted microsurgery. METHOD(S): The technical challenges faced by surgeons utilizing keyhole craniotomies were reviewed, and a thorough appraisal of presently available robotic systems was performed. RESULT(S): Surgical robotic systems have the potential to incorporate advances in augmented reality, stereoendoscopy, and jointed-wrist instruments, and therefore to significantly impact the field of keyhole neurosurgery. To date, over 30 robotic systems have been applied to neurosurgical procedures. The vast majority of these robots are best described as supervisory controlled, and are designed for stereotactic or image-guided surgery. Few telesurgical robots are suitable for keyhole neurosurgical approaches, and none are in widespread clinical use in the field. CONCLUSION(S): New robotic platforms in minimally invasive neurosurgery must possess clear and unambiguous advantages over conventional approaches if they are to achieve significant clinical penetration.

1827,"Toward Improving Patients' Experiences of Acute Toxicity From Breast Radiotherapy: Insights From the Analysis of Patient-Reported Outcomes in a Large Multicenter Cohort PURPOSE: Understanding acute toxicities after whole-breast radiotherapy is important to inform patients, guide treatment decisions, and target supportive care. We evaluated patient-reported outcomes prospectively collected from a cohort of patients with breast cancer.METHODS: We describe the maximal toxicity reported by 8,711 patients treated between 2012 and 2019 at 27 practices. Multivariable models identified characteristics associated with (1) breast pain, (2) bother from itching, stinging/burning, swelling, or hurting of the treated breast, and (3) fatigue within 7 days of completing whole-breast radiotherapy.RESULTS: Moderate or severe breast pain was reported by 3,233 (37.1%): 1,282 (28.9%) of those receiving hypofractionation and 1,951 (45.7%) of those receiving conventional fractionation. Frequent bother from at least one breast symptom was reported by 4,424 (50.8%): 1,833 (41.3%) after hypofractionation and 2,591 (60.7%) after conventional fractionation. Severe fatigue was reported by 2,008 (23.1%): 843 (19.0%) after hypofractionation and 1,165 (27.3%) after conventional fractionation. Among patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy, younger age (P < .001), higher body mass index (BMI; P < .001), Black (P < .001) or other race (P = .002), smoking status (P < .001), larger breast volume (P = .002), lack of chemotherapy receipt (P = .004), receipt of boost treatment (P < .001), and treatment at a nonteaching center predicted breast pain. Among patients receiving conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, younger age (P < .001), higher BMI (P = .003), Black (P < .001) or other race (P = .002), diabetes (P = .001), smoking status (P < .001), and larger breast volume (P < .001) predicted breast pain.CONCLUSION: In this large observational data set, substantial differences existed according to radiotherapy dose fractionation. Race-related differences in pain existed despite controlling for multiple other factors; additional research is needed to understand what drives these differences to target potentially modifiable factors. Intensifying supportive care may be appropriate for subgroups identified as being vulnerable to greater toxicity.",Excluded
1092,"A review on radiogenic Lhermitte's sign Radiation myelopathy is a rare, but extremely serious side-effect of radiotherapy. Recovery from radiation-induced motor sequelae is rare, whereas, the regeneration of sensory losses is relatively frequent. Among the sensory radiogenic injuries of the spinal cord, Lhermitte's sign (LS) is most frequent. This review describes the clinical picture and diagnostic imaging signs of radiogenic LS. There have been only a few studies on large patient groups with radiogenic LS, demonstrating a rate of occurrence of 3.6-13%, relating mainly to mantle irradiation or the radiotherapy of head and neck tumors. These cases typically manifest themselves 3 months following radiotherapy and gradually disappear within 6 months. Only 3 LS cases have been described in the English literature with extraordinarily severe symptoms lasting for more than 1 year. MRI, a sensitive tool in the detection of demyelination, failed to reveal any pathological sign accompanying radiogenic LS. However, positron emission tomography demonstrated increased [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation and [15O]butanol perfusion, but a negligible [11C]methionine uptake in the irradiated spinal cord segments in patients with long-standing LS. These imaging data are suggestive of a close direct relationship between the regional perfusion and metabolism of the spinal cord, very much like the situation in the brain. We postulate that an altered, energy-demanding conduction along the demyelinated axons of patients with chronic radiogenic LS may explain the increased metabolism and perfusion.

2958,"Devastating complications after brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate adenocarcinoma OBJECTIVE: To report a retrospective chart review of patients who developed recto-urethral fistula (RUF) or several bladder neck contracture (BNC) recurrences after brachytherapy for treating localized prostate cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the past 3 years 18 patients with devastating complications after prostate brachytherapy were referred to our centre (RUF in 11, BNC in seven; mean age 63 years, range 60-81). All patients with RUF initially underwent diverting colostomy (six cystoprostatectomy with closure of the fistula, omental interposition and urinary diversion; one prostatectomy, bladder neck closure, fistula closure with omentum flap and continent vesicostomy). Three patients had the fistula closed with gracilis muscle flap using the York-Mason approach (one had a bladder neck closure and suprapubic tube; one elected to have no treatment). All patients with BNC had received three or more procedures to resect or incise their contracture. Four had diversion with a catheterizable segment, two used an indwelling Foley catheter and one uses intermittent catheterization.RESULTS: All six patients who had cystoprostatectomy with urinary diversion have had no recurrence of their RUF. All three treated with the York-Mason procedure healed well. One developed recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma and two a secondary neoplasia in the prostate or rectum (leiomyosarcoma and neuroendocrine, respectively). The enterocystoplasty patient developed sepsis after colostomy reversal and subsequently died. In those patients with BNC, the four who underwent urinary diversion fared well; two tolerate the indwelling catheter poorly, and the seventh uses intermittent catheterization with occasional difficulty.CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy with or without external irradiation can be associated with severe complications. RUF managed with aggressive anterior pelvic exenteration and urinary diversion can be associated with excellent results. The York-Mason procedure in patients with an adequate urinary continence mechanism and bladder dynamics may provide good functional results. The presence of a secondary malignancy in patients deserves further investigation. Many recurrences of a BNC tend be refractory to transurethral resection/incision; indwelling catheters are then poorly tolerated and patients may require a major reconstructive procedure.",Excluded
3552,"Trends in radiotherapeutic management and outcomes in esophageal brain metastases Objective: To examine national practice patterns and survival outcomes in patients with brain metastases from an esophageal primary treated with intracranial radiation. Background(s): Brain metastasis from an esophageal primary are a rare occurrence, therefore clinical data regarding management and outcomes are limited. Intracranial radiotherapy in the form of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common treatment approaches in management of brain metastases, however the utilization patterns and efficacy of each technique in esophageal based brain metastasis are unknown. Design/Methods: We analyzed 289 stage IV esophageal cancer patients with documented brain metastasis treated with intracranial radiotherapy as reported by the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) between the years 2004-2014. The treatment arms included those receiving WBRT versus SRS. Univariable and multivariable analyses identified characteristics predictive of overall survival. Multivariable logistic regression identified co-variates associated with each treatment arm. Result(s): There were 230 patients in the WBRT group and 59 patients in the SRS group. With multivariable analysis, SRS receipt was an independent predictor of improved overall survival (HR=0.63, p=0.005) along with receipt of chemotherapy, lower comorbidity score, African American race, and absence of liver/bone metastases (p<0.01). Overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years for the WBRT was 17% and 4% (median OS: 4.5 months) compared to 32% and 12% (median OS: 6.9 months) for the SRS arm (p=0.004). Notably, patient age, tumor grade, histology, presence of lung metastasis, and sex were not associated with differences in OS. More recent treatment year was associated with receipt of SRS (p=0.03). Conclusion(s): In the largest known analysis of intracranial radiotherapy in esophageal brain metastases to date, receipt of SRS was associated with increased OS compared to WBRT. Given the limitations of a retrospective analysis, these findings require further investigation.",Excluded

Serum proteins, however, were detected immunohistochemically in reactive astrocytes (3 x), in macrophages (2 x) and as diffuse perivascular accumulation. Brain water in the white matter near the implantation site increased from 68.6 to 73.2%, corresponding to a volume increase of about 17%. There was no change in the grey matter or the opposite hemisphere. Cerebral blood flow decreased slightly but there was no relationship with the development of edema.

On day 21 post-plucking, all animals were killed and a portion of the irradiated site was excised. The average hair counts per field in irradiated animals were 85 +/- 4 (6.5 Gy), 25 +/- 5 (8.5 Gy), and 5.5 +/- 0.7 (10 Gy). Animals receiving the prostaglandin systemically had values of 60 +/- 10 (6.5 Gy), 54 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 66 +/- 6 (10 Gy), and 30.1 +/- 8 (12.5 Gy). Topical application of the prostaglandin resulted in protection that yielded 52 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 34 +/- 4 (10 Gy), and 3.2 +/- 0.9 (12.5 Gy) hairs per field.

2049,"Intracranial applications of mr imaging-guided focused ultrasound Initially used in the treatment of prostate cancer and uterine fibroids, the role of focused ultrasound has expanded as transcranial acoustic wave distortion and other limitations have been overcome. Its utility relies on focal energy deposition via acoustic wave propagation.

Thermal ablation via high-intensity continuous exposure generates coagulative necrosis of tissues. High-intensity, pulsed application reduces temporally averaged energy deposition, resulting in mechanical effects, including reversible, localized BBB disruption, which enhances neurotherapeutic agent delivery. While the precise mechanisms remain unclear, low-intensity, pulsed exposures can influence neuronal activity with preservation of cytoarchitecture.

To conclude our studies of neurodegeneration in rat CNS during ACR neurotoxicity, a cupric silver stain method was used to define spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell body, dendrite, axon and terminal argyrophilia in forebrain regions and nuclei. Rats were exposed to ACR at a dose-rate of either 50 mg/kg per day (i.p.) or 21 mg/kg per day (p.o.) and at selected times brains were removed and processed for silver staining. Results show that intoxication at either ACR dose-rate produced a terminalopathy, i.e. nerve terminal degeneration and swelling were present in the absence of significant argyrophilic changes in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites or axons. Exposure to the higher ACR dose-rate caused early onset (day 5), widespread nerve terminal degeneration in most of the major forebrain areas, e.g. cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia. At the lower dose-rate, nerve terminal degeneration in the forebrain developed early (day 7) but exhibited a relatively limited spatial distribution, i.e. anteroventral thalamic nucleus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Several hippocampal regions were affected at a later time point (day 28), i.e. CA1 field and subicular complex. At both dose-rates, argyrophilic changes in forebrain nerve terminals developed prior to the onset of significant gait abnormalities. Thus, in forebrain, ACR intoxication produced a pure terminalopathy that developed prior to the onset of significant neurological changes and progressed as a function of exposure. Neither dose-rate used in this study was associated with axon degeneration in any forebrain region. Our findings indicate that nerve terminals were selectively affected in forebrain areas and, therefore, might be primary sites of ACR action.",Excluded

The spleens of irradiated mice were removed aseptically and the splenocytes were extracted from the individual spleens and cultured. The micronuclei were prepared 72 hours after irradiation in binucleate splenocytes by blocking cytokinesis with cytochalasin-B. Irradiation of mice resulted in a dose-dependent elevation in the micronucleated splenocytes. The exposure of mice not only elevated splenocytes bearing one micronucleus but also cells bearing 2 and multiple (>2) micronuclei indicating induction of complex DNA damage after irradiation. Oral treatment of mice with 50 mg/kg body weight of jamun leaf extract protected against the radiation-induced micronuclei formation. Jamun extract also protected against the formation of 2 and multiple micronuclei indicating repair or inhibition of complex DNA damage. The assessment of lipid peroxidation in mice brain homogenate has indicated a concentration dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation by jamun extract. Studies in a cell free system revealed that jamun extract inhibited the formation of OH, O(2)-, DPPH, and ABTS(+) free radicals in a concentration dependent manner.

1074,"Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy enhances radiation-induced abscopal response in glioblastoma Introduction: Immunotherapy for glioblastoma have been largely unsuccessful, in part, because molecular heterogeneity drives selective elimination of only a subset of tumor cells. Therefore, therapeutic success in patients will require achieving an 'abscopal effect' where following focused radiation therapy, non-targeted tumor cells are attacked by the immune system. It remains unclear how glioblastoma respond to focused radiation in terms of failure location and whether immunotherapy could amplify the immune response to tumor outside the radiation field. Method(s): We evaluated patterns of treatment failure and outcomes in glioblastoma patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; N=47). To optimize the abscopal effect, we developed a genetically-engineered mouse model of bilateral glioblastoma. Here, one side of the mouse brain has a tumor treated by focal radiation and the contralateral untreated tumor is used as a readout of abscopal therapeutic efficacy following anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. Result(s): In glioblastoma patients receiving SRS, increasing age (>60 years) as associated with more 'out of field' treatment failure (P=0.036) and poor survival (P=0.001). In mice, we find that focal radiation of one tumor combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy induced an immunological response against tumor cells outside the radiation field and enhanced survival (P<0.05). Significant macrophage and T-cell infiltration occurred in mesenchymal subtype-like tumors (N=6-8 mice per group, P <0.01). In proneural subtype-like tumors, macrophage infiltration alone was associated with 'out of field' tumor regression (N=8 mice per group, P<0.05). In-vitro, treatment of mouse macrophages with anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced significant gene expression changes and enhanced phagocytosis in an ERK-dependent fashion. All 3 commercially available human anti-PD-L1 antibodies also induced ERK signaling with varying efficacies. Conclusion(s): Focal radiation combined with anti-PD-L1 therapy induces an immunological response to un-irradiated glioblastoma. We are currently optimizing other treatment combinations that could also be readily assessed in phase I human clinical trials.",Excluded
1119,"Environmental enrichment enhances neurogenesis and improves functional outcome after cranial irradiation Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for brain tumors but it can cause delayed progressive cognitive decline and memory deficits. Previous studies suggested that this neurocognitive dysfunction might be linked to the impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, little is known regarding how to reduce the cognitive impairment caused by radiation therapy. To investigate whether environmental enrichment (EE) promotes neurogenesis and cognitive function after irradiation, irradiated gerbils were housed in EE for 2 months and evaluated by neurobehavioral testing for learning and memory function, and immunohistochemical analysis for neurogenesis. Our results demonstrated that even relatively low doses (5-10 Gy) of irradiation could acutely abolish precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus by more than 90%. This reduction in precursor proliferation was persistent and led to a significant decline in the granule cell population 9 months later. EE housing enhanced the number of newborn neurons and increased residual neurogenesis. EE also significantly increased the total number of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, irradiated animals after EE housing showed a significant improvement in spatial learning and memory during the water-maze test and in rotorod motor learning over a 5-day training paradigm. In conclusion, EE has a positive impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and functional recovery in irradiated adult gerbils. Our data suggest that there is still a considerable amount of plasticity remaining in the hippocampal progenitor cells in adult animals after radiation injury, which can become a target of therapeutic intervention for radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction.",Included
1789,"Effects of 14 days of spaceflight and nine days of recovery on cell body size and succinate dehydrogenase activity of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons The cross-sectional areas and succinate dehydrogenase activities of L5 dorsal root ganglion neurons in rats were determined after 14 days of spaceflight and after nine days of recovery. The mean and distribution of the cross-sectional areas were similar to age-matched, ground-based controls for both the spaceflight and for the spaceflight plus recovery groups. The mean succinate dehydrogenase activity was significantly lower in spaceflight compared to aged-matched control rats, whereas the mean succinate dehydrogenase activity was similar in age-matched control and spaceflight plus recovery rats. The mean succinate dehydrogenase activity of neurons with cross-sectional areas between 1000 and 2000 microns2 was lower (between 7 and 10%) in both the spaceflight and the spaceflight plus recovery groups compared to the appropriate control groups. The reduction in the oxidative capacity of a subpopulation of sensory neurons having relatively large cross-sectional areas immediately following spaceflight and the sustained depression for nine days after returning to 1 g suggest that the 0 g environment induced significant alterations in proprioceptive function.",Included
1629,"Characterization of Na+-activated K+ currents in larval lamprey spinal cord neurons Potassium channels play an important role in controlling neuronal firing and synaptic interactions. Na(+)-activated K(+) (K(Na)) channels have been shown to exist in neurons in different regions of the CNS, but their physiological function has been difficult to assess. In this study, we have examined if neurons in the spinal cord possess K(Na) currents. We used whole cell recordings from isolated spinal cord neurons in lamprey. These neurons display two different K(Na) currents. The first was transient and activated by the Na(+) influx during the action potentials, and it was abolished when Na(+) channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin. The second K(Na) current was sustained and persisted in tetrodotoxin. Both K(Na) currents were abolished when Na(+) was substituted with choline or N-methyl-D-glucamine, indicating that they are indeed dependent on Na(+) influx into neurons. When Na(+) was substituted with Li(+), the amplitude of the inward current was unchanged, whereas the transient K(Na) current was reduced but not abolished. This suggests that the transient K(Na) current is partially activated by Li(+). These two K(Na) currents have different roles in controlling the action potential waveform. The transient K(Na) appears to act as a negative feedback mechanism sensing the Na(+) influx underlying the action potential and may thus be critical for setting the amplitude and duration of the action potential. The sustained K(Na) current has a slow kinetic of activation and may underlie the slow Ca(2+)-independent afterhyperpolarization mediated by repetitive firing in lamprey spinal cord neurons.",Excluded

330,"[Neuroradiological response criteria for malignant gliomas] This article summarizes the new response criteria of the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group and the clinical implications. The RANO criteria represent an important step forward in the accurate assessment of response to therapy in patients with malignant gliomas, not only in clinical trials but also in daily practice. The introduction of new substances to glioma therapy, such as antiangiogenic drugs, has complicated the assessment of efficacy by MRI due to profound effects on the vascular biology of these tumors. Moreover new treatment modalities have increased the incidence and awareness of imaging phenomena, such as pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse, not only within clinical trials but also outside. In addition to MRI the new RANO criteria also take clinical parameters, such as steroid medication and neurological symptoms, into account. Thus both neuroradiologists and neurologists/neurooncologists need to be aware of and experienced in applying these criteria when treating patients with malignant gliomas to be able to correctly assess the response to therapy.",Excluded
3261,"Time resolved dosimetry of human brain exposed to low frequency pulsed magnetic fields An accurate dosimetry is a key issue to understanding brain stimulation and related interaction mechanisms with neuronal tissues at the basis of the increasing amount of literature revealing the effects on human brain induced by low-level, low frequency pulsed magnetic fields (PMFs). Most literature on brain dosimetry estimates the maximum E field value reached inside the tissue without considering its time pattern or tissue dispersivity. Nevertheless a time-resolved dosimetry, accounting for dispersive tissues behavior, becomes necessary considering that the threshold for an effect onset may vary depending on the pulse waveform and that tissues may filter the applied stimulatory fields altering the predicted stimulatory waveform's size and shape. In this paper a time-resolved dosimetry has been applied on a realistic brain model exposed to the signal presented in Capone et al (2009 J. Neural Transm. 116 257-65), accounting for the broadband dispersivity of brain tissues up to several kHz, to accurately reconstruct electric field and current density waveforms inside different brain tissues. The results obtained by exposing the Duke's brain model to this PMF signal show that the E peak in the brain is considerably underestimated if a simple monochromatic dosimetry is carried out at the pulse repetition frequency of 75 Hz.",Excluded

CNS relapse occurred in 30-50% of those with Burkitt lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma prior to the introduction of intensified regimens that include CNS prophylaxis. Most patients with AIDS-related-lymphoma receive a short course of intrathecal prophylaxis but a re-evaluation of type and targeting of CNS prophylaxis is needed. Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have a 5% overall risk of CNS relapse but a high risk sub-population can be identified on the basis of raised LDH and >1 extranodal site, testicular or primary breast involvement. CNS prophylaxis for selected patients with DLBCL may be justified by risk but its benefit is not yet proven.

2742,"Oligodendroglioma Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the standard treatment modalities for all primary brain tumors. Oligodendroglial tumors are uncommon primary brain tumors that typically are classified as low-grade or anaplastic based on their histologic appearance. A great deal of controversy has surrounded the diagnosis of an oligodendroglioma because no unique immunohistochemical marker exists to diagnose this tumor, forcing pathologists to render a diagnosis based on subjective microscopic features. Although once considered relatively rare, oligodendroglial tumors have been increasing in incidence because pathologists have become less rigorous about this diagnosis. However, recent advances in our understanding of the molecular genetic changes associated with brain tumors have identified loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p and 19q as a unique genetic signature of most oligodendroglial tumors, an advance that has paved the way for pathologists to use molecular diagnostics to identify these tumors with improved reliability. These genetic derangements have significant clinical and therapeutic implications because they have been associated with a predictable and durable response to treatment, particularly chemotherapy, and an improved prognosis. The unique chemosensitivity of oligodendroglial tumors has been recognized by neurooncologists for at least 15 years, and various chemotherapeutic agents have been used to manage these diseases. However, the appropriate timing of chemotherapy, and the drugs of choice remain controversial. Increasingly, neurooncologists are reluctant to use radiotherapy as initial management for these diseases because of concerns surrounding the late neurocognitive sequelae of cranial irradiation. These toxicities are particularly important for patients with low-grade oligodendrogliomas in whom the prognosis often exceeds 10 years. Consequently, with the accumulating evidence supporting the chemosensitivity of low-grade and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and the recent ability to use molecular diagnostics to identify a chemosensitive subset af oligodendrogliomas, neurooncologists are increasingly administering chemotherapy as the initial intervention for all oligodendroglial tumors that harbor favorable genetic derangements. Additionally, although immediate post-operative treatment is uniformly administered to patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, there has been an increasing tendency to defer definitive therapy for those with low-grade oligodendrogliomas until evidence of progression. The development of temozolomide, an oral and well-tolerated alkylating agent that has activity against oligodendroglial tumors, has accelerated this trend to the extent that currently many patients with newly diagnosed low-grade and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas are offered this drug as initial treatment. This paper reviews the current management of oligodendrogliomas, with an emphasis on the expanding role of chemotherapy for these neoplasms. Copyright Â© 2005 by Current Science Inc.",Excluded

Mean age was 63 years (standard deviation 12.1) and 56% were women. The radiotherapy fields were breast (35%), abdomen/pelvis (15%), prostate/bladder (21%), head/neck (10%) and other (8%).KEY RESULTS: The patients experiencing nausea within the observed week (n=31) had, compared to the patients not experiencing nausea (n=100), lower ability in daily activities in general (p=0.001), in shopping (p=0.014), walking (p=0.007) and social interaction (p=0.007). Of the patients with nausea 48% had seldom woken up rested and 34% were not able to eat as much as they used to. Corresponding figures for nausea free patients were 27% (not significant; ns) and 16% (ns). Six (5%) experienced vomiting, 15 (12%) diarrhoea, 23 (18%) constipation and 52 (40%) any gastrointestinal symptoms. Forty seven (90%) were negatively bothered by the experienced gastrointestinal symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: The fourth of patients experiencing nausea during radiotherapy had lower ability to perform daily activities than the three quarters of patients who were free from nausea. Few patients vomited while 40% experienced gastrointestinal symptoms during the observed week of radiotherapy. This implies that health care professionals could consider identifying nauseous patients that possibly need support in nausea-reduction and in daily activities during radiotherapy.",Excluded

The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K+ conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow after hyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 (5 microM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow after hyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca(2+)-spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow after hyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca2+ entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors.",Excluded

We assessed relationships between BMI, physician's preference of functional test, test positivity, and results of invasive coronary angiography (Cath) using logistic regression models.RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of the patients had BMI>=30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 20% had BMI>=35. Providers were more likely to prefer nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) over other functional tests as BMI increased. The rate of test positivity with coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was not different (10% vs. 12%) in patients with BMI >=35 vs. < 35. The same was true for stress echocardiogram and stress electrocardiogram (positivity 8-13%, P>0.8 for both). In contrast, MPI was significantly more likely to be positive in those with BMI >=35 vs. <35 (18% vs. 13%; P=0.001).

The world's first mobile electron linear accelerator (Mobetron) has changed the way cancer patients are treated.1 This study is designed to test the anaesthetic management of patients receiving a combination of extensive surgery and intraoperative radiation using the Mobetron combined with remote monitoring. Safety and effectiveness of the Mobetron will also be assessed. Our initial study was to analyse the difference between patients who underwent surgery with and without IORT using the Mobetron. A further study was designed to assess neutron leakage measurements around the target tumour bed with a semi-conducting electrode. Twenty-four patients with locally advanced primary or locally recurrent cancer were recruited into this prospective study and were randomly assigned into the Mobetron group (n=12) and the control group (n=12). General anaesthesia was delivered during surgery. Narcotrend measurements for depth of anaesthesia and noxious stimulation were made. Radiation was delivered directly to the tumour bed or target section with the use of the Mobetron immediately after surgey (resection/laparotomy). The dose rate around the target tumour bed or target section was assessed with a semi-conducting electrode. During the 2 min of intraoperative radiation therapy, patients and monitors were observed via closed-circuit camera.2 No serious complications related to anaesthesia (cardiac failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, and cerebral dysfunction) occurred. The level of anaesthesia, recovery time, intraoperative haemorrhage, blood transfusion, urinary output, crystalloid and colloid infusion, lowest temperature, SpO2 (%), E'CO<inf>2</inf>, were similar in two groups. The addition of radiotherapy extends the total time of anaesthesia by 20-30 min. The dose rate at the region around target is much lower than the target (0.11 Gy min<sup>-1</sup> vs 1.17 Gy min<sup>-1</sup>). The majority of patients were stable (haemodynamic and respiratory) enough to be discharged from the ICU to the ward within 3 days. Adequate preoperative assessment and preparation, reasonable anaesthesia management with the help of adequate remote monitoring, and effective multidisciplinary (Table Presented) communication all contribute to make IORT procedures feasible and safe. IORT has allowed a selective treatment approach to locally advanced primary and recurrent neoplasm which traditionally would have been deemed unresectable.

New real time radiation monitoring systems provide an opportunity for workers to immediately identify and alter problematic behaviors in the neuroangiography suite, decreasing unnecessary exposures, lowering risk, and maximizing safety efforts.METHODS: Real time radiation monitoring was performed for 120 diagnostic cerebral angiography procedures. Data were collected in two phases, for procedures performed by two physician participants (30 procedures per physician per phase). Workers were blinded to their real time dose in phase I, and unblinded in phase II. Individual exposures (Sv) and the incidence of red events (exposure rates >=2.0 mSv/h) were collected for each assigned participating role (physician A, physician B, nurse, scrubbed technologist, and circulating technologist). The dose area product was collected for each procedure to standardize against variations in procedure duration or intensity.RESULTS: In phase II, significant decreased radiation exposure was observed for all roles except physician A. Physician B decreased most from 24.3x10(-8) to 6.9x10(-8) Sv/Gy-cm(2) (p<0.0001).

By the final examination, the visual acuity of 26 patients (66.7%) was better than 20/200, and 12 patients (30.7%) had a visual acuity better than 20/40. Retinopathy was detected in 11 patients (28.2%). After treatments only one patient (5.1%) had active vascular changes by the last examination. Moderate optic neuropathy was observed in 4 patients (10.3%). Cataract development was diagnosed in 21 patients (53.8%), and 16 patients (41%) had bilateral cataract development. Special emphasis was made on patients with larger tumors. Twelve out of the 39 patients had a tumor with a depth of 5 mm or more. There was no significant difference in local control or in side effects between both groups observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our study proved <sup>106</sup>Ru -brachytherapy to be an excellent treatment option with regard to tumor control and preservation of the visual acuity in well-selected patients.

The total absorbed radiation doses were equal to or less than 57 cGy. Observed changes in the FTIR spectra represent the damage in the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of nucleic acid, which seem to be connected with modification of bases and sugars, and redistribution of the H-bond network. FTIR data for tumour and gamma-irradiated nucleic acid show some similar features.

3216,"CT evaluation of patient deep inspiration self-breath-holding: how precisely can patients reproduce the tumor position in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices? The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reproducibility of tumor position under patient deep inspiration self-breath-holding in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices, as well as to compare the reproducibility of deep inspiration self-breath-holding on the verbal command of a radiation technologist (Passive mode) with that initiated by patients' own estimation (Active mode). Twenty patients with lung cancer were shown how the tumor and diaphragm move during the respiration cycle. Patients were instructed to hold their breath during deep inspiration and reproduce identical tumor position as well as possible either by the Active mode or by the Passive mode. After patients had practiced self-breath-holding during deep inspiration, a set of three CT scans was obtained for each of the two modes of self-breath-holding (6 CT scans total) to obtain randomly timed images of 2 mm thickness in the vicinity of the tumor. The first three scans were performed during breath-hold using the Active mode, and next three scans were using the Passive mode. Maximum difference in tumor position for the three CT scans was then calculated along three axes: cranial-caudal (C-C); anterior-posterior (A-P); and right-left (R-L). In the 20 patients who underwent analysis of self-breath-holding, mean maximum difference in tumor position obtained under breath-hold using the Active and the Passive modes were: 2.2 and 3.1 mm along the C-C axis; 1.4 and 2.4 mm along the A-P axis; and 1.3 and 2.2 mm along the R-L axis, respectively. These differences in all axes were significantly smaller (p<0.05) for the Active mode than for the Passive mode. Most tumors displayed maximal respiratory movement along the C-C axis, and minimal movement along the R-L axis, but tumors located in the upper lung displayed maximal movement along the A-P axis. Significant correlation (p<0.05) was observed between differences along three axes in either mode of breath-hold. In conclusion, the reproducibility of tumor position under self-breath-holding by patients during deep inspiration after sufficient practice and in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices was satisfactorily accurate, and differences in tumor position were smaller under breath-holding using the Active mode than using the Passive mode. We believe this new technique is likely to prove extremely useful for the irradiation of lung tumors with a small internal margin and for reduced proportion of high-dose irradiated normal lung to total lung volume.",Excluded
3486,"Low-Dose and Limited-Volume Radiotherapy Alone for Primary Dural Marginal Zone Lymphoma: Treatment Approach and Review of Published Data Purpose: Primary dural lymphoma is a rare intracranial lymphoma that almost always has a marginal zone histologic type and immunophenotype and often remains localized and is thus potentially curable with radiotherapy (RT) alone. The unusual location and histologic type of primary dural marginal zone lymphoma (PDMZL) distinguish it from primary central nervous system lymphoma and poses treatment dilemmas of technique, volume, and dose that have not been well addressed. We set out to analyze our recent experience in treating PDMZL and reviewed the limited published data available. Methods and Materials: Between 2002 and 2006, we treated 5 patients with localized PDMZL. Of these 5 patients, 3 had unilateral and 2 had bilateral/multifocal involvement, and 3 underwent subtotal tumor resection and 2 biopsy only. Whole brain RT was given before involved-field RT (IFRT) in 4 patients and 1 received IFRT alone. The median whole brain RT, IFRT, and total RT dose was 20, 12, and 30 Gy, respectively. The planning computed tomography scan was always fused with the post-gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging scan to assist in the IFRT volume determination. We also analyzed the published data from 27 additional patients. Result(s): The median follow-up was 34 months (range, 31-52). All obtained lasting local control. One patient developed a relapse in the soft tissue of the flank and additional systemic progression but no central nervous system recurrence. At last follow-up, no significant treatment-related neurotoxicity was detected. Conclusion(s): The results of our study have demonstrated that a combination of whole brain RT/IFRT or even low-dose IFRT alone provides excellent durable local control of PDMZL. This approach is potentially curative, possibly without significant neurotoxicity. Additional study and longer follow-up are needed to determine the appropriate RT dose and volume parameters for this rare, debilitating, and yet potentially curable lymphoma. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc.

939,"Muscles in microgravity: from fibres to human motion In simulated or actual microgravity, human and animal postural muscles undergo substantial atrophy: after about 270 days, the muscle mass attains a constant value of about 70% of the initial one. Most animal studies reported preferential atrophy of slow twitch fibres whose mechanical properties change towards the fast type. However, in humans, at the end of a 42-days bed rest study, a similar atrophy of slow and fast fibres was observed. After microgravity, the maximal force of several muscle groups showed a substantial decrease (6-25% of pre-flight values). The maximal power during very short ""explosive"" efforts of 0.25-0.30s showed an even greater fall, being reduced to 65% after 1 month and to 45% (of pre-flight values) after 6 months. The maximal power developed during 6-7s ""all-out"" bouts on an isokinetic cycloergometer was reduced to a lesser extent, attaining about 75% of pre-flight values, regardless of the flight duration. In these same subjects, the muscle mass of the lower limbs declined by only 9-13%. Thus, a substantial fraction of the observed decreases of maximal power is probably due to a deterioration of the motor co-ordination brought about by the absence of gravity. To prevent this substantial decay of maximal absolute power, we propose that explosive exercise be added to the daily in-flight training schedule. We also describe a system aimed at reducing cardiovascular deconditioning wherein gravity is simulated by the centrifugal acceleration generated by the motion of two counter rotating bicycles ridden by the astronauts on the inner wall of a cylindrical space module. Finally, cycling on circular or elliptical tracks may be useful to reduce cardiovascular deconditioning in permanently manned lunar bases. Indeed, on the curved parts of the path, a cyclist generates an outward acceleration vector (ac). To counterbalance ac, the cyclist must lean inwards, so that the vectorial sum of ac plus the lunar gravity tends to the acceleration of gravity prevailing on Earth.",Excluded
399,"Impairment of cerebral blood flow regulation in astronauts with orthostatic intolerance after flight BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated cerebral blood flow regulation in astronauts before and after flights. We hypothesized that autoregulation would be different before flight and after flight between nonfinishers and the finishers of a stand test.METHODS: Twenty-seven astronauts from shuttle missions lasting 8 to 16 days underwent a 10-minute stand test: 10 days before flight, 1 to 2 hours and 3 days after landing. Mean blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was measured using transcranial Doppler; Mean arterial pressure was measured using a Finapres (Ohmeda, Englewood, CO) and was adjusted to the level of the MCA (BP(MCA)). Cross-spectral power, gain, phase, and coherence were determined for the relation between BP(MCA) and the cerebrovascular resistance index mean blood flow velocity/BP(MCA).RESULTS: BP(MCA) was reduced with stand (P<0.001). Differences between finishers and nonfinishers (P=0.011) and over test days (P=0.004) were observed. Cerebrovascular conductance was affected by stand (P<0.001), by group (P<0.001) with a group by stand, and test day interaction (P<0.01). Preflight data suggest that the nonfinishers were operating at a higher cerebral vasodilation than finishers for a given BP(MCA), and on landing day the nonfinishers had a greater decrease in mean blood flow velocity as a function of BP(MCA) with standing compared to finishers and preflight. There was a significant interaction effect of gender over the test days and from supine to stand (P=0.035).CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the cause of presyncope in astronauts may be related to a mismatch of cerebral blood flow with blood pressure. Astronaut gender may also play a role in susceptibility to orthostatic intolerance after flight.",Excluded
2949,"Regulation of prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> synthesis after brain irradiation Purpose: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> (PGE <inf>2</inf>) levels seen after radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE <inf>2</inf> production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE<inf>2</inf> production and PGES expression. Result(s): As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE<inf>2</inf> levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE<inf>2</inf> seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls. Conclusion(s): Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE<inf>2</inf> production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities.

1761,The effect of laser hemotherapy on the acid glycosaminoglycan content of the liver and blood plasma in rats in the dynamics of an alcoholic coma. [Russian] The aim of the study was determination of the content of acid glycosaminoglicans (GAG) in hepatic tissue and blood plasma of rats in the course of alcoholic coma and in response to laser irradiation of venous blood. The alcoholic intoxication was achieved by introduction of 40% ethanol through a metal probe into the stomach. The content of acid GAG was defined according to Diche. Alcoholic coma caused reduction of GAG levels in hepatic tissue and an increase in blood plasma which were correlated with the severity of neurological state. Laser irradiation of venous blood promoted a trend to normalization of GAG content in the investigated tissues. A relative reduction in GAG plasma levels after laser hemotherapy indicates effectiveness of the conducted therapy.,Excluded

3315,"Comparing radiation therapy and ipilimumab to ipilimumab alone in metastatic melanoma patients Purpose/Objective: With evidence suggesting ipilimumab and intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) improves survival compared to SRS alone, we compared toxicity, response rates (RRs), and outcomes of metastatic melanoma patients receiving radiation (RT) and ipilimumab to ipilimumab alone. Methods and Materials: We reviewed records of metastatic melanoma patients receiving ipilimumab 3mg/kg between 2010-2014. RRs, measured by immune RECIST criteria, and toxicity were compared by Fischer's exact text. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method. Result(s): 61 patients received ipilimumab, with 35 (57.4%) also receiving radiation within 4 months of ipilimumab. The radiation cohort was similar at baseline except for greater systemic burden of disease (82.9% vs. 42.3%, p = 0.005), higher dexamethasone use (14.3% vs. 0%, p = 0.048), and more brain involvement (74.3% vs. 0% p<0.001). 92.3% of brain metastases received SRS. Grade 3 toxicity was not statistically different between cohorts (5.9% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.113); one grade 4 was experienced (1.6%), while no grade 5 occurred. While the ipilimumab alone group demonstrated a trend toward higher 1-year OS (49.4% vs. 73.2%, p = 0.090), the cohort did not have any patients with brain metastases; therefore, comparing only patients with extra-cranial metastases, 1-year OS was similar (76.2% vs. 73.2%, p = 0.587). RR between both cohorts was similar (20.0% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.494). Pre-ipilimumab absolute lymphocyte count greater than 1000 was the only significant predictor for increased RR in multivariable analysis (Odds Ratio: 8.56, 95% CI: 1.82-40.42; p = 0.007). Comparing 2-5 fractions of radiation to ipilimumab alone demonstrated a trend towards higher response rate (42.9% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.074). Conclusion(s): Despite poorer prognostic characteristics in the RT with ipilimumab cohort, toxicity, RR and OS were similar between the arms. Prospective studies investigating the ideal radiation fractionation to improve ipilimumab response rates are warranted.

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy using the somatostatin analogue [177Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate is a convincing treatment modality for metastasized neuroendocrine tumors. Therapeutic doses are administered in 4 cycles with 6-10 week intervals. A high somatostatin receptor density on tumor cells is a prerequisite at every administration to enable effective therapy. In this study, the density of the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) was investigated in the rat CA20948 pancreatic tumor model after low dose [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate administration resulting in approximately 20 Gy tumor radiation absorbed dose, whereas 60 Gy is needed to induce complete tumor regression in these and the majority of tumors. Methods. Sixteen days after inoculation of the CA20948 tumor, male Lewis rats were injected with 185 MBq [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate to initiate a decline in tumor size. Approximately 40 days after injection, tumors re-grew progressively after initial response. Quantification of sst2 expression was performed using in vitro autoradiography on frozen sections of three groups: control (not-treated) tumors, tumors in regression and tumors in re-growth. Histology and proliferation were determined using HE- and anti-Ki-67-staining. Results. The sst2 expression on CA20948 tumor cells decreased significantly after therapy to 5% of control level. However, tumors escaping from therapy showed an up-regulated sst2 level of 2-5 times higher sst2 density compared to control tumors. Conclusion. After a suboptimal therapeutic dose of [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>] octreotate, escape of tumors is likely to occur. Since these cells show an up-regulated sst2 receptor density, a next therapeutic administration of radio-labelled sst2 analogue can be expected to be highly effective.",Excluded

Method(s): Thirteen consecutive patients with brain metastases from UCC were managed with a Leksell gamma-knife at our institution between January 2003 and December 2010. Clinical features and radiosurgical outcomes of patients were analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): Gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS) was chosen as the only treatment in four patients and performed in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in nine patients. GKRS was conducted simultaneously with WBRT within a 1-month interval in six patients and was chosen as the salvage treatment after WBRT in three patients. The mean number of metastatic brain lesions per patient was 5.7 (range, 1-16). The median cumulative tumor volume was 23.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 2.7-40.2 cm<sup>3</sup>), and the median marginal dose covering the tumors was 14 Gy of a 50 % isodose line (range, 8-25 Gy).

2919,"Anatomically consistent CNN-based segmentation of organs-at-risk in cranial radiotherapy Planning of radiotherapy involves accurate segmentation of a large number of organs at risk (OAR), i.e., organs for which irradiation doses should be minimized to avoid important side effects of the therapy. We propose a deep learning method for segmentation of OAR inside the head, from magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Our system performs segmentation of eight structures: eye, lens, optic nerve, optic chiasm, pituitary gland, hippocampus, brainstem, and brain. We propose an efficient algorithm to train neural networks for an end-to-end segmentation of multiple and nonexclusive classes, addressing problems related to computational costs and missing ground truth segmentations for a subset of classes. We enforce anatomical consistency of the result in a postprocessing step. In particular, we introduce a graph-based algorithm for segmentation of the optic nerves, enforcing the connectivity between the eyes and the optic chiasm. We report cross-validated quantitative results on a database of 44 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRIs with provided segmentations of the considered OAR, which were originally used for radiotherapy planning. In addition, the segmentations produced by our model on an independent test set of 50 MRIs were evaluated by an experienced radiotherapist in order to qualitatively assess their accuracy.

2067,"Effect of tumor treating fields on cell proliferation and synergistic antitumor efficacy in combination with ionizing radiation Alternating electric fields at an intermediate frequency (100~300 kHz), called tumor treating fields (TTFs), are reported to interrupt the process of mitosis via apoptosis and to act as an inhibitor of cell proliferation. Although the presence of an antimitotic effect of TTFs has been widely reported, the efficacy of TTFs is still controversial issue among medical experts. To resolve this controversial issue, the comparison study between the effects of TTFs and the effect of other conventional cancer treatment techniques need to be carried out. In this study, experimental evidence of the synergistic antimitotic effect of TTFs in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) is reported. For these experiments, aggressive brain cancer cells, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (U373 and U87), were treated either with TTFs alone, with IR alone or with TTFs followed by ionizing radiation (IR). The percentages of cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and mitotic abnormalities were increased by the application of TTFs alone and its quantity was markedly increased when TTFs were combined with IR. Our results also suggested that radiotherapy together with TTFs may be clinically beneficial since the combination treatment seemed to synergistically suppress both cell migration and invasion, based on the inhibition of MMP-9 and vimentin.",Excluded
2955,"Inactivation and block of calcium channels by photo-released Ca2+ in dorsal root ganglion neurons Calcium channels are inactivated by voltage and intracellular calcium. To study the kinetics and the mechanism of calcium-induced inactivation of calcium channels, a ""caged"" calcium compound, dimethoxy-nitrophen was used to photo-release about 50 microM calcium ion within 0.2 millisecond in dorsal root ganglion neurons. When divalent cations were the charge carriers, intracellular photo-release of calcium inactivated the calcium channel with an invariant rate [time constant (tau) approximately equal to 7 milliseconds]. When the monovalent cation sodium was the charge carrier, photorelease of calcium inside or outside of the cell blocked the channel rapidly (tau approximately equal to 0.4 millisecond), but the block was greater from the external side. Thus the kinetics of calcium-induced calcium channel inactivation depends on the valency of the permeant cation. The data imply that calcium channels exist in either of two conformational states, the calcium- and sodium-permeant forms, or, alternatively, calcium-induced inactivation occurs at a site closely associated with the internal permeating site.",Excluded

In congenitally deaf mice, ""auditory cortex"" contained neurons that responded to somatosensory, visual, or both somatosensory and visual stimulation; the primary visual area contained a larger proportion of neurons that responded to somatosensory stimulation than in normal animals, and the primary visual area had significantly increased in size.

The new advancements are mostly in modeling of operator knowledge-based behavior in accident conditions, enhancing realism of the IDAC model, and simulation approach to Human Reliability Analysis (HRA). The focus is situation assessment and diagnosis of the accident cause. Knowledge-based reasoning plays an important role in this phase. A reasoning module has been developed and implemented in ADS-IDAC to simulate operators' knowledge-based reasoning. This paper describes the cognitive architecture of the reasoning module, including knowledge representation (model of operator's understanding of the plant systems and functions), a memory representation, information processing flow, reasoning sequence generation, and rules for accident diagnosis. Some theoretical and empirical insights for human error prediction are embedded in this causal model as simulation rules. Human cognitive limitations and heuristics that potentially contribute to human errors are explicitly modeled. Together with the model description, several example simulations are provided to demonstrate different features of the reasoning module. Examples of the simulation show that the reasoning module in ADS-IDAC produces realistic knowledge-based responses by capturing cognitive limitations, deliberative reasoning, and dynamic of accident progression.

1898,"Central infusion of the melanocortin receptor antagonist agouti-related peptide (AgRP(83-132)) prevents cachexia-related symptoms induced by radiation and colon-26 tumors in mice Cachexia is a clinical wasting syndrome that occurs in multiple disease states, and is associated with anorexia and a progressive loss of body fat and lean mass. The development of new therapeutics for this disorder is needed due to poor efficacy and multiple side effects of current therapies. The pivotal role played by the central melanocortin system in regulating body weight has made this an attractive target for novel cachexia therapies. The mixed melanocortin receptor antagonist AgRP is an endogenous peptide that induces hyperphagia. Here, we used AgRP(83-132) to investigate the ability of melanocortin antagonism to protect against clinical features of cachexia in two distinct animal models. In an acute model, food intake and body weight gain were reduced in mice exposed to radiation (300 RAD), and delivery of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral cerebral ventricle prevented these effects. In a chronic tumor cachexia model, adult mice were injected subcutaneously with a cell line derived from murine colon-26 adenocarcinoma. Typical of cachexia, tumor-bearing mice progressively reduced body weight and food intake, and gained significantly less muscle mass than controls. Administration of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral ventricles significantly increased body weight and food intake, and changes in muscle mass were similar to the tumor-free control mice. These findings support the idea that antagonism of the central melanocortin system can reduce the negative impact of cachexia and radiation therapy. Â© 2006 Elsevier Inc.

2106,"Overuse of Head CT Examinations for the Investigation of Minor Head Trauma: Analysis of Contributing Factors Purpose The aim of this study was to estimate the amount of CT studies performed in the emergency department of a tertiary hospital that are not indicated by Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHR) guidelines and to analyze factors that contribute to unnecessary examinations. Methods A total of 955 brain CT examinations performed for minor head injuries were randomly retrospectively selected. Medical records were assessed for the following parameters: demographics, cause of head trauma, and referring physician's seniority and specialty. For each CT scan, it was determined whether the CT referral met the CCHR criteria. The CT interpretations of patients under 65 years of age were evaluated to assess the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the CCHR criteria. Results A total of 104 examinations (10.9%) were not indicated according to the CCHR, but in patients younger than 65 years, 104 of 279 examinations (37.3%) were not indicated. Neurologists conducted more unwarranted CT studies (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; P = .011), whereas surgeons tended to order fewer studies (OR, 0.676; P = .126). There was no statistically significant difference between the seniority of the referring physician and over-referral (P = .181). Four-wheel motor vehicle accidents (OR, 2.789; P = .001) and a hit on the head by an object (OR, 2.843; P = .006) were associated with a higher rate of nonindicated CT examinations. The CCHR had sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% for either brain hemorrhage or fractures. Conclusions Overuse of CT examinations for minor head injuries was demonstrated, especially in young patients, with an excess of 37.3%. Contributing factors are referring physician specialty and injury mechanism. Analysis of overuse causes can be implemented for education programs and for computerized referring protocols.

2763,"Serotonergic modulation of psychological stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampal CA1 field In order to elucidate possible involvement of the serotonergic neuronal system in the stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity, the effects of contextual fear conditioning (CFC) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 field were examined in 5-HT-depleted rats by pretreatment with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, 200 microg/rat, i.c.v.). LTP induction was suppressed by footshock (FS) stimulation in 5-HT-lesioned rats and vehicle-treated controls. When rats were exposed to CFC, which was received 24 h after FS stimulation, LTP was also blocked in both-treated groups. CFC-induced impairment of LTP, however, significantly attenuated in 5-HT-lesioned rats when compared with that in controls. Fear-related freezing behavior after FS stimulation occurred similarly in both treated groups, whereas the behavior observed during exposure to CFC significantly reduced in 5-HT-lesioned rats. These results suggest that the serotonergic mechanism is involved in the psychological stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity, which appears to be associated with fear-related behavior.",Excluded
831,"Optimised GMP-compliant production of [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 on the Trasis AllinOne module Background: The translocator protein 18 kDa is recognised as an important biomarker for neuroinflammation due to its soaring expression in microglia. This process is common for various neurological disorders. DPA-714 is a potent TSPO-specific ligand which found its use in Positron Emission Tomography following substitution of fluorine-19 with fluorine-18, a positron-emitting radionuclide. [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 enables visualisation of inflammatory processes in vivo non-invasively. Radiolabelling of this tracer is well described in literature, including validation for clinical use. Here, we report significant enhancements to the process which resulted in the design of a fully GMP-compliant robust synthesis of [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 on a popular cassette-based system, Trasis AllinOne, boosting reliability, throughput, and introducing a significant degree of simplicity. Result(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 was synthesised using the classic nucleophilic aliphatic substitution on a good leaving group, tosylate, with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoride using tetraethylammonium bicarbonate in acetonitrile at 100<sup></sup>C. The process was fully automated on a Trasis AllinOne synthesiser using an in-house designed cassette and sequence. With a relatively small precursor load of 4 mg, [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 was obtained with consistently high radiochemical yields of 55-71% (n=6) and molar activities of 117-350 GBq/micromol at end of synthesis. With a single production batch, starting with 31-42 GBq of [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoride, between 13-20 GBq of the tracer can be produced, enabling multi-centre studies. Conclusion(s): To the best of our knowledge, the process presented herein is the most efficient [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 synthesis, with advantageous GMP compliance. The use of a Trasis AllinOne synthesiser increases reliability and allows rapid training of production staff. Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
2139,"Visually induced initiation of Drosophila innate courtship-like following pursuit is mediated by central excitatory state The courtship ritual of male Drosophila represents an innate behaviour that is initiated by female-derived sensory stimuli. Here we report that moving light spots can induce courtship-like following pursuit in tethered wild-type male flies provided the fly is primed by optogenetic stimulation of specific dsx-expressing neuronal clusters in the lateral protocerebrum (LPR). Namely, stimulation of the pC1 neuronal cluster initiates unilateral wing extension and vibration of both sides, whereas stimulation of the pC2l cluster initiates only contralateral wing displays. In addition, stimulation of pC2l but not pC1 neurons induced abdominal bending and proboscis extension. Ca(2+) imaging of the pC1 cluster revealed periodic Ca(2+) rises, each corresponding to a turn of the male fly during courtship. In contrast, group-reared fru mutant males exhibit light spot-induced courtship pursuit without optogenetic priming. Ca(2+) imaging revealed enhanced responses of LPR neurons to visual stimuli in the mutants, suggesting a neural correlate of the light spot-induced courtship behaviour.",Excluded
984,"Increased risk of ischemic stroke after radiotherapy on the neck in patients younger than 60 years PURPOSE: To estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in patients irradiated for head and neck tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of ischemic stroke was determined in 367 patients with head and neck tumors (162 larynx carcinomas, 114 pleomorphic adenomas, and 91 parotid carcinomas) who had been treated with local radiotherapy (RT) at an age younger than 60 years. Relative risk (RR) of ischemic stroke was determined by comparison with population rates from a stroke-incidence register, adjusted for sex and age. Other risk factors for stroke (hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus [DM]) were registered. The median follow-up time after RT was 7.7 years (3,011 person-years of follow-up).RESULTS: Fourteen cases of stroke occurred (expected, 2.5; RR, 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1 to 9.4): eight in patients with laryngeal carcinoma (expected,1.56; RR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 10.1), four in pleomorphic adenoma patients (expected, 0.71; RR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 14.5), and two in parotid carcinoma patients (expected, 0.24; RR, 8.5, 95% CI, 1.0 to 30.6). Five of six strokes in patients irradiated for a parotid tumor occurred at the ipsilateral side. Analysis of other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease showed hypertension and DM to cause an increase of the RR after RT. After more than 10 years' follow-up, the RR was 10.1 (95% CI, 4.4 to 20.0). The 15-year cumulative risk of stroke after RT on the neck was 12.0% (95% CI, 6.5% to 21.4%).CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate an increased risk of stroke after RT on the neck. During medical follow-up, preventive measures should be taken to reduce the impact of the risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, to decrease stroke in these patients.",Included
1275,"Comparative study of anatomical connectivity of prelemniscal radiations in healthy subjects and Parkinso's disease patients Objective: Characterize the anatomic connectivity of prelemniscal radiations (Raprl) and identify differences in the fiber populations that conform the Raprl using probabilistic tractography. Background(s): The Raprl have been proposed as a neurosurgical target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of PD since 1970's. Despite its clinical usefulness the anatomic connectivity of the Raprl remains unknown. Method(s): Images from 12 healthy subjects and 6 PD patients were acquired using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner. Diffusionweighted images were acquired using 120 unique diffusion-gradient directions with beta=2000s/mm2 (voxel size of 2x2x2mm3). Constrained spherical deconvolution was performed, followed by the creation of track-density images using MRtrix (Brain Research Institute Australia), resulting in final resolution of 0.2x0.2x0.2mm3; these images were crucial for the accurate manual segmentation of subthalamic structures. We seeded 50000 streamlines at the level of the Raprl, differences of streamlines interconnecting the Raprl between groups were assessed by Student's t-test. Result(s): All subjects showed Raprl connectivity with cortical and subcortical structures, when these fiber bundles enter the posterior limb of internal capsule they show a clear spatial organization according to their targets, from anterior to posterior as follows: 1) orbitofrontal cortex, 2) globus pallidus (GP) 3) supplementary motor area and 4) primary motor cortex and cerebellum. In 87.5% of healthy subjects GP showed connectivity with the contralateral dorsal brainstem in a region that corresponds to the location of the contralateral pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), the same connectivity pattern is present in 83.3% of PD patients. The number of reconstructed streamlines obtained showed differences between groups in the connectivity to pallidum (left p=0.017, right p=0.045) and in thalamus (left p=0.02, right p=0.006). Conclusion(s): PD patients that have undergone Raprl-DBS show an improvement on gait that also occurs after unilateral GP-DBS, which could be explained because of the bilateral connections from Raprl to PPN through fibers crossing the midline at lower midbrain. Our findings provide new insights into subthalamic connectivity that allow explaining clinical benefits obtained after Raprl-DBS.",Excluded

However, upon cessation of treatment, tumor growth resumes. We hypothesized that incorporation of radioactive polyamines might kill the growth-arrested cells. This hypothesis was previously tested in rat 9L brain tumor cells in which DFMO increased both the uptake and the retention of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine. In these rat cells, DFMO-induced retention of high-specific-activity [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine for 20 days resulted in several logs killing. In the present studies all of the 5 different human glioma cell lines tested with DFMO treatment also showed enhanced uptake of exogenous [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine, reduced cell counts and enhanced killing of colony forming cells (CSF). Extending the time of DFMO treatment of cells that had taken up high-specific-activity (80 Ci/mmol) [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine further increased the killing. A 10-day extension resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in cumulative cell growth. A 5-day extension resulted in a 2-3 log decrease in numbers of surviving CFC. These data further support the hypothesis and suggest that DFMO-induced cell cycle arrest enhances cellular retention of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine, increasing the effective internal radiation dose enough to cause proliferative death. In a clinical setting, the short (~ 1 mum) path-length of the tritium beta particle should limit effects to the tumor cells and spare adjacent normal cells. These results support the concept that treatment with the combination of polyamine inhibitors and radioactive polyamines might be a useful adjunct to current therapies for glioblastoma multiforme.",Excluded

Radiation effects may be acute, occurring during the course of treatment, or subacute or chronic, arising months or years after treatment has been completed. One of the basic problems the clinician and radiologist face is to differentiate radiation effect from recurrence of cancer. The anatomic areas covered in this paper include the kidneys, ureters, bladder, male and female genital tracts, and the embryo and fetus.

3198,"ATP consumption by mammalian rod photoreceptors in darkness and in light Why do vertebrates use rods and cones that hyperpolarize, when in insect eyes a single depolarizing photoreceptor can function at all light levels? We answer this question at least in part with a comprehensive assessment of ATP consumption for mammalian rods from voltages and currents and recently published physiological and biochemical data. In darkness, rods consume 10(8) ATP s(-1), about the same as Drosophila photoreceptors. Ion fluxes associated with phototransduction and synaptic transmission dominate; as in CNS, the contribution of enzymes of the second-messenger cascade is surprisingly small. Suppression of rod responses in daylight closes light-gated channels and reduces total energy consumption by >75%, but in Drosophila light opens channels and increases consumption 5-fold. Rods therefore provide an energy-efficient mechanism not present in rhabdomeric photoreceptors. Rods are metabolically less ""costly"" than cones, because cones do not saturate in bright light and use more ATP s(-1) for transducin activation and rhodopsin phosphorylation. This helps to explain why the vertebrate retina is duplex, and why some diurnal animals like primates have a small number of cones, concentrated in a region of high acuity.",Excluded

288,"Ataxia telangiectasia mutant protein activates c-Abl tyrosine kinase in response to ionizing radiation Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder with pleiotropic phenotypes, including neuronal degeneration, immune dysfunction, premature ageing and increased cancer risk. The gene mutated in AT, ATM, encodes a putative lipid or protein kinase. Most of the human AT patient phenotypes are recapitulated in Atm-deficient mice. Cells derived from Atm-/- mice, like those from AT patients, exhibit abnormal response to ionizing radiation. One of the known responses to ionizing radiation is the activation of a nuclear tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-abl proto-oncogene. Ionizing radiation does not activate c-Abl in cells from AT patients or in thymocytes or fibroblasts from the Atm-deficient mice. Ectopic expression of a functional ATM kinase domain corrects this defect, as it phosphorylates the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in vitro at Ser 465, leading to the activation of c-Abl. A mutant c-Abl with Ser 465 changed to Ala 465 is not activated by ionizing radiation or ATM kinase in vivo. These findings identify the c-Abl tyrosine kinase as a downstream target of phosphorylation and activation by the ATM kinase in the cellular response to ionizing radiation.",Excluded

576,"Coordinated action of the Fanconi anemia and ataxia telangiectasia pathways in response to oxidative damage Fanconi anemia (FA) and ataxia telangiectasia (AT) share common traits such chromosomal instability and proneness to hematological cancers. Both AT and FA cell lines, and patients, are characterized by abnormally high levels of oxidative stress markers. The key FA protein FANCD2 is phosphorylated on Ser 222 by ATM after ionizing radiation (IR), thus allowing normal activation of the S-phase checkpoint, and ATM cells are known to be hypersensitive to oxidative damage. In this work we show that FANCD2 deficient cells have a defective S-phase checkpoint after Hydrogen Peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induced oxidative damage. ATM dependent phosphorylation of FANCD2 at the S222 residue is necessary for normal S-phase checkpoint activation after oxidative stress, while FANCD2 monoubiquitination at K561 is dispensable. We also show that FANCD2 is not required for base excision repair of 8-oxoG and other DNA lesions (abasic sites, uracils), while treatments that exclusively induce 8-oxoG, but not DNA double strand breaks, fail to activate FANCD2 monoubiquitination, thus indicating that the known accumulation of 8-oxoG in FA cells reflects an overproduction of ROS rather than defective processing of oxidized bases. We conclude that the handling of DNA damage after H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress requires the coordinated action of FANCD2 and ATM.",Excluded

Effective treatment for this irreversible event has not been established. The lying mechanism of RN is to be elucidated in order to establish a new therapy. We have established brain RN mouse model using proton beam at the Wakasa Wan Energy research Center. In this model, RN was induced 8 months after irradiation and the histology of the necrosis recapitulated the human RN patients [Kondo N.2015]. So far, some researchers investigated the mechanism of RN based on protein level. However, with the advanced mass spectrometry technology, lipid mediator response to ionizing radiation was reported [Laiakis EC, 2014]. Therefore, in this study, lipid alteration after proton beam irradiation was investigated in mouse brain RN model using high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizing imaging mass spectrometry (HR-MALDI-IMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Generation of mouse brain RN model: C57BL/6J mice were irradiated in the restricted area of right brain at 60 Gy using proton beam. Tissue preparation: After 4 months later mouse was sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with cold PBS. The brain was extracted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in-80degreeC. The brain was sliced to a thickness of 4 mum with a cryostat and placed onto an indium tin oxide coated glass slide and stored at-20 degreeC until matrix application and subsequent HR-MALDI-IMS analysis. Each slide was anchored in vacuum deposition equipment and coated with 9-aminoacridine hemihydrates (9-AA) matrix layer obtained by sublimation at 220degreeC. The sequential sections were mounted onto glass slides for hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) staining. HR-MALDI-IMS analysis: HR-MALDI-IMS analysis was performed on a high-resolution microscopic imaging mass spectrometer (iMScope; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectrometry data were acquired in negative and positive mode in the mass range of m/z 700-1000. Statistical Analysis: Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed by Imaging MS Solution (ver 1, 12, 26; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).

2196,"Detection of abasic sites and oxidative DNA base damage using an ELISA-like assay Reactive oxygen species produce a wide spectrum of DNA damage, including oxidative base damage and abasic (AP) sites. Many procedures are available for the quantification and detection of base damage and AP sites. However, either these procedures are laborious or the starting materials are difficult to obtain. A biotinylated aldehyde-specific reagent, ARP, has been shown to react specifically with the aldehyde group present in AP sites, resulting in biotin-tagged AP sites in DNA. The biotin-tagged AP sites can then be determined colorimetrically with an ELISA-like assay, using avidin/biotin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase as the indicator enzyme. The ARP assay is thus a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the detection of AP sites in DNA. Furthermore, removal of damaged base by DNA N-glycosylases generates AP sites that can be measured by the ARP reagent. By coupling the ARP assay with either endonuclease III from Escherichia coli or 8-oxoguanine N-glycosylase (OGG1) from yeast, investigators can rapidly determine the amount of oxidative pyrimidine damage (endonuclease III-sensitive sites) or purine damage (OGG1-sensitive sites) in cellular DNA, respectively. An increased levei of oxidative damage has been implicated in several age-related human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease, as well as the aging process. The sensitivity and simplicity of the ARP assay thus make it a valuable method for investigators who are interested in estimating the level of oxidative DNA damage in cells and tissues derived from patients with various age-related diseases or cancers.

No signs of acute adverse effects of radiation treatment were recorded. Late radiation effects versus tumor progression could not be confirmed histopathologically because of few animals undergoing necropsy.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study provides preliminary evidence that dogs with PNST benefit from SRT in terms of long-term survival.

The average reduction of the mean dose to the 10-mm ring surrounding the target between the uncollimated and collimated plans was calculated for the UN and the DN. Target conformity was analyzed using the mean dose to 1-mm thickness rings surrounding the target at increasing distances ranging from 1 to 10 mm. Result(s): The average reductions of the 10-mm ring mean dose for the UN and DN plans were 13.7% (95% CI: 11.6%-15.7%; p < 0.0001) and 11.5% (95% CI: 9.5%-13.5%; p < 0.0001) across all brain cases and 7.1% (95% CI: 4.4%-9.8%; p < 0.001) and 6.3% (95% CI: 3.7%-9.0%; p < 0.001), respectively, across all head and neck cases. The collimated UN plans were either more conformal (all brain cases and 60% of the head and neck cases) than or equivalent (40% of the head and neck cases) to the uncollimated DN plans. The collimated DN plans offered the highest conformity. Conclusion(s): The DCS added either to the UN or DN improved the target conformity. The DCS may be of particular interest for sites with UN systems looking for a more economical solution than upgrading the nozzle to improve the target conformity of their spot scanning proton therapy system.

834,"Long-term depression is not modulated by ATP receptors in the rat CA1 hippocampal region ATP is an important extracellular messenger in the CNS. In the hippocampus, a brain structure relevant for learning and memory processes, it acts both as a modulator and as a mediator of synaptic transmission, with implications for synaptic plasticity phenomena. Recent evidence suggests that ATP modulates activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. However, it remains unclear if ATP also modulates LTP counterpart's phenomenon, long-term depression (LTD), in the rat hippocampus. This study investigated the effect of ATP analogues on homosynaptic LTD, induced by low-frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals (1 Hz; 900 pulses) in the CA1 region of young rat hippocampal slices. The metabolically stable ATP analogues beta,gamma-ImATP (20 microM), a P2 receptor agonist, and alpha,beta-MeATP (20 microM), a preferential P2X(1,3) receptor agonist, did not modify LTD (LTD values of 14.7+/-0.5% and 14.1+/-3% for aCSF controls and of 15.1+/-4% and 19.0+/-5.2% for beta,gamma-ImATP and alpha,beta-MeATP, respectively). The ATP analogue beta,gamma-ImATP (20 microM) did not modify LTD also in the presence of the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (50 nM) (21.5+/-4.2% for DPCPX only and of 23.8+/-8.9% for DPCPX plus beta,gamma-ImATP). Finally, the preferential P2X(1,3) receptor antagonist NF023 (10 microM) had also no effect on LTD (18.6+/-5.2% for aCSF and of 18.7+/-5.2% for NF023). The present results suggest that ATP does not modulate activity-dependent homosynaptic LTD in the rat CA1 hippocampal region by activating P2 receptors.",Excluded

2775,"A rat in vitro model for the measurement of multiple excitability properties of cutaneous axons OBJECTIVE: To establish an in vitro model for measurement of the excitability properties of cutaneous sensory axons.METHODS: We used a saphenous skin-nerve preparation from adult rat in combination with computerized threshold tracking. We measured strength-duration time constant, the recovery of excitability after a supramaximal stimulus and the accommodation to conditioning subthreshold polarizing stimuli (threshold electrotonus, current-threshold relationship) and compared these with previously published recordings from sensory axons in human median nerve.RESULTS: Threshold electrotonus and the amplitude of superexcitability were indistinguishable between human median nerve in vivo and rat saphenous nerve in vitro, but several excitability parameters were significantly different in the rat: strength-duration time constant was significantly shorter (0.19+/-0.01 vs. 0.53+/-0.02 ms); the refractory period was shorter (1.9+/-1.1 ms vs. 3.5+/-1.0 ms) and late subexcitability was smaller (6.3+/-0.3% vs. 11.3+/-0.5%); thirdly, during recording of current-threshold relationship, rat nerves displayed more inward rectification to strong hyperpolarizing currents. Parameters were stable over more than 3h.CONCLUSIONS: Excitability changes of sensory Abeta-fibres can be reliably studied in the rat in vitro and are qualitatively similar to humans.SIGNIFICANCE: This rat model will facilitate pharmacological studies of nerve excitability and work on models of neuropathy.",Excluded

These free radicals cause oxidative stress in distant organs. Oxidative status may be reversed by naturally occurring antioxidant agents. The aim of this study was to investigate protective and antioxidant effects of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) and thymoquinone (TQ) in kidney tissue of rats exposed to cranial irradiation. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: IR group received irradiation (IR) to total cranium plus saline; IR plus NSO group received IR and NSO; IR plus TQ group received IR and TQ; sham group did not receive NSO, TQ or IR; control group of TQ received dimethyl sulfoxide; control group of NSO received saline. Total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) levels were studied as oxidative parameters, and total antioxidant status (TAS), total sulfhydryl levels, paraoxonase (PON), ceruloplasmin (Cp) and arylesterase activities were determined as antioxidative parameters in the kidney tissue of rats. Kidney TOS, OSI and LOOH levels were significantly lower in IR plus TQ, IR plus NSO and sham groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001). TAS, PON and Cp activities in IR group were significantly lower compared to the control group (p < 0.001). PON and Cp activities were significantly higher in IR plus NSO and IR plus TQ groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001). In conclusion, free radicals generated by cranial ionizing radiation exposure cause oxidative stress in kidney.

3063,"A strategy for the use of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) on linear accelerators and its impact on treatment margins for prostate cancer patients Background and Purpose: In external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer, the consideration of various systematic error types leads to wide treatment margins compromising normal tissue tolerance. We investigated if systematic set-up errors can be reduced by a set of initial image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) sessions. Patients and Methods: 27 patients received daily IGRT resulting in a set of 882 cone-beam computed tomographies (CBCTs). After matching to bony structures, we analyzed the dimensions of remaining systematic errors from zero up to six initial IGRT sessions and aimed at a restriction of daily IGRT for 10% of all patients. For threshold definition, we determined the standard deviations (SD) of the shift corrections and selected patients out of this range for daily image guidance. To calculate total treatment margins, we demanded for a cumulative clinical target volume (CTV) coverage of at least 95% of the specified dose in 90% of all patients. Result(s): The gain of accuracy was largest during the first three IGRTs. In order to match precision and workload criteria, thresholds for the SD of the corrections of 3.5 mm, 2.0 mm and 4.5 mm in the left-right (L-R), cranial-caudal (C-C), and anterior-posterior (A-P) direction, respectively, were identified. Including all other error types, the total margins added to the CTV amounted to 8.6 mm in L-R, 10.4 mm in C-C, and 14.4 mm in A-P direction. Conclusion(s): Only initially performed IGRT might be helpful for eliminating gross systematic errors especially after virtual simulation. However, even with daily IGRT performance, a substantial PTV margin reduction is only achievable by matching internal markers instead of bony anatomical structures. Â© 2008 Urban & Vogel.",Excluded

Purpose(s): To assess the effect of gadodiamide and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) on T<inf>1</inf>-weighted images and on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of DN. Study Type: Single-center retrospective. Population: In all, 125 patients who underwent brain MRIs were classified into four groups: 1) patients who did neither receive intravenous GBCAs injections nor irradiation (controls); 2) patients having >=3 GBCAs-enhanced scans and no WBRT; 3) patients having WBRT and < 3 GBCAs-enhanced scans; and 4) patients having WBRT and >= 3 GBCAs-enhanced scans. Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5T magnet, echo-planar diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and unenhanced T<inf>1</inf>-weighted sequences. Assessment: The DN-to-pons SI ratio on unenhanced T<inf>1</inf>-weighted images and ADC values of the DN were calculated.

1218,"Isotopic cisternography in detection of CSF rhinorrhea. [German] The radioisotope cisternogram has proven itself to be a valuable diagnostic procedure during the evaluation of patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. If it is not possible to define the origin of such a leak, extensive intracranial explorations may be required, which may or may not result in successful correction of the defect. As a functional examination with limited risk to the patient and minimal radiation exposure, the isotopic cisternogram can either establish a diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea or eliminate cerebrospinal fluid as a cause for rhinorrhea. When occurring, CSF leaks can be shown by demonstrating a 'path' from the cranial fossage into the nasal cavity. The present technique utilizes tampons placed in each nostril. A positive diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea is made by finding a tampon impregnated with at least twice the radioactivity of a control tampon from the opposite nostril (in the presence of an intact septum). Conclusions indicate that a positive anterior fossa cisternogram may be the only evidence for hidden site of CSF leakage, especially when other signs are lacking.",Excluded

Previous data in a smaller sample set suggested that YKL-40 was a marker associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a genetically defined subgroup of glioblastoma. Here we test these findings in a larger series of patients with glioblastoma, and in particular, determine if tumor YKL-40 expression is associated with radiation response.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=147) with subtotal resections were studied for imaging-assessed changes in tumor size in serial studies following radiation therapy. An additional set (n=140) of glioblastoma patients who underwent a gross-total resection was tested to validate the survival association and extend them to patients with minimal residual disease.RESULTS: In the subtotal resection group, higher YKL-40 expression was significantly associated with poorer radiation response, shorter time to progression and shorter overall survival. The association of higher YKL-40 expression with poorer survival was validated in the gross-total resection group. In multivariate analysis with both groups combined (n = 287), YKL-40 was an independent predictor of survival after adjusting for patient age, performance status, and extent of resection. YKL-40 expression was also compared with genetically defined subsets of glioblastoma by assessing epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and loss at chromosome 10q, two of the common recurring aberrations in these tumors, using fluorescent in situ hybridization. YKL-40 was significantly associated with 10q loss.CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate YKL-40 as an important marker of therapeutic response and genetic subtype in glioblastomas and suggest that it may play an oncogenic role in these tumors.",Included
684,"Low dose fractionated radiotherapy and temozolomiDe in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: Preliminary results of a pilot study Purpose: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the brain tumor with the worst prognosis, especially for patients with gross residual tumor after surgery (RPA classes V and VI). In vitro studies demonstrated the hyper-radiosensitivity of human malignant glioma cell lines to low radiation doses, moreover preclinical studies hypothesized a synergism between low doses fractionated radiotherapy (LD-FRT) and chemotherapy. Therefore we planned a pilot study to define the feasibility and the efficacy of this approach in na GBM RPA classes V-VI. Materials: Patients enrolled in the study had the following characteristics: histological diagnosis of GBM, based on minimal surgical resection or biopsy; age 18-80 years; RPA classes V-VI; estimated survival 3 months; normal haematological, renal, hepatic, cardiac and respiratory functions. Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was defined as the surgical bed with gross residual contrast-enhancing tissue on magnetic resonance imaging. The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) was defined as the GTV with a 30 mm margin to incluDe any potential subclinical tumor. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) was defined as CTV + 5 mm, due to set-up uncertainties. Hypofractionated 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) was delivered on GTV (total dose: 30 Gy in fractions of 3 Gy/day) with concomitant and adjuvant (1 cycle) temozolomiDe (TMZ). From second to fifth cycle of adjuvant TMZ (200 mg/m2), if neither progression disease was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, nor unacceptable toxicities were recorded, LD-FRT was associated (2 daily fractions of 0.40 Gy, over 5 days, q 28). Primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of toxicity and safety of this schedula (RTOG criteria). Clinical response (RECIST criteria), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also evaluated. Result(s): From June 2008 to October 2010 15 patients with a newly diagnosis of GBM were enrolled in this study. Eight patients underwent incomplete surgical resection and 7 patients received only biopsy. The median total dose of LD-FRT delivered was 1040 cGy (range 320 1920). Up to this date 11 patients are evaluable. GraDe 12 haematological toxicity was observed in 18 % of patients, graDe 34 was observed in 9 % of patients, mainly represented by leukopenia and thrombocytopenia; however no neurological acute and late toxicity were observed. No treatment related death occurred. Four patients (36%) had a partial response (PR), while 2 patients (18%) had a stable disease (SD), lasting more than 8 weeks (Clinical Benefit 54%). At a median follow-up of 9 months (range 2 22) median PFS was 5 months and median OS was 9 months, with a survival rate at 1 year of 30%. Conclusion(s): The results of the study demonstrated that LD-FRT with concurrent chemotherapy, after hypofractionated 3D-CRT plus Temozolomide, is a well tolerated treatment with a low toxicity profile. This data seem to be encouraging and suggest the prosecution of the analysis.",Excluded

1065,"Percutaneous fixation of thoracolumbar fractures. Does index level fixation help in fracture reduction and stability? Introduction: Thoracolumbar burst fractures are caused by compression injury with subsequent loss of vertebral height and development of local kyphotic deformity. The application of pedicle screws in the fractured vertebrae i.e. index level fixation, had been proven to help in reduction and correction of the local kyphotic deformity and anterior vertebral height loss with their maintenance in short segment fixation. Recently, percutaneous pedicle screws are introduced and used in the thoracolumbar fracture fixation with the proposed advantage of the less soft tissue dissection, muscle disruption and atrophy and assumed less wound related complications. Controversy remains about the ability of the percutaneous instrumentation to reduce and maintain the correction of local kyphosis and lost vertebral height caused by the fracture compared to the open instrumentation. Material(s) and Method(s): In this prospective study, thirty-eight neurologically intact patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures (T11-L2) type A3 and A4 according to AOSpine classification were treated between 2012 and 2015 with posterior pedicle screw fixation. The patients were divided into two groups, group 1 included 18 patients treated with percutaneous pedicle screws (PPS) while group 2 included 20 patients treated by standard open posterior approach with pedicle screws fixation (OPS). The operative data (blood loss, radiation exposure, operative time, and cost of implants) were compared between the two groups. The patients' radiographs were assessed for local kyphotic angle (LKA) and anterior vertebral body height (AVH) compression and compared for correction and maintenance. The patients' visual analogue scale (VAS) for back pain and treatment related complications were reported. Result(s): The blood loss was the only operative parameter that was significantly less in the PPS group and although the operative time decreased in the PPS group by the increase in learning curve, the other operative data show significant difference in favor of the OPS group. Post-operative correction of the local vertebral compression assessed radiologically with LKA and AVH significantly improved in both groups compared to the pre-operative degree and was maintained till the end of follow up. No major wound related complication was found in both groups. VAS of back pain was significantly reduced in PPS group in the early postoperative follow up than the OPS, but both groups at the end showed a significant improvement between early post-operative and late follow up. Conclusion(s): Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation is a good minimally invasive modality in the management of thoracolumbar fractures and the application of screw in the fractured vertebrae improves the correction and maintenance of local kyphosis in short segment fixation. Cost effectiveness of this technique must be evaluated thoroughly with the final and late outcome of this management. More randomized controlled and multicenter studies are needed to support these findings.",Excluded

708,"TopBP1 and Claspin contribute to the radioresistance of lung cancer brain metastases BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is one of the most effective therapeutic tools for brain metastasis. However, it is inevitable that some cancer cells become resistant to radiation. This study is focused on the identification of genes associated with radioresistance in metastatic brain tumor from lung cancer and the functional examination of the selected genes with regards to altered sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation.METHODS: After establishing radioresistant cells from the xenograft model, we explored the significant transcriptional changes by performing DNA microarray profiling. Functional analyses in vitro and in vivo performed to validate the gene responsible for radioresistance.RESULTS: Transcriptional changes induced by radiation therapy are much more extensive in H460 cells than in PC14PE6 cells. The expression levels of TopBP1 and Claspin were increased in the cancer cells that survived radiation therapy. Depletion of TopBP1 or Claspin using shRNA showed an enhancement of sensitivity to radiation in radioresistant lung cancer cells (PC14PE6). Moreover, increased levels of TopBP1 or Claspin endowed cells a higher resistance to radiation. In xenograft models, the knock-down of TopBP1 or Claspin significantly prolonged the median survival time post radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed the gene expression profiles of the radiosensitive cells and the radioresistant cells to define a set of genes that may be involved in endowing lung cancer cells radioresistance post brain metastasis. Functional analyses indicated that the expression TopBP1 and Claspin positively affects the survival of cancer cells and thus negatively the xenograft metastasis model animals in response to radiation.

735,"Hypo-fractionated IMRT for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: a 6 year single institutional experience OBJECTIVES: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults. Surgery and radiotherapy constitute the cornerstones for the therapeutic management of GBM. The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol. Despite the progress in neurosurgery, radiotherapy and oncology, the prognosis still results poor. In order to reduce the long time of standard treatment, maintaining or improving the clinical results, in our institute we have investigated the effects of hypo-fractionated radiation therapy for patients with GBM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients affected by GBM who had previously undergone surgical resection (total, subtotal or biopsy) were enrolled between October 2005 and December 2011 in a single institutional study of hypo-fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) followed or not by adjuvant chemotherapy with TMZ (6-12 cycles). The most important eligibility criteria were: biopsy-proven GBM, KPS >= 60, age >= 18 years, no previous brain irradiation, informed consensus. Hypo-fractionated IMRT was delivered to a total dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions prescribed to 70% isodose. Response to treatment, OS, PFS, toxicity and patterns of recurrence were evaluated, and sex, age, type of surgery, Karnofsky performance status, Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification, time between surgery and initiation of radiotherapy were evaluated as potential prognostic factors for survival.RESULTS: All patients have completed the treatment protocol. Median age was 64.5 years (range 41-82 years) with 31 females (46%) and 36 males (54%). Median KPS at time of treatment was 80. The surgery was gross total in 38 patients and subtotal in 14 patients; 15 patients underwent only biopsy. No grade 3-4 acute or late neurotoxicity was observed. With median follow-up of 14.9 months, the median OS and PFS were 13.4 and 7.9 months, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The hypo-fractionated radiation therapy can be used for patients with GBM, resulting in favourable overall survival, low rates of toxicity and satisfying QoL. Future investigations are needed to determine the optimal fractionation for GBM.",Excluded
2613,"LET dependence on killing effect and mutagenicity in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa PURPOSE: To assess the unique biological effects of different forms of ionizing radiation causing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), we compared the killing effect, mutagenesis frequency, and mutation type spectrum using the model filamentous fungus Neurospora.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Asexual spores of wild-type Neurospora and two DSB repair-deficient strains [one homologous recombination- and the other non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway-deficient] were irradiated with argon (Ar)-ion beams, ferrous (Fe)-ion beams, or X-rays. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), forward mutation frequencies at the ad-3 loci, and mutation spectra at the ad-3B gene were determined.RESULTS: The canonical NHEJ (cNHEJ)-deficient strain showed resistance to higher X-ray doses, while other strains showed dose-dependent sensitivity. In contrast, the killing effects of Ar-ion and Fe-ion beam irradiation were dose-dependent in all strains tested. The rank order of RBE was Ar-ion > Fe-ion > C-ion. Deletion mutations were the most common, but deletion size incremented with the increasing value of linear energy transfer (LET).CONCLUSIONS: We found marked differences in killing effect of a cNHEJ-deficient mutant between X-ray and high-LET ion beam irradiations (Ar and Fe). The mutation spectra also differed between irradiation types. These differences may be due to the physical properties of each radiation and the repair mechanism of induced damage in Neurospora crassa.

Here, we applied the theta burst stimulation (TBS) protocol, a novel form of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) over the lateral cerebellum. The aim of this study was to test whether TBS of the lateral cerebellum could be able to modulate the excitability of the contralateral M1 in healthy subjects.METHODS: Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) amplitude, short intracortical inhibition (SICI), long intracortical inhibition (LICI) and short intracortical facilitation (SICF) were tested in the M1 before and after cerebellar continuous TBS (cTBS) or intermittent TBS (iTBS).RESULTS: We found that cTBS induced a reduction of SICI and an increase of LICI. On the other hand, cerebellar iTBS reduced LICI. MEPs amplitude also differently vary following cerebellar stimulation with cTBS or iTBS, resulting in a decrease by the former and an increase by the latter.CONCLUSIONS: Although the interpretation of these data remains highly speculative, these findings reveal that the cerebellar cortex undergoes bidirectional plastic changes that modulate different intracortical circuits within the contralateral primary motor cortex.SIGNIFICANCE: Long-lasting modifications of these pathways could be useful to treat various pathological conditions characterized by an altered cortical excitability.",Excluded
3018,"Tracking target position variability using intraprostatic fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging in prostate cancer radiotherapy Modern radiotherapy has achieved substantial improvement in tumour control and toxicity rates by escalating the total dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding normal tissues. It has therefore become necessary to precisely track tumour position in order to minimise geometrical uncertainties due to setup errors and organ motion. We conducted this prospective evaluation of prostate cancer patients treated with image-guided conformal radiation therapy at our institution. We implanted three fiducial markers (gold seeds) within the prostatic gland in order to quantify daily target displacements and to generate specific margins around the clinical target volume (CTV) to create an appropriate planned target volume (PTV). Between April and December 2009, ten patients affected with localised prostate cancer were transrectally implanted with three radio-opaque markers. Each patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan for planning purposes following proper bladder and rectum preparation. During treatment two orthogonal images were acquired daily and compared with previously generated digitally reconstructed radiographs. After manual localisation, comparison between the position of the gold seeds on the portal and reference images was carried out, and a set of extrapolated lateral-lateral (LL), anterior-posterior (AP) and cranial-caudal (CC) shift corrections was calculated and recorded. Couch corrections were applied with a threshold of 3 mm displacement. Systematic and random errors for each direction were calculated either as measured according to displacement of the gold seeds prior to any couch movement and after couch position correction according to the radio-opaque markers. For skin marks, mean systematic and random errors were 0.12+2.94 mm for LL, 1.04+3.37 mm for AP, -1.14+2.71 mm for CC, whereas for seed markers, mean and systematic errors were 0.6+1.5 mm for LL, 0.51+2.45 mm for AP and -0.25+2.51 mm for CC. A scatter plot generated on all measurements after couch repositioning according to gold-seed displacement suggested a confidence range of shift distributions within 5 mm for LL, 8 mm for CC, and 7 mm for AP. The total systematic and random components were then used to calculate proper PTV in patients receiving conventional treatment (7 mm for LL and 9 mm for both AP and CC). Prostate positional variability during a course of radiation treatment is strongly influenced by setup and organ motion. Organ tracking through fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging is able to reduce the spread of displacements, significantly contributing to improve the ballistic precision of radiation delivery.",Excluded

69,"Electroretinographic Assessment of Inner Retinal Signaling in the Isolated and Superfused Murine Retina PURPOSE: Longer-lasting electroretinographic recordings of the isolated murine retina were initially achieved by modification of a phosphate-buffered nutrient solution originally developed for the bovine retina. During experiments with a more sensitive mouse retina, apparent model-specific limitations were addressed and improvements were analyzed for their contribution to an optimized full electroretinogram (ERG).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retinas were isolated from dark-adapted mice, transferred to a recording chamber and superfused with different solutions. Scotopic and photopic ERGs were recorded with white flashes every 3 minutes. The phosphate buffer (Sickel-medium) originally used was replaced by a carbonate-based system (Ames-medium), the pH of which was adjusted to 7.7-7.8. Moreover, addition of 0.1 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub> was investigated to reduce b-wave contamination by the slow PIII component typically present in the murine ERG.RESULTS: B-wave amplitudes were increased by the pH-shift (pH 7.4 to pH 7.7) from 22.9 +/- 1.9 microV to 37.5 +/- 2.5 microV. Improved b-wave responses were also achieved by adding small amounts of Ba<sup>2+</sup> (100 microM), which selectively suppressed slow PIII components, thereby unmasking more of the true b-wave amplitude (100.0% with vs. 22.2 +/- 10.7% without Ba<sup>2+</sup>). Ames medium lacking amino acids and vitamins was unable to maintain retinal signaling, as evident in a reversible decrease of the b-wave to 31.8 +/- 3.9% of its amplitude in complete Ames medium.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide optimized conditions for ex vivo ERGs from the murine retina and suggest that careful application of Ba<sup>2+</sup> supports reliable isolation of b-wave responses in mice. Under our recording conditions, murine retinas show reproducible ERGs for up to six hours.",Excluded

2724,"Retrospective outcomes of right colon continent urinary diversion in a single center, improving the characterization of complication and reoperation risk INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Published studies of right colon pouch urinary diversion have variable outcomes with an estimated 1-50% risk of perioperative Clavien-Dindo 3+ complications and 1-69% risk of long term reoperation. This range is partly due to variability in outcome measurement and inclusion of differing patient characteristics and operative indications; it is unclear which factors are predisposing factors for complications and risk of reoperation in these studies leaving preoperative counseling difficult. We seek to characterize the impact that patient specific factors and operative indications have on risk of complications and reoperation for patients undergoing a right colon pouch as well as present the cumulative risk of reoperation over time. METHOD(S): Patients undergoing right colon pouch from January 2010 to April 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Outcomes of interest were rate of Clavien-Dindo complications in the perioperative period, readmission rate, and rate of reoperation. Patient specific factors association with Clavien Grade 3+ complications and reoperation were also analyzed. Operative indication for patients was stratified into: Cancer, Radiation Injury, Neurogenic, and Non-Neurogenic. A Kaplan Meier plot was used to characterize reoperation risk over time with death as a competing factor. RESULT(S): During the study period 60 patients underwent the procedure with an average follow up of 22 months. The rate of Clavien Grade 3+ complications and readmission rate in the 90 day post operative period was 25% and 43% respectively. The cumulative rate of reoperation was 52%. Overall no patient factors or operative indications were significantly associated with complications or reoperation. CONCLUSION(S): Overall the rate of complications, readmissions, and reoperation was high, but in agreement with other contemporary series. Right colon pouch is a difficult procedure on which to counsel patients due to the paucity of available data. The surgical outcomes and results at our center help further characterize the risks associated with this procedure, and the Kaplan Meier plot of reoperation risk can be used to illustrate that this procedure comes with significant risks over time.",Excluded

2601,"Furosemide potentiates the anticonvulsant action of valproate in the mouse maximal electroshock seizure model Accumulating evidence indicates that furosemide (FUR, a loop diuretic) exerts the anticonvulsant action in various in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of FUR on the protective action of numerous conventional and newer antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine [CBZ], lamotrigine [LTG], oxcarbazepine [OXC], phenobarbital [PB], topiramate [TPM] and valproate [VPA]) in the mouse maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model. Results indicate that FUR (up to 100mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the test) neither altered the threshold for electroconvulsions nor protected the animals against MES-induced seizures in mice. FUR (100 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the anticonvulsant effects of VPA in the MES test by reducing its ED(50) value from 230.4 to 185.4 mg/kg (P<0.05). In contrast, FUR at 100 mg/kg had no significant effect on the antielectroshock action of the remaining drugs tested (CBZ, LTG, OXC, PB, and TPM) in mice. Estimation of free plasma and total brain VPA concentrations revealed that the observed interaction between FUR and VPA in the MES test was pharmacodynamic in nature because neither free plasma nor total brain VPA concentrations were altered after i.p. administration of FUR. In conclusion, one can ascertain that the selective potentiation of the antielectroshock action of VPA by FUR and lack of any pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs, make this combination of pivotal importance for epileptic patients treated with VPA and received FUR from other than epilepsy reasons.",Excluded
672,"Total-body PET: Maximizing sensitivity to create new opportunities for clinical research and patient care PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article, we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET.

1738,"Vaccination of chicks against Plasmodium gallinaceum by erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic parasites attenuated by gamma irradiation Plasmodium gallinaceum-infected blood which received up to 24 krad during exposure to gamma-rays from a cobalt-60 source produced infections of normal course and duration when injected into chickens. The prepatent period advanced with increasing exposure of infected blood to radiation, suggesting some degree of attenuation. At 26, 28 and 30 krad, the infections were transient and the parasites were morphologically abnormal. It is thought that the amount of radiation required to render the parasites non-viable is about 45 krad for an inoculum of 10(6) parasites. There is evidence that exoerythrocytic stages may be more susceptible to gamma-rays than are blood parasites. Chickens were inoculated three times, over a period of four weeks, with vaccines prepared from gamma-irradiated infected blood and brain tissue. Half the birds which had been inoculated with attenuated parasitized blood exhibited mild infections during vaccination, and they were the only birds to show at challenge immunity to both homologous blood and exoerythrocytic parasites.",Included
1203,"Potential role for LINAC-based stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of 5 or more radioresistant melanoma brain metastases OBJECT: Linear accelerator (LINAC)-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment option for patients with melanoma in whom brain metastases have developed. Very limited data are available on treating patients with >=5 lesions. The authors sought to determine the effectiveness of SRS in patients with >=5 melanoma brain metastases.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of metastatic melanoma treated with SRS in a single treatment session for >=5 lesions was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were reviewed post-SRS to evaluate local control (LC). Disease progression on imaging was defined using the 2009 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Survival curves were calculated from the date of brain metastases diagnosis or the date of SRS by using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Univariate and multivariate analysis (UVA and MVA, respectively) were performed using the Cox proportional-hazards model.RESULTS: The authors identified 149 metastatic brain lesions treated in 28 patients. The median patient age was 60.5 years (range 38-83 years), and the majority of patients (24 [85.7%]) had extracranial metastases. Four patients (14.3%) had received previous whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and 11 (39.3%) had undergone previous SRS. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 0.34 cm3 (range 0.01-12.5 cm3). Median follow-up was 6.3 months (range 1-46 months). At the time of treatment, 7% of patients were categorized as recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class I, 89% as RPA Class II, and 4% as RPA Class III. The rate of local failure was 11.4%. Kaplan-Meier LC estimates at 6 and 12 months were 91.3% and 82.2%, respectively. A PTV volume>=0.34 cm3 was a significant predictor of local failure on UVA (HR 16.1, 95% CI 3.2-292.6, p<0.0001) and MVA (HR 14.8, 95% CI 3.0-268.5, p=0.0002). Sixteen patients (57.1%) were noted to have distant failure in the brain with a median time to failure of 3 months (range 1-15 months). Nine patients with distant failures received WBRT, and 7 received additional SRS. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.4 and 7.6 months from the date of brain metastases diagnosis and the date of SRS, respectively. The KM OS estimates at 6 and 12 months were 57.8% and 28.2%, respectively, from the time of SRS treatment. The RPA class was a significant predictor of KM OS estimates from the date of treatment (p=0.02). Patients who did not receive WBRT after SRS treatment had decreased OS on MVA (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-12.0, p=0.03), and patients who did not receive WBRT prior to SRS had improved OS (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.53, p=0.007).CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery for >=5 lesions appears to be effective for selected patients with metastatic melanoma, offering excellent LC. This is particularly important for patients as new targeted systemic agents are improving outcomes but still have limited efficacy within the central nervous system.",Excluded

2076,"Lu-177-Based Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy for Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a systemic cytotoxic radiation therapy using a compound of beta-emitting radionuclide chelated to a peptide for the treatment of tumor with overexpressed specific cell receptor such as somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) of neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Surgical resection should be performed for the curative treatment for NETs when it is feasible; however, a multi-disciplinary approach is needed when locally advanced or metastasized disease. PRRT with lutetium-177 (Lu-177)-labeled somatostatin analogues, as a new treatment modality targeting metastatic or inoperable NETs expressing the SSTR2, have been developed and successfully used for the past two decades. As Lu-177 emits both beta- and gamma-radiation, it has the ability as a theragnostic agent for NETs compared with only beta-emitting yttrium-90 labeled PRRT. Several recent studies reported that Lu-177 gave an overall positive response and improved the patients' quality of life. To fully exploit its potential, large comparative studies are needed for the assessment of distinct efficacies of Lu-177 labeled PRRT. Additionally, for extending the indications and developing new regimens of Lu-177-based PRRT, more dedicated clinical research is required.

1200,"Interaction between tissue oxygen tension and NADH imaging during synaptic stimulation and hypoxia in rat hippocampal slices Oxygen and NADH are essential components in the production of ATP in the CNS. This study examined the dynamic interaction between tissue oxygen tension (pO(2)) and NADH imaging changes within hippocampal tissue slices, during metabolic stresses including hypoxia and synaptic activation. The initiation of abrupt hypoxia (from 95% O(2) to 95% N(2)) caused a rapid decrease in pO(2), onset of hypoxic spreading depression (hsd; at 6.7+/-1.3 mm Hg; n=15), and a monophasic increase in NADH. Provided that reoxygenation was prompt, synaptic responses, pO(2) and NADH levels returned to baseline following hsd. Longer hypoxia caused irreversible neuronal dysfunction, an increase in pO(2) beyond baseline (due to decreased tissue demand), and hyperoxidation of NADH (10+/-2% decrease below baseline; n=7). Synaptic activation in ambient 95% O(2) caused a decrease or 'initial dip' in pO(2) and a biphasic NADH response (oxidation followed by reduction). The oxidizing phase of the NADH response was mitochondrial as it was synchronous with the 'initial' dip in pO(2). Following slow graded reductions in ambient oxygen levels to 8%, four of seven slices developed hsd following synaptic stimulation. The hypoxic threshold for graded oxygen reductions occurred at 7.9+/-5.8 mm Hg O(2) (n=7). Our hypoxic threshold range (6.7-7.9 mm Hg O(2) from abrupt and graded oxygen reduction, respectively) correlates well with reported in vivo values of <12 mm Hg O(2). The major findings of this study include: 1) determination of the critical physiological threshold of pO(2) (based upon hsd), which is a marker of imminent neuronal death if oxygen is not rapidly restored; 2) NADH hyperoxidation and an increase in pO(2) beyond baseline levels following longer periods of hypoxia; and 3) the occurrence of a pO(2) 'dip' during synaptic stimulation, which correlates with the early oxidizing phase of the biphasic NADH response.",Excluded
2598,"Optical Imaging of Beta-Amyloid Plaques in Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial, irreversible, and incurable neurodegenerative disease. The main pathological feature of AD is the deposition of misfolded beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) plaques in the brain. The abnormal accumulation of Abeta plaques leads to the loss of some neuron functions, further causing the neuron entanglement and the corresponding functional damage, which has a great impact on memory and cognitive functions. Hence, studying the accumulation mechanism of Abeta in the brain and its effect on other tissues is of great significance for the early diagnosis of AD. The current clinical studies of Abeta accumulation mainly rely on medical imaging techniques, which have some deficiencies in sensitivity and specificity. Optical imaging has recently become a research hotspot in the medical field and clinical applications, manifesting noninvasiveness, high sensitivity, absence of ionizing radiation, high contrast, and spatial resolution. Moreover, it is now emerging as a promising tool for the diagnosis and study of Abeta buildup. This review focuses on the application of the optical imaging technique for the determination of Abeta plaques in AD research.

2695,"Acute Effect of Low-Dose Space Radiation on Mouse Retina and Retinal Endothelial Cells There is concern that degradation of vision as a result of space flight may compromise both mission goals and long-term quality of life after space travel. The visual disturbances may be due to a combination of intracerebral pressure changes and exposure to ionizing radiation. The retina and the retinal vasculature play important roles in vision, yet have not been studied extensively in relationship to space travel and space radiation. The goal of the current study was to characterize oxidative damage and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells after whole-body gamma-ray, proton and oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O) ion radiation exposure at 0.1 to 1 Gy. Six-month-old male C57Bl/6J mice were whole-body irradiated with 600 MeV/n <sup>16</sup>O ions (0, 0.1, 0.25, 1 Gy), solar particle event (SPE)-like protons (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy) or <sup>60</sup>Co gamma rays (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy). Eyes were isolated for examining endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and characterization of apoptosis in retina and retinal endothelial cells at two weeks postirradiation. The expression of eNOS was significantly increased in the retina after proton and <sup>16</sup>O ion exposure. <sup>16</sup>O ions induced over twofold increase in eNOS expression compared to proton exposure at two weeks postirradiation ( P < 0.05). TUNEL assays showed dose-dependent increases in apoptosis in the retina after irradiation. Low doses of <sup>16</sup>O ions elicited apoptosis in the mouse retinal endothelial cells with the most robust changes observed after 0.1 Gy irradiation ( P < 0.05) compared to controls. Data also showed that <sup>16</sup>O ions induced a higher frequency of apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells compared to protons ( P < 0.05). In summary, our study revealed that exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the retina. Significant changes in retinal endothelial cells occur at doses as low as 0.1 Gy.

Method(s): Sixteen patients underwent fractionated proton therapy (PT) receiving dose to the healthy tissue because of direct or indirect (base skull tumors) irradiation. MWI was performed by a multi-echo sequence with 32 equally spaced echoes (10-320 ms). Decay data were processed to identify 3 T<inf>2</inf> compartments: myelin water (Mw) below 40 ms, intra-extracellular water (IEw) between 40 and 250 ms, and free water (CSFw) above 250 ms. Both MWI and DTI scans were acquired pre (pre)-treatment and immediately at the end (end) of PT. After image registration, voxel-wise difference maps, obtained by subtracting MWI and DTI pre from those acquired at the end of PT, were compared with the corresponding biological equivalent dose (BED). Result(s): Mw difference showed a positive correlation and IEw difference showed a negative correlation with BED considering end-pre changes (P <.01). The changes in CSFw were not significantly correlated with the delivered BED. The changes in DTI data, considering end-pre acquisitions, showed a positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and the delivered BED.

1269,"Complications of gamma knife neurosurgery and their appropriate management There are four main risks with Gamma Knife neurosurgery. Firstly, there are direct complications that would not have arisen if the patient had not undergone the specific treatment under consideration. For radiosurgery, the direct complications are radiation-induced damage to the tissues, which may be temporary or permanent. They may be expressed clinically or be clinically silent. In addition, there are complications that are specific to certain diseases and their locations, such as pituitary failure following treatment of pituitary adenomas and deafness, facial palsy, or trigeminal deficit following the treatment of vestibular schwannomas. Second, there are indirect or management-related complications arising from delayed control of the disease process, such as a re-bleed after treatment of a vascular lesion before its occlusion. Third, there is the risk of induction of neoplasia from irradiation of normal tissue or tumor. These are separate processes. An example of the first would be induction of a glioma after treatment of a vascular malformation. An example of the second would be induction of malignant change in a benign vestibular schwannoma.

Comparison of novel machine vision image guidance system with a 3D fluoroscopy-based platform for pedicle screw placement: a randomized prospective study of radiation, accuracy, and cost BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The use of image guidance and robotics platforms has increased patient safety, accuracy and operative efficiency and reduced revision rates during pedicle screw placement procedures. However, traditional intraoperative 3D or computational tomography (CT) imaging produces potentially harmful ionizing radiation and increases operative time to register the patient. An image guidance platform using machine vision through high resolution stereoscopic cameras and structured visible light does not use ionizing radiation while it builds a 3D topographical map of the patient's anatomy for navigation use. PURPOSE: We aimed to compare a novel machine vision image guidance system (MvIGS) system to a widely used 3D fluoroscopy (3D) platform by comparing radiation exposure, and pedicle screw accuracy. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A randomized prospective comparative cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing posterior lumbar instrumented fusion. PATIENT SAMPLE: Adults diagnosed with a spinal condition requiring surgical treatment and planning to have posterior open lumbar fusion with pedicle screws implanted into 1-4 vertebral levels. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included: mean intraoperative fluoroscopy time and dose, mean preoperative CT dose length product (DLP) and mean day 2 postoperative CT DLP, pedicle screw accuracy and rate of revision surgery. METHOD(S): Patients were randomized 1:1 to MvIGS or 3D and underwent posterior lumbar instrumented fusion. Radiation doses were recorded from pre- and postoperative CT and intraoperative fluoroscopy. Independent blinded radiologists reviewed pedicle screw accuracy. RESULT(S): A total of 303 (154 MvIGS, 149 3D) pedicle screws were placed in 63 patients (33 MvIGS, 30 3D) over the 12-month study period. Mean age and indication for surgery were similar between both groups. Mean intraoperative fluoroscopy time and doses were significantly reduced in MvIGS compared to 3D (5.2+/-4.1s vs 79.6+/-23.3s, p<0.001 and 133.0+/-215.8cGycm2 vs 3704.1+/-1640.5cGycm2, p<0.001, respectively). This represents a relative reduction of 93.5% in the total intraoperative time and 96.4% reduction in the total dose. Mean preoperative CT DLP and mean day 2 postoperative CT DLP were significantly reduced in MvIGS compared to 3D (590.8+/-389.6mGy*cm vs 1008.9+/-616.3mGy*cm, p<0.001 and 518.1+/-205.6mGy*cmvs 958.7+/-449.6mGy*cm, p<0.001, respectively). This represents a relative reduction of 41.4% and 46.0% relative reduction in the preoperative CT dose and postoperative total DLP, respectively. The MvIGS group required an average of 1.2 registrations each case with an average of 2447 (SD=961.3) data points registered with mean registration time of 106s (SD=52.1s). A rapid re-registration mechanism was utilized in 22% (n=7/33) of cases. Pedicle screw accuracy was high in both groups MvIGS (98.7%) vs 3D (97.3%) with no pedicle breach >2mm in either group (p>0.001). No neurovascular injuries occurred, and no patients needed return to theatre for screw repositioning. CONCLUSION(S): Both MvIGS and 3D image guidance platforms demonstrated high accuracy for pedicle screw placement. MvIGS demonstrated significant reduction of 93.5% and 96.4% in intraoperative radiation time and dose. MvIGS may provide similar accuracy to contemporary image guidance platforms without requiring 3D fluoroscopy or radiolucent operating tables. Reducing registration times and the need for specialized equipment may significantly reduce operating room costs.

373,"Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) improves learning after radiation stress Brain is highly susceptible to oxidative damage due to its high utilization of oxygen and rather poorly developed antioxidative defense mechanism. Free radicals formation is greatly augmented during ionizing radiation exposure, which causes damage in cerebellum responsible for locomotor activity. Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) having high content of beta-carotene (about 15 mg/100g), ascorbic acid, Vitamin C and folate, may prove efficient antioxidants. To evaluate its antioxidative efficacy, healthy Swiss albino mice from an inbred colony were selected and divided into three groups having equal number of male and female in each group. All of these animals were initially trained in Hebb William's Maze, model D(1). After initial training of 10 days, two groups were supplemented with methanolic extract of A. paniculatus (Linn.) at a dose of 600 and 800 mg/kg bw per day, respectively for 15 days. One group without any treatment served as normal. It has been observed that mice, supplemented with extract took lesser time to reach goal than normal (without any treatment). Furthermore after supplementation of Amaranthus, followed by exposure to 9 Gy of gamma radiation by 60Co beam therapy unit, the survived mice took lesser time to reach to their goals than those without plant extract. Control mice (not supplemented with AE extract) showed continuous decline in their learning performance. Mice of Control group died within 12 days after exposure. Irradiated males try to recover from 10th day onwards but they died up to day 12. But in Experimental mice (AE treated), after initial decline in learning ability after exposure, recovery was noticed and not only this 70% of them survived beyond the observation period. Besides male mice showed faster learning ability as compared to females in all groups. After irradiation too, males took lesser time to reach to goals. Learning in all the groups before exposure has been much faster in between 9 and 15 days. After radiation, however it was followed by a sudden spurt and delayed learning response up to 12 days. Recovery was greater in males than females in treated groups. Recovery was greater in males of 600 mg/kg bw per day than other groups. Learning has been almost at the same level from 14th day onward, which indicates that both the dose levels have been found equally effective.",Included
2492,"Using superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetics to manipulate the redox environment of neural precursor cells Past work has shown that neural precursor cells are predisposed to redox sensitive changes, and that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the acute and persistent changes that occur within the irradiated CNS. Irradiation leads to a marked rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that correlates with oxidative endpoints in vivo and reductions in neurogenesis. To better understand the impact of oxidative stress on neural precursor cells, and to determine if radiation-induced oxidative damage and precursor cell loss after irradiation could be reduced, a series of antioxidant compounds (EUK-134, EUK-163, EUK-172, EUK-189) were tested, three of which possess both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and one (EUK-163) whose only significant activity is SOD. Our results show that these SOD/catalase mimetics apparently increase the oxidation of a ROS-sensitive fluorescent indicator dye, particularly after short (12 h) treatments, but that longer treatments (24 h) decrease oxidation attributable to radiation-induced ROS. Similarly, other studies found that cells incubated with CuZnSOD showed some increase in intracellular ROS levels. Subsequent data suggested that the dye-oxidising capabilities of the EUK compounds were linked to differences in their catalase activity and, most likely, their ability to catalyse peroxidative pathways. In unirradiated mice, the EUK-134 analogue induced some decrease of proliferating precursor cells and immature neurons 48 h after radiation, an effect that may be attributable to cytotoxicity and/or inhibition of precursor proliferation. In irradiated mice, a single injection of EUK-134 was not found to be an effective radioprotector at acute times (48 h). The present results support continued development of our in vitro model as a tool for predicting certain in vivo responses, and suggest that in some biological systems the capability to scavenge superoxide but produce excess H(2)O(2), as is known for CuZnSOD, may be potentially deleterious. Our results also show that the ability of catalase mimetics, like true catalases, to catalyse peroxidase reactions can complicate the interpretation of data obtained with certain fluorescent ROS-indicator dyes.",Included
1936,"Terrestrial isopods congregate under a low-level beta-emitter source Ionizing radiation is ubiquitous, but very few experiments have investigated the biological effects of the natural background radiation at very low doses (>10 mGy/yr). We examined whether the background radiation, or radiation of a slightly higher level, has a role in evoking changes in behaviors of terrestrial isopods (woodlice). Upon exposure to a source giving 15 times the background level placed at one end of a box, a significant increase in the number of woodlice gathering under the beta-source was observed with time, as compared with the sham control. Terrestrial isopods have chemoreceptors (the olfactory system) on the terminal segment of their antennae. An additional experiment confirmed the involvement of these antennae in the radiation effect on behavior. After the excision of the antennae, no beta-taxis response was observed. The behavior of the group exposed to the source giving 30 times the background tended to decrease gradually in the area of the source, and the individuals aggregated in the area away from the source. Thus, the olfactory sensor in the antennae may be an important organ involved in the prompt response to radiation exposure, and the discrimination of the radiation field strengths of radioisotopes.",Included
2595,"Measurements and analysis of leakage neutron spectra from multiple-slab sample assemblies comprising W,U,C, and CH<inf>2</inf> with D-T neutron irradiation The accelerator driven subcritical system (ADS) is regarded as a safe and clean nuclear power system, which can be used for the transmutation of nuclear waste and the breeding of nuclear fuel. In this study, in order to validate nuclear data and the neutron transportation performance of the materials related to ADS, we measured the leakage neutron spectra from multiple-slab sample assemblies using 14.8 MeV D-T neutrons. Two types of assemblies comprising A-1 (W+U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) and A-2 (U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) were both built up gradually starting with the first wall. The measured spectra were compared with those calculated using the Monte Carlo code neutron transport coed (MCNP)-4C. A comparison of the results showed that the experimental leakage neutron spectra for both A-1 or A-2 were reproduced well by the three evaluated nuclear data libraries with discrepancies of less than 15% (A-1) and 12% (A-2), except when below 3 MeV. For 2-cm and 5-cm uranium samples, the CENDL-3.1 calculations exhibited large discrepancies in the energy range of 2-8 MeV and above 13 MeV. Thus, the CENDL-3.1 library for uranium should be reevaluated, especially around this energy range. It was significant that the leakage neuron spectra changed clearly when the latest material layer was added during the building of assemblies A-1 and A-2. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded

The width of the Gauss function was varied in 640 steps. Some parts of the transformation were extended, analysed and averaged in the frequency domain to explore oscillatory components of the impulse pattern. The sequences of action potentials of retinal ganglion cells evoked by short flashes are taken as examples. The present analysis demonstrate some properties of mathematical ""microscopic"" application to transient responses of the central nervous system (CNS), whereby the degree of magnification (steps of transformation) was varied.",Excluded
3012,"Indirect adaptive soft computing based wavelet-embedded control paradigms for WT/PV/SOFC in a grid/charging station connected hybrid power system This paper focuses on the indirect adaptive tracking control of renewable energy sources in a grid-connected hybrid power system. The renewable energy systems have low efficiency and intermittent nature due to unpredictable meteorological conditions. The domestic load and the conventional charging stations behave in an uncertain manner. To operate the renewable energy sources efficiently for harvesting maximum power, instantaneous nonlinear dynamics should be captured online. A Chebyshev-wavelet embedded NeuroFuzzy indirect adaptive MPPT (maximum power point tracking) control paradigm is proposed for variable speed wind turbine-permanent synchronous generator (VSWT-PMSG). A Hermite-wavelet incorporated NeuroFuzzy indirect adaptive MPPT control strategy for photovoltaic (PV) system to extract maximum power and indirect adaptive tracking control scheme for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) is developed. A comprehensive simulation test-bed for a grid-connected hybrid power system is developed in Matlab/Simulink. The robustness of the suggested indirect adaptive control paradigms are evaluated through simulation results in a grid-connected hybrid power system test-bed by comparison with conventional and intelligent control techniques. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control paradigms. Copyright Â© 2017 Mumtaz et al.

2313,"Comparison of internal dosimetry factors for three classes of adult computational phantoms with emphasis on I-131 in the thyroid The S values for 11 major target organs for I-131 in the thyroid were compared for three classes of adult computational human phantoms: stylized, voxel and hybrid phantoms. In addition, we compared specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) with the thyroid as a source region over a broader photon energy range than the x- and gamma-rays of I-131. The S and SAF values were calculated for the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference voxel phantoms and the University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms by using the Monte Carlo transport method, while the S and SAF values for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) stylized phantoms were obtained from earlier publications. Phantoms in our calculations were for adults of both genders. The 11 target organs and tissues that were selected for the comparison of S values are brain, breast, stomach wall, small intestine wall, colon wall, heart wall, pancreas, salivary glands, thyroid, lungs and active marrow for I-131 and thyroid as a source region. The comparisons showed, in general, an underestimation of S values reported for the stylized phantoms compared to the values based on the ICRP voxel and UF hybrid phantoms and relatively good agreement between the S values obtained for the ICRP and UF phantoms. Substantial differences were observed for some organs between the three types of phantoms. For example, the small intestine wall of ICRP male phantom and heart wall of ICRP female phantom showed up to eightfold and fourfold greater S values, respectively, compared to the reported values for the ORNL phantoms. UF male and female phantoms also showed significant differences compared to the ORNL phantom, 4.0-fold greater for the small intestine wall and 3.3-fold greater for the heart wall. In our method, we directly calculated the S values without using the SAFs as commonly done. Hence, we sought to confirm the differences observed in our S values by comparing the SAFs among the phantoms with the thyroid as a source region for selected target organs--small intestine wall, lungs, pancreas and breast--as well as illustrate differences in energy deposition across the energy range (12 photon energies from 0.01 to 4 MeV). Differences were found in the SAFs between phantoms in a similar manner as the differences observed in S values but with larger differences at lower photon energies. To investigate the differences observed in the S and SAF values, the chord length distributions (CLDs) were computed for the selected source--target pairs and compared across the phantoms. As demonstrated by the CLDs, we found that the differences between phantoms in those factors used in internal dosimetry were governed to a significant degree by inter-organ distances which are a function of organ shape as well as organ location.",Excluded
1866,"Procedural complexity independent of P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values is associated with acute in situ thrombosis in Pipeline flow diversion of cerebral aneurysms Background: Acute in situ thrombosis is an ischaemic phenomenon during Pipeline embolisation device (PED) procedures with potentially high morbidity and mortality. There is controversy regarding the role of platelet function testing with P2Y12 assay as a predictor of intraprocedural thromboembolic events. There is limited knowledge on whether procedural complexity influences these events.Methods: Data were collected retrospectively on 742 consecutive PED cases at a single institution. Patients with intraprocedural acute thrombosis were compared with patients without these events.Results: A cohort of 37 PED cases with acute in situ thrombosis (mean age 53.8 years, mean aneurysm size 8.4 mm) was matched with a cohort of 705 PED cases without intraprocedural thromboembolic events (mean age 56.4 years, mean aneurysm size 6.9 mm). All patients with in situ thrombosis received intra-arterial and/or intravenous abciximab. The two groups were evenly matched in patient demographics, previous treatment/subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and aneurysm location. There was no statistical difference in postprocedural P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values between the two groups, with a mean of 156 in the in situ thrombosis group vs 148 in the control group (p=0.5894). Presence of cervical carotid tortuosity, high cavernous internal carotid artery grade, need for multiple PED and vasospasm were not significantly different between the two groups. The in situ thrombosis group had statistically significant longer fluoroscopy time (60.4 vs 38.4 min, p<0.0001), higher radiation exposure (3476 vs 2160 mGy, p<0.0001), higher rates of adjunctive coiling (24.3% vs 8.37%, p=0.0010) and higher utilisation of balloon angioplasty (37.8% vs 12.2%, p<0.0001). Clinically, the in situ thrombosis cohort had higher incidence of major and minor stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage and length of stay.Conclusions: Predictors of procedural complexity (higher radiation exposure, longer fluoroscopy time, adjunctive coiling and need for balloon angioplasty) are associated with acute thrombotic events during PED placement, independent of PRU values.",Excluded

Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 595 NSCLC BM patients treated consecutively at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between 2013 to 2015. We assigned the patients into 4 dose groups of WBRT: none, < 30, 30-39, and >= 40 Gy and assessed their relationship with OS and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS). Cox models were utilized. Covariates included sex, age, KPS, BM lesions, extracranial metastasis, BM and lung tumor resection, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and focal radiotherapy modalities. Result(s): Patients had a mean age of 59 years and were 44% female. Their median survival time (MST) of OS and iPFS were 9.3 and 8.9 months. Patients receiving none (344/58%), < 30 (30/5%), 30-39 (93/16%), and >= 40 (128/22%) Gy of WBRT had MST of OS (iPFS) of 7.3 (6.8), 6.0 (5.4), 10.3 (11.9) and 11.9 (11.9) months, respectively. Compared to none, other WBRT groups had adjusted HRs for OS - 1.23 (p > 0.20), 0.72 (0.08), 0.61 (< 0.00) and iPFS - 1.63 (0.03), 0.71 (0.06), 0.67 (< 0.01). Compared to 30-39 Gy, WBRT dose >=40 Gy was not associated with improved OS and iPFS (all p > 0.40). Stratified analyses by 1-3 and >= 4 BM lesions and adjustment analyses by each prognostic index of RPA class, Lung-GPA and Lung-molGPA supported these relationships as well. Conclusion(s): Compared to none, WBRT doses >=30 Gy are invariably associated with improved intracranial tumor control and survival in NSCLC BM patients. Copyright Â© 2019 The Author(s).",Included

2700,"Space missions: psychological and psychopathological issues Exploring space is one of the most attractive goals that humanity ever set, notwithstanding, there are some psychological and psychopathological risks that should be considered. Several studies identified some possible hazards of space travels and related physical and psychological consequences on astronauts. If some psychological reactions are obviously inherent to the characteristics of the spaceships (habitability, confinement, psychological, and interpersonal relationships), other (disturbances of sleep-wake cycle, personality changes, depression, anxiety, apathy, psychosomatic symptoms, neurovestibular problems, alterations in cognitive function, and sensory perception) represent a clear warning of possible central nervous system (CNS) alterations, possibly due to microgravity and cosmic radiation. Such conditions and eventual CNS changes might compromise the success of missions and the ability to cope with unexpected events and may lead to individual and long-term impairments. Therefore, further studies are needed, perhaps, requiring the birth of a novel branch of psychology/psychiatry that should not only consider the risks related to space exploration, but the implementation of targeted strategies to prevent them.",Excluded
2502,"Treatment of spinal cord ependymomas by surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of complete resection and postoperative radiotherapy in spinal cord ependymomas. Methods and materials: We conducted a retrospective study over 20 patients (13 males and 7 females) with histologically confirmed spinal cord ependymomas between July 1985 and April 2001. Among them, 13 patients had ependymomas, 6 had myxopapillary ependymomas, and 1 had anaplastic ependymoma. All patients received radical surgery for tumor removal with 13 patients achieving complete resection and 7 incomplete resection due to technical difficulty. Among those with incomplete resection, 6 patients received postoperative radiotherapy to tumor bed and only one patient with anaplastic ependymoma received surgery alone. The total tumor dose ranged from 50 to 60 Gy. Result(s): Among the 20 patients, 19 patients were alive and showed local control. The median survival time of all patients was 109 months, with 104 months in the complete resection alone group and 135 months in the incomplete resection with postoperative radiotherapy group. One patient with anaplastic ependymoma and no postoperative radiotherapy developed leptomeningeal seeding 9 months after surgery. Salvage therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy maintained normal neurological functions. The patient expired 34 months from the initial diagnosis due to progression of leptomeningeal seeding. Conclusion(s): Complete resection alone in spinal cord ependymoma can achieve excellent local control and survival. Patients should receive complete resection if technically possible. Postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended for complete resection. For incomplete resection, postoperative local radiotherapy is recommended and it can also achieve excellent local control and survival. Local radiotherapy with 50-60 Gy is effective and safe. Salvage radiotherapy improves quality of life for local recurrence or leptomeningeal seeding patients. Â© Springer 2005.",Included

We demonstrate that both local tumor ionizing radiation (IR) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) treatment decreased tumor-induced Ter cell abundance in the mouse spleen and ARTN secretion outside the irradiation field in an interferon- and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent manner. Recombinant erythropoietin promoted resistance to radiotherapy or anti-PD-L1 therapies by restoring Ter cell numbers and serum ARTN concentration. Blockade of ARTN or potential ARTN signaling partners, or depletion of Ter cells augmented the antitumor effects of both IR and anti-PD-L1 therapies in mice. Analysis of samples from patients who received radioimmunotherapy demonstrated that IR-mediated reduction of Ter cells, ARTN, and GFRalpha3, an ARTN signaling partner, were each associated with tumor regression. Patients with melanoma who received immunotherapy exhibited favorable outcomes associated with decreased expression of GFRalpha3. These findings demonstrate an out-of-field, or ""abscopal,"" effect mediated by adaptive immunity, which is induced during local tumor irradiation. This effect, in turn, governs the therapeutic effects of radiation and immunotherapy.

797,"Locomotion and eating behavior changes in Yucatan minipigs after unilateral radio-induced ablation of the caudate nucleus The functional roles of the Caudate nucleus (Cd) are well known. Selective Cd lesions can be found in neurological disorders. However, little is known about the dynamics of the behavioral changes during progressive Cd ablation. Current stereotactic radiosurgery technologies allow the progressive ablation of a brain region with limited adverse effects in surrounding normal tissues. This could be of high interest for the study of the modified behavioral functions in relation with the degree of impairment of the brain structures. Using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy combined with synchrotron microbeam radiation, we investigated, during one year after irradiation, the effects of unilateral radio-ablation of the right Cd on the behavior of Yucatan minipigs. The right Cd was irradiated to a minimal dose of 35.5 Gy delivered in three fractions. MRI-based morphological brain integrity and behavioral functions, i.e. locomotion, motivation/hedonism were assessed. We detected a progressive radio-necrosis leading to a quasi-total ablation one year after irradiation, with an additional alteration of surrounding areas. Transitory changes in the motivation/hedonism were firstly detected, then on locomotion, suggesting the influence of different compensatory mechanisms depending on the functions related to Cd and possibly some surrounding areas. We concluded that early behavioral changes related to eating functions are relevant markers for the early detection of ongoing lesions occurring in Cd-related neurological disorders.",Included
1602,"Thermoregulation in pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana, Ord) in winter Conservation of energy is a prerequisite thermoregulatory strategy for survival in northern hemisphere winters. We have used thermistor/data logger assemblies to measure temperatures in the brain, carotid artery, jugular vein and abdominal cavity, in pronghorn antelope to determine their winter body temperature and to investigate whether the carotid rete has a survival role. Over the study period mean black globe and air temperature were -0.5+/-3.2 degrees C and -2.0+/-3.4 degrees C, respectively, and mean daytime solar radiation was approximately 186 W m(-2). Brain temperature (T(brain), 39.3+/-0.3 degrees C) was higher than carotid blood temperature (T(carotid), 38.5+/-0.4 degrees C), and higher than jugular temperature (T(jugular), 37.9+/-0.7 degrees C). Minimum T(brain) (38.5+/-0.4 degrees C) and T(carotid) (37.8+/-0.2 degrees C) in winter were higher than the minimum T(brain) (37.7+/-0.5 degrees C) and T(carotid) (36.4+/-0.8 degrees C) in summer that we have reported previously. Compared with summer, winter body temperature patterns were characterized by an absence of selective brain cooling (SBC), a higher range of T(brain), a range of T(carotid) that was significantly narrower (1.8 degrees C) than in summer (3.1 degrees C), and changes in T(carotid) and T(brain) that were more highly correlated (r=0.99 in winter vs r=0.83 in summer). These findings suggest that in winter the effects of the carotid rete are reduced, which eliminates SBC and prevents independent regulation of T(brain), thus coupling T(brain) to T(carotid). The net effect is that T(carotid) varies little. A possible consequence is depression of metabolism, with the survival advantage of conservation of energy. These findings also suggest that the carotid rete has wider thermoregulatory effects than its traditional SBC function.",Excluded
2214,"Ionizing radiation alters the expression of multifunctional immune-modulatory protein HLA-E in glioblastoma cells lines: An unrecognized effect of radiation therapy? Background: Immune-modulatory proteins HLA-G and HLA-E were originally thought to be restricted to the protection of the fetus from maternal allorecognition. Now they are known for multiple immune-regulatory functions. We already described production of immune-modulatory molecules HLA-G and HLA-E by both microglial cells (Kren, L. et al., J Neuroimmunol 2010) and neoplastic cells (Kren, L. et al. Neuropathology 2011). We described the unexpected positive correlation of HLA-E expression by neoplastic cells in glioblastoma (GB) with the length of survival, which we hypothetized could be attributable to subsequent therapeutic modalities. Therefore, we decided to analyse the expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in three GB cell lines before and after the impact of ionizing radiation. Design(s): We used three GB cell lines: T 98G, A172 and U 87MG. The expression of HLA-G and HLA-E was assessed before application of ionizing radiation (0-2-5-10-15- 20 Gy) and then was analysed again 24h and 72 h after radiation. HLA-G and HLA-E antigens were analysed flow-cytometrically. Result(s): The expression of both HLA-G and HLA-E by all three cell lines of GB was elevated significantly after irradiation, expecially expression of HLA-E in the line T 98G. (Graph Presented) Conclusion(s): We revealed that expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in GB cell lines alters significantly after the impact of ionizing radiation. This finding may represent a new, unrecognized pathway of the effect of ionizing radiation in cancer therapy.

Hydrophone transducers were implanted in the models to record the microwave-induced mechanical vibrations. Four properly timed radar pulses produced a threefold increase in the acoustical amplitudes in the muscle model.

After irradiation, the rats were randomized to the radiation only control group and the Ramipril-treated (radiation + Ramipril) experimental group. Ramipril 1.5 mg/kg/day was given in the drinking water starting 1 week after radiation through the study duration.RESULTS: All the rats irradiated with 28.5-33 Gy became paralyzed at 125 +/- 4 days, whereas no rats became paralyzed after 23.6 Gy. The time to develop paralysis was delayed to 135 +/- 4 days in Ramipril-treated group (P < 0.001). H&E and LFB showed microscopic structural restoration and remyelination with Ramipril treatment. VEGF expression was increased in the irradiated spinal cord, and the number of VEGF-positive cells was significantly decreased by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.001). Immunohistochemical stain with Iba-1 showed increased microglial infiltration in the irradiated spinal cords. The number of Iba-1-positive microglia was significantly reduced by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Ramipril reduced the rate of paralysis even at the paralysis-inducing radiation doses. It also significantly delayed the onset of paralysis. Neuroinflammation and endothelial cell damage may be the key mediators of radiation injury. Ramipril can be readily translatable to clinical application as a mitigatory of radiotherapeutic toxicity.",Excluded
3303,"Blocking GABAA neurotransmission in the interposed nuclei: effects on conditioned and unconditioned eyeblinks The interposed nuclei (IN) of the intermediate cerebellum are critical components of the circuits that control associative learning of eyeblinks and other defensive reflexes in mammals. The IN, which represent the sole output of the intermediate cerebellum, receive massive GABAergic input from Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex and are thought to contribute to the acquisition and performance of classically conditioned eyeblinks. The specific role of deep cerebellar nuclei and the cerebellar cortex in eyeblink conditioning are not well understood. One group of studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN altered the time profile of conditioned responses (CRs), suggesting that the main function of the cerebellar cortex is to shape the timing of CRs. Other studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN abolished CRs, indicating a more fundamental involvement of the cerebellar cortex in CR generation. When examining this controversy, we hypothesized that the behavioral effect of GABA(A) blockers could be dose-dependent. The IN of classically conditioned rabbits were injected with high and low doses of picrotoxin and gabazine. Both GABA(A) blockers produced tonic eyelid closure. A high dose of both drugs abolished CRs, whereas a less complete block of GABA(A)-mediated inputs with substantially smaller drug doses shortened CR latencies. In addition, low doses of picrotoxin facilitated the expression of unconditioned eyeblinks evoked by trigeminal stimulation. These results suggest that the intermediate cerebellum regulates both associative and non-associative components of the eyeblink reflex, and that behavioral effects of blocking Purkinje cell action on IN neurons are related to collective changes in cerebellar signals and in the excitability of extra-cerebellar eyeblink circuits.",Excluded

She reported a similar episode 1 week prior after which her vision recovered, as well as a month-long history of left-sided temporal headaches associated with photosensitivity. Review of systems was positive for episodic paresthesias of bilateral forearms, hands, and feet. She denied constitutional symptoms, rash, joint pain, and drug use of any kind. Family history was remarkable for father with ocular migraine, and grandparents with rheumatoid arthritis and neurosarcoidosis. Exam revealed a left monocular lower quandrantanopsia, normal venous pulsations, no cherry red spot and a normal neurological exam. An extensive rheumatic and infectious workup was negative, including a hypercoaguability panel, antinuclear antibody, ESR, CRP, and hemoglobin evaluation. A brain MRI/MRA without contrast showed patent bilateral ophthalmic arteries. Face and neck MRI with contrast, transthoracic echocardiography with bubble study, electromyography, as well as nerve conduction studies were all unremarkable. Given the negative workup, the presumable etiology was thought to be vasospasm with migraine. She was started on low dose aspirin for secondary stroke prevention, and propranolol for migraine prophylaxis. IMPACT: This case highlights the clinical manifestations of retinal artery occlusion, as well as the possible etiologies of retinal artery occlusion. Workup should be tailored to an age appropriate differential. DISCUSSION: Overall, central and branch retinal artery occlusions (CRAO and BRAO) are rare with an incidence of approximately 1 to 10 in 100,000, with an affected mean age of 60-65 years. The etiology varies with age, with carotid artery atherosclerosis being most common overall, as high as 70%; however, for patients less than 40 years of age, cardiogenic embolism is much more likely. Therefore, workup for younger patients should be focused on evaluating for sources of cardiogenic embolism such as arrhythmias, murmurs, congenital heart disease, and substance abuse. For older patients, temporal arteritis should be ruled out. Vascular diseases such as fibromuscular dysplasia, radiation injury, or hematologic diseases including sickle cell anemia, hypercoagulable states, and hyperviscosity syndrome can affect all ages and should be investigated if other causes are excluded. Rare causes of CRAO/BRAO include infections due to Bartonella, toxoplasmosis, and varicella; ocular surgery; fat or amniotic fluid embolism; and vasospasm with or without migraine, which is a diagnosis of exclusion. There have only been case studies describing CRAO associated with vasculitis.",Excluded

Inclusion criteria for this study were (1) no ED according to a self-administered questionnaire before PB, (2) treatment with PB alone (125I; 144 Gy), (3) postimplant CT scan of the prostate 1 month after PB, and (4) minimum of 24 months of continuous follow-up. Fifty men met all inclusion criteria. ED was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire completed before and at each follow-up visit after LDRPB. Radiation doses to the NVB and PB were calculated on the basis of axial postimplant CT images. Multiple variables (patient-related and dosimetric quantifiers) that may predict for the development of ED were examined by univariate analysis.RESULTS: Thirty of the 50 men (60%) were potent at last follow-up.

The calculated mean maximum doses to the NVB and PB were 684 Gy (range, 195-1277 Gy) and 498 Gy (range, 44-971 Gy), respectively. The mean calculated doses to 50% of the NVB and PB were 158 Gy (range, 76-240 Gy) and 43 Gy (range, 19-101 Gy), respectively. The calculated mean maximum, mean minimum, and mean doses to 50% of the NVB or PB did not differ between those men who developed ED and those men who did not develop ED. None of the dosimetric variables examined predicted the development of ED after LDRPB.CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, higher calculated doses to the NVB or PB are not associated with ED after LDRPB.",Excluded
1854,"Enhanced excitability induced by ionizing radiation in the kindled rat Evidence derived from both clinical and experimental investigations has suggested an influence of ionizing radiation on focal epileptogenicity. To better characterize this influence we applied focal ionizing radiation to a kindled epileptic focus in the rat amygdala. The right and left basolateral amygdala and right frontal cortex were implanted with concentric bipolar electrodes. Rats were kindled through a minimum of 10 stage 5 seizures by afterdischarge-threshold electrostimulation of the left amygdala, after which generalized seizure thresholds were determined prior to irradiation. The left amygdala was exposed to single-fraction central-axis doses of either 18 or 25 Gy using a beam-collimated (60)Co source (1.25 MeV). Generalized seizure thresholds were then redetermined at weekly intervals for 10 weeks and at monthly intervals for an additional 3 months. We observed no significant changes in seizure threshold during the postirradiation interval; however, we did observe persistent changes in seizure dynamics manifesting within the first week postirradiation. These consisted of an increased tendency for seizure activity to propagate into brain stem circuits during the primary ictus (i.e., ""running fits"") and an increased tendency for secondary convulsions to emerge postictally. These effects involving seizure dynamics have not been reported previously and appear to represent a radiation-induced disinhibition of one or more neural circuits. The disparity between these effects and earlier reports of seizure-suppressive effects resulting from analogous radiation exposures is discussed in relation to kindling and status epilepticus-induced pathogenesis within the hippocampus.",Included
306,"Visible light modulates the expression of cancer-retina antigens Proteins involved in the visual signaling cascade show light-dependent expression levels in photoreceptor cells. Recently, these proteins have been described to be expressed in neuroectodermal tumors and to function as cancer-retina antigens. Here, we show that light can down-regulate gene expression of rhodopsin, transducin, and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) and up-regulate guanylyl cyclase 1, recoverin, and arrestin in human melanoma cells in vitro, comparable to physiologic changes earlier observed in photoreceptor cells. Similar modulation can be detected at the protein level in melanoma cells except for no changes in PDE6 protein levels. Two regulatory pathways have been identified: Sp1/Sp3/Sp4 proteins for rhodopsin and PDE6, and mitogen-activated protein kinases for recoverin and arrestin. The visual cascade and retinoic acid as its derivate do not play any role in this process. Putative explanations for light-dependent modulation of cancer-retina antigen expression in melanoma cells are discussed.",Excluded
3051,"Brain MRI characteristics and scoring in adult onset krabbe disease Introduction: Krabbe disease is a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease due to decreased galactocerebrosidase activity. Adult onset is rare, however probably underdiagnosed. Brain MRI showing a leukodystrophy is of great value to achieve diagnosis. We aimed at performing for the first time a systematic analysis of brainMRI features in adult onset Krabbe disease (>10 years old). Method(s): We collected the first available brain MRI of patients seen in the reference center for lysosomal diseases. We also contacted authors of published articles describing adult onset Krabbe disease patients and ask them to share brain MRI data. A score was established to describe the brain MRIs, with quantification according to severity (from 0 to 4 for nonfascicular structures and from 0 to 2 for fascicular structures). Two neuroradiologists first scored separately the MRIs, then reached a consensus for final scoring. Result(s): Thirteen patients were included in the study. Pyramidal tract was the most frequent structure showing abnormal T2 hypersignal (100% of patients), however with some distinctions along the tractus: medial precentral gyrus (100% of patients, mean score 2.8/4), lateral precentral gyrus (77%, 1.77/4), and corona radiata (100%, 1.7/2) were highly abnormal whereas internal capsula (69%, 0.96/2), mesencephalon (46%, 0.69/2), pons (31%, 0.42/2), and spinal bulb (0%, 0/2) were quite spared. Other sus tentorial white matter (WM) localizations were also found abnormal: occipital WM (92%, 2.15/ 4), optic radiations (69%, mean score 1.03/2), frontalWM(69%, 1.5/4), temporal WM (61%, 1.15/4), and parietal WM (15%, 0.23/4). 9/13 patients (69%) had corpus callosum hypersignal especially in isthmus (69%, mean score 1.38/2), body (38%, 0.77/2), and splenium (31%, 0.61/2), whereas genu was always normal. Finally, medial lemniscus was the most frequent abnormal structure found in posterior fossa (9/13 patients, 69%, mean score 0.96/2). Conclusion(s): Upper pyramidal tract, occipital WM, optic radiations, corpus callosum isthmus, and median lemniscus were the structures most frequently found with abnormal T2 hypersignals.

1698,"Quantitative analysis of calcium-dependent vesicle recruitment and its functional role at the calyx of Held synapse Recruitment of release-ready vesicles at synapses is one of the important factors, which determine dynamic properties of signaling between neurons in the brain. It has been shown that the rate of vesicle recruitment is accelerated by strong synaptic activity. An elevated concentration of calcium ions in the presynaptic terminal ([Ca2+]i) has been proposed to be responsible for this effect. However, the precise relationship between [Ca2+]i and recruitment has not been established yet, and the functional consequences of accelerated recruitment during synaptic activity have not been quantified experimentally. To probe the intracellular Ca2+ dependence of vesicle recruitment and to examine its functional role during trains of action potential (AP)-like stimuli, we monitored [Ca2+]i and synaptic responses simultaneously with paired recordings at the calyx of Held synapse. We found that a distinct, rapidly releasing vesicle pool is replenished with a rate that increases linearly with [Ca2+]i, without any apparent cooperativity. The slope factor for this increase is approximately 1 pool/(microM x s). Blocking Ca2+-dependent recruitment specifically with a calmodulin binding peptide revealed that the steady-state EPSCs during 100 Hz AP-like trains were maintained through this Ca2+-dependent recruitment mechanism. Using a simple model of vesicle dynamics, we estimated that the recruitment rate accelerated 10-fold during the steady-state compared with the rate at resting [Ca2+]i. We could also demonstrate an approximate sixfold increase in release probability (facilitation) during the initial 5-15 AP-like stimuli of such trains in our experimental condition, regardless of EPSC depression.",Excluded
667,"Cellular Senescence in Mouse Hippocampus After Irradiation and the Role of p53 and p21 Diverse stress signals including irradiation may trigger cellular senescence. We asked whether irradiation induced senescence in mouse hippocampus, and whether p53 or p21 played a role in this response. Following whole-brain irradiation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays for senescence-associated genes showed increased expression of CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p19ARF) in mouse hippocampus at 9 weeks. Upregulation of p21 and p19ARF was confirmed using real-time PCR, which also demonstrated increased CDKN2A/p16INKa expression after irradiation. No altered regulation of another 17 senescence-associated genes was observed after irradiation. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased nuclear expression of p16INK4A, p19ARF, p53, p21, phosphorylated p38 (pp38), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and interleukin-6 (IL6) in granule cells of dentate gyrus after irradiation. Increased p16 nuclear immunoreactivity was further observed in type -1 cells, the putative neural stem cells. gamma-phosphorylated-histone-2A nuclear foci were also seen in dentate gyrus 9 weeks postirradiation. In nonirradiated mice knockout of the TRP53 or p21 gene, there was increased p16INK4A, p19ARF, and IL6, but not pp38 in dentate gyrus. We conclude that irradiation induces transcript and protein expression profile alterations in mouse dentate gyrus consistent with the senescence phenotype. Absence of p53 or p21 results in increase in baseline expression of senescence markers with no further increase in expression after irradiation.",Included
1206,"Local irradiation not only induces homing of human mesenchymal stem cells at exposed sites but promotes their widespread engraftment to multiple organs: A study of their quantitative distribution after irradiation damage Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to migrate to various tissues. There is little information on the fate and potential therapeutic efficacy of the reinfusion of MSCs following total body irradiation (TBI). We addressed this question using human MSC (hMSCs) infused to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to TBI. Further, we tested the impact of additional local irradiation (ALI) superimposed to TBI, as a model of accidental irradiation. NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with hMSCs. Group 1 was not irradiated before receiving hMSC infusion. Group 2 received only TBI at a dose of 3.5 Gy, group 3 received local irradiation to the abdomen at a dose of 4.5 Gy in addition to TBI, and group 4 received local irradiation to the leg at 26.5 Gy in addition to TBI. Fifteen days after irradiation, quantitative and spatial distribution of the hMSCs were studied. Histological analysis of mouse tissues confirmed the presence of radio-induced lesions in the irradiated fields. Following their infusion into nonirradiated animals, hMSCs homed at a very low level to various tissues (lung, bone marrow, and muscles) and no significant engraftment was found in other organs. TBI induced an increase of engraftment levels of hMSCs in the brain, heart, bone marrow, and muscles. Abdominal irradiation (AI) as compared with leg irradiation (LI) increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (the gut, liver, and spleen). Hind LI as compared with AI increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (skin, quadriceps, and muscles). An increase of hMSC engraftment in organs outside the fields of the ALI was also observed. Conversely, following LI, hMSC engraftment was increased in the brain as compared with AI. This study shows that engraftment of hMSCs in NOD/SCID mice with significantly increased in response to tissue injuries following TBI with or without ALI. ALI induced an increase of the level of engraftment at sites outside the local irradiation field, thus suggesting a distant (abscopal) effect of radiation damage. This work supports the use of MSCs to repair damaged normal tissues following accidental irradiation and possibly in patients submitted to radiotherapy. Â©AlphaMed Press.",Excluded
1239,"Induced radioactivity in the blood of cancer patients following Boron Neutron Capture Therapy Since 1990, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) has been used for over 400 cancer patients at the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURRI). After BNCT, the patients are radioactive and their (24)Na and (38)Cl levels can be detected via a Na-I scintillation counter. This activity is predominantly due to (24)Na, which has a half-life of 14.96 h and thus remains in the body for extended time periods. Radioactive (24)Na is mainly generated from (23)Na in the target tissue that is exposed to the neutron beam in BNCT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the radioactivity of blood (24)Na following BNCT and the absorbed gamma ray dose in the irradiated field. To assess blood (24)Na, 1 ml of peripheral blood was collected from 30 patients immediately after the exposure, and the radioactivity of blood (24)Na was determined using a germanium counter. The activity of (24)Na in the blood correlated with the absorbed gamma ray doses in the irradiated field. For the same absorbed gamma ray dose in the irradiated field, the activity of blood (24)Na was higher in patients with neck or lung tumors than in patients with brain or skin tumors. The reasons for these findings are not readily apparent, but the difference in the blood volume and the ratio of bone to soft tissue in the irradiated field, as well as the dose that leaked through the clinical collimator, may be responsible.",Excluded

Diffusion signal decay within brain white matter was fit to a biexponential model to separate changes within the slow and fast components.

Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a practical technique which is sensitive to veins, especially tiny veins. Our purpose of this study was to evaluate the visualization of the venous network of brainstem by using SWI at 3.0 T. Method(s): The occurrence rate of each superficial veins of brainstem was evaluated by using SWI on a 3 T MR imaging system in 60 volunteers. The diameter of the lateral mesencephalic vein and peduncular vein were measured by SWI using the reconstructed mIP images in the sagittal view. And the outflow of the veins of brainstem were studied and described according to the reconstructed images. Result(s): The median anterior pontomesencephalic vein, median anterior medullary vein, peduncular vein, right vein of the pontomesencephalic sulcus, and right lateral anterior pontomesencephalic vein were detected in all the subjects (100 %). The outer diameter of peduncular vein was 1.38 +/- 0.26 mm (range 0.8-1.8 mm). The lateral mesencephalic vein was found in 75 % of the subjects and the mean outer diameter was 0.81 +/- 0.2 mm (range 0.5-1.2 mm). The inner veins of mesencephalon were found by using SWI.

225,"SPECT/CT hybrid imaging; with which CT? AIM: The aim of this study is to show the practical use of, and to discuss the rationale for, high-end computed tomography (CT) integrated with intrinsic low-resolution single-photon emission tomography (SPECT).MATERIALS AND METHODS: All examinations performed on three new SPECT/CT systems with diagnostic CT capabilities were recorded retrospectively. The use of CT was classified as low-dose, using the CT with restraint as to the tube current and radiation dose, or diagnostic, with an optimum use of the CT, using CT protocols as used in ordinary radiological practice. The number of low-dose CT was compared with the number of diagnostic CT examinations. The report is based on 436 patient examinations from three hospitals in Norway with recently installed SPECT/CT systems, the time of use varying from 6 months to 2 years. The examinations performed were myocardial perfusion (45%), various tumors (thyroid, parathyroid, neuroendocrine 37%), malignant skeletal disease (12%), brain perfusion (4%), sentinel nodes in breast cancer (1%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (1%).RESULTS: Of the 436 patients, 431 had a low-dose CT for attenuation correction, anatomic localisation and, also for diagnosis, whereas five patients had a diagnostic CT. In these series, as was found in recent literature, the diagnostic potential of the CT was seldom used to its capacity and always in predetermined diagnostic situations.CONCLUSION: There is a low degree of utilization of the diagnostic capabilities of the CT in the SPECT/CT context, for a number of reasons. This raises questions about the cost-benefit of investing in high-end CT for SPECT/CT applications.",Excluded

909,"Long INterspersed element-1 mobility as a sensor of environmental stresses Long INterspersed element (LINE-1, L1) retrotransposons are the most abundant transposable elements in the human genome, constituting approximately 17%. They move by a ""copy-paste"" mechanism, involving reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate and insertion of its cDNA copy at a new site in the genome. L1 retrotransposition (L1-RTP) can cause insertional mutations, alter gene expression, transduce exons, and induce epigenetic dysregulation. L1-RTP is generally repressed; however, a number of observations collected over about 15 years revealed that it can occur in response to environmental stresses. Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that L1-RTP can play a role in the onset of several neurological and oncological diseases in humans. In recent years, great attention has been paid to the exposome paradigm, which proposes that health effects of an environmental factor should be evaluated considering both cumulative environmental exposures and the endogenous processes resulting from the biological response. L1-RTP could be an endogenous process considered for this application. Here, we summarize the current understanding of environmental factors that can affect the retrotransposition of human L1 elements. Evidence indicates that L1-RTP alteration is triggered by numerous and various environmental stressors, such as chemical agents (heavy metals, carcinogens, oxidants, and drugs), physical agents (ionizing and non-ionizing radiations), and experiential factors (voluntary exercise, social isolation, maternal care, and environmental light/dark cycles). These data come from in vitro studies on cell lines and in vivo studies on transgenic animals: future investigations should be focused on physiologically relevant models to gain a better understanding of this topic.",Excluded
3093,"Significance of histology in determining management of lesions regrowing after radiosurgery Brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery may show delayed enlargement on post-treatment imaging that is of ambiguous etiology. Histopathologic interpretation of brain specimens is often challenging due to the presence of significant radiation effects admixed with irradiated residual tumor of indeterminate viability. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of histologic findings on clinical outcomes following resection of these lesions. Between 2004 and 2010, 690 patients with brain metastases were enrolled in a prospective gamma knife data repository, and lesions requiring excision were identified. Tissue specimens were divided into four groups based on the ratio of treatment related inflammatory changes (TRIC) to tumor cells, and subsequently patient outcomes were assessed. Of 2,583 metastases treated, 36 were excised due to symptomatic enlargement. Only TRIC, without residual evidence of tumor, was seen in 36 % (13/36) of specimens. Resection of these lesions resulted in 100 % local control in follow-up. Of the remaining 23 lesions that contained any viable-appearing tumor within the resected specimen, 8 recurred after resection. Lesions that enlarged in the first 6 months were more likely to contain higher amounts of residual tumor cells. Patients with even <2 % tumors cells on excision had significantly worse local control (75 vs. 100 %, p = 0.024) and survival (HR 0.27, p = 0.029) compared with those patients with exclusively TRIC. In summary, our findings underscore the importance of surgically obtaining tissue in a method that facilitates complete lesional interpretive histology in order to accurately guide ongoing patient management.",Excluded
1284,"Vestibular adaptation to centrifugation does not transfer across planes of head rotation Out-of-plane head movements performed during fast rotation produce non-compensatory nystagmus, sensations of illusory motion, and often motion sickness. Adaptation to this cross-coupled Coriolis stimulus has previously been demonstrated for head turns made in the yaw (transverse) plane of motion, during supine head-on-axis rotation. An open question, however, is if adaptation to head movements in one plane of motion transfers to head movements performed in a new, unpracticed plane of motion. Evidence of transfer would imply the brain builds up a generalized model of the vestibular sensory-motor system, instead of learning a variety of individual input/output relations separately. To investigate, over two days 9 subjects performed pitch head turns (sagittal plane) while rotating, before and after a series of yaw head turns while rotating. A Control Group of 10 subjects performed only the pitch movements. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and sensations of illusory motion were recorded in the dark for all movements. Upon comparing the two groups we failed to find any evidence of transfer from the yaw plane to the pitch plane, suggesting that adaptation to cross-coupled stimuli is specific to the particular plane of head movement. The findings have applications for the use of centrifugation as a possible countermeasure for long duration spaceflight. Adapting astronauts to unconstrained head movements while rotating will likely require exposure to head movements in all planes and directions. Â© 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

Recently, we identified that translocation of the mu-splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSmu) and downstream activation of FoxO3a were redox-sensitive phenomena. Prospective sources or reactive oxygen species (ROS) include mitochondria and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2). We tested the causal role of Nox2 in unloading induced atrophy using a peptidyl inhibitor (gp91ds-tat) with the following groups: ambulatory controls (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 7 days with scrambled sequence (HUScr), and unloading for 7 days + 5 mg/kg/day gp91dsTAT (HUG). Nox2 inhibition provided significant against HU-induced reduction of plantarflexor muscle mass and soleus muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), measured using ImageJ and SMASH programs. There was a trend towards protection against a partial shift in fiber-type shift from slow to fast twitch. Loss of sarcolemmal nNOSmu activity with HU, visualized using NADPH diaphorase and confirmed with immunofluorescence were also mitigated by gp91dsTAT. Gp91dsTAT also attenuated membrane localization of the Nox2 subunit p67phox. We conclude that Nox2 inhibition protects against muscle fiber atrophy and translocation of nNOSmu.",Excluded
1737,"Treatment decisions in a man with Hodgkin lymphoma and Guillian-Barre syndrome: A case report Introduction: Guillain-Barre syndrome, or acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, has been described in the presence of malignancies such as lymphoma. Guillain-Barre syndrome/acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy causes paresthesias and weakness, which can make the treatment of lymphoma with chemotherapy challenging. Given the rarity of this co-presentation it is not known if the effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome should be considered when selecting a treatment regimen for Hodgkin lymphoma. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of these treatment modifications has not been previously reported. Case presentation: We report the case of a 37-year-old Caucasian man with a diagnosis of stage IIB classical Hodgkin lymphoma with concomitant Guillain-Barre syndrome. Our patient originally presented with an enlarged cervical lymph node and quickly developed distal paresthesia and progressive weakness of all four extremities. He was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and initiated on treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. Doses of bleomycin and vinblastine were held or dose-reduced throughout his initial treatment course due to underlying neuropathy and dyspnea. He continued to have persistent disease after five cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine and went on to receive salvage treatments including more chemotherapy, radiation, autologous stem cell transplant and is currently preparing for an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Conclusion(s): Paraneoplastic syndromes such as Guillain-Barre syndrome/acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy can make the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma more challenging and can interfere with delivering full-dose chemotherapy. Further case series are needed to evaluate the effect that paraneoplastic syndromes, or adjustments made in therapy due to these syndromes, negatively affect the prognosis of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

2379,"A semianalytic model to investigate the potential applications of x-ray scatter imaging Although x-ray scatter is generally regarded as a nuisance that reduces radiographic contrast (C) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in conventional images, many technologies have been devised to extract useful information from the scattered x rays. A systematic approach, however, for analyzing the potential applications of x-ray scatter imaging has been lacking. Therefore, we have formulated a simple but useful semianalytic model to investigate C and SNR in scatter images. Our model considers the imaging of a target object against a background material of the same dimensions when both are situated within a water phantom. We have selected biological materials (liver, fat, bone, muscle, blood, and brain matter) for which intermolecular form factors for coherent scattering were available. Analytic relationships between C and SNR were derived, and evaluated numerically as the target object thickness (0.01-40 mm) and photon energy (10-200 keV) were systematically varied. The fundamental limits of scatter imaging were assessed via calculations that assumed that all first-order scatter exiting the phantom, over 4pi steradians, formed the signal. Calculations for a restricted detector solid angle were then performed. For the task of imaging white brain matter versus blood in a 15 cm thick water phantom, the maximum SNR, over all energies, for images based on the detection of all forward scatter within the angular range 2degree- 12degreeis greater than that of primary images for target object thicknesses <= 23 mm. Use of the backscattered x rays within the range 158degree-178degreeto image objects 3 cm below the surface of a 25 cm thick water phantom allows the liver to be distinguished from fat with a SNR superior to that of primary imaging when the objects are <=22 mm thick. Our analysis confirms the usefulness of scattered x rays, and provides simple methods for determining the regimes of medical interest in which x-ray scatter imaging could outperform conventional imaging.",Excluded

3506,"Molecular events associated with increased regenerative capacity of the goldfish retinal ganglion cells following X-irradiation: decreased level of axonal growth inhibitors In our previous work we established conditions to study the contribution of non-neuronal cells to the process of goldfish optic nerve regeneration. This issue has been studied successfully by adapting the use of X-irradiation to manipulate division of non-neuronal cells associated with the injured nerve. The regenerative capacity of the goldfish retinal ganglion cells was determined subsequent to the X-ray treatment. In this work we present an analysis of the molecular events associated with regeneration and enhanced regenerative capacity which follows X-irradiation. Under normal conditions the non-neuronal cells surrounding an intact nerve released axonal growth inhibitors, the level of which was only slightly sensitive to X-irradiation. In contrast, regenerating nerves showed a marked decrease in substances having an inhibitory effect on sprouting in vitro. Moreover, their level was significantly reduced following X-irradiation which was accompanied by increased accumulation of fibrous collagen adjacent to astrocytes. The alteration in the reciprocal relationship between the axon and the surrounding non-neuronal cells was also manifested by changes in the profile of labeled proteins released by the non-neuronal cells. The results of this work, therefore, indicate the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells to the environment provided by the cells surrounding the regenerating fibers and thus may open a new perspective relating to the capacity of neurons to regenerate.",Included
3126,"The probability distribution of side-chain conformations in [Leu] and [Met]enkephalin determines the potency and selectivity to mu and delta opiate receptors The structure of enkephalin, a small neuropeptide with five amino acids, has been simulated on computers using molecular dynamics. Such simulations exhibit a few stable conformations, which also have been identified experimentally. The simulations provide the possibility to perform cluster analysis in the space defined by potentially pharmacophoric measures such as dihedral angles, side-chain orientation, etc. By analyzing the statistics of the resulting clusters, the probability distribution of the side-chain conformations may be determined. These probabilities allow us to predict the selectivity of [Leu]enkephalin and [Met]enkephalin to the known mu- and delta-type opiate receptors to which they bind as agonists. Other plausible consequences of these probability distributions are discussed in relation to the way in which they may influence the dynamics of the synapse.",Excluded

2568,"Performance and brain electrical activity during prolonged confinement A subset of the AGARD-STRES battery including memory search, unstable tracking, and a combination of both tasks (dual-task), was applied repeatedly to the four chamber crew members before, during, and after the 60-day isolation period of EXEMSI. Five ground control group members served as a control group. A subjective state questionnaire was also included. The results were subjected to a quantitative single-subject analysis. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded to permit correlation of changes in task performance with changes in the physiological state. Evaluation of the EEG focused on spectral parameters of spontaneous EEG waves. No physiological data were collected from the control group. Significant decrements in tracking ability were observed in the chamber crew. The time course of these effects followed a triphasic pattern with initial deterioration, intermediate recovery to pre-isolation baseline scores after the first half of the isolation period, and a second deterioration towards the end. None of the control group subjects displayed such an effect. Memory search (speed and accuracy) was only occasionally impaired during isolation, but the control group displayed a similar pattern of changes. It is suggested that a state of decreased alertness causes tracking deterioration, which leads to a reduced efficiency of sustained cue utilization. The assumption of low alertness was further substantiated by higher fatigue ratings by the chamber crew compared to those of the control group. Analysis of the continuous EEG recordings revealed that only two subjects produced reliable alpha wave activity (8-12 Hz) over Pz and, to a much smaller extent, Fz-theta wave activity (5-7 Hz) during task performance. In both subjects Pz-alpha power decreased consistently under task conditions involving single-task and dual-task tracking. Fz-theta activity was increased more by single-task and dual-task memory search than by single-task tracking. The alpha attenuation appears to be associated with an increasing demand on perceptual cue utilization required by the tracking performance. In one subject marked attenuation of alpha power occurred during the first half of the confinement period, where he also scored the highest fatigue ratings. A striking increase in fronto-central theta activity was observed in the same subject after six weeks of isolation. The change was associated with an efficient rather than a degraded task performance, and a high rating of the item ""concentrated"" and a low rating of the item ""fatigued."" This finding supports the hypothesis that the activation state associated with increased fronto-central theta activity accompanies efficient performance of demanding mental tasks. The usefulness of standardized laboratory tasks as monitoring instruments is demonstrated by the direct comparability with results of studies obtained from other relevant research applications using the same tasks. The feasibility of a self-administered integrated psychophysiological assessment of the individual state was illustrated by the nearly complete collection of data. The large number of individual data collected over the entire period permitted application of quantitative single-subject analysis, allowing reliable determination of changes in the individual state in the course of time. It thus appears that this assessment technique can be adapted for in-flight monitoring of astronauts during prolonged spaceflights. Parallel EEG recording can provide relevant supplementary information for diagnosing the individual activation state associated with task performance. The existence of large individual differences in the generation of task-sensitive EEG rhythms forms an important issue for further studies.",Excluded
2619,"Stochastic growth pattern of untreated human glioblastomas predicts the survival time for patients Glioblastomas are highly malignant brain tumors. Knowledge of growth rates and growth patterns is useful for understanding tumor biology and planning treatment logistics. Based on untreated human glioblastoma data collected in Trondheim, Norway, we first fit the average growth to a Gompertz curve, then find a best fitted white noise term for the growth rate variance. Combining these two fits, we obtain a new type of Gompertz diffusion dynamics, which is a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Newly collected untreated human glioblastoma data in Seattle, US, re-verify our model. Instead of growth curves predicted by deterministic models, our SDE model predicts a band with a center curve as the tumor size average and its width as the tumor size variance over time. Given the glioblastoma size in a patient, our model can predict the patient survival time with a prescribed probability. The survival time is approximately a normal random variable with simple formulas for its mean and variance in terms of tumor sizes. Our model can be applied to studies of tumor treatments. As a demonstration, we numerically investigate different protocols of surgical resection using our model and provide possible theoretical strategies.",Excluded

Because ELF magnetic fields cause altered Ca(2+) homeostasis in neural tissues, we examined their influence on Ca(2+) signaling enzymes in hippocampus and related them with NMDA receptor functions. Hippocampal regions were obtained from brains of 21-day-old rats that were exposed for 90 days to 50Hz magnetic fields at 50 and 100 microT intensities. In comparison to controls, ELF exposure caused increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels concomitant with increased activities of Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase C (PKC), cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calcineurin as well as decreased activity of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in hippocampal regions. Simultaneous ligand-binding studies revealed decreased binding to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. The combined results suggest that perturbed neuronal functions caused by ELF exposure may involve altered Ca(2+) signaling events contributing to aberrant NMDA receptor activities.",Excluded
51,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of sarcoma metastasis Purpose/Objective(s): The role of conventional radiation in the management of sarcoma metastasis to the spine is limited due to its radioresistant nature. However, spinal stereotactic radiosurgery (sSRS) may have a radiobiological advantage given the high dose per fraction. The purpose of this study is to report our experience using sSRS to treat patients with sarcoma metastasis to the spine. Materials/Methods: Thirty-four lesions (17 patients) with sarcoma metastatic to the spine were identified from a large IRB-approved database. Pain relief post-sSRS was prospectively collected using the Brief Pain Inventory. Survival was calculated from date of procedure using Kaplan- Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine the association between clinical factors and pain relief. Result(s): Eligible patients had a median age of 55 years and 56% were female. Median KPS was 85 (range, 60-100) and median clinical follow-up was 7 months (range, 0-58). Location of metastasis included 44% cervical/ thoracic, 35% lumbar, and 21% sacral lesions. Approximately, 12% had cord compression, 32% had epidural compression, and 59% had neural foramen involvement at the time of treatment. Reason for treatment included 53% for pain, 21% for pain and neurological deficits, 1 patient had vertebral compression fracture and the remaining 24% were asymptomatic. Target volume was a median of 71 cc (range, 16-428 cc). Median maximum prescription dose was 16 Gy (range, 14-16 Gy). In terms of prior treatment, 21% of patients had received prior cEBRT, 15% had prior SBRT, 29% had prior surgery, and 21% had received prior hardware. At 6 and 12 months, actuarial survival was 81% and 73%, radiographic control was 66% and 50%, and unadjusted pain control was 65% and 65%, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated that both radiographic failure and pain relief were associated with age, with older patients less likely to have radiographic failure (HR = 0.864, p = 0.0004) and pain relief (HR = 0.929, p = 0.0202). Unadjusted symptom failure was associated with a larger target volume (HR = 1.010, p = 0.0142), prior surgery (HR = 7.353, p = 0.0131), and prior hardware (HR = 4.717, p = 0.0244). Conclusion(s): We report an unadjusted pain control in 65% of sarcoma patients with spinal metastasis. Based on our previously published data and due to the comparatively lower radiographic and pain control rates when compared to other histologies, we recommend increasing the dose beyond 16 Gy for sarcomas.",Excluded

In nonirradiated controls amyloidosis increased in prevalence with age after 12 months, and prevalence was higher in females than in males. Irradiation had the effect of advancing the appearance of amyloidosis to the 7-12 months group but did not intensify the amyloidotic process. IgG binding to the nucleus or cytoplasm of neurons was rare, and, despite the fact that IgM and IgA binding to these structures was present in about one-third of the animals, there was neither an aging nor an irradiation effect. The only statistically significant findings with respect to the concomitant occurrence of amyloid and NBA were negative correlations between nuclear IgM and IgA binding and amyloidosis.

Pain radiation may be forward or backward. We aimed to analyse a large series of patients attended in an outpatient headache clinic. Method(s): We systematically included all patients fulfilling criteria from March 2008 to January 2019. We prospectively assessed clinical and demographic characteristics, therapeutic requirements and response. Result(s): We included 87 patients (61 females, 26 males) out of 5980 attended during study period (1.45%). Age at onset was 45.3+/-16.8 years (16-84). 56 cases (64.4%) suffered a forward EF, 28 (32.2%) a backward EF, and in 3 (3.4%) paroxysms described both trajectories. Pain was strictly unilateral in 72 (82.7%) patients whilst in 11 (12.6%) shifted both sides and in 4 (4.6%) presented a sagittal trajectory. Pain quality was mainly described as electric (52, 59.7%), or stabbing (27. 31%) and intensity rated as 6.9+/-1.9 (3-10). In 28 cases (32%) autonomic features appeared (mainly lacrimation). Temporal pattern was heterogeneous, with spontaneous remissions in 27 cases (31%). 54 patients (62.1%) required a preventive therapy. The drugs that presented a better response were Gabapentin and Lamotrigin. 5 refractory cases were successfully managed with Lamotrigin.

Light activation in rod photoreceptors was established using a paired-flash electroretinogram (ERG) protocol, and the leading edge of the a-wave was modeled with the mechanisms mediating phototransduction. Deactivation of the photoreceptor response was evaluated at three luminous exposures (1.4-2.2 log cd.m/s-2) using a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) paradigm. Dark adaptation was evaluated at 90-second intervals for 30 minutes after approximately 20% pigment bleach. At each time point, a paired-flash signal (1.4 log cd.s/m-2) was used to extract rod responses.RESULTS: Diabetic animals showed decreased amplitudes of the photoreceptor response 12 weeks after diabetes induction. No difference was found in the rate of deactivation of the photoresponse in diabetic rats. Normalized amplitudes showed that diabetic animals had significantly faster dark adaptation (P<0.01) than did controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although photoreceptor activation was abnormal, deactivation was unaltered after 12 weeks of diabetes. The faster relative recovery found in diabetes after bleach, in the presence of normal pigment dynamics, may reflect a decrease in outer segment lengths.",Excluded

This combined regimen prolongs patient survival, but also carries a substantial risk for delayed neurotoxicity particularly in the elderly. However, cognitive outcome evaluations have not been included in most clinical trials.OBJECTIVE: To assess cognitive functioning and quality of life in PCNSL survivors treated either with WBRT +/- MTX-based chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone.METHODS: Twenty-eight PCNSL patients in disease remission received a post-treatment baseline neuropsychological evaluation, and a subset of patients were available for an 8-month follow-up evaluation. Assessment of quality of life and extent of white matter disease on MRI were also performed.RESULTS: Patients displayed mild to moderate impairments across several cognitive domains. These were of sufficient severity to reduce quality of life in half of the patient sample. Comparisons according to treatment type revealed more pronounced cognitive impairment, particularly in the memory and attention/executive domains, among patients treated with WBRT +/- chemotherapy. Extent of white matter disease correlated with attention/executive, memory, and language impairment.CONCLUSIONS: PCNSL survivors treated with WBRT +/- chemotherapy displayed more pronounced cognitive dysfunction than patients treated with MTX-based chemotherapy alone.",Excluded

After 10-min occlusion of both common carotid arteries, the gerbils were placed in the vicinity of an electromagnet and continuously exposed to ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) for 7 days. Their behaviour (locomotion, stereotypy, rotations, and immobility) was monitored on days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 after reperfusion for 60min in the open field. It was shown that the 10-min global cerebral ischemia per se induced a significant motor activity increase (locomotion, stereotypy and rotations), and consequently immobility decrease until day 4 after reperfusion, compared to control gerbils. Exposure to ELF-MF inhibited development of ischemia-induced motor hyperactivity during the whole period of registration, but significantly in the first 2 days after reperfusion, when the postischemic hyperactivity was most evident. Motor activity of these gerbils was still significantly increased compared to control ones, but only on day 1 after reperfusion. Our results revealed that the applied ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) decreased motor hyperactivity induced by the 10-min global cerebral ischemia, via modulation of the processes that underlie this behavioural response.",Excluded
2445,"Unmyelinated visceral afferents exhibit frequency dependent action potential broadening while myelinated visceral afferents do not Sensory information arising from visceral organ systems is encoded into action potential trains that propagate along afferent fibers to target nuclei in the central nervous system. These information streams range from tight patterns of action potentials that are well synchronized with the sensory transduction event to irregular, patternless discharge with no clear correlation to the sensory input. In general terms these afferent pathways can be divided into unmyelinated and myelinated fiber types. Our laboratory has a long standing interest in the functional differences between these two types of afferents in terms of the preprocessing of sensory information into action potential trains (synchrony, frequency, duration, etc.), the reflexogenic consequences of this sensory input to the central nervous system and the ionic channels that give rise to the electrophysiological properties of these unique cell types. The aim of this study was to determine whether there were any functional differences in the somatic action potential characteristics of unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents in response to different rates of sensory nerve stimulation. Our results showed that activity and frequency-dependent widening of the somatic action potential was quite prominent in unmyelinated but not myelinated vagal afferents. Spike broadening often leads to increased influx of Ca(2+) ions that has been associated with a diverse range of modulatory mechanisms both at the cell body and central synaptic terminations (e.g. increased neurotransmitter release.) We conclude that our observations are indicative of fundamentally different mechanisms for neural integration of sensory information arising from unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents.",Excluded

1356,"Structural plasticity of the adult central nervous system: Insights from the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. [French] Accumulating evidence renders the dogma obsolete according to which the structural organization of the brain would remain essentially stable in adulthood, changing only in response to a need for compensatory processes during increasing age and degeneration. It has indeed become clear from investigations on various models that the adult nervous system can adapt to physiological demands by altering reversibly its synaptic circuits. This potential for structural and functional modifications results not only from the plastic properties of neurons but also from the inherent capacity of the glial cellular components to undergo remodeling as well. This is currently known for astrocytes, the major glial cells in brain which are well-recognized as dynamic partners in the mechanisms of synaptic transmission, and for the tanycytes and pituicytes which contribute to the regulation of neurosecretory processes in neurohemal regions of the hypothalamus. Studies on the neuroendocrine hypothalamus, whose role is central in homeostatic regulations, have gained good insights into the spectacular neuronal-glial rearrangements that may subserve functional plasticity in the adult brain. Following pioneering works on the morphological reorganizations taking place in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system under certain physiological conditions such as dehydration and lactation, studies on the gonadotropic system that orchestrates reproductive functions have re-emphasized the dynamic interplay between neurons and glia in brain structural plasticity processes. This review summarizes the major contributions provided by these researches in the field and also addresses the question of the morphological rearrangements that occur on a 24-h basis in the central component of the circadian clock responsible for the temporal aspects of endocrine regulations. Taken together, the reviewed data highlight the close cooperation between neurons and glia in developing strategies for functional adaptation of the brain to the changing conditions of the internal and external environment.

888,"X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of two-component heterokaryons of Neurospora crassa. VIII. Dose-dependence of the overall spectrum There is considerable controversy in the literature concerning the nature of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in various experimental organisms. To investigate this problem in Neurospora crassa a series of experiments (Webber and de Serres, 1965) was performed to study the induction-kinetics of X-ray-induced mutation in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region of a two-component heterokaryon (H-12). Subsequent genetic analyses (de Serres, 1989a,b,c, 1990a), on a series of 832 mutants recovered in these experiments, have shown that 3 different classes of ad-3 mutants were recovered, namely gene/point mutations, multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations. Complementation studies with a series of genetic markers that define 21 genetic loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent genetic regions have shown that ad-3 mutants classified as multilocus deletions result from the inactivation of a series of loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions of Linkage Group I, whereas multiple-locus mutations result from combinations of gene/point mutations and multilocus deletions. Analysis of the induction kinetics of these 3 different classes, after completion of the genetic characterization of all mutants (de Serres, 1990b) demonstrated that gene/point mutations increase linearly with X-ray dose, whereas multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations increase as the square of X-ray dose. Further analysis of allelic complementation among the gene/point mutations at the ad-3B locus (de Serres, 1990c), demonstrated that the spectrum of complementation patterns was dose-dependent: complementing mutants with nonpolarized patterns decreased and noncomplementing mutations increased with increasing X-ray dose. There was little or no change with dose in the frequency of mutants with polarized patterns. In the present report, data from studies published previously have been utilized, along with additional data from the original X-ray experiments (12-5, 12-6, 12-7, and 12-10; see Webber and de Serres, 1965) to develop composite complementation maps of the X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions as a function of X-ray dose. This analysis of the overall spectrum of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region demonstrated marked dose-dependence and provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature with regard to specific-locus studies in different experimental organisms.",Excluded

The study assessed whether the radiation regimens and duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation differed between the 31 CVD patients and the 62 matched patients from the same cohort who had not died from CVD (control patients). Furthermore, the infarction/hemorrhage ratio, type of clinical stroke syndrome, and time to death after stroke were investigated in the CVD patients and in matched controls from the general population who had died from CVD (population controls). No significant differences in maximum or centrally absorbed dose, maximum or central biological equivalent dose, field size, or number of fraction were recorded between CVD and control patients. A significant difference in the duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation was recorded, but only in women (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the infarction/hemorrhage ratio (P > 0.3) of lacunar or posterior circulation syndrome compared with middle cerebral artery syndrome with cortical features (P = 0.22) or the proportion of patients who died within the first month after stroke onset (60% vs. 59%, respectively) between CVD patients and population controls. In conclusion, no significant effect on CVD deaths could be detected for any radiation parameter. A long history of unsubstituted pituitary insufficiency may be a contributing factor to the very high CVD mortality among women. There were no indications of significant differences in type of stroke, clinical stroke syndromes, or stroke fatality between the CVD patients and the population controls.",Excluded

In this study, we investigated the effects of IR on the differentiation of Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells and the involvement of tumor protein 53 (p53) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) during this process.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells were exposed to (137)Cs gamma-rays at 4, 8 or 16 Gy. After incubation for 72 h with or without inhibitors of p53, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and other kinases, the neuronal differentiation of irradiated Neuro-2a cells was examined through analyzing neurite outgrowth and neuronal maker expression and the activation of related signaling proteins by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Mouse primary neural stem cells (NSC) were exposed to IR at 1 Gy. The change of neuronal marker was examined using immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: The irradiation of Neuro-2a cells significantly increased the neurite outgrowth and the expression of neuronal markers (neuronal nuclei [NeuN], microtubule-associated protein 2 [Map2], growth associated protein-43 [GAP-43], and Ras-related protein 13 [Rab13]). Immunocytochemistry revealed that neuronal class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1) positive cells were increased and nestin positive cells were decreased by IR in Neuro-2a cells, which supported the IR-induced neuronal differentiation. However, the IR-induced neuronal differentiation was significantly attenuated when p53 was inhibited by pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) or p53-small interfering RNA (siRNA). The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, also suppressed the IR-induced neurite outgrowth, the activation of p53, the expression of GAP-43 and Rab13, and the increase of Tuj-1 positive cells. The increase of neurite outgrowth and Tuj-1 positive cells by IR and its suppression by LY294002 were also observed in mouse primary NSC.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IR is able to trigger the neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells and the activation of p53 via PI3K is an important step for the IR-induced differentiation of Neuro-2a cells.",Included
2385,"Human glycine alpha1 receptor inhibition by quercetin is abolished or inversed by alpha267 mutations in transmembrane domain 2 Quercetin, one of the flavonoids, is a compound of low molecular weight found in fruits and vegetables. Besides its antioxidative effect, quercetin also shows a wide range of diverse neuropharmacological actions. However, the cellular mechanisms of quercetin's actions, especially on ligand-gated ion channels and synaptic transmissions, are not well studied. We investigated the effect of quercetin on the human glycine alpha1 receptor channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Application of quercetin reversibly inhibited glycine-induced current (I(Gly)). Quercetin's inhibition depends on its dose, with an IC(50) of 21.5+/-.2 microM.

60,"The efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery in patients with trigeminal neuralgia: The initial experience of the Bezmialem Vakif University Background: Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery is, compared with surgical treatment, a less invasive treatment option for patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Aim(s): In this report, we analyzed the effect and safety of gamma knife radiosurgery performed in patients with TN. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for TN between June 2014 and January 2017. All patients were treated with Leksell Gamma Knife Model C (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) with a prescription dose of 40 Gy with a 50% isodose line. The follow-up of the patients was performed 1 week after the procedure and after every 3 months. The pain score of the patients was recorded using the visual analog scale (VAS). Complications were also reviewed. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software for Windows, version 23.0. Result(s): Twenty-four patients (10 males, 14 females) were included in the study. The median age of the patients was 62.5 years (range, 34-91 years). The pre-gamma knife median VAS was 10 (range, 5-10), and the median VAS was 1 (range, 0-10) during the last follow-up. The pain decreased in 16 (76%) patients. Two patients (9%) had treatment-related complications. One patient developed hypoesthesia along the dermatome of the maxillary branch of the fifth cranial nerve and another patient developed facial paresis, which recovered after the usage of steroids for 3 months. Conclusion(s): Gamma knife radiosurgery is an effective and safe treatment for patients with TN with an acceptable pain control rate.

651,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated.METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1.RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium.CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.",Included

To date, all MRI studies on RF heating of medical implants have been performed in horizontal closed-bore systems. Vertical MRI scanners have a fundamentally different distribution of electric and magnetic fields and are now available at 1.2T, capable of high-resolution structural and functional MRI. This work presents the first simulation study of RF heating of DBS implants in high-field vertical scanners. Method(s): We performed finite element electromagnetic simulations to calculate specific absorption rate (SAR) at tips of DBS leads during MRI in a commercially available 1.2T vertical coil compared to a 1.5T horizontal scanner. Both isolated leads and fully implanted systems were included. Result(s): We found 10- to 30-fold reduction in SAR implication at tips of isolated DBS leads, and up to 19-fold SAR reduction at tips of leads in fully implanted systems in vertical coils compared to horizontal birdcage coils. Conclusion(s): If confirmed in larger patient cohorts and verified experimentally, this result can open the door to plethora of structural and functional MRI applications to guide, interpret, and advance DBS therapy.

The ectodermic origin of melanocytes and the presence of melanin in the substantia nigra are the theoretic basis of the experimental use of this class of tracers for melanoma imaging.METHODS: Eleven patients with proven metastatic melanoma entered the study. Whole-body and planar scintigrams were performed 2, 4 and 24 hr after intravenous injection of a mean tracer activity of 205 MBq. The dosimetric evaluation was performed by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee method.RESULTS: The [123I]-(S)-IBZM scans allowed the detection of all six cutaneous lesions, five of six superficial pathologic lymph nodes, four of five pulmonary and one of two hepatic metastases. The maximum tumor-to-background ratio was 2.6 in planar images. The hepatobiliary excretion of the tracer may limit detection of intra-abdominal lesions. Dosimetry is similar to data for nononcologic patients.CONCLUSION: Although it is unclear if the mechanism of radiopharmaceutical uptake in melanoma is due to binding to membrane receptors or due to interactions with intracellular structures, radiolabeled benzamide is a promising tracer to detect melanoma.",Excluded

Follow-up was 2 years and included documentation of subjective discomforts (induration, deviation and painful erection).RESULTS: Induration (27.6%) and deviation (24.1%) of the erected penis are little improved, but in two-third of patients (65%) with painful erection defined relief could be obtained. It could also be shown that patients with short history of symptoms had best chances for a successful treatment. Side effects were not seen.CONCLUSION: In our experience radiotherapy is not suitable for all stages of IPP. Only patients in the early stages of IPP-especially the ones who suffer from painful erection-should be considered suitable for treatment with ionising radiation.",Excluded

Dose prescription was set to 16 x 3.63 Gy (total dose 58.08 Gy). The clinical target volume was the entire vocal cord. Setup verification was done by means of an online correction protocol using cone beam computed tomography. Data for voice quality assessment were collected prospectively at baseline, end of treatment, and 4, 6, and 12 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment using VHI questionnaires.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 7-50 months), the 2-year local control and overall survival rates were 100% and 90% because no single local recurrence was reported and 3 patients died because of comorbidity. All patients have completed the intended treatment schedule; no treatment interruptions and no grade 3 acute toxicity were reported. Grade 2 acute dermatitis or dysphagia was reported in only 5 patients (17%). No serious late toxicity was reported; only 1 patient developed temporary grade 2 laryngeal edema, and responded to a short-course of corticosteroid. The VHI improved significantly, from 33.5 at baseline to 9.5 and 10 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively (P<.001). The control group, treated to the whole larynx, had comparable local control rates (92.2% vs 100%, P=.24) but more acute toxicity (66% vs 17%, P<.0001) and higher VHI scores (23.8 and 16.7 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively, P<.0001).CONCLUSION: Single vocal cord irradiation is feasible and resulted in maximal local control rate at 2 years.

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of surgically treated PCMs larger than 2 cm.METHODS: A series of 199 consecutive patients (137 females, 68.8 %) with PCMs larger than 2 cm from between 1993 and 2003 were included. The clinical charts, radiographs, and follow-ups were evaluated.RESULTS: Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 111 (55.8 %) patients, subtotal resection (STR) in 65, and partial resection (PR) in 23. Cranial nerve dysfunctions were the most common complications and occurred in 133 (66.8 %) cases. The surgical mortality was 2.0 %. The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores significantly decreased 1 month after the operations (preoperative KPS = 76.8 and postoperative KPS = 64.8; p = 0.011, Paired-samples t test). Long-term follow-ups were obtained in 142 patients, the follow-up duration was 171.6 months, and the most recent KPS was 83.2. Permanent morbidities remained in 24 patients (18.9 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that brainstem edema and tumors larger than 4 cm in diameter were independent risk factors in terms of outcomes (KPS < 80). The recurrence/progression rates were 14.5, 31.8, and 53.3 % for the GTR, STR, and PR cases, respectively (p = 0.002, Pearson chi (2) test). Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the remnants exhibited good tumor control.CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes and low mortality were achieved with the microsurgical management of medium and large PCMs; however, the rates of cranial nerves dysfunction remained high. Radically aggressive resection might not be judicious in terms of postoperative morbidity. The preoperative evaluations and intraoperative findings were informative regarding the outcomes. The low follow-up rate likely compromised our findings, and additional consecutive studies were required.",Excluded

3585,"Cellular response of meningioma towards retinoid acid and ionizing radiation Meningiomas are the second most common primary brain tumors and represent one-third of all primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. Currently, most meninigiomas are effectively managed via surgical resection. Recurrent meningiomas and unresectable, residual tumors after partial resection are treated with radiation. However, patients who are not suitable for surgery or radiation therapy or whose tumors recur after such treatment have limited therapeutic options. Retinoids are a class of compounds structurally related to vitamin A. Retinoic acid (RA) has been widely used to treat dermatological disease. Recently, RA, the active derivative of vitamin A and the first candidate diffusible morphogen in vertebrates, was used as a potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agent. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of RA on meningiomas when administered in combinination with ionizing radiation. The early data showed that both all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 13-cis-retinoic aciecan inhibited cell proliferation at high concentrations (10 mM) but had little cell proliferation inhibition activity at low concentrations (10 nM and 1 mM, respectively), thereby implicating the role of RA in meningioma clinical treatment. Neither ATRA nor 13-cis-RA influenced cell cycle progression. Further study showed that 10-mM ATRA exposure led to increased cell death after irradiation; however, 10-nM or 1-mMATRA pretreatment enhanced meningioma cell survival following irradiation. Comet assay showed that RA reduced the G2/M phase arrest caused by irradiation, thereby suggesting that DNA repair processes are involved in the activity of RA when combined with radiation.",Excluded
792,"Lateral inhibition in the inner retina is important for spatial tuning of ganglion cells The center-surround receptive-field organization in retinal ganglion cells is widely believed to result mainly from lateral inhibition at the first synaptic level (in the outer retina). Inhibition at the second synaptic level (in the inner retina) is thought to mediate more complex response properties. Here we show that much of the sustained surround antagonism in certain on-center ganglion cells results from lateral inhibition in the inner retina, via GABAergic amacrine cells, and that the lateral conduction of this signal requires voltage-gated sodium currents. Blocking lateral inhibition in the inner retina eliminates the preference of small-center ganglion cells for small stimuli but has little effect on ganglion cells with large receptive-field centers. These results illustrate how lateral inhibition at successive synaptic stages can selectively control the size of neural receptive-field centers.",Excluded

717,"Pain flare following external beam radiotherapy and meaningful change in pain scores in the treatment of bone metastases BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To examine the incidence of pain flare following external beam radiotherapy and to determine what constitutes a meaningful change in pain scores in the treatment of bone metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases treated with external beam radiotherapy were asked to score their pain on a scale of 0-10 before the treatment (baseline), daily during the treatment and for 10 days after completion of external beam radiation. Pain flare was defined as a two-point increase from baseline pain in the pain scale of 0-10 with no decrease in analgesic intake or a 25% increase in analgesic intake employing daily oral morphine equivalent with no decrease in pain score. To distinguish pain flare from progression of pain, we required the pain score and analgesic intake to return back to baseline levels after the increase/flare. They were also asked to indicate if their pain changed during that time compared to pre-treatment level. The change in pain score was compared with patient perception.RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were evaluated in this study. There were 49 male and 39 female patients with the median age of 70 years. Twelve of 88 patients (14%) had pain flare on day 1. The overall incidence of pain flare during the study period ranged from 2 to 16%. A total of 797 pain scorings were obtained. Patients perceived an improvement in pain when their self-reported pain score decreased by at least two points.CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the occurrence of pain flare following the external beam radiotherapy in the treatment of bone metastases. Further studies are required to predict who are at risk for flare. Appropriate measures can be taken to alleviate the pain flare. The finding in the meaningful change in pain scores supports the investigator-defined partial response used in some clinical trials.",Excluded
3084,"Prostate cancer: Focal tumour ablation or total gland ablation? Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers affecting the male population worldwide. Men with newly diagnosed cancer have to decide between many available treatments. In particular, patients with low-risk PC (stage T1-T2, Nx-N0, M0) can now approach a focal therapy to avoid side effects of ""whole-gland treatment,"" such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or damage to surrounding structures. The key points for focal therapy depend on valid identification of target lesions within the prostate gland, long-term efficacy of treatment, and appropriate patient follow-up. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is now available as a focal therapeutic option for the management of low-risk PC; in the last 10 years, its feasibility and safety has been tested in a growing number of clinical studies. At present, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most accurate techniques used to investigate the male pelvis; recently, MR guidance was combined with the HIFU principle and was presented as a novel technique for focal ablation of PC. MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) represents a potential treatment of choice owing to its high anatomical resolution and the possibility of real-time monitoring of temperature during ablation. MRgFUS can also be used as a salvation therapy for locally proven recurrence of PC after radiation or brachytherapy failures.

996,"Low-grade gliomas in adults Adult patients with a magnetic resonance scan suggestive of a supratentorial low-grade glioma should generally undergo at least a stereotactic biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and rule out an anaplastic glioma or a non-neoplastic lesion. Early tumor treatment should be given to patients with newly diagnosed low-grade gliomas who are over age 50 years, those who have headaches or neurologic deficits other than seizures, or those whose neuroimaging studies show tumor growth or mass effect. For younger patients presenting with seizures and no other neurologic symptoms, it is reasonable to defer therapy until there is clinical or radiographic tumor progression. When it is judged that intervention is necessary, patients should undergo to maximal surgical tumor resection, which preserves or improves neurologic function. For younger (<50 years) astrocytoma patients with a good tumor resection, radiation may be deferred until tumor progression. Early radiation should be given to astrocytoma patients who are older than 50 years of age at diagnosis (regardless of the type of surgery) or to younger patients who are judged to require early intervention but who are not candidates for aggressive surgical resection. The radiation dose for low-grade glioma should be 4500 to 5000 cGy, preferably with three-dimensional conformal ports. The same guidelines for management apply to patients with low-grade oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma, except that chemotherapy is a reasonable alternative to radiation when it is judged that treatment other than surgical resection is required.

1416,"An exploration of the factor structure and development of potentially useful subscales of etiological beliefs about schizophrenia in a general population sample Background: Given that accessing care, treatment engagement, and course and outcomes among people with schizophrenia may be influenced by beliefs about causes in the larger community, causal beliefs about schizophrenia have been studied in numerous communities around the world. In particular, the 30-item list of etiological attributions developed by Angermeyer and colleagues has been used to describe causal beliefs in patients, family members, and lay community members within such communities. The current study, the first examination of the latent or factorial structure of these 30 causal beliefs, seeks to provide informative subscales that may enhance reliability and validity of groupings of causes for future analyses involving community members. Method(s): Data were gathered from six separate surveys involving three distinct groups of individuals from the same community within the southeastern United States: lay community members, relatives of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and police officers at the start of a 1-week mental health training program. Result(s): Exploratory factor analysis in the overall sample (n = 577) revealed four factors that were used to define four subscales, termed: personal/family/social stressors (14 items), inconsistent with modern conceptions of risk (8 items), external/environmental insults to the brain (6 items), and consistent with modern biological conceptions (2 items). Cronbach's internal consistency reliability coefficients for these subscales were 0.91, 0.83, 0.71, and 0.65, respectively. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that subscales could be derived to provide continuous measures for assessing causal beliefs in order to study how this concept relates to attitudes toward schizophrenia, the people affected by the disorder, and treatments that are recommended by mental health professionals.

Results of recent studies studying the oxidative related values in larynx cancer indicated the importance of oxidative stress. Main reactive oxygen species (ROS) are superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. Production normal level of ROS is a physiological process, because the ROS has been using for physiological functions such as killing bacteria and viruses in the body. The excessive production of ROS is scavenged by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. 900 and 1800 MHz frequencies are used in cell phones in several countries including Turkey, although 2450 MHz has been using as Wi-Fi frequency in the countries.

255,"The effects of a spaceflight analog with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on sensorimotor adaptation Aboard the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts must adapt to altered vestibular and somatosensory inputs due to microgravity. Sensorimotor adaptation on Earth is often studied with a task that introduces visuomotor conflict. Retention of the adaptation process, known as savings, can be measured when subjects are exposed to the same adaptive task multiple times. It is unclear how adaptation demands found on the ISS might interfere with the ability to adapt to other sensory conflict at the same time. In the present study, we investigated the impact of 30 days' head-down tilt bed rest combined with elevated carbon dioxide (HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>) as a spaceflight analog on sensorimotor adaptation. Eleven subjects used a joystick to move a cursor to targets presented on a computer screen under veridical cursor feedback and 45degree rotated feedback. During this NASA campaign, five individuals presented with optic disk edema, a sign of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). Thus, we also performed post hoc exploratory analyses between subgroups who did and did not show signs of SANS. HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> had some impact on sensorimotor adaptation, with a lack of savings across the whole group. SANS individuals showed larger, more persistent after-effects, suggesting a shift from relying on cognitive to more implicit processing of adaptive behaviors. Overall, these findings suggest that HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> alters the way in which individuals engage in sensorimotor processing.

We reanalysed data to examine the effect of using change in ranked scales of neurological status (MRC Neurological Status Scale) and performance (World Health Organisation Scale: WHO) to determine progression rather than clinician's impression. Four hundred and seventy four patients were studied. Where clinicians recorded no progression, ranked scales frequently documented progression (MRC 13%; WHO 13%). Where clinicians recorded progression, ranked scales frequently did not alter (MRC 33%; WHO 30%) or occasionally improved (MRC 5%; WHO 3%). When analysing time to progression based on a variety of measures, the estimated difference between treatments was most extreme (hazard ratio 0.81, logrank p = 0.04) when change in WHO status was used, and least extreme when change in MRC neurological status was used (hazard ratio 0.99, p = 0.94). This study highlights how different outcome measures can significantly alter the interpretation of randomised studies.",Excluded
201,"Enucleation versus preservation of blind eyes following plaque radiotherapy for choroidal melanoma BACKGROUND: Currently available information about patients with posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy is insufficient to determine what to do about eyes that become blind as a consequence of the tumour and its treatment. Should they be enucleated, or is ocular preservation just as good in terms of survival?METHODS: We performed a retrospective survival analysis of secondary enucleation versus ocular preservation in patients with a posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy whose irradiated eye became completely blind following that treatment. Of the 79 patients who fulfilled defined inclusion criteria, 25 underwent secondary enucleation of the blind eye, and 54 retained their irradiated blind eye.RESULTS: Most of the baseline demographic and tumour-related variables evaluated were similarly distributed between the subgroups. The 5-year, 10-year and 15-year all-cause death rates in the secondary enucleation subgroup were 24.7%, 51.5% and 52.0% respectively, and those in the ocular preservation subgroup were 7.4%, 32.9% and 48.1% respectively. In spite of the apparent slight difference between the curves, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.41, Mantel-Haenszel test).INTERPRETATION: Although a retrospective study of this type has several limitations, our results suggest that secondary enucleation is not likely to substantially improve survival of patients whose irradiated eye becomes totally blind following plaque radiotherapy for choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanoma.",Excluded

1686,"Pharmacokinetics of the potent hallucinogen, salvinorin A in primates parallels the rapid onset and short duration of effects in humans Salvia divinorum, a mint plant originally used by the Mazatecs of Oaxaca, Mexico in spiritual rituals has gained popularity, in smoked form, as a legal hallucinogen in the United States and Europe. Abuse results in rapid onset and short-lasting effects that include visual hallucinations and motor-function impairment. Salvinorin A, the psychoactive component of S. divinorum, is a uniquely potent agonist at kappa-opioid receptors, targets for new therapeutic drugs. We labeled salvinorin A with C-11 by acylation of salvinorin B with [11C]-acetyl chloride to study whether its kinetic behavior in the brain parallels its uniquely fast, yet brief physiological effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies performed in 6 adult female baboons indicated extremely rapid brain uptake reaching a peak accounting for 3.3% of the total administered dose in 40 s and clearing with a half-life of 8 min. [11C]-salvinorin A was distributed throughout the brain with the highest concentration in the cerebellum and a notable concentration in the visual cortex, perhaps accounting for its physiological effects when smoked. Naloxone administration did not reduce the overall concentration of [11C]-salvinorin A significantly nor did it change its regional distribution. Peripheral organ kinetics suggested at least two modes of metabolism and excretion occur: through the renal and biliary systems. Our findings have revealed that the exceptionally rapid uptake and brief duration of salvinorin A in the brain match the time-course of visual hallucinations for S. divinorum when smoked. The effects of salvinorin A may occur at <10 mug in the human brain, emphasizing its remarkable potency.",Excluded
261,"Distinct response of adult neural stem cells to low versus high dose ionising radiation Radiosusceptibility is the sensitivity of a biological organism to ionising radiation (IR)-induced carcinogenesis, an outcome of IR exposure relevant following low doses. The tissue response is strongly influenced by the DNA damage response (DDR) activated in stem and progenitor cells. We previously reported that in vivo exposure to 2 Gy X-rays activates apoptosis, proliferation arrest and premature differentiation in neural progenitor cells (transit amplifying cells and neuroblasts) but not in neural stem cells (NSCs) of the largest neurogenic region of the adult brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ). These responses promote adult quiescent NSC (qNSC) activation after 2 Gy. In contrast, neonatal (P5) SVZ neural progenitors continue proliferating and do not activate qNSCs. Significantly, the human and mouse neonatal brain is radiosusceptible. Here, we examine the response of stem and progenitor cells in the SVZ to low IR doses (50-500 mGy). We observe a linear dose-response for apoptosis but, in contrast, proliferation arrest and neuroblast differentiation require a threshold dose of 200 or 500 mGy, respectively. Importantly, qNSCs were not activated at doses below 500 mGy. Thus, full DDR activation in the neural stem cell compartment in vivo necessitates a threshold dose, which can be considered of significance when evaluating IR-induced cancer risk and dose extrapolation.",Included
3042,"Effects of external beam radiation in the rat tibial nerve after crush, transection and repair, or nerve isograft paradigms INTRODUCTION: In head and neck surgery, radiation therapy is often administered to an injured nerve. Previous studies have examined the effects of either preoperative or postoperative radiation on nerve regeneration in rodents. In these studies, histomorphometric analysis was performed up to 8 month postoperatively. Given the exceptional neuroregenerative capacity of rodents, significant differences in nerve regeneration may go undetected if nerves are evaluated at such distant postoperative time points. This study is designed with a more appropriate model and investigates the effects of radiation after three common nerve injury paradigms.METHODS: Sixty-four Lewis rates were randomized to 8 groups corresponding to uninjured, tibial nerve crush, transection and repair, or reconstruction with isografts. Half of the animals in each of these paradigms (n = 8 per group) were treated with 10 Gy of external beam radiation to the site of nerve injury at 7 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 28, functional recovery and histomorphometric assessment was performed.RESULTS: For a given paradigm of nerve injury, no significant differences in nerve fiber number, neural density, neural debris, or fiber width were noted between the control and radiated groups, and radiation did not affect functional recovery.CONCLUSION: Radiation had no discernible effect on nerve regeneration or functional recovery in the rodent nerve injury models studied. All assessments were made at time points suitable for detecting differences in nerve regeneration between groups. These findings suggest that administration of radiation to fields containing injured peripheral nerve is unlikely to adversely affect functional outcomes.",Included
1728,"Protection of normal brain cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis by a mitochondria-targeted triphenyl-phosphonium-nitroxide: a possible utility in glioblastoma therapy Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor. A strong rationale to identify innovative approaches to treat these tumors is required since treatment failures result in local recurrences and median survivals range from 9 to 12 months. Glioma cells are reported to have less mitochondrial content compared to adjacent normal brain cells. Based on this difference, we suggest a new strategy, utilizing protection of normal brain cells by mitochondria-targeted electron scavengers and antioxidants-nitroxides-thus allowing for the escalation of the radiation doses. In this paper, we report that a conjugate of nitroxide with a hydrophobic cation, triphenyl-phosphonium (TPEY-Tempo), significantly protected brain endothelial cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis while radiosensitizing brain tumor cells. Thus, TPEY-Tempo may be a promising adjunct in the treatment of glioblastoma with the potential to not only prolong survival but also to maintain quality of life and reduce treatment toxicity.",Included

Thirteen migraine patients and 12 sex- and age-matched controls were evaluated. Each rTMS session consisted of 1,800 stimuli at a frequency of 5 Hz and 90% motor threshold intensity. Sham (control) rTMS was performed at the same stimulation position. The vertex LEP amplitude was reduced at the trigeminal and hand levels in the sham-placebo condition and after rTMS to a greater extent in the migraine patients than in healthy controls, while the laser pain rating was unaffected. These results suggest that HF rTMS of motor cortex and the sham procedure can both modulate pain-related evoked responses in migraine patients.",Excluded

9,"Functional analysis of the hippocampus using optofMRI In recent years the technique of optogenetics has been thoroughly developed. By inducing the expression of ChR2 (light-gated cation channel) in the neuronal cells of the rat brain, we can operate the activity of neurons by using light.

In a recent paper, optogenetics and fMRI were combined. This technique was called opto-fMRI (ofMRI) and enabled us to observe the entire brain noninvasively. Our study focused on hippocampus, due to its role in neurogenesis and memory formation. We investigated how the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus responds when it is stimulated by light. FMRI data was analyzed statistically using spm5 software. As a result, when the DG was stimulated by light, we observed significant BOLD change of the CA1 and CA3 regions.

72,"Activation of long-term synaptic plasticity causes suppression of epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices Electrical stimulation of cerebral targets for the treatment of epilepsy is an area under active investigation. Recent studies have shown that chronic stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, fornix, or hippocampus may be effective in attenuating seizure frequency in animal models and in patients with intractable epilepsy. However, many questions exist, such as what are the specific electrical parameters, target sites, and mechanisms, etc., which should be investigated in animal studies before considering the routine use of chronic stimulation in epileptic patients. It is also important to understand what happens to neural activity during repetitive pulse stimulation as well as after stimulation. To this end, we hypothesized: (1) activation of synaptic plasticity suppresses epileptiform activity and (2) low frequency stimulation is an effective stimulation protocol for reducing seizure intensity and frequency. We used rat hippocampal brain slices to study how electrical stimulation affects spontaneous and evoked epileptiform activity. Further, we compared low (1 Hz) versus high (100 Hz) frequency stimulation in the same preparation. We found that orthodromic stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals for 10 min reduces the amplitude of normal responses and diminishes epileptiform activity. The onset of suppression by 1 Hz stimulation was gradual, but persistent, whereas the onset of suppression by 100 Hz was rapid; however, the effects of 100 Hz stimulation were transient. Finally, the NMDA antagonist, AP5 reversed the antiepileptic effects achieved by 1 Hz stimulation. Collectively, these data suggest that using different stimulation parameters prolonged electrical stimulation in the hippocampus may be effective in reducing seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy and that suppression by low frequency stimulation may be mediated by long-term depression (LTD).",Excluded

1290,"Pre-clinical implementation of a small animal image-guided irradiator Purpose/Objective: Poor precision and large field sizes used in conventional pre-clinical experiments are stumbling blocks for a fair comparison to clinical practice, where advanced RT techniques are commonly used. In addition the open problems in radiation oncology and radiobiology and the large number of possible interactions of targeted drugs in specific treatments cannot rely on clinical trials alone and emphasize the need of pre-clinical radiation research. In recent years several solutions have been proposed and here we present the implementation of a small animal IGRT (muIGRT) system (XRAD 225Cx, Precision X-Ray Inc., USA). Material(s) and Method(s): The system is designed to be able to reproduce the clinical IGRT practice and equipped with a kV x-rays source (20-225 kVp), a computer controlled couch and a high resolution a-Si detector (XRD 0820 AN, Perkin Elmer, USA) with a CsI scintillator, 200 mum pixel pitch and 1024x1024 pixels. It is designed to image (CBCT) the subject, target the area to be irradiated, position this area in the irradiation center and treat with field size down to 1 mm from different angles. This gives the possibility to perform fractionated therapy, study partial volume and dose effects and normal tissue toxicity. Result(s): Dosimetric and geometric commissioning has shown the calibrated system delivers doses (with reproducibility sigma=0.14, 0.14, 0.06 mm for LR, SI and AP respectively) in small fields (2.5 Gy/min for 5 mm field size) with 0.1 mm in-vivo targeting accuracy. The efficacy of fractionated muIGRT (4x5 Gy, 5 mm field) has been shown on various stereotactic intracranial tumour bearing mouse models (xenograft and spontaneous) where muIGRT allows local delivery of dose higher than previously used. Here the inter- and intrafraction movement has been assessed, by using image registration, to be 1.2 mm and below 0.1 mm RMS, respectively (under isoflurane anaesthesia). The additional use of multi-modality image registration (MRI to CBCT) helps improving the tumour localization of 0.3 mm (the tumour injection bore-hole used as landmark in CBCT already decreases the localization uncertainty). Normal tissue toxicity studies have been carried on for partial volume irradiation of the heart. gammaH2Ax staining of heart tissue radiation damage proved that it is feasible to accurately irradiate either the apex or the base of the heart by using image-guidance and a field size of 2.5 mm. It has been shown that left lung irradiation can be minimized while the right lung can be spared. (Figure presented). Conclusion(s): In conclusion we showed the calibrated system is capable of delivering reproducible treatments in pre-clinically convenient delivery time. We reported the implementation of a preclinical muIGRT system and showed feasible pre-clinical fractionated therapy (~5 minute per subject) in stereotactic intracranial muRT.

We based the exposure assessment on measurements from 1,015 different workplaces. On the basis of the job held longest during the 10-year period before diagnosis, we found an association between the average, daily, mean level of EMF and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The risk increased with increasing level of exposure. The odds ratios (OR) and the 95 percent confidence interval (CI) for three consecutive levels of exposure were: 1.1 (CI = 0.5-2.3); 2.2 (CI = 1.1-4.3); 3.0 (CI = 1.6-5.8), respectively. No association was observed for acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 1.0, CI = 0.5-1.8; OR = 0.8, CI = 0.4-1.6; OR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.9). For brain tumors, the corresponding risk estimates were 1.0 (CI = 0.7-1.6); 1.5 (CI = 1.0-2.2); 1.4 (CI = 0.9-2.1). Different EMF indices were tested. Tasks with frequent or large variations between high and low field-densities (high standard deviation) were more common among CLL subjects. For brain tumors, a prolonged high level (high median values) showed the strongest association. Confounding by place of residence, smoking, benzene, ionizing radiation, pesticides, and solvents was evaluated, and these factors did not seem to have a decisive influence on the associations. We also analyzed other potential sources of bias. For CLL, there were indications of an excess number of low-exposure subjects among non-responders, which, to some extent, may have enhanced but not caused the risk estimates obtained. Our conclusion is that the study supports the hypothesis that occupational EMF exposure is a hazard in the development of certain cancers.",Excluded

1524,"[Radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy of vestibular schwannoma] Management of vestibular schwannoma (VS) should always be interdisciplinary and results better than the natural course. Particularly in small VS, either microsurgical resection or radiosurgery (RS) can be employed. RS is a special method (initially only possible stereotactically) for delivering high-precision radiation from many directions to the target point (the isocenter) in a single high dose. With the development of three different systems-Gamma Knife (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden), special linear accelerators, and CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)-the options were extended to 1-5 fractions for RS and multisession RS (msRS), and to up to 6 weeks of conventional fractionation as stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Whereas RS uses high ablative single doses, SRT is based on the well-known radiobiological effects of multiple fractions comprising lower single doses up to a required much higher total dose. Evaluation showed that RS and SRT achieve similarly high rates of tumor control of around 90% and low rates of side effects (1-7%). Therefore, SRT is unnecessary for small but clearly progressing VS, which has made RS a very comfortable, effective treatment option. In addition to SRT, larger VS can be treated comparably effectively with CyberKnife-based msRS. Since modern MRI frequently discovers small VS as ""incidental findings"", the initial biding strategy (wait and scan) is of particular importance. Only with increasing symptoms and detectable tumor growth is the treatment indication established, at which time the decision for surgery and RS/SRT should be taken interdisciplinary under consideration of the patient's wishes.",Excluded

Method(s): Gafchromic films and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used to determine the Maximum Skin Dose (MSD). Correlation of the online dose indicators (fluoroscopy time, kerma- or dose-area product (KAP or DAP) and cumulative air kerma at interventional reference point (K<inf>a,r</inf>)) with MSD was evaluated and used to establish the alert levels corresponding to a MSD of 2 Gy and 5 Gy. The uncertainties of alert levels in terms of DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf>, and uncertainty of MSD were calculated. Result(s): About 20-30% of all MSD values exceeded 2 Gy while only 2-6% exceeded 5 Gy. The correlations suggest that both DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf> can be used as a dose indicator for alert levels (Pearson correlation coefficient p mostly >0.8), while fluoroscopy time is not suitable (p mostly <0.6). Generic alert levels based on DAP (Gy cm<sup>2</sup>) were suggested for MSD of both 2 Gy and 5 Gy (for 5 Gy: TACE 750, PCI 250 and NE 400). The suggested levels are close to the lowest values published in several other studies. The uncertainty of the MSD was estimated to be around 10-15% and of hospital-specific skin dose alert levels about 20-30% (with coverage factor k = 1). Conclusion(s): The generic alert levels are feasible for some cases but should be used with caution, only as the first approximation, while hospital-specific alert levels are preferred as the final approach.

2580,"A clonogenic survival assay of neural stem cells in rat spinal cord after exposure to ionizing radiation Neural stem cells play an important role in neurogenesis of the adult central nervous system (CNS). Inhibition of neurogenesis has been suggested to be an underlying mechanism of radiation-induced CNS damage. Here we developed an in vivo/ in vitro clonogenic assay to characterize the survival of neural stem cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Cells were isolated from the rat cervical spinal cord and plated as single cell suspensions in defined medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The survival of the proliferating cells was determined by their ability to form neurosphere colonies. The number and size of neurospheres were analyzed quantitatively at day 10, 12, 14 and 16 after plating. Plating cells from 5, 10 and 15 mm of the cervical spinal cord resulted in a linear increase in the number of neurospheres from day 10-16. Compared to the nonirradiated spinal cord, there was a significant decrease in the number and size of neurosphere colonies cultured from a 10-mm length of the rat spinal cord after a single dose of 5 Gy. When dissociated neurospheres derived from a spinal cord that had been irradiated with 5 Gy were allowed to differentiate, the percentages of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as determined by immunocytohistochemistry were not altered compared to those from the nonirradiated spinal cord. Secondary neurospheres could be obtained from cells dissociated from primary neurospheres that had been cultured from the irradiated spinal cord. In conclusion, exposure to ionizing radiation reduces the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells cultured from the rat spinal cord. However, neural stem cells retain their pluripotent and self-renewing properties after irradiation. A neurosphere-based assay may provide a quantitative measure of the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells in the adult CNS after irradiation.",Included
339,"Advanced radiation therapy plan for glm based on FMRI Purpose: Following radical radiotherapy (RT), high graDe gliomas such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) frequently recur within the high dose volume and it is plausible that conventional planning margins might be reduced without a loss of local tumour control. Akin to the current evaluation of reduction in the dose delivered to the hippocampal and limbic systems to reduce radiationrelated memory impairment, other uninvolved critical functional cerebral areas should be spared to minimise the potential acute and late toxicities of radiation therapy. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of speech centre localisation using functional MRI (fMRI) on the RT planning process in GBM. Materials: Language function was activated in a 68-year old male with a right fronto-parietal GBM using a 'word generation' task. Block designed blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI was applied (1.5 T Siemens Avanto scanner) during lingual stimulation [1]. BOLD-clusters were assessed individually for anatomical localization. fMRI was performed using EPI sequence and T1-weighted anatomical 3D VIBE sequence was used for functional image analysis and overlay [1]. The functional image analysis and overlay procedures were performed using BrainVoyager (BrainInnovationBV, Maastricht, The Netherlands). A CT scan (Siemens Open Sensation) was performed to delineate the radiation target volume and organs at risk (OAR) (Fig 1A). The fusion of the 3-D anatomical and functional datasets (CT+fMRI) as well as the segmentation of the radiation target volume was achieved using Siemens Oncology workstation (Fig. 1B). The speech centres were defined as OARs in the IMRT planning process (mean 45 Gy, max. 50 Gy) (Fig. 1C). The treatment plan (Pinnacle 8.0m TPS, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) was not used clinically and the patient was informed. Result(s): Speech activation areas and the GBM (as defined on the T1 MRI images) could be visualised separately. The plan did not compromise any other constraint and spared the critical structures. The mean and maximum doses to the PTV (60 Gy prescribed to 100%) were 61.97 Gy and 69.47 Gy respectively. Broca's area was partially within the PTV, however the mean and maximum doses to Wernicke's area were 36 Gy and 52.81 Gy (Fig. 1C). Figure 1.

Here we describe a method-influence mapping-that uses single-neuron perturbations to directly measure how cortical neurons reshape sensory representations. In layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1), we use two-photon optogenetics to trigger action potentials in a targeted neuron and calcium imaging to measure the effect on spiking in neighbouring neurons in awake mice viewing visual stimuli. Excitatory neurons on average suppressed other neurons and had a centre-surround influence profile over anatomical space. A neuron's influence on its neighbour depended on their similarity in activity. Notably, neurons suppressed activity in similarly tuned neurons more than in dissimilarly tuned neurons. In addition, photostimulation reduced the population response, specifically to the targeted neuron's preferred stimulus, by around 2%. Therefore, V1 layer 2/3 performed feature competition, in which a like-suppresses-like motif reduces redundancy in population activity and may assist with inference of the features that underlie sensory input. We anticipate that influence mapping can be extended to investigate computations in other neural populations.",Excluded

One extra animal was included at the 130- and 30-CGE doses. Animals were imaged using a standard 1.5-tesla GE Signa MRI. A 3-inch surface coil was employed to obtain T1-weighted sagittal images (TR 600 and TE 30) and dual echo T2-weighted coronal images (TR 3,000 and TE 30/90). Animals were imaged at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6 and 9 months. Volumetric analysis with custom software was done to evaluate areas of increased signal on T2-weighted images, and signal change versus time curves were generated. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was also done at the 9-month time point to further evaluate tissue injury. The development of hydrocephalus was also examined.RESULTS: Peak tissue injury was greater and occurred earlier with higher versus lower doses of radiation. Statistically significant differences were seen between the 130- and 90-CGE animals and between the 90- and 60-CGE animals (p < 0.0016) using ANOVA. Signal changes can be seen in at least 1 of the animals at 20 CGE. The largest volume of tissue enhancement at 9 months was seen in animals at 60 CGE, which may represent an intermediate zone of tissue injury and gliosis compared with greater tissue loss at higher doses and less injury at lower doses. Hydrocephalus developed first in the untreated hemisphere in 130- and 90-CGE animals as a result of mass effect while it occurred at a later time in the treated hemisphere in lower-dose animals.CONCLUSIONS: Following single-dose proton radiosurgery of rat hippocampus, serial MRIs show T2 signal changes in animals ranging from 130 down to 20 CGE as well as the development of hydrocephalus. Dose-effect relationships using proton radiosurgery in rats will be a helpful step in guiding further studies on radiation injury to brain tissue.",Included
3249,"Preservation of visual fields after peri-sellar gamma-knife radiosurgery Radiosurgical treatment of pituitary and peri-sellar tumors has become an increasingly utilized modality as an alternative to conventional radiotherapy and surgery. Such radiosurgery results in a relatively high dose of radiation to the optic chiasm. The clinical data establishing safe single-fraction doses to the chiasm is immature, although taken together previous literature suggests a recommended maximal dose of 8 Gy. Optic neuropathy, when it occurs, tends to take place within 2 years of treatment. We evaluated the visual fields of 20 sequential patients that received significant doses to the optic chiasm by Gamma-knife radiosurgery. There were 17 cases of pituitary adenoma and 3 cases of meningioma, and two patients refused follow-up testing. Preoperative visual field and cranial nerve examinations were done prior to radiosurgery and in follow-up, with a median follow-up of 24 months. There were no cases of quantitative visual field deficit induced by treatment. No patients developed symptomatic visual deterioration. Radiat. Oncol.

Results demonstrated that following 60 stimulations of the left basolateral amygdala over a 4-week period, male Long-Evans rats exhibited decrements in every aspect of sexual behavior. Specifically, latencies to mount, intromit and ejaculate were all prolonged following long-term kindling, and ejaculation frequencies were significantly reduced. Furthermore, spontaneous peri-copulatory WDS were increased in kindled rats, suggesting a possible role of the 5-HT2A receptor. However, countering this suggestion, there were no differences between sham and kindled rats on WDS induced by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI. These results suggest that kindled rats may exhibit elevated levels of endogenous serotonin during exposure to a female rat, which would attenuate copulatory behavior, while concurrently increasing WDS expression.",Excluded

For intracerebral N29 tumors, single-fraction radiation therapy with 5 or 15 Gy had no significant effect on the survival time. Immunization with IFN-gamma-transfected N29 cells significantly increased the survival time by 61%. Single-fraction radiation therapy with 5 Gy combined with immunization increased the survival time significantly by 87% and complete remissions by 75% while with 15 Gy the survival time increased 45% with 38% complete remissions. For intracerebral N32 tumors, single-fraction radiation therapy with 15 Gy increased the survival time significantly by 20%. Immunization by itself had no significant effect with IFN-gamma-transfected N32 cells, but combined with 15 Gy single-fraction radiation therapy it increased survival time significantly by 40%, although there were no complete remissions. Based on these findings, we suggest a new therapeutic regimen for malignant glioma using single-fraction radiation therapy with a target absorbed dose of the order of 5-10 Gy combined with clinically verified immunotherapy.",Excluded

These are breast irradiation of breast conserving therapy,post mastectomy regional irradiation,irradiation for regional lymph nodes recurrence,breast irradiation of inoperable locally advanced cases,palliative irradiation of brain metastasis,bone metastasis and so on. The relationship among radiotherapy,surgery and systemic therapy has to be considered in those situations.In breast conserving therapy, the usefulness of breast irradiation is well established. Otherwise, a local controllability depend on a grade of residual tumor cell has not been understand. The authors conducted the survey of 941 cases of positive surgical margins and found that doses more than 60 Gy has a tendency for better local control in post menopausal cases. To reduce patient's burden,3 weeks short course irradiation (Canadian protocol) or accelerated partial breast irradiation have been introduced in breast irradiation. A subgroup which has no need to irradiate to conserving breast had not been identified. The timing between postoperative chemotherapy and irradiation is another point that has to be considered. To reduce distant metastasis,chemotherapy first has been considered better. As for post mastectomy regional irradiation, improvement of local and systemic control has been widely known these days. A timing of systemic therapy and irradiation is a point has to consider. In inoperable or far advanced T 4 tumors, breast irradiation with concurrent chemotherapy must be considered in stead of surgery. We have to know a big shortage in Japanese cancer treatment situation that we have few radiation oncologists or medical physicists in Japan. We have to educate those specialists to catch up with increasing cancer patients.",Excluded
2226,"Modeling depression: social dominance-submission gene expression patterns in rat neocortex Gene expression profiles in the cortex of adult Long-Evans rats as a function of a stressful social loss and victory in inter-male fighting encounters were examined. This social dominance and subordination model has been postulated to simulate early changes in the onset of depression in the losers. Microarrays were fabricated containing 45mer oligonucleotides spotted in quadruplicate and representing 1178 brain-associated genes. Dynamic range, discrimination power, accuracy and reproducibility were determined with standard mRNA ""spiking"" studies. Gene expression profiles in dominant and subordinate animals were compared using a ""universal"" reference design [Churchill GA (2002) Fundamentals of experimental design for cDNA microarrays. Nat Genet 32 (Suppl):490-495]. Data were analyzed by significance analysis of microarrays using rank scores [Tusher VG, Tibshirani R, Chu G (2001) Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:5116-5121; van de Wiel MA (2004) Significance analysis of microarrays using rank scores. Kwantitatieve Methoden 71:25-37]. Ontological analyses were then performed using the GOMiner algorithm [Zeeberg BR, Feng W, Wang G, Wang MD, Fojo AT, Sunshine M, Narasimhan S, Kane DW, Reinhold WC, Lababidi S, Bussey KJ, Riss J, Barrett JC, Weinstein JN (2003) GoMiner: a resource for biological interpretation of genomic and proteomic data. Genome Biol 4(4):R28]. And finally, genes of special interest were further studied using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-two transcripts were statistically significantly differentially expressed in the neocortex between dominant and subordinate animals. Ontological analyses revealed that significant gene changes were clustered primarily into functional neurochemical pathways associated with protein biosynthesis and cytoskeletal dynamics. The most robust of these were the increased expression of interleukin-18, heat shock protein 27, beta3-tubulin, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 in subordinate animals. Interleukin-18 has been found to be over-expressed in human depression and panic disorder as well as other physiological stress paradigms [Takeuchi M, Okura T, Mori T, Akita K, Ohta T, Ikeda M, Ikegami H, Kurimoto M (1999) Intracellular production of interleukin-18 in human epithelial-like cell lines is enhanced by hyperosmotic stress in vitro.

3129,"Late-Onset Intractable Cerebrospinal Fluid Leakage After Stereotactic Radiotherapy After Resection of Giant Nonfunctioning Pituitary Adenoma Background: Late-onset skull base cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage after stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a very rare complication. Case Description: A 54-year-old woman came to our department for convulsions and was admitted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a giant tumor in the skull base region, including the sphenoid sinus, pituitary fossa, right cavernous sinus, right middle fossa, and right basal ganglia. Mild left hemiparesis was noted. An ophthalmologic examination revealed left side homonymous hemianopsia. Using an endonasal endoscopic surgical approach, tumor removal was performed, with the residual tumor removed with a transcranial approach. Residual tumor tissue remained around the right cavernous sinus; therefore, SRT was performed 1 month after the second procedure, which resulted in good control of growth. Four years later, spontaneous CSF leakage occurred, for which endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed. One month later, CSF leakage recurred, and the same procedure was again used. A third episode of recurrent CSF leakage occurred 5 days later. A transcranial approach was finally used for repair, and the patient showed complete recovery. Conclusion(s): Late-onset CSF leakage after SRT for a pituitary adenoma can be intractable, and several aggressive repair procedures may be needed, including a combination of endonasal and transcranial approaches.

162,"Phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin alters chaperone function through loss of dimeric substructure Phosphorylation is the most common posttranslational modification of the alpha-crystallins in the human lens. These phosphorylated forms are not only important because of their abundance in aging lenses and the implications for cataract but also because they have been identified in patients with degenerative brain disease. By using mimics corresponding to the reported in vivo phosphorylation sites in the human lens, we have examined the effects of phosphorylation upon the chaperone-like properties and structure of alphaB-crystallin. Here we show that phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin at Ser-45 results in uncontrolled aggregation. By using an innovative tandem mass spectrometry approach, we demonstrate how this alteration in behavior stems from disruption of dimeric substructure within the polydisperse alphaB-crystallin assembly. This structural perturbation appears to disturb the housekeeping role of alphaB-crystallin and consequently has important implications for the disease states caused by protein aggregation in the lens and deposition in non-lenticular tissue.",Excluded

The paper covers cardiovascular and exercise physiology, barophysiology and decompression sickness, renal stone risk, immunology, neurovestibular and sensorimotor function, nutrition, pharmacotherapeutics, and reproduction. Potential health and functional impacts associated with the various physiological changes during spaceflight are discussed, and areas needing additional research are highlighted. Historically, studies of physiological responses to microgravity have not been aimed at examining gender-specific differences in the astronaut population. Insufficient data exist in most of the discipline areas at this time to draw valid conclusions about gender-specific differences in astronauts, in part due to the small ratio of women to men. The only astronaut health issue for which a large enough data set exists to allow valid conclusions to be drawn about gender differences is orthostatic intolerance following shuttle missions, in which women have a significantly higher incidence of presyncope during stand tests than do men. The most common observation across disciplines is that individual differences in physiological responses within genders are usually as large as, or larger than, differences between genders. Individual characteristics usually outweigh gender differences per se. [References: 65]",Excluded
2952,"Differential expression of Homer1a in the hippocampus and cortex likely plays a role in radiation-induced brain injury Fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation is the primary treatment for metastatic brain tumors. Despite reducing tumor burden and increasing lifespan, progressive, irreversible cognitive impairment occurs in >50% of the patients who survive >6 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this radiation-induced brain injury are unknown; however, preclinical studies suggest that radiation modulates the extracellular receptor kinase signaling pathway, which is associated with cognitive impairment in many neurological diseases. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the extracellular receptor kinase transcriptionally-regulated early response gene, Homer1a, was up-regulated transiently in the hippocampus and down-regulated in the cortex of young adult male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats at 48 h after 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation. Two months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation, these changes in Homer1a expression correlated with a down-regulation of the hippocampal glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma, and an up-regulation of cortical glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma. Two drugs that prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats, the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, reversed the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced Homer1a expression at 48 h in the hippocampus and cortex and restored glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma to the levels in sham-irradiated controls at 2 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. These data indicate that Homer1a is, (1) a brain region specific regulator of radiation-induced brain injury, including cognitive impairment and (2) potentially a druggable target for preventing it.",Included

Material(s) and Method(s): We intended to assess the clinical features and treatment outcome in patients of pineal parenchymal tumor attending our hospital from 2003-13. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): 23 patients met the study criterion (median age=22 years and male: female=14:9). Presenting complaints included headache (73.91%), visual symptoms (43.48%), vomiting (30.43%) and ataxia (26.09%). Preoperative contrast enhanced MRI and CT scan of brain were performed in 78.26% and 17.3% of patients respectively. Spinal drop metastasis and CSF cytology positivity were noted in 3 and 2 patients respectively. Surgery included gross total resection in 21.74%, near total resection in 13.04%, subtotal resection in 17.39% and tumor biopsy in 43.48% of the patients. 12 (52.17%) patients required the placement of VP shunt. Histopathology was confirmative of PB in 14 (60.87%) patients, PPTID in 6 (26.09%) patients and PC in 3 (13.04%) patients. MIB-1 labeling index varied from 2-80% with median value of 30% and 4.5% in PB and PPTID respectively. 22 (95.65%) patients underwent radiation therapy- craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in 14(60.87%) patients, whole brain radiation in 1 patient, whole ventricular radiation in 1 patient and local radiation in 6 (26.09%) patients. Majority (85.7%) of patients of PB underwent CSI- 36 Gy/ 20 fractions/ 4 weeks to whole brain followed by boost of 20 Gy/10 fractions/ 2 weeks to pineal region and 30-36 Gy/ 20 fractions/ 4 weeks to spinal axis as per risk stratification. Systemic chemotherapy was administered in 12 (52.17%) patients (11-PB and 1-PC) with EP (etoposide and carboplatin) being the most common regimen (30.43%). The median number of cycles administered was 6 (range 3-6). After a median follow-up of 26.87 months, death and recurrence were observed in 2 and 10 patients (local recurrence- 34.78% and spinal drop metastases- 26.09%) respectively. Median RFS was noted to be 2.33 years, 14.29 years and 6.76 years in patients of PB, PPTID and PC respectively. The 2 and 3 year actuarial RFS rates in the entire cohort were respectively 71.6% and 57.9%. Salvage treatment was offered in 6 patients. Median overall survival was not reached. On univariate analysis (Log rank test), age (<18 versus >18 years), sex, histology, extent of surgery (biopsy versus resection) and use of chemotherapy had no significant impact on RFS. Conclusion(s): Maximal safe resection followed by radiation therapy is the mainstay of treatment in pineal parenchymal tumor. Radiation volume encompasses the craniospinal axis in pinealoblastoma and the tumor bed with margin in pineocytoma. Platinum based combination chemotherapy should be added in adjuvant treatment in pinealoblastoma.",Excluded
1464,Acute effects of X irradiation on membrane potential and membrane resistance of snail neurones. [German] Acute X irradiation of the metacerebral giant neurons of Helix pomatia above 1000 R or 3.4 kR/min (dose or dose rate threshold) leads to a significant reduction of the membrane potential. After blocking the afferent excitatory synapses the radiation depolarizations are strongly decreased but not completely suppressed. Long time irradiation at high dose rates and after the blocking of afferent synapses produced a depolarization in 2 phases: an immediate quick depolarization of about 10 mV is followed by a much slower decrease of the membrane potential. Substitution of extracellular sodium by tris ions suppresses the quick depolarization phase. The input resistance of the cell shows a transient increase at the begin of irradiation followed by a substantial decrease. These results are discussed in view of the possible mechanisms of radiation induced permeability changes in excitable membranes.,Included

912,"Recurrent non-functioning pituitary adenomas: a review on the new pathological classification, management guidelines and treatment options At least 50% of surgically resected non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) recur. Either early or late adjuvant radiotherapy is highly efficacious in controlling recurrent NFPA but associates potentially burdensome complications like hypopituitarism, vascular complications or secondary neoplasm. Reoperation is indicated in bulky tumor rests compressing the optic pathway. To date, no standardized medical therapy is available for recurrent NFPA although cabergoline and temozolomide show promising results. Guidelines on the management of recurrent NFPAs are now available. The new 2017 WHO pituitary tumor classification, based on immunohistochemistry and transcription factor assessment, identifies a group of aggressive NFPA variants that may benefit from earlier adjuvant therapy. Nevertheless, NFPA patients exhibit a reduced overall life expectancy largely due to hypopituitarism and treatment-related morbidity. The management of recurrent NFPA benefits from a multidisciplinary teamwork of surgeons, endocrinologists, radiation oncologists, ophthalmologists, pathologists and neuro-radiologists in order to provide individualized therapy and anticipate deterioration.

291,"Photoinactivation of an identified motoneurone in the locust Locusta migratoria 1. The common inhibitory motoneurone 1 (CI1) in the mesothoracic ganglion of the locust was photoinactivated using a helium-cadmium laser or a mercury lamp as light source. Treated animals showed no signs of abnormal locomotory behaviour over periods of up to 40 days. 2. Photoinactivation of part of the neurone in the ganglion, i.e. the soma and the primary neurite, is sufficient to cause irreversible degeneration of all the peripheral extensions of the neurone. Three weeks after photoinactivation, all GABA immunoreactivity had disappeared from the axon branches of the photoinactivated neurone and from their terminals on one of the target muscles investigated, the anterior coxa rotator M92, and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials could no longer be elicited through stimulation. This was taken as proof of functional denervation of the muscle with regard to its inhibitory input. By this time, the axon of CI1 in nerve N3C1, which supplies M92, had also disappeared. 3. Animals treated during the fourth or fifth instars showed a permanent loss of the photoinactivated mesothoracic CI1 neurone after moulting into adulthood. 4. Denervation of M92 in the middle legs of instars and adults by axotomy of N3 always led to rapid functional reinnervation of the muscle. The first sign of reinnervation (excitatory neuromuscular activity upon mechanical stimulation of the tarsi) was detected electrophysiologically as early as 8 days after severing the motor nerve. 5. The elimination of CI1 by photoinactivation for a period of up to 40 days did not influence parameters of the target muscle, such as size, number of fibres and phenotypes of fibres defined histochemically according to their myofibrillar ATPase isoforms, irrespective of whether the operation was performed in instars or adults. Similarly, the short period of denervation following axotomy before reinnervation took place did not affect the fibre type composition of the muscle.",Excluded

This was done by examining in each group the intracellular activities of PCs mediated via CFs throughout maturation. From the third day in control rats, CF responses of PCs evoked by juxta fastigial region (JF) stimulation or occurring spontaneously already resembled the adult responses with, however, some important differences: (1) most of these responses were graded by steps with the intensity of the stimulation before day 13, due to the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs (see below); (2) immature CF responses exhibited a longer duration and their initial spike started near the peak of the EPSP instead of near the baseline later on. Finally, an anlage of CF response was already present in most PCs on day 2, and consisted of a single fast spike elicited near the peak of an underlying all-or-none EPSP. In the 3 groups of rats, CF EPSPs already closely resembled the adult ones as early as 3 days, although their total duration and especially their time to peak were longer. In control rats, these CF EPSPs reversed with depolarizing currents from day 3 and currents for reversal were much lower than in the adult. 'Dual' CF EPSPs of PCS37 were encountered in immature 7- to 10-day-old controls, and persisted in hypothyroid rats until the end of the third postnatal week. The mono- or the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was ascertained in th 3 groups according to the graded or the all-or-none character of CF EPSPs, and the number of CFs impinging on a given PC was estimated by the number of steps in the response. In control rats, most of PCs were already multiply innervated by CFs as early as 3 days. The multiple innervation culminated on day 5 with an average number of 3.4 CFs for PC, and rapidly regressed later on, so that the adult-type monoinnervation was the rule after day 13. In hypothyroid rats, the establishment of the redundancy and its regression was delayed by 2--3 days. In X-irradiated rats, the settlement and the involution of the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was exactly superimposed with that seen in controls until day 8. Later on, regression of the supernumerary contacts no longer occurred so that most PCs remained multiply innervated until adulthood. Finally, the first clear-cut IPSPs were detected in PCs on day 9 in control and X-irradiated rats and 2--3 days later in hypothyroid animals.",Excluded

The aim of this study is to assess the appropriate timing of WBRT for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and brain metastases (BM).METHODS: There were 78 patients diagnosed with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and BM in Beijing Chest Hospital between August 2009 and May 2015. 48 untreated patients who received both WBRT and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy. Prognostic factors of intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were identified by Cox proportional hazards modeling.RESULTS: Intracranial objective response rate was 81.3% and disease control rate was 93.8%. Median intracranial PFS was 10 months. Median OS was 18 months. Multivariate analysis of intracranial PFS revealed that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1 (HR=30.436, 95%CI: 4.721-196.211, P<0.001) and early WBRT (HR=3.663, 95%CI: 1.657-8.098, P=0.001) had a better intracranial PFS. Multivariate analysis of OS revealed that PS 0-1 (HR=57.607, 95%CI: 6.135-540.953, P<0.001), early WBRT (HR=2.757, 95%CI: 1.140-6.669, P=0.024), and stereotactic radiosurgery (HR=5.964, 95%CI: 1.895-18.767, P=0.002) were independent prognostic factors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: Early WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs can improve outcomes of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and BM, but it needs to be confirmed by large-sample-size and multicenter prospective clinical trials.",Excluded

2838,"Diencephalic locomotor region in the lamprey--afferents and efferent control In vertebrates, locomotion can be initiated by stimulation of the diencephalic locomotor region (DLR). Little is known of the different forebrain regions that provide input to the neurons in DLR. In the lamprey, it had been shown previously that DLR provides monosynaptic input to reticulospinal neurons, which in turn elicit rhythmic ventral root activity at the spinal level. To show that actual locomotor movements are produced from DLR, we use a semi-intact preparation in which the brain stem is exposed and the head fixed, while the body is left to generate actual swimming movements. DLR stimulation induced symmetric locomotor movements with an undulatory wave transmitted along the body. To explore if DLR is under tonic GABAergic input under resting conditions, as in mammals, GABAergic antagonists and agonists were locally administered into DLR. Injections of GABA agonists inhibited locomotion, whereas GABA antagonists facilitated the induction of locomotion. These findings suggest that GABAergic projections provide tonic inhibition that once turned off can release locomotion. Double-labeling experiments were carried out to identify GABAergic projections to the DLR. Populations of GABAergic projection neurons to DLR originated in the caudoventral portion of the medial pallium, the lateral and dorsal pallium, and the striatal area. These different GABAergic projection neurons, which also project to other brain stem motor centers, may represent the basal ganglia output to DLR. Moreover, electrical stimulation of striatum induced long-lasting plateau potentials in reticulospinal cells and associated locomotor episodes dependent on DLR being intact, suggesting that striatum may act via the basal ganglia output identified here.",Excluded

Drugs were administered intraperitoneally after the first afterdischarge and stimulation was repeated five more times with the same intensity.

Therefore, the effects of pregnanolone and a new derivative THDOC-conjugate (20 and 40 mg/kg) were compared with those of allopregnanolone (40 mg/kg) only in 12- and 25-day-old rats in the second part of study. All three neurosteroids blocked progressive prolongation of repeated ADs seen in control 12-day-old rats. In addition, pregnanolone was able to shorten the ADs. In contrast, duration of ADs in 25-day-old animals was significantly shorter than the duration of the first, predrug AD only after administration of the 40 mg/kg dose of pregnanolone; if corresponding ADs in the control and drug groups were compared, pregnanolone and THDOC-conjugate led to significantly shorter ADs, changes after allopregnanolone administration were statistically significant only in the fourth AD. None of the studied neurosteroids was able to suppress movements directly bound to stimulation as well as clonic seizures accompanying afterdischarges. Among the three drugs studied, pregnanolone was found to be the most potent one.

Method(s): We reviewed 658 patients with limited-stage SCLC treated in 1986-2009 at a single institution with definitive concurrent chemoradiation to a total radiation dose of 45-70 Gy. Variables investigated for possible association with OS included patient sex, age, ethnicity, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, year of diagnosis and treatment period (1986-1999 vs. 2000-2009), tumor size, radiation dose, cycles of induction chemotherapy, use of intensity-modulated-radiation-therapy (IMRT), and fractionation. Groups were compared with chi-square tests for categorical variables or medians tests for continuous variables. Kaplan-Meier estimates were constructed for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local-recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Result(s): Among 658 patients, 507 patients were <70 years old (Group A) and 151 patients were >=70 years old (Group B). Median survival time was significantly longer in the younger group (25.6 months vs. 20.3 months, P=0.007), but no differences were found in DFS, LRFS, or DMFS time by age. Of the 151 patients aged >=70 years (54 of whom received PCI and 89 did not), those treated in 2000-2009 (vs. 1986-1999) had better brain MFS than those treated in 1986-1999 (P=0.048); those who received PCI had better brain MFS than those who did not (P=0.033). Multivariate analysis showed that among patients aged >=70, receiving PCI, not receiving induction chemotherapy, and local-regional control were associated with fewer brain metastases (for PCI, subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]=0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.95, P=0.037; for induction chemotherapy, SHR=0.43, 95% CI=0.19-0.96, P=0.039; and for local-regional failure, SHR=0.996, 95% CI=0.993- 0.998, P=0.001). Among patients >=70, receipt of PCI seemed to have been associated with better OS for those with small-volume disease (primary+nodal disease <5 cm, P=0.0545) but not for those with larger-volume disease (P=0.7387). Conclusion(s): Patients aged >=70 years with small-volume limited-stage SCLC seemed to show a benefit in OS from the use of PCI, but those with larger-volume disease did not. Improved brain MFS was associated with use of PCI, no induction chemotherapy, and locoregional control.",Excluded
1398,"Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Functional Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta) Activity and Benefit of TGFbeta Inhibition in Irradiated Intracranial Tumors Purpose: Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) promotes cell survival by endorsing DNA damage repair and mediates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, TGFbeta activation in response to radiation therapy is potentially targetable because it opposes therapeutic control. Strategies to assess this potential in the clinic are needed. Methods and Materials: We evaluated positron emission tomography (PET) to image <sup>89</sup>Zr -fresolimumab, a humanized TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, as a means to detect TGFbeta activation in intracranial tumor models. Pathway activity of TGFbeta was validated by immunodetection of phosphorylated SMAD2 and the TGFbeta target, tenascin. The contribution of TGFbeta to radiation response was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of mice bearing intracranial murine tumor models GL261 and SB28 glioblastoma and brain-adapted 4T1 breast cancer (4T1-BrA) treated with TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 1D11, and/or focal radiation (10 Gy). Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detected engineered, physiological, and radiation-induced TGFbeta activation, which was confirmed by immunostaining of biological markers. GL261 glioblastoma tumors had a greater PET signal compared with similar-sized SB28 glioblastoma tumors, whereas the widespread PET signal of 4T1-BrA intracranial tumors was consistent with their highly dispersed histologic distribution. Survival of mice bearing intracranial tumors treated with 1D11 neutralizing antibody alone was similar to that of mice treated with control antibody, whereas 1D11 improved survival when given in combination with focal radiation. The extent of survival benefit of a combination of radiation and 1D11 was associated with the degree of TGFbeta activity detected by PET. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detects radiation-induced TGFbeta activation in tumors. Functional imaging indicated a range of TGFbeta activity in intracranial tumors, but TGFbeta blockade provided survival benefit only in the context of radiation treatment. This study provides further evidence that radiation-induced TGFbeta activity opposes therapeutic response to radiation. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1560,"Diurnal changes in retinula cell sensitivities and receptive fields (two-dimensional angular sensitivity functions) in the apposition eyes of Ligia exotica (Crustacea, Isopoda) The structural organization of the retinula cells in the eye of Ligia exotica changes diurnally. At night, the microvilli elongate, losing the regular and parallel alignment characteristic of the day condition. Crystalline cones and distal rhabdom tips are not pushed into each other during the day, but at night the rhabdoms protrude into the crystalline cones by up to 5 microm. Screening pigment granules in the retinula cells disperse during the night, but migrate radially towards the vicinity of the rhabdom during the day. No such displacements of the pigment granules of either distal or proximal screening pigment cells were observed. The sensitivity of the eye, monitored by electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, changes diurnally: values at midnight are, on average, 10 times those occurring during the day. However, intracellular recordings from single retinula cells (50 during the day and 50 at night) indicate that the difference between night and day sensitivities is only 2.5-fold. Two-dimensional angular sensitivity curves, indicative of a single unit's spatial sensitivity, had considerably less regular outlines at night than during the day. If based on the 50 % sensitivity level, day and night eyes possessed receptive fields of almost identical width (approximately 2 degrees), but if sensitivities below the 50 % limit were included, then receptive fields at night were significantly more extensive. We suggest that the morphological adaptations and diurnal changes in chromophore content seen in the apposition eye of L. exotica allow this animal to improve its photon capture at night while preserving at least some of the spatial resolving power characteristic of the light-adapted state. This would explain why this animal is capable of performing complex escape behaviours in the presence of predators both in bright and in very dim light.",Excluded

At 2 months post-irradiation, cellular markers of inflammation (total, activated, and newborn microglia) and neurogenesis (newborn neurons) were measured in 40 mum sections of the dentate gyrus (DG).RESULTS: Although the total number of microglia in the DG/hilus was not significantly different (p > 0.7) in unirradiated, single dose, and fWBI rats, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.003) increase in the percent-activated microglia; fWBI did not (p > 0.1). Additionally, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.002) dose-dependent increase in surviving newborn microglia; fWBI did not (p < 0.8). Although total proliferation in the DG was reduced equally by single and fWBI doses, single doses produced a significant dose-dependent (p < 0.02) decrease in surviving newborn neurons; fWBI did not (p > 0.6).CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the rat brain's cellular response to single doses often does not predict its cellular response to 'biologically equivalent' fWBI doses.",Included

However, the use of visible light for optogenetic stimulation is invasive due to low penetration depth and tissue damage owing to larger absorption and scattering. Here, we report, for the first time, in-depth non-scanning fiber-optic two-photon optogenetic stimulation (FO-TPOS) of neurons in-vivo in transgenic mouse models. In order to optimize the deep-brain stimulation strategy, we characterized two-photon activation efficacy at different near-infrared laser parameters. The significantly-enhanced in-depth stimulation efficiency of FO-TPOS as compared to conventional single-photon beam was demonstrated both by experiments and Monte Carlo simulation. The non-scanning FO-TPOS technology will lead to better understanding of the in-vivo neural circuitry because this technology permits more precise and less invasive anatomical delivery of stimulation.",Excluded
1350,"An acoustic window to the urinary bladder: Usual and unusual pathologies Background Information: The acoustic properties of urinary fluid and the superficial location of the bladder make it an excellent candidate for sonographic evaluation. In addition to being a quick and portable screening modality and offering the added benefit of not exposing the patient to ionizing radiation, ultrasound can definitively diagnose a variety of pathologic processes of the bladder, both benign and malignant. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Briefly discuss ultrasound technique used in optimal evaluation of the bladder. Discuss normal sonographic appearance of the bladder. Illustrate and describe the imaging appearance associated with a variety of both benign and malignant bladder pathologies. Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Using ultrasound as the primary imaging modality, and with CT and MRI support, a variety of common and not so common pathologies of the bladder will be illustrated and discussed. These will include benign entities such as cystitis, calculi, bladder hernias, neurogenic bladder, ureterocele, bladder rupture and fistulization, foreign bodies, bladder endometriosis, and pseudotumors. Malignant processes such as urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and metastatic disease will also be included. The emphasis will be on the role of ultrasound in narrowing the differential, and in suggesting the need for further radiologic or urologic evaluation. Conclusion(s): Ultrasound has emerged as a first-line modality in the radiological evaluation of the urinary bladder.

The results compare well to those for free space irradiation. At resonance, for E along the long dimension (a), a power deposition nine times higher than that for the H parallel a orientation is observed. For rats in the k parallel a configuration, the frequencies of peak absorption and the maximum absorption at these values demonstrate W-1/3 and W 2/3 dependencies, respectively, upon the weight W of the animal.

2205,"The effect of rowing ergometry and resistive exercise on skeletal muscle structure and function during bed rest Exposure to microgravity causes functional and structural impairment of skeletal muscle. Current exercise regimens are time-consuming and insufficiently effective; an integrated countermeasure is needed that addresses musculoskeletal along with cardiovascular health. High-intensity, short-duration rowing ergometry and supplemental resistive strength exercise may achieve these goals. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers completed 5 wk of head-down-tilt bed rest (HDBR): 18 were randomized to exercise, 9 remained sedentary. Exercise consisted of rowing ergometry 6 days/wk, including interval training, and supplemental strength training 2 days/wk. Measurements before and after HDBR and following reambulation included assessment of strength, skeletal muscle volume (MRI), and muscle metabolism (magnetic resonance spectroscopy); quadriceps muscle biopsies were obtained to assess muscle fiber types, capillarization, and oxidative capacity. Sedentary bed rest (BR) led to decreased muscle volume (quadriceps: -9 +/- 4%, P < 0.001; plantar flexors: -19 +/- 6%, P < 0.001). Exercise (ExBR) reduced atrophy in the quadriceps (-5 +/- 4%, interaction P = 0.018) and calf muscle, although to a lesser degree (-14 +/- 6%, interaction P = 0.076). Knee extensor and plantar flexor strength was impaired by BR (-14 +/- 15%, P = 0.014 and -22 +/- 7%, P = 0.001) but preserved by ExBR (-4 +/- 13%, P = 0.238 and +13 +/- 28%, P = 0.011). Metabolic capacity, as assessed by maximal O2 consumption, (31)P-MRS, and oxidative chain enzyme activity, was impaired in BR but stable or improved in ExBR. Reambulation reversed the negative impact of BR. High-intensity, short-duration rowing and supplemental strength training effectively preserved skeletal muscle function and structure while partially preventing atrophy in key antigravity muscles. Due to its integrated cardiovascular benefits, rowing ergometry could be a primary component of exercise prescriptions for astronauts or patients suffering from severe deconditioning.",Excluded
774,"Chemical basis of reactive oxygen species reactivity and involvement in neurodegenerative diseases Increasing numbers of individuals suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by progressive loss of neurons. Oxidative stress, in particular, the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), play an important role in the development of these diseases, as evidenced by the detection of products of lipid, protein and DNA oxidation in vivo. Even if they participate in cell signaling and metabolism regulation, ROS are also formidable weapons against most of the biological materials because of their intrinsic nature. By nature too, neurons are particularly sensitive to oxidation because of their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, weak antioxidant defense and high oxygen consumption. Thus, the overproduction of ROS in neurons appears as particularly deleterious and the mechanisms involved in oxidative degradation of biomolecules are numerous and complexes. This review highlights the production and regulation of ROS, their chemical properties, both from kinetic and thermodynamic points of view, the links between them, and their implication in neurodegenerative diseases.

At 24 h after induction of ICH, rats were randomly separated into three experimental groups: ICH with injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS group), ICH with intravenous injection of magnetosome-like ferrimagnetic iron oxide nanocubes (FION)-labeled SNMs (SNMs* group), and ICH with intravenous injection of FION-labeled SNMs followed by three days of external magnetic field exposure for targeted delivery by a magnet-embedded helmet (SNMs*+Helmet group). On day 3 after ICH induction, an increased Prussian blue-stained area and decreased swelling volume were observed in the SNMs*+Helmet group compared with that of the other groups. A significantly decreased recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils and a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines followed by improved neurological function three days after ICH were observed in the SNMs*+Helmet group. Hemispheric atrophy at six weeks after ICH was significantly decreased in the SNMs*+Helmet group compared with that of the PBS group. In conclusion, we have developed a targeted delivery system using FION tagged to stem cells and a magnet-embedded helmet.

1421,"Autoradiographic study of cell kinetics after whole-body x-ray irradiation. II. Study of the patterns of the postradiation death of differentiating and proliferating cells in the subependymal zone of the rat brain. [Russian] The post-irradiation cell kinetics was studied in vivo autoradiographically with 3H-thymidine, injected 60-80 minutes before the whole body X-irradiation of rats in doses of 50, 150 or 300 R. The wavy character of death was shown in the proliferating and differentiating rat's brain subependymal cells. After cell irradiation in G2- and S-phases four peaks of labeled mitotic cells with pycnotic nuclei (""mitotic death"") were recorded. The application of the double labelling technique with 3H- and 14C-thymidine showed that the lethally damaged cells irradiated in G1-phase had lost their ability to synthesize DNA. The nuclei of these cells became pycnotic later than 4 hours after irradiation, as follows indirectly from data recorded by Shmakova et al. (1972). The conformity in the time and alternation of the death peak appearance of differentiating cells and of the appearance of the death peaks and mitoses in proliferating cells enabled us to assume the persistence of the cycle (""short cycle"") in differentiating cells with the rhythm similar to that in the mitotic cycle. All the cells of the system were blocked during one hour, independently of the dose of irradiation, in one of six points of the cycle (mitotic cycle, short cycle). All these data suggest that the death of the differentiating cells and of cells which at the time of irradiation were in G1-phase could be timed to the final phase of the cycle (short cycle, mitotic cycle), coinciding in time with M-phase of the mitotic cycle.",Included

Method(s): The data regarding 88 patients who had been surgically treated for histologically confirmed spinal cord intramedullary and extramedullary ependymoma from January 1989 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Histopathological examination revealed myxopapillary ependymoma in 24 patients, ependymoma in 61 patients, and anaplastic ependymoma in 3 patients. Gross total removal was achieved in 72 patients, subtotal removal in 15 patients, and partial removal in 1 patient. Twenty patients were treated with postoperative radiation. Fifty-two patients had stable or improved postoperative neurological function, while 36 experienced neurological deterioration. A permanent decrease in McCormick classification grade was seen in 17 patients. The progression-free survival rate was 87% for all patients at 5 years and 80% at 10 years. During follow-up, local recurrence/progression was seen in 13 patients. Diffuse meningeal spread developed in 2 anaplastic ependymoma patients. Postoperative radiotherapy after incomplete resection did not significantly correlate with longer times to recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed histology and surgical extent of resection as independent predictors of longer progression-free survival. Conclusion(s): Gross total removal alone is a good treatment strategy for spinal ependymomas. Early diagnosis and surgery, before severe paralysis, are important to obtain good functional outcomes. Subtotal resection with radiation therapy for intramedullary lesions appears to offer no advantages over gross total removal. Â© 2013 The Author(s).",Included

120,"An optical marker based on the UV-induced green-to-red photoconversion of a fluorescent protein We have cloned a gene encoding a fluorescent protein from a stony coral, Trachyphyllia geoffroyi, which emits green, yellow, and red light. The protein, named Kaede, includes a tripeptide, His-Tyr-Gly, that acts as a green chromophore that can be converted to red. The red fluorescence is comparable in intensity to the green and is stable under usual aerobic conditions. We found that the green-red conversion is highly sensitive to irradiation with UV or violet light (350-400 nm), which excites the protonated form of the chromophore. The excitation lights used to elicit red and green fluorescence do not induce photoconversion. Under a conventional epifluorescence microscope, Kaede protein expressed in HeLa cells turned red in a graded fashion in response to UV illumination; maximal illumination resulted in a 2,000-fold increase in the ratio of red-to-green signal. These color-changing properties provide a simple and powerful technique for regional optical marking. A focused UV pulse creates an instantaneous plane source of red Kaede within the cytosol. The red spot spreads rapidly throughout the cytosol, indicating its free diffusibility in the compartment. The extensive diffusion allows us to delineate a single neuron in a dense culture, where processes originating from many different somata are present. Illumination of a focused UV pulse onto the soma of a Kaede-expressing neuron resulted in filling of all processes with red fluorescence, allowing visualization of contact sites between the red and green neurons of interest.",Excluded

3345,"Inhibiting the inhibition: a neuronal network for sound localization in reverberant environments The precedence effect describes the phenomenon whereby echoes are spatially fused to the location of an initial sound by selectively suppressing the directional information of lagging sounds (echo suppression). Echo suppression is a prerequisite for faithful sound localization in natural environments but can break down depending on the behavioral context. To date, the neural mechanisms that suppress echo directional information without suppressing the perception of echoes themselves are not understood. We performed in vivo recordings in Mongolian gerbils of neurons of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL), a GABAergic brainstem nucleus that targets the auditory midbrain, and show that these DNLL neurons exhibit inhibition that persists tens of milliseconds beyond the stimulus offset, so-called persistent inhibition (PI). Using in vitro recordings, we demonstrate that PI stems from GABAergic projections from the opposite DNLL. Furthermore, these recordings show that PI is attributable to intrinsic features of this GABAergic innervation. Implementation of these physiological findings into a neuronal model of the auditory brainstem demonstrates that, on a circuit level, PI creates an enhancement of responsiveness to lagging sounds in auditory midbrain cells. Moreover, the model revealed that such response enhancement is a sufficient cue for an ideal observer to identify echoes and to exhibit echo suppression, which agrees closely with the percepts of human subjects.",Excluded

A two-step procedure was designed to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulus and exogenous gene delivery for inducing neurogenesis. First, an electrical stimulation device was designed using gold nanoparticles adsorbed to the surface of a cover glass. Gold nanoparticles, as an electrical conductor for stem cells, are well-defined particles adsorbed to a polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated cover glass. The nanoparticle morphology was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Second, a plasmid carrying Nurr1 cDNA was complexed with biodegradable poly-(DL)-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles to support neurogenesis. To evaluate the neuronal differentiation of stem cells mediated by the treatment with either electrical stimulation and exogenous Nurr1 gene delivery, or both, the expression of neuron-specific genes and proteins was examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cells transfected with exogenous Nurr1 genes plus electrical stimulation (250 mV for 1000 s) showed the greatest level of neurite outgrowth with a mean neurite length of 150 mum. Neurite length in cells treated with only one stimulus was not significant, approximately 10-20 mum.

3120,"Growth factor gene-modified mesenchymal stem cells in tissue regeneration There have been marked changes in the field of stem cell therapeutics in recent years, with many clinical trials having been conducted to date in an effort to treat myriad diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the cell type most frequently utilized in stem cell therapeutic and tissue regenerative strategies, and have been used with excellent safety to date. Unfortunately, these MSCs have limited ability to engraft and survive, reducing their clinical utility. MSCs are able to secrete growth factors that can support the regeneration of tissues, and engineering MSCs to express such growth factors can improve their survival, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue reconstructing abilities. As such, it is likely that such genetically modified MSCs may represent the next stage of regenerative therapy. Indeed, increasing volumes of preclinical research suggests that such modified MSCs expressing growth factors can effectively treat many forms of tissue damage.

462,Retinal photoreceptor fine structure in the short-tailed stingray (Dasyatis brevicaudata) The fine structure of the retinal photoreceptors has been studied by light and electron microscopy in the short-tailed stingray (Dasyatis brevicaudata). The duplex retina of this elasmobranch contains rods and cones in a ratio of about 10:1. No multiple receptors were noted nor was a repeating or mosaic arrangement of the cones obvious. Only light-adapted specimens were studied but retinomotor movements of the photoreceptors were felt to be minimal or absent. The rods are large cylindrical cells with inner and outer segments of much the same diameter. Cones are short stout cells with a conical outer segment and a wider inner segment. Rod outer segment discs show peripheral incisures while cones do not. The inner segment of rods and cones are rich in organelles indicating much synthetic activity. The nuclei of rods and cones appear quite similar but cone nuclei are invariably at least partially protruded through the external limiting membrane which is formed by a series of zonulae adherentes between photoreceptor cells and Muller cells. The synaptic region of both rods and cones display both invaginated (ribbon) synapses and superficial (conventional) synapses.,Excluded
2505,"Radiation-induced trismus in the ARTSCAN head and neck trial UNLABELLED: Trismus, a well-known sequelae after treatment of head and neck cancer, decreases a patient's oral function and quality of life. The main objectives of this study were to: 1) investigate the long-term prevalence of radiation-induced trismus in patients treated for head and neck cancer according to two different fractionation schedules; and 2) model a dose-response relationship for trismus.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Swedish ARTSCAN trial, a prospective randomised multicentre study comparing conventional and accelerated fractionation. A total of 124 patients agreed to a clinical ENT examination 21-127 months (median 66 months) after beginning radiation therapy. Trismus-related scores were assessed using the EORTC H&N35 Quality of Life questionnaire. The TheraBite( R) range of motion scale was used to measure maximal interincisal distance. The dose-response relationship for structures important for mastication and the temporomandibular joints was investigated by normal tissue complication probability modelling.RESULTS: No significant differences in patient-reported trismus or maximal interincisal distance were found between the two trial arms. Patient-reported moderate to high scores regarding trismus increased from 3% at the start of radiation therapy to 25% at the long-term follow-up. Maximal interincisal distance correlated significantly with patient-reported scores of trismus. The best dose-response fit to the endpoint data was found for the dose to the ipsilateral masseter.CONCLUSIONS: Trismus is a persistent complication after radiotherapy with 3D-conformal radiation therapy. We found no difference between the severity and prevalence of trismus between conventional and accelerated fractionation, but a significant correlation between the absorbed dose to the mastication structures and opening of the mouth.

3501,"Effects of Proton and Combined Proton and (56)Fe Radiation on the Hippocampus The space radiation environment contains protons and (56)Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to space flight crews during and after missions. The space environment involves complex radiation exposures, thus, the effects of a dose of protons might be modulated by a dose of heavy-ion radiation. The brain, and particularly the hippocampus, may be susceptible to space radiation-induced changes. In this study, we first determined the dose-response effect of proton radiation (150 MeV) on hippocampus-dependent cognition 1 and 3 months after exposure. Based on those results, we subsequently exposed mice to protons alone (150 MeV, 0.1 Gy), (56)Fe alone (600 MeV/n, 0.5 Gy) or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations (protons first) with the two exposures separated by 24 h. At one month postirradiation, all animal groups showed novel object recognition. However, at three months postirradiation, mice exposed to either protons or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations showed impaired novel object recognition, which was not observed in mice irradiated with (56)Fe alone. The mechanisms in these impairments might involve inflammation. In mice irradiated with protons alone or (56)Fe alone three months earlier, there was a negative correlation between a measure of novel object recognition and the number of newly born activated microglia in the dentate gyrus. Next, cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed in the hippocampus. At one month after exposure the levels of IL-12 were higher in mice exposed to combined radiations compared with sham-irradiated mice, while the levels of IFN-gamma were lower in mice exposed to (56)Fe radiation alone or combined radiations. In addition, IL-4 levels were lower in (56)Fe-irradiated mice compared with proton-irradiated mice and TNF-alpha levels were lower in proton-irradiated mice than in mice receiving combined radiations. At three months after exposure, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and eotaxin levels were lower in mice receiving combined radiations. The levels of MDC and eotaxin correlated and the levels of MDC, but not eotaxin, correlated with the percentage of newly born activated microglia in the blades of the dentate gyrus. Finally, hippocampal IL-6 levels were higher in mice receiving combined radiations compared with mice receiving (56)Fe radiation alone. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of novel object recognition for detecting cognitive injury three months after exposure to proton radiation alone, and combined exposure to proton and (56)Fe radiations, and that newly-born activated microglia and inflammation might be involved in this injury.",Included

2355,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for metastatic melanoma: An analysis of survival, outcome, and complications OBJECTIVE: Although the mainstays for treatment of metastatic brain disease have been surgery and/or external beam radiation therapy, an increasing number of patients are being referred for stereotactic radiosurgery as the primary intervention for their intracranial pathological abnormalities. The lack of efficacy and cognitive and behavioral consequences of whole brain irradiation have prompted clinicians to select patients for alternative therapies. This study analyzes the effectiveness of Leksell gamma unit therapy for metastatic melanoma to the brain. METHOD(S): We present our experience with 59 Leksell gamma unit treatment sessions in 45 consecutive patients who presented with metastatic melanoma to the brain. Five of these procedures were performed as salvage therapy for patients who needed second radiosurgical treatment for new lesions that were remote from the previous targets and were not included in the overall analyses. RESULT(S): The population included 78% male patients. The mean patient age was 53 years (age range, 24-80 yr). The mean time from diagnosis of primary melanoma to discovery of brain metastasis was 43 months (median, 27.5 mo; range, 1-180 mo). At the time of diagnosis of brain disease, 35.5% of the patients (16 of 45 patients) had neurological symptoms, 77.7% (35 of 45 patients) had known visceral metastases, and 11.1% (5 of 45 patients) had seizure disorders. Eighty-six percent of the lesions (80 of 93 lesions) were cortical, 12% (11 of 93 lesions) were cerebellar, 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were pontine, and 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were thalamic. Fifty-seven percent of the sessions (31 of 54 sessions) were performed for a single lesion, 24.1% (13 of 54 sessions) for two lesions, 9.2% (5 of 54 sessions) for three lesions, 7.4% (4 of 54 sessions) for four lesions, and 1.8% (1 of 54 sessions) for five lesions. The mean treatment volume was 5.6 cc, with a mean prescription of 21.6 Gy to the 56.0% mean isodose line. The median survival time of the patients in our population, using Kaplan-Meier curves, was 43 months from the time of diagnosis of primary melanoma (range, 3-180 mo) and 8 months (range, 1-20 mo) from the time of gamma knife treatment. Complications included seizures within 24 hours of the procedure in four patients, with transient nausea and vomiting in three patients, transient worsening of preprocedure paresis responsive to steroids in three patients, and increased confusion in one patient. All 45 patients were located for follow-up (mean follow-up duration, 1 yr). After gamma knife treatment, 78% of the patients (35 of 45 patients) experienced either improved or stable neurological symptomatology before death or at the time of the latest follow-up examination. There were 26 deaths (58%). The cause of death was determined to be neurological in only 2 of 45 patients (7.7%). Follow-up magnetic resonance images revealed a 97% local tumor control rate of gamma knife-treated lesions, with 28% radiographic disappearance (9 of 32 cases). Six patients developed new lesions remote from radiosurgical targets and underwent second procedures. CONCLUSION(S): Although metastatic melanoma to the brain continues to have a foreboding prognosis for long-term survival, gamma knife radiosurgery seems to be a relatively safe, noninvasive, palliative therapy, halting or reversing neurological progression in 77.8% of treated patients (35 of 45 patients). The survival rate matches or exceeds those previously reported for surgery and other forms of radiotherapy. Only 7.7% of the patients in our study population who died as a result of metastatic melanoma (2 of 26 patients) died as a result of neurological disease. The routine use of therapeutic level antiseizure medication is emphasized, considering the findings of our review.",Excluded
3609,"Effects of Preoperative Simulation on Minimally Invasive Hybrid Lumbar Interbody Fusion OBJECTIVE: The main focus of this study was to evaluate how preoperative simulation affects the surgical work flow, radiation exposure, and outcome of minimally invasive hybrid lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-HLIF).METHODS: A total of 132 patients who underwent single-level MIS-HLIF were enrolled in a cohort study design. Dose area product was analyzed in addition to surgical data. Once preoperative simulation was established, 66 cases (SIM cohort) were compared with 66 patients who had previously undergone MIS-HLIF without preoperative simulation (NO-SIM cohort).RESULTS: Dose area product was reduced considerably in the SIM cohort (320 cGy.cm<sup>2</sup> NO-SIM cohort: 470 cGy.cm<sup>2</sup>; P < 0.01). Surgical time was shorter for the SIM cohort (155 minutes; NO-SIM cohort, 182 minutes; P < 0.05). SIM cohort had a better outcome in Numeric Rating Scale back at 6 months follow-up compared with the NO-SIM cohort (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative simulation reduced radiation exposure and resulted in less back pain at the 6 months follow-up time point. Preoperative simulation provided guidance in determining the correct cage height. Outcome controls enabled the surgeon to improve the procedure and the software algorithm.",Excluded
1095,"Preclinical safety assessment of the 5-HT2A receptor agonist PET radioligand [ 11C]Cimbi-36 PURPOSE: [11C]Cimbi-36 was recently developed as an agonist radioligand for brain imaging of serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2A) with positron emission tomography (PET). This may be used to quantify the high-affinity state of 5-HT2A receptors and may have the potential to quantify changes in cerebral 5-HT levels in vivo. We here investigated safety aspects related to clinical use of [11C]Cimbi-36, including radiation dosimetry and in vivo pharmacology.PROCEDURES: [11C]Cimbi-36 was injected in rats or pigs, and radiation dosimetry was examined by ex vivo dissection or with PET scanning, respectively. Based on animal data, the Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment software was used to estimate extrapolated human dosimetry for [11C]Cimbi-36. The 5-HT2A receptor agonist actions of [11C]Cimbi-36 in vivo pharmacological effects in mice elicited by increasing doses of Cimbi-36 were assessed with the head-twitch response (HTR).RESULTS: The effective dose as extrapolated from both rat and pig data was low, 7.67 and 4.88 muSv/MBq, respectively. In addition, the estimated absorbed radiation dose to human target organs did not exceed safety levels. Administration of 0.5 mg/kg Cimbi-36 leads to significant HTR compared to saline, whereas 0.05 mg/kg Cimbi-36 (doses much larger than those given in conjunction with a PET scan) did not elicit a significant HTR.CONCLUSIONS: Administration of tracer doses of [11C]Cimbi-36 does not seem to be associated with unusual radiation burden or adverse clinical effects.",Excluded
2471,"Endothelial apoptosis initiates acute blood-brain barrier disruption after ionizing radiation Acute disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) is well recognized after radiation therapy to the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed the genetic regulation of acute BBB disruption and its relationship to vascular endothelial cell death in the CNS after irradiation. Adult rats were given graded single doses of X-ray to the cervical spinal cord. At different time intervals after irradiation, the irradiated spinal cord was processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Disruption of blood-spinal cord barrier was assessed using albumin immunohistochemistry, i.v. injection of Evans blue dye, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. In the rat spinal cord, there was a dose-dependent apoptotic response during the first 24 h after irradiation, and apoptotic cells consisted of both endothelial and glial cells, as described previously (1, 2). A dose-dependent reduction in endothelial cell density was observed at 24 h after irradiation. This was associated with a similar dose-dependent disruption in blood-spinal cord barrier as demonstrated by albumin immunohistochemistry. Radiation-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells has been shown to be dependent on the acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) pathway. After a single 50-Gy dose to the cervical spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was a 47.7% reduction in endothelial cell density at 24 h compared with nonirradiated controls. No decrease in endothelial cell density was observed in irradiated ASMase -/- mice. In the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was evidence of albumin immunoreactivity and Evans blue dye staining around microvessels, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid uptake increased at 24 h. Nonirradiated controls and the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase -/- mice demonstrated no evidence of leakage. We conclude that apoptosis of endothelial cells initiates acute BBB disruption in the CNS after irradiation and that acute BBB disruption after irradiation is mediated by the ASMase pathway.",Included

1434,"Ultrastructural morphometry of parotid acinar cells following fractionated irradiation The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term effects on the ultrastructure of parotid glands after fractionated irradiation. The method implemented involved 5 x 6 Gy and 5 x 8 Gy, Monday to Friday 6 MV photons. By unilateral irradiation, the contralateral parotid gland served as a control. Although irradiation diminished the acinar cell density in light microscopic sections from 75 to 32% after 5 x 8 Gy of irradiation, ultrastructural morphometry could not detect any statistically significant differences in acinar cell size, nuclear size, nuclear density, granule area, mean granule size, or granule density. In general, greater differences were seen between rats receiving 30 or 40 Gy, on both the irradiated and the control size, than between the irradiated side and the control side. This was interpreted as due to differences in the nutritional state of the animals. This analysis concluded that individual acinar cells that survive irradiation seem not to be damaged in the long term when evaluated at the ultrastructural level. The study further stresses the importance of adequate sampling sizes and the use of adequate controls.",Excluded

1681,"Quality of life after palliative treatment for oesophageal carcinoma - A prospective comparison between stent placement and single dose brachytherapy Metal stent placement and single dose brachytherapy are commonly used treatment modalities for the palliation of inoperable oesophageal carcinoma. We investigated generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after these palliative treatments. Patients with dysphagia from inoperable oesophageal carcinoma were randomised to placement of a covered Ultraflex stent (n=108) or single dose (12 Gy) brachytherapy (n=101). We obtained longitudinal data on disease-specific (dysphagia score, European Organisation for Reasearch and Treament of Cancer (EORTC) OES-23, visual analogue pain scale) and generic (EORTC Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnarie (QLQ-C30), Euroqol (EQ)-5D) HRQoL at monthly home visits by a specially-trained research nurse. We compared HRQoL between the two treatments and analysed changes in HRQoL during follow-up. Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy, but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy. For generic HRQoL, there was an overall significant difference in favour of brachytherapy on four out of five functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (role, emotional, cognitive and social) (P<0.05). Generic HRQoL deteriorated over time on all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and EQ-5D, in particular physical and role functioning (on average -23 and -24 on a 100 points scale during 0.5 years of follow-up). This decline was more pronounced in the stent group. Major improvements were seen on the dysphagia and eating scales of the EORTC OES-23, in contrast to other scales of this disease-specific measure, which remained almost stable during follow-up. Reported levels of chest or abdominal pain remained stable during follow-up in both treatment groups, general pain levels increased to a minor extent. The effects of single dose brachytherapy on HRQoL compared favourably to those of stent placement for the palliation of oesophageal cancer. Future studies on palliative care for oesophageal cancer should at least include generic HRQoL scales, since these were more responsive in measuring patients' functioning and well-being during follow-up than disease-specific HRQoL scales.

933,"Cutaneous metastases from neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix-An unusual metastatic lesion from an uncommon malignancy Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is an uncommon and aggressive type of small cell cervical cancer. NECs mostly arise from gastro-entero-pancreatic tract and the lung, but rarely from other organs like cervix. NEC of the cervix is a rare malignancy and constitutes 0.9%-1.5% of cervical tumors. NECs of cervix are common in perimenopausal females and present with abnormal vaginal bleeding and mimic squamous cell cancers, usually with no distinguishing features. On Immunohistochemistry, presence of chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD-56 is necessary to make a diagnosis of small cell carcinoma. These tumors are notorious for local as well as distant relapses in comparison to their squamous and adenocarcinoma counterpart. NECs are characterized by highly aggressive clinical behavior and carry a poor prognosis. They commonly metastases to lung, liver, brain, and bones even in early stages of the disease. Metastasis to skin is a rare occurrence. We herein report a case of a NEC of the uterine cervix with multiple cutaneous metastases. After the initial diagnosis of NEC of cervix, the patient received concurrent chemoradiation followed by intracavitary brachytherapy. On subsequent follow-up, the patient developed multiple cutaneous metastasis along with liver metastases. This case is reported in view of rarity of the case with skin metastases. To the best of our knowledge, only 3 cases of cutaneous metastases from NEC of the cervix are reported till date. Being a rare malignancy, evidence in the literature is in form of case reports and small case series. Thus, the optimal treatment strategy varies for these patients.

2470,"Hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown The vascular endothelial cell is believed to be a major target cell of radiation-induced injury to the central nervous system. Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier is associated with radiation-induced white matter lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. Adult rats were irradiated with graded single doses of 0-22 Gy to the cervical spinal cord. At various times up to 28 weeks after radiation, blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability was assessed using immunohistochemistry with antialbumin antibody and gamma counting of (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Hypoxia was assessed using two 2-nitroimidazole markers, [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise and 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-l-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3,-pentafluoropropyl) acetamide (EF5), with binding in the rat spinal cord measured using gamma counting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In the nonirradiated rat spinal cord, there was no evidence of BSCB disruption or VEGF expression. After 16-22 Gy, there was a dose-dependent increase in albumin staining and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid activity beginning at 16 weeks, consistent with barrier breakdown. A similar dose-dependent increase in white matter astrocytes that showed immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization signals for VEGF was observed. No increase in VEGF-positive cells was observed in gray matter. By 20 weeks after 20-22 Gy, animals developed white matter necrosis associated with diffuse albumin staining. Irradiated rat spinal cord showed a dose (16-22 Gy)- and time-dependent (16-20 weeks after 22 Gy) increase in [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise accumulation compared to nonirradiated controls. A similar pattern of dose- and time-dependent EF5 immunoreactivity was also observed in white matter. Areas of EF5 expression and VEGF in situ signals colocalized with areas of albumin immunoreactivity. It is concluded that there is a dose-dependent temporal and spatial association of hypoxia, VEGF up-regulation, and radiation-induced BSCB dysfunction. Hypoxia may provide the signal for VEGF up-regulation and perpetuate endothelial permeability damage in the central nervous system after ionizing radiation.",Included

Forty patients who have had NPC successfully treated by a single radical course of radiotherapy of 70-80 Gy were studied at 2-12 years (mean 6.2 years) after radiotherapy. Each patient was examined clinically and with a pure-tone audiogram. Averaged hearing thresholds over 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 kHz were evaluated and a value > 30 dB was considered abnormal. The findings were compared with age-matched controls. The median hearing threshold for each ear in NPC patients was found to be 31.9 dB (range 10.0-86.3 dB) and that for controls 17.5 dB (7.5-38.8 dB) (P < 0.0005, Wilcoxon's matched pairs test). In NPC patients, 44 ears (55.0%) had abnormal hearing, of which 17 (21.3%), 5 (6.3%) and 22 (27.5%) ears had predominantly sensori-neural, conductive and mixed hearing losses, respectively. Nineteen ears had middle ear effusions, accounting for the majority of mixed and conductive hearing losses. In terms of individual patients, 8 (20.0%) and 18 (45.0%) patients had abnormal hearing in one year (monaural hearing disability) and both ears (binaural hearing disability), respectively. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients who have had radiotherapy for NPC, have hearing disability in the long-term, as compared to normal controls.",Included

Prescription dose was 45 Gy. Target volumes were: gross tumor volume (GTV) = macroadenoma, clinical target volume (CTV) = GTV, and planning target volume = CTV + 0.5 cm. Structure contouring was performed by two radiation oncologists guided by an expert neuroradiologist.RESULTS: Five-field IMRT yielded significantly decreased temporal lobe dose delivery compared with 3D-CRT and 3F IMRT. Temporal lobe sparing with 5F IMRT was most pronounced at intermediate doses: mean V25Gy (% of total temporal lobe volume receiving >=25 Gy) of 13% vs. 28% vs. 29% for right temporal lobe and 14% vs. 29% vs. 30% for left temporal lobe for 5F IMRT, 3D-CRT, and 3F IMRT, respectively (p < 10(-7) for 5F IMRT vs. 3D-CRT and 5F IMRT vs. 3F IMRT). Five-field IMRT plans did not compromise target coverage, exceed normal tissue dose constraints, or increase estimated brain integral dose.CONCLUSIONS: Five-field IMRT irradiation technique results in a statistically significant decrease in the dose to the temporal lobes and may thus help prevent neurocognitive sequelae in irradiated pituitary macroadenoma patients.",Excluded
3295,"Mortality among pilots and cabin crew in Greece, 1990-1997 Background. Specific health hazards, among them radiation of cosmic origin, have caused some concern among aircrew in civil aviation in recent years. Several cohort studies in Northern countries have investigated mortality and cancer incidence among aircrew. Our goal was to study the pattern of mortality among Greek commercial airline cockpit and cabin crew. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study including 843 Olympic Airways cockpit crew and 1835 cabin attendants. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated based on death rates of the Greek population. Duration of employment as a proxy for occupational exposure was used to stratify the cohort. Results. For cockpit crew, the overall SMR was 0.7 (n = 65, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9). The SMR for all cancers was also significantly decreased (n = 17; SMR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Most of this reduction was due to a large deficit in lung cancer deaths (SMR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0-0.5). Slight but non-significant increases were noted for brain and liver cancer. The SMR for cardiovascular death was close to unity. Among female cabin attendants the SMR for all causes was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.4-1.3). The SMR for all cancers was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3-1.7). Mortality from breast cancer was not increased. Among male cabin crew, SMR for all causes was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Analyses according to duration of employment showed no pattern. Conclusions. In this first-ever occupational cohort study in Greece, Greek aircrew had a low overall and cancer mortality. Due to the small number of events, the strength of our study is limited. The Greek data will be included in a pooled analysis of European studies.",Included

2307,"The influence of fibroblast on the arachnoid leptomeningeal cells in vitro OBJECTIVE: Fibroblast is pervasive in the setting of injury. Its invasion into the arachnoid tissue causes scarring, cortical adhesion of the brain, and obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow. The purpose of this study is to determine the phenotypic and physiologic effects of fibroblasts on arachnoid in culture.METHODS: We studied the effects of fibroblast on the arachnoid cell growth, motility, phenotypic changes, and transport properties. Immortalized rat (Rattus norvegicus, Sprague Dawley breed) arachnoid cells were grown with fibroblast on opposite sides of polyethylene membranes or co-cultured in plastic wells. Arachnoid cell growth rate and DNA content, morphology, transport physiology, and extracellular matriceal content were determined in the presence of normal and irradiated fibroblast cells.RESULTS: When arachnoid cells were grown in the presence of fibroblasts, mannitol permeability increased and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) decreased. Arachnoid cell growth rate also significantly decreased. When arachnoid cells were grown in close proximity (i.e. on the same monolayer) with fibroblasts, the arachnoid cells were overrun by day 2, yet when physically separated, no significant change was seen in growth. Apoptosis increased markedly in arachnoid cultures in the presence of fibroblast. Fibroblast caused arachnoid cell to exhibit avoidance behavior, and irradiated fibroblast induced arachnoidal cells to move faster and exhibited greater directional changes. Subcellular glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content was significantly altered by fibroblast.INTERPRETATION: Fibroblasts influence arachnoid cell's mannitol transport likely via soluble factors. While the arachnoid cells did not change morphologically, cell growth was influenced. Over time, the cells had profound changes in transport and motility. The immortalized arachnoid cell/fibroblast culture system provides a unique model mimicking the pathologic event of leptomeningeal scarring.",Excluded

Two readers independently assessed the subjective image quality across multiple vascular segments on a Likert-like scale. Differences in contrast dose, CT dose index (CTDI), and dose length product (DLP) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Similarly, contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios (CNR and SNR) were compared in the mid-M1 MCA vessels bilaterally and the mid-basilar artery using Mann-Whitney U test. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the SNR/CNR values.RESULTS: Both observers showed excellent correlation in subjective image quality (mean percentage agreement of 95.2% for group 1 versus 89.2% for group 2). LD-CTA group showed better SNR and CNR (p < 0.0001) for both MCA vessels and the mid-basilar artery. Interclass correlation coefficient showed moderate correlation (0.51-0.63) between readers.

Immortalized, but untransformed human astrocytes failed even to establish growth on confluent normal human astrocytes. In contrast, all malignant human glioma cell lines and transformed human astrocytes demonstrated various degrees of infiltration into the astrocytic bed. Irradiation failed to alter the invasiveness of U87, A172, and U373. A 1-Gy dose slightly reduced the invasiveness of U251 MG by 75% (p < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Neuman-Keuls), without reducing total cell numbers. Independently irradiating the human astrocytic bed did not alter the invasiveness of nonirradiated U251, whereas the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001 reduced U251 invasiveness in the co-culture assay.CONCLUSIONS: Growth in the co-culture assay reflects the transformation status and provides a useful in vitro model for assessing invasiveness. Human glioma invasiveness in the co-culture model responds variably to single low-dose fractions. MMP activity promotes invasiveness in the co-culture model. Reduced invasiveness in irradiated U251 appears to be mediated by MMP-independent mechanisms.",Included
1785,"A case of paraplegia with piriformis syndrome. [Turkish, English] Apart from being a neuropathy developed by the compression and irritation of piriformis muscle on the sciatic nerve, piriformis syndrome (PS) can also be caused by a trigger point without sciatic nerve involvement. Although it has been reported that PS could be seen in individuals at all activity levels, PS in patients who had spinal cord injury (SCI) has not been reported. In this study, a case of paraplegia, suffering from hip pain, who had been diagnosed and treated as PS was presented. A 62 years old woman complaining about pain and numbness in low back and right hip was admitted to our clinic. She was mobilized by crutches. From her anamnesis it was understood that she developed paraplegia after a fall two years ago. In her physical examination, she was diagnosed as ASIA: D T3 incomplete paraplegia. Her complaints had started 6 months ago after falling on her right hip. She had a severe pain with radicular radiation, during the deep palpation of the piriformis muscle. Compression of lumbar spinous processes were slightly painful. While FAIR, Pace, Beatty tests were positive on the right side, straight leg raising and the Laseque tests were both negative. For the purpose of diagnosis and treatment, 4 cc of 2% lidocaine+1 cc of betametazon dipropionate injection with a 22 G 88 mm Spinocan was done under the guidance of ultrasound into the piriformis muscle. The patient was diagnosed as PS as there was a significant relief of symptoms after the injection. When the risk factors that can cause PS were questioned, we learned that she had a habit of eating on the floor and sitting with her legs crossed. The patient's activities of daily living were organized and medical treatment, lumbosacral orthosis and piriformis stretching exercises were given. It was observed that her complaints diminished gradually in 1st. and 3rd. months controls. In conclusion, while neuropathic pain below the level of neurologic injury often suggest central pain in patients with SCI, PS is a must to be considered in the differential diagnosis of hip pain especially in patients with incomplete SCI.",Excluded
2136,"Three-dimensional maxillary and mandibular regional superimposition using cone beam computed tomography: a validation study This study aimed to validate a novel method for fast regional superimposition of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans. The method can be used with smaller field of view scans, thereby allowing for a lower radiation dose. This retrospective study used two dry skulls and secondary data from 15 patients who had more than one scan taken using the same machine. Two observers tested two types of regional voxel-based superimposition: maxillary and mandibular. The registration took 10-15 s. Three-dimensional surface models of the maxillas and mandibles were generated via standardized threshold segmentation, and the accuracy and reproducibility of the superimpositions were assessed using the iterative closest point technique to measure the root mean square (RMS) distance between the images. Five areas were measured and a RMS <= 0.25 was considered successful. Descriptive statistics and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to compare the intra-observer measurement reproducibility. The ICC was >=0.980 for all of the variables and the highest RMS found was 0.241. The inter-observer reproducibility was assessed case by case and was perfect (RMS 0) for 68% (23 out of 34) of the superimpositions done and not clinically significant (RMS <= 0.25) for the other 32%. The method is fast, accurate, and reproducible and is an alternative to cranial base superimposition. Copyright Â© 2015 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded

The results are interpreted as indicating that the crystals had an elongated shape with an average thickness of T = 3.17 +/- 0. 15 nm in the caudal region and T = 3.79 +/- 0.20 nm in the cranial region. Their orientation was predominantly in the longitudinal direction of the bone. There was no preferential orientation within the transverse plane. The distribution of tilt angles with respect to the longitudinal direction was determined directly from the SAXS data: the average angle was about 30 degrees for the cranial region and 45 degrees for the caudal region. Assuming that the needle-like crystals are parallel with the collagen fibrils, the angular distribution of the crystals is in good agreement with previous measurements of collagen orientation using circularly polarized light microscopy.",Excluded
378,"ATM kinase inhibition preferentially sensitizes p53-mutant glioma to ionizing radiation PURPOSE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain cancer with a median survival of only 12 to 15 months. Current standard treatment consists of surgery followed by chemoradiation. The poor survival of patients with GBM is due to aggressive tumor invasiveness, an inability to remove all tumor tissue, and an innate tumor chemo- and radioresistance. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is an excellent target for radiosensitizing GBM because of its critical role in regulating the DNA damage response and p53, among other cellular processes. As a first step toward this goal, we recently showed that the novel ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019 reduced migration, invasion, and growth, and potently radiosensitized human glioma cells in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using orthotopic xenograft models of GBM, we now show that KU-60019 is also an effective radiosensitizer in vivo. Human glioma cells expressing reporter genes for monitoring tumor growth and dispersal were grown intracranially, and KU-60019 was administered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery or osmotic pump.RESULTS: Our results show that the combined effect of KU-60019 and radiation significantly increased survival of mice 2- to 3-fold over controls. Importantly, we show that glioma with mutant p53 is much more sensitive to KU-60019 radiosensitization than genetically matched wild-type glioma.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that an ATM kinase inhibitor may be an effective radiosensitizer and adjuvant therapy for patients with mutant p53 brain cancers.",Excluded
1638,"Regulation of neurite outgrowth by intermittent irradiation of visible light The effect of neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells on collagen-coated glass plates under intermittent light irradiation at 525 nm and 0.4 mW/cm2 of intensity was investigated. Neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was significantly suppressed when PC12 cells were cultivated under intermittent light irradiation with a total irradiation time of more than 2 min/h. No temperature increase was observed in the culture medium under either continuous or intermittent light irradiation. Therefore, suppression of neurite outgrowth under light irradiation was not due to the increase of temperature in the culture medium, but rather the effect of light on the PC12 cells, especially the signal transmittance of light to PC12 cells. The light irradiation interval also affected the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells when the total irradiation time was constant. A high extension ratio of neurite outgrowth was observed under a long time interval of nonirradiation between light irradiations (1 min of irradiation every hour) as compared with frequent light irradiation intervals (5 s of irradiation every 5 min) with the same total irradiation period per hour. The neurite outgrowth ratio was thought to be dependent on the light intensity, the total time of light irradiation in the intermittent light irradiation, and the interval of light irradiation in the intermittent light irradiation.",Excluded
738,"[Influence of low magnetic field on lipid peroxidation] UNLABELLED: Free radicals (FR) are atoms, molecules or their fragments, whose excess leads to the development of the oxidizing stress, which is the cause of many neoplasmic, neurodegenerative, inflammatory diseases and aging the organism. The main exogenous sources of free radicals are among others: industrial pollution, tobacco smoke, ionizing radiation, ultrasound and magnetic field. The low frequency magnetic field is more and more applied in the physician therapy. The aim of our study was to prove, if the magnetically field applied in the magntetotherapy, affects generating the reactive forms of oxygen according to its working time.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research material made up male, adult, Sprague-Dawley race rats age 3-4 months. To investigation compounds reacting with the tiobarbituric acid, the blood was taken from the rat caudal vein into the test-glass including EDTA before being affected by the magnetic field. After the single exposition and after 14 days of being affected by the magnetic field, the concentration of the compounds reacting with the tiobarbituric acid in the serum was measured.RESULTS: After the single exposition to the changeable magnetic field (frequency 40 Hz, induction 7 mT, working time 30' and 60 min) the process of the peroxidation of lipids slowed down. A increase of the peroxidation of lipids was observed after 14 days and these changes are statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Low magnetic field used in magnetotherapy causes the changes of the generating the reactive forms of oxygen.",Excluded

[Russian] For 24 h after total gamma-radiation of mature Wistar male rats (180-210 g) in the dose of 150 Gy, ultrastructural rearrangements of the cerebral sensomotor cortex are presented as small destructive changes in neurons, neuroglia and vascular endothelium. Total combination of the changes in ultrastructure of the blood capillaries and perivascular astrocytes makes it possible to suppose that permeability of the microvascular bed wall is increased. At this period, together with the destructive changes there are evidently certain compensatory-restorative processes, developing in the cerebral tissue. It is possible to suppose that already during the first hours after the radiation the ultrastructural changes of neurons are resulted not only from the direct effect of radiation, but from certain influences of the radiation damage of neuroglia and microvessels.",Included
2586,"Dosimetry to estimate the effect of Gelofusine on the renal absorbed dose of lutetium 177-DOTA-octreotate Introduction: Lutetium-177 DOTA-octreotate (LuTate), a radiolabelled somatostatin analogue, delivers targeted radiation to neuroendocrine tumours and metastases. Healthy tissues also receive significant irradiation. Charged amino acids are routinely co-infused to block renal proximal tubular LuTate reabsorption. Gelofusine (a succinylated bovine gelatin molecule), proposed to interact with the megalin/cubulin receptor-mediated transporter system, has been shown to reduce renal uptake of indium-111 octreotide. Routine Gelofusine administration is limited by risk of allergic reaction. Aim(s): To utilise personalised dosimetry to assess renal radiation risk from LuTate therapy and the additional effect of Gelofusine on renal absorbed dose of LuTate. Material(s) and Method(s): Quantitative SPECT images are routinely acquired following the first therapy cycle to estimate accumulated radiation doses delivered to kidneys. Five patients demonstrated a higher than threshold renal radiation dose and received additional renal protection with Gelofusine for future cycles of LuTate, with repeat dosimetry. Result(s): Gelofusine administration resulted in a mean reduction in renal absorbed biologically effective dose of 34% (range 12%-51%), with standard deviation of 19%. Conclusion(s): While administration of Gelofusine with LuTate therapy reduced renal absorbed radiation dose in all our patients, extent of reduction was quite variable.

2898,"Relationship between DNA double-strand break rejoining and cell survival after exposure to ionizing radiation in human fibroblast strains with differing ATM/p53 status: implications for evaluation of clinical radiosensitivity PURPOSE: To better understand the impact of defects in the DNA damage-surveillance network on the various cell-based assays used for the prediction of patient radiosensitivity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We examined noncancerous human fibroblast strains from individuals with ataxia telangiectasia (ataxia telangiectasia mutated [ATM] deficient) or Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53 deficient) using the neutral comet, H2AX phosphorylation, and clonogenic survival assays.RESULTS: Using the comet assay, we found that, compared with normal fibroblasts, cells lacking either ATM or p53 function exhibited a reduced rate of double-strand break (DSB) rejoining early (< or =4 h) after exposure to 8 Gy of gamma-radiation and also exhibited high levels of unrejoined DSBs later after irradiation. ATM-deficient and p53-deficient fibroblasts also exhibited abnormally increased levels of phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX) at later intervals after irradiation. In the clonogenic assay, ATM-deficient cells exhibited marked radiosensitivity and p53-deficient cells had varying degrees of radioresistance compared with normal fibroblasts.CONCLUSION: Regardless of whether ataxia telangiectasia and Li-Fraumeni syndrome fibroblasts are DSB-repair deficient per se, it is apparent that p53 and ATM defects greatly influence the cellular phenotype as evidenced by the neutral comet and gamma-H2AX assays. Our data suggest that the gamma-H2AX levels observed at later intervals after irradiation may represent a reliable measure of the overall DSB rejoining capabilities of human fibroblasts. However, it appears that using this parameter as a predictor of radiosensitivity without knowledge of the cells' p53 status could lead to incorrect conclusions.",Excluded
1824,"Clinical and pathological characteristics of brain metastasis resected after failed radiosurgery OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the tumor histopathology and clinical characteristics of patients who underwent resection of their brain metastasis after failed gamma knife radiosurgery.METHODS: This study was a retrospective review from a prospective database. A total of 1200 brain metastases in 912 patients were treated by gamma knife radiosurgery during a 7-year period. Fifteen patients (1.6% of patients, 1.2% of all brain metastases) underwent resective surgery for either presumed tumor progression (6 patients) or worsening neurological symptoms associated with increased mass effect (9 patients). Radiographic imaging, radiosurgical and surgical treatment parameters, histopathological findings, and long-term outcomes were reviewed for all patients.RESULTS: The mean age at the time of radiosurgery was 57 years (age range, 32-65 years). Initial pathological diagnoses included metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma in 8 patients (53%), melanoma in 4 patients (27%), renal cell carcinoma in 2 patients (13%), and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in 1 patient (7%). The mean time interval between radiosurgery and surgical extirpation was 8.5 months (range, 3 weeks to 34 months). The mean treatment volume for the resected lesion at the time of radiosurgery was 4.4 cm(3) (range, 0.6-8.4 cm(3)). The mean dose to the tumor margin was 21Gy (range, 18-24 Gy). In addition to the 15 tumors that were eventually resected, a total of 32 other metastases were treated synchronously, with a 78% control rate. The mean volume immediately before surgery for the 15 resected lesions was 7.5 cm(3) (range, 3.8-10.2 cm(3)). Histological findings after radiosurgery varied from case to case and included viable tumor, necrotic tumor, vascular hyalinization, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, reactive gliosis in surrounding brain tissue, and an elevated MIB-1 proliferation index in cases with viable tumor. The mean survival for patients in whom viable tumor was identified (9.4 months) was significantly lower than that of patients in whom only necrosis was seen (15.1 months; Fisher's exact test, P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Radiation necrosis and tumor radioresistance are the most common causes precipitating a need for surgical resection after radiosurgery in patients with brain metastasis.",Excluded
591,"Magnetic-resonance imaging for kinetic analysis of permeability changes during focused ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening and brain drug delivery Focused ultrasound (FUS) with the presence of microbubbles has been shown to induce transient and local opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the delivery of therapeutic molecules which normally cannot penetrate into the brain. The success of FUS brain-drug delivery relies on its integration with in-vivo imaging to monitor kinetic change of therapeutic molecules into the brain. In this study, we developed a dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) technique for kinetic analysis of delivered molecules during FUS-BBB opening. Three kinetic parameters (K<inf>trans</inf>, V<inf>e</inf>, K<inf>ep</inf>) were characterized dynamically to describe BBB-permeability at two FUS exposure conditions (0.4 or 0.8 MPa) over 24 h. K<inf>trans</inf>, defined as the influx volume transfer constant from plasma to EES, and V<inf>e</inf>, the EES volume fraction, were both found to be pressure-dependent. K<inf>trans</inf> and V<inf>e</inf> showed a peak increase of 0.0086-0.0131 min<sup>- 1</sup> (for 0.4-0.8 MPa pressure), and 0.0431-0.0692, respectively, immediately after FUS exposure. Both parameters subsequently decreased exponentially as a function of time, with estimated half-lives of decay of 2.89-5.3 and 2.2-4.93 h, respectively. The kinetics of K<inf>ep</inf>, defined as the efflux rate constant from the extracellular extravascular space (EES) to the plasma, were complementary to K <inf>trans</inf>, with an initial decrease from 0.2010 to 0.1901 min <sup>- 1</sup> followed by a significantly longer recovery time (half-life of 17.39-99.92 h). Our observations strongly supported the existence of imbalanced and mismatched kinetics of influx (K<inf>trans</inf>) and efflux (K <inf>ep</inf>) between the plasma and EES, indicating the existence of directional permeability during FUS-BBB opening. We further showed that kinetic change determined by DCE-MRI correlated well with the concentration of Evans Blue (EB)-albumin (coefficient of 0.74-0.89). These findings suggest that MRI kinetic monitoring may serve as an alternative method for in-vivo monitoring of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) change of therapeutic agents during drug delivery to the brain, and provide useful information for future optimization of FUS-BBB opening.

2038,"PAK4 governs radiation-induced endothelial GRO-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling and angiogenesis in glioma Aberrant neovascularization is a pathological hallmark of glioblastoma that correlates with poor clinical outcome. Factors that drive endothelial proliferation, recruitment into the tumor and angiogenesis in the context of radiotherapy are potentially novel therapeutic targets for glioma. Our studies showed high expression of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in gliomas; analyses of conditioned medium (CM) prepared from shRNA-mediated PAK4-knockdown (PAK4.sh) glioma cells using a human angiogenesis array showed a significant downregulation in key angiogenic factors including Gro-1alpha. Treatment of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) with CM from PAK4.sh-cells significantly inhibited endothelial proliferation, migration and microtubule formation compared with controls. PAK4.sh-CM treatment also suppressed CXCR2 receptor activation and decreased the expression levels of p-Stat3, MMP-2 and cyclin D1 in HBMECs. Ionizing radiation (IR, 8 Gy) activated Gro-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling in HBMECs, and induced high levels of endothelial capillary network formation on matrigel. On the other hand, PAK4.sh inhibited IR-induced angiogenesis by decreasing Gro-1alpha and CXCR2 levels in HBMECS. Further, in vivo experiments with orthotopic intracranial tumors in nude mice showed growth suppression in PAK4.sh tumors compared to control tumors. Immunohistochemical analyses of brain tumor sections showed a significant decrease in MMP-2 in PAK4.sh tumors. In summary, our studies emphasize a novel role of PAK4 as a critical mediator of tumor-endothelial cell interactions via Gro-1alpha-CXCR2signaling, and in vivo tumor growth suppression by PAK4 depletion indicates its therapeutic potential in the treatment of glioma.",Included

Our group has previously shown that human GRM1 (hGRM1) expressing melanoma cells release excess extracellular glutamate and are growth inhibited by riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release. Riluzole-treated cells accumulate in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle at 24 hours, and then undergo apoptotic cell death. We evaluated whether riluzole enhanced radiosensitivity in melanoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clonogenic assays were performed to evaluate clonogenic survival after treatment in hGRM1 expressing and nonexpressing melanoma cells. Western immunoblots were performed to confirm apoptotic cell death. A xenograft mouse model was used to validate the in vitro experiments. Tumors harvested from the xenografts were fixed and stained for apoptosis and DNA damage markers.RESULTS: In the hGRM1-positive cell lines C8161 and UACC903, riluzole enhanced the lethal effects of ionizing radiation; no difference was seen in the hGRM1-negative UACC930 cell line. C8161 cells treated with riluzole plus irradiation also showed the highest levels of the cleaved forms of PARP and caspase-3; excised C8161 xenografts showed the greatest number of apoptotic cells by immunohistochemistry (P < 0.001). On cell cycle analysis, a sequence-dependent enrichment in the G(2)/M phase was shown with the combination of riluzole and irradiation. Xenografts treated with riluzole and weekly radiation fractions showed significant growth inhibition and revealed markedly increased DNA damage.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown, in vitro and in vivo, that the combination of riluzole and ionizing radiation leads to greater cytotoxicity.

Febrile neutropenia tended to occur frequently in the complication (+) group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that skeletal muscle loss was the only factor significantly associated with infectious complications (p = 0.029). Among adverse events, febrile neutropenia was significantly associated with a decrease in skeletal muscle mass.CONCLUSION: Loss of skeletal muscle mass during NACT was a significant risk factor for postoperative infectious complications in patients with esophageal cancer.

The use of SRS is expanding for patients with multiple (>4) brain metastases (BM). This study summarizes our institutional experience with single-fraction, linear-accelerator-based SRS for multiple BM. Methods and materials All patients who were treated between January 1, 2013, and September 30, 2015, with single-fraction SRS for >=4 BM were included in this institutional review board-approved, retrospective, single-institution study. Patients were treated with linear accelerator-based image guided SRS. Results A total of 59 patients with >=4 BM were treated with single-fraction SRS. The median follow-up was 15.2 months, and the median overall survival for the entire cohort was 5.8 months. The median number of treated lesions per patient was 5 (range, 4-23). Per patient, the median planning target volume (PTV) was 4.8 cc (range, 0.7-28.8 cc). The prescribed dose across all 380 BM for the 59 patients ranged from 7 to 20 Gy. The median of the mean dose to the total PTV was 19.5 Gy. Although the number of treated lesions (4-5 vs >=6) did not influence survival, better survival was noted for a total PTV <10 cc versus >=10 cc (7.1 vs 4.2 months, respectively; P =.0001). A mean dose of >=19 Gy to the entire PTV was also associated with increased survival (6.6 vs 5.0 months, respectively; P =.0172). Patients receiving a dose of >12 Gy to >=10 cc of normal brain had worse survival (5.1 vs 8.6 months, respectively; P =.0028). Conclusion In single-fraction SRS for patients with multiple BM, smaller total tumor volume, higher total dose, and lower volume of normal brain receiving >12 Gy were associated with increased survival. These data suggest that using SRS for the treatment of multiple BM is efficacious and that outcomes may be affected more by total tumor volume than by the number of lesions.

1770,"Detection of misery perfusion with split-dose <sup>123</sup>I-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with carotid occlusive diseases Background and Purpose - Patients with carotid occlusive disease and stage 2 cerebral hemodynamic failure, characterized by an increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and otherwise known as misery perfusion, have a high risk of cerebral ischemia and subsequent stroke. In clinical practice, the detection of patients with misery perfusion through the use of widely available, noninvasive, and cost-effective modalities such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is extremely important. Methods - We evaluated the relationships between the regional hemodynamic status of cerebral circulation, measured with split-dose [<sup>123</sup>I] N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine SPECT (<sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT) and an acetazolamide challenge, and hemodynamic parameters, including OEF measured with PET, in 27 patients with both unilateral and bilateral carotid occlusive diseases. Results - A significant negative correlation was found between the SPECT-measured cerebrovascular reserve after acetazolamide administration and both the PET-measured OEF and cerebral blood volume. Neither the cerebrovascular reserve nor the cerebral blood flow index, when expressed as a SPECT-measured cerebrum-to-cerebellum ratio, was useful for detecting lesions with an elevated OEF. However, a combination of the cerebrovascular reserve and cerebral blood flow index showed high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the detection of misery perfusion. Conclusions - Our study suggests that split-dose <sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT with an acetazolamide challenge could be useful for screening patients with misery perfusion in carotid occlusive diseases.",Excluded

1842,"The cyberknife as a perfect tool for new therapeutic challenges in radiotherapy. [French] The ""wholy grale"" in radiotherapy is the search for a treatment as conformal as possible allowing to apply very high doses on the target while leaving healthy tissues as much as possible outside the prescription isodose. Radiotherapy is characterized by a never ending technical evolution aiming at increasing biological efficacy on the target while reducing toxicity at the level of the surrounding organs at risk. One of the by-products of this ever lasting quest to precision and dose concentration is the concept of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions. For a long time the technique has only been available for cranial non-moving targets, as high precision and moving targets have long been considered antinomic for technical reasons. The clinical need to apply these same concepts for extra-cranial locations, potentially suitable to move during the irradiations, has been a booster to develop informatics and robotics. The result of these technical developments is the CyberKnife. We intend to present this technique and highlight the experience of more than two years of clinical use in the department of radiotherapy in the University Hospital of Liege. The various indications of stereotactic radiotherapy with CyberKnife will be reviewed.",Excluded
186,"Single-center experience with glass-based Yttrium 90 embolization in neuroendocrine liver metastases Purpose: To evaluate glass-based Yttrium 90 (Y90) radioembolization in management of neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Specifically to assess toxicities and short-term imaging response. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective review of all patients who had neuroendocrine metastases to the liver that underwent radioembolization with Y-90 was performed. Electronic patient charts were reviewed to analyze demographics, radiation dosimetry, clinical findings, laboratory data, and imaging findings. Toxicities and side effects reported during the first 3 months of the procedures were identified from clinical notes. Short-term imaging response was assessed using EASL and modified RECIST criteria by reviewing latest imaging study in comparison with pre-treatment studies. Result(s): A total of 48 patients received 88 radioembolizations between December 2009 and May 2011. 34 patients had adequate follow-up. A total of 60 lobar and segmental radioembolizations were performed in 34 patients. There were 18 males and 16 females with a median age of 61 y/o (43 to 80 y/o). The radiation dose ranged from 74.9 Gy to 347.1 Gy with an average of 150.9 Gy. 22 patients (65%) complained of fatigue. 15 (44%) right-sided abdominal pain and 8 (24%) noted weight loss ranging from 3.5 kg to 11kg. Seven (21%) patients had nausea, but none experienced vomiting. There was no mortality. Response assessment was made per each lobe/ segment treated and average duration for follow-up was 8 months. There were 82.0 % partial response, 10.3 % stable disease, and 7.7 % progression. Conclusion(s): Glass-based Y90 radioembolization has low toxicity and good imaging response in management of NET metastases to liver.",Excluded
957,"Hemorrhage of cerebral arteriovenous malformations significantly alters stereotactic radiosurgery outcomes Introduction: Intracranial hemorrhage is simultaneously the most frequent and most debilitating manifestation of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM), but its impact on success and complications of radiosurgery has not been rigorously assessed. In this case-control study, we define the effect of prior hemorrhage on AVM radiosurgery outcomes. Method(s): From a prospective, institutional database of 1400 AVM patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, unruptured and ruptured AVMs were matched in a 1:1 fashion, blinded to outcome, based on patient demographics, prior embolization, AVM size (mean volume of unruptured AVMs 3.7 cm3 versus ruptured AVMs 3.5 cm3, P=0.195), Spetzler-Martin grade and radiosurgical treatment parameters (mean prescription dose for unruptured AVMs 20.9 Gy versus ruptured AVMs 21.0 Gy, P=0.837). There were 270 patients in each cohort. Matched statistical analyses were used to compare the baseline characteristics, obliteration rates, post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage risks, and incidences of radiation-induced changes (RIC) between the two cohorts. Result(s): The actuarial obliteration rates of the two cohorts were similar (unruptured AVMs: 38%, 58%, 76% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 40%, 60%, 73% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.592). However, for embolized AVMs, complete obliteration was more likely to be achieved in unruptured lesions (unruptured AVMs: 25%, 32%, 54% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 18%, 27%, 42% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.038). Prior AVM rupture resulted in a higher annual risk of post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage (ruptured AVMs 2.3% versus unruptured AVMs 1.1%, P=0.025) but a lower rate of cumulative and symptomatic RIC (cumulative RIC: ruptured AVMs 30.4% versus unruptured AVMs 48.9%, P<0.0001; symptomatic RIC: ruptured AVMs 7.0% versus unruptured AVMs 12.2%, P=0.041, respectively). The rates of permanent RIC were similar between the unruptured (2.2%) and ruptured (1.9%) AVM cohorts (P=0.761). Conclusion(s): Prior AVM rupture significantly alters the risk of latency period hemorrhage and RIC following radiosurgery. These effects should be taken into consideration with the multidisciplinary management of AVM patients.",Excluded
1791,"A new UV-sensitive mutant that suggests a second excision repair pathway in Neurospora crassa In an attempt to understand the relationship between photorepair and dark repair in Neurospora crassa, a new mutant was isolated, which showed defects in both repair processes. The new mutant, mus-38, is moderately sensitive to UV and shows imperfect photoreactivation following UV irradiation. DNA was purified from this mutant and the other UV-sensitive mutants, and analyzed for the removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). UV-specific endonuclease-sensitive sites (ESS) completely disappeared with 1 h of photoreactivation in mus-38 DNA, although the survival recovery with photoreactivation was greatly reduced in this mutant. This suggests that the insufficient survival recovery with photoreactivation in mus-38 does not result from a failure of photo-reversal of CPDs. Removal of ESS during liquid holding (dark repair) was slower in mus-38 compared to wild type. To test the possibility that this mutant was involved in excision repair, the double mutant was made between mus-38 and mus-18, which encodes a UV-damage-specific endonuclease. CPD excision in the mus-18 null mutant was severely affected but not completely inhibited. The double mutant showed a complete loss of the excision activity and was super sensitive to UV. These results indicate that mus-38 participates in an excision pathway that is different from the mus-18 pathway. The mus-38 mutant was sensitive not only to UV but also to some chemical mutagens which make adducts on DNA. Thus, mus-38 is possibly involved in an excision-repair pathway that is related to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 pathway. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded

An additional lesion in one of these cats displayed high signal on T2-weighted images and enhanced on T1-weighted images after IV gadolinium-DTPA. Pathologic correlation revealed that the nonenhancing T2-weighted lesions consisted of edema or demyelinated regions without inflammation while the gadolinium-enhanced lesion demonstrated necrosis with inflammatory infiltrate.

2028,"Analysis of the feeding motor pattern in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis: photoinactivation of axonally stained pattern-generating interneurons We have photoinactivated identified feeding interneurons known as N1 and N2 neurons. These are pattern-generating neurons that are active in the protraction of the radula and rasping phases, respectively, of the feeding cycle of the pond snail. The N1 or N2 feeding interneurons in the buccal ganglia were filled with the fluorescent dye 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF) from the cut end of the nerve that contains their axon. Filling the cerebrobuccal connective (N = 151) stained just one N1 cell in the contralateral buccal ganglion. Filling the postbuccal nerve stained neurons symmetrically in both buccal ganglia (N = 75): only one labeled cell in each ganglion is an N2 interneuron. The feeding rhythm was evoked by depolarizing a modulatory neuron, the SO, located in the buccal ganglia. The axonally filled N1 interneuron was irradiated at its axon in the buccal commissure with blue laser light (intensity of 0.5 MW.m-2). Irradiation of just one N1 completely blocked the feeding rhythm (seven preparations). In seven further preparations, N1 ablation slowed the SO-driven feeding rhythm and weakened the N1 input to the feeding neurons. Irradiation of the cell bodies of both the filled left and right N2 interneurons killed the cells but did not produce any consistent change in the feeding rate (15 preparations). The feeding interneurons and motoneurons still showed the characteristic N2 phase synaptic inputs, so more, as yet unidentified, N2 neurons must be located in other parts of the buccal ganglia. We conclude that the participation of the identified N1 interneurons is essential for the normal feeding pattern while other, still to be identified N2 neurons must be present and must contribute to the feeding rhythm. We suggest that the extra redundancy of the N2 network may be related to the greater necessity of sensory feedback control during rasping than during protraction of the radula.",Excluded

A chest wall structure was retrospectively defined on planning scans, and chest wall dosimetry and tumour-related factors recorded. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors predictive of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain.RESULTS: 182 patients and 187 tumours were included. There were 20 (10.9%) episodes of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that the maximum dose received by 1 cm(3) of chest wall (Dmax1 cm(3)) and tumour size were significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain [Dmax1 cm(3) odds ratio : 1.104, 95% confidence interval : 1.012-1.204, p = 0.025; tumour size (mm) odds ratio : 1.080, 95% confidence interval : 1.026-1.136, p = 0.003]. This model was an adequate fit to the data (Hosmer and Lemeshow test non-significant) and a fair discriminator for chest wall pain (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.74). Using the multivariate logistic regression model, parameters for Dmax1 cm(3) are provided, which predict <10% and <20% risks of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain for different tumour sizes.CONCLUSION: Grade 2+ chest wall pain is an uncommon side effect of lung SABR. Larger tumour size and increasing Dmax1 cm(3) are significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. When planning lung SABR, it is prudent to try to avoid hot volumes in the chest wall, particularly for larger tumours.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article demonstrates that Grade 2 or greater chest wall pain following lung SABR is more common when the tumour is larger in size and the Dmax1 cm(3) of the chest wall is higher. When planning lung SABR, the risk of chest wall pain may be reduced if maximum doses are minimized, particularly for larger tumours.",Excluded

This work develops and investigates a comprehensive formalism for accurate motion-compensated reconstruction which at the same time is very feasible in the context of high-resolution PET. In particular, this paper proposes an effective method to incorporate presence of scattered and random coincidences in the context of motion (which is similarly applicable to various other motion correction schemes). The overall reconstruction framework takes into consideration missing projection data which are not detected due to motion, and additionally, incorporates information from all detected events, including those which fall outside the field-of-view following motion correction.

This information about nigro-striatal and sympathetic cardiac neuronal loss may contribute to the early diagnosis of PD and provide relevant elements for differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndrome. The main limitation to investigate these different neuronal systems, is related to the need of two scans, with two tracers and double radiation exposure for patients. <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA is a dopamine precursor able to evaluate synthetic and storage capacity of dopamine in pre-synaptic terminals. This PET radiopharmaceutical is a sensitive bio-marker to assess nigro-striatal dysfunction and its diagnostic accuracy is comparable to those of <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT. However, <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA has never been validate so far as a biomarker of cardiac sympathetic denervation, despite its cardiac uptake. Our aim is evaluating the association between cardiac and striatal <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA uptake in de novo PD, in order to test whether it may be further evaluated as a biomarker of cardiac neuronal loss. Methods Sixteen patients with de novo PD were included in this study. Patients with history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. The patients were given carbidopa (2,5 mg/Kg) orally, and after 60 min, received 185 MBq of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA. PET/CT was acquired 90 min after the injection. Cardiac <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA-PET/CT was acquired at the end of brain scan. Automatic segmentation and semiquantification of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA striatal uptake was asses using basal ganglia matching tools package. Regions of interest were drawn over the heart and mediastinum. The ratio between the uptake in the left ventricle and mediastinum (H/M ratio) was recorded for each scan. Results Both in case of putamen (r=0.75, p=0.0009) and caudate (r=0.57, p=0.02) , a significant correlation between the more affected site of striatal uptake and H/M ratio was found. Direct correlation between striatal uptake and H/M ratio was confirmed also in the controlateral site (putamen: r=0.63, p= 0.0096; caudate: r=0.54, p=0.03). No significant inverse correlation was found between UPDRS III and H/M ratio (r=- 0.3630, p= 0.16). Conclusion These findings support the hypothesis that cardiac 18FDOPA uptake may be used as a biomarker of cardiac neuronal loss. If they were confirmed, it will be feasible to image striatal and cardiac pre-synaptic monoaminergic function with a single radiopharmaceutical, dual acquisition, and PET/CT resolution, thus sparing radiation exposure and costs.",Excluded
2145,"Localization of glutathione and induction of glutathione synthesis-related proteins in mouse brain by low doses of gamma-rays First, we determined the cerebral localization of reduced glutathione (GSH) in normal mice by means of autoradiography using 99mTc-meso-hexamethyl propylene oxime. A highly specific localization of GSH in the cerebellum and hippocampus was observed. Secondly, we measured the elevation of GSH level in the brain after low-dose gamma-irradiation. The cerebral GSH levels increased soon after irradiation with 50 cGy of gamma-rays, reaching a maximum at 3 h post-treatment, then remaining significantly higher than that of the non-irradiated control until 12 h and returning to the control level by 24 h. Thirdly, we examined the induction of the activities and the mRNAs of proteins involved in the synthesis and regeneration of GSH in the brain of mice subjected to low-dose gamma-ray irradiation. The level of mRNA for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase was significantly increased at 0.5 h, and remained high until 2 h post-irradiation (50 cGy). The level was transiently lowered to the non-irradiated control level at 3 h and slightly increased again after 6 h post-irradiation. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was significantly increased 3 h after irradiation, and remained high up to 24 h post-irradiation. As for glutathione reductase, the mRNA level was increased at 0.5 h, and peaked strongly at 2 h, while the enzyme activity was significantly increased at 6 h after irradiation, and continued to increase up to 24 h. The level of mRNA for thioredoxin, which contributes to GSH biosynthesis by supplying cysteine to the de novo pathway, peaked between 0.5 h and 2 h post-irradiation, and rapidly declined thereafter. The content of thioredoxin showed a transient decrease immediately after irradiation, but was then remarkably elevated, reaching a maximum at 3 h, and thereafter declining sharply. These results indicate that the increase in endogenous GSH in mouse brain soon after low-dose gamma-ray irradiation is a consequence of the induction of GSH synthesis-related proteins and occurs via both the de novo synthesis and the regeneration pathways.",Included
1987,"Study of antioxidative effects and anti-inflammatory effects in mice due to low-dose X-irradiation or radon inhalation Low-dose irradiation induces various stimulating effects, especially activation of the biological defense system including antioxidative and immune functions. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause cell damage and death and can induce many types of diseases. This paper reviews new insights into inhibition of ROS-related diseases with low-dose irradiation or radon inhalation. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before or after carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment inhibits hepatopathy in mice. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before ischemia-reperfusion injury or cold-induced brain injury also inhibits edema. These findings suggest that low-dose X-irradiation has antioxidative effects due to blocking the damage induced by free radicals or ROS. Moreover, radon inhalation increases superoxide dismutase activity in many organs and inhibits CCl4-induced hepatic and renal damage and streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes. These findings suggest that radon inhalation also has antioxidative effects. This antioxidative effect against CCl4-induced hepatopathy is comparable to treatment with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) at a dose of 500 mg/kg weight, or alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) treatment at a dose of 300 mg/kg weight, and is due to activation of antioxidative functions. In addition, radon inhalation inhibits carrageenan-induced inflammatory paw edema, suggesting that radon inhalation has anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, radon inhalation inhibits formalin-induced inflammatory pain and chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, suggesting that radon inhalation relieves pain. Thus, low-dose irradiation very likely activates the defense systems in the body, and therefore, contributes to preventing or reducing ROS-related injuries, which are thought to involve peroxidation.",Included

1928,"Localization dependent sensitivity of cerebral Na,K-ATPase to irradiation induced oxidative imbalance in rats Na,K-ATPase represents the key enzyme maintaining the ionic gradient across plasma membrane. It was documented that in directly irradiated organs the activity of this enzyme is decreased. The aim of present study was to clarify the remote effect of irradiation in mediastinal area on the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in selected brain regions in rats. Ionizing radiation in single dose 25 Gy induced alterations in oxidative status of blood plasma. Irradiation also decreased the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in cerebral cortex. Measurements of kinetic properties of the enzyme dependently on the concentration of energy substrate ATP or cofactor Na<sup>+</sup> indicated that the lowered enzyme activity is probably a consequence of decreased number of active molecules of the enzyme, as suggested by lowered V<sub>max</sub> values (by 13 - 14%). Immunoblot analysis revealed that this effect is connected namely to decreased presence of alpha2 and alpha3 subunits (by 25% and 30% respectively). Considering the current concepts about involvement of the malfunction of alpha2 alpha3 subunits in development of primary brain dysfunctions, it may be hypothesized that the lowered functionality of those subunits of Na,K-ATPase may represent a predisposition to neurodegenerative disorders after irradiation. The observed effect seems to be localization dependent as the enzyme in cerebellum resisted to irradiation.",Included

3474,"Transcription coupled repair deficiency results in increased chromosomal aberrations and apoptotic death in the UV61 cell line, the Chinese hamster homologue of Cockayne's syndrome B Transcription coupled repair (TCR), a special sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), removes transcription blocking lesions rapidly from the transcribing strand of active genes. In this study, we have evaluated the importance of the TCR pathway in the induction of chromosomal aberrations and apoptosis in isogenic Chinese hamster cell lines, which differ in TCR efficiency. AA8 is the parental cell line, which is proficient in the genome overall repair of UV-C radiation induced 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP) and the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) from the transcribing strand of active genes. UV61 cells (hamster homologue of human Cockayne's syndrome (CS) group B cells) originally isolated from AA8, exhibit proficient repair of 6-4 PP but are deficient in CPD removal by the TCR pathway. Upon UV-C irradiation of cells in G1-phase, UV61 showed a dramatic increase in apoptotic response as compared to AA8 cells. Abolition of TCR by treatment with alpha-amanitin (an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II) in AA8 cells also resulted in an elevated apoptotic response like that observed in UV61 cells treated with UV alone. This suggests that the lack of TCR is largely responsible for increased apoptotic response in UV61 cells. Furthermore, the chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induced by UV were also found to be higher in UV61 cells than in TCR proficient AA8 cells. This study shows that the increased chromosomal aberrations and apoptotic death in UV61 cells is due to their inability to remove CPD from the transcribing strand of active genes and suggests a protective role for TCR in the prevention of both chromosomal aberrations and apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis and time-course appearance of apoptotic cells suggest that the conversion of UV-DNA damage into chromosomal aberrations precedes and determines the apoptotic process.",Excluded
1401,"Weiss Lecture. Effects of radiations of different qualities on cells: molecular mechanisms of damage and repair Studies of ionizing radiations of different quality are discussed with particular emphasis on damage to DNA of mammalian cells. Three related themes are followed. Firstly, inactivation and mutation experiments with ultrasoft X-rays and slow heavy ions, coupled with theoretical analyses of the structures of the radiation tracks, have emphasized the biological importance of localized track features over nanometre dimensions. This led to the suggestion that the critical physical features of the tracks are the stochastic clusterings of ionizations, directly in or very near to DNA, resulting in clustered initial molecular damage including various combinations of breaks, base damages, cross-links, etc. in the DNA. The quantitative hypotheses imply that final cellular effects from high-LET radiations are dominated by their more severe, and therefore less repairable, clustered damage, and that these are qualitatively different from the dominant low-LET damage. Second, relative effectiveness of different types of radiation led to questions on the mechanisms of induction of chromosome exchanges. The high efficiency of ultrasoft X-rays, despite their very short track lengths, suggested that single sites of DNA damage may lead to exchanges by a molecular process involving interaction with undamaged DNA. Also it is shown that a single site-specific DNA break, introduced by restriction enzymes, sometimes leads to a large deletion when misrepaired by cell extracts. These deletions occur between short DNA repeats, and are therefore a form of 'illegitimate' recombination, but clearly do not involve the interaction of two damage sites. Third, it was shown that cells from patients with the radiosensitive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) lack a post-irradiation recovery process. The sensitivity of AT cells to high LET radiations was found to be reduced relative to that for normal cells, reinforcing the concept that high LET damage is less easy to repair. AT patients are prone to lymphoreticular cancers, and their cells show characteristic chromosomal rearrangements, which may be associated with misrepair at specific genomic sequences. Similarly, studies of radiation-induced leukaemia in the mouse have implicated rearrangement at specific interstitial chromosome sites, which are rich in telomere-like repeat sequences.

This new paradigm, involving inputs from different sensory systems, allows quantification of several critical parameters, like orientation performance, walking velocities and postural stability, in a natural walking task. The paper presented here mainly focuses on spatial orientation performance quantified by the errors in walking the previously seen path without vision. Errors in length and reaching the corners did not change significantly from pre- to post-flight, while absolute angular errors slightly increased post-flight. The significant decrease in walking velocity and a change in head-trunk coordination while walking around the corners of the path observed post-flight may suggest that during re-adaptation to gravity the mechanisms which are necessary to perform the task have to be re-accomplished.",Excluded

2262,"The effects on basal anterior pituitary hormone concentrations by cranial irradiation in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Hypopituitarism occurring in patients who received external cranial radiation therapy (RT) have been increasingly recognized. Fourteen healthy patients were collected as control Group I, and 25 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were enrolled as Group II. Another 18 NPC patients were enrolled as Group III. Blood was sampled from Group I, Group IIB (before RT), Group IIA (one week after RT) and Group IIIA (1 to 1.5 years after RT). The basal samples were taken for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), thyrotropin (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). The results showed the T3 level was statistically low in Group IIB compared with Group I. The serum GH and FSH (male only) levels were higher and with statistical significance in Group IIA compared Group IIB. Both GH and ACTH levels decreased and PRL increased with statistical significance in Group IIIA compared with Group IIA. The ACTH decreased with statistical significance in Group IIIA compared with Group IIB. Clinical damage to the pituitary is usually manifested months to years after RT. Therefore, a careful exclusion of these glands from radiation treatment fields is recommended whenever possible.",Included
2673,"Space radiation-induced inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and memory impairment in mice: ameliorative potential of the melatonin metabolite, AFMK Evaluation of potential health effects from high energy charged particle radiation exposure during long duration space travel is important for the future of manned missions. Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. The present study reports on the protective effects of N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a melatonin metabolite, against high energy charged particle radiation-induced oxidative damage to the brain. We observed that radiation exposure (2.0 Gy of 500 MeV/nucleon (56)Fe beams, a ground-based model of space radiation) impaired the spatial memory of mice at later intervals without affecting the motor activities. AFMK pretreatment significantly ameliorated these neurobehavioral ailments. Radiation-induced changes in the population of immature and proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus were localized using anti-doublecortin (Dcx) and anti-Ki-67 expression. AFMK pretreatment significantly inhibited the loss of Dcx and Ki-67 positive cells. Moreover, AFMK pretreatment ameliorated the radiation-induced augmentation of protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde (MDA + HAE) in the brain and maintained the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and nonprotein sulfhydryl contents in brain.",Included

2538,"Preclinical radiotherapy at the Australian Synchrotron's Imaging and Medical Beamline: instrumentation, dosimetry and a small-animal feasibility study Therapeutic applications of synchrotron X-rays such as microbeam (MRT) and minibeam (MBRT) radiation therapy promise significant advantages over conventional clinical techniques for some diseases if successfully transferred to clinical practice. Preclinical studies show clear evidence that a number of normal tissues in animal models display a tolerance to much higher doses from MRT compared with conventional radiotherapy. However, a wide spread in the parameters studied makes it difficult to make any conclusions about the associated tumour control or normal tissue complication probabilities. To facilitate more systematic and reproducible preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies, a dedicated preclinical station including small-animal irradiation stage was designed and installed at the Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) at the Australian Synchrotron. The stage was characterized in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the vertical scanning speed, as this is the key variable in dose delivery. The measured speed was found to be within 1% of the nominal speed for the range of speeds measured by an interferometer. Furthermore, dose measurements confirm the expected relationship between speed and dose and show that the measured dose is independent of the scan direction. Important dosimetric parameters such as peak dose, valley dose, the collimator output factor and peak-to-valley dose ratio are presented for 5 mm x 5 mm, 10 mm x 10 mm and 20 mm x 20 mm field sizes. Finally, a feasibility study on three glioma-bearing rats was performed. MRT and MBRT doses were prescribed to achieve an average dose of 65 Gy in the target, and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up was performed at various time points after irradiation to follow the tumour volume. Although it is impossible to draw conclusions on the different treatments with such a small number of animals, the feasibility of end-to-end preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies using the IMBL preclinical stage is demonstrated.",Excluded

3330,"Gold Nanorod-assisted Optical Stimulation of Neuronal Cells Recent studies have demonstrated that nerves can be stimulated in a variety of ways by the transient heating associated with the absorption of infrared light by water in neuronal tissue. This technique holds great potential for replacing or complementing standard stimulation techniques, due to the potential for increased localization of the stimulus and minimization of mechanical contact with the tissue. However, optical approaches are limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate deep into tissues. Moreover, thermal modelling suggests that cumulative heating effects might be potentially hazardous when multiple stimulus sites or high laser repetition rates are used. The protocol outlined below describes an enhanced approach to the infrared stimulation of neuronal cells. The underlying mechanism is based on the transient heating associated with the optical absorption of gold nanorods, which can cause triggering of neuronal cell differentiation and increased levels of intracellular calcium activity. These results demonstrate that nanoparticle absorbers can enhance and/or replace the process of infrared neural stimulation based on water absorption, with potential for future applications in neural prostheses and cell therapies.",Excluded
2634,"Characterization of a new rat model of experimental combined neurotrauma Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is present in two-thirds of patients with multiple injuries and in one-third combined with injuries of the extremities. Studies on interactive effects between central and peripheral injuries are scarce due to the absence of clinically relevant models. To meet the demand for ""more-hit"" models, an experimental model of combined neurotrauma (CNT) incorporating a standardized TBI via lateral fluid percussion (LFP) together with a peripheral bone fracture, i.e., tibia fracture, is introduced. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to four experimental groups: controls (n = 10), animals with TBI (n = 30), animals with tibia fracture (n = 30), and animals with CNT (n = 30). Morphological aspects of brain and bone injury were analyzed via standard histopathological procedures and x-ray. Trauma-induced neuromotor dysfunction was assessed using a standardized neuroscore. For interactive effects between injuries, we studied the extent and temporal pattern of circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels via immunoassay and callus formation at fracture sites by means of microradiography. LFP produced an ipsilateral lesion with cortical contusion, hemorrhage, mass shift, and neuronal cell loss (adjacent cortex and hippocampus CA-2/-3), along with contralateral neuromotor dysfunction. X-rays confirmed complete fractures in the middle of the bone shaft. The type of injury (P < 0.001) and time (P = 0.022) were significantly associated with increased IL-6 levels. CNT produced the highest IL-6 plasma levels with a maximum peak at 6 h after trauma (P < 0.001). Similarly, callus formation at fracture sites in CNT was significantly increased versus fracture only (P < 0,01). The CNT model mimics a variety of clinically relevant features known from human multiple injury, including TBI, and offers novel approaches for investigation of interactive mechanisms and therapeutic approaches.",Excluded

Treatment involved intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.05 mL) every 6-12 weeks. Treatment was discontinued at patient request or if there was no measurable response to therapy. Main outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity, ophthalmic examination, retinal photography, and angiography.RESULTS: Bevacizumab treatment was followed by reductions in retinal hemorrhage, exudation, and edema. Visual acuities were stable or improved in 86% (n=18). Three patients discontinued therapy. Each was legally blind before treatment (n=1), experienced little to no subjective improvement (n=2), or was poorly compliant (n=2). Three patients (14%) regained 2 or more lines of visual acuity. No ocular or systemic bevacizumab-related side effects were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab can be used to treat radiation retinopathy. In most cases treatment was associated with decreased vascular leakage, stabilization, or improved vision.

2696,"Simulated Microgravity and Low-Dose/Low-Dose-Rate Radiation Induces Oxidative Damage in the Mouse Brain Microgravity and radiation are stressors unique to the spaceflight environment that can have an impact on the central nervous system (CNS). These stressors could potentially lead to significant health risks to astronauts, both acutely during the course of a mission or chronically, leading to long-term, post-mission decrements in quality of life. The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to high concentrations of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids and low levels of antioxidant defenses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative damage in the brain cortex and hippocampus in a ground-based model for spaceflight, which includes prolonged unloading and low-dose radiation. Whole-body low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) gamma radiation using (57)Co plates (0.04 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) was delivered to 6 months old, mature, female C57BL/6 mice (n = 4-6/group) to simulate the radiation component. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Mice were hindlimb suspended and/or irradiated for 21 days. Brains were isolated 7 days or 9 months after irradiation and hindlimb unloading (HLU) for characterization of oxidative stress markers and microvessel changes. The level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein, an oxidative specific marker for lipid peroxidation, was significantly elevated in the cortex and hippocampus after LDR + HLU compared to controls (P < 0.05). The combination group also had the highest level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression compared to controls (P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the animals that received HLU only or combined LDR + HLU compared to control (P < 0.05). In addition, 9 months after LDR and HLU exposure, microvessel densities were the lowest in the combination group, compared to age-matched controls in the cortex (P < 0.05). Our data provide the first evidence that prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity and LDR radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers that may increase the likelihood of brain injury and reduced antioxidant defense. NOX2-containing nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH oxidase) may contribute to spaceflight environment-induced oxidative stress.",Included

1896,"More than skin deep Introduction: A 47-year-old female without significant past medical history presented to her PCP with complaints of generalized pruritus for 3 weeks. She had previously been evaluated at an urgent care facility where she was given a course of steroids for her symptoms. Although she had brief improvement with prednisone, her symptoms returned after the course ended. She denied any other systemic symptoms specifically weight loss, fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, or change in bowel habits. She had recently noticed darkening of her urine and possible jaundice, but stated this seemed to be improving. Her physical exam was notable for jaundice without evidence of chronic liver disease. Her abdomen was soft , non-tender, and she had no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation showed AST 166 IU/L, ALT 90 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.4 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase of 401 IU/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse dilation of intrahepatic ducts and a 1.5-cm common bile duct (CBD), as well as 4.8 x 6.7 cm heterogeneous mass in the gallbladder with a second similarly enhancing lesion seen at the distal CBD. The pancreas appeared normal. An ERCP was performed which revealed a polypoid appearing mass within the distal bile duct. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed and this was biopsied after eversion into the duodenal lumen. Initial differential included biliary cystadenoma/ adenocarcinoma versus atypical cholangiocarcinoma versus lymphoma or IPMN of the bile ducts. However, biopsy specimen showed pigmented deposition on H&E stain with subsequent positive staining for S-100 and HMB proteins consistent with melanoma. Unfortunately, a staging MRI of the brain showed evidence of metastatic lesions. Thorough skin, eye, and mucosal examination did not reveal evidence of a primary lesion, and a CT-PET scan showed large, hypermetabolic lesions in the gallbladder and distal bile duct without evidence of other primary source. Therefore, our final diagnosis is primary biliary melanoma with metastatic disease to the brain. Only 10 other cases of primary biliary melanoma have been reported in the literature to date. Mortality is based on stage of disease at presentation with surgical resection providing the best chance for survival. Unfortunately, our patient had metastases present at diagnosis and was not a candidate for surgery.

2628,"Precision dosimetry for narrow photon beams used in radiosurgery-determination of Gamma Knife output factors Treatment units for radiosurgery, like Leksell Gamma Knife and adapted, or dedicated, linear accelerators use small circular beams of ionizing radiation down to 4 mm in diameter at the isocenter. By cross-firing, these beams generate a high dose region at the isocenter together with steep dose gradients of up to 30% per mm. These units are used to treat small complex shaped lesions, often located close to critical structures within the brain, by superimposing several single high dose regions. In order to commission such treatment units for stereotactic irradiations, to carry out quality assurance and to simulate treatment conditions, as well as to collect input data for treatment planning, a precise dosimetric system is necessary. Commercially available radiation dosimeters only partially meet the requirements for narrow photon beams and small field sizes as used in stereotactic treatment modalities. The aim of this study was the experimental determination of the output factors for the field defining collimators used in Gamma Knife radiosurgery, in particular for the smallest, the 4 mm collimator helmet. For output factor measurements a pin point air ionization chamber, a liquid ionization chamber, a diode detector, a diamond detector, TLD microcubes and microrods, alanine pellets, and radiochromic films were used. In total, more than 1000 measurements were performed with these different detection systems, at the sites in Munich and Zurich. Our results show a resultant output factor for the 4 mm collimator helmet of 0.8741 +/- 0.0202, which is in good agreement with recently published results and demonstrates the feasibility of such measurements.

2529,"Management of patients with oligometastatic/ resectable stage IV NSCLC For the past decade, the standard first-line therapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with adequate ECOG performance status (<2) has been platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with a reported median overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months, which has slightly improved to 12 months with the addition of bevacizumab. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, gefitinib and erlotinib, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, crizotinib, have been shown to provide longer progression-free survival (PFS) and fewer side effects as first-line therapy, compared with chemotherapy in patients with certain histological subtypes and activating mutations. However, despite therapeutic developments, palliative treatment is standard for many stage IV NSCLC patients and the prognosis remains poor, with relative 5-year survival rates <=4%, compared with an average of approximately 17% for all patients with NSCLC. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a subgroup of stage IV NSCLC with a limited number/ number of sites of metastatic disease, usually 1-5 metastatic lesions. While only a small subset of patients present with such limited metastases (brain metastasis <50%, adrenal gland metastasis ~7%), they may be suitable for, and achieve long-term survival following, eradication of both the primary and metastatic tumours. For example, reported 5-year survival rates for NSCLC patients with solitary brain or adrenal metastasis who underwent surgical removal of both primary lung and metastatic disease ranged from 7-24% and 25-34%, respectively, which is higher than the average of <=4% for all stage IV NSCLC patients. In addition to having an adequate performance status, there are additional key prognostic factors for identifying oligometastatic NSCLC patients likely to benefit from aggressive therapy; staging of the metastatic lesions, lymph node involvement and status of the primary lung tumour. A lower number of metastatic sites is predictive of good clinical outcome, with >2 metastatic sites associated with shorter PFS. The organ involved in metastatic spread may also impact clinical outcome as, for instance, patients with brain and adrenal gland metastases are more suitable for surgical intervention compared with bone or liver. Given the importance of number and site of metastatic lesions, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are vital for accurate staging of oligometastatic disease. An association between N0 disease and increased long-term survival compared with N1/N2 disease has been observed. For example, following surgical treatment of one cohort of patients with solitary NSCLC adrenal gland metastasis, those with N2 disease had 0% median 5-year survival rate, compared with 52% for N0/N1 patients (P=0.001). Pathologic staging of lymph nodes is therefore critical. The status of the primary lung tumour also impacts clinical outcome, as the primary tumour must itself be resectable. Stage III primary disease is associated with worse survival outcome than stage I or II in patients undergoing surgical excision of brain and adrenal gland metastases, with a reported 5-year survival rate of 0% for stage III, compared with 63% and 77% for stage I and II, respectively. Similarly, patients with oligometastatic disease and a controlled primary site, or 'oligorecurrance', have better prognosis than those with an uncontrolled primary tumour. Histological subtype of NSCLC may also impact prognosis in oligometastatic NSCLC, with adenocarcinoma associated with the most favourable outcomes. Although an optimal disease-free interval (DFI) to define synchronous and metachronous disease has not been agreed upon, synchronous oligometastasis is generally associated with poorer survival outcomes. Patients receiving adrenalectomy for oligometastatic NSCLC with DFI <=6 months had median OS of 12 months versus 31 months for DFI >6 months. Similar results were reported for isolated brain metastasis. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a stage IV cancer and as a guiding principle therapy should be simple and minimally invasive. Furthermore, given the diffuse nature of this disease state, management should ideally involve a multidisciplinary team as the primary and metastatic cancer must be treated, requiring a wide range of expertise. Surgery and radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] in the brain and stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] in extracranial sites) are the two most common methods of tumour ablation. In general, radiosurgery is less invasive than surgery and is therefore useful for patients ineligible for surgery. Additionally, evidence suggests SBRT may be more applicable to limited extracranial metastasis to multiple organs compared with surgery. The treatment of limited brain metastases has been evaluated through several randomised clinical trials. Surgical resection plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of oligometastasis in the brain led to significantly prolonged OS compared with WBRT alone - as high as 40 weeks in one trial, compared with 15 weeks for WBRT (P<0.01). Further, a study of SRS with WBRT in patients with 1-4 brain metastases showed improved survival outcomes for patients with solitary brain metastases and improved clinical outcomes for patients with >1 site of metastatic disease, compared with WBRT alone. Overall, SRS plus WBRT is considered an acceptable choice for those patients with limited brain metastasis who are not suitable for surgery. Adrenalectomy is the standard of care for adrenal gland metastases, with OS ranging from 11-31 months. There have been no randomised trials of the use of SBRT in the adrenal gland setting, although one retrospective study reported OS of 23 months for isolated adrenal metastases treated with SBRT. Further, a recent review article of extracranial oligometastatic disease from various primary cancers suggests that survival following SBRT compares favourably to surgery. One of the key challenges for the management of oligometastatic NSCLC is continuing to improve diagnosis and prognostic factors to more accurately identify those patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who are likely to benefit from ablative treatment, as well as distinguish truly isolated metastatic disease from early-stage metastasis that later develops into widely disseminated disease. Continuing advances in imaging technology will play a role in refining diagnosis and prognosis. From a treatment perspective, challenges include cognitive problems associated with WBRT and the current lack of randomised trial data comparing surgery, radiosurgery and standard of care. To this end, there are several ongoing clinical trials, such as the randomized SABR-COMET study, which compares palliative radiation with stereotactic ablative radiation for <=3 metastatic tumours to any single organ.",Excluded
81,"Interstitial irradiation of brain metastases Randomized studies have shown that survival in patients with single brain metastases is significantly higher after the combined treatment of surgical removal and whole-brain irradiation than after whole-brain radiation therapy alone. In patients with deep-seated lesions or those located in critical sites of the brain, as well as in cases in which the patient's general condition makes general anaesthesia difficult or impossible microsurgical resection usually cannot be performed or only with an increased surgical risk. Stereotactic radiosurgery, which can be done by means of convergent beam irradiation or by the implantation of highly loaded 125I seeds, provides an alternative to open procedures. In the following we report on our results using a stereotactic radiosurgical technique. A series of 20 treatments is presented, in which biopsy was performed and 125I seeds were implanted, both under stereotactic conditions in the same session. The 125I seeds were sealed in a teflon catheter, were left indwelling temporarily, and then removed after application of the prescribed radiation dose (6,000cGy at the tumour margin). There was only one recurrence in our series, complications occurred in only one patient by temporary aggravation of a pre-existing hemiparesis. Our results indicate that interstitial irradiation of brain metastases is a valuable, less stressful alternative to both open microsurgery as well as to stereotactic radiosurgical convergent beam irradiation.",Excluded

In this study, we evaluated spine surgeons' knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine surgery.METHODS: We developed a questionnaire including questions about surgeons' characteristics and knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine surgery. A survey was performed with the members of AOSpine Latin America. The main variables studied were specialty, years of experience, surgeon's position during fluoroscopy, and practices to reduce the patient's and surgeon's radiation exposure during surgery. The results were analyzed and compared among different specialties, levels of experience, and countries of origin.RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 371 members of AOSpine Latin America from different countries. The sample was mostly from orthopedic surgeons (57.1%) and surgeons in practice for longer than 10 years (54.2%). Thyroid lead protection was used by 64.2% of the spine surgeons, lead glasses by 20.2%, and lead gloves by 7%. A dosimeter badge was never or only rarely used by 75.7%. The correct answer for surgeon position during lateral lumbar fluoroscopy was reported by only one-third of the surgeons.

Patients were reviewed at six or 12 monthly intervals for 2-19 years (median 9.5 years). Investigations included blood tests, chest X-ray, bone scan, neurophysiological studies, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine and cerebrospinal fluid examination.RESULTS: Symptoms began from six months to 20 years after radiotherapy (median time 1.5 years). Progressive weakness was universal and resulted in loss of any useful hand function in all but three patients. The time taken to loss of useful hand function ranged from six weeks to five years (median 1.25 years). Three patterns of upper limb weakness were identified, distal limb weakness only (13 patients), global limb weakness that was more marked distally (11 patients), and completely flaccid arm (10 patients). Seventeen patients required long-term morphine to palliate pain.

To date, IVIM has not been validated against contrast enhanced techniques for brain metastases after SRS. In the present study, we measure blood volume for 20 brain metastases (15 patients) at baseline, 1 week and 1 month after SRS using IVIM and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI. Correlation between blood volume measurements made with IVIM and DCE-MRI show poor correlation at baseline, 1 week, and 1 month post SRS (r = 0.33, 0.14 and 0.30 respectively). At 1 week after treatment, no significant change in tumor blood volume was found using IVIM or DCE-MRI (p = 0.81 and 0.41 respectively). At 1 month, DCE-MRI showed a significant decrease in blood volume (p = 0.0002). IVIM, on the other hand, demonstrated the opposite effect and showed a significant increase in blood volume at 1 month (p = 0.03). The results of this study indicate that blood volume measured with IVIM and DCE-MRI are not equivalent. While this may relate to differences in the type of perfusion information each technique is providing, it could also reflect a limitation of tumor blood volume measurements made with IVIM after SRS. IVIM measurements of tumor blood volume in the month after SRS should therefore be interpreted with caution.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty nine patients were included in the PRRT. Among them 16 patients (18%) were qualified for a repeated PRRT cycle due to progression of the disease. In one of the patients qualified for the repeated cycle, PRRT was used as neoadjuvant therapy. The results and side-effects of the repeated cycles of PRRT were analyzed. Result(s): Disease stabilization was observed in 10 patients 6 months after the repeated PRRT cycle and in 5 patients after 12 and 18 months. Ten of the patients who had received repeated PRRT cycles died. In the case of neoadjuvant therapy, further reduction of the tumor size was observed, enabling qualification for surgery. Clinically significant reduction in the mean values of morphological parameters was not observed. Only after 12 and 18 months the mean values of creatinine levels were higher than the normal range (only in 2 patients).

The IV formulation of MK-6240 for clinical use and the formulation used in the 7-day rat toxicity study was tested for hemolysis potential in human and Wistar rat whole blood. Sequential whole-body positron emission tomography scans were performed in three healthy young subjects after IV bolus injection of 180 +/- 0.3 MBq [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 to characterize organ biodistribution and estimate whole-body radiation exposure (effective dose).RESULTS: MK-6240 administered IV in a 7-day rat toxicity study did not show any test article-related changes. The no-observed-adverse-effect level in rats was >= 333 mug/kg/day which provides a margin 1000-fold over an anticipated maximum clinical dose of 0.333 mug/kg. Additionally, the MK-6240 formulation was not hemolytic in human or Wistar rat blood. [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 activity was widely distributed to the brain and the rest of the body, with organ absorbed doses largest for the gall bladder (202 muGy/MBq). The average (+/-SD) effective dose was 29.4 +/- 0.6 muSv/MBq, which is in the typical range for F-18 radiolabeled ligands.CONCLUSIONS: Microdoses of [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 are safe for clinical positron emission tomography imaging studies. Single IV administration of 185 MBq (5 mCi) [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 is anticipated to result in a total human effective dose of 5.4 mSv and thus allows multiple positron emission tomography scans of the same subject per year.",Excluded
1821,"Equivalent outcomes with hypofractionated, accelerated thoracic radiation therapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Does this represent a reasonable strategy in patients unable to attend twice daily treatment? Purpose/Objective(s): The publication of RTOG 8815 established hyperfractionated, twice-daily thoracic radiation therapy (BID RT) with concurrent platinum-etoposide (PE) as the standard of care in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). However, many patients with this aggressive, often debilitating malignancy find BID RT intolerable due to both physical and logistical limitations. As an alternative, patients unable to receive BID RT are treated with daily 3Gy fractions (QD RT) to a total dose of 45Gy at our institution.We hypothesized that hypofractionated QD RT in the setting of concurrent PE would be as safe and effective as BID RT. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with LS-SCLC treated with curative intent. Patients received 45Gy either QD (3Gy) or BID (1.5Gy) with concurrent PE. Covariables reviewed include age, gender, race, insurance status, year of diagnosis, 3D vs IMRT planning, PTV volume, chemotherapy agents and cycles, RT dose and fractionation, incidence of Grade >=2 radiation pneumonitis and subsequent delivery of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were utilized to compare the characteristics of treatment groups for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) estimates were generated, with accompanying univariate (UVA) log-rank and multivariate (MVA) Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Result(s): Thirty-six patients were evaluable, with a median follow-up of 13 months for the entire cohort (range 3-79), and a median follow-up of 18.5 months for survivors (range 7-73). 88% of patients were deceased at last follow-up. For the entire cohort, median age was 63 years (range 54-81). 24 (67%) patients received BID RT; 12 (33%) received QD RT. BID and QD groups were balanced with respect to age, race, sex, insurance status, PTV volume, and 3D vs IMRT planning. One patient in each group was treated with corticosteroids for radiation pneumonitis. No significant differences were observed for PFS or OS outcomes. 2-year PFS was 13.4% (BID) vs 16.7% (QD) (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-1.67; p<.61) and 2-year OS was 34.5% (BID) vs 31.7% (QD) (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.28-1.86; p<.51). Neither the incidence of Grade >= 2 radiation pneumonitis (p=0.61) nor utilization of PCI (BID 58% vs 50% QD, p=0.64) differed between the two groups. Conclusion(s): In this single-institution study, hypofractionated QD RT to 45Gy delivered with concurrent PE was associated with toxicity and outcomes comparable to BID RT with concurrent PE. Further validation with a larger, prospective dataset is warranted. Daily hypofractionated thoracic RT with concurrent chemotherapy represents a reasonable alternative for patients who cannot be treated twice daily.",Excluded
3525,"A study on neuromodulation for optimizing subthalamic-nuclei stimulating effect of varied frequency parameters to enhance the gait with dual tasking in parkinson's disease Introduction: Gait disturbances and freezing-episodes are broad in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and they worsen with dual (also multi) tasking. In PD, though, subthalamic-nuclei deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective-restorative-therapeutic option for enhancing motor, freezing-of-gait (FoG) and other axial-symptoms, albeit, its impact on gait-disturbances is hazy. Studies [1] suggest that low frequencies can augment gait-parameters provided frequency-parameters (including stimulation-intensity and pulse-width) are changed. Materials/Methods: 40Parkinson's post STN-DBS patients with gaitdisturbances were included in the study. All patients were on constant neurostimulation-parameters and dopaminergic-medication for a month prior to assessment. Gait-parameters were analyzed during-medication 'on' and DBS 'on' state, at 4 classes-of-frequencies 180Hz,130Hz,90Hz, and at 60Hz and DBS 'off' medication 'on' state. Gait was analyzed using stand-walk-sit (SWS) test and freezing-of-gait (FoG) scales. Total elapsed-times, number of steps/freezing episodes were analyzed in SWS test. Effect of dual-tasking on gait was analyzed using FoG score. While analyzing-parameters at differentfrequencies, Wilcoxon signed rank-test was employed. Result(s): 40Parkinson's on neuromodulation were studied, out of which 29 were male. Average mean-age was 55.45+10.76 years. Mean-duration of disease at the onset was 13.13+6.41 years. Post-surgery mean-duration was 3.58+2.4 years. 38Parkinson's showed significant-improvement in gait at a single-frequency, which was singular for each patient while 2patients showed optimal-response at two frequencies. In SWS-test, 17patients (42.5%) had good-response at 180Hz, 6(15%) at 130Hz,14(46.7%) at 90Hz,5 (12.5%) at 60Hz. [Table 1] Total FoG-scores and sub-scores based on dualtask also improved at similar frequencies. Discussion(s): Statistically-significant-improvement in all gait-parameters including dual-tasking at best-frequency in comparison to DBS 'off' and 130Hz, with chi2= 9.2857 with 2 degree-of-freedom, highly-significant at 5% (<0.0001). [Table 2] Optimal-frequency was independent of any demographic parameters, disease-severity or duration or other stimulation parameters [Fig 1]. There is a significant-effect of varying stimulation-frequencyparameters. The frequency-modulation certainly help PD patients with FoG and also axial-symptoms (particularly in case of bilateral STN-DBS). Conclusion(s): Optimization of frequency-parameter-setting for each Parkinson can recover gait yet with a cognitive-load. High and lowfrequencies may be of use and needs to be individualized. We also suggest that bilateral STN-stimulation enhances in case of the majority of axial-symptoms of Parkinson's and that a synergistic-result can be attained when DBS is used in concurrence with L-dopa. Objective(s): To compute the effect of varied frequency-parametersettings of STN-DBS in Parkinson's gait without and with dual tasking.",Excluded
1460,"[Acoustic neuroma in Iceland for 30 years (1979-2009)] INTRODUCTION: Acoustic neuroma (AN) is a tumor of the 8th cranial nerve. The goal of this study was to find the incidence of AN in Iceland from 1979 - 2009 as well as investigate other epidemiological factors.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group of patients with the AN diagnosis was gathered retrospectively through medical records. We looked at several epidemiological factors including age and symptoms at diagnosis, and the treatment chosen for each individual.RESULTS: The incidence rate of AN in Iceland is 1.24/100,000. About 10% of diagnosed tumors were found incidentally. Most of those were found in the last 10 years of the investigation and in that period fewer large and giant tumors at diagnosis. Present complaints of patients at diagnosis were hearing loss (69%), dysequilibrium/dizziness (47%) and tinnitus (43%). Treatments were surgery (n=47), observation (n=30) and gamma knife radiosurgery (n=16). We had information concerning postoperative hearing loss and facial paralysis in 39 patients who underwent surgery. Loss of hearing postoperatively occurred in 69% (n=27) and 44% (n=17) had facial paralysis. For an average of 3.5 years, 17% of tumors followed by imaging grew.CONCLUSION: The incidence of AN is similar to that in Europe and is increasing. More tumors are found incidentally. Small tumors can be followed by regular imaging, at least for the short term. Larger tumors are treated by surgery or gamma knife radiosurgery. A high percentage of patients receiving surgery lost their hearing postoperatively.",Included
2370,"Radionecrosis after stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases INTRODUCTION: Radionecrosis (RN) represents the main complication of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for brain metastases. It may be observed in up to 34% of cases at 24 months after treatment and associated with significant morbidity in 10-17%.AREAS COVERED: Our aim is to discuss the results of original studies on RN related to SRT for brain metastases. Expert commentary: Although the development of RN is unpredictable, larger volume of the lesion, prior whole brain irradiation, and higher dose of radiation represent the major risk factors. RN appears on MRI as contrast-enhancing necrotic lesions, surrounded by edema, occurring at least 3 months after SRT, localized within fields of irradiation. No firm criteria are established. Surgery can provide symptomatic relief but is associated with a risk of complications. Corticosteroids are considered the standard of care treatment, despite limited efficacy and many adverse effects. Bevacizumab represents another interesting option that needs to be validated.",Excluded
3504,"Interaction between age of irradiation and age of testing in the disruption of operant performance using a ground-based model for exposure to cosmic rays Previous research has shown a progressive deterioration in cognitive performance in rats exposed to (56)Fe particles as a function of age. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of age of irradiation independently of the age of testing. Male Fischer-344 rats, 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age, were exposed to 25-200 cGy of (56)Fe particles (1,000 MeV/n). Following irradiation, the rats were trained to make an operant response on an ascending fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule. When performance was evaluated as a function of both age of irradiation and testing, the results showed a significant effect of age on the dose needed to produce a performance decrement, such that older rats exposed to lower doses of (56)Fe particles showed a performance decrement compared to younger rats. When performance was evaluated as a function of age of irradiation with the age of testing held constant, the results indicated that age of irradiation was a significant factor influencing operant responding, such that older rats tested at similar ages and exposed to similar doses of (56)Fe particles showed similar performance decrements. The results are interpreted as indicating that the performance decrement is not a function of age per se, but instead is dependent upon an interaction between the age of irradiation, the age of testing, and exposure to HZE particles. The nature of these effects and how age of irradiation affects cognitive performance after an interval of 15 to 16 months remains to be established.",Included

222,"Does radiation exposure portend worse postoperative outcomes after cystectomy with urinary diversion for benign indications? INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative radiation exposure is traditionally thought to correlate with increased postoperative complications after cystectomy with urinary diversion (CxUD) for benign indications. We assessed postoperative outcomes among patients who received CxUD, stratified by radiation exposure. METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients undergoing CxUD over a 10 year period encompassed demographics, operative parameters, 30 and 90 day readmission and complications. CxUD for malignant indications and in patients below 18 years of age were excluded. Chi-square and t-test analyses assessed demographics and indications. Complications were measured by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULT(S): Among 103 patients, 39 (38%) had radiation exposure prior to CxUD. Mean age for patients with radiation exposure undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion was significantly higher (69.8 vs 59.7 years, p=0.001). In patients receiving preoperative radiation, 23.1% (9/39) had congestive heart failure (p=0.005). Other preexisting conditions such as diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, renal disease and liver disease were not associated with radiation exposure. Operative time (p=0.861), estimated blood loss (p=0.756) and length of stay (p=0.776) were not associated with radiation exposure. There was a significant correlation between radiation exposure and having a preoperative diagnosis of genitourinary fistulae (p=0.001), neurogenic bladder (p<0.0001) and urethral stricture (p=0.002). Radiation exposure did not correlate to readmission at 30 days (p=0.256) or at 90 days (p=0.576). Ureteroileal strictures requiring interventional radiology procedures were observed in 6 patients (5.8%) and stomal stenosis was seen in 2 patients (1.9%). Neither variable was correlated with radiation exposure (p=0.27 and p=0.265, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): In spite of patients being older with more comorbidities at baseline, patients with preoperative radiation exposure undergoing CxUD for benign indications did not have increased readmission at 30 or 90 days or increased complications postoperatively. Additionally, operative parameters such as surgery time, estimated blood loss and length of stay were similar between radiation and naive patient groups. These findings suggest radiation exposure prior to CxUD may not portend as negative consequences as once thought.",Included
3568,"Irradiation of intracerebral 9L gliosarcoma by a single array of microplanar x-ray beams from a synchrotron: balance between curing and sparing The purpose of this work was the understanding of microbeam radiation therapy at the ESRF in order to find the best compromise between curing of tumors and sparing of normal tissues, to obtain a better understanding of survival curves and to report its efficiency. This method uses synchrotron-generated x-ray microbeams. Rats were implanted with 9L gliosarcomas and the tumors were diagnosed by MRI. They were irradiated 14 days after implantation by arrays of 25 microm wide microbeams in unidirectional mode, with a skin entrance dose of 625 Gy. The effect of using 200 or 100 microm center-to-center spacing between the microbeams was compared. The median survival time (post-implantation) was 40 and 67 days at 200 and 100 microm spacing, respectively. However, 72% of rats irradiated at 100 microm spacing showed abnormal clinical signs and weight patterns, whereas only 12% of rats were affected at 200 microm spacing. In parallel, histological lesions of the normal brain were found in the 100 microm series only. Although the increase in lifespan was equal to 273% and 102% for the 100 and 200 microm series, respectively, the 200 microm spacing protocol provides a better sparing of healthy tissue and may prove useful in combination with other radiation modalities or additional drugs.",Included
1929,"Oxidative damage to mitochondria in normal and cancer tissues, and its modulation Cellular damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in normal tissues has been implicated in the etiology of several human ailments. Among the subcellular organelles, damage to mitochondria is considered crucial and can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death. However, the same damage, if it is selectively induced in cancer tissues can lead to its cure. Hence analyzing the mechanisms of such damage and its modulation may result in better prevention or cure. Using mitochondria derived from rat brain/liver as well as sarcoma 180 ascites cells, we have examined the mechanisms of damage to lipid, as assessed by different products of lipid peroxidation and to proteins, as determined by loss of enzyme activity and protein oxidation. Mechanisms involved, in terms of scavenging of ROS have been determined using pulse radiolysis for hydroxyl radical and histidine destruction assay for singlet oxygen. Various ROS were generated using gamma-radiation, photosensitization etc. under different conditions. Some novel porphyrins, with potential uses in photodynamic therapy also were used as photosensitizers. Our study shows that ROS can induce significant oxidative damage in mitochondria from both normal and tumor tissues and this can be inhibited by natural antioxidants like tocotrienols, nicotinamide and caffeine. Damage, on the other hand, can be enhanced by deuteration of the buffer and oxygenation. Our results hence demonstrated that mitochondria were sensitive to damage by ROS and its modulation may have potential uses in prevention of the disease in normal tissues; if damage can be selectively induced in tumor, it can lead to its regression.",Excluded
2478,"The role of radiation therapy in the treatment of small cell lung cancer Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are candidates for aggressive therapy because of their potential for long-term survival, especially patients with limited-stage disease. Although no treatment protocol can be considered 'standard', the best results in limited-stage SCLC appear to be produced by a combination of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation. Ongoing protocols testing the efficacy of thoracic irradiation should be able to settle question of the optimal treatment approach in limited-stage SCLC over the next 1 to 2 years. Careful attention to volume treated and the use of shrinking fields produce the best results with the minimum of toxicity. Treatment of extensive-stage SCLC has not been substantially improved to date with the addition of local systemic irradiation. Prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the incidence of CNS failure in SCLC and should be given, at a minimum, to patients achieving complete response status. Whether patients with partial response should also receive prophylactic cranial irradiation remains controversial. Finally, half-body radiation in SCLC is an experimental research technique that has shown some promise but remains quite toxic when combined with systemic chemotherapy.",Excluded
2073,"Exposure to long-term evolution radiofrequency electromagnetic fields decreases neuroblastoma cell proliferation via Akt/mTOR-mediated cellular senescence The aim of this study was to examine the potential effects of long-term evolution (LTE) radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) on cell proliferation using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. The growth rate and proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells were significantly decreased upon exposure to 1760 MHz RF-EMF at 4 W/kg specific absorption rate (SAR) for 4 hr/day for 4 days. Cell cycle analysis indicated that the cell cycle was delayed in the G0/G1 phase after RF-EMF exposure. However, DNA damage or apoptosis was not involved in the reduced cellular proliferation following RF-EMF exposure because the expression levels of histone H2A.X at Ser139 (gammaH2AX) were not markedly altered and the apoptotic pathway was not activated. However, SH-SY5Y cells exposed to RF-EMF exhibited a significant elevation in Akt and mTOR phosphorylation levels. In addition, the total amount of p53 and phosphorylated-p53 was significantly increased. Data suggested that Akt/mTOR-mediated cellular senescence led to p53 activation via stimulation of the mTOR pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. The transcriptional activation of p53 led to a rise in expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27. Further, subsequent inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4 produced a fall in phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb at Ser807/811), which decreased cell proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to RF-EMF might induce Akt/mTOR-mediated cellular senescence, which may delay the cell cycle without triggering DNA damage in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.

2142,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation of early visual cortex interferes with subjective visual awareness and objective forced-choice performance In order to study whether there exist a period of activity in the human early visual cortex that contributes exclusively to visual awareness, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the early visual cortex and measured subjective visual awareness during visual forced-choice symbol or orientation discrimination tasks. TMS produced one dip in awareness 60-120 ms after stimulus onset, while forced-choice orientation discrimination was suppressed between 60 and 90 ms and symbol discrimination between 60 and 120 ms. Thus, a time window specific to visual awareness was found only in the orientation condition at 120 ms. The results imply that both conscious and unconscious perception depend on activity in early visual areas. On the basis of previous estimates of neural processing speed, we suggest that the late part of the activity period most likely involve local extrastriate-striate interactions which provide the contents for visual awareness but are not themselves sufficient for awareness to arise.",Excluded
2271,"State-dependent bidirectional modification of somatic inhibition in neocortical pyramidal cells Cortical pyramidal neurons alter their responses to input signals depending on behavioral state. We investigated whether changes in somatic inhibition contribute to these alterations. In layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat visual cortex, repetitive firing from a depolarized membrane potential, which typically occurs during arousal, produced long-lasting depression of somatic inhibition. In contrast, slow membrane oscillations with firing in the depolarized phase, which typically occurs during slow-wave sleep, produced long-lasting potentiation. The depression is mediated by L-type Ca2+ channels and GABA(A) receptor endocytosis, whereas potentiation is mediated by R-type Ca2+ channels and receptor exocytosis. It is likely that the direction of modification is mainly dependent on the ratio of R- and L-type Ca2+ channel activation. Furthermore, somatic inhibition was stronger in slices prepared from rats during slow-wave sleep than arousal. This bidirectional modification of somatic inhibition may alter pyramidal neuron responsiveness in accordance with behavioral state.",Excluded

Apomorphine is found to have no significant influence on the dopamine level in brain and striatum of non-irradiated rats, while L-DOPA and its combination with apomorphine raise this level. On the 72nd hour after irradiation with 900 R there is no essential change in the dopamine level in brain and the striatum; apomorphine raises the dopamine level in brain and striatum; the effect of L-DOPA and its combination with apomorphine is potentiated with respect to the increase of the dopamine level in brain and striatum.",Included

Single doses up to 40 Gy were applied. Parotid saliva samples were collected, and the three lobes of the parotid gland were examined individually on the macro- and micromorphologic level up to 1 year after irradiation.RESULTS: Dose-dependent loss of gland weight was observed 1 year after total or partial X-irradiation. Weight loss of the glands correlated very well with loss of secretory function. Irradiating the cranial 50% volume (implicating a shielded lateral lobe) resulted in substantially more damage in terms of weight loss and loss of secretory function than 50% caudal irradiation (shielding the ventral and dorsal lobe). Histologic examinations of the glands 1 year after irradiation revealed that the shielded lateral lobe was severely affected, in contrast to the shielded ventral and dorsal lobes. Time studies showed that irradiation of the cranial 50% volume caused late development of secondary damage in the shielded lateral lobe, becoming manifest between 240 and 360 days after irradiation. The possible clinical significance of this finding is discussed.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the observed region-dependent volume effect for late function loss in the rat parotid gland after partial irradiation is mainly caused by secondary events in the shielded lateral lobe. The most probable first step (primary radiation event) in the development of this secondary damage is radiation exposure to the hilus region (located between the ventral and dorsal lobe). By injuring major excretory ducts and supply routes for blood and nerves in this area, the facility system necessary for proper functioning of the nonexposed lateral lobe is seriously affected. The unexpected volume effect in the rat might have consequences for treatment strategies in radiotherapy, implicating not only salivary glands but also other organs with a seemingly homogeneous distribution of radiosensitive elements, a situation wherein volume effects have not been anticipated up to now.",Included

ON included optic neuritis (NNO) and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). For each subject, the PLR was recorded, to red, yellow, green, and blue stimuli for durations of 4 and 12 s, and for stimulus intensities of 4 lx and 28 lx.RESULTS: Comparison between control and RP or ON patient results showed that responses after stimulus onset were significantly different for most stimulus conditions, but the post-stimulus amplitudes at 3 s and 7 s after light extinction were not. On the other hand, the difference between the ON and RP groups was significant only for post-stimuli time-points and only for blue stimuli. Differences between responses to blue and red were significantly different, predominantly at post stimulus time-points. A ROC analysis revealed that the maximal constriction amplitudes to a 4 lx, 4 s yellow stimulus are significantly different in ON vs RP patients, and the responses to a 4 s, 28 lx blue stimulus at 7 s post-stimulus are significantly different in controls vs ON vs RP patients with a high specificity.CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary light responses to blue light in healthy, RP, and ON subjects are significantly different from one another.

Purpose(s): The aim of the current study is to assess technical success, complication rates and procedural efficiency in TRA and transfemoral approach (TFA) in a large prospective European registry adopting the hybrid algorithm for CTO PCI (RECHARGE). Method(s): We analyzed 1253 CTO PCI procedures performed according to the hybrid protocol in 17 European centers, comparing TRA (single or bi-radial access) and TFA (single or bi-femoral or combined radial and femoral access). Result(s): TRA was applied in 306 (24%, 159 unilateral radial, 147 bilateral radial) and TFA in 947 (76%, 126 unilateral femoral, 271 bilateral femoral, 550 combined radial and femoral access) cases.

1533,"Dose-dependent changes in renal (1)H-/(23)Na MRI after adjuvant radiochemotherapy for gastric cancer PURPOSE: Combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) for gastric cancer with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to the upper left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) allows kidney sparing despite improved target coverage. Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x ""positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined.RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.",Included

We describe biological evaluation of a novel theranostic agent targeted to microtubules. Methyl N-[5-(3'-[<sup>131</sup>I]iodobenzoyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]carbamate (1) and methyl N-[5-(3'-[<sup>125</sup>I]iodobenzoyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]carbamate (2) were synthesized from a common precursor 3'-stannylated derivative (4). Antiproliferative effects and radiotoxicity of <sup>131</sup>I-labeled beta-particle emitting 1 were examined in vitro in human neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cells lines. The therapeutic potential of 1 was also examined in a subcutaneous mouse model of human glioblastoma U-87 MG. Compound 1 at the extracellular radioactive concentration of 0.35 MBq/mL, easily achievable in vivo, kills >90% of neuroblastoma cells and >60% glioblastoma cells as measured in a clonogenic assay. D<inf>10</inf> doses established for 1 indicate that as few as 3,000 decays are sufficient to kill 90% of BE(2)-C cells. Even U-87 MG cells, the least sensitive of the tested cell lines, require <20,000 decays of intracellular <sup>131</sup>I to reduce number of clonogenic cells by 90%. Biodistribution studies of 2 delivered either intratumorally or intraperitoneally show a similar tissue distribution for both routes of the drug administration. The whole body clearance half-lives were on average 6 hr. Intratumor administration of 1 produces significant tumor growth delay. After a single dose of 8.4 +/- 0.3 MBq of compound 1, the tumor doubling times were 3.2 +/- 0.1 and 7.9 +/- 0.6 days in control and treated mice, respectively.

This inhibition could impair motor function of the affected hand. We investigated if inhibitory 1~Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the contralesional M1 improved motor performance of the affected hand in acute stroke.METHODS: A double-blind study of real versus placebo rTMS was conducted. Twelve patients early after subcortical stroke (mean: 7 days) received 1200 stimuli of real and placebo rTMS in a crossover design. The sequence of stimulations was counterbalanced across subjects. Stimulus intensity was subthreshold (90% of motor threshold at rest). Motor function was tested by grip strength recordings and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) executions before and after each rTMS session.RESULTS: Compared to sham stimulation, real rTMS improved NHPT results but not grip strength in the affected hand. No change of performance was observed for the unaffected hand. NHPT baseline repetitions in a subgroup of patients indicated stable motor performance prior to the rTMS sessions.CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that therapeutic rTMS applications over the contralesional hemisphere are feasible in acute stroke patients and can transiently improve dexterity of the affected hand. RTMS may become an additional tool for early neurorehabilitation.",Excluded

The effect of SV40 transformation and immortalisation on the gamma-irradiation survival of skin derived fibroblasts from normal individuals and from ataxia-telangiectasia patients and heterozygotes We have compared cell killing following 60Co gamma irradiation in 22 primary human fibroblast strains, nine SV40-immortalized human fibroblast lines and seven SV40-transformed pre-crisis human fibroblast cultures. We have examined material from normal individuals, from ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients and from A-T heterozygotes. We have confirmed the greater sensitivity of A-T derived cells to gamma radiation. The distinction between A-T and normal cells is maintained in cells immortalized by SV40 virus but the immortal cells are more gamma radiation resistant than the corresponding primary fibroblasts. Cells transformed by plasmids (pSV3gpt and pSV3neo) expressing SV40 T-antigen, both pre- and post-crisis, show this increased resistance, indicating that it is expression of SV40 T-antigen, rather than immortalization per se which is responsible for the change. We use D0, obtained from a straight line fit, and D, estimated from a multitarget curve, as parameters to compare radiosensitivity. We suggest that both have their advantages; D0 is perhaps more reproducible, but D is more realistic when comparing shouldered and non-shouldered data.",Excluded

Maximal activity of 2-oxoglutarate- and succinate dehydrogenases, as well as of aspartate-2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate-2-oxoglutarate in the brain tissue was measured within 30 days after the exposure. Dehydrogenase activity was measured in the brain cortex, limbic system and in the cerebellum; transaminase activity was determined in the brain cortex, diencephalic zone and in the hypophysis. It was found that small doses of irradiation resulted in an oscillating increase of dehydrogenase activity with a decrease of the amplitude by the 30th day of the experiment. As the dose of irradiation increases, the periods of normal activity change into phases of inhibition of dehydrogenase action, the period of oscillations diminishes. Transaminase activity, as a rule, changes in a phase in a reversible manner as compared with dehydrogenase activity. These observations are discussed from the point of view of structural relations between these two systems in the intramitochondrial supramolecular structures, the so-called metabolons.",Included

Irinotecan/cisplatin have been shown to be superior to a standard treatment with etoposide/cisplatin in extensive disease SCLC. The present phase I study aims to assess the feasibility of irinotecan/cisplatin administered concurrently with radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients were treated concurrently with conventional fractionated radiotherapy (1.8-45 Gy + 9 Gy (RP)) and two cycles of irinotecan (40/50/60 mg/m2, Day 1/8/15, 29/36/43) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2, Days 1-3, 29-31), and four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy (CT). In addition, patients in complete remission (CR) received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any case grade III/IV non-hematological toxicity (esophagitis grade IV), grade IV leukopenia or grades III/IV thrombopenia (CTC) during RCT.RESULTS: No DLT was observed; an irinotecan dose of 60 mg/m2 is recommended. 3/12 patients developed grade III leukopenia, one grade II pneumonitis.

Thymopentin (10 mg/kg/day/7 days) was injected intraperitoneally in groups of C57BL/6 mice. Then, interleukin-1 alpha was administered on day 7. Twenty hr later, all groups were given whole body sublethal irradiation of 750 rad by 60Co elements. In some groups of mice, treatment with thymopentin was continued for 1 week after irradiation. Efficacy of the combination treatment was assessed by evaluation of mortality, as well as by histologic examination of the brain, testis, bone marrow, heart and spleen. The combination of relatively low doses of interleukin-1 alpha (700 U) with thymopentin yielded a survival which was nearly that observed with interleukin-1 alpha (1000 U) given alone (about 100%). The optimal effect was observed in animals treated for 15 days with thymopentin, either in combination or alone. In addition, incidence and severity of histological lesions were also lower in animals with the some treatment schedule.

1314,"Limitations of analytical dose calculations for small field proton radiosurgery The purpose of the work was to evaluate the dosimetric uncertainties of an analytical dose calculation engine and the impact on treatment plans using small fields in intracranial proton stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS) for a gantry based double scattering system. 50 patients were evaluated including 10 patients for each of 5 diagnostic indications of: arteriovenous malformation (AVM), acoustic neuroma (AN), meningioma (MGM), metastasis (METS), and pituitary adenoma (PIT). Treatment plans followed standard prescription and optimization procedures for PSRS. We performed comparisons between delivered dose distributions, determined by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and those calculated with the analytical dose calculation algorithm (ADC) used in our current treatment planning system in terms of dose volume histogram parameters and beam range distributions. Results show that the difference in the dose to 95% of the target (D95) is within 6% when applying measured field size output corrections for AN, MGM, and PIT. However, for AVM and METS, the differences can be as great as 10% and 12%, respectively. Normalizing the MC dose to the ADC dose based on the dose of voxels in a central area of the target reduces the difference of the D95 to within 6% for all sites. The generally applied margin to cover uncertainties in range (3.5% of the prescribed range + 1 mm) is not sufficient to cover the range uncertainty for ADC in all cases, especially for patients with high tissue heterogeneity. The root mean square of the R90 difference, the difference in the position of distal falloff to 90% of the prescribed dose, is affected by several factors, especially the patient geometry heterogeneity, modulation and field diameter. In conclusion, implementation of Monte Carlo dose calculation techniques into the clinic can reduce the uncertainty of the target dose for proton stereotactic radiosurgery. If MC is not available for treatment planning, using MC dose distributions to adjust the delivered doses level can also reduce uncertainties below 3% for mean target dose and 6% for the D95.",Excluded
2985,"[Role of radiotherapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma] BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in multiple myeloma; but there are no curative options. Therefore, the treatment rationale is characterized by reduction of symptoms and inhibition of complications. Regarding reduction of pain, treatment of (impending) fractures, and spinal cord compression radiation is an important part of palliative treatment. In our retrospective study we report the effect of radiotherapy on reduction of pain, recalcification and the reduction of neurological symptoms and evaluate factors which have an impact on therapeutic outcome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1, Jan 1988 to 31, Dec 1998, 42 patients (19 women, 23 men; range of ages 46 to 85 years, median age 64.9 years) with 71 target volumes were irradiated (median dose 36 Gy, 2 to 3 Gy 5 times/week) because of symptomatic disease (67/71: osseous pain, 45/71: fractures/impending fractures, 13/71: spinal cord compression) (Tables 1 and 2). The median time from diagnosis to the first course of radiotherapy was 11.9 months (0.3 to 90 months). At the time of first irradiation, 5 and 37 patients were in tumor Stage II and III (Salmon/Durie), respectively. The median value of the Karnofsky performance was 70% (40 to 90%).RESULTS: During follow-up (at least 6 months) in 85% of target volumes complete and partial pain relief (measured by patients' perception and the use of analgetic medication) was achieved; recurrences were seen in 8.8%. In 26/56 (46.4%) lesions evaluable a recalcification was seen whereas 17.9% showed progressive disease (comparison of radiographs before and after radiation). In 22.3% of all lesions initially with impending fracture (4/18) radiotherapy failed because of fracture after treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Simultaneous chemotherapy and a Karnofsky performance > or = 70 had a significant impact on a positive response to treatment, respectively. Spinal cord compression symptoms were reduced in 7/13 (53.8%) of patients (scaled due to the classification by Findlay 1987). The median survival from diagnosis for the entire group was 34.9 months (7.5 to 119.3 months), after irradiation 13.1 months (0.2 to 105.3 months) (Figure 1).CONCLUSION: When adequately indicated radiotherapy has shown to be an effective palliative treatment. Taking under consideration that the results are retrospective we suppose that in multiple myeloma the local response to radiation is supported by a favorable performance status and simultaneous chemotherapy.

It also raised brain cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and calcium (Ca(2+)) level. Furthermore, I/R provoked an inflammatory response reflected by an increment in serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interlukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Moreover, induction of I/R in irradiated rats resulted in a further increase in brain oxidative stress and cytosolic LDH activity, disturbed brain Ca(2+) homeostasis and exaggerated the inflammatory reaction. During irradiation, administration of each of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and rutin to irradiated rats before induction of I/R, alleviated the brain oxidative stress. Moreover, these antioxidants caused attenuation of the rise of the cytosolic activities of GPx and GR. A lowering effect of the cytosolic LDH activity and Ca(2+) level were caused by treatment with antioxidants. Each of vitamin E and rutin revealed an anti-inflammatory action of these antioxidants, while CoQ10 had no effect on serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that supplementation with either vitamin E, CoQ10 or rutin ameliorated most of the biochemical changes induced by I/R in irradiated rat brain and serum.",Included

Method(s): A total of 53 biopsies of primary lung tumor adenocarcinoma stage IV treatment-naive were analyzed for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST and were processed in R using Bioconductor libraries. All patients were evaluated with brain MRI at diagnosis with a 3-month follow-up for BM development. Patients were classified into two groups: early-BM( < 6 months) and late- BM( > 6 months). A second independent cohort of 55 patients was analyzed to validate the gene expression signature (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00862173 ).

Background(s): Patients with epilepsy frequently receive head imaging. Data from other populations demonstrates that radiation exposure such as that received in imaging studies may increase the risk of certain cancers and overall mortality. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed radiation exposure from imaging studies for the prior 5 years for 50 consecutive adult patients seen in a tertiary epilepsy. The original studies where reviewed to directly calculate the radiation exposure for each exam. Brain dose and bone marrow dose from SPECT, CT, FDG-PET was calculated based on published models. Result(s): The mean brain dose was 9.1 mGy and the mean bone marrow dose was 2.3 mGy. According to Pearce's mode this amount of radiation exposure doubles the risk of developing brain cancer or leukemia and by the BEIR Committee's formula, increase the risk of death from cancer by approximately 28 in 1,000,000 over the baseline risk of 2,000/1,000,000. Among the 50 patients, 17 of them had scans of either SPECT and/or CT and/or PET. These 17 patients had an average if 26.7 mGy of brain exposure and 6.8. mGy of bone marrow exposure. The highest brain exposure was 80 mGy, while the highest bone marrow exposure was 30.4 mGy. By Pearce's mode, these individuals may have up to a 3 fold increase in the risk of later developing brain tumors or leukemia. Conclusion(s): Patients with epilepsy may be at increased risk of developing fatal cancers from radiation exposure from common imaging procedures. Neurologists caring for patients with epilepsy should be judicious in ordering studies that expose patients to radiation.

483,"Low (20 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle radiation lead to a persistent reduction in the spatial learning ability of rats Exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is considered to be a potential health risk in long-term space travel, and it represents a significant risk to the central nervous system (CNS). The most harmful component of GCR is the HZE [high-mass, highly charged (Z), high-energy] particles, e.g. <sup>56</sup>Fe. In previous ground-based experiments, exposure to high doses of HZE-particle radiation induced pronounced deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rodents. Recent data suggest that glutamatergic transmission in hippocampal synaptosomes is impaired after low (60 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles, which could lead to impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. To assess the effects of mission-relevant (2060 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles on hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, male Wistar rats either received sham treatment or were irradiated and tested 3 months later in the Barnes maze test. Compared to the controls, rats that received 20, 40 and 60 cGy 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles showed significant impairments in their ability to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze, which was manifested by progressively increasing escape latency times over the 3 days of testing. However, this increase was not due to a lack of motivation of the rats to escape, because the total number of head pokes (and especially incorrect head pokes) remained constant over the test period. Given that rats exposed to X rays did not exhibit spatial memory impairments until >10 Gy was delivered, the RBE for 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle-induced hippocampal spatial memory impairment is ~50. These data demonstrate that mission-relevant doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles can result in severe deficits in hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive tasks, and the extreme sensitivity of these processes to 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles must arise due to the perturbation of multiple processes in addition to killing neuronal cells.

Method(s): Eight clinical variables and 39 DVH parameters were extracted for each patient, who received radiotherapy for HGG with active follow-up. Ninety-five patients were randomly divided into training and testing cohorts, and we employed random survival forest (RSF), support vector machine (SVM), and Cox proportional hazards (CPHs) models to predict survival. Calibration plots, concordance indexes, and decision curve analyses were used to evaluate the calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility of these three models. Result(s): The RSF model showed the best performance among the three models, with concordance indexes of 0.824 and 0.847 in the training and testing sets, respectively, followed by the SVM (0.792/0.823) and CPH (0.821/0.811) models. Specifically, in the RSF model, we identified age, gross tumor volume (GTV), grade, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and D99 as important variables associated with survival. The AUCs of the testing set were 92.4%, 87.7%, and 84.0% for 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival, respectively. According to this model, HGG patients can be divided into high- and low-risk groups. Conclusion(s): The machine learning-based RSF model integrating both clinical and DVH variables is an improved and useful tool for predicting the survival of HGG patients.

2931,Neuromuscular toxicity of therapy The peripheral nervous system is frequently impaired in patients who have cancer. This impairment often results from toxicity of treatment but may also be due to direct invasion by tumor or may be part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. This review summarizes the recent literature regarding peripheral neuropathies and myopathies that are seen in patients with cancer. Highlights include the neuromuscular toxicity of some of the newer chemotherapeutic agents and immune mediators such as taxol and interleukin-2; a discussion of some of the agents being investigated for chemoprotection and rescue; an assessment of the evidence supporting the concept of motor neuron disease as a paraneoplastic disorder; and an interesting case report of megakaryoblastic leukemia invading peripheral nerves. Also summarized are some nice reviews and prospective studies of the toxicity of more conventional treatments. [References: 27],Excluded
381,"Differentiating embryonic stem-derived neural stem cells show a maturation-dependent pattern of voltage-gated sodium current expression and graded action potentials A population of mouse embryonic stem (ES)-derived neural stem cells (named NS cells) that exhibits traits reminiscent of radial glia-like cell population and that can be homogeneously expanded in monolayer while remaining stable and highly neurogenic over multiple passages has been recently discovered. This novel population has provided a unique in vitro system in which to investigate physiological events occurring as stem cells lose multipotency and terminally differentiate. Here we analysed the timing, quality and quantity of the appearance of the excitability properties of differentiating NS cells which have been long-term expanded in vitro. To this end, we studied the biophysical properties of voltage-dependent Na(+) currents as an electrophysiological readout for neuronal maturation stages of differentiating NS cells toward the generation of fully functional neurons, since the expression of neuronal voltage-gated Na(+) channels is an essential hallmark of neuronal differentiation and crucial for signal transmission in the nervous system. Using the whole cell and single-channel cell-attached variations of the patch-clamp technique we found that the Na(+) currents in NS cells showed substantial electrophysiological changes during in vitro neuronal differentiation, consisting mainly in an increase of Na(+) current density and in a shift of the steady-state activation and inactivation curves toward more negative and more positive potentials respectively. The changes in the Na(+) channel system were closely related with the ability of differentiating NS cells to generate action potentials, and could therefore be exploited as an appropriate electrophysiological marker of ES-derived NS cells undergoing functional neuronal maturation.",Excluded
3027,"Single domain antibody (SBT-100) crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and inhibits human glioblastoma by selectively targeting KRAS and P-STAT3 Background: Glioblastoma is difficult to treat malignancy that has a high incidence of KRAS mutations ( > 90%) and hyper-expression of P-STAT3 ( > 90%). Most chemotherapeutic agents and large biologics (four chain heterotetrameric IgG) cannot cross the BBB. Therefore Singh Biotechnology's (SBT) propriety technology has developed a novel targeted therapy and engineered SBT-100 a 15 kD single domain antibody (sdAb) that is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3, which can cross the BBB to target gliablastomas. Method(s): Human glioblastoma (U87MG) cell line was used and obtained from ATCC. Biacore affinity assay was used to demonstrate SBT-100 binding to KRAS, KRAS (G12D), and STAT3. The glioblastoma cells were incubated with 0ug/ml to 200ug/ml of SBT-100. MTT assay was performed after 3 days of treatment with SBT-100 and the growth inhibition was calculated. Xenograft (athymic nude mouse) with a well established tumor growing for 6 weeks was injected with SBT-100 intraperitoneally (IP). After 15 minutes the brain of this animal was harvested for immunohistochemical staining. Result(s): Biacore studies showed SBT-100 binds KRAS with affinity constant of 10- 9M, KRAS (G12D) at 10- 8M, and STAT3 at 10- 8M. MTT assay reveals 62% (p < 0.01) growth inhibition of U87MG within 3 days. A xenograft mouse with a well established tumor ( > 150mm<sup>3</sup>), when injected IP with 5mg/kg of SBT-100 showed localization in the brain within 15 minutes. Therefore SBT-100 (sdAb) crosses the BBB, and shows intracellular localization in the animal's neurons and glial cells. Conclusion(s): SBT-100 significantly inhibits the growth of glioblastoma. KRAS mutations and/or over expression of P-STAT3 in glioblastomas are promising targets for sdAbs like SBT-100, which is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3. SBT-100 crosses the BBB and localizes within the neurons and glial cells of the brain. SBT's proprietary single domain antibody technology platform used to engineer SBT- 100 holds promise for targeting primary brain malignancies, metastatic cancers that go to the brain, and for neurologic disease amenable to targeted therapy. Many chemo-resistant and radiation-resistant cancers use STAT3 as an escape mechanism.",Excluded

Sustained exposure to static magnetic fields at 100 mT for up to 9 DIV significantly decreased expression of MAP-2 and NeuN in cultured rat hippocampal neurons without markedly affecting GAP-43 expression. Although a significant increase was seen in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampal neuronal preparations cultured for 6-9 DIV under sustained magnetism, GFAP and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression were not affected markedly in cultured astrocytes prepared from rat hippocampus and neocortex, irrespective of cellular maturity. No significant alteration was seen in cell survivability of hippocampal neurons or astrocytes cultured under sustained magnetism. In hippocampal neurons cultured for 3 DIV under sustained magnetism, marked mRNA expression was seen for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits, NR1, NR2A-2C, NR2D, and NR3A. In addition, significant potentiation of the ability of NMDA to increase intracellular free Ca(2+) ions was observed. Differential display analysis revealed a significant decrease in mRNA expression for the transcription factor ALF1 in response to sustained magnetism for 3 DIV. These results suggest that sustained exposure to static magnetic fields may affect cellular functionality and maturity in immature cultured rat hippocampal neurons through modulation of expression of particular NMDA receptor subunits.",Excluded

The onset of light induces in these cells a slow inward current shift associated with decrement of slope conductance. The reversal potential (Erev) of the light induced current (IL) and its changes due to altered extracellular concentration of potassium support the assumption that (IL) is due to suppression of K+ conductance. Elevation of intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP by adding 8-bromo-cGMP into the bathing solution or by injecting the nucleotide into the cell mimics, in all cases, the effect of light: it produces an inward current accompanied by decrement of slope conductance. The effect of elevation of cAMP was inconsistent. The I-V relations of IL and IcGMP follow a similar course and have a common Erev. The assumption that 3',5'-cyclic GMP is increased by light is also supported by comparing the effect of light and the cyclic nucleotide on the action potential.

No marked increase in fetal mortality or growth retardation was observed below 0.25 Gy; the increase in these parameters was significant only at 0.50 Gy. A significant reduction in head size and brain weight and a significant increase in the incidence of microphthalmia were observed at doses above 0.15 Gy. Detectable levels of microcephaly and microphthalmia were evident even at 0.10 Gy. A linear dose response was seen for these effects in the dose range of 0.05 to 0.15 Gy.

The radiobiologic parameters that characterized the dose-response survival curve for these cells were found to be n = 1.9, Dq = 140 rad, and D0 = 190 rad. Morphologically, nuclear and cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolation of cytoplasm, and giant cell formation occurred in a dose dependent manner after 24 hours from irradiation. Decreased staining intensity for F VIII RAg was observed in morphologically affected cells. The capacity to synthesize PGI2 was significantly enhanced at 24 hours, but less significant at 72 hours after irradiation. The present data suggest that the radiosensitivity of brain capillary endothelial cells may be somewhat lower than that of endothelial cells originated from larger vessels, and that radiation induced morphological and functional changes in the brain capillary endothelial cells may be quantitatively similar to the changes in endothelial cells of larger vessels.",Included

After a short summary of the mechanism of action of irradiation therapy and the types of different irradiation techniques, the therapeutic effects and side effects are analyzed in patients with different types of pituitary tumors, including our own experience with conventional radiotherapy and radiosurgery in patients with acromegaly. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has long been used to control growth and/or hormonal secretion of residual or recurrent pituitary tumors. However, patient selection for conventional radiotherapy still remains a controversial issue, because a number of potentially significant side effects, including hypopituitarism and other complications, have been described. Stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery methods have several potential advantages over conventional radiotherapy, including their use in patients with residual or recurrent pituitary tumors who had previously been treated by conventional radiotherapy, but long-term follow-up data with these relatively new techniques are still limited.

1872,"The modulatory role of taurine in retinal ganglion cells Taurine (2-aminoethylsuphonic acid) is present in nearly all animal tissues, and is the most abundant free amino acid in muscle, heart, CNS, and retina. Although it is known to be a major cytoprotectant and essential for normal retinal development, its role in retinal neurotransmission and modulation is not well understood. We investigated the response of taurine in retinal ganglion cells, and its effect on synaptic transmission between ganglion cells and their presynaptic neurons. We find that taurine-elicited currents in ganglion cells could be fully blocked by both strychnine and SR95531, glycine and GABA(A) receptor antagonists, respectively. This suggests that taurine-activated receptors might share the antagonists with GABA and glycine receptors. The effect of taurine at micromolar concentrations can effectively suppress spontaneous vesicle release from the presynaptic neurons, but had limited effects on light-evoked synaptic signals in ganglion cells. We also describe a metabotropic effect of taurine in the suppression of light-evoked response in ganglion cells. Clearly, taurine acts in multiple ways to modulate synaptic signals in retinal output neurons, ganglion cells.",Excluded
24,"Patch-basis electrocortical source imaging in epilepsy In this study, we developed numerical methods for investigating the sources of epileptic activity from intracranial EEG recordings acquired from intracranial subdural electrodes (iEEG) in patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the epilepsy center of the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). The data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA), which identifies and isolates maximally independent signal components in multi-channel recordings. A realistic individual head model was constructed for a patient undergoing pre-surgical evaluation. Structural models of gray matter, white matter, CSF, skull, and scalp were extracted from pre-surgical MR and post-surgical CT images. The electromagnetic source localization forward problem was solved using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). Source localization was performed using the Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) algorithm. The multiscale patch-basis source space constructed for this purpose includes a large number of dipole elements on the cortical layer oriented perpendicular to the local cortical surface. These source dipoles are combined into overlapping multi-scalepatches. Using this approach, we were able to detect seizure activity on sulcal walls and on gyrus of the cortex.",Excluded

However, the biological effects due to exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) produced by mobile phones are largely unknown. Environmental and occupational exposure of humans to gamma-rays is a biologically relevant phenomenon. Consequently studies were undertaken to examine the interactions between gamma-rays and EMF on human health. In this study, exposure to 900-MHz EMF expanded gamma-ray damage to SHG44 cells. Preexposure EMF enhanced the decrease in cell proliferation induced by gamma-ray irradiation and the rate of apoptosis. The combination of EMF and gamma-ray exposure resulted in a synergistic effect by triggering stress response, which increased reactive oxygen species, but the expression of hsp70 at both mRNA and protein levels remained unaltered. Data indicate that the adverse effects of gamma-rays on cellular functions are strengthened by EMF.",Excluded

Synthesis of RNA and proteins decreased significantly after 2h-long irradiation. Irradiation which lasted for 30 days has somewhat shortened the level of reparative DNA synthesis and has almost twice increased RNA synthesis.

Doses over 1 Gy have induced an exponential delay of dose-dependent changes in the level of synthetic processes.",Included
414,"Accelerator-based epithermal neutron sources for boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors This paper reviews the development of low-energy light ion accelerator-based neutron sources (ABNSs) for the treatment of brain tumors through an intact scalp and skull using boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). A major advantage of an ABNS for BNCT over reactor-based neutron sources is the potential for siting within a hospital. Consequently, light-ion accelerators that are injectors to larger machines in high-energy physics facilities are not considered. An ABNS for BNCT is composed of: (1) the accelerator hardware for producing a high current charged particle beam, (2) an appropriate neutron-producing target and target heat removal system (HRS), and (3) a moderator/reflector assembly to render the flux energy spectrum of neutrons produced in the target suitable for patient irradiation. As a consequence of the efforts of researchers throughout the world, progress has been made on the design, manufacture, and testing of these three major components. Although an ABNS facility has not yet been built that has optimally assembled these three components, the feasibility of clinically useful ABNSs has been clearly established. Both electrostatic and radio frequency linear accelerators of reasonable cost (approximately 1.5 M dollars) appear to be capable of producing charged particle beams, with combinations of accelerated particle energy (a few MeV) and beam currents (approximately 10 mA) that are suitable for a hospital-based ABNS for BNCT. The specific accelerator performance requirements depend upon the charged particle reaction by which neutrons are produced in the target and the clinical requirements for neutron field quality and intensity. The accelerator performance requirements are more demanding for beryllium than for lithium as a target. However, beryllium targets are more easily cooled. The accelerator performance requirements are also more demanding for greater neutron field quality and intensity. Target HRSs that are based on submerged-jet impingement and the use of microchannels have emerged as viable target cooling options. Neutron fields for reactor-based neutron sources provide an obvious basis of comparison for ABNS field quality. This paper compares Monte Carlo calculations of neutron field quality for an ABNS and an idealized standard reactor neutron field (ISRNF). The comparison shows that with lithium as a target, an ABNS can create a neutron field with a field quality that is significantly better (by a factor of approximately 1.2, as judged by the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-dose that can be delivered to a tumor at a depth of 6cm) than that for the ISRNF. Also, for a beam current of 10 mA, the treatment time is calculated to be reasonable (approximately 30 min) for the boron concentrations that have been assumed. [References: 46]",Excluded

The shift was found to exert a significant influence on the functional state of the nervous system promoting the development or aggravation of autonomous dysfunction. In some cases, it causes an elevation of blood pressure to the level of risk for cerebral vascular disease. The effect of shift on the cerebral bioelectric activity of NPS operators manifests itself in the decrease of percentage of unchanged EEG, increase of alpha-rhythm spectral power density in the parietal leads and theta-rhythm in the posterior temporal and parietal leads. These changes may be caused by weariness as well as the effects of adverse factors the operators were exposed to at the NPS.

In eight patients with primary dystonia who were treated with bilateral chronic pallidal stimulation, we correlated symptom-related electromyogram (EMG) activity of the most affected muscles with the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the globus pallidus electrodes. In 5 dystonic patients with mobile involuntary movements, rhythmic EMG bursts in the contralateral muscles were coherent with the oscillations in the pallidal LFPs at the burst frequency. In contrast, no significant coherence was seen between EMG and LFPs either for the sustained activity separated out from the compound EMGs in those 5 cases, or in the EMGs in 3 other cases without mobile involuntary movements and rhythmic EMG bursts. In comparison with the resting condition, in both active and passive movements, significant modulation in the GPi LFPs was seen in the range of 8-16 Hz. The finding of significant coherence between GPi oscillations and rhythmic EMG bursts but not sustained tonic EMG activity suggests that the synchronized pallidal activity may be directly related to the rhythmic involuntary movements. In contrast, the sustained hypertonic muscle activity may be represented by less synchronized activity in the pallidum. Thus, the pallidum may play different roles in generating different components of the dystonic symptom complex.",Excluded

This study shows that in prenatal mice brains the repair capacity for 8-oxoG is 5-10-fold higher than in adult mice brains. Western blot analysis and repair activity in extracts from Ogg1(-/-) mice revealed that OGG1 was responsible for the efficient 8-oxoG removal from prenatal mice. To investigate how OGG1 protects against oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis, pregnant Big Blue/wild-type and Big Blue/Ogg1(-/-) mice were exposed to nontoxic doses of gamma radiation. A 2.5-fold increase in the mutation frequency in Ogg1(-/-) mouse brains was obtained by exposure to 3.5 Gy at day 19 postfertilization. This was largely due to GC to TA transversions, believed to originate from 8-oxoG mispairing with A during replication. Furthermore, rapid cell divisions seemed to be required for fixation of mutations, as a similar dose of radiation did not increase the mutation frequency, or the frequency of GC to TA transversion, in the adult brain.",Excluded

These results are independent of the specific attentional domain investigated. This scenario allows to conclude that there is a substantial lack of evidence about a negative influence of non-ionizing radiations on attention functioning.

Background(s): Glioblastoma remains one of the most lethal human cancers, with median survival of just 12-15 months after surgical debulking, chemotherapy, and radiation. Numerous molecular targets are being explored for the development of novel therapeutics, but efficacy of these new compounds is limited given the lack of personalized utilization based on known genotypic information. Furthermore, the correlation between driver genetic mutations and various phenotypic characteristics that portend poor prognosis are unknown, thereby diminishing the use of potentially effective medications in the sickest patients. Recently, ontological databases have been developed to better detect genotype-phenotype-environment relationships, with the aim of identifying novel substrates or employing known genomic abnormalities for therapeutic development. Design/Methods: This study focuses on the development of a new multicenter glioblastoma ontology database, with the goal to identify key genotypic characteristics that associate with poor prognosis. Patients were enrolled in the study at each site, clinical information was entered retrospectively into a Redcap database, glioblastoma tissue samples were subjected to whole genome analysis, and a clinical ontology was created based on historical information provided. Result(s): The creation of this glioblastoma ontology serves as proof-of-principle for the potential for clinically meaningful hypothesis generation with such an instrument and as a template for other investigators, who can use relationships described in this ontology to analyze information in their own institutional repositories.

2304,"Analysis of the ATM protein in wild-type and ataxia telangiectasia cells Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a human disorder that results in a number of clinical symptoms, including cerebellar degeneration and increased cancer predisposition. Recently the gene that is defective in A-T has been cloned and designated ATM. Here, we describe the production of antisera raised against the approximately 350 kDa ATM protein. Antisera specificity is confirmed by them recognising a approximately 350 kDa polypeptide in wild-type cells but not in A-T cells containing mutations that truncate ATM upstream of the antibody binding sites. We show that ATM is almost exclusively nuclear and is expressed in all cell lines and tissues analysed. However, ATM levels are not regulated in response to u.v. or ionising radiation. These data are consistent with ATM being a component of the DNA damage detection apparatus rather than being an inducible downstream effector of the DNA damage response. In addition, we analyse ATM protein expression in a variety of A-T patients. Strikingly, ATM expression is reduced drastically or absent in all patients analysed, including those predicted to express proteins that should be detected by our antisera. Thus, the A-T phenotype may result not only from mutations that disrupt functional domains of ATM, but also from mutations that destabilise the ATM mRNA or protein. Finally, we report that a group of patients displaying an intermediate A-T phenotype express low levels of apparently full-length ATM. This suggests that the ATM pathway is partially active in these individuals and that there is a correlation between levels of residual ATM expression and disease severity.",Excluded

Splenic T lymphocytes from B6CF1 mice were grown in round-bottomed 96-microwell culture plates with or without the selective agent 6-thioguanine (6-TG). The mutant frequency, as a result of exposure to neutrons or 60Co photons, increased 100-fold with dose. Doses of 150 cGy neutrons and 750 cGy 60Co photons were equally mutagenic. When animals were injected with WR-2721 at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight, i.p., 30 min before whole-body irradiation with JANUS neutrons or 60Co photons, mutant frequencies were significantly reduced at all radiation doses (i.e. protection factors of 1.4 and 2.4, respectively). Thus, the aminothiols are effective antimutagens. A novel clinical application of these compounds could be in their use to protect against radiation- and/or chemotherapy-induced genotoxic damage to normal cells.",Included

3432,"Incidence and management of late adverse radiation effects after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery Background: Late adverse radiation effects (ARE) typically occur many years after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). They are characterized by perilesional edema or cyst formation and are distinct from radiationinduced changes (RIC) noted in the first 1 to 2 years after AVM SRS and radiation necrosis. Objective(s): To determine the incidence of late ARE after AVM SRS. Method(s): Retrospective review of 233 AVM patients having SRS from 1990 to 2009. Patients had sporadic AVM, no prior radiation, and a minimum of 5 years of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up. The median MRI follow-up after SRS was 9.8 years (range, 5-24.2). Result(s): Late ARE were observed in 16 patients (6.9%) at a median of 8.7 years after SRS (range, 2.0-16.1). The 5-, 10-, and 15-year incidence of late ARE was 0.4%, 7.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. Eight patients (3.4%) were symptomatic at the time of ARE detection. Three of 8 patients who were initially asymptomatic had documented cyst progression (at 11, 40, and 42 months), for an overall symptomatic rate of 4.7%. Five patients with asymptomatic ARE have been observed for a median of 9.3 years (range, 2.0-14.1) without progression. Patients having early RIC (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, P < .001), patients having obliteration (HR=1.24, P=.02), and patients having SRS before April 1997 (HR=1.12, P=.02) weremore likely to develop late ARE. Conclusion(s): Late ARE are common in AVM patients who develop early RIC after SRS. Resection of the thrombosed AVM and the adjacent damaged tissue is effective at eliminating the mass effect and improving patients' neurological condition.

2608,"The effect of exposure to 60Co accelerated electrons and gamma quanta on the activity of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes in the rat brain. [Russian] In experiments with 112 male Wistar rats it was shown that accelerated electrons (85 Gy) caused a significant increase in activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDG) by 15.8% and lactate dehydrogenase (LDG) by 17.0%, and a decrease in activities of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) by 10.6 and 7.8% respectively within the sensorimotor region of the cerebral cortex immediately after irradiation. Activity of SDG and MAO decreased (by 16.4% and 7.8% respectively) in the caudate nucleus over the same period of time. An increase in the accelerated electron dose from 85 to 500 Gy did not change the direction and the rate of the radiation response of the enzymes. Exposure of rats to 60Co gamma quanta (75 Gy) increased SDG and LDG activity (by 21.4 and 17.3% respectively) within the sensorimotor cortex as late as 10 min after irradiation.

The cohort size was increased by 19% and follow-up extended by 3 years over the previous analysis. Radiation doses were estimated using an updated dosimetry system: Mayak Worker Dosimetry System 2008 (MWDS-2008). For the first time, in an analysis of this cohort, quantitative smoking data were used. Workers of the study cohort were exposed occupationally to prolonged external gamma rays and internal alpha particles. The mean (+/-standard deviation) total dose from external gamma rays was 0.54 +/- 0.76 Gy (95% percentile 2.21 Gy) for males and 0.44 +/- 0.65 Gy (95% percentile 1.87 Gy) for females. The mean plutonium body burden in the 31% of workers monitored for internal exposure was 1.32 +/- 4.87 kBq (95% percentile 4.71 kBq) for males and 2.21 +/- 13.24 kBq (95% percentile 4.56 kBq) for females. The mean total absorbed alpha-particles dose to the liver from incorporated plutonium was 0.23 +/- 0.77 Gy (95% percentile 0.89 Gy) in males and 0.44 +/- 2.11 Gy (95% percentile 1.25 Gy) in females. After adjusting for nonradiation factors (gender, age, calendar period, employment period, facility, smoking, alcohol consumption), there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence associated with total absorbed dose from external gamma rays and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal alpha-particle radiation exposure. Excess relative risks per Gy (ERR/Gy) were 0.46 (95% CI 0.37, 0.57) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16, 0.42), respectively, based on a linear dose-response model. Adjustments for additional factors (hypertension, body mass index, duration of employment, smoking index and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal exposure during the analysis of external exposure and vice versa) had little effect on the results. The categorical analyses showed that CVD incidence was significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses and that CVD incidence was also significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-particle doses to the liver from incorporated plutonium greater than 0.01 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. The results of the categorical analyses of CVD incidence were in good agreement with a linear dose response for external gamma-ray doses but for internal alpha-particle doses the picture was less clear. For the first time an excess risk of CVD mortality was seen in workers whose livers were exposed to internal alpha-particle doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those workers who were exposed to doses of less than 0.01 Gy. A significant increasing trend for CVD mortality with internal alpha-particle dose was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed at doses <1.0 Gy after having adjusted for nonradiation factors, ERR/Gy = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.09, 1.92). These updated results provide good evidence for a linear trend in risk of CVD incidence with external gamma-ray dose. The trend for CVD incidence with internal alpha-particle dose is less clear due to the impact of issues concerning the use of dose estimates based on below the limit of detection bioassay measurements.",Included
2238,"Comparison between dose values specified at the ICRU reference point and the mean dose to the planning target volume BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare dose values specified at the reference point, as recommended by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, ICRU, and the mean dose to the planning target volume, PTV.MATERIAL AND METHODS: CT-based dose calculations were performed with a 3-D treatment planning system for 6 series of patients treated for bladder, brain, breast, lung, oropharynx and parotid gland tumour. All patients were arbitrarily chosen from a set of previously treated patients irradiated with a two- or three-field technique using customised blocks. Appropriate wedge angles and beam weights were chosen to make the dose distribution as homogeneous as possible.RESULTS: The dose at the ICRU reference point was generally higher than the mean dose to the PTV. The difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV for an individual patient was less than 3% in 88% of cases and less than 2% in 72% of the cases. The differences were larger in those patients where the dose distribution is significantly influenced by the presence of lungs or air gaps. For each series of patients the mean difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV was calculated. The difference between these two values never exceeded 2%. Because not all planning systems are able to calculate the mean dose to the PTV, the concept of the mean central dose, the mean of the dose values at the centre of the PTV in each CT slice, has been introduced. The mean central dose was also calculated for the same patients and was closer to the mean dose to the PTV than the ICRU reference dose.CONCLUSION: The mean dose to the PTV is well estimated by either the ICRU reference dose or the mean central dose for a variety of treatment techniques for common types of cancer.",Excluded

3102,"Microwave irradiation of rats at 2.45 GHz activates pinocytotic-like uptake of tracer by capillary endothelial cells of cerebral cortex Far-field exposures of male albino rats to 2.45-GHz microwaves (10-microseconds pulses, 100 pps) at a low average power density (10 mW/cm2; SAR approximately 2 W/kg) and short durations (30-120 min) resulted in increased uptakes of tracer through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The uptake of systemically administered rhodamine-ferritin complex by capillary endothelial cells (CECs) of the cerebral cortex was dependent on power density and on duration of exposure. At 5 mW/cm2, for example, a 15-min exposure had no effect. Near-complete blockade of uptake resulted when rats were treated before exposure to microwaves with a single dose of colchicine, which inhibits microtubular function. A pinocytotic-like mechanism is presumed responsible for the microwave-induced increase in BBB permeability.",Excluded
1969,"Effect of Gamma Knife surgery on the risk of rupture prior to AVM obliteration The incidence for hemorrhage in non-obliterated arteriovenous malformations (AVM) during the first two years following Gamma Knife (GK) surgery was compared to the calculated incidence in untreated patients. There was a decrease in the incidence of hemorrhage as compared to the natural course. This difference was statistically significant. The actual number of hemorrhages during the first two years was 49 in a series of 1604 patients. Additionally, 41 hemorrhages occurred beyond the two years following treatment over the entire follow up time span of up to 24 years. For the first two years the calculated incidence was roughly two times higher than the observed incidence. This impact on the natural history was detectable already within six months after the treatment for the malformations totally covered with at least 25 Gy. The relation between a high minimum and a high average dose on the one hand and a lower risk for hemorrhage on the other hand was statistically significant. Low treatment doses and high age correlated to a higher risk. Neither hemorrhage prior to treatment nor time interval between presenting hemorrhage and treatment seemed to influence the risk for post treatment hemorrhage. The risk for permanent neurological deficit or death due to AVM rupture during the latency period between the time of treatment and total nidus obliteration was less than 0.5% for small AVM and 2-4% for large ones during the first two years. Of the 24 patients with sequelae following AVM rupture after treatment 14 died and 10 remained with neurological deficit of different degrees. However, all survivors were self sufficient.",Included
842,"Effects of spaceflight on ocular counterrolling and the spatial orientation of the vestibular system We recorded the horizontal (yaw), vertical (pitch), and torsional (roll) eye movements of two rhesus monkeys with scleral search coils before and after the COSMOS Biosatellite 2229 Flight. The aim was to determine effects of adaptation to microgravity on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The animals flew for 11 days. The first postflight tests were 22 h and 55 h after landing, and testing extended for 11 days after reentry. There were four significant effects of spaceflight on functions related to spatial orientation: (1) Compensatory ocular counterrolling (OCR) was reduced by about 70% for static and dynamic head tilts with regard to gravity. The reduction in OCR persisted in the two animals throughout postflight testing. (2) The gain of the torsional component of the angular VOR (roll VOR) was decreased by 15% and 50% in the two animals over the same period. (3) An up-down asymmetry of nystagmus, present in the two monkeys before flight was reduced after exposure to microgravity. (4) The spatial orientation of velocity storage was shifted in the one monkey that could be tested soon after flight. Before flight, the yaw axis eigenvector of optokinetic afternystagmus was close to gravity when the animal was upright or tilted. After flight, the yaw orientation vector was shifted toward the body yaw axis. By 7 days after recovery, it had reverted to a gravitational orientation. We postulate that spaceflight causes changes in the vestibular system which reflect adaptation of spatial orientation from a gravitational to a body frame of reference. These changes are likely to play a role in the postural, locomotor, and gaze instability demonstrated on reentry after spaceflight.",Included
2593,"Symptoms 10-17 years after breast cancer radiotherapy data from the randomised SWEBCG91-RT trial BACKGROUND: Postoperative radiotherapy decreases the risk for local recurrence and improves overall survival in women with breast cancer. We have limited information on radiotherapy-induced symptoms 10-17 years after therapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 1997, women with lymph node-negative breast cancer were randomised in a Swedish multi-institutional trial to breast conserving surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. In 2007, 10-17 years after randomisation, the group included 422 recurrence-free women. We collected data with a study-specific questionnaire on eight pre-selected symptom groups.RESULTS: For six symptom groups (oedema in breast or arm, erysipelas, heart symptoms, lung symptoms, rib fractures, and decreased shoulder mobility) we found similar occurrence in both groups. Excess occurrence after radiotherapy was observed for pain in the breast or in the skin, reported to occur ""occasionally"" by 38.1% of survivors having undergone radiotherapy and surgery versus 24.0% of those with surgery alone (absolute difference 14.1%; p=0.004) and at least once a week by 10.3% of the radiotherapy group versus 1.7% (absolute difference 8.6%; p=0.001). Daily life and analgesic use did not differ between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Ten to 17 years after postoperative radiotherapy 1 in 12 women had weekly pain that could be attributed to radiotherapy. The symptoms did not significantly affect daily life and thus the reduced risk for local recurrence seems to outweigh the risk for long-term symptoms for most women.",Included
1362,"Adult patient doses in interventional neuroradiology We investigated radiation doses to 149 adult patients who underwent interventional neuroradiologic procedures, consisting of 132 patients who had diagnostic imaging examinations and 17 patients who had therapeutic procedures. The interventional procedures were carried out on a biplane system capable of performing fluoroscopy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The x-ray imaging system was interfaced to a patient dosimetry system, which computed surface (skin) doses based on the selected radiographic technique factors in each of the radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging modes. For each patient, an assessment was made of the maximum surface dose received during the procedure, which predicts the possibility of inducing deterministic effects. Knowledge of the surface doses, beam quality and x-ray cross sectional area permitted the computation of the total energy imparted to each patient. Energy imparted values were converted to effective dose, which provides an estimate of the stochastic radiation risk to the patient. The median surface dose for the frontal plane during diagnostic imaging examinations was 1.3 Gy, with a maximum surface dose of 5.1 Gy. The median surface dose for the frontal plane during therapeutic procedures was 2.8 Gy with a maximum surface dose of 5.0 Gy. Ratios of the lateral to frontal median surface doses were 0.47 for diagnostic examinations and 0.68 for interventional procedures. The median energy imparted was 1.8 J during fluoroscopy, and 4.3 J during radiography, showing that on average, 66% of the patient exposure comes from radiographic imaging (DSA). For diagnostic examinations, the median patient effective dose was 33 mSv, with a maximum of 152 mSv. For therapeutic procedures, the median patient effective dose was 74 mSv, with a maximum of 156 mSv.

285,"Space-clamp problems when voltage clamping neurons expressing voltage-gated conductances The voltage-clamp technique is applicable only to spherical cells. In nonspherical cells, such as neurons, the membrane potential is not clamped distal to the voltage-clamp electrode. This means that the current recorded by the voltage-clamp electrode is the sum of the local current and of axial currents from locations experiencing different membrane potentials. Furthermore, voltage-gated currents recorded from a nonspherical cell are, by definition, severely distorted due to the lack of space clamp. Justifications for voltage clamping in nonspherical cells are, first, that the lack of space clamp is not severe in neurons with short dendrites. Second, passive cable theory may be invoked to justify application of voltage clamp to branching neurons, suggesting that the potential decay is sufficiently shallow to allow spatial clamping of the neuron. Here, using numerical simulations, we show that the distortions of voltage-gated K(+) and Ca(2+) currents are substantial even in neurons with short dendrites. The simulations also demonstrate that passive cable theory cannot be used to justify voltage clamping of neurons due to significant shunting to the reversal potential of the voltage-gated conductance during channel activation. Some of the predictions made by the simulations were verified using somatic and dendritic voltage-clamp experiments in rat somatosensory cortex. Our results demonstrate that voltage-gated K(+) and Ca(2+) currents recorded from branching neurons are almost always severely distorted.",Excluded
178,"Phase measurement of cognitive impairment specific to radiotherapy PURPOSE: Memory impairment is an early-delayed effect of radiotherapy (RT). The prospective longitudinal measurement of the cognitive phase effects from RT was conducted on treated and untreated brain tumor patients. The study design investigated semantic vs. perceptual and visual vs. verbal memory to determine the most disease-specific measure of RT-related changes and understanding of the neurotoxicity from RT to the brain.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tests of memory that had previously shown RT-related phasic changes were compared with experimental tests of memory to test hypotheses about cognition targeted to the neural toxicity of RT. The results from 41 irradiated and 29 nonirradiated patients with low-grade, supratentorial tumors were analyzed. The methods controlled for comorbid white matter risk, recurrence, interval after treatment, and age (18-69 years). The effects were examined before RT and at three points after RT to 1 year using a mixed effects model that included interval, group, surgical status, medication use, practice, and individual random effects. Four new tests of memory and other candidate cognitive tests were investigated, and a post hoc analysis of a comprehensive battery of tests was performed to identify the cognitive processes most specific to RT.RESULTS: The RT effects on memory were identified in the treated group only; among the new tests of memory and the complete neurocognitive battery, the RT effects were significant only for delayed recall (p < 0.009) and interval to recognize (p < 0.002). Tumor location was not related to the treatment effect. Memory decline was specific to retrieval of semantic memories; a double dissociation of semantic from perceptual visual memory was demonstrated in the RT group.CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate memory dependent on the semantic cortex and the hippocampal memory system. A cognitive measurement that is brief but specific to neural mechanisms is effective and feasible for studies of RT damage.",Included
3219,"The involvement of ATF4 and S-opsin in retinal photoreceptor cell damage induced by blue LED light PURPOSE: Blue light is a high-energy emitting light with a short wavelength in the visible light spectrum. Blue light induces photoreceptor apoptosis and causes age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. In the present study, we investigated the roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by blue light-emitting diode (LED) light exposure in murine photoreceptor cells.METHODS: The murine photoreceptor cell line was incubated and exposed to blue LED light (464 nm blue LED light, 450 lx, 3 to 24 h). The expression of the factors involved in the unfolded protein response pathway was examined using quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblot analysis. The aggregation of short-wavelength opsin (S-opsin) in the murine photoreceptor cells was observed with immunostaining. The effect of S-opsin knockdown on ATF4 expression in the murine photoreceptor cell line was also investigated.RESULTS: Exposure to blue LED light increased the bip, atf4, and grp94 mRNA levels, induced the expression of ATF4 protein, and increased the levels of ubiquitinated proteins. Exposure to blue LED light in combination with ER stress inducers (tunicamycin and dithiothreitol) induced the aggregation of S-opsin. S-opsin mRNA knockdown prevented the induction of ATF4 expression in response to exposure to blue LED light.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the aggregation of S-opsin induced by exposure to blue LED light causes ER stress, and ATF4 activation in particular.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed all 3T MRS, DSC and DWI studies performed for suspicion of malignant glioma recurrence between October 2006 and December 2008. Maximum Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr peak-area and peak-height ratios were recorded for both multi-voxel and single-voxel MRS. Maximum cerebral blood volume (CBV) and minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were normalized to white matter. Histopathology and clinical-radiologic follow-up served as reference standards. Receiver operating characteristic curves for each parameter were compared. Result(s): Forty lesions were classified as glioma recurrence (n = 30) or posttreatment effect (n = 10). Diagnostic performance was similar for CBV ratio (AUC = 0.917, P < 0.001), multi-voxel Cho/Cr peak-area (AUC = 0.913, P = 0.002), and multi-voxel Cho/NAA peak-height (AUC = 0.913, P = 0.002), while ADC ratio (AUC = 0.726, P = 0.035) did not appear to perform as well. Single-voxel MRS parameters did not reliably distinguish tumor recurrence from posttreatment effects. Conclusion(s): A 3T DSC and multi-voxel MRS Cho/Cr peak-area and Cho/NAA peak-height appear to outperform DWI for distinguishing glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects. Single-voxel MRS parameters do not appear to distinguish glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects reliably, and therefore should not be used in place of multi-voxel MRS.

39,"Diffusion tensor imaging contributes to differentiate Richardson's syndrome from progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism Objective: Abnormal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of the superior cerebellar peduncles were reported in patients with Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS). A few studies showed that PSP-RS patients had DTI alterations also in the corpus callosum, internal capsulae, and long-range white matter (WM) tracts. However, most of the previous studies did not include the atypical clinical presentations of PSP. The aims of this study were to investigate the regional distribution of WM damage in patients with PSP-RS and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism (PSP-P) using DTI, and quantify the DTI classificatory ability in diagnosing PSP syndromes, when used in combination with infratentorial volumetry. Method(s): In 37 PSP (21 PSP-RS, 16 PSP-P) and 42 controls, tractbased spatial statistics was applied. DTI metrics were derived from supratentorial, thalamic, and infratentorial tracts. Brain atrophy was investigated using voxel-based morphometry. The MR parkinsonism index (MRPI), a combined conventional MRI measurement taking into account the midbrain and pons areas and the SCP and middle cerebellar peduncle widths, was calculated. Result(s): In PSP, grey matter (GM) atrophy involved fronto-temporal lobes and basal ganglia, and was greater in PSP-RS than PSP-P. PSP-RS had a more severe and distributed WM loss, including the midbrain, SCP, and prefrontal and motor/premotor regions. All PSP harboured diffusivity abnormalities in the corpus callosum, frontoparietal and fronto-temporo-occipital tracts. Infratentorial WM and thalamic radiations were severely affected in PSP-RS and relatively spared in PSP-P. When MRPI and DTI measures were combined, the discriminatory power increased from 0.92 to 0.98 for PSP-RS vs. controls, from 0.70 to 0.82 for PSP-P vs. controls, and from 0.77 to 0.84 for PSP-RS vs. PSP-P. Conclusion(s): Distinct patterns of GM and WM alterations occur in PSP-RS and PSP-P. Adding DTI measures to MRPI improves the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating each PSP syndrome from healthy individuals and each other.",Excluded
3465,"A pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein mediates the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor inhibition of melatonin release in photoreceptive chick pineal cell cultures The avian pineal gland is a photoreceptive organ that has been shown to contain postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors that inhibit melatonin synthesis and/or release upon receptor activation. Physiological response and [32P]ADP ribosylation experiments were performed to investigate whether pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) were involved in the transduction of the alpha 2-adrenergic signal. For physiological response studies, the effects of pertussis toxin on melatonin release in dissociated cell cultures exposed to norepinephrine were assessed. Pertussis toxin blocked alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin-induced blockade appeared to be noncompetitive. One and 10 ng/ml doses of pertussis toxin partially blocked and a 100 ng/ml dose completely blocked norepinephrine-induced inhibition. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP ribosylation of G-proteins in chick pineal cell membranes was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Membranes were prepared from cells that had been pretreated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin. In the absence of pertussis toxin pretreatment, two major proteins of 40K and 41K mol wt (Mr) were labeled by [32P]NAD. Pertussis toxin pretreatment of pineal cells abolished [32P] radiolabeling of the 40K Mr G-protein in a dose-dependent manner. The norepinephrine-induced inhibition of both cAMP efflux and melatonin release, as assessed by RIA of medium samples collected before membrane preparation, was also blocked in a dose-dependent manner by pertussis toxin. Collectively, these results suggest that a pertussis toxin-sensitive 40K Mr G-protein labeled by [32P]NAD may be functionally associated with alpha 2-adrenergic signal transduction in chick pineal cells.",Excluded

[Japanese] The patient was a 65-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Stage ffi A triple-negative breast cancer (T2N2aM0) at the age of 63. AC chemotherapy (3 months) followed by paditaxel plus bevacizumab (4 months) was administered as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, she underwent mastectomy and lymph node dissection. Pathological examination revealed a partial response. After surgery, radiotherapy with a radiation dose of 50 Gy was applied to the chest wall and supraclavicular lymph node. Multiple pulmonary metastases and mediastinal lymph node metastases were diagnosed 23 months after initial treatment, and she was treated with S-1 administration. Two months after S-1 treatment, the PET-CT showed metastasis in the right atrium. Since there were no cardiac symptoms, S-1 treatment was continued without cardiovascular treatment. However, the mediastinal lymph node metastasis progressed; and therefore, S-1 administration was stopped and chemotherapy with eribulin was initiated. Brain metastasis was diagnosed at the same time and treated with a gamma knife. Although chemotherapy with eribulin was continued, the patient died 33 months after initial treatment owing to the brain metastasis. The cardiac metastasis did not progress during chemotherapy with eribulin. There was no sign of heart failure or arrhythmia during the treatment.

615,"Clinical outcome and toxicity in central located stage I or isolated recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): The centrally located lesion for lung cancer presents a clinical challenge for stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) due to its potential severe toxicities. The optimal regimen remains unclear. We seek to investigate the clinical outcome and toxicities of SABR for central located stage I or isolated recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials/Methods: One hundred one patients with 101 central lesions, defined as being located within 2 cm of the bronchial tree, major vessels, esophagus, heart, tracheal, pericardium, mediastinal pleural and brachial plexus and vertebral body, but having no direct invasion, Stage I (n = 82), and isolated recurrent (n = 19) NSCLC, were treated with image-guided SABR to 50 Gy in four fractions or 70 Gy in ten fractions. Toxicity was scored according to the CTCAE V3.0. Result(s): With a median follow-up period of 27.5 months (range, 9.0-81.8 months), the local control rates were 98.0%, 96.1% at 2 years and 3 years respectively. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 71.0% and 57.5%, respectively. Although the most common side effect was radiation pneumonitis (RP), there was no G4 or G5 RP with current dose volume constraints (40 Gy <1 cc for the bronchial tree). A total of 18.8% had G2 RP and 2.0% had G3 RP. Dosimetric factors V5- V20, mean lung dose (MLD) of ipsilateral lung were associated with RP on univariate analysis. Three percent developed radiation brachial plexus neuropathy; the maximum brachial plexus doses of these patients were 38- 43 Gy in 4 fractions. One patient, with tumor invading hilum who was treated with SABR 70 Gy in 10 fx to PTV, died from hemoptysis one year later. Analysis showed that significant portions of pulmonary vessels received doses of 70 to 80 GY. Conclusion(s): SABR for central lung tumors resulted in high local control and acceptable toxicity when appropriate dose volume constraints were applied. Keeping brachial tree/pulmonary vessel dose 40 Gy <1 cc in 4 fractions appears safe in avoiding G4 or 5 RP. Maximal dose >38 Gy in 4 fractions to the brachial plexus was associated with neuropathy. Severe toxicity could develop if large portions of the major vessel are exposed to 70 Gy or higher even in 10 fractions.",Excluded

2685,"Interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost: The feasibility and cosmetic outcome of a fractionated outpatient delivery scheme Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, potential toxicity, and cosmetic outcome of fractionated interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost for the management of patients with breast cancer at increased risk for local recurrence.Methods and Materials: From 1994 to 1996, 18 women with early stage breast cancer underwent conventionally fractionated whole breast radiotherapy (50-50.4 Gy) followed by interstitial HDR brachytherapy boost. All were considered to be at high risk for local failure. Seventeen had pathologically confirmed final surgical margins of less than 2 mm or focally positive. Brachytherapy catheter placement and treatment delivery were conducted on an outpatient basis. Preplanning was used to determine optimal catheter positions to enhance dose homogeneity of dose delivery. The total HDR boost dose was 15 Gy delivered in 6 fractions of 2.5 Gy over 3 days. Local control, survival, late toxicities (LENT-SOMA), and cosmetic outcome were recorded in follow-up. In addition, factors potentially influencing cosmesis were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The minimum follow-up is 40 months with a median 50 months. Sixteen patients were alive without disease at last follow-up. There have been no in-breast failures observed. One patient died with brain metastases, and another died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease. Grade 1-2 late toxicities included 39% with hyperpigmentation, 56% with detectable fibrosis, 28% with occasional discomfort, and 11% with visible telangiectasias. Grade 3 toxicity was reported in one patient as persistent discomfort. Sixty-seven percent of patients were considered to have experienced good/excellent cosmetic outcomes. Factors with a direct relationship to adverse cosmetic outcome were extent of surgical defect (p = 0.00001), primary excision volume (p = 0.017), and total excision volume (p = 0.015). Conclusion(s): For high risk patients who may benefit from increased doses, interstitial HDR brachytherapy provides a convenient outpatient method for boosting the lumpectomy cavity following conventional whole breast irradiation without overdosing normal tissues. The fractionation scheme of 15 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 days is well tolerated. The volume of tissue removed from the breast at lumpectomy appears to dominate cosmetic outcome in this group of patients. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: One hundred twenty-eight 45-day-old Wistar rats received whole brain fractionated radiation (30 Gy), whereas 48 rats received sham irradiation. Four irradiated subgroups were defined: saline, 37.5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 150 mg/kg Ethyol. Sequential behavioral studies including one-way and two-way avoidance tasks were undertaken before and after radiation. Result(s): Before radiation, the performances of all groups were similar. For the one-way avoidance task, at 1, 3, and 6 months postradiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (75 or 150 mg/kg) irradiated rats (p <= 0.001). Nevertheless, lower percentage of avoidance (p <= 0.001) was only seen at 1 month postradiation in saline-irradiated rats, after comparison with their preradiation values. For the two-way avoidance task, performed only after radiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (150 or 75 mg/kg) irradiated rats at 1, 2.5, 4.5, and 7.5 months (p = 0.000). Rats treated with Ethyol did not differ from sham-irradiated rats in both avoidance tasks, except for the 37.5 mg/kg-Ethyol group which showed lower performances 6 months postradiation (p = 0.005, one-way avoidance).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term cognitive profile and the incidence of dementia in a cohort of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated by STN-DBS. 57 consecutive patients were prospectively assessed by the mean of a neuropsychological battery over 3 years after surgery. Dementia (DSM-IV) and UPDRS I to IV were recorded. 24.5% of patients converted to dementia over 3 years (incidence of 89 of 1,000 per year). This group of patients cognitively continuously worsened over 3 years up to fulfilling dementia criteria (PDD). The rest of the cohort remained cognitively stable (PD) over the whole follow-up. Preoperative differences between PDD and PD included older age (69.2 +/- 5.8 years; 62.6 +/- 8 years), presence of hallucinations and poorer executive score (10.1 +/- 5.9; 5.5 +/- 4.4). The incidence of dementia over 3 years after STN-DBS is similar to the one reported in medically treated patients. The PDD presented preoperative risk factors of developing dementia similar to those described in medically treated patients. These observations suggest dementia being secondary to the natural evolution of PD rather than a direct effect of STN-DBS.",Excluded

Both diffusion tensor metrics and volumetric measures were analyzed in the brain regions involved in the visual function.RESULTS: The fractional anisotropy was reduced in the right posterior thalamic radiations (P = .0009) and remained significant after a false discovery rate (FDR) correction (P = .03). A trend of increase in the mean diffusivities of different subregions of the occipital cortex on the right side, including calcarine, middle occipital, inferior occipital, and fusiform gyri, was noted and became insignificant after FDR correction. Similarly, there was a trend of cortical thinning involving the right occipital lobe and bilateral fusiform gyri, volume reduction of the left thalamus, and increase in lateral ventricular volume in the postflight scans.CONCLUSION: Gray and white matter alterations are detected by quantitative MRI before and after space flight.

150,"Effect of microradiosurgical transections upon kainate seizure focus Multiple subpial transections (MST) sever horizontal intracortical fibers involved in the propagation of seizures, while preserving vertical fibers which are essential for brain function. Less damaging to the brain than a traditional resection,MST still exposes patients to the risks of craniotomy. Microradiosurgery uses synchrotron generated sub-millimetric beams of radiation. Arrays of tightly spaced microbeams produce a lethal effect only to those cells directly in the beam path. Low energy x-rays used for microradiosurgery have a small tissue half-value layer making the technique ideal for treating superficial brain lesions. Video-EEG (VEEG) data was recorded immediately following kainate injected into sensorimotor cortex. Rats then underwent irradiation with an array of parallel microbeams delivered to the seizure focus.Subclinical electrographic ictal events remained frequent up to 10 hours post irradiation. More prolonged seizures exhibited typical rat complex partial seizure semiologies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recording VEEG before and after precise microbeam irradiation from a synchrotron source; demonstrating a methodology which will be useful for future experiments serving to optimize microbeam doses and configuration in preparation for the treatment of epilepsy in humans. The results show some promise that microradiosurgical MST can limit the spread of seizures without causing clinically evident neurological damage.",Excluded

1924,"Severed corticospinal axons recover electrophysiologic control of muscle activity after x-ray therapy in lesioned adult spinal cord Mechanical injury to the adult mammalian spinal cord results in permanent loss of structural integrity at the lesion site and of the brain-controlled function distal to the lesion. Some of these consequences were permanently averted by altering the cellular constituents at the lesion site with x-irradiation delivered within a critical time window after injury. We have reported in a separate article that x-irradiation of sectioned adult rat spinal cord resulted in restitution of structural continuity and regrowth of severed corticospinal axons across and deep into the distal stump. Here, we report that after x-ray therapy of the lesion site severed corticospinal axons of transected adult rat spinal cord recover electrophysiologic control of activity of hindlimb muscles innervated by motoneurons distal to the lesion. The degree of recovery of control of muscle activity was directly related to the degree of restitution of structural integrity. This restitution of electrophysiologic function implies that the regenerating corticospinal axons reestablish connectivity with neurons within the target field in the distal stump. Our data suggest that recovery of structural continuity is a sufficient condition for the axotomized corticospinal neurons to regain some of their disrupted function in cord regions distal to the lesion site.",Included

Multimodality neurodiagnostic testing, including CT, MR imaging, xenon-enhanced CT, evoked potential studies, and analysis of CSF myelin basic protein levels, all of which eventually were correlated with neuropathologic examination, enabled detection of lesions produced with high-dose (150 Gy) radiosurgery as early as 6 weeks. Within the first 6 months after radiosurgery, lower doses (20 Gy, 50 Gy) did not result in clinically or neurodiagnostically detectable lesions. The rat arteriovenous fistula model permits analysis of the delayed histopathologic effects of radiosurgery on an experimentally created fistula designed to mimic an AVM. The rat C6 glioma model is designed to evaluate the effect of radiosurgery in an infiltrative tumor that simulates a human malignant brain tumor. These studies are intended eventually to increase our knowledge about the safety and efficacy of radiosurgery in both the normal and tumor-implanted brains.

However, research on the imaging performance of RION is not sufficient. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) early after injury of the optic nerve of rhesus monkeys by a single-dose/fractionation-scheme of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intraorbital optic nerve contour of 5 rhesus monkeys was acquired by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Then, the unilateral intraorbital optic nerves of 5 rhesus monkeys were injured by gamma knife surgery (GKS) with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve). DTI was performed before the irradiation and 1week, 2weeks, 4weeks, and 24weeks after injury to obtain the cross-sectional area, and the fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) values.RESULTS: The cross-sectional area of the injured optic nerve exhibited significant atrophy 24weeks after SRS. FA declined 1week after injury; this value then increased slightly but remained lower than before injury (P<0.05). AD began to decline in the 2weeks after injury and gradually disappeared (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: SRS with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve) on the unilateral intraorbital optic nerve can induce RION. DTI can detect RION at an early stage. FA and AD are useful indicators for RION diagnosis. In the early stage, the primary site of RION may be the vascular endothelium.",Included

We have examined disc shedding in eye cups kept in a complex tissue culture medium.

Light-evoked shedding did not occur in the standard medium with -20 mM sodium bicarbonate, but a large light-evoked response was consistently seen when medium bicarbonate was raised to 030 mM. In high-bicarbonate medium, light-evoked shedding was comparable in magnitude, size distribution of phagosomes, and time course to similar responses observed in intact animals. Preliminary analysis of culture conditions which support shedding suggests that bicarbonate ion concentration is of critical importance. However, lack of light-evoked shedding in a high-bicarbonate Ringer solution suggests that some additional unidentified factor(s) in the complex medium is also necessary.

3240,"Benefts of head tilting for brain PET-CT examinations The main goal of the current study is to think over the aspects of head positioning for brain examinations, focusing on mainly one field of view (FOV) PET/CT acquisitions. The image quality, radiation exposure of the eye lenses, streaking artefact due to the beam hardening of the skull, patient comfort, orientation of the reconstructed images were all considered in this study. Method(s): while the brain centered in the PET field of view, the degree of tilting the patient's chin toward to the chest were examined. Reconstructed CT images of anonymized patients were retrospectively evaluated. From the perspective of PET image quality the PET FOV on the CT image were simulated, then the number of significant voxels of the brain tissue close to the FOV boarders were plotted as a function of the tilt angle. On the same way the path of the radiation exposure in the brain were analysed. We introduced a simple wedge-shape insert placed under the head holder into our routine brain examinations according to our initial results. Patients were reported in connection with the comfort during the examination. Result(s): we found that the range of 20-25 degree is the optimal range to tilt the head toward to the chest. As a result of tilting the head, the reconstructed axial slices for both the CT and the PET are ft for supra orbito-meatalis line. It decreases the asymmetries caused by wrong orientation, and can take unnecessary the reorientation of the images as a post-processing step, prior the medical reporting. In most cases it results that the eyes are out of the CT scan range, which is particularly important, since the eyes have high risk for radiation exposure. The location of CT streaking artefacts moves down to the direction of cerebellum. In general because the tilting of the head, the perpendicular projection of the brain to the scan axis is significantly shorter, which means 10-15% dose reduction. Furthermore the noise-as a result of the low sensitivity of PET on the FOV boarders-has smaller effect on the diagnostic value of reconstructed PET image. There is no noticeable advantage or disadvantage related to the patient comfort. Conclusion(s): tilting the head with 20-25 degree results an overall improvement in image quality and dose reduction.

Spheroids on day-20 with 350 microm diameters were treated with 20 microM resveratrol and/or 6 mM methoxyamine and/or 1 microM iododeoxyuridine for one volume doubling time (67 h), and then irradiated with 2 Gy gamma-radiation ((60)Co) in different groups. After treatment, viability of the cells, colony forming ability and DNA damages were obtained by blue dye exclusion, colony formation and alkaline comet assay, respectively. Our results showed that methoxyamine and resveratrol could significantly reduce colony number and induce the DNA damages of glioblastoma spheroid cells treated with iododeoxyuridine in combination with gamma-rays. Therefore, methoxyamine as base excision repair inhibitor and resveratrol as hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha inhibitor in combination with iododeoxyuridine as radiosensitizer enhanced the radiosensitization of glioblastoma spheroid cells.",Excluded
1611,"Increased seroreactivity to glioma-expressed antigen 2 in brain tumor patients under radiation BACKGROUND: Surgery and radiation are the mainstays of therapy for human gliomas that are the most common primary brain tumors. Most recently, cell culture and animal studies provided the first convincing evidence that radiation not only eliminates tumor cells, but also modulates the immune response and likely improves anti-tumor immunotherapy.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present an in vivo study that analyzes the effects of radiation on the immune response in tumor patients. As readout system, we utilized the reactivity of glioma patients' sera against antigen GLEA2 as the most frequent antigen immunogenic in glioblastoma patients. We established an ELISA assay to analyze reactivity of 24 glioblastoma patients over a period of several months. As control we used 30 sera from healthy donors as well as 30 sera from lung cancer patients. We compared the course of GLEA2 seroreactivity at different times prior, during and after radiation. The GLEA2 seroreactivity was increased by the time of surgery, decreased after surgery, increased again under radiation, and slightly decreased after radiation.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide in vivo evidence for an increased antibody response against tumor antigens under radiation. Antigens that become immunogenic with an increased antibody response as result of radiation can serve as ideal targets for immunotherapy of human tumors.",Excluded
2688,"Quantifying visual pathway axonal and myelin loss in neuromyelitis optic OBJECTIVE: To determine how optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures reflecting the health of neurons (total macular volume, TMV) and axons (retinal nerve fibre layer, RNFL) relate to MRI-derived measures of myelin (myelin water fraction, MWF) in the optic radiation (OR) of individuals with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) compared to healthy controls. BACKGROUND: NMO is an autoimmune disorder characterized by episodes of inflammation and damage to astrocytes that can result in optic neuritis (ON) and transverse myelitis. The optic nerve is a frequent site for demyelination resulting in visual dysfunction which may be reflected by OCT measures of axonal health and MWF of the OR. DESIGN/METHODS: 8 eyes with ON (NMO<sup>1</sup>) and 12 eyes without ON (NMO<sup>2</sup>) from ten NMO patients (EDSS 2.06.0, mean age=43y, 3M/7F) and 24 eyes of twelve healthy subjects (mean age=31y, 3M/9F) were included. OCT assessment involved a Macular Volume protocol (volume of retina in the center 6mm of the macula) and a RNFL Thickness scan (3.4mm ring scan of retinal thickness around optic nerve). The MRI protocol included a 32-echo T2-relaxation GRASE sequence. Average MWF values were calculated within the OR. RESULT(S): RNFL thickness (NMO<sup>1</sup>:70.5+/-17.9mum; NMO<sup>2</sup>:91.3+/-8.7mum; controls:102.9+/-15.0mum) was reduced in NMO<sup>1</sup> compared to NMO<sup>2</sup> (p=0.01) and controls (p<0.0001). TMV (NMO<sup>1</sup>:7.9+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>; NMO<sup>2</sup>:8.4+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>; controls:8.9+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>) was reduced in NMO<sup>1</sup> compared to NMO<sup>2</sup> (p=0.02) and controls (p<0.0001). Also NMO<sup>2</sup> had reduced TMV compared to controls (p=0.02). Decreased OR MWF was also observed in NMO (NMO:0.098+/-0.01; controls:0.11+/-0.01, p=0.02). There was a strong correlation between the OR MWF and RNFL (r=0.50,p=0.003) and TMV (r=0.60,p=0.0002). CONCLUSION(S): The correspondence between reductions in OCT measures of neuronal and axonal health in the anterior visual pathway and MRI-based measures of myelin health in the posterior visual pathway suggests that these measures may be used to evaluate disease progression and treatment approaches that promote repair.",Excluded

Under hypothermia, the protein-synthesizing system was shown to be damaged to a lesser degree and to be restored faster in comparison with similar neurons in rats irradiated at room temperature. In rats irradiated under hypothermia, the rRNA biogenesis and the protein-synthesizing activity of polyribosomes were restored in two days. The protective influence of hypothermia did not spread to changes in membrane structures (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgy apparatus); i.e., a partial loss of integrity and possible transformation of their structure caused by the irradiation and the restoration of these structures occurred at a lower rate.",Included
1908,"NF-kappa B signaling pathway as a target for human tumor radiosensitization NF-kappa B is a critical nuclear transcriptional factor that is activated in response to cellular stresses and regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and cell death. When regulated NF-kappa B activation is disrupted, cells undergo apoptosis. That is, constitutively elevated or dysregulated NF-kappa B activation leads to cell death in response to stress. These mechanisms have been shown experimentally by expressing dominant negative inhibitors of NF-kappa B (I kappa B-alpha) in cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutic agents or to ionizing radiation. NF-kappa B also plays an important role in a novel, radiation-inducible signaling pathway that involves the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase. Cells from patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation and exhibit impaired NF-kappa B activation in response to this stress. Restoration of NF-kappa B regulation in AT fibroblasts by introducing a dominant negative form of I kappa B-alpha has resulted in correction of radiation sensitivity and a reduction of ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. Expression of introduced ATM in AT cells results in correction of NF-kappa B regulation and an increase in postradiation survival without reduction in radiation-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these observations support a central role for NF-kappa B regulation in cellular intrinsic radiation sensitivity and apoptosis after exposure to ionizing radiation. Therefore, we hypothesize that the signaling pathway involving ATM/NF-kappa B/I kappa B offers attractive potential molecular targets for radiation sensitization in strategies to enhance the therapeutic ratio in cancer treatment.",Excluded

The brains of embryos on day 17 and offspring at 2, 3 and 8 weeks after birth were processed for BrdU immunohistochemistry to trace the movements of BrdU-labeled cells. The location of BrdU-labeled neurons in the cerebral cortex was quantitatively analyzed between irradiated animals and non-irradiated controls. We have demonstrated that the initial migration of BrdU-labeled cells from the matrix cell zone towards the cortical plate during embryonic periods was decelerated when exposed to X-rays of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Gy on embryonic day 14, and that aberrantly placed neurons in the cerebral neocortex were noted in younger animals that were irradiated prenatally, whereas such derangement was less pronounced in mature animals.

3396,"Helium CT: Monte Carlo simulation results for an ideal source and detector with comparison to proton CT Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of relative stopping power and spatial resolution of images reconstructed with simulated helium CT (HeCT) in comparison to proton CT (pCT). Method(s): A Monte Carlo (MC) study with the TOPAS tool was performed to compare the accuracy of relative stopping power (RSP) reconstruction and spatial resolution of low-fluence HeCT to pCT, both using 200 MeV/u particles. An ideal setup consisting of a flat beam source and a totally absorbing energy-range detector was implemented to estimate the theoretically best achievable RSP accuracy for the calibration and reconstruction methods currently used for pCT. The phantoms imaged included a cylindrical water phantom with inserts of different materials, sizes, and positions, a Catphan phantom with a module containing high-contrast line pairs (CTP528) and a module with cylindrical inserts of different RSP (CTP404), as well as a voxelized 10-year-old female phantom. Dose to the cylindrical water phantom was also calculated. The RSP accuracy was studied for all phantoms except the CTP528 module. The latter was used for the estimation of the spatial resolution, evaluated as the modulation transfer function (MTF) at 10%. Result(s): An overall error under 0.5% was achieved for HeCT for the water phantoms with the different inserts, in all cases better than that for pCT, in some cases by a factor 3. The inserts in the CTP404 module were reconstructed with an average RSP accuracy of 0.3% for HeCT and 0.2% for pCT. Anatomic structures (brain, bones, air cavities, etc.) in the digitized head phantom were well recognizable and no artifacts were visible with both HeCT and pCT. The three main tissue materials (soft tissue, brain, and cranium) were well identifiable in the reconstructed RSP-volume distribution with both imaging modalities. Using 360 projection angles, the spatial resolution was 4 lp/cm for HeCT and 3 lp/cm for pCT. Generally, spatial resolution increased with the number of projection angles and was always higher for HeCT than for pCT for the same number of projections. When HeCT and pCT scan were performed to deliver the same dose in the phantom, the resolution for HeCT was higher than pCT. Conclusion(s): MC simulations were used to compare HeCT and pCT image reconstruction. HeCT images had similar or better RSP accuracy and higher spatial resolution compared to pCT. Further investigation of the potential of helium ion imaging is warranted. Copyright Â© 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",Excluded

2694,"Monitoring of mental performance during spaceflight Mental performance of astronauts during spaceflight may suffer from both direct effects of microgravity on perceptual, cognitive, and psychomotor processes, and unspecific stress effects on these functions due to high workload sleep disturbances, or the general burden of adapting to the extreme living conditions in space. Early detection of any signs of mental performance impairments seems to be essential for mission success and to prevent obvious performance decrements in critical mission tasks. One possible approach to this problem is to assess the astronaut's performance on specific screening tests repeatedly during a space mission and to compare the results with a self-referenced baseline established pre-flight. The selection of screening tests for this purpose should be guided by three different criteria: 1) their reliability; 2) their sensitivity (i.e., their power to reveal subtle mental performance changes induced by internal or external stressors during spaceflight); and 3) their diagnosticity (i.e., their capability to reveal the underlying processes that lead to these performance deficits). Based on a discussion of these theoretical issues, first attempts to monitor mental performance of astronauts during spaceflight by means of short-term laboratory tasks are reviewed. The results of these studies suggest that, in particular, perceptual-motor tasks (tracking) and tasks placing comparatively high demands on attentional processes (e.g., dual-tasks) represent sensitive monitoring measures. First studies on the diagnositicity of tracking performance decrements during spaceflight suggest that they reflect both microgravity-related changes in the sensory-motor system as well as unspecific stress-effects, with the former factor reflected primarily in tracking performance decrements during early adaptation to the microgravity environment.

This U.S. National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) analysis was performed to improve the evidence guiding decision-making regarding postoperative therapy for early stage LCNEC. Method(s): Overall survival of patients with pathologic T1-2aN0 LCNEC who underwent resection in the NCDB from 2003 to 2015 was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis. Patients who died within 30 days of surgery were excluded. These prospective data were acquired by certified tumor registrars, and include over 80% of cancer diagnoses annually in the U.S. Result(s): Of the 5,177 patients who met study criteria, adjuvant therapy was given to 31% of patients (n=1585): 20% received chemotherapy (n=1039), 8% chemoradiation (n=400), and 3% radiation (n=146).

Exposure either to the head or the whole body to 10 Gy induced hyperthermia, while body-only exposure produced hypothermia. This observation indicates that radiation-induced fever is a result of a direct effect on the brain. The hyperthermia due to 10 Gy was significantly attenuated by the pre- or post-treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Hyperthermia was also altered by the central administration of a mu-receptor antagonist naloxone but only at low doses of radiation. These findings suggest that radiation-induced hyperthermia may be mediated through the synthesis and release of prostaglandins in the brain and to a lesser extent to the release of endogenous opioid peptides. The release of histamine acting on H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> receptors may be involved in radiation-induced hypothermia, since both the H<inf>1</inf> receptor antagonist, mepyramine, and H<inf>2</inf> receptor antagonist, cimetidine, antagonized the hypothermia. The results of these studies suggest that the release of neurohumoral substances induced by exposure to ionizing radiation is dose dependent and has different consequences on physiological processes such as the regulation of body temperature.

3039,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for jugular foramen schwannomas BACKGROUND: Jugular foramen schwannomas pose difficult management problems because of the surgical risk of lower cranial neuropathy. The indications and results of stereotactic radiosurgery are not well documented.METHODS: We reviewed our 10-year experience in the management of 17 patients who had jugular foramen schwannomas managed with the gamma knife. Thirteen patients previously had undergone surgery (range, 1-6 resections). Four patients had multiple cranial nerve deficits before microsurgical resection; 12 developed multiple lower cranial nerve palsies after resection. Four patients underwent radiosurgery based on imaging criteria alone. Conformal dose planning (tumor margin dose of 12-18 Gy) successfully encompassed the irregular tumor volumes in all patients.RESULTS: Follow-up varied from 6 to 74 months. Tumor size decreased in eight patients, remained stable in eight, and increased in one patient during the average follow-up interval of 3.5 years. Six patients improved and 10 others retained their preradiosurgery clinical status. One patient had an increase in tumor size and clinical deterioration 6 months after radiosurgery and underwent microsurgical resection. No patient developed new cranial nerve or other neurological deficits after radiosurgery.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that gamma knife radiosurgery is an effective alternative to microsurgical resection for patients who have small tumors and intact lower cranial nerve function.

Despite continued advances in both planning techniques and treatment delivery, the standard workflow has remained relatively unchanged, often requiring 1 to 3 weeks and resulting in patient inconvenience and delayed palliation. We developed an expedited method wherein computed tomography simulation, treatment planning, quality assurance, and treatment delivery are performed in 1 day. This prospective pilot clinical trial evaluates the safety, efficacy, and patient satisfaction of this rapid workflow.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with 1 to 3 painful bone metastases were prospectively enrolled and treated with 1 fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy, using a same-day Scan-Plan-QA-Treat workflow, termed STAT RAD, in a phase 1/2 dose escalation trial from 8 Gy to 15 Gy per fraction. Bone pain, opioid use, patient satisfaction, performance status, and quality of life were evaluated before and at 1, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after treatment. Outcomes and treatment-related toxicity were analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were enrolled, and 46 patients with 60 bone metastases were treated per the protocol. Partial or greater pain response occurred in 50% of patients at 1 week, 75% of patients at 8 weeks, 68.7% of patients at 6 months, and 33.3% of patients at 12 months. There were 2 grade-3 toxicities, including 1 spinal fracture associated with disease progression and hyperbilirubinemia. Reirradiation was required in 16.7% of treated lesions at a median time to retreatment of 4.9 months. Most patient responses (78.6%) indicated that patients would choose this workflow again.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that treating bone metastases with palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy via a single-fraction, patient-centric workflow is feasible and safe with doses up to 15 Gy. However, pain response decreased at 12 months and was associated with a 16.7% retreatment rate, which suggests that further dose escalation is warranted.",Excluded

The AEDs' adverse effects are common in these patients and can negatively influence their perceptions of their QoL. We conducted an observational pilot study in patients with brain tumor-related epilepsy to verify efficacy, tolerability, and impact on QoL and global neurocognitive performances of zonisamide (ZNS) in add-on.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 13 patients (5 females, 8 males; mean age, 49.6 years) presenting uncontrolled seizures. At first visit and at final follow-up at 6 months, patients underwent neurological examination, evaluation of adverse events, and cognitive and QoL tests. A seizure diary was given.RESULTS: Eight patients underwent chemotherapy, 3 underwent radiotherapy, and 5 had disease progression. Mean dosage of ZNS at final follow-up was 300 mg/d.Of 9 patients who reached the sixth month follow-up, the mean weekly seizure number before ZNS had been 3.2 +/- 5.0, and at final follow-up, the mean weekly seizure number was 0.18 +/- 0.41 (P = 0.05). Compared with baseline, we observed stability in all cognitive domains, except for verbal fluency that significantly worsened. Results on QoL tests showed that QoL remained unchanged over time, which could indicate that ZNS did not influence the patients' perceived QoL.CONCLUSIONS: Zonisamide as add-on in our patients seems to be well tolerated and efficacious in controlling seizures. Despite having limitations represented by the fact that our study is observational, with a small study population and a short follow-up period, our results confirm that when choosing an AED, in addition to efficacy, the drug's effect on patients' QoL also needs to be considered, especially for patients facing many psychosocial challenges, such as those with brain tumor-related epilepsy.",Excluded

Complete and partial response in both groups was comparable, and the overall survival was comparable. However, relapse-free survival was significantly higher in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and irradiation in comparison with the radiotherapy alone group. Disease-free survival was higher in the concomitant chemotherapy-radiotherapy patients, although survival was not significantly modified, probably because of suboptimal chemotherapy. The initial intrathoracic failure rate was 40.7% inthe concomitant chemotherapy-irradiation group, compared with 53.8% in the radiotherapy-alone patients. None of the patients receiving delayed chemotherapy following the radiotherapy recurrence showed significant tumor response to the drugs. The incidence of distant metastasis was slightly lower in the chemotherapy groups. Brain metastases were noted in 7% of the patients in both groups. Increased intrathoracic recurrences were noted in patients with lower doses of irradiation. Nine of 13 patients treated with inadequate portals developed intrathoracic recurrences in comparison to 13 of 40 treated with adequate irradiation fields.

2556,"[Sensitivity to glare before and after Nd:YAG capsulotomy. Comparison between small and large capsulotomy] AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to determine whether capsulotomy size influences visual performance.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty eyes were included in this study and were divided into two groups: 10 eyes had small central capsulotomies without dilating the pupil, and 10 eyes had large capsulotomies through dilated pupils. We measured both, visual acuity and glare due to forward light scatter using a computer system.RESULTS: Following treatment both groups had equally significant (< 0.001) improvements in visual acuity. However, a significant (p < 0.001) improvement of glare due to forward light scatter was only observed in the eyes with a large size capsulotomy.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that measurements of forward light scatter are more sensitive than visual acuity testing in demonstrating loss of visual performance in patients with media opacities. It is recommended that pupils are dilated prior to Nd:YAG capsulotomy if forward light scatter from capsule remnants and the subsequent glare disability are to be minimised.",Excluded
2848,"Tissue slice cultures from humans or rodents: a new tool to evaluate biological effects of heavy ions The aim of this interdisciplinary project is to establish slice culture preparations from rodents and humans as a new model system for studying effects of X-rays and heavy ions within normal and tumor tissues. The advantage of such slice cultures relies on the conservation of an organotypic environment, the easy treatment and observation by live-imaging microscopy, and the independence from genetic immortalization strategies used to generate cell lines. Rat brains as well as human tumors were cut into 300-mum-thick sections and cultivated in an incubator in a humidified atmosphere at 37 degrees C. This is realized by a membrane-based culture system with a liquid-air interface. With this system, it is possible to keep rodent slices viable for several months. Human brain tumor slices remained vital for at least 21 days. Slices were irradiated with X-rays at the radiation facility of the University Hospital in Frankfurt/Main at doses up to 40 Gy. Heavy ion irradiations were performed at GSI (Darmstadt) with different ions, energies, and doses.

This study evaluated biochemical impairments related to the oxidative stress induced by UVA, UVB and UVA. +. UVB (solar simulator-SIM) in environmental doses, during five consecutive days of exposure, in the brain and eyestalk of the crab Ucides cordatus. We evaluated these regions by sampling on the 1st, 3rd and 5th days of UV exposure for lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidant capacity against the peroxyl radical (ACAP), and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione-. S-transferase (GST). Immunohistochemical and immunoblotting assays were performed for anti-activated-caspase 3 in the brains. After the first day of exposure, LPO increased in the eyestalks and brains of the UV-exposed animals; ACAP, and CAT, GPX and GST activities also increased in the brains. On the third day, the LPO values in the eyestalk remained high in the UV-exposed groups, while ACAP decreased in the brain and eyestalk and CAT activity remained high in all irradiated groups in both regions. On the fifth day, LPO decreased in the eyestalk and brain of the UV-exposed groups. These results may have been a consequence of the antioxidant defense system (ADS) activity, since CAT activity was high in both regions, ACAP was high in the eyestalks of the SIM group, and GPX activity remained high in the eyestalks of the UVA and UVB groups. Immunohistochemical assays and immunoblotting showed that there was apoptosis in the brains of the UV-exposed crabs.

Two types of tissue of particular concern that may receive considerable doses during such procedures are the lens of the eye and the brain. Ocular radiation exposure results in lens changes that, with time, may progress to partial or total lens opacification (cataracts). In the early stages, such opacities do not result in visual disability; the severity of such changes tends to increase progressively with dose and time until vision is impaired and cataract surgery is required. Scattered radiation doses to the eye lens of an interventional cardiologist in typical working conditions can exceed 34 muGy min<sup>-1</sup> in high-dose fluoroscopy modes and 3 muGy per image during image acquisition (instantaneous rate values) when radiation protection tools are not used. A causal relation between exposure to ionising radiation and increased risk of brain and central nervous system tumours has been shown in a number of studies. Although absorbed doses to the brain in interventional cardiology procedures are lower than those to the eye lens by a factor between 3.40 and 8.08 according to our simulations, doses to both tissues are among the highest occupational radiation doses documented for medical staff whose work involves exposures to x-rays.

The Abeta42 fibril-specific red-shift in the absorption spectra of TC responsible for the observed colorimetric optical output has been attributed to micro-environment change around the probe from hydrophilic-like to hydrophobic-like nature.

Reactive oxygen species are implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders because of higher vulnerability of neuronal tissues. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the role of melatonin against high-LET (linear energy transfer) (56)Fe particle irradiation-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the mouse cerebellum. Radiation-induced oxidative damage was examined using a neuronal-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL), quantitative histopathology, DNA damage (comet assay), carbonyl content and 4-HAE + MDA (4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde) status of the cerebellum. Radiation exposure augmented the number of TUNEL positive cell, DNA migration in the comet tail and carbonyl and 4-HAE + MDA level in the cerebellum. Melatonin pretreatment significantly inhibited the oxidative damage to biomolecules as well as cerebellar apoptosis. Melatonin-treated irradiated mice showed higher counts of intact Purkinje cells as compared to vehicle-treated irradiated mice.

In addition, two different forms of ionizing radiation (gamma-rays and protons) were utilized. Body and spleen mass, leukocyte blastogenesis, and flow cytometry analysis of cell populations in blood and spleen were performed to detect toxicity, if any, and to identify mechanisms that may correlate with the anti-tumor action of combination therapy. C6 tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice and allowed to become established before treatment initiation. pGL1-TNF-alpha was injected into the implanted tumors, which were then irradiated 16-18 hr later; each modality was administered three times over 8-9 days. The addition of pGL1-TNF-alpha significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of radiation (p < 0.05). The effect was more than additive, since pGL1-TNF-alpha alone did not slow tumor progression and radiation alone had only a modest effect. Administration of pGL1-TNF-alpha together with proton radiation resulted in tumor volumes that were 23% smaller than those following pGL1-TNF-alpha + gamma-ray treatment; a similar differential in tumor size was observed in the groups receiving only radiation. Body weights and blood and spleen cell analyses did not reveal treatment-related toxicity. High basal proliferation of blood leukocytes and increased B cell levels in the spleen were associated with pGL1-TNF-alpha + 60Co (gamma-radiation) or proton treatment. Overall, the results suggest that the pGL1-TNF-alpha/radiation combination is effective and safe under the conditions employed. This is the first study to combine gene and proton radiation therapy and to show, under controlled experimental conditions, that proton radiation may have a greater effect against malignant tumors compared to the same physical dose of gamma-radiation.",Excluded
3078,"Diminished neuronal activity increases neuron-neuron connectivity underlying silent synapse formation and the rapid conversion of silent to functional synapses Neuronal activity regulates the synaptic strength of neuronal networks. However, it is still unclear how diminished activity changes connection patterns in neuronal circuits. To address this issue, we analyzed neuronal connectivity and relevant mechanisms using hippocampal cultures in which developmental synaptogenesis had occurred. We show that diminution of network activity in mature neuronal circuit promotes reorganization of neuronal circuits via NR2B subunit-containing NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NR2B-NMDARs), which mediate silent synapse formation. Simultaneous double whole-cell recordings revealed that diminishing neuronal circuit activity for 48 h increased the number of synaptically connected neuron pairs with both silent and functional synapses. This increase was accompanied by the specific expression of NR2B-NMDARs at synaptic sites. Analysis of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) showed that the frequency of NMDAR-mediated, but not AMPAR-mediated, mEPSCs increased, indicating that diminished neuronal activity promotes silent synapse formation via the surface delivering NR2B-NMDARs in mature neurons. After activation of neuronal circuit by releasing from TTX blockade (referred as circuit reactivation), the frequency of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs increased instead, and this increase was prevented by ifenprodil. The circuit reactivation also caused an increased colocalization of glutamate receptor 1-specfic and synaptic NR2B-specific puncta. These results indicate that the circuit reactivation converts rapidly silent synapses formed during activity suppression to functional synapses. These data may provide a new example of homeostatic circuit plasticity that entails the modulation of neuron-neuron connectivity by synaptic activity.",Excluded

3558,"Adenosine A2A receptors are essential for long-term potentiation of NMDA-EPSCs at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses The physiological conditions under which adenosine A2A receptors modulate synaptic transmission are presently unclear. We show that A2A receptors are localized postsynaptically at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells and are essential for a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA-EPSCs induced by short bursts of mossy fiber stimulation. This LTP spares AMPA-EPSCs and is likely induced and expressed postsynaptically. It depends on a postsynaptic Ca2+ rise, on G protein activation, and on Src kinase. In addition to A2A receptors, LTP of NMDA-EPSCs requires the activation of NMDA and mGluR5 receptors as potential sources of Ca2+ increase. LTP of NMDA-EPSCs displays a lower threshold for induction as compared with the conventional presynaptic mossy fiber LTP; however, the two forms of LTP can combine with stronger induction protocols. Thus, postsynaptic A2A receptors may potentially affect information processing in CA3 neuronal networks and memory performance.",Excluded
1272,"Intraoperative radiotherapy electron boost in advanced and recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma: a retrospective study BACKGROUND: Relapses of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) have a poor prognosis and are almost always fatal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome and toxicity of intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IOERT) in advanced and recurrent EOC.METHODS: Forty-five women with EOC were treated with IOERT. Twenty-five patients had primary disease (PD) without distant metastasis at IOERT, and 20 patients had an isolated local recurrence (ILR) after surgery. All 45 patients in this series underwent optimal cytoreductive (<= 1 cm) surgery. The whole pelvic (WP) radiotherapy was intraoperatively delivered using 12 Mev electron beam; 43 patients received 18-20 Gy and two patients received 10 Gy. Thirty-three patients received postoperateive intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy, while seven patients received intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. Five patients refused concurrent chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Tumor recurrence and metastasis were observed in 16 patients (35.6%). Of those, 14 patients (31.1%) relapsed and two patients (4.4%) had distant metastasis alone. Eight of 25 (32%) local failures were observed in the PD group, as compared to 6/20 (30%) in the ILR group (P = 0.885). Actuarial local control at five year follow-up was 31/45 (68.9%). Seventeen of the total 45 (37.8%) patients died. Nine of 25 (36%) in the PD group died, as compared to 8 of 20 (40%) in the ILR group. The 5-year OS and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 28/45 (62.2%) and 25/45 (55.6%), respectively. In the PD group, the 5-year OS and DFS rates were 16/25 (64%) and 14/25 (56%) (P > 0.05, vs. the ILR group at 12/20 and 11/20, respectively). The OS and DFS in the IOERT plus IP group were 25/33 (75.8%) and 23/33 (69.7%), respectively, which were superior to the rates achieved with IOERT plus IV chemotherapy (P < 0.05, 2/7 and 1/7, respectively). The major complication of IOERT was neuropathy. Five (11.1%) patients developed peripheral neurotoxicity.CONCLUSIONS: IOERT may be feasible and effective as a boosting technique for advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer. IOERT plus IP chemotherapy may achieve high locoregional disease control and survival benefit with a low risk of toxicity.

2873,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma OBJECT Systemic control of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has substantially improved with the development of VEGF, mTOR, and checkpoint inhibitors. The current first-line standard of care is a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate the response to radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong the time to salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy or second-line systemic therapy. As the prevalence of mRCC has increased, the utilization of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment with SRS and TKIs remain largely undefined. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the safety and efficacy of TKIs when delivered concurrently with SRS. The authors hypothesized that first-line TKIs delivered concurrently with SRS significantly increase local control compared with SRS alone or TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing spine SRS for mRCC was conducted. Patients undergoing SRS were divided into 4 cohorts: those receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), and patients who were undergoing SRS with (C) or without (D) concurrent TKI treatment after failure of first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) was also included, consisting of patients with spinal metastases managed with TKIs alone. The primary outcome was 12-month local failure, defined as any in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to determine the independent effect of concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure. RESULTS One hundred patients who underwent 151 spine SRS treatments (232 vertebral levels) were included. At the time of SRS, 46% were receiving concurrent TKI therapy. In each SRS cohort, the median prescription dose was 16 Gy in 1 fraction. Patients in Cohort A had the highest burden of epidural disease (96%, p < 0.01). At 12 months, the cumulative incidence of local failure was 4% in Cohort A, compared with 19%-27% in Cohorts B-D and 57% in Cohort E (p < 0.01). Multivariate competing risks regression demonstrated that concurrent first-line TKI treatment (Cohort A) was independently associated with a local control benefit (HR 0.21, p = 0.04). In contrast, patients treated with TKIs alone (Cohort E) experienced an increased rate of local failure (HR 2.43, p = 0.03). No toxicities of Grade 3 or greater occurred following SRS with concurrent TKI treatment, and the incidence of post-SRS vertebral fracture (overall 21%) and pain flare (overall 17%) were similar across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis for patients with mRCC has significantly improved with TKIs. The present investigation suggests a local control benefit with the addition of concurrent first-line TKI therapy to spine SRS. These results have implications in the oligometastatic setting and support a body of preclinical radiobiological research.",Included

1692,"""Critical periods"" in vestibular development or adaptation of gravity sensory systems to altered gravitational conditions? 1. A feature of sensory, neuronal and motor systems is the existence of a critical period during their development. Modification of environmental conditions during this specific period of life affects development in a long-term manner, or even irreversibly. Deprivation is the prefered approach to study the existence and duration of critical periods. For gravity sensory systems, space flights offer the only opportunity for deprivation conditions. 2. Studies in a fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) and an amphibian (Xenopus laevis) revealed a significant sensitivity of their roll-induced static vestibuloocular reflex (rVOR) to a 9- to 10-day gravity deprivation (microgravity) during a spaceflight. In some instances, the rVOR was augmented after the flight as demonstrated in young Oreochromis which were launched when their rVOR had not been developed, and in Xenopus tadpoles launched after their rVOR had developed. Fish which could perform the rVOR at launch were insensitive to microgravity exposure. A similar insensitivity to microgravity was observed in Xenopus tadpoles with normal body shape which had not yet developed their rVOR at launch. Some tadpoles, however, developed an upward bended tail during their space flight; their rVOR was significantly depressed after termination of microgravity independent of the age at onset of the flight. Hypergravity depressed the rVOR for all so far tested developmental stages in both Oreochromis and Xenopus. 3. Both adaptive processes during exposure to altered gravity as well as the existence of a critical period in vestibular development might be responsible for the modulation of the rVOR recorded after exposure to altered gravity. Deprivation studies have to be extended to older developmental stages to test the possibility of a critical period; however, this approach is limited due to the low number of space flights.

We proposed the systematic investigation of dose reduction in contrast-enhanced MRA, hypothesizing heightened tolerance at 3 T vs 1.5 T. Quantitative and qualitative features were compared between full-dose and 50%-reduced dose examinations at 1.5 T and 3 T.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight cervical contrast-enhanced MRA examinations were reviewed for qualitative and quantitative (signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) features across four dose-field strength combinations: 1.5 T, 0.05 mmol/kg; 3 T, 0.05 mmol/kg; 1.5 T, 0.1 mmol/kg; and 3 T, 0.1 mmol/kg. Quantitative features were evaluated among the following segments: aortic arch, common carotid arteries, common carotid bifurcations, and cervical internal carotid arteries. A qualitative visual rating scale was applied for the same segments as well as to the vertebral arteries along their proximal (V1), intraforaminal (V2), and distal extraforaminal (V3) courses. Significant between-group differences were reported at p < 0.05.RESULTS: Qualitatively good arteriography was observed in all segments for all protocols. No significant qualitative differences between protocols were noted throughout evaluation of the anterior cervical circulation. Significant qualitative differences were observed only for V2 and V3 segments at half-dose 1.5-T compared with the remaining protocols (p < 0.05). No significant quantitative differences were present between full-dose and dose-reduced 3-T MRA in any segment. At 1.5 T, significant decrement in SNR and CNR at half-dose was present only within the cervical internal carotid artery.CONCLUSION: Dose reduction in cervical contrast-enhanced MRA is feasible at 3 T without significant compromise in arteriographic quality in most segments.

To determine whether the defect in UV61 is the hamster equivalent of Cockayne's syndrome, the RNA polymerase II transcription and DNA repair characteristics of a repair-proficient CHO cell line (AA8), UV61 and a CSB transfectant of UV61 were compared. In each cell line, formation and removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) were measured in the individual strands of the actively transcribed DHFR gene and in a transcriptionally inactive region downstream of DHFR. AA8 cells efficiently remove CPDs from the transcribed strand, but not from either the non-transcribed strand or the inactive region. There was no detectable repair of CPDs in any region of the genome in UV61. Transfection of the human CSB gene into UV61 restores the normal repair pattern (CPD removal in only the transcribed strand), demonstrating that the DNA repair defect in UV61 is homologous to that in Cockayne's syndrome (complementation group B) cells.

207,"Differential responses to NMDA receptor activation in rat hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells may underlie enhanced pyramidal cell vulnerability Hippocampal interneurons are generally more resistant than pyramidal cells to excitotoxic insults. Because NMDA receptors play a crucial role in neurodegeneration, we have compared the response to exogenous NMDA in CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons of the stratum oriens using combined whole-cell patch-clamp recording and ratiometric Ca2+ imaging. In voltage-clamp, current-clamp or in nominally Mg2+-free medium, NMDA (10 microM; 3-5 min exposure in the presence of tetrodotoxin) induced a markedly larger inward current and Ca2+ rise in pyramidal cells than in interneurons. Pyramidal cells also showed a more pronounced voltage dependence in their response to NMDA. We hypothesized that this enhanced response to NMDA receptor activation in pyramidal cells could underlie their increased vulnerability to excitotoxicity. Using loss of dye as an indicator of degenerative membrane disruption, interneurons tolerated continuous exposure to a high concentration of NMDA (30 microM) for longer periods than pyramidal cells. This acute neurodegeneration in pyramidal cells was independent of intracellular Ca2+, because high intracellular BAPTA (20 mM) did not prolong survival time. Thus, a plausible explanation for the enhanced sensitivity of pyramidal neurons to excitotoxic insults associated with cerebral ischemia is their greater response to NMDA receptor activation, which may reflect differences in NMDA receptor expression and/or subunit composition.",Excluded

Rats were exposed to ionizing radiation, super-high frequency, hypoxia, hyperoxia, vibration and acceleration (applied separately or in combination) which have been traditionally in the focus of space and aviation medicine. Brain interneuronal junctions were found to be very sensitive to the above effects, particularly ionizing radiation and hypoxia. Conversely, synapses were shown to be highly resistant to short-term hyperoxia and electromagnetic radiation. When combined effects were used, responses of interneuronal junctions depended on the irradiation dose and order of application of radiation and other flight factors.",Included

2301,"Characterization of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) brain-type fatty acid binding protein (fabp7) genes reveals the fates of teleost fabp7 genes following whole genome duplications Whole genome duplications (WGDs) are considered to have been a driving force in the generation of evolutionary diversity that is characteristic of higher eukaryotes. The ancestor of salmonids underwent two additional WGDs compared to mammals, one (3R) at the base of the teleost radiation and another (4R) in the common ancestor of extant salmonids. We have chosen the fatty acid binding protein (fabp) gene family as a model to study the fate of duplicated genes in teleosts following WGDs. As previously described for zebrafish, we identified two copies (fabp7a and fabp7b) of the brain-type fabp gene in several fish including rainbow smelt, but there was only a single transcript in northern pike, the closest relative of the salmonids, and two rather than the expected four fabp7 genes in Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout and grayling. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that a loss of the fabp7a gene occurred in the common ancestor of the northern pike and salmonids after it had diverged from the rainbow smelt, and that the 4R WGD then gave rise to the fabp7bI and fabp7bII observed in salmonids. This is supported by genetic mapping that placed the Atlantic salmon duplicated fabp7b genes on homeologous chromosomes. There was no evidence of neo-functionalization in the salmonid fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes based on dN/dS ratios and an examination of amino acid substitutions. Atlantic salmon fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes are both expressed broadly like fabp7b expression in northern pike. However, only Atlantic salmon fabp7bII, like its counterpart in northern pike and zebrafish, was expressed in the liver. A comparison of ~ 2000 bp upstream of Atlantic salmon fabp7b gene duplicates revealed an insertion of 62 bp in fabp7bI relative to fabp7bII. The presence of predicted transcription factor binding sites in this insertion sequence may explain the differential expression of the fabp7b gene duplicates in Atlantic salmon liver.

These cases were followed clinically, radiologially and by isotope examinations, with a follow-up of 2 to 6 years (from 1979 to 1983). This procedure appears to be useful in major reconstructions of the dome of the skull when autografts cannot be used.

3534,"Pre-treatment of adult rats with high doses of erythropoietin induces caspase-9 but prevents light-induced retinal injury Erythropoietin (Epo) had been shown to have a neuroprotective effect independent from its erythropoietic properties. In this study, we tested whether Epo could protect the retina from damage induced by a long period of moderate light insult and how it protected. First, rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) by human recombinant Epo at 5000 or 30,000U/kg to assess Epo concentration in plasma and retina. Second, rats were untreated or injected i.p. with Epo at 30,000U/kg, 1 or 4h before being placed in constant light (24h; 2200lux). Electroretinograms (ERG) were recorded before treatment, 1day and 15days (D15) after light exposure. After the last ERG, eyes were taken for histology. In parallel, we tested Epo protection against oxidative stressors on isolated retinas and its effect on caspase-9 activity. Epo injected at 30,000U/kg body weight, 4h before exposure to the damaging light, protected retinal function and structure against light damage and induced an increase in caspase-9 activity and expression. Epo had no direct or indirect protective effect against free radicals-induced death on isolated retinas. Epo protected the retina from a long period of moderate light exposure through a mechanism independent from a free radical scavenging property or an antioxidant facilitating activity. The activation of caspase-9, 4h after Epo injection, corresponding to the start of light exposure, suggests that caspase-9 plays a role in neuroprotection.",Excluded

We reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent LINAC radiosurgery for brain metastasis at our institution during 2010-2012, and who had not previously undergone either surgery or whole brain radiotherapy. Data were analyzed for 55 brain metastases from 46 patients (24 males), mean age 59.9 years. During the 2 months following LINAC radiosurgery, the mean steroid dose decreased from 4.8 to 2.6 mg/day, the mean metastasis volume decreased from 3.79+/-4.12 cc to 2.8+/-4.48 cc (p=0.001), and the mean edema volume decreased from 16.91+/-30.15 cc to 12.85+/-24.47 cc (p=0.23). The 17 patients with reductions of more than 50% in brain edema volume had single metastases. Edema volume in the nine patients with two brain metastases remained stable in five patients (volume change <10%, 0-2 cc) and increased in four patients (by >10%, 2-14 cc). In a subanalysis of eight metastases with baseline edema volume greater than 40 cc, edema volume decreased from 77.27+/-37.21 cc to 24.84+/-35.6 cc (p=0.034). Reductions in brain edema were greater in metastases for which non-small-cell lung carcinoma and breast cancers were the primary diseases. Overall, symptoms improved in most patients. No patients who were without symptoms or who had no signs of increased intracranial pressure at baseline developed signs of intracranial pressure following LINAC radiosurgery.

2913,"Bnct combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas INTRODUCTION: Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control. We have often treated RMGs using tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN, we herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT, and evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. METHOD(S): Two cohorts were included. The first and second cohorts were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, and between August 2017 and December 2017, respectively. They were followed by successive BV treatments. The first cohort was composed of 7 patients with RMGs (4 grade 4 and 3 grade 3 cases). The second cohort was composed of 6 patients with RMGs (5 grade 4 and 1 grade 3 cases). They were followed-up to April 2018. RESULT(S): Median OS and PFS after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively in the 1st cohort. Those in the second cohort were not reached. The OS data was compared with RPA classification for RMG as advocated by Carson et al. in a 2007 article in JCO. In both cohorts no symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred if BV could be continued. CTCAE grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments. Totally 11cases' OS in both cohorts were compared using JCO's RPA classification. Nine out of 11 cases showed longer OS in comparison with corresponding JCO's RPA classes. CONCLUSION(S): BNCT followed by BV treatments well-prevented or well-controlled BRN with prolonged OS and acceptable incidence of adverse events in our patients with RMG.",Excluded

The men had received primary or salvage external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT in combination with brachytherapy (BT). Prescribed doses were commonly 70 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions for primary and salvage EBRT and 50 Gy plus 2x10.0 Gy for EBRT+BT. Prostatic urethral doses were assessed from treatment records. We also recruited 350 non-pelvic-irradiated, population-based controls matched for age and residency to provide symptom background rates.RESULTS: Of the treated men, 16% (137 of 863) reported urethral pain, compared with 11% (27 of 242) of the controls. The median time to follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1.1-14.3 years). Prostatic urethral doses were similar to prescription doses for EBRT and 100% to 115% for BT. Fractionation-corrected dose and time to follow-up affected the occurrence of the symptom. For a follow-up>=3 years, 19% of men (52 of 268) within the 70-Gy EBRT+BT group reported pain, compared with 10% of men (23 of 222) treated with 70 Gy primary EBRT (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0). Of the men treated with salvage EBRT, 10% (20 of 197) reported urethral pain.CONCLUSIONS: Survivors treated with EBRT+BT had a higher risk for urethral pain compared with those treated with EBRT. The symptom prevalence decreased with longer time to follow-up. We found a relationship between fractionation-corrected urethral dose and pain. Among long-term prostate cancer survivors, the occurrence of pain was not increased above the background rate for prostatic urethral doses up to 70 Gy3.",Included

This study had 16 Se-supplemented (0.5 micrograms Se/d) and 16 placebo adult male Wistar rats. One half of the animals (eight Se-supplemented and eight placebos) were irradiated with a single dose of 4.2 Gy from a Co-60 source and sacrificed 7 d after irradiation along with nonirradiated animals and analyzed for Se content determination. The data obtained showed that selenous yeast supplementation increased Se levels in rat tissues (highest increases in hypothalamus, 161%; hind brain, 126%; spleen, 110%; and adrenal gland, 105%). Ionizing radiation induced significant changes in Se content and distribution (decrease in liver, blood, hair, femoral muscle, spleen, and hypothalamus; increase in kidney, testes, adrenal glands, and brain of placebo group). Supplementation with selenous yeast reduces changes in Se content and distribution after irradiation.

The present study compared the effects of gamma irradiation on the expression of interneuron markers within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region with expression in control matched rats. This area was chosen for study because of its well-characterized circuitry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 60 Gy of whole brain gamma radiation and after 24 or 48 hours, the brains were removed, fixed and sectioned to quantitate expression of parvalbumin (PV), calbindin-D28K (CB), reelin, neuropeptide-Y (NPY), and somatostatin. All of these markers increased in expression over the first 48 hours, except NPY, which decreased. This provides novel information on changes in gene expression in the hippocampal interneurons following radiation. Staining for Beclin 1, a marker of autophagy, increased most strongly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased intracellular calcium follows irradiation, leading to an increased expression of calcium binding proteins. Increased autophagy occurs in the neurogenic zone of the dentate hilus, consistent with reduced effective neurogenesis after irradiation.",Included

The latent period was found to be dependent on dose in the ED0 to ED100 dose range, independent of dose in the range ED100 to 1.5 times the ED100 dose and dependent on dose for doses more than 1.5 times the ED100 dose. Histologically, some vascular injury and demyelinization were observed in the irradiated cord segment of all paretic animals. In the first dose-dependent region there was a bimodal distribution of latent periods, suggesting two mechanisms for paralysis in this dose region. A hypothesis based on glial and vascular injury is presented which explains the triphasic dose-response relationship for the latent period. The 95% confidence limits for the dose location of both of the dose-dependent regions were less than 10% of the administered dose. Therefore, if used correctly, the latent period as an end point should be able to be used to detect dose-modifying parameters (i.e. RBE and OER) that are greater than 20%.",Included
1584,"[""Glare vision"". I. Physiological principles of vision change with increased test field luminance] Clinical tests of visual acuity are an important measure of visual function. However visual acuity is usually determined only in narrow range of luminance levels between 160 and 320 cd/m2; therefore losses of visual acuity in other ranges of light intensity can not be detected. In a distance of 80 cm from the patients eyes, Landolt rings of varying sizes were presented on a small test field whose light intensity can be varied between 0.1 and 30,000 cd/m2. Thereby an acuity-luminance-function can be obtained. We studied such functions under different conditions of exposure time both with constant and with increasing luminance of the test field. We found that persons with normal vision can increase their visual acuity with increasing test field luminance up to a range of 5000 cd/m2. The maximum values of visual acuity under optimal lightening conditions lie (varying with age) between 2.2 and 0.9. Under pathological conditions visual acuity falls at high luminances accompanied by sensations of glare. Tests of glare sensitivity as a function of exposure time showed 4 sec to be a critical time of exposure since after 4 sec normal persons just reach their maximum visual acuity at high luminances. The underlying physiological mechanisms lead us to suppose that patients with neuronal light adaptation disturbances display a greater visual loss as a result of decreased time of exposure than those with disturbances in the ocular media. Visual acuity as well as the capacity to increase the patients visual acuity under optimal conditions of lighting were both found to be strongly age-dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of irradiation and the addition of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and thymoquinone (TQ) on the oxidant/antioxidant system in the liver tissue of irradiated rats. Methods: A total of 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of thymoquinone and caffeic acid phenethyl ester administered by intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Results: While liver tissue total oxidant status, lipid hydroperoxide level, and oxidative stress index were significantly increased in the irradiated (IR) group, compared with other groups, total antioxidant status, sulfhydryl levels, and paraoxonase (PON) activity were significantly decreased. Ceruloplasmin activity in IR plus TQ and IR groups was higher than the control group. Arylesterase and PON activities in IR plus TQ- and IR plus CAPE-supplemented groups were lower than those of control groups.

After comparing the habituation indices, the multi-scale entropies and the time dependent intrinsic correlations of their SSVEP signals, we reached a tentative conclusion that sharp red and white light pulses flickering barely above their CFF frequencies can replace commonly used 13Hz stimuli to effectively cause SSVEP habituation among normal subjects. Empirical results showed that consecutive short bursts of light can produce more consistent responses than a single prolonged stimulation. Since these high frequency stimuli do not run the risk of triggering migraine or seizure attacks, further tests of these stimuli on migraine patients are warranted in order to verify their effectiveness.",Excluded

The equivalent dose was obtained by conversion of the dose-area product using published conversion tables.RESULTS: The maximum entrance skin dose varied from 129 to 1335 mGy. The mean effective dose was 1.67 mSv with a range of 0.44 to 3.44 mSv. No deterministic effect has been encountered. Stochastic risk linked to the highest effective dose value was approximately one death by fatal cancer for every 6000 procedures, according to the new International Commission on Radiological Protection coefficient.CONCLUSIONS: Because no deterministic effect has been detected, and stochastic risks were very low, radiation hazard to the patient is a minor consideration in deciding whether to undertake a neurointerventional procedure.",Excluded

Radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis is associated with permanent neurological deficits and occasionally progresses to death.OBJECTIVE: We present our experience with surgery on radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis (RTLN) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with special consideration of clinical presentation, surgical technique, and outcomes.METHOD: This retrospective study includes 12 patients with RTLN treated by the senior author between January 2010 and December 2014. Patients initially sought medical treatment due to headache; other symptoms were hearing loss, visual deterioration, seizure, hemiparesis, vertigo, memory loss and agnosia. A temporal approach through a linear incision was performed for all cases. RTLN was found in one side in 7 patients, and bilaterally in 5. 4 patients underwent resection of necrotic tissue bilaterally and 8 patients on one side.RESULTS: No death occurred in this series of cases. There were no post-operative complications, except 1 patient who developed aseptic meningitis. All 12 patients were free from headache. No seizure occurred in patients with preoperative epilepsy. Other symptoms such as hemiparesis and vertigo improved in all patients. Memory loss, agnosia and hearing loss did not change post-operatively in all cases. The follow-up MR images demonstrated no recurrence of necrotic lesions in all 12 patients.CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical intervention through a temporal approach with linear incision is warranted in patients with radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis with significant symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure, minimum space occupying effect on imaging, or neurological deterioration despite conservative management.",Excluded
3309,"A review of the necessary planning target volume margins for patients receiving radiation to the brain, with the current immobilization devices in use at the hopital regional de sudbury regional hospital regional cancer program The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the current margins of the planning target volumes in brain patients being treated at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program. The gross tumour volume (GTV) is defined in the International Commission for Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU) report 83 (2010) as the gross demonstrable extent and location of the tumour. The clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as the volume of a tissue that contains the GTV and any microscopic tumour spread. The planning target volume (PTV) is defined by the ICRU 83 report (2010) as the margin accounting for both the internal and external uncertainties. With the use of image-guided radiation therapy such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), imaging and positioning has become much more accurate. A CBCT uses a 3D reconstructed volume of the patient's current position before treatment to verify and correct the setup. This is done by comparing it to the planning patient position as seen with the planning CT image and making any adjustments while the patient is on the bed (Pouliot, Bani-Hashemi, Chen, Svatos, Ghelmansarai, Mitschke, 2005). Daily imaging before treatment has allowed for positioning of the patient accurately to match the image taken for planning purposes. This allows the patient to be set up within millimetres of the position they were in for planning. Currently at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program, daily imaging for patients receiving radiation to the brain is not standard practice, however, some patients are imaged daily by request from the physician. By using the shift data from patients who have received daily imaging, the setup uncertainty for every fraction can be determined and used to determine an appropriate PTV margin for the majority of patients, who are not imaged daily. If the PTV can be reduced for brain patients being treated, less of the normal brain tissue would be irradiated and could have the potential to reduce acute and late neurotoxicity of treatment (McDonald et al., 2011). A retrospective review of patients who have previously received radiation to the brain with daily CBCT imaging will be done to examine the shifts done before treatment to match the CBCT to the planning CT image. The patient population will include patients who received brain radiation and a daily CBCT before treatment since July 2010. The images taken daily before treatment will be retrospectively studied using the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program's electronic charting system (Mosaic). The shift data examined of patients who received daily imaging can be applied to a calculation proposed by van Herk (2004) to determine the PTV margin accounting for setup error. The shift data describes the measurements by which the patient was shifted after daily imaging to match the original planning image. This equation uses the shift data to determine the PTV margin for those patients who do not receive daily imaging. All patient data will be anonymous and will be kept on a locked password protected computer.",Excluded
3288,"Point process analysis of noise in early invertebrate vision Noise is a prevalent and sometimes even dominant aspect of many biological processes. While many natural systems have adapted to attenuate or even usefully integrate noise, the variability it introduces often still delimits the achievable precision across biological functions. This is particularly so for visual phototransduction, the process responsible for converting photons of light into usable electrical signals (quantum bumps). Here, randomness of both the photon inputs (regarded as extrinsic noise) and the conversion process (intrinsic noise) are seen as two distinct, independent and significant limitations on visual reliability. Past research has attempted to quantify the relative effects of these noise sources by using approximate methods that do not fully account for the discrete, point process and time ordered nature of the problem. As a result the conclusions drawn from these different approaches have led to inconsistent expositions of phototransduction noise performance. This paper provides a fresh and complete analysis of the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in invertebrate phototransduction using minimum mean squared error reconstruction techniques based on Bayesian point process (Snyder) filters. An integrate-fire based algorithm is developed to reliably estimate photon times from quantum bumps and Snyder filters are then used to causally estimate random light intensities both at the front and back end of the phototransduction cascade. Comparison of these estimates reveals that the dominant noise source transitions from extrinsic to intrinsic as light intensity increases. By extending the filtering techniques to account for delays, it is further found that among the intrinsic noise components, which include bump latency (mean delay and jitter) and shape (amplitude and width) variance, it is the mean delay that is critical to noise performance. As the timeliness of visual information is important for real-time action, this delay could potentially limit the speed at which invertebrates can respond to stimuli. Consequently, if one wants to increase visual fidelity, reducing the photoconversion lag is much more important than improving the regularity of the electrical signal.",Excluded

However, previous reports are limited by small patient population. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological data of 53 patients with CMs of basal ganglia and thalamus who underwent GKRS at West China Hospital between May 2009 and July 2018. All patients suffered at least once bleeding before GKRS. The mean volume of these lesions was 1.77 cm, and the mean marginal dose was 13.2 Gy. After treatment, patients were followed to determine the change in symptom and hemorrhage event. Result(s): The mean follow-up period was 52.1 months (6.2-104.3 months). The calculated annual hemorrhage rate (AHR) was 48.5% prior to GKRS and 3.0% after treatment (p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 2-, 3-, and 5-year hemorrhage-free survival were 88, 80.9, and 80.9%, respectively. Preexisting symptoms were resolved in 11 patients, improved in 14, and stable in 5. Only 2 patients (3.8%) developed new neurological deficit. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that AHR after GKRS was comparable to the recorded AHR of natural history (3.1-4.1%) in previous studies. GKRS is a safe and effective treatment modality for CMs of basal ganglia and thalamus. Considering the relative insufficient understanding of natural history of CMs, future study warrants longer follow-up. Â© 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.",Excluded

Measuring local cerebral blood flow and histopathological studies] BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate late effects following stereotactic single fraction and small volume irradiation on cerebral blood flow and histologic alterations in the rat brain parenchyma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 Copenhagen rats, separated into eleven groups of six animals each received single doses of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 Gy using a 15 MV linear accelerator. Six rats served as controls. Two cylindrical collimators of 2 mm and 3 mm aperture were used. The diameters of the spherical 80% isodose were 3.7 and 4.7 mm, respectively (Table 1). Irradiation was applied to a predefined area in the right frontal lobe. 19 months after irradiation local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method in one animal of each dose group between 20 and 50 Gy. 9 and 19 months after irradiation, half of the animals of each group were sacrificed for brain histology. All animals irradiated with 100 Gy were sacrificed 7 months after irradiation.RESULTS: An increase of local cerebral blood flow was measured in brain structures within the 80% isodose in animals irradiated with 50 Gy (Figure 3) compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Measurements close to necrotic areas showed a strong decrease of local cerebral blood flow (Figure 1). A volume increase of the irradiated hemisphere was seen after 19 months (Figure 2). The histologic examination after 19 months showed necrotic areas in the 30-50 Gy groups (Figure 4b) but not in the 20 Gy groups (Figure 4c). The animals who received 100 Gy demonstrated brain necrosis within 9 months after irradiation (Figure 4a). At both points in time the groups irradiated with the 3-mm collimator showed more pronounced histomorphologic and functional changes compared to the groups irradiated with the 2-mm collimator.CONCLUSION: Alterations of the local cerebral blood flow were measured as a late effect after single dose irradiation.

We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation to induce surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo, to assess their suitability as vascular targets in irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",Included

Exposure to these particles can affect the ability of rats to perform a variety of tasks, indicating that there is the possibility that the performance capabilities of astronauts may be affected. Previous research has shown that diets containing blueberry or strawberry extract can ameliorate the deficits produced by irradiation using a ground-based analog for exposure to cosmic rays. Rats were placed on diets containing 2% blueberry or strawberry extract for 2 months prior to exposure to 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe particles. There were no effects on performance of any group of animals when tested on an ascending fixed-ratio operant task 6 months following exposure. When tested 12 months after exposure, the performance of the radiated animals given blueberry extract did not differ from the radiated animals fed the control diet. Both groups performed significantly poorer than the non-irradiated controls. There were no differences between the non-irradiated animals fed control diet and the radiated animals fed the strawberry diet and their performance was significantly better than of the radiated rats fed the blueberry or control diets. The results indicate that diets containing strawberry extract may provide a significant level of radiation protection on exploratory class missions.",Included
3375,"Reduced-dose radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas OBJECTIVE: To evaluate tumor control and complications associated with low-dose radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas. METHOD(S): Between December 1993 and January 2000, 47 patients with vestibular schwannomas were treated at our center with gamma knife radiosurgery. The marginal tumor doses ranged from 7.5 to 14.0 Gy (median, 12.0 Gy) for patients treated after microsurgery and from 10.0 to 15.0 Gy (median, 12.0 Gy) for patients in whom radiosurgery was the primary treatment. The median maximum tumor diameter was 18 mm (range, 3-50 mm). Evaluation included audiometry, neurological examination, and serial imaging tests. A survey was conducted at the time of analysis. RESULT(S): Follow-up data were available for 45 patients and ranged from 1 to 7 years (median, 3.6 yr). In 43 patients (96%), tumor control (no radiographic progression or surgical resection) was observed. All 33 previously untreated patients had tumor control. Transient facial weakness, experienced in two patients (4%), had resolved completely within 6 months. No patient developed trigeminal neuropathy. Hearing was diminished from baseline in 12% of patients with useful hearing (Gardner-Robertson Class III). However, all patients with pretreatment hearing Gardner-Robertson Class I or II maintained testable hearing (Class I to III) at the most recent examination. CONCLUSION(S): Low-dose radiosurgery in this series provided comparable local control and decreased incidences of complications in relation to other reports. Additional follow-up will allow more definitive conclusions to be reached regarding the ultimate rates of tumor control and hearing preservation. Nevertheless, the current dose used for vestibular schwannomas at the University of Maryland Medical Center is 12.0 Gy to the tumor periphery.",Excluded

The Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO), equipped with a synchrotron and capable of using both protons and ions, initiated its clinical activity in September 2011. The first treatment of a skull base tumor with protons is reported here. The case of a 26-year-old man with an intracranial low-grade chondrosarcoma of the right petroclival junction is discussed with emphasis on technical and clinical details. Two previous surgical interventions had achieved partial removal of the tumor and the patient was treated with protons for residual disease. The prescribed dose was 70 GyE in 35 fractions of 2 GyE. Treatment was completed with minimal acute toxicity consisting of grade 1 alopecia and nausea. Nine months after treatment the disease is locally controlled. Use of high-energy protons at CNAO is a safe and effective means of treating a tumor located near critical normal structures.

There are few proven causes of brain tumors: high-dose ionizing radiation, inherited genetic syndromes and AIDs-related brain lymphomas. Promising avenues of research include the role of immune function, genetic components in families, metabolic and DNA-repair pathways and neurocarcinogen exposures. [References: 104]",Excluded
1323,"Aberrant regulation of interleukin-2 but not of interferon-gamma gene expression in Down syndrome (trisomy 21) The regulated expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) genes was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 29 noninstitutionalized Down syndrome individuals and compared to that of 32 normal donors. Culture conditions were chosen that measure the transient, phytohemagglutinin-induced expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA, as well as the intactness of post-transcriptional and suppressor T cell-dependent mechanisms that control this expression. The latter was achieved by analyzing, respectively, the superinduction of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA occurring upon culture with cycloheximide or after low-dose gamma-irradiation. A convenient, sensitive, and quantitative assay for specific mRNA was devised, suitable for measuring mRNA levels expressed in cells from 1 ml of peripheral blood. Analysis of individuals with Down syndrome revealed a pronounced decrease in inducibility of the IL-2 gene. By contrast, induction of IFN-gamma mRNA was as vigorous as that observed for normal donors. In cells from trisomic subjects, superinduction of IFN-gamma mRNA by cycloheximide was at least as extensive as for normal donors, while in the case of IL-2 mRNA, it was weaker. These abnormal patterns of IL-2 gene expression were seen irrespective of age. Our findings demonstrate a selective impairment of IL-2 gene expression in Down syndrome, rather than a general deficiency in helper T cells.",Excluded
3426,"Physics of surgery with lasers The characteristics of the principal lasers used in surgery are summarized in Table 1. Their diverse effects on biologic tissues permit the following generalizations: The CO2 laser is best suited for precise, visually controllable tissue removal by vaporization with minimal marginal damage. Hemostasis is excellent for bleeding from capillary vessels, but difficult for larger ones. The Nd:YAG laser is best suited for the coagulation of larger tissue volumes of the order of 10 mm3 or more. Tissue heating inherently extends for several millimeters, leading to excellent hemostasis. Radiation from this laser is well transmitted through flexible optical fibers and clear fluids. The argon ion laser emits radiation in the visible range and is ideally suited for treating the retina and other tissues in the eye without damage to its transparent structures. Radiation of this laser is strongly absorbed by pigmented tissues, scattered and reflected by others, and transmitted by fluids. Its radiation can be focused to very small spot sizes, leading to high precision and high-power densities. It has hemostatic properties intermediate between those of the CO2 and of the Nd:YAG laser radiations. It is well transmitted through optical fibers and clear fluids. It is used extensively in ophthalmology and dermatology. Selected applications to neurosurgery and otology are being investigated. These lasers have become indispensable adjuncts to the surgical armamentarium of several specialties. The very success of these lasers is leading to a critical examination of their shortcomings and to a search for improved systems. Examples are (1) the ongoing search for optical fibers to transmit the radiation of the CO2 laser; (2) the development of systems for the sequential delivery to tissues of several wavelengths from a single unit (Fig. 14); and (3) investigations of tissue effects of laser beams in the ultraviolet and in the infrared at wavelengths intermediate between those of the Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers. The use of lasers has already contributed to improved medical care in many surgical disciplines. Additional areas of application can be confidently anticipated.",Excluded
822,"The possibility of surgery for small cell lung cancer (state of art). [Hungarian] The author provides information about epidemiology as well as surgical practice for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in Hungary. It is emphasized that, based on the author's experience and on international consensus, TNM system is the basis of accurate oncological treatment. The oncological management of SCLC is summarized, which is based on surgery. SCLC, especially cases undergoing surgery, are often detected as a peripheral nodule which should be examined preoperatively by special algorithm. Despite the published favorable results, surgical treatment alone is not accepted nowadays as a correct oncological point of view. The aim of adjuvant therapy is to improve survival and to decrease local recurrence. The 5-year survival of SCLC according to stages is between 4 and 60%. After the late 80's, the complex multimodality oncotherapy has started, with neoadjuvant treatment. SCLC is chemosensitive, even at N2 stage after down-staging surgery might be available. The late results show 20-46% cumulative 5-year survival rate. However, in the case of N2 disease, only 15-30% 5-year survival is achieved. This is a critical question for surgery of SCLC, because the dominant opinion is that for N2 disease and especially residual N2 surgery does not prolong survival. SCLC often occurs in combination with NSCLC. Therefore, salvage operation is a possible choice to remove the residual chemo/radiation resistant SCLC and NSCLC components. In conclusion, surgery has an advantage for SCLC therapy especially in patients with stage I-II disease. Value of surgery for stage III/a disease is under discussion and it is not recommended in Hungarian practice. To use a complex neoadjuvant protocol is advised which provides from 20 up to 40% five-year survival rate.",Excluded
696,"Contrasting the effects of proton irradiation on dendritic complexity of subiculum neurons in wild type and MCAT mice Growing evidence suggests that radiation-induced oxidative stress directly affects a wide range of biological changes with an overall negative impact on CNS function. In the past we have demonstrated that transgenic mice over-expressing human catalase targeted to the mitochondria (MCAT) exhibit a range of neuroprotective phenotypes following irradiation that include improved neurogenesis, dendritic complexity, and cognition. To determine the extent of the neuroprotective phenotype afforded by MCAT expression in different hippocampal regions, we analyzed subiculum neurons for changes in neuronal structure and synaptic integrity after exposure to low dose (0.5 Gy) 150 MeV proton irradiation. One month following irradiation of WT and MCAT mice, a range of morphometric parameters were quantified along Golgi-Cox impregnated neurons. Compared with WT mice, subiculum neurons from MCAT mice exhibited increased trends (albeit not statistically significant) toward increased dendritic complexity in both control and irradiated cohorts. However, Sholl analysis of MCAT mice revealed significantly increased arborization of the distal dendritic tree, indicating a protective effect on secondary and tertiary branching. Interestingly, radiation-induced increases in postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95) puncta were not as pronounced in MCAT compared with WT mice, and were significantly lower after the 0.5 Gy dose. As past data has linked radiation exposure to reduced dendritic complexity, elevated PSD-95 and impaired cognition, reductions in mitochondrial oxidative stress have proven useful in ameliorating many of these radiation-induced sequelae. Data presented here shows similar trends, and again points to the potential benefits of reducing oxidative stress in the brain to attenuate radiation injury. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 57:364-371, 2016.

2376,"Treatment of cerebral radionecrosis by hyperbaric oxygen therapy Clinically observed adverse radiation effects (ARE) are rather uncommon, but modern imaging reveals that they are more common after radiosurgery than previously believed. Little is known about the pathogenesis, and current treatment is mostly empirical. The benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) on radiation-induced bone and soft tissue necrosis is known in lesions in the maxillofacial area, the mouth and in the head and neck. HBO raises the tissue pO2 and initiates a cellular and vascular repair mechanism. This forms the basis for the hypothesis that it might also help alleviate the results of cerebral radionecrosis. This study is a preliminary attempt to test this hypothesis. Two patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were chosen for the study. They had been treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and had developed imaging signs consistent with ARE. They were treated by breathing 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (250 kPa) in sessions of 60 minutes per day. This treatment was repeated 40 times in cycles of ten sessions. Both responded well to HBO, one lesion disappeared and the other was reduced significantly in size. No adjuvant steroids were given. These results give evidence that HBO has a potential value in treating ARE but further experience will be needed to confirm its definite benefit.",Excluded

Thirty-six patients received Gd-DTPA enhanced study during the course of MR evaluation and six of the patients showed enhancing radiation necrosis. Histopathological confirmations were obtained in three patients. Gd-DTPA enhancing radiation lesions were multiple and patchy in three patients, multiple and patchy with cyst formation in two and ring shaped in one. In terms of their distribution, enhancing lesions in four patients were seen only in the white matter within the irradiated field and these patients had undergone radiotherapy within five years. The interval after radiotherapy was more than eight years in two patients and their enhanced lesions were observed in both the white and gray matter. Histopathological findings of Gd-DTPA enhancing radiation necrosis were gliosis and coalescing vacuoles of the neural tissue. None of these enhanced radiation lesions showed significant mass effects. Patterns of the enhancement were not specific. It was considered to be difficult to differentiate tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis with conventional Gd-DTPA enhanced MR examinations. In one patient, delayed MR images after Gd-DTPA administration showed increases in the size and number of radiation enhanced lesions. Dynamic and delayed MR study might add more information to conventional imaging after Gd-DTPA. Further studies are necessary to differentiate radiation lesions from tumor recurrences.",Excluded

Emerging evidence in the healthcare literature shows the potential role of DP theory-driven approaches to skill acquisition in educational settings. While it has been extensively reviewed in other health professions, there is a lack of empirical evidence of its value within the medical radiation science (MRS) professions. Professional capabilities and accreditation standards highlight the minimum level of competence for graduates to safely practise the profession. Many of these defined competencies and standards involve observable complex psychomotor and cognitive skills.

The authors draw on specific examples from the sonography and radiation therapy educational contexts and provide strategies for isolating and improving various domain-specific skills. While the concept of DP may appear relevant to the development of different MRS skills, a lack of development of evidence-based DP frameworks for MRS is evident. It will require extensive research and collaboration, with the primary aim of accelerating student and practitioner confidence, ultimately improving the quality of patient care and safety with the medical radiation practices.",Excluded

We have tested these models experimentally for the first time using a bacterial analogue (Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum) which produces intracellular biogenic magnetite similar to that present in the human brain. Experimental evaluation revealed that exposure to mobile phone emissions resulted in a consistent and significantly higher proportion of cell death in exposed cultures versus sham exposure (p = 0.037).

Methods and procedure: A patient with locally advanced, distal rectal cancer and tumor abutting the prostate was selected for transanal TME using TAMIS, with intra-operative CT-guided navigation to ensure an R0 resection. Result(s): The use of stereotactic TAMIS-TME was successfully performed with an accuracy of +/-4 mm.

Method(s): We analyzed adults who presented with AML and CNS relapses from 2000 until 2014. CNS leukemia was diagnosed by the presence of blasts in a cytocentrifuge preparation of CSF. Pts with blasts in the CSF together with high numbers of red blood cells (> 5) were not considered to have CNS disease if the blasts were high in the PB. Result(s): Of the 1312 pts with AML treated at our institution, 71 (5%) had CNS disease. Median age was 57 years. CNS involvement was detected after a median of 8 months from the initial diagnosis. 4 pts (6%) had isolated CNS relapse that was followed by systemic relapse after a median of 2 weeks. CNS involvement was detected in the setting of refractory AML in 31 pts (44%). 64 pts (90%) received previous high-dose cytarabine. 54 pts (76%) had neurologic symptoms at time of CNS relapse. CNS imaging was performed in 67 pts (94%): 41 (61%) had abnormal findings by MRI suggestive of CNS disease. 4 pts had zero cells with blasts detected on cytocentrifuge preparation only. None of the 4 pts had circulating blasts and all had abnormal findings on brain MRI suggestive of CNS relapse. 18 pts (25%) were FLT3-ITD mutated. CNS involvement was more commonly observed in young pts with increased WBC, BM blasts, and LDH, with M4/M5 phenotype, and FLT3/ITD mutated (12% versus 5%, p=0.003). Treatment for CNS disease consisted of IT chemotherapy in all pts, whole brain radiation therapy in 14, and spinal radiation in 8.

Despite the efficacy of treatment, the use of this therapy has met some limitations associated with possible damage to normal brain tissues located beyond the tumor site. In this context, the exploration of the harmful effects of protons on the normal brain tissues is of particular interest. We have investigated changes in the total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and identified mtDNA mutant copies in three brain regions (the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum) of rats after irradiation their whole-head with 150 MeV protons at doses of 3 and 5 Gy. The study was performed in 2-months old male Spraque Dawley rats (n = 5 each group). The mtDNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR. The level of mtDNA heteroplasmy was estimated using Surveyor nuclease technology. Our results show that after head exposure to protons, levels of mtDNA copy number in three rat brain regions increase significantly as the levels of mtDNA mutant copies increase. The most significant elevation is observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, an increase in mtDNA mutant copies may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by increased oxidative stress in different brain regions and promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the induction of carcinogenesis.",Included

In the central nervous system (CNS), loss of critical cellular components may lead to performance decrements that could ultimately compromise mission goals and long-term quality of life. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments occur after exposure to ionizing radiation, and while the pathogenesis of this effect is not yet clear, it may involve the production of newly born neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We irradiated mice with 0.5-4 Gy of (56)Fe ions and 2 months later quantified neurogenesis and numbers of activated microglia as a measure of neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that there were few changes after 0.5 Gy, but that there was a dose-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and a dose-related increase in numbers of newly born activated microglia from 0.5-4.0 Gy. While those findings were similar to what was reported after X irradiation, there were also some differences, particularly in the response of newly born glia. Overall, this study showed that hippocampal neurogenesis was sensitive to relatively low doses of (56)Fe particles, and that those effects were associated with neuroinflammation.

The hormonal status and age of an animal at the time of exposure affect the severity of light-induced retinal damage. The adrenal axis and pituitary hormones (prolactin) have been demonstrated previously to affect the degree of cell death in the retina. Because circadian rhythms for adrenal and pituitary secretion have been demonstrated in the rat, a series of experiments was undertaken to determine if a diurnal pattern of retinal susceptibility to light damage exists which might be related to endogenous endocrine rhythms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 4 hr of high intensity fluorescent light for 8 consecutive days during different phases of the 14:10 hr light: dark animal room light cycle. Morphometric analysis performed at the light microscopic level 2 weeks after exposure demonstrated a differential susceptibility to light-induced cell death depending upon the period during the light-dark cycle when animals received their daily light exposure. Neuronal cell death was confined to the outer nuclear layer as previously described. The retinas of animals exposed during the middle of the dark period or during the first 5 hr of the light period were significantly more damaged than the retinas of animals exposed during the last 9 hr of the light period. Control groups for the relative amounts of dark-adaptation between groups suggested that the diurnal susceptibility to light damage was not solely dependent upon the degree of dark adaptation.

In response to IR, autophosphorylation on serine 1981 causes dissociation of ATM dimers and initiates cellular ATM kinase activity. Here, we show that the kinetics and magnitude of ATM Ser1981 phosphorylation after exposure of human fibroblasts to low doses (2 Gy) of IR are altered in cells deficient in Nbs1, a substrate of ATM and a component of the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex involved in processing/repair of DSBs and ATM-dependent cell cycle checkpoints. Timely phosphorylation of both ATM Ser1981 and the ATM substrate Smc1 after IR were rescued via retrovirally mediated reconstitution of Nbs1-deficient cells by wild-type Nbs1 or mutants of Nbs1 defective in the FHA domain or nonphosphorylatable by ATM, but not by Nbs1 lacking the Mre11-interaction domain. Our data indicate that apart from its role downstream of ATM in the DNA damage checkpoint network, the MRN complex serves also as a modulator/amplifier of ATM activity. Although not absolutely required for ATM activation, the MRN nuclease complex may help reach the threshold activity of ATM necessary for optimal genome maintenance and prevention of cancer.",Excluded
657,"Upregulation of Connexin-43 is Critical for Irradiation-induced Neuroinflammation BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is widely used for the treatment of pituitary adenomas. Unfortunately, it might raise the risk of ischemic stroke, with neuroinflammation being a major pathological process. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system and have been reported for playing important roles in ischemic stroke.OBJECTIVE: Here we studied how gamma-radiation would introduce astrocytes into a detrimental state for neuroinflammation and provide new theory evidence and target for the clinical management of inflammation- related neural damage after radiation-induced ischemic stroke.METHOD: HA-1800 cells were treated with gamma-radiation and then the protein and mRNA levels of Connexin (Cx)-43 were evaluated by western and q-PCR. The culture supernatant was collected and the concentrations of the inflammatory factors were determined by ELISA. MiRNA complementary to Cx-43 was designed through the online tools.RESULTS: Cx-43 is upregulated in the treatment of gamma-radiation in astrocytes and gamma-radiation introduced the detrimental function of astrocytes: cell viability was reduced while the apoptotic cells were increased. Inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-6, interleukin 1-beta were dramatically up-regulated by the irradiation. MiR-374a rescued irradiation induced Cx-43 up-regulation of astrocytes and eliminated detrimental function triggered by gamma-radiation.CONCLUSION: Cx-43 expression level may play an important role in the inflammation-related neural damage after irradiation-induced ischemic stroke.",Included

Cochlear function was tested in a cohort of 22 patients before and 7-84 months after receiving external irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The pre-irradiation sensori-neural hearing threshold at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz was used as a baseline for the individual patient, and the observed sensori-neural hearing loss (SNHL) was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-irradiation values. The pre-irradiation hearing level or patient age was not correlated with the actual SNHL. In contrast, there was a significant correlation between the total radiation dose to the inner ear and the observed hearing impairment. SNHL was most pronounced in the high frequencies, with values up to 35 dB (4000 Hz) and 25 dB (2000 Hz) in some patients. The latent period for the complication appeared to be 12 months or more. The deleterious effect of irradiation on the hearing should be kept in mind both in treatment planning and in the follow-up after radiotherapy.",Excluded
537,"Neuronavigation role in the percutaneous treatment of thoracolumbar fractures Introduction: Application of the neuronavigation techniques to the widely used percutaneous pedicle screw techniques allows to combine the traditional AP and LL intraoperatory fluoroscopy images with three-dimensional reconstruction CT images. The surgeon have very important informations about the axial plane having a real time feedback to the exact spinal surgical anatomy. This makes more ""minimally invasive"" surgical procedure and reduces patients and operators exposure to ionizing radiation. We used this technique in the treatment of Magerl's A2-A3 thoracolumbar fracture. Material(s) and Method(s): From June 2010 thru September 2012, 25 patients (16 male and 9 female) underwent surgical treatment for thoracolumbar hinge (D12-L1) fracture with a completely neuronavigated percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique using a posterior approach. Inclusions criteria were: monolevel Magerl's A2- A3 thoracolumbar fractures, no posterior wall involvement and/or fragments occupying the spinal canal for more than 25 % according to Hashimoto, McCormack score <=6 with posterior longitudinal ligament's integrity, no neurological deficits. Although the percutaneous neuronavigated techniques are widely used in different centers, in these cases also the pedicle screws were neuronavigated, to make surgical procedure more accurate and precise. The positioning of percutaneous pedicle screw was performed using Stealth 7 Medtronic (Fridley, Minnesota, USA) neuronavigation system with a completely neuronavigated surgical instruments (CD Horizon Longitude) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). In 2 cases we used real-time 3-D images acquired with O-Arm system to have a further collimation of the neuronavigated data with the acquired images reducing intraoperative fluoroscopic controls. The follow-up provided Rx study in second post-operative day and in 1 and 6 months post-op. Result(s): The percutaneous neuronavigated technique have proved to be useful for the surgeon because in addition to the traditional fluoroscopic AP and LL images, uses three-dimensional reconstruction CT images, viewing also axial projections. In cases in which we used the O-Arm, were appreciated the usefulness of the 3-D images realtime. There were no cases of surgical instrumentation's failure. The patients have been mobilized in the first post-operative day with a more rapid resolution of painful symptoms and returned to perform their work activities more quickly. The Rx post-operative controls at 6 months have demonstrated the correct positioning of the pedicle screws and the correct fusion in 95 % of patients. Conclusion(s): The percutaneously entirely neuronavigated pedicle screws fixation is an effective and safe technique for the treatment of the hinge thoraco-lumbar fractures. The technique used in carefully selected patients reduces the time required for surgery, intraoperative blood loss, and ensures greater anatomical detail making more safely the placement of pedicle screws reducing the risks of ""screw misplacement"".",Excluded

1380,"Electron beam irradiation as protection against the environmental release of recombinant molecules for biomaterials applications In biomaterials applications there exists a need to protect against the environmental release of recombinant microorganisms and transmissible genetic material and to prevent the recovery of proprietary genetic information. Irradiation technologies have long been used to eliminate microorganisms associated with spoilage and contamination and recent studies have demonstrated that moderate doses of irradiation may be used to sterilize medically important proteins without causing adverse effects in their desirable biological properties. Recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing organophosphate hydrolase (OPH, E.C. 3.1.8.1), an important enzyme for the detection and decontamination of neurotoxic pesticides and chemical warfare agents, were subjected to electron beam irradiation to gauge its effect on enzymatic activity, cell viability and DNA recoverability. Bacterial samples were irradiated at 2, 20 and 200 kGy using a 10 MeV electron source. Irradiation levels of 2 to 20 kGy were sufficient to eliminate viable cells without affecting OPH enzymatic activity. Biologically active DNA was recovered via PCR from all samples through the 20 kGy irradiation level. While DNA was not recovered from samples at the 200 kGy exposure level, protein activity was reduced by 19 to 78%, depending on the method of cell preparation. These results demonstrate that irradiation can be effective in preventing the release of recombinant organisms intended for use in biomaterials applications without eliminating enzymatic activity and suggests that further research may indicate specific conditions whereby DNA recovery can be eliminated while retaining sufficient enzymatic activity for targeted biomaterials applications.",Excluded
3471,"Selective decrease in serotonin synthesis rate in rat brainstem raphe nuclei following chronic administration of low doses of amitriptyline: an effect compatible with an anti-migraine effect The effects of chronic, low-dose amitriptyline on serotonin (5-HT) synthesis rate were measured in rat brain using autoradiography and the trapping of alpha-[14C]-methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-[14C]-MTrp). Rats received amitriptyline (2 mg/kg per day) or saline via intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps for 21 days. Amitriptyline had no effect on any physiological parameters measured, or on free or total plasma tryptophan levels. However, amitriptyline exerted selective decreases of 15% and 17% (P < 0.001) in serotonin synthesis rates in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, respectively. There was no reduction in any of the projection areas studied, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus or striatum. The data suggest that chronic low doses of amitriptyline can lead to sustained 5-HT re-uptake inhibition selectively in the raphe nuclei, an effect compatible with tonic activation of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT synthesis. The failure of chronic amitriptyline treatment to affect 5-HT synthesis rate in the projection areas may ensure an adequate regulation of pain pathways implicated in migraine headache, an effect possibly related to amitriptyline anti-migraine efficacy.",Excluded

In the brain, ionizing radiation induces breakdown of the blood-brain barrier by effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. Damage from directly irradiated cells can be transferred to surrounding non-exposed bystander cells, known as the radiation-induced bystander effect. We investigated involvement of connexin channels and paracrine signaling in radiation-induced bystander DNA damage in brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to focused X-rays. Irradiation caused DNA damage in the directly exposed area, which propagated over several millimeters in the bystander area. DNA damage was significantly reduced by the connexin channel-targeting peptide Gap26 and the Cx43 hemichannel blocker TAT-Gap19. ATP release, dye uptake, and patch clamp experiments showed that hemichannels opened within 5 min post irradiation in both irradiated and bystander areas. Bystander signaling involved cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and IP<inf>3</inf>, ATP, ROS, and NO signaling, with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, IP<inf>3</inf>, and ROS as crucial propagators of DNA damage.

819,"Two stages of light-dependent TRPL-channel translocation in Drosophila photoreceptors Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels across species are expressed in sensory receptor cells, and often localized to specialized subcellular sites. In Drosophila photoreceptors, TRP-like (TRPL) channels are localized to the signaling compartment, the rhabdomere, in the dark, and undergo light-induced translocation into the cell body as a mechanism for long-term light-adaptation. We show that translocation of TRPL channels occurs in two distinct stages, first to the neighboring stalk membrane then to the basolateral membrane. In the first stage, light-induced translocation occurs within 5 minutes, whereas the second stage takes over 6 hours. The exclusive apical localization of TRPL channels in the first stage of translocation suggests that channels are released from the rhabdomere and diffuse laterally through the membrane into the adjoining stalk membrane. In the second stage, TRPL channels are localized in the basolateral membrane, implicating a different transport mechanism. Genetic analyses suggest that activation of the other light-activated TRP channel and eye-protein-kinase C (eye-PKC) are both required for the second stage of TRPL translocation in R1 to R6 photoreceptor cells, whereas only phospholipase C (PLC) is required for the first stage. Finally, we show that arrestin2 is required for the rhabdomeric localization and stability of TRPL channels.",Excluded
1725,"Variation of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer birefringence in normal human subjects PURPOSE: The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) exhibits linear birefringence due to the oriented cylindrical structure of ganglion cell axons. The birefringence (Deltan) depends on the density and composition of axonal organelles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distribution of birefringence around the optic nerve head (ONH) in normal subjects.METHODS: Birefringence was calculated along circular scan paths around the ONH as Deltan = R/T, where R is RNFL retardance measured by scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) and T is RNFL thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT scans on a 3.4 mm diameter circle were obtained from 26 normal subjects aged 18 to 53 years. Scans on circles with various diameters were obtained from 17 of these subjects.RESULTS: The average reproducibility of Deltan measured on three separate days in four subjects was +/- 0.05 nm/microm. In most subjects Deltan varied significantly along a circular path around the ONH, with maxima in superior and inferior bundles, minima temporally and nasally, and a mean of 0.32 +/- 0.03 nm/microm. Deltan profiles on circles of different diameter were similar, suggesting that Deltan did not vary along nerve fiber bundles.CONCLUSIONS: RNFL birefringence varies with position around the ONH. This variation may result from known structural differences among nerve fiber bundles that serve different retinal regions. Constant Deltan along bundles is consistent with this hypothesis. Measurements of RNFL birefringence may provide a means to detect early subcellular changes in glaucoma.",Excluded
3468,"Targeted sequencing and intracranial outcomes of patients with lung adenocarcinoma brain metastases treated with radiotherapy BACKGROUND: Treatment for advanced lung adenocarcinoma (AC) has become increasingly personalized based on molecular results. However, for patients with AC brain metastases (BMs), intracranial outcomes based on molecular subtype and the frequency of molecular aberrations are less well defined. This study sought to report targeted next-generation sequencing results and investigate molecularly based outcomes for patients with AC-BMs treated with radiotherapy.METHODS: The records of 132 patients with AC-BMs treated at Emory University from September 2008 to August 2016 with successful next-generation sequencing were reviewed. Rates of local disease recurrence, distant brain failure (DBF), and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were estimated using cumulative incidence with competing risk analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.RESULTS: The most common aberrations included tumor protein 53 (TP53) (60%), KRAS (29%), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (20.5%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss (15.5%), and MET amplification (13%). The majority of patients (62%) were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery alone. In these patients, KRAS mutation, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, and having >= 6 BMs were associated with an increased risk of salvage WBRT (P < .05). KRAS mutation remained significant for an increased risk of salvage WBRT when compared with EGFR/ALK/KRAS-negative patients (hazard ratio, 5.17; P < .05), despite a similar risk of DBF. PTEN loss was associated with increased risk of DBF (P < .05), whereas EGFR and ALK aberrations were associated with a decreased risk of local disease recurrence (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study quantified the frequency of genetic aberrations in patients with AC-BMs and demonstrated their association with intracranial outcomes. In particular, a cohort of patients with KRAS mutations and >=6 BMs were identified to be at high risk of requiring salvage WBRT after undergoing upfront stereotactic radiosurgery.",Excluded

We retrospectively identified 6 patients who underwent SRS twice for the same tumor. The median patient age was 47 years (range, 35-71 years). All patients had imaging evidence of tumor progression despite initial SRS. One patient also had incomplete surgical resection after initial SRS. All patients were deaf at the time of the second SRS. The median radiosurgery target volume at the time of the initial SRS was 0.5 cc and was 2.1 cc at the time of the second SRS. The median margin dose at the time of the initial SRS was 13 Gy and was 11 Gy at the time of the second SRS. The median interval between initial SRS and repeat SRS was 63 months (range, 25-169 months).RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 29 months after the second SRS (range, 13-71 months), tumor control or regression was achieved in all 6 patients. No patient developed symptomatic adverse radiation effects or new neurological symptoms after the second SRS.CONCLUSIONS: With this limited experience, we found that repeat SRS for a persistently enlarging acoustic neuroma can be performed safely and effectively.",Excluded

Using microarrays, the patterns of gene expression were established for brain, kidney, liver and spleen samples from the non-exposed offspring of irradiated CBA/Ca and BALB/c male mice. The most over-represented categories among the genes differentially expressed in the offspring of control and irradiated males were those involved in rhythmic process, circadian rhythm and DNA-dependent regulation of transcription. The results of our study therefore provide a plausible explanation for the transgenerational effects of paternal irradiation, including increased transgenerational carcinogenesis described in other studies.",Excluded

However, the delayed effect of irradiation on neuroimmune diseases has not been thoroughly examined.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the delayed effects of irradiation on the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is used as a model for neuroimmune inflammation and multiple sclerosis.METHODS: Adult male rats were exposed to a dose of 15 Gy given to the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Six months later, EAE was induced by inoculation of rat spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The disease was evaluated by clinical, histopathological and immunological parameters.RESULTS: Irradiated rats developed clinical signs of EAE earlier than the control group and their disease was much more severe. Unlike the control group, all rats in the EAE-irradiated group died within 5 days after the onset of clinical signs. Sections taken from irradiated rats showed diffuse and large hemorrhagic infiltrates of lymphocytes and granulocytes. In contrast, control rats displayed fewer infiltrates, which were less prominent and not hemorrhagic.CONCLUSIONS: CNS irradiation has a delayed effect that caused a marked aggravation of the clinical and pathological signs of EAE. The severity of the disease may be a consequence of the effect of irradiation on the CNS vascular bed and impaired blood-brain barrier.",Included

2874,"Association Between Radiation Necrosis and Tumor Biology After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastasis BACKGROUND: The primary dose-limiting toxicity of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is radiation necrosis (RN), which occurs after approximately 5% to 10% of treatments. This adverse event may worsen neurologic deficits, increase the frequency and cost of imaging, and necessitate prolonged treatment with steroids or antiangiogenic agents. Previous investigations have primarily identified lesion size and dosimetric constraints as risk factors for RN in small populations. We hypothesized that disease histology, receptor status, and mutational status are associated with RN.METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients presenting with brain metastasis between 1997 and 2015 who underwent SRS and subsequent radiographic follow-up at a single tertiary-care institution were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of radiographic RN. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to identify biological risk factors for RN.RESULTS: 1939 patients (5747 lesions) were eligible for inclusion; 285 patients (15%) experienced radiographic RN after the treatment of 427 (7%) lesions. After SRS, the median time to RN was 7.6 months. After multivariate analysis, graded prognostic assessment, renal pathology, lesion diameter, and the heterogeneity index remained independently predictive of RN in the pooled cohort. In subset analyses of individual pathologies, HER2-amplified status (hazard ratio [HR] 2.05, P=.02), BRAF V600+ mutational status (HR 0.33, P=.04), lung adenocarcinoma histology (HR 1.89, P=.04), and ALK rearrangement (HR 6.36, P<.01) were also associated with RN.CONCLUSIONS: In the present investigation constituting the largest series of RN, several novel risk factors were identified, including renal histology, lung adenocarcinoma histology, HER2 amplification, and ALK/BRAF mutational status. These risk factors may be used to guide clinical trial design incorporating biological risk stratification or dose escalation. Future studies determining the optimal timing of targeted therapies are warranted to further define the risk of RN.",Excluded

681,"Endogenous ATP involvement in mustard-oil-induced central sensitization in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (medullary dorsal horn) Central sensitization represents a sustained hypersensitive state of dorsal horn nociceptive neurons that can be evoked by peripheral inflammation or injury to nerves and tissues. It reflects neuroplastic changes such as increases in neuronal spontaneous activity, receptive field size, and responses to suprathreshold stimuli and a decrease in activation threshold. We recently demonstrated that purinergic receptor mechanisms in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc; medullary dorsal horn) are also involved in the initiation and maintenance of central sensitization in brain stem nociceptive neurons of trigeminal subnucleus oralis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether endogenous ATP is involved in the development of central sensitization in Vc itself. The experiments were carried out on urethan/alpha-chloralose anesthetized and immobilized rats. Single neurons were recorded and identified as nociceptive-specific (NS) in the deep laminae of Vc. During continuous saline superfusion (0.6 ml/h it) over the caudal medulla, Vc neuronal central sensitization was readily induced by mustard oil application to the tooth pulp. However, this mustard-oil-induced central sensitization could be completely blocked by continuous intrathecal superfusion of the wide-spectrum P2X receptor antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2, 4-disulphonic acid tetra-sodium (33-100 microM) and by apyrase (an ectonucleotidase enzyme, 30 units/ml). Superfusion of the selective P2X1, P2X3 and P2X(2/3) receptor antagonist 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (6-638 microM) partially blocked the Vc central sensitization.

639,"Firing rates and dynamic correlated activities of ganglion cells both contribute to retinal information processing In the present study, the electrical activities of paired retinal ganglion cells, under full field light stimuli with a variety of chromatic configurations, were recorded from a small functioning piece of retina using multi-electrode array (MEA). Neurons that had increased firings at light-ON and -OFF transients and did not show color-opponent properties were investigated. Single neuronal analysis showed that firing rate of each individual neuron was dependent on the intensity of illumination. Multi-unit analyses revealed that adjacent neurons often fired in synchrony in response to light stimulation. However, in some cases, the strength of correlation between the paired neurons was higher when the retina was exposed to red or green light, and the correlation was attenuated when yellow or white light was given. This seems to suggest that the ensemble activity of non-color-opponent ganglion cells might partly participate in color-information processing, with the red- and green-pathway inputs influencing each other. Such arrangement reflects principle of parsimony: the firing rates of single neuron represent the luminance intensity, and the correlated activities may tell the brain about the color information.",Excluded

This radiotracer displayed good brain penetration (3.1% of the injected dose (ID) in whole brain at 15 min post-radioligand injection). Radioligand distribution was consistent with the density of high affinity nAChRs with highest uptake observed in the nAChR-rich thalamus (14.9 %ID/g at 60 min), moderate uptake in cortex (8.5 %ID/g at 60 min), and lowest uptake in the cerebellum (2.4 %ID/g at 60 min). Pretreatment with several different nAChR agonists (A-85380, (-)-nicotine, cytisine) significantly inhibited [I-125]-5-IA binding in all brain regions studied (P < 0.01) demonstrating the high specificity of the radioligand for nAChRs.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of hypofractionated radiation therapy with concurrent temozolomide in terms of feasibility and disease control in primary glioblastoma patients with poor prognostic factors other than advanced age, such as post-surgical neurological complications, high tumor burden, unresectable or multifocal lesions, and potential low treatment compliance due to social factors or rapidly progressive disease.MATERIAL AND METHODS: GTV included the surgical cavity plus disease visible in T1WI-MRI, FLAIR-MRI and in the MET-uptake. The CTV was defined as the GTV plus 1.5-2 cm margin; the PTV was the CTV+0.3 cm margin. Forty, fourty-five, and fifty grays in 15 fractions were prescribed to 95% of PTV, CTV, and GTV, respectively. Treatment was delivered using IMRT or the VMAT technique. Simultaneously, 75 mg/m2/day of temozolomide were administered.RESULTS: Between January 2010 and November 2017, we treated a total of 17 patients. The median age at diagnosis was 68-years; median KPS was 50-70%. MGMT-methylation status was negative in 5 patients, and 8 patients were IDH-wildtype. Eight of 18 patients were younger than 65-years. Median tumor volume was 26.95cc; median PTV volume was 322cc. Four lesions were unresectable; 6 patients underwent complete surgical resection. Median residual volume was 1.14cc.

Ganglioside lipids are abundant in neuronal membranes and have been found to accelerate fibril formation [1] and to accumulate in PD brains. We address the effects of ganglioside-phospholipid (GM3-POPC) model membranes on the dynamics (regarding the order parameter and the correlation time of C-H bond reorientation) and structure of co-aggregates with alpha-synuclein using polarization-transfer 13C solid-state NMR [2], wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) and cryogenic electron microscopy. 31P NMR powder patterns were recorded to monitor the lipid phase behavior and the spinning sidebands at 1250 Hz MAS were used to fit the chemical shift anisotropy before and after coaggregation. It was found that both lipids are co-assembled with alpha-synuclein with reduced headgroup and acyl chain mobility, and that the mobility of alpha-synuclein is modulated by the lipid-to-protein ratio and membrane composition. As the ganglioside content of membranes was increased the mobility of alanine residues is affected, implying a modulation of the fibril core which could impact the fibrillation propensity. These effects of co-aggregation on alpha-synuclein fibril mobility are currently being further investigated by us and raises questions on the specific lipid-protein interactions and the organization of lipids inside coaggregates.",Excluded

2441,"The source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the goldfish: a differential irradiation protocol We have used a partial irradiation paradigm to examine the provenance of cells that participate in Wallerian cellular responses in the goldfish visual system. Animals which received 50 Gy whole-body gamma-irradiation showed virtually complete inhibition of the proliferative burst usually seen after optic nerve section. These animals did, however, show a robust hyperplastic response in the optic tract that we believe represents the migration of nearby microglial cells into the affected tract. When only the postcephalic body was irradiated, proliferating cells in the major hematopoietic organs of the fish, the kidney and pronephros, were substantially inhibited. Despite this, the Wallerian cellular response in the visual paths was essentially normal. Thus, there is no obligate requirement for peripheral proliferative cells to participate in central Wallerian degeneration in the fish. However, when only the head was irradiated, and the hematopoietic organs were spared, there was a proliferative response in the visual system. We believe this represents the invasion of the visual pathways by peripheral blood cells through the optic nerve lesion and blood vessels in the nerve itself. This invasion, however, is not sufficient to generate substantial hyperplasia. In summary, although we find evidence for a small contribution by exogenous cells, the major source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the fish is the endogenous microglia. Our data underscore the importance of elucidating the mechanisms by which microglial cells are activated and the role that they play in regeneration.",Included
1628,"Requirement for Atm in ionizing radiation-induced cell death in the developing central nervous system Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration that results from mutation of the ATM gene. However, neither the normal function of ATM in the nervous system nor the biological basis of the degeneration in AT is known. Resistance to apoptosis in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Atm-/- mice was observed after ionizing radiation. This lack of death occurred in diverse regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, which is markedly affected in AT. In wild-type, but not Atm-/- mice, up-regulation of p53 coincided with cell death, suggesting that Atm-dependent apoptosis in the CNS is mediated by p53. Further, p53 null mice showed a similar lack of radiation-induced cell death in the developing nervous system. Atm may function at a developmental survival checkpoint that serves to eliminate neurons with excessive DNA damage.",Included
3603,"Ca2+/calmodulin-binding peptides block phototransduction in Limulus ventral photoreceptors: evidence for direct inhibition of phospholipase C Phototransduction in Limulus photoreceptors involves a G protein-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent steps involving InsP3-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+. While exploring the role of calmodulin in this cascade, we found that intracellular injection of Ca2+/calmodulin-binding peptides (CCBPs) strongly inhibited the light response. By chemically exciting the cascade at various stages, we found the primary target of this effect was not in late stages of the cascade but rather at the level of G protein and PLC. That PLCdelta1 contains a calmodulin-like structure raised the possibility that PLC might be directly affected by CCBPs. To test this possibility, in vitro experiments were conducted on purified PLC. The activity of this enzyme was strongly inhibited by CCBPs and also inhibited by calmodulin itself. Our results suggest that the calmodulin-like region of PLC has an important role in regulating this enzyme.",Excluded
1509,"Segmentation of Whole-Body Images into Two Compartments in Model for Bone Marrow Dosimetry Increases the Correlation with Hematological Response in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE Treatments BACKGROUND: In <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE treatments, bone marrow (BM) is one of the most important organs at risk. The authors previously developed an image-based two-compartment method for BM dosimetry, showing a significant correlation between absorbed dose to BM and hematological toxicity in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE treatments. In the present study, they aimed to further evaluate this BM dosimetry method by finding optimal settings for dividing the whole body into two compartments; in terms of minimizing the coefficient of variation (CV) for the individual absorbed doses and studying its correlation to the BM response. The authors have also added specific absorbed fractions for male and female. Finally, they compare this two-compartment method with whole-body dosimetry.METHODS: This study included 46 patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE on two to five occasions at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Planar gamma camera images were collected at four time points postinjection, and a segmentation tool using a normalized number of uptake foci (nNUF) to divide the whole body into high- and low-uptake compartments was used. The authors characterized the two-compartment model and compared it with whole-body dosimetry.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The dosimetry method was robust, with an optimal nNUF value of 0.1-0.2. Using an nNUF value of 0.15, the absorbed BM dose was estimated as 0.20 Gy/7.4 GBq, and the CV as 8.4%. Compared to whole-body dosimetry, stronger correlation was found between absorbed dose to BM and hematological response using the two-compartment method. The two-compartment method has potential as a valuable image-based alternative to blood-based BM dosimetry.",Excluded
1704,"Interference between active implanted medical devices and electromagnetic field emitting devices is rare but real: Results of an incidence study in a population of physicians in France Background and Objective Assessing the behavior of active implanted medical devices (AIMDs) in response to electromagnetic field (EMF) transmitters is a current issue of great importance. Given the numerous telecommunication systems and our lack of knowledge as to the impact of electromagnetic effects, this study investigated the reality of possible AIMD disturbance by EMFs by interviewing health professionals. Method A self-administered postal questionnaire was sent to almost 5,000 physicians in five specialties: cardiology; endocrinology; ears, nose, and throat; urology; and neurology. It collected data on the existence and annual number of incidents observed and the conditions under which they occurred, the EMF sources involved, and the means of managing the malfunctions. Results A total of 1,188 physicians agreed to participate. Sixteen percent of participants reported cases of implant failure, three-quarters of whom, mainly in cardiology, reported rates of at least one incident per year - amounting to more than 100 incidents per year in all. Severity appeared to be moderate (discomfort or transient symptoms), but frequently required resetting or, more rarely, replacing the device. Some serious incidents were, however, reported. The sources implicated were basically of two types: electronic security systems (antitheft and airport gates) and medical electromagnetic radiation devices. These incidents were poorly reported within the public health system, preventing follow-up and effective performance of alert and surveillance functions. Conclusion Although minor, the risk of interference between EMF sources and AIMDs is real and calls for vigilance. It particularly concerns antitheft and airport security gates, though other sources may also cause incidents. Â©2013, The Authors. Journal compilation Â©2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
2769,"Effects on the photoresponse of calcium buffers and cyclic GMP incorporated into the cytoplasm of retinal rods It is generally accepted that the light response in retinal rods involves a reduction of ionic permeability (predominantly to Na+) in the plasma membrane of the outer segment and that this is mediated by an internal messenger which diffuses between the disk and plasma membranes. There is controversy, however, over the identity of the diffusible substance; two alternative schemes have received widespread support (for review see refs 1,2). According to the 'calcium hypothesis', light stimulates the release into the cytoplasm of calcium, leading to the blockage of channels which are normally open in darkness, whereas based on the 'cyclic nucleotide hypothesis', cyclic GMP causes the opening of channels in the dark, but is hydrolysed by a light-activated phosphodiesterase. We report here effects of introducing calcium buffers and cyclic GMP into the rod cytoplasm by means of a patch pipette, which seem to be inconsistent with the calcium hypothesis.",Excluded
258,"Partial mitochondrial inhibition causes striatal dopamine release suppression and medium spiny neuron depolarization via H2O2 elevation, not ATP depletion Mitochondrial dysfunction is a potential causal factor in Parkinson's disease. We show here that acute exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone (30-100 nM; 30 min) causes concentration-dependent suppression of single-pulse evoked dopamine (DA) release monitored in real time with carbon-fiber microelectrodes in guinea pig striatal slices, with no effect on DA content. Suppression of DA release was prevented by the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, implicating ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels; however, tissue ATP was unaltered. Because KATP channels can be activated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as by low ATP, we examined the involvement of rotenone-enhanced H2O2 generation. Confirming an essential role for H2O2, the inhibition of DA release by rotenone was prevented by catalase, a peroxide-scavenging enzyme. Striatal H2O2 generation during rotenone exposure was examined in individual medium spiny neurons using fluorescence imaging with dichlorofluorescein (DCF). An increase in intracellular H2O2 levels followed a similar time course to that of DA release suppression and was accompanied by cell membrane depolarization, decreased input resistance, and increased excitability. Extracellular catalase markedly attenuated the increase in DCF fluorescence and prevented rotenone-induced effects on membrane properties; membrane changes were also largely prevented by flufenamic acid, a blocker of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Thus, partial mitochondrial inhibition can cause functional DA denervation via H2O2 and KATP channels, without DA or ATP depletion. Furthermore, amplified H2O2 levels and TRP channel activation in striatal spiny neurons indicate potential sources of damage in these cells. Overall, these novel factors could contribute to parkinsonian motor deficits and neuronal degeneration caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.",Excluded
2649,"Baseline characteristics and response to GH replacement of hypopituitary patients previously irradiated for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma: data from the Pfizer International Metabolic Database OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis whether the effects of GH replacement therapy in adults could be affected by prior pituitary irradiation, the baseline characteristics and response to GH were evaluated in adults with severe GH deficiency (GHD), who had received or not irradiation for the treatment of pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma.DESIGN: Data from 447 patients, who had received radiotherapy (427 in addition to surgery), and 630 patients, who were operated on but not irradiated for their tumour, were retrieved from Pfizer International Metabolic Database (KIMS) and compared at baseline and 1 and 2 years following the onset of GH replacement.RESULTS: Irradiated and non-irradiated patients exhibited the expected phenotype of GHD at baseline. However, irradiated patients had a greater impairment in the quality of life (QoL), a higher fat mass, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and a lower bone mineral content (BMC) than non-irradiated patients. Treatment with GH induced similar changes in both groups. After 1 year of GH replacement, there was an increase in serum IGF-I and fat-free mass, a reduction in fat mass and an improvement in QoL, all changes being equivalent in irradiated and non-irradiated patients. The lipid profile also improved with the irradiated patients showing a better response. These beneficial effects were maintained and the BMC also increased in both groups by the second year of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that prior irradiation for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma does not compromise the beneficial effects of GH replacement therapy.",Included

The general living condition and the number and shape of the fungiform papillae and taste buds of the tongues were observed after the radiation in rats.RESULTS: In the group of 60Co radiation, the animals had wilting, decreasing appetite, losing weight. The heads, faces and necks of animals appeared redness, peeling of hair, increasing of secretions in 5 days after the 60Co radiation. The changes reached the summit in 10 days and the general living condition of the animals recovered in 60 days. The fungiform papillae and taste buds of the animals appeared degeneration, atrophy and collapsing in 5 days after the 60Co radiation. The injuries reached the summit in 10-20 days and the fungiform papillae and taste buds regenerated partially, and the some atrophied fungiform papillae and taste buds were not regenerated in 60 days.CONCLUSION: The damage to fungiform papillae and taste buds of tongue following the 60Co radiation with the clinical doses was very serious. The damaged fungiform papillae and taste buds can regenerate partially, but not completely.",Included

3177,"Spatial correlation of linear energy transfer and relative biological effectiveness with suspected treatment-related toxicities following proton therapy for intracranial tumors PURPOSE: The enhanced relative biological effectiveness (RBE) at the end of the proton range might increase the risk of radiation-induced toxicities. This is of special concern for intracranial treatments where several critical organs at risk (OARs) surround the tumor. In the light of this, a retrospective analysis of dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET<sub>d</sub> ) and RBE-weighted dose (D<sub>RBE</sub> ) distributions was conducted for three clinical cases with suspected treatment-related toxicities following intracranial proton therapy. Alternative treatment strategies aiming to reduce toxicity risks are also presented.METHODS: The clinical single-field optimized (SFO) plans were recalculated for 81 error scenarios with a Monte Carlo dose engine. The fractionation D<sub>RBE</sub> was 1.8 Gy (RBE) in 28 or 30 fractions assuming a constant RBE of 1.1. Two LET<sub>d</sub> - and alpha/beta-dependent variable RBE models were used for evaluation, including a sensitivity analysis of the alpha/beta parameter. Resulting distributions of D<sub>RBE</sub> and LET<sub>d</sub> were analyzed together with normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs). Subsequently, four multi-field optimized (MFO) plans, with an additional beam and/or objectives penalizing protons stopping in OARs, were created to investigate the potential reduction of LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP.RESULTS: The two variable RBE models agreed well and predicted average RBE values around 1.3 in the toxicity volumes, resulting in an increased near-maximum D<sub>RBE</sub> of 7-11 Gy (RBE) compared to RBE = 1.1 in the nominal scenario. The corresponding NTCP estimates increased from 0.8%, 0.0%, and 3.7% (RBE = 1.1) to 15.5%, 1.8%, and 45.7% (Wedenberg RBE model) for the three patients, respectively. The MFO plans generally allowed for LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP reductions in OARs, without compromising the target dose. Compared to the clinical SFO plans, the maximum reduction in the near-maximum LET<sub>d</sub> was 56%, 63%, and 72% in the OAR exhibiting the toxicity for the three patients, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Although a direct causality between RBE and toxicity cannot be established here, high LET<sub>d</sub> and D<sub>RBE</sub> correlated spatially with the observed toxicities, whereas setup and range uncertainties had a minor impact. Individual factors, which might affect the patient-specific radiosensitivity, were however not included in these calculations. The MFO plans using both an additional beam and proton track-end objectives allowed the largest reductions in LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP, and might be future tools for similar cases.",Excluded
1589,"Microglial cytokine gene induction after irradiation is affected by morphologic differentiation Microglia are known to play an important role in the CNS cytokine network, and their response after irradiation may be associated with the development of radiation-induced tissue damage. Radiation effects on this cytokine network have not yet been elucidated. We investigated the effect of gamma-irradiation on microglia stimulated with Zymosan A and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which alone induce the expression of some cytokines and neurotoxic products by microglial cells. In the resting condition (ramified microglia), radiation had no effect on the mRNA level corresponding to cytokines such as IL1beta or IL-6, although TGF-beta1 mRNA was minimally enhanced by irradiation. However, in the activated microglia (amoeboid microglia) stimulated with Zymosan A, radiation-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was increased about two-fold in comparison with non-irradiation. IL-1beta was slightly induced by 2 Gy irradiation, but was not induced by higher doses. TGF-beta1 mRNA was not enhanced by radiation following Zymosan stimulation. In the LPS-stimulated condition, IL-6 mRNA was induced only by 2 Gy of irradiation, but no change in the expression of other genes was detected. These results suggested that radiation exerted different effects on cytokine gene transcription in microglia depending on their morphological state.",Included
