4775,"Noncoplanar VMAT for Brain Metastases: A Plan Quality and Delivery Efficiency Comparison With Coplanar VMAT, IMRT, and CyberKnife. PURPOSE: To compare plan quality and delivery efficiency of noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy with coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, and CyberKnife for multiple brain metastases.METHODS: For 15 patients with multiple brain metastases, noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy, coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, and CyberKnife plans with a prescription dose of 30 Gy in 3 fractions were generated. Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy plans consisted of 4 noncoplanar arcs and 2 full coplanar arcs, respectively. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans consisted of 7 coplanar fields. CyberKnife plans used skull tracking to ensure accurate position. All plans were generated to cover 95% target volume with prescription dose. Gradient index, conformity index, normal brain tissue volume (V <sub>3Gy</sub> - V <sub>24Gy</sub>), monitor units, and beam on time were evaluated.RESULTS: Gradient index was the lowest for CyberKnife (3.49 +/- 0.65), followed by noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (4.21 +/- 1.38), coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (4.87 +/- 1.35), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (5.36 +/- 1.98). Conformity index was the largest for noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (0.87 +/- 0.03), followed by coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (0.86 +/- 0.04), CyberKnife (0.86 +/- 0.07), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (0.85 +/- 0.05). Normal brain tissue volume at high-to-moderate dose spreads (V <sub>24Gy</sub> - V <sub>9Gy</sub>) was significantly reduced in noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy over that of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy. Normal brain tissue volume for noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy was comparable with noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy at high-dose level (V <sub>24Gy</sub> - V <sub>15Gy</sub>) and larger than CyberKnife at moderate-to-low dose level (V <sub>12Gy</sub> - V <sub>3Gy</sub>). Monitor units was highest for CyberKnife (28 733.59 +/- 7197.85), followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (4128.40 +/- 1185.38), noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (3105.20 +/- 371.23), and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2997.27 +/- 446.84). Beam on time was longest for CyberKnife (30.25 +/- 7.32 minutes), followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (2.95 +/- 0.85 minutes), noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2.61 +/- 0.07 minutes), and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (2.30 +/- 0.23 minutes).CONCLUSION: For brain metastases far away from organs-at-risk, noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy generated more rapid dose falloff and higher conformity compared to intensity-modulated radiation therapy and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy. Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy provided a comparable dose falloff with CyberKnife at high-dose level and a slower dose falloff than CyberKnife at moderate-to-low dose level. Noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy plans had less monitor units and shorter beam on time than CyberKnife plans.",Excluded

3882,"Dose optimisation in computed tomography of brain using Care kV and CARE Dose4D. Background: Computed tomography scan of brain is the most widely used CT examination. CT scanners have the potential to deliver low radiation dose by utilising tube potential and tube current modulation techniques. We aim to determine the application of CARE kV (kV modulation) and CARE Dose4D (mAs modulation) in CT scan of brain. Both CARE kV and CARE Dose4D are wellestablished innovative technology of Siemens. Method(s): A prospective study was conducted from April to August 2015 at TUTH. Data were collected on a Siemens 128 slices CT scanner. Non-random purposive sampling was employed. Ethics approval was taken for every participant. Non-contrast CT images were acquired without using CARE kV and CARE Dose4D, whereas during contrast enhanced, both were turned on keeping scanning parameters constant for each individual. Result(s): A total of 72 patients (42 male and 28 female; mean age 41 years 11 +/- 18.75, maximum 87 and minimum 16) participated in this study. Body mass index was 21.97 +/- 1.90 (maximum 24.98 and minimum 18.08). The mean value of Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) before and after switching on both CARE kV and CARE Dose4D were 58.19 +/- 0.35 and 39.67 +/- 3.59 mGy, 946.67 and 652.58 mGy-cm, and 1.98 and 1.36 milli-Sievert (mSv) respectively. Conclusion(s): CARE kV and CARE Dose4D can reduce radiation dose dramatically in CT scan of brain without loss of image quality. CTDI, DLP and ED were all decreased by approximately 31% when CARE kV and CARE Dose4D were switched on.",Excluded
4808,"Radiotherapy in Combination with Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy Is a Safe and Promising Approach in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Patients with High Tumor Burden. Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy (RT) for localized-refractory or relapsed (R/R) DLBCL after chemotherapy is a standard therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy is demonstrated as a novel immunotherapy modality with impressive efficacy in R/R B-cell malignancies including DLBCL. However, CAR-T therapy is also associated with potentially fatal toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicities. Whether radiotherapy in combination with CAR-T is a better approach to enhancing efficacy and decreasing toxicity of CAR-T therapy in R/R DLBCL patients with high tumor burden remains unknown. Materials/Methods: Human CD3+T cells were separated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMS) of patients or donors by degradable anti-CD3 magnetic microbeads followed by 24h stimulation with CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibody (5ug/ml). Then CD3+T cells were transduced with humanized CAR construct targeting CD19, CD20 and CD22 and further expanded for 7 to 10 days in vitro. 14 patients with high tumor burden R/R DLBCL were enrolled in the study. Patients from 39 to 66 years of age had received two to four prior lines of therapy. 7 patients received intensive second-line chemotherapy (median age, 46 years) and 7 received radiotherapy (median age, 63 years) to debulking tumor after leukapheresis and during CAR-T cells preparation. Intensive combined chemotherapy or radiation (40 Gy in 20 fractions) were carried out for debulking condition after sequential FC regimen (cyclophosphamide 300mg/m<sup>2</sup> and fludarabine 30mg/m<sup>2</sup> X 3d) for lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Two days after FC regimen, CAR-T cells targeting CD19 and CD20 or CD22 at average dose of 1-2x10<sup>7</sup> cells for each target per kilogram (kg) were infused within 3 days. Result(s): Severe CRS (grade 3/4/5) was reported in all patients of chemotherapy cohort and mild CRS (grade 1/2) was reported in all patients of radiation cohort. 4 patients (57.1%) in chemotherapy cohort showed neurological toxicity while no patient in radiation cohort showed neurological toxicity. Comparable hematological/non-hematological toxicity and non-neurological toxicity were observed in both two groups. In chemotherapy cohort, four of seven (57.1%) patients achieved an objective response after CAR-T infusion with three of seven (42.9%) achieving a CR. In radiation cohort, seven of seven (100%) achieved an objective response after CAR-T therapy with four of seven (57.1%) achieving a CR. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that compared to intensive second-line chemotherapy, radiation is a better approach with enhanced efficacy and decreased toxicity of CAR-T therapy in R/R DLBCL patients with high tumor burden. Radiotherapy in combination with CAR-T cell infusion may be the optimal alternative treatment model of R/R DLBCL with high tumor burden. Copyright © 2019",Excluded
3798,"Outcome after spinal reirradiation for malignant epidural spinal cord compression. Radiotherapy is effective for most cases of spinal cord compression. Although recurrent spinal cord compression is a common problem, little is known about whether reirradiation preserves neurologic function and what risk of radiation myelopathy it carries. To investigate this question, we reviewed patients at the Mayo Clinic between 1975 and 1992 undergoing two or more courses of radiotherapy to the same segment of the spinal column with radiographically documented epidural disease at the time of reirradiation to determine outcome as measured by the ability to walk and by survival. Fifty- four patients met the study criteria. Radiation doses for the first course ranged from 2,250 to 5,400 cGy (median, 3,000 cGy), and total dose for all courses to the reirradiated spinal segment ranged from 3,650 to 8,089 cGy (median, 5,425 cGy). All patients were ambulatory following the first course of radiation, 40 (74%) were ambulatory at the onset of reirradiation, and 42 (78%) were ambulatory at the end of reirradiation. Thirty-seven patients (69%) remained ambulatory at their last follow-up 6 days to 80 months following reirradiation (median, 4.7 months). Five patients eventually became nonambulatory 6.5 to 35 months following reirradiation. Median survival for all patients following reirradiation was 4.2 months. We conclude that for cancer patients with progressive epidural disease following radiotherapy, reirradiation frequently preserves ambulation and carries minimal risk of radiation myelopathy during the patients' lifetime.",Excluded
3704,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer: findings from a North Central Cancer Treatment Group pooled analysis. OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (>=70 years of age) from a pooled analysis of four prospective trials.MATERIALS & METHODS: One hundred fifty-five patients with SCLC (limited stage, LSCLC, and extensive stage, ESCLC) participated in four phase II or III trials. Ninety-one patients received PCI (30 Gy/15 or 25 Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy.RESULTS: Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0 months vs. 7.6 months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR = 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p = 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR = 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p = 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p = 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery.CONCLUSIONS: PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs.",Included

4504,"Macrophage attenuation of neuronal excitability: implications for pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Brain macrophages (and microglia) play a crucial role in central nervous system immune and inflammatory responses. They are also critical cells in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. To understand how macrophages cause neural cell dysfunction, we investigated the effects of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) on rat cortical neuronal physiology in a BMDM-neuronal co-culture system using whole-cell patch clamp techniques. When co-cultured with neuronal cells, BMDMs hyperpolarized the neuronal membrane and attenuated both spontaneous and electrically evoked firings through a decrease in membrane input resistance. The average duration of evoked action potentials (APs) and the latency to fire the APs, in response to a constant depolarizing current injection, were significantly increased by BMDMs. These results indicate that BMDMs attenuate neuronal excitability. Further investigation revealed that BMDMs hyperpolarize neuronal membranes by enhancing neuronal delayed rectifier potassium current (IK), which was blocked by tetraethylammonium. This BMDM-induced attenuation on neuronal excitability may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuronal dysfunction and damage as seen in neurodegenerative disorders.",Excluded
4137,"Predicting image registration quality from the shape of the similarity metric: Potential for machine learning approaches. Purpose: Typically, image guided radiotherapy relies on rigid body (RB) image registration (IR) between a reference and localisation image. Automated IR algorithms based on iterative optimisation of a similarity metric (SM) between two images are used extensively and improve the efficiency and accuracy of this process. Occasionally these algorithms do not locate the global optimum of the SM which, if undetected, could lead to a geometric treatment error. This feasibility study uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that the location of the 'found' optimum was acceptably close to the global optimum based on measures of the SM hyper-surface. Materials: Three CBCT images and their reference CT image for each of six patients previously treated with intra-cranial radiotherapy were chosen for this study. The global optimum RB transform for each image pair was located by applying random misalignments before IR and calculating the average rigid body transform returned by the algorithm. A measure of target registration error (TRE) was calculated for each registration from the residual RB transform. IRs were classified as 'Good' (TRE < 0.6mm), 'OK' (0.6<TRE<2.5mm) or 'Poor' (TRE>2.5mm). The correlation ratio SM was calculated along the six cardinal axis of the RB transform space at intervals of 0.2mm. The shape of the SM was characterised by seven different measures describing minimum SM, accuracy and distinctiveness of optimum. These measures were used to train and test a Bayesian Network using K-fold cross validation. The machine learning process was repeated using just 25 points; the 'found' optimum and two points either siDe of the location of the 'found' optimum on the six cardinal axes of the RB transform.Three CBCT images and their reference CT image for each of six patients previously treated with intra-cranial radiotherapy were chosen for this study.

Result(s): No single characteristic of the SM curves correlated well with TRE. However, the Bayesian Network was able to correctly classify 84% of IRs based on the detailed similarity metric profiles. No 'Poor' IRs were classified as 'Good' and vice-versa. Almost identical results were achieved with the 25 point measures but one out of 449 IRs were classified as 'Good' when actually 'Poor'. Conclusion(s): This demonstrates the potential for machine learning based on the local shape of the SM hyper-surface to check likelihood of IR accuracy using only a few calculations of the SM. Such methods could be used to reassure radiation technologists when auto-IR is successful and indicate when closer scrutiny and manual adjustment of image alignment is required.",Excluded
4730,"TGFbeta1 Polymorphisms Predict Distant Metastasis-Free Survival in Patients with Inoperable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer after Definitive Radiotherapy. Purpose:Transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta1 signaling is involved in cancer-cell metastasis. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at TGFbeta1 were associated with overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. Method(s):We genotyped TGFbeta1 SNPs at rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800471 (G915C), and rs1982073 (T+29C) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in blood samples from 205 NSCLC patients who had had definitive radiotherapy at one institution in November 1998-January 2005. We also tested whether the TGF-beta1 rs1982073 (T+29C) SNP affected the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 lung cancer cells. Result(s):Median follow-up time for all patients was 17 months (range, 1-97 months; 39 months for patients alive at the time of analysis). Multivariate analysis showed that the TGFbeta1 rs1800469 CT/CC genotype was associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.463 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.012-2.114], P = 0.043) and shorter DMFS (HR = 1.601 [95% CI = 1.042-2.459], P = 0.032) and that the TGFbeta1 rs1982073 CT/CC genotype predicted poor DMFS (HR = 1.589 [95% CI = 1.009-2.502], P = 0.046) and poor brain MFS (HR = 2.567 [95% CI = 1.155-5.702], P = 0.021) after adjustment for age, sex, race, performance status, smoking status, tumor histology and volume, stage, receipt of concurrent radiochemotherapy, number of chemotherapy cycles, and radiation dose. Transfection with TGFbeta1+29C (vs. +29T) stimulated the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 cells, suggesting that TGFbeta1+29C may be linked with increased metastatic potential. Conclusion(s):TGFbeta1 genotypes at rs1800469 and rs1982073 could be useful for predicting DMFS among patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radiation therapy. These findings require validation in larger prospective trials and thorough mechanistic studies. © 2013 Yuan et al.",Excluded
3888,"A novel LITT treatment planning system to optimize laser ablation delivery to brain targets. Purpose: Laser interstitial thermal therapy, or LITT, is a minimally invasive stereotactic tumor ablative technique. One application is treating intracranial targets. LITT systems use a laser energy probe that can be inserted into the patient, emitting near infrared laser radiation that induces necrosis in clinical targets while providing thermal damage updates via MR thermometry. The rigid laser probes range two and three mm in diameter, through which the thermal energy efficiently emits along straight-line pathways. The systems allow for varying dwell times and rates of energy deposition to assist in the ability to maximize the thermal damage to the target tissues while minimizing the damage to normal tissues. For targets that cannot be treated along a linear trajectory, multiple trajectories are necessary. However, planning systems, like those available in ionizing radiation delivery, are all but absent from the clinical setting. The goals of this project aim to provide a planning system to allow the optimization of the laser trajectory. Method(s): Twelve patients who underwent LITT therapy using traditional approaches, where the surgeon decided on laser trajectory by inspection of orthogonal radiology images were post procedure planned using a rudimentary system of LITT planning. Starting with a stereotactic planning system, a thermal dose kernel was developed. This effort has provided a rudimentary tool that yields first estimates for optimized LITT. Result(s): A conformal index was developed and evaluated for each planning technique. The average index for the simple inspection of orthogonal images based on thermal dose threshold lines was 88.4% while the conformal index of the planning system were 46.2%. Conclusion(s): As with ionizing radiation, it is anticipated that this increase in thermal optimization will translate into better tumor control and lower complications. A system, with a more precise thermal predictive algorithm and automated trajectory planning is being pursued.",Excluded

The protein alpha-synuclein is the main component of Lewy bodies, the neuron-associated aggregates seen in Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative pathologies. An 11-residue segment, which we term NACore, appears to be responsible for amyloid formation and cytotoxicity of human alpha-synuclein. Here we describe crystals of NACore that have dimensions smaller than the wavelength of visible light and thus are invisible by optical microscopy. As the crystals are thousands of times too small for structure determination by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we use micro-electron diffraction to determine the structure at atomic resolution. The 1.4 A resolution structure demonstrates that this method can determine previously unknown protein structures and here yields, to our knowledge, the highest resolution achieved by any cryo-electron microscopy method to date. The structure exhibits protofibrils built of pairs of face-to-face beta-sheets. X-ray fibre diffraction patterns show the similarity of NACore to toxic fibrils of full-length alpha-synuclein. The NACore structure, together with that of a second segment, inspires a model for most of the ordered portion of the toxic, full-length alpha-synuclein fibril, presenting opportunities for the design of inhibitors of alpha-synuclein fibrils.",Excluded

4720,"Nuclear Import Receptor Inhibits Phase Separation of FUS through Binding to Multiple Sites. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-beta2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-beta2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS. Karyopherin-beta2 may act analogously to control condensates in diverse cellular contexts.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Occlusive radiation vasculopathy (ORV) predisposes head-and-neck cancer survivors to ischemic strokes.METHODS: We analyzed the digital subtraction angiography acquired in 96 patients who had first-ever transient ischemic attack or ischemic strokes attributed to ORV. Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (>70%) carotid stenoses were enrolled as referent subjects. Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from stroke onset and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches. Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded all vascular lesions, collateral status, and infarct pattern.RESULTS: ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation. In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery. In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid artery stenosis (19% versus 5%) (all P<0.05). With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery. In terms of infarct topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed infarcts were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial stroke presentation.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate our centre's experience on computed-tomography-guided (CT-guided), transforaminal, intrathecal administration of nusinersen in adult subjects with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2 and severe spinal deformity.METHOD: This is a retrospective, single-centre study investigating the feasibility and safety of CT-guided, transforaminal, lumbar puncture for the intrathecal administration of nusinersen (Spinranza R; Biogen; Cambridge, MA, USA) in a cohort of adult subjects with SMA type 2, severe neuromuscular scoliosis and previous spinal surgery. Between January 2019 and October 2019, five male, adult, SMA type 2 subjects were eligible to be treated in our centre with nusinersen. The mean age of the patients was 31 +/- 9 years (range 19-43 years). The study's outcome measures were technical success, adverse events and radiation exposure.RESULTS: In total, four patients completed the four loading doses, whilst the fifth patient received only one loading dose; two patients also received their first maintenance doses. Overall, 20 consecutive transforaminal, intrathecal treatments were analysed. Technical success was 100% (20/20 intrathecal infusions). No adverse events were documented following the procedures. Mean dose-length product (DLP) value per injection was 665.4 +/- 715.5 mGy*cm. Estimated mean effective dose per injection was 12.7 +/- 12.9 mSv. Subgroup analysis between the chronologically first 10 versus subsequent 10 procedures demonstrated a clear trend towards less radiation exposure in the latter, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (DLP: 984.7 +/- 903.3 vs. 436.7 +/- 321.5 mGy*cm, P = 0.165; respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, CT-guided transforaminal access for intrathecal injection of nusinersen was proven feasible and safe.

3959,"The ketone body s-hydroxybutyrate radiosensitizes glioblastoma multiforme stem cells. Glioblastomamultiforme (GBM) is amalignant brain tumor that typically recurs following standard treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. A rare population of radio-chemoresistant glioma stem cells (GSCs) is implicated in tumor repopulation and progression following treatment. Improvement in the prognosis of these patients requires the development of new therapeutic approaches. One emerging strategy is to target aberrant cell metabolism, a trait shared by virtually all tumor cells. The ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat, low carbohydrate and protein metabolic therapy has demonstrated anti-tumor effects alone, and in combination with radiation. The KD prolongs survival in animal glioma models, and when used in conjunction with radiation 9 of 11micewere cured of their implanted tumors. We are now extending this work to determine if the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) radiosensitizes human GSCs in vitro. The effects of betaHB on growth were examined at various betaHB concentrations in two GSC lines, L0andL1. Both 5mM and 10 mM betaHB significantly reduced GSC growth. When coupled with 4Gy of radiation, 5mM betaHB treatment significantly reduced L1 neurosphere formation and frequency, more than either betaHB treatment or radiation alone. In L0, combination treatment significantly reduced neurosphere formation and frequency, more than radiation alone. To explore underlying mechanisms we are investigating the effect of betaHB on DNA damage and repair in GSCs. Additionally, we are determining the effect of betaHB on hypoxia within GSC neurospheres by analyzing expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and the hypoxic marker carbonic anhydrase 9. We previously showed that the KD reduced the expression of these genes in a mouse glioma model. Taken altogether, these data suggest that betaHB may sensitize GBMs to radiation by inhibiting growth of both glioma cells and GSCs, which may have implications for its use to treat tumor recurrence.",Excluded

This disruption results in either mixed hypothyroidism (raised TSH with abnormal secretory kinetics) or central hypothyroidism (abnormal secretory kinetics without raised TSH). Although primary hypothyroidism is more common in the general population and cancer survivors, the cumulative incidence of central and mixed hypothyroidism is high during the ten years after cranial irradiation. Monitoring for decline in free thyroxine (FT(4)) and rise in serum TSH, and early recognition using TSH surge and TRH tests, are clinically valuable. Early thyroid hormone replacement therapy to achieve serum FT(4) in the upper half of the normal range is crucial for maintaining optimal health and growth in cancer survivors.

4820,"Ataxia-telangiectasia: a variant with altered in vitro phenotype of fibroblast cells. The clinical and cellular phenotype of ataxia telangiectasia (AT) has been extensively documented in numerous patients of different ethnic groups and is characterized by several specific laboratory hallmarks, such as chromosomal instability, profound radiosensitivity and radioresistant DNA synthesis. Several recent reports have, however, shown variations on this theme. This article describes 2 Turkish siblings with AT, who showed a typical but somewhat more prolonged clinical course of the disease and altered characteristics of fibroblast cells, compared to the 'classical' AT cellular phenotype. Fibroblast strains derived from these patients showed a normal cellular life span, moderate degrees of chromosomal instability and sensitivity to the lethal effects of X-rays and neocarzinostatin, and lack of radioresistant DNA synthesis. A compilation of the literature on 'AT variants' and 'AT-like' syndromes shows that in addition to the internal variability of AT, this disease occupies a limited segment within a large spectrum of clinical and cellular features, which are common to a variety of syndromes. Each of these syndromes covers a different segment in this spectrum. The genetic basis of this family of disorders might be complex.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: We evaluated and compared the radiographic and clinical outcomes of patients with vestibular schwannomas treated with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), 5 fractions of hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (hSRT), or 25 to 30 fractions of conventionally fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (cfSRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-six patients treated with LINAC-based SRS (median, 12.5 Gy), hSRT (25 Gy), or cfSRT (median, 54 Gy) were retrospectively reviewed. Fractionation was based on the size of the tumor, proximity to the brainstem, and potential risk of neurological sequelae. Median follow-up time was 55.2 months.RESULTS: The pretreatment median tumor diameter was significantly smaller for SRS (1.14 cm) compared with hSRT (1.7 cm) (P = .03) and cfSRT (2.0 cm) (P < .001). The overall local tumor control was 96.4%: 100% SRS, 100% hSRT, and 90% cfSRT (P = .19). Tumor regression was observed in 53.3% of SRS, 76.2% of hSRT, and 90% of cfSRT (P = .05). There was less transient expansion of tumors treated with cfSRT (5%) than with SRS (53.3%) or hSRT (28.6%) (P = .005). The median time to regression was 13.8 months for SRS, 14.2 months for hSRT, and 5.5 months for cfSRT (P = .34). There was a 3.6% incidence of grade 3 trigeminal neuropathy, but there was no grade 3 facial neuropathy.CONCLUSIONS: All 3 regimens demonstrated similar excellent local control with minimal toxicity; however, the ability of hSRT to treat larger tumors with comparable outcomes to SRS and greater patient convenience when compared with cfSRT suggest that hSRT may offer the optimal treatment approach.",Excluded

The purpose of the study was to reveal parts of the body affected by radiation most of all in uneven microwave irradiation (current frequency of 2.4 GHz/s) by the destruction criterion taking account of some indicators of the absorbed power of electromagnetic radiation (EMR). Uneven irradiation was achieved by the screening of some parts of the body with radiopaque material leaving unshielded parts subjected to irradiation. Control over the redistribution of absorbed energy was exercised by means of multichamber phantoms. In experiments on animals (female rats) within the range of specific absorbed power of 15-40 mWg the utmost affection of the cranial segment was revealed. The results show good correlation with a curve of the effect of 50% destruction criterion in total EMR irradiation.,Excluded
4188,"Proteome-wide Adaptations of Mouse Skeletal Muscles during a Full Month in Space. The safety of space flight is challenged by a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and endurance that may compromise the health and performance of astronauts. The molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy and decreased performance have been studied mostly after short duration flights and are still not fully elucidated. By deciphering the muscle proteome changes elicited in mice after a full month aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, we observed that the antigravity soleus incurred the greatest changes compared with locomotor muscles. Proteomics data notably suggested mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic and fiber type switching toward glycolytic type II fibers, structural alterations, and calcium signaling-related defects to be the main causes for decreased muscle performance in flown mice. Alterations of the protein balance, mTOR pathway, myogenesis, and apoptosis were expected to contribute to muscle atrophy. Moreover, several signs reflecting alteration of telomere maintenance, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance were found as possible additional deleterious effects. Finally, 8 days of recovery post flight were not sufficient to restore completely flight-induced changes. Thus in-depth proteomics analysis unraveled the complex and multifactorial remodeling of skeletal muscle structure and function during long-term space flight, which should help define combined sets of countermeasures before, during, and after the flight.",Included
4465,"Role of short TE 1H-MR spectroscopy in monitoring of post-operation irradiated patients. Post-surgical radiation therapy is a routine procedure in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors. Along with modest therapeutic effects conventional fractionated radiotherapy, in spite of any modifications, produces damage to non-malignant brain tissues lying within the treatment volume, the extent of which depends on radiation dose. Serial 1H-MRS allows non-invasive investigation of tissue metabolic profiles. In the present study the ratios of resonance signals assigned to the major 1H-MRS-visible metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, inositol, lactate and lipid methylene group) were evaluated before, during and after post-surgical fractionated radiotherapy in brain regions close to and more distant from the tumor bed, receiving different radiation exposures (60 and < 40 Gy, respectively). The study group consisted of ten patients (aged 28-51). A MRI/MRS system (Elscint 2T Prestige) operating at the field strength of 2 T and the proton resonance frequency of 81.3 MHz has been used and the 1H-MR spectra were acquired using single voxel double-spin-echo PRESS sequence with a short TE. The spectra were post-processed with automatic fitting in the frequency domain. It was found that although the metabolite profiles depend on the dose obtained, but other stress factors (like surgery) seem to contribute to the overall picture of the metabolic status of the brain as well. In studies of early irradiation injuries, an increase of choline related ratios may serve rather as cell proliferation indictors than as cell injury ones, whereas the mI/Cr ratio appears as one of the first indicators of local irradiation injury. In order to establish the prognostic marker for early radiation damage, however, it seems necessary to analyze all visible metabolites as well. None of the metabolites separately may serve as such an indicator due to the complexity of tissue metabolism. Interestingly, MRI reveals no changes during the therapy process, whereas the metabolite ratios are being affected in the course of time, thus supporting the presumption that the 1H-MRS is a valuable method of radiation therapy monitoring.",Excluded

Most of them were exposed to the doses of radiation meeting criteria of so-called ""low doses"": 5 - 100 cGy. The impact of these doses on human health is not fully researched; mainly it refers to mental disorders. The purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical and pathological patterns of formation of mental disorders in liquidators exposed to ""low doses"" of radiation because of the Chernobyl accident. A group of 500 liquidators was examined in a continuous research during 1995-1999 and in 2000-2001. Clinical, clinicalpsychological and psychophysiological methods were mainly used; biochemical blood analysis and functional studies also were used. Change in clinical parameters and survey results were observed in the dynamics. Primary morbidity: a separate group of ""cerebrovascular disorders"" was highlighted. In 1989 it accounted for 14 % of primary morbidity, digestive diseases - 9%, and respiratory diseases - 45 %. In 1994, vascular disorders accounted for 43 %, respiratory diseases - 7% , and the digestive diseases - 25; In 1998 cerebral vascular disorders took first place in the primary morbidity, alongside with the increase of combined diverse classes ""neoplasm"", ""endocrine system disorders"" and ""blood diseases"". Disability: In 1990 cerebrovascular disorders occupied 37 % of all cases of disability, in 1993 - 84% of all disability. These disorders consisted of 90% cerebral disorders and had a tendency to deteriorate over time. We have shown that by the year 1998-1999 the psychoorganic syndrome was presented in 65% of liquidators, and in 83% of cases because of the cerebral vascular disorders. The following clinical forms were described: affective (80%), psychopathic (14.8%), and dementic (5.2%). Over time among the liquidators the number of diseases of various organs and systems are increasing. Among these diseases, cerebrovascular disease comes first; organic CNS lesion (radiation encephalopathy) results in clinically detectable psychoorganic syndrome in the major group of examined liquidators. Thus, it can be concluded that even ""low doses"" of radiation are danger for mental health and its effect grows over time.",Included

PURPOSE: To determine whether retinal transplantation can preserve visual responses in the superior colliculus (SC) of the S334ter-line-5 rat, a transgenic model for slow photoreceptor degeneration, which is more similar to human retinitis pigmentosa than the fast degeneration line 3 S334ter rat.METHODS: Visual responses to a light flash were recorded in the SC. Rats that had received embryonic day (E) 19-20 fetal retinal sheet transplants at the age of 26-30 days were tested at the ages of 200-254 days. Controls were age-matched rats without surgery and with sham surgery. As a baseline, in no-surgery line-5 rats, the temporal pattern of visual sensitivity loss was evaluated electrophysiologically in the SC from 60 days up to one year of age.RESULTS: In untreated S334ter-line-5 rats, decline in visual sensitivity in the SC was parallel to the photoreceptor loss. At 109 day of age, a relative scotoma developed in the area of the SC corresponding to the nasal retinal region. At 200-254 days of age, the majority of the SC was devoid of any light-driven responses. In contrast, at this time point, transplanted rats with 'good' retinal grafts with normal lamination had visual responses in the caudal region of the SC, the area corresponding topographically to the transplant location in the retina. In these rats, the various parameters of SC responses such as the latency of the onset of the visual response, the response peak amplitude and the consistency of the visual response were significantly different from the control groups (no-surgery, sham surgery, 'poor' transplants) and were more comparable to normal albino rats, however, with a slightly longer latency (70-90 vs. 30-50 msec).CONCLUSIONS: Fetal retinal sheet transplantation showed a long-term rescue effect on visual function in this animal model of slow photoreceptor degeneration.",Excluded

Visual pigments in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of vertebrate retinas are highly diversified photoreceptive proteins that consist of a protein moiety opsin and a light-absorbing chromophore 11-cis-retinal. There are four types of cone visual pigments and a single type of rod visual pigment. The reaction process of the rod visual pigment, rhodopsin, has been extensively investigated, whereas there have been few studies of cone visual pigments. Here we comprehensively investigated the reaction processes of cone visual pigments on a time scale of milliseconds to minutes, using flash photolysis equipment optimized for cone visual pigment photochemistry. We used chicken violet (L-group), chicken blue (M1-group), chicken green (M2-group), and monkey green (L-group) visual pigments as representatives of the respective groups of the phylogenetic tree of cone pigments. The S, M1, and M2 pigments showed the formation of a pH-dependent mixture of meta intermediates, similar to that formed from rhodopsin. Although monkey green (L-group) also formed a mixture of meta intermediates, pH dependency of meta intermediates was not observed. However, meta intermediates of monkey green became pH dependent when the chloride ion bound to the monkey green was replaced with a nitrate ion. These results strongly suggest that rhodopsin and S, M1, and M2 cone visual pigments share a molecular mechanism for activation, whereas the L-group pigment may have a special reaction mechanism involving the chloride-binding site.",Excluded

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, 103 cranial meningioma lesions of 93 patients were treated with CyberKnife (Accurayw) Stereotactic Radiosurgery Unit. 42 patients (45%) received SRT as primary modality, and 51 patients ( 55 %) received postoperatively. Six patients have treated with external beam radiotherapy. Of the 103 cases, 69 of the lesions were located basally, 34 of them nonbasally. The most common symptoms in patients with basal tumours (38 patients, 58%) was detoriation in the visual field and the restriction of the eye movements and in patients with non-basal tumours (8 patients, 26%) was headache. In 33 patients (32%) tumours were located just adjacent to the optic apparatus or brain stem, 27 of them (26%) were located close (<1cm) to the optic apparatus or brain stem. SRT dose and fractionation were determined according to tumor localization. Optical apparatus and brainstem maximum point dose constraints for one fraction were 10 Gy and 14 Gy; 25 Gy and 30 Gy were for 5 fractions. RESULT(S): The median age was 44 (16-81). The female to male ratio was 73/20 (3.6/1). Median follow-up was 10 months (1-37 months). The median dose was 2500cGy (1500 - 3000 cGy).

UNLABELLED: A recent study from our laboratory found that (18)F-FIMX is an excellent PET radioligand for quantifying metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) in monkey brain. This study evaluated the ability of (18)F-FIMX to quantify mGluR1 in humans. A second goal was to use the relative density of mGluR1 gene transcripts in brain regions to estimate specific uptake and nondisplaceable uptake (VND) in each brain region.METHODS: After injection of 189 +/- 3 MBq of (18)F-FIMX, 12 healthy volunteers underwent a dynamic PET scan over 120 min. For 6 volunteers, images were acquired until 210 min. A metabolite-corrected arterial input function was measured from the radial artery. Four other subjects underwent whole-body scanning to estimate radiation exposure.RESULTS: (18)F-FIMX uptake into the human brain was high (SUV = 4-6 in the cerebellum), peaked at about 10 min, and washed out rapidly. An unconstrained 2-tissue-compartment model fitted the data well, and distribution volume (VT) (mLcm(-3)) values ranged from 1.5 in the caudate to 11 in the cerebellum. A 120-min scan provided stable VT values in all regions except the cerebellum, for which an acquisition time of at least 170 min was necessary. VT values in brain regions correlated well with mGluR1 transcript density, and the correlation suggested that VND of (18)F-FIMX was quite low (0.5 mLcm(-3)). This measure of VND in humans was similar to that from a receptor blocking study in monkeys, after correcting for differences in plasma protein binding. Similar to other (18)F-labeled ligands, the effective dose was about 23 muSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: (18)F-FIMX can quantify mGluR1 in the human brain with a 120- to 170-min scan. Correlation of brain uptake with the relative density of mGluR1 transcript allows specific receptor binding of a radioligand to be quantified without injecting pharmacologic doses of a blocking agent.",Excluded

However, the role of non-coding RNA and mRNA in radiation protection, especially in the nervous system, remains unknown. In this study, microarray profiles were used to determine microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of mice that were pretreated with amifostine and subsequently exposed to high-dose IR. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed. We found that fewer miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs were induced by amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice, which exhibited antagonistic effects compared to IR, indicating that amifostine attenuated the IR-induced effects on RNA profiles. GO and KEGG pathway analyses showed changes in a variety of signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses during radioprotection following amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice.

4549,"Contribution of the Atm protein to maintaining cellular homeostasis evidenced by continuous activation of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient brains. Maintenance of genome stability is essential for keeping cellular homeostasis. The DNA damage response is a central component in maintaining genome integrity. Among of the most cytotoxic DNA lesions are double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic chemicals. ATM is missing or inactivated in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. Ataxia-telangiectasia patients display a pleiotropic phenotype and suffer primarily from progressive ataxia caused by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons. Additional features are immunodeficiency, genomic instability, radiation sensitivity, and cancer predisposition. Disruption of the mouse Atm locus creates a murine model of ataxia-telangiectasia that exhibits most of the clinical features of the human disease but very mild neuronal abnormality. The ATM protein is a multifunctional protein kinase, which serves as a master regulator of cellular responses to DSBs. There is growing evidence that ATM may be involved in addition to the DSB response in other processes that maintain processes in cellular homeostasis. For example, mounting evidence points to increased oxidative stress in the absence of ATM. Here we report that the AP-1 pathway is constantly active in the brains of Atm-deficient mice not treated with DNA damaging agents. A canonical activation (increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and c-Jun) of the AP-1 pathway was found in Atm-deficient cerebra, whereas induction of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient cerebella is likely to mediate elevated expression of c-Fos and c-Jun. Although Atm(+/+) mice are capable of responding to ionizing radiation by activating stress responses such as the AP-1 pathway, Atm-deficient mice display higher basal AP-1 activity but gradually lose their ability to activate AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to ionizing radiation. Our results further demonstrate that inactivation of the ATM gene results in a state of constant stress.",Excluded

Electrical stimulation (ES) of the sciatic nerve, at 0.5 Hz with 0.6 V (supramaximal) and 1-ms pulse duration, produced twitch contractions (3.5 +/- 0.4 g tension, mean +/- S.E., n = 8 frogs), which were reduced or blocked by EMI, applied to the nerve via an induction coil, from a d.c. source of 1.5-4 V, at a frequency of 100 min-1, for 2- to 4-min duration. Recovery of the blocked twitches was obtained within 4-5 min, after the cessation of the EMI and washing out the preparation in Ringer solution. The inhibition of the twitch tension by EMI was compared to that produced by an effective concentration of a local anaesthetic, lignocaine (1 microM), which is known to block conduction, by blocking ionic fluxes across the nerve membrane. It is possible that EMI also interferes with the ionic fluxes, and in prolonged duration, may produce changes in the myelin sheath (or the Schwann cells) of the nerve membrane. A comparison of ES with EMI was made, and it was concluded that EMI inhibited electrically induced neuromuscular transmission at the frog neuromuscular junction.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequences have been very useful for MR imaging-guided deep brain stimulation procedures in Parkinson disease. However, high-quality fast spin-echo imaging deposits significant heat, exceeding FDA-approved limits when patients already have undergone deep brain stimulation and need a second one or a routine brain MR imaging for neurologic indications. We have developed a STIR sequence with an ultra-low specific absorption rate that meets hardware limitations and produces adequate tissue contrast in cortical and subcortical brain tissues for deep brain stimulation recipients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with medically refractory Parkinson disease who qualified for deep brain stimulation were imaged at 1.5T with a fast spin-echo short tau inversion recovery sequence modified to meet conditional MR imaging hardware and specific absorption rate restrictions. Tissue contrast-to-noise ratios and implant localization were objectively and subjectively compared by 2 neuroradiologists, and image quality for surgical planning was assessed by a neurosurgeon for high and low specific absorption rate images.RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio for cerebral tissues without including the contrast-to-noise ratio for ventricular fluid was 35 and 31 for high and low specific absorption rate images. Subjective ratings for low specific absorption rate tissue contrast in 77% of patients were identical to (and in a few cases higher than) those of high specific absorption rate contrast, while the neurosurgical coordinates for fusing the stereotactic atlas with low specific absorption rate MR imaging were equivalent to those of the high specific absorption rate for 69% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Parkinson disease who have already had a deep brain stimulation face a risk of neural injury if routine, high specific absorption rate MR imaging is performed.

4043,"Ganglion cells loss in non-optic neuritis eyes of MS patients. Objective: Loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in non-optic neuritis (non-ON) eyes of MS patients has recently been reported. Several factors such as anterograde degeneration initiated by abnormalities in the outer retinal layer (ORL) or inner nuclear layer (INL), or primary degeneration of RGCs themselves may contribute to this process. Alternatively, RGC loss can result from retrograde degeneration caused by sub-clinical inflammation proximal to the RGC body. In the case of optic radiation lesions such neurodegeneration would require trans-synaptic transmission. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to look for evidence of sub-clinical inflammation along the visual pathway and/or structural and functional changes in outer retina to investigate their role in RGC loss in NON-ON eyes of MS patients. Method(s): Forty NON-ON eyes of 40 RRMS patients and thirty controls were included. The thickness of the retinal layers was measured by OCT (Spectralis, Heidelberg) and analysed using custom design segmentation software. RGCs were assessed using thickness of the Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC). Structural and functional integrity of outer retina was analysed using thickness of INL and ORL and full-field electroretinogram (ERG), while multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEP) were performed to assess evidence of sub-clinical inflammation along the visual pathway. Result(s): The thickness of GCC was significantly reduced in non-ON eyes (80.4+/-7.9mu vs 87.0+/-5.5mu, p=0.0003). No significant change in INL or ORL was detected (p=0.2 and 0.06). There was also no significant change in any of the ERG parameters. The latency of mfVEP, however, was significantly delayed (p=0.00001). GCC thickness correlated significantly with latency delay of the mfVEP (r2 =0.34, p<0.001), but not with thickness of outer retina layers or any ERG parameters. There was no significant thinning of GCC (84.0+/-3.6mu, p=0.08) in patients with normal (<99th percentile) mfVEP latency (17 patients). However in patients with a delayed latency (>99th percentile, 23 patients) GCC reduction become even more apparent (78.0+/-8.9mu, p=0.00005). Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrate a significant association of RGC loss with mfVEP latency delay, indicating that sub-clinical inflammation along the visual pathway contributes significantly to neuronal damage. No evidence of primary retinal degeneration was found.",Excluded
4337,"Early changes in the integrative systems of the brain in rats during the combined action of ethanol and gamma-irradiation. [Russian]. A study was made of Wistar male rats with the body mass of 250-270 g using neurohistological, electron microscopic and biochemical methods. The animals' heads were irradiated with gamma-quanta at a dose of 50 Gy, the rate of 6.7 cGy/s. Two minutes before or right after irradiation 15% ethanol solution (0.28 and 2.25 g/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. It was established that changes of interneuronal contacts in gamma-irradiation of the head were similar in nature to those caused by ethanol (2.25 g/kg). The effects of combined action of the above factors depended on the succession of exposure and a dose of ethanol. Slightly more noticeable synaptic changes, probably associated with mitochondrion affection and hyperhydration, were noted in ethanol administration (2.25 g/kg) after irradiation of the head.",Included
3940,"Radiosurgical Lesionectomy For Cavernomas Associated With Drug Resistant Epilepsy. Purpose/Objective(s): Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain which cause hemorrhage and repetitive neurological deficits but the most frequent presenting symptom is epilepsy and is due to deposition of iron and blood products at the margin of the lesion. Microsurgical excision is preferred for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of SRS in seizure cessation for drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs. Materials/Methods: This retrospective single center study where in 11 patients with cortical or subcortical CMs located in highly functional areas with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these SRS procedures was 6yrs (+/-2.4) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 5 /month (+/-12). The mean marginal radiation dose was 18.5 Gy. Result(s): At median follow-up of 38mo, 54% were seizure free (Engel's class I), including 5 in class IA and 1 of the patients with occasional auras. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for 27% pts (class IIB). The remaining 19% patients showed little or no improvement. Outcomes were better for patients with simple partial seizures than for those with complex partial seizures. Location in the mesio-temporal region was associated with a poor outcome (2 of 11 patients), whereas location in the latero-temporal region was associated with a good outcome (5 of 11 patients). Location in the central region was also associated with an excellent outcome. Radiologically, 6 patients presented major reactional edema during the first year after SRS. In 2 of these patients, neuroradiological alterations were associated with clinical manifestations which included severe hemiparesis and speech impairment, but both patients fully recovered during the follow-up period with steroids. Post reactional edema correlates well with the response to the therapy. Conclusion(s): While radiosurgery role in controlling the bleeding in CM is controversial, it is a promising modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome.

PURPOSE: In follow-up examinations of irradiated brain metastases conventional contrast-enhanced morphological MR imaging is often unable to distinguish between transient radiation effects, radionecrosis,and tumor recurrence. To evaluate changes of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in irradiated brain metastases arterial spin-labeling techniques (ASL) were applied and compared to the outcome of (1)H MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging ((1)H MRS, SI).PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2 patients follow-up examinations of irradiated brain metastases were performed on a 1.5-T tomograph (average single dose: 20 Gy/80% isodose). Relative CBF values of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM),and metastases (Met) were measured by means of the ASL techniques ITS-FAIR and Q2TIPS. (1)H MRS was performed with PRESS 1500/135.RESULTS: In both patients with initially hyperperfused metastases (Met/GM >1) the reduction of rCBF after stereotactic radiosurgery indicated response to treatment--even if the contrast-enhancing region increased--while increasing rCBF values indicated tumor progression. The findings were confirmed by (1)H MRS, SI and subsequent follow-up.CONCLUSION: The ASL techniques ITS-FAIR and Q2TIPS are able to monitor changes of rCBF in irradiated brain metastases. The two cases imply a possible role for ASL-MR perfusion imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy in differentiating radiation effects from tumor progression.",Excluded
4221,"High dietary iron increases oxidative stress and radiosensitivity in the rat retina and vasculature after exposure to fractionated gamma radiation. Radiation exposure in combination with other space environmental factors including microgravity, nutritional status, and deconditioning is a concern for long-duration space exploration missions. Astronauts experience altered iron homeostasis due to adaptations to microgravity and an iron-rich food system. Iron intake reaches three to six times the recommended daily allowance due to the use of fortified foods on the International Space Station. Iron is associated with certain optic neuropathies and can potentiate oxidative stress. This study examined the response of eye and vascular tissue to gamma radiation exposure (3 Gy fractionated at 37.5 cGy per day every other day for 8 fractions) in rats fed an adequate-iron diet or a high-iron diet. Twelve-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four experimental groups: adequate-iron diet/no radiation (CON), high-iron diet/no radiation (IRON), adequate-iron diet/radiation (RAD), and high-iron diet/radiation (IRON+RAD). Animals were maintained on the corresponding iron diet for 2 weeks before radiation exposure. As previously published, the high-iron diet resulted in elevated blood and liver iron levels. Dietary iron overload altered the radiation response observed in serum analytes, as evidenced by a significant increase in catalase levels and smaller decrease in glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity levels. 8-OHdG immunostaining, showed increased intensity in the retina after radiation exposure. Gene expression profiles of retinal and aortic vascular samples suggested an interaction between the response to radiation and high dietary iron. This study suggests that the combination of gamma radiation and high dietary iron has deleterious effects on retinal and vascular health and physiology.",Included

Background and objectives: Radiation treatment in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known to be associated with increased prevalence of carotid stenosis. The objectives of the study was to determine the prevalence of radiation-induced extracranial carotid stenosis, plaque, carotid intima thickness (CIMT) in NPC patients; to explore whether the stenosis is due to direct effect of radiation rather than general tendency to atherosclerosis. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the University Malaya Medical Centre from July 2011 to February 2012. The study subjects consisted of 47 NPC patients who were treated with radiation, and 47 healthy control. The patients and control had carotid duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler (TCD). Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, the time lapse from radiation was 76.7 +/- 95.3 months. Internal carotid artery (ICA) and common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis of >=50% was seen in 17.0% of patients vs 2.1 % of controls (p = 0.031), with 61.7% of patients and 19.1% of controls having plaque in ICA and CCA (p=0.004). CIMT was increased in 70.2% of patients and 44.7% of controls (p =0.022). Both the patient group and control had similar rate of intracranial stenosis of 12.8% in TCD. Conclusion(s): Extracranial internal carotid artery is the most common site of stenosis following radiotherapy in NPC. This suggests that local trauma from irradiation is the most important factor in predisposition to atherosclerosis following radiation therapy.",Included
3876,"PCI-no. What does prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) prevent in ED-SCLC? - Why isn't the presence of brain metastasis evaluated before performing PCI? Background: In a European trial, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was performed on patients with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer (ED- SCLC). As a result, PCI was reported to reduce the incidence of symptomatic brain metastasis and to prolong patient survival. However, their treatments were completely different from our routine medical care. For example, they did not perform tests to examine whether there was a metastatic brain tumor before assignment to the PCI group or observation group and, after assignment, symptoms alone were observed and no imaging test was performed. For this reason, in Japan, we corrected this inconsistency of protocol and repeated the trial to determine whether PCI contributes to prolonged survival. Participants and Method: Included in the current trial were patients who underwent two or more cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy, had achieved at least stable disease (SD), and had no metastatic brain tumor on their MRI. They were randomly assigned to either the PCI group or observation group. Follow-up with brain, chest and abdominal diagnostic imaging tests was performed every three months in both groups. Result(s): In the first pre-specified interim analysis, it was found that there was no possibility of improving patient prognosis using PCI even if the trial were continued. An independent data monitoring committee therefore terminated the trial. At that time, 224 cases had already been enrolled, with 113 cases assigned to the PCI group and 111 cases to the observation group. Median survival period in the final analysis was 11.6 months for the PCI group and 13.7 months for the observation group (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.68). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups, but PCI actually tended to make the prognosis somewhat worse or, at least, did not improve prognosis in patients with ED-SCLC. Discussion(s): The biggest difference between the two trials was whether follow-up assessments were conducted using symptoms or brain MRI. In the current trial, it is impossible to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic brain metastasis cases; however, in the European trial, asymptomatic brain metastasis cases were also included, which means that there were in fact two different subgroups in the PCI group: a subgroup of patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis undergoing therapeutic cranial irradiation and a subgroup of patients without brain metastasis undergoing true PCI. It seems that the survival difference between patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis in the PCI group and in the observation group caused the apparent improvement of survival period. On the other hand, it is conjectured that PCI generated a lot of toxic effects in the patients without brain metastasis and that their survival curve tended to be inferior. PCI is a treatment to prevent new brain metastasis. One year of PCI reduces the incidence of new brain metastasis in no more than 30% of cases. For patients with MRI showing no metastatic brain tumor, needless PCI can be avoided by performing regular brain imaging tests, without impairing survival.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess tumor vascularity of the brain by dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR imaging and to determine whether this method is clinically useful for monitoring radiation effects on brain tumors. We, furthermore, compared DSC MR imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid human serum albumin (99mTc-HSA-D) in the assessment of tumor vascularity in a limited numbers of cases.METHODS: Twelve patients with various kinds of brain tumors were studied. DSC MRI was performed on all patients before and after radiation therapy. SPECT using 99mTc-HSA-D was also performed in five patients. The rate of change in tumor blood volume in response to radiation therapy was evaluated with DSC MRI and SPECT. The rate of change in tumor volume in response to radiation was also measured.RESULTS: Ten patients were successfully studied. The rate of change in tumor blood volume correlated well between DSC MRI and SPECT. There was no significant correlation between the rates of change for tumor blood volume and tumor volume. Changes in tumor vascularity preceded the reduction in tumor volume seen following radiotherapy.CONCLUSION: DSC MRI provides information regarding radiation effects on tumor vessels that is not available with conventional MRI.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To measure leakage ambient dose equivalent H*(10) from stray secondary neutron and photon radiation around proton therapy (PT) facility and evaluate adequacy of shielding design.METHODS AND MATERIALS: H*(10) measurement were carried out at 149 locations around cyclotron vault (CV), beam transport system (BTS) and first treatment room (GTR3) of a multiroom PT facility using WENDI-II and SmartIon survey meter. Measurement were performed under extreme case scenarios wherein maximum secondary neutrons and photons were produced around CV, BTS and GTR3 by stopping 230MeV proton of 300nA on beam degrader, end of BTS and isocenter of GTR3. Weekly time average dose rate (TADR) were calculated from H*(10) value measured at selective hot spots by irradiating actual treatment plans of mix clinical sites.RESULTS: The maximum total H*(10) were within 2 microSv/hr around CV, 5 microSv/hr around outer wall of BTS which increases up to 62 microSv/hr at the end of inside BTS corridor. Maximum H*(10) of 20.8 microSv/hr in treatment control console (P125), 23.4 microSv/hr behind the common wall between GTR3 and GTR2 (P132) and 25.7 microSv/hr above isocenter (P99) were observed around GTR3. Reduction of beam current from 6 to 3 nA and 1 nA at nozzle exit lead to decrease in total H*(10) at P125 from 20.8 to 11.35 and 4.62 microSv/hr. In comparison to extreme case scenario, H*(10) value at P125, P132 and P99 from clinically relevant irradiation parameters were reduce by a factor ranging from 8.6 for high range cube to 46.4 for brain clinical plan. The maximum weekly TADR per fraction was highest for large volume, sacral chordoma patient at 8.5 microSv/hr compare to 0.3 microSv/hr for brain patient. The calculated weekly TADR for 30 mix clinical cases and 15 fractions of 1 L cube resulted total weekly TADR of 83-84 microSv/hr at P125, P132 and P99. The maximum annual dose level at these hot spots were estimated at 4.37 mSv/Yr.CONCLUSION: We have carried out an extensive measurement of H*(10) under different conditions. The shielding thickness of our PT facility is adequate to limit the dose to occupational worker and general public within the permissible stipulated limit. The data reported here can bridge the knowledge gap in ambient dose around PT facility and can also be used as a reference for any new and existing proton facility for intercomparison and validation.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: First extensive investigation of neutron and photon H*(10) around PT facility and can bridge the knowledge gap on ambient dose.",Excluded
3842,"High resolution dual-tracer brain SPECT with a new highperformance CdTe detector. Aims: Simultaneous dual-tracer brain imaging has the potential to shorten patient pathways in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, but the poor spectral resolution of conventional gamma cameras limits the utility of this technique. Solid state detectors offer improved capability to distinguish between two radioisotopes, and this has been exploited clinically in the field of nuclear cardiology. However, the technology has yet to be fully evaluated in the field of scintigraphic neuroimaging. We present imaging results for a new small-pixel CdTe detector in simultaneous dual-radioisotope scintigraphy of a brain phantom. Method(s): We have developed a new high-performance CdTe detector with an array of 80x80 pixels on a 250mum pitch, capable of imaging x-rays and gamma rays up to 200keV. The detector is fully spectroscopic, recording the energy of every interaction in each pixel of the detector, and the small pixel size affords very high spatial- and spectral- resolution. The detector has a wide range of applications in medical imaging, including x-ray diffraction tomography, x-ray k-edge subtraction and highresolution nuclear medicine imaging. The new detector has been characterised for radionuclide imaging. Using pinhole collimation, images have been acquired of a brain phantom containing both I-123 and Tc-99m. The hyperspectral dataset was subjected to corrections for inter-pixel charge sharing, variations in energy and uniformity response, and bad pixel interpolation. Images were created by applying energy windows to the spectral data. Images and spectra of the same phantom were also acquired with a conventional clinical gamma camera for comparison. For each image, the contrast and cross-talk between the two energy windows were quantified using regions of interest. Result(s): The CdTe system exhibits improved scatter rejection and greatly reduced cross-talk between the energy windows for the two radioisotopes, resulting in enhanced image contrast. These characteristics will allow for better accuracy for quantitative imaging in a dual-tracer setting, which has particular importance in brain imaging. We also demonstrate the ability of the detector to resolve low-energy fluorescence x-rays from the radioactive source. The system has a high efficiency for detection of these low-energy photons, and incorporating these events into image reconstruction may boost the sensitivity, reducing image noise. Conclusion(s): Small-pixel CdTe detectors are a promising prospect in multi-tracer SPECT imaging. We present future plans to develop the instrument, with a tiled array of detectors with minimal dead-space to increase the field of view and improved collimators to further increase the sensitivity of the system.",Excluded

4458,"The coupling between synaptic vesicles and Ca2+ channels determines fast neurotransmitter release. In order to release neurotransmitter synchronously in response to a presynaptic action potential, synaptic vesicles must be both release competent and located close to presynaptic Ca2+ channels. It has not been shown, however, which of the two is the more decisive factor. We tested this issue at the calyx of Held synapse by combining Ca2+ uncaging and electrophysiological measurements of postsynaptic responses. After depletion of the synaptic vesicles that are responsible for synchronous release during action potentials, uniform elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by Ca2+ uncaging could still elicit rapid release. The Ca2+ sensitivity of remaining vesicles was reduced no more than 2-fold, which is insufficient to explain the slow-down of the kinetics of release (10-fold) observed during a depolarizing pulse. We conclude that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to sites where Ca2+ channels cluster, rather than fusion competence, is a limiting step for rapid neurotransmitter release in response to presynaptic action potentials.",Excluded
4013,"How the use of CBCT and MRI has changed our management of cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma remains a clinical diagnosis but today imaging has become an important cornerstone in the diagnostic work-up of this condition. Conebeam CT offers a much higher resolution of the interface between bone, air and soft tissue, while the associated irradiation dose is substantially lower, as compared to multi-detector CT scans. As such, CBCT has become very useful for the pre-op work-up of patients with cholesteatoma showing with precision bony erosion of the ossicular chain and erosion of the petrous bone (as fistulae, perilabyrinthine erosion, intracranial invasion). Also the aeration of theME-cleft is shown (important for the functional prognosis) and important preoperative landmarks warn the surgeon for eventual pitfalls. The advent of the non-EP diffusion weighted sequence in MR-imaging makes this sequence a very useful adjunctive tool in the pre-op work-up of cholesteatoma cases specially in cases suspected of intralabyrinthine spread, or extension medial to the otic capsule or intracranial invasion. Its today almost undisputed value has been demonstrated in the postoperative follow-up of cholesteatoma by the high sensitivity and specificity (in most studies well above 90%). By this innovation many ""unnecessary"" (because absence of residual pathology) second stage operations can today be avoided. Advantages and limitations of the two imaging techniques will be discussed. An algorithm usefull in clinical practice will be proposed.",Excluded

3912,"F43polygenic Risk of Major Depressive Disorder Is Associated with White Matter Microstructure: Evidence from Uk Biobank Imaging Study of 9,748 Participants. Background: Previous cohort studies have shown that the onset of Major depressive disorder (MDD) is related to alterations in white matter microstructure in the brain, especially in the tracts that involve in emotional processes such as the thalamic radiations. Earlier attempts to identify any associations between MDD polygenic risk (MDD-pgrs) and white matter microstructure have so far been heterogeneous. In the present study, we used the polygenic risk scores created based on the summary statistics from PGC and the imaging data from UK Biobank (N= 9,748) to test for an association between brain structural connectivity and MDD genetic risk. Method(s): We used IDPs (imaging-derived phenotypes) from UK Biobank imaging project. The imaging data was collected on a single scanner and preprocessed in FSL by UK Biobank. 15 major white matter tracts were extracted. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were used as measures for white matter microstructure (higher integrity is associated with higher FA or lower MD). Regression models were applied to test the associations of MDD or MDD-pgrs with white matter microstructure. All effect sizes reported were significant after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple testing. Result(s): At MDD-pgrs threshold of pT<0.01, MDD-pgrs was associated with a general factor of global white matter microstructure for both FA and MD (FA: beta=-0.027, p=4.51e-3; MD: beta=0.034, p=2.53e-4). At this same threshold, we found a significant association between MDD-pgrs and lower FA in the medial lemniscus (beta=-0.034, pcorrected=7.12e-4), superior thalamic radiation (beta=-0.031, pcorrected=8.79e-3), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (beta=-0.034, pcorrected=7.12e-4), forceps major (beta=-0.026, pcorrected=0.027), and forceps minor (beta=-0.025, pcorrected=0.027). For MD, all the above tracts were significant (beta ranged from 0.018 to 0.034, pcorrected ranged from 4.28e-4 to 0.013), apart from the medial lemniscus. In addition, several additional tracts also showed significant associations with MD, including the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, posterior thalamic radiation, anterior thalamic radiation, uncinate fasciculus, and acoustic radiation (beta ranged from 0.025 to 0.039, pcorrected ranged from 4.28e-3 to 0.047). Discussion(s): MDD-pgrs at the pT<0.01 was associated with reduced white matter microstructure in UKB participants. Significant results were found at other thresholds, but the pT<0.01 showed the most significant and anatomically widespread associations. Results from the latest MDD GWAS that showed the top hits and pathways are mostly associated with neuronal processes. Our findings indicate that the neuronal pathways impacted in MDD may have downstream effects on white matter microstructure. Disclosure: Nothing to disclose. Copyright © 2018",Excluded

4701,"Altered expression of glutamate transporter GLAST mRNA in rat brain after photochemically induced focal ischemia. BACKGROUND: The neurotransmitter glutamate is involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Glutamate released from presynaptic terminals must be removed rapidly from the synaptic cleft by high affinity, sodium-dependent glutamate transporters to keep the extracellular glutamate concentration low to protect neuron from glutamate excitotoxicity, which is the major pathological mechanism of brain ischemia. GLAST is one of the identified four subtypes of the glutamate transporter system and has been suggested to play an important role in some pathological conditions. But until recently, very little information existed the concerning relationship between GLAST expression and cerebral ischemia.METHODS: Nonradioactive in situ hybridization was employed to evaluate the changes of glutamate transporter GLAST mRNA expression in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus following photochemically induced focal cortical ischemia.RESULTS: GLAST mRNA expression in cerebral pyramid cells below the infarcted area did not change at 3 h, significantly decreased at 12 h, recovered to the control level at 24 h, and significantly increased at 72 h following the ischemic lesion. No changes in GLAST mRNA expression were observed in all subfields of the hippocampal complex.CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that the time-course changes of GLAST mRNA expression after ischemia may be correlated with the pathogenesis of photosensitive ischemic brain damage.",Excluded

Background: Older adults with NSCLC with no comorbidities are at risk of under treatment after initial diagnosis while those with severe comorbidities are at risk of over treatment. However, national data on how age and comorbidity impact treatment of recurrent NSCLC are limited. Method(s): Through a special study mechanism of the National Cancer Database, we randomly selected 9668 patients with surgically resected stage I-III NSCLC in 2006-07 from 1147 cancer facilities. Registrars reabstracted detailed preoperative comorbidity, recurrence, and treatment information to supplement existing data. Patients were stratified by recurrence status and predictors of active treatment vs supportive care only were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Result(s): Median age at diagnosis was 67 (IQR 60-74). The most common comorbidities were COPD (40%) and CAD (21%). After 5-year median follow up, 62% had no recurrence, 11% had locoregional, and 27% had distant recurrence. Among those with locoregional recurrence, 79% received treatment (28% chemo, 25% chemo/radiation, 16% radiation, 10% surgery); 21% received supportive care only. Older patients (adjusted OR 0.73 per decade, p = .0008) and those with substance abuse (aOR 0.41, p = .008) were less likely to receive treatment. Women and patients with symptomatic or ipsilateral lung recurrence (vs lymph node) were also less likely to receive treatment (all p < .02). Among those with distant recurrence, 77% received treatment (30% radiation, 23% chemo, 13% chemo/radiation, 11% surgery); 23% received supportive care only. Older patients were less likely to receive treatment (aOR 0.75, p = .0001) while those without any comorbidities were more likely to receive treatment (aOR 1.65, p = .018). Metastatic site also predicted treatment: contralateral lung or liver metastases decreased the odds of treatment while brain or bone metastases increased the odds (all p < .05). Conclusion(s): Older patients, independent of comorbidity, were less likely to receive treatment for both locoregional and distant NSCLC recurrence. In contrast, the impact of comorbidity was stronger for distant recurrence, highlighting the importance of avoiding over treatment in the palliative setting.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of noncoplanar volumetric modulated arc stereotactic radiotherapy (VMAT-SRT) using a 5-mm multileaf collimator (MLC) for multiple brain metastases. We identified 34 multiple-target cases (3 to 19 targets in each case) with a total of 257 of targets and constructed noncoplanar VMAT-SRT plans using 5-mm and 2.5-mm MLCs with 4-arc. The prescribed dose was 36 Gy/6 fr. Plans were evaluated using the Paddick conformity indices (PCI), Paddick gradient index (PGI), and normal brain dose (NBD, equal to the mean brain dose minus gross tumor volume). There were no significant differences in PCI (median [range]: 5 mm, 0.88 [0.78 to 0.94]; 2.5 mm, 0.89 [0.78 to 0.94]; p= 0.691), PGI (median [range]: 5 mm, 3.96 [2.21 to 6.63]; 2.5 mm, 3.96 [2.24 to 6.45]; p= 0.358), or NBD (median [range]: 5 mm, 7.5 Gy [2.5 to 12.4]; 2.5 mm, 7.5 Gy [2.5 to 12.5]; p= 0.675). The performance of the 5-mm MLC was not inferior to the 2.5-mm MLC in applications of noncoplanar VMAT-SRT for multiple brain metastases with regards to dose conformity, gradient, and NBD.

We evaluated our experience with radiosurgical and microsurgical treatment alone and in combination for the management of NVCNS.METHODS: The charts of 62 patients with NVCNS who were treated between 1993 and 2005 at our institution were reviewed. Patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The patients underwent microsurgery and/or radiosurgery treatment.RESULTS: Trigeminal and jugular foramen schwannomas were the most common NVCNS tumors (n = 47), and the only two groups with sufficient numbers of patients to allow comparison of the three treatment approaches. In these two groups, the mean tumor volume was significantly higher in those who received combined therapy (8.59 +/- 2.29 cc), compared with radiosurgery (4.94 +/- 3.02 cc; p = 0.05) or microsurgery alone (5.38 +/- 3.23; p = 0.027). Patients who underwent radiosurgery alone were significantly older (67.7 +/- 13.3 years; p = 0.019) than those treated with microsurgery (55.3 +/- 13.7 years) or with both modalities (48.7 +/- 12.8 years). The Karnofsky Performance Scale scores were significantly higher (p < or = 0.05) at follow-up compared with baseline for all three treatment approaches. There was no significant change in the Glasgow Outcome scores before and after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgery and radiosurgery can both be used to manage NVCNS tumors with excellent results. When treatment with either modality alone is not reasonable, tumors can be managed effectively with combined micro- and radiosurgery treatment.",Included

3836,"Epidemiology and molecular pathology of glioma. Gliomas account for almost 80% of primary malignant brain tumors, and they result in more years of life lost than do any other tumors. Glioblastoma, the most common type of glioma, is associated with very poor survival, so glioma epidemiology has focused on identifying factors that can be modified to prevent this disease. Only two relatively rare factors have so far been conclusively shown to affect glioma risk--exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, and inherited mutations of highly penetrant genes associated with rare syndromes. In addition, preliminary evidence points to a lower glioma risk among people with allergic conditions and high levels of serum IgE. Recent research has focused on identifying germline polymorphisms associated with risk of glioma, and using molecular markers to classify glial tumors into more-homogenous groups. Because gene products probably interact with environmental factors or developmental signals to produce gliomas, large studies are needed to analyze associations between polymorphisms and glioma. Cohort studies of immune factors and glioma risk are being undertaken to validate the results of case-control studies. Studies of polymorphisms of genetic pathways with strong prior hypotheses are being planned, and whole-genome scans are being proposed to study high-risk families and case-control series. The Brain Tumor Epidemiology Consortium has been formed to co-ordinate these studies. [References: 69]",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathologic features of delayed radiation-induced brain injury after radiotherapy for brain tumor.METHODS: The clinical, histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of 9 cases with delayed radiation-induced injury were evaluated.RESULTS: The disease occurred from 6 months to 12 years after radiotherapy and often presented with headache and muscle weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging showed peripheral enhancing lesions with slight mass effect and surrounding edema. Microscopically, the major changes included coagulative necrosis, fibrinoid necrosis of vessels, vascular hyalinization with luminal stenosis and peripheral reactive gliosis. Immunostaining for hypoxia-inducible factors 1alpha was positive in reactive astrocytes.CONCLUSIONS: Delayed radiation-induced brain injury is a relatively common complication of radiation therapy. The lesion was frequently misdiagnosed as brain tumor. Correct diagnosis relies on clinical, radiologic and pathologic correlation.",Excluded
4411,"The H reflex from the abductor brevis hallucis muscle in healthy subjects. In order to evaluate the clinical applicability of a neurophysiological technique, information is required about the effect of technical and subjective factors on the measured parameters, and whether these measures are reliable. The reliability of measurement of a given parameter is inversely related to the variability shown by a set of measurements of that parameter made on the same subject under similar conditions. Reliable measures are fundamental to the clinical utility of any technique. We evaluated the reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and assessed both single-point and test-retest normal limits for H-reflex parameters of abductor brevis hallucis (ABH). The H reflex from the ABH muscle was recorded in 36 of 43 subjects, but could not be elicited in 7 of 11 subjects who were >60 years of age. The Hmax latency increased as height increased, whereas Hmax amplitude and Hmax/Mmax amplitude ratio decreased as age and height increased. The Hmax latency and Hmax/Mmax amplitude ratio, but not Hmax amplitude, proved to be reliable. The usefulness of the H reflex from ABH in the evaluation of S2 radiculopathies is described.",Excluded

After adaptation to cyclic illumination (14:10 light-dark cycle; intensity = 1.4 log ftc) male albino rats were exposed to brighter light (2.15 log ftc) seven hours daily for 25 days. The extent of retinal damage was determined histologically. Daily exposure to bright light in the morning produced greater photoreceptor loss than daily afternoon exposure. Severe retinal damage was partially prevented by brief light adaptation (20 minutes duration, at 1.4 log ftc intensity) before the onset of morning exposure. However, light adaptation did not remove the differential effect of time of day. The authors conclude that increased light exposure during the period of rod outer segment phagocytosis enhances photoreceptor damage.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: Carcinoid tumors belong to the group of neuroendocrine tumors whose cells are part of the APUD system, with the place of origin being most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract (more often the appendix). Pulmonary involvement can be seen in about 0.5 % to 2% with no difference between gender, usually in patients above 60 years old, with no correlation with smoking, radiation or chemicals. It may have prognostic variables, from the kindness of a tumor without local infiltration to metastatic and life threatening tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: MAS, male, 25 years old, resident of interior of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, workman. Six years before our first consultation, the patient presented minor bleeding with probable origin in the respiratory tract, considered initially a nasal origin. Sporadic, with no relation to climate change, physical exertion or other triggering factors. Denied other signs or symptoms. Was requested chest and sinus radiography, without alterations. Requested a CT of the chest which showed consolidation with aerobronchograms located in the apical and anterior segment of the left lower lobe. Laboratory tests without relevant findings, with negative bacillus alcohol acid resistant, culture for M. tuberculosis in sputum and serum tests for fungi. We opted for conservative treatment. Two years after the initial event, he searched pulmonology service for monitoring, and it was requested new chest CT, which showed nodule with partial bronchial obstruction and onset of the consolidation in the adjacent parenchyma. Again, the position assumed was to maintain observation of the evolution of the framework due to the absence of clinical expression. Elapsed two more years, he presented episodes of bleeding associated with cough and sneezing, more intensely. Searched otolaryngologist who requested laryngoscopy, which showed no abnormalities that could justify the symptoms. He was then referred to our clinic and brought all previously obtained material, including a new request of chest CT. He referred hemoptoics, progressive dyspnea and wheezing. Denied fever, purulent sputum expectoration, weight loss or other constitutional symptoms. Ordered additional tests including ESR (51mm ), DHL (217 UI/L), PCR (26mm ) , CEA (1.4 ng / dL), negative serology for fungi, noreactive Mantoux test. Pulmonary function tests: FVC: 2.36(46%)-2.43(47% )-(change 3%), FEV<inf>1</inf>:1.59(37%)-1.83 (43 %)-(change15%), FEV<inf>1</inf>/FVC:67% - 75%, DLCO 23,8( 1%). The previously requested tomography brought showed nodule of 3.9 cm in the left lower lobe with soft tissue attenuation, promoting partial bronchial obstruction and leading to areas of adjacent consolidation. With these results, it was requested bronchoscopy. Evolved unfavorably with intensification of the bleeding, which made us chose hospitalization for monitoring. Bronchoscopy revealed tumor mass partially obstructing the left lower lobe bronchus, infiltratating with bleeding lips. Before the results of the histopathological analysis, he evolved with intensified bleeding, with risk of death.Referred to thoracic surgery. Performed left lower lobectomy, which was uneventful and he had complete recovery. The analysis of material obtained through fiberoptic bronchoscopy as part of the surgery proved to be a typical carcinoid tumor. DISCUSSION: Carcinoid tumors represent 1% to 2 % of cancers affecting the lung, with higher incidence in age above 60 years. Presents an indolent growth and may remain asymptomatic for several years, with the first manifestations being the presence of hemoptysis and dyspnea.It can produce metastasis, leading to carcinoid syndrome, characterized by a systemic clinical picture. For diagnosis it should take into account the correlation of imaging tests and biopsy either via endoscopic or thoracotomy, depending on the location of the tumor or the physician's choice. The curative treatment is done surgically with resection of the tumor. CONCLUSION(S): Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are rare and should be part of the differential diagnosis of lung neoplasms with nonspecific manifestations. When diagnosed, it has a favorable prognosis. The treatment of choice is surgical resection.",Excluded
4282,"Limited disease small cell lung cancer: alternating combination of doxorubicin, etoposide, ifosfamide and hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Final results of a multicentric pilot study for the Groupe Lyonnias d'Oncologie Thoracique (GLOT). In order to evaluate the effect on prolonging survival of alternating chemotherapy and radiotherapy schedules in patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer, 89 patients were included in a multi-institutional pilot study between January 1986 and May 1989. Treatment consisted of induction chemotherapy using the combination of doxorubicin, etoposide and ifosfamide (AVI) for four consecutive courses, followed by two cycles of the VI chemotherapy alternating with three hyperfractionated radiotherapy courses and then followed by two additional courses of AVI. Objective response to the four cycles of AVI combination was observed in 65 patients (75%). Thirteen out of 30 patients (44%) who were in partial response (PR) after induction chemotherapy were converted into complete response (CR) after the three alternating courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The principal side effect related to combined modality treatment was acute radiation pneumonitis (21.5% cases) reversible except one which resulted in toxic death, and a second with chronic lung fibrosis with permanent WHO Grade 2 dyspnea (14%). Local relapse was observed in 47% of the patients who were considered in CR at the end of the treatment program and cerebral metastases were the first site of detectable relapse in 25% cases. The 3-year actuarial disease-free survival of the 89 patients is 5%, and the median actuarial survival is 14 months. This study shows that the promising survival rates seen in our previously published interim analysis were not maintained. Reasons for this might include the choice of a non cisplatinum containing induction chemotherapy, the late introduction of thoracic irradiation and/or to the use of non-restrictive criteria for selecting patients.",Excluded

Accordingly, in this study, we used magnetic graphene oxide (NGO/SPIONs) nanoparticles coated with PLGA polymer as a dynamic nanocarrier for IUdR and, evaluated its sensitizing enhancement ratio in combination with a single dose X-ray at clinically megavoltage energies for treatment of C6 glioma rats. Nanoparticles were characterized using Zetasizer and TEM microscopy, and in vitro biocompatibility of nanoparticles was assessed with MTT assay. IUdR/MNPs were intravenously administered under a magnetic field (1.3 T) on day 13 after the implantation of C6 cells. After a day following the injection, rats exposed with radiation (8 Gy). ICP-OES analysis data indicated an effective magnetic targeting, leading to remarkably improved penetration through the BBB. In vivo release analysis with HPLC indicated sustained release of IUdR and, prolonged the lifespan in plasma (P <.01). In addition, our findings revealed a synergistic effect for IUdR/MNPs coupled with radiation, which significantly inhibited the tumor expansion (>100%), prolonged the survival time (>100%) and suppressed the anti-apoptotic response of glioma rats by increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (2.13-fold) in compared with the radiation-only. In conclusion, besides high accumulation in targeted tumor sites, the newly developed IUdR/MNPs, also exhibited the ability of IUdR/MNPs to significantly enhance radiosensitizing effect, improve therapeutic efficacy and increase toxicity for glioma-bearing rats.

4167,"Evaluation of novel modified tangential irradiation technique for breast cancer patients using dose-volume histograms. Purpose We have previously reported that entire axillary lymph node regions could be irradiated by the modified tangential irradiation technique (MTIT). In this study, MTIT was compared with a conventional irradiation technique (CTIT) using dose-volume histograms to verify how adequately MTIT covers the breast and axillary lymph node region and the extent to which it involves the lung and heart. Methods and materials Forty-four patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated by lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy. Twenty-two patients were treated with MTIT and 22 with CTIT. In 25 patients, the breast tumor was on the left and in 19 on the right. During axillary dissection, surgical clips were left as markers at the border of the axillary lymph node region. MTIT was planned by setting the dorsal edge of the radiation field on a lateral-view simulator film at the dorsal edge of the humeral head and the cranial edge of the radiation field at the caudal edge of the humeral head. CTIT was planned to ensure radiation of the breast tissue without considering the axillary region. In this study, all patients underwent computed tomography, and the CT data were transmitted on-line to a radiotherapy planning system, in which the dose-distribution computed tomography images and dose-volume histograms were calculated by defining the breast, axillary region (levels I, II, and III), lung, and heart region. Results Dose-volume histogram analysis demonstrated that breast tissue was radiated with an 86.5-100% volume (median 96.5%) by MTIT and an 83-100% volume (median, 95%) by CTIT at >95% of the isocenter dose. The axillary lymph node regions at Levels I, II, and III were irradiated with 84-100% (median, 94.5%), 59-100% (median, 89%), and 70-100% (median, 89.5%) volumes, respectively, by MTIT and with 2-84% (median, 38%), 0-53% (median, 15%), and 0-31% (median, 0%) volumes, respectively, by CTIT at >70% of the isocenter dose. The ipsilateral lung was irradiated with a 5-22% volume (median, 11.5%) by MTIT and 5-15% volume (median 9%) by CTIT at >90% of the isocenter dose. In all 25 left-sided breast cancer patients, the volumes irradiated with an 80% isocenter dose were <30 cm<sup>3</sup>. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrated that the breast tissue was sufficiently irradiated with both CTIT and MTIT planning, the axillary lymph node areas irradiated by MTIT were much wider than those irradiated by CTIT at all levels, and the lung and heart volumes irradiated by MTIT were small. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4261,"Benefits of dual energy CT imaging for differentiating contrast staining versus haemorrhage in post thrombectomy patients. Background: Due to the increase in Neurological Thrombectomy cases, we reviewed our 24 hour post procedural unenhanced CT head scan implemented to look for haemorrhagic transformation within the infarct. High attenuation signal can frequently be seen on unenhanced CT scan in these patients within the core infarct and is impossible to differentiate between iodine staining or haemorrhagic transformation. Evaluation of these images has always been subjective with no true diagnosis. Dual Energy CT is an established imaging modality in differentiation of iodine and haemorrhage in high density lesions, post clot retrieval or after contrast administration. Dual energy CT involves acquiring two simultaneous attenuation datasets at a high and low kV. The ratio of the difference in Hounsfield units in these two datasets gives us the ability to accurately differentiate different tissues. Utilising three material decomposition and iodine maps, virtual non-contrast images are created on the Syngo VIA workstation Case studies: A Siemens Dual Source CT scanner was utilised to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and/or haemorrhagic transformation in the case study patients that underwent clot retrieval. This is a robust method of differentiating between haemorrhage and/or iodine staining. Conclusion(s): The ability to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and haemorrhage in post thrombectomy patients in a single scan has numerous benefits. The treating team can adapt anticoagulant therapy with confidence, nursing time spent doing regular observations is greatly reduced if no haemorrhage is identified, patients can be expedited to rehabilitation wards, and radiation dose from repeat scans is eliminated.",Excluded

DNA samples were isolated from whole 5-6-days adult males. The aliquots of DNA were digested by S1-nuclease. Preimaginal stage lethality increased with irradiation dose increasing. At the same time, decrease in imaginal LS (life span) was observed after irradiation with the greatest dose (4 Gy) only. Moreover, hormesis by LS has revealed: in males irradiation with 0.25, 0.75 and 1 Gy increased the mean LS, and with 0.25 and 0.5 Gy caused the maximum LS; in females exposures with 0.25, 0.75 and 2 Gy increased the maximum LS. The densitometric assay of DNA electrophoregrams showed decrease by 39.2% of the part of high-molecular-weight DNA in control as a result of S1-nuclease action. Samples of DNA from the irradiated flies were more stable to enzyme action. The higher stability of DNA originated from the irradiated flies could be the result of reparation system activation. Ultrastructural changes induced at the egg stage by irradiation at the dose of 0.75 Gy testify the increased transcriptional activity of the brain cells.",Included

Rats with brain dysplasia evoked by interruption of different stages of prenatal neurogenesis show characteristic variations in susceptibility to seizures depending on the neurochemical specificity of pharmacological agents used to evoke seizures. To verify a discrepancy between the data obtained using different pharmacological models, neurochemically neutral electroshocks were applied here. To produce brain dysplasia of different degrees, pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to a single 1.0. Gy dose of gamma rays on gestation days 13, 15, 17 or 19. From the postnatal day 60, their male offspring (E13s, E15s, E17s and E19s, respectively) were subjected to 21 daily electrical stimulations to evoke seizures. Profiles of tonic and clonic reactivity to electrical stimulation significantly differed from those observed following pilocarpine or kainic acid administration. E17s showed minimal intensity of tonic but maximal of clonic responses. On the contrary, very high tonic and low clonic reactivity was observed in E13s and E15s. Periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNHs) were observed exclusively in E15s and E17s. Generally, the size of PNHs was correlated positively with susceptibility to tonic seizures but negatively with susceptibility to clonic seizures. Analogous correlations with the size of the neocortex were opposite. E13s and E19s had brains devoid PNHs but showed high tonic seizure susceptibility similar to that in E15s. It can therefore be concluded that PNHs modified the type of seizure reactivity from tonic to clonic, depending of their size, but the presence of PNHs was not necessary for the development of seizure susceptibility itself. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

For stable-xenon computed tomography (CT), an X-ray examination for measurement of cerebral blood circulation in the brain, the radiation exposure of the patient was determined in order to estimate the risk of inducing cancer. Organ doses of brain, eyelenses, thyroid and gonads have been calculated using the measured air kerma free-in-air on the axis of rotation and organ-specific conversion factors calculated with the Monte Carlo method. Dose measurements with TLD-100 rods using a humanoid Alderson phantom were carried out for verification of the calculated organ doses. In the case of brain partially located in the region of primary radiation a mean organ dose of 39 mSv was calculated. The dose measurements showed dose equivalents between 6 and 68 mSv in different regions of the brain and consequently an inhomogeneous dose distribution. From an estimation of the radiation-induced risk using the effective dose of 1.6 mSv it follows that one additional fatal cancer per 12,500 stable-xenon CT examinations has to be expected. The organ doses of eyelenses and thyroid located in the region of scattered radiation are so low that biological effects are hardly to be expected. The calculated dose equivalents of 6.5 mSv and 0.5 mSv, respectively, are in good agreement with measurements. The organ dose of gonads amounted to less than 0.07 mSv.",Excluded

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized study.OBJECTIVE: To compare occupational radiation exposure to the surgeon, as well as the patient, during posterior lumbar spine instrumentation in 10 navigated cases (navigated) versus 11 cases using the freehand technique (non-navigated).SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The use of navigation increases the accuracy of posterior lumbar instrumentation.A further speculated benefit of navigation is the reduction of radiation exposure of the surgeon. However, this has so far not been evaluated in such comparative manner.METHODS: Radiation exposure to the surgeon was measured by digital dosimeters placed at the level of the eye, chest, and dominant forearm. Radiation exposure was measured from the time of positioning of the patient to the end of the procedure both for navigated (intraoperative 3-dimensional [3D] fluoroscopy-based) and non-navigated (2-dimensional fluoroscopy-guided) freehand posterior lumbar spine instrumentations. A 3D fluoroscopic scan was routinely performed at the end of the procedure for all patients.RESULTS: Patients were distributed evenly in the 2 groups in terms of sex, age, body mass index, and the number of operated levels. The accumulated radiation dose for the surgeon was significantly higher in the non-navigated group; up to 9.96 times. The radiation dose for the patient was higher with the freehand technique, 1884.8 cGy.cm (non-navigated) versus 887 cGy.cm (navigated), without reaching a statistically significant level.CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure to the surgeon during pedicle screw placement with the freehand technique is up to 9.96 times greater than with the use of navigation. In the latter group, the only radiation exposure comes from the preoperative-level control and positioning of the 3D C-arm before 3D fluoroscopic acquisition. Furthermore, neuronavigation also reduces the cumulative dose for the patient.Level of evidence: 2.",Excluded
4651,"Control of brain metastases from radioresistant tumors treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. Renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma are considered to be ""radioresistant"" tumor histologies. Brain metastases (BM) from these tumors are considered unlikely to be controlled using the relatively low doses used in whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Our objective was to analyze the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on local control and overall survival of BM from radioresistant primary tumors. We reviewed all patients who received Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) for BM at Columbia University Medical Center between January 2009 and April 2014. All patients were treated using the Gamma Knife Perfexion System. Dosimetric data was collected from treatment plans and metastases were categorized as radioresistant or not. Response was assessed by reviewing follow-up brain imaging studies and classified according to RECIST. Local control and median overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In total, 373 tumors were analyzed from 126 patients. Of these tumors, 49 (13.1 %) originated from radioresistant cancers. The overall local control rate in the radioresistant cohort was 89.8 and 90.1 % in the non-radioresistant cohort. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that radioresistance status of the primary tumor had no statistically significant effect on local control with hazard ratios of 1.0 (p = 1.0, 95 % CI 0.388-2.576) and 0.954 (p = 0.926, 95 % CI 0.349-2.603) respectively. Median overall survival for both radioresistant and non-radioresistant cohorts was 20.0 months, with a p value of 0.926. There was no significant difference in local control of BM from radioresistant and non-radioresistant primary tumors treated with GKRS. Both cohorts showed excellent response and local control, suggesting that SRS upfront or in addition to WBRT may be an appropriate strategy in the treatment of BM from radioresistant cancers. Median overall survival for both cohorts was equal, suggesting that improved local control may be associated with an improvement in long-term survival.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method used in medical applications such as brain mapping or as a therapeutic tool in neurological and psychiatric disorders because it can stimulate defined regions of the brain without anaesthesia.METHODS: The action of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on HL-60 and PC12 cells has been investigated. The cells have been stimulated in vitro with different number of pulses (75 - 1250), different intensities (10, 20 and 40%) and different frequencies (0.25, 1 and 10 Hz) by using a double coil (2x70 mm) connected to the 'Magstim rapid'. At selected time points after treatment the following endpoints have been determined: viability, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) (HL-60 cells), and viability, cAMP, dopamine and noradrenaline (PC12 cells). Viability was measured with the alamarBlue assay, whereas cAMP, Hsp72, dopamine and noradrenaline were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).RESULTS: In both cell lines viability was not influenced by rTMS treatment, the same was true for the cytosolic cAMP concentration. In HL-60 cells rTMS treatment did not change the Hsp72 content, also a protective effect of rTMS treatment on cell viability before toxic H(2)O(2) treatment was not observed. After high potassium treatment the release of the two neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline in PC12 cells was enhanced 15- and 5-fold, respectively, but after rTMS treatment no change in the release of the two neurotransmitters was observed.CONCLUSIONS: In two mammalian cell lines rTMS treatment in a variety of exposure conditions does not influence any of the measured parameters.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To investigate (i) the effect of monochromatic light on inhibiting induction of light-induced melatonin and (ii) the roles of melanopsin and MT1 receptor in light-induced myopia in the guinea pig.METHODS: Forty-eight guinea pigs were randomly distributed into three treatment groups: white-light (control), green-light (530 nm), and blue-light (480 nm) groups. Levels of pineal gland melatonin were measured twice daily--10:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.--10 days after initial light treatment. Thirty additional guinea pigs were also assigned to these groups and treated similarly. For these latter animals, refractive status, ocular length, and vitreous depth were measured before and after light treatment. Eight weeks after light treatment, retinal and sceral levels of melanopsin, melatonin receptor type (MT) 1, and mRNA protein were determined by Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: The level of pineal gland melatonin in the green-light group was significantly higher than that in the blue-light group. Biometric measurements showed that guinea pigs in the green-light group had a somewhat myopic refractive status. Expressions of retinal melanopsin mRNA and protein were significantly higher in the blue-light group and lower in the green-light group when compared to controls. Conversely, expressions of MT1 receptor mRNA and protein in retina and sclera were significantly higher in the green-light group and lower in the blue-light group when compared to controls.CONCLUSIONS: Green light appears to suppress induction of melatonin production.

Female albino C57 (8-10 weeks old, Jackson Laboratories) animals underwent +DsRed bone marrow transplant (B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-DsRed*MST)1Nagy/J donor mouse). Following engraftment, glioma cells were cranially implanted with 1x10 glioma cells (GL261-Luc, Perkin Elmer), at an average size of 26.4mm indicated by a bioluminescence signal of 5.28x10 photons/sec/cm/sr, animals underwent 6Gy (RadSource 2000, 250kVp, 25mA) of irradiation limited to a 1cm wide slit centered on the tumor. Bioluminescence (tumor size) and fluorescence imaging (+DsRed BMDCs) was performed prior to and at 1-and 2-weeks post-RT to assess tumor growth and measure the influx of +DsRed BMDCs. In addition, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the tumor and brain. To study the effect of BMDCs in tumor regression, tumors were irradiated at a smaller size (9.3mm) with 10Gy irradiation. At 1-week post-RT, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of BMDCs (CD45+) in the tumor. In our model 6Gy radiation was able to stall the growth of the tumor. Irradiated tumors did not significantly change in tumor size at either 1-or 2-weeks post irradiation compared to pre-RT size. In addition, irradiated tumors were significantly smaller than untreated tumors (p=0.0008) 1-week post-RT. Using flow cytometry 1-week post irradiation, we observed a significant increase in the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the irradiated tumor (23.5% of cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the irradiated brain (6.17% cells +DsRed BMDCs, p=0.03) as well as a significant increase in the tumors (16.6% cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the brain (11.1% cells +DsRed BMDCs p=0.02). There was no difference in the number of +DsRed BMDCS in tumors +/- irradiation or brains +/- irradiation. We found similar results in our tumor regression model using flow cytometry 1-week post-RT; we observed an increase in the number of BMDCs CD45+ in the tumor (~20% of cells CD45+) compared to control tumors (~6% of cells CD45+). Indicating that tumor size at the onset of RT did not effect the migration of BMDCs. Fluorescence imaging did not measure any significant change in the DsRed signal at 1-or 2-weeks post-irradiation. We have successfully shown that post-RT there is an increase in BMDCs migration at 1-week post RT regardless of tumor size at RT. Further experimentation is needed to better elucidate the role of BMDCs in tumor inflammation and immune suppression as well as angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Our next step is to perform immunohistochemistry on our collected tumor tissue to map out the spatial location of migrated BMDCs within the tumor.",Excluded
4372,"Sequelae in long-term survivors of small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Central nervous system (CNS) effects of chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) are studied in long-term small cell lung cancer (SCLC) survivors. The exact significance and pathogenesis of the neurotoxicity is still unknown, as studies on this subject lack sufficient patient numbers and are performed in an extremely varied manner.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-nine survivors (> 2 years from diagnosis) were examined neurologically and neuropsychologically, and underwent a cranial computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance (MR). Eight patients were excluded from further analysis for various reasons (not SCLC-related CNS disease, n = 6; no chemotherapy nor PCI treatment, n = 2). The remaining 51 patients were divided into three groups; group 1 = chemotherapy alone (n = 21), group 2 = sequential PCI (n = 19), and group 3 = concurrent or sandwiched PCI (n = 11). Groups were neuropsychologically compared in matched controls.RESULTS: Performance status did not differ significantly between various treatment groups; all patients remained ambulatory and capable of self-care. Mental impairment (n = 20), motor abnormalities (n = 9), and visual complaints (n = 1), were found in five patients in group 1 (24%), eight patients in group 2 (42%), and eight patients in group 3 (73%). Analysis of brain atrophy revealed no significant results; however, white matter abnormalities were found more frequently in group 3. Neuropsychologically no significant group differences existed, although interference sensitivity and difficulties with divided attention tended to occur more frequently in patients treated with PCI. Mean neuropsychometric results of treatment groups were significantly worse than those of matched controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although more intensively treated patients showed more neurologic impairment and patients in group 3 had more white matter abnormalities, there was no statistic evidence for additional neurotoxicity of PCI. Marked neuropsychometric differences between patients and matched controls may indicate that cognitive impairment is partly disease related, probably due to emotional distress and deteriorated physical condition.",Excluded
3762,"Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors: The Impact of Treatment on Patient Outcome. Primary central nervous system (CNS) germinoma is readily curable with relatively large volume/high dose radiotherapy but the late effects of treatment may alter neurocognitive functioning and quality of life. Prior studies have associated radiation therapy with deficits in the domains of intelligence, attention, memory, and psychomotor processing speed, with risk factors including young age at irradiation and increased irradiation volume and dosage level. Furthermore, cranial irradiation may also lead to diminished height, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and hearing loss. Few germ cell tumor follow-up studies have adequately examined the late effects of therapy, with results varying between lowered physical quality of life without significant cognitive sequelae to significant correlations between young age at treatment and lowered levels of intellectual functioning and quality of life. Consequently, further investigation is warranted that includes baseline and biannual psychological assessments that focus beyond a singular measure of intelligence and provide data on a range of domains such as attention-concentration, memory and executive functioning, as well as quality of life, social-emotional and behavioral functioning. Since systemic and CNS germ cell tumors are highly sensitive to chemotherapy as well as to radiotherapy, future studies should examine whether the addition of chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy will permit response-based reductions in radiotherapy fields and allow the administration of doses that will translate into meaningful improvements in functional outcome with preservation of excellent long-term disease control.",Excluded

Objective: To investigate the impact of a neutron beam formed with the accelerator-based epithermal neutron source designed at the G.I. Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) on the viability of human and animal tumor cells cultured in the presence of boron-10 isotope.Material and Methods: Human U251 and T98G glioma cells and Chinese hamster CHO-K1 and V-79 cells were incubated at various concentrations in the culture medium containing 10B-enriched L-boronophenylalanine. The cells were irradiated with a neuron beam using the accelerator-based epithermal neuron source. A clonogenic assay was used to evaluate the viability of the irradiated cells. The absorbed doses obtained from elastic scattering of fast neutrons by substance nuclei and the doses obtained from boron neutron capture were calculated using the NMS code. The absorbed doses of gamma-radiation were measured with a mixed radiation dosimeter.Results: The viability of boron-containing and intact human U251 and T98G cell lines and Chinese hamster CHO-K1 and V-79 cells was analyzed after neutron beam radiation. Irradiation of all four cell lines were cultured in the presence of 10B was shown to reduce their colony-forming capacity compared with the control. Elevated boron levels in the culture medium resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of survived cells. Radiation had the most pronounced impact on the proliferative capacity of the human U251 glioma cell lines.Conclusion: The cultures of human tumor cells and mammalian cells demonstrated that the neutron beam formed with the accelerator-based epithermal neutron source designed at the INP, was effective in reducing the viability of tumor cells in the presence of 10B.",Excluded
4050,"Local diagnostic reference levels and size-specific patient dose in computed tomography at a Greek Hospital. Purpose: Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) are a useful tool for patient dose optimization, however, they do not consider patient size as the concept of the sizespecific dose estimate (SSDE) introduced by AAPM. The aim of this study is to extract local DRLs for computed tomography (CT) exams at a Greek University Hospital in terms of volumetric CT Dose Index (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP), as well as to evaluate the impact of patient size in patients' dose through SSDE. Method(s): The retrospective data from a total of 164 CT studies of Abdomen-Pelvis (A-P), Brain, Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis (C-A-P), Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) and Heart were extracted from a 16-slice and a 64-slice CT scanner and were utilized to extract DLP and CTDI values. This study estimated the effective dose (ED) from DLP measurements using the appropriate k-factors. SSDE was calculated from the product of CTDIvol with the appropriate conversion factor, based on the sum of the lateral and anteroposterior diameters. Results are compared with international DRL data. Result(s): Compared to national DRLs, the local DRLs regarding the CTDIvol values were lower by 14% for Abdomen-Pelvis, 43% for Brain and 25% for Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis exams. For CTPA and heart exams national DRLs were not suggested. In comparison to international DRLs, the picture of our results is mixed, having both higher and lower DRLs than other countries. However, for the CTPA exams, the local DRLs were higher by a range of 13%-30%. SSDE mean values were higher than CTDIvol mean values by a range of 19%- 24%, nonetheless for the brain exams their mean values were the same. Conclusion(s): The metrics of CTDIvol, DLP and ED were useful to evaluate our institution's radiology practice regarding the radiation exposure. Since SSDE is a more accurate patient dose indicator, it would be advantageous to be established as a DRL.",Excluded

4642,"Lack of the alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 causes tremors, seizures, and early postnatal death in mice. The Na(+)-independent alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 (Asc-1) is exclusively expressed in neuronal structures throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Asc-1 transports small neutral amino acids with high affinity especially for D-serine and glycine (K(i): 8-12 microM), two endogenous glutamate co-agonists that activate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors through interacting with the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding-site. By regulating D-serine (and possibly glycine) levels in the synaptic cleft, Asc-1 may play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. We generated asc-1 gene knockout (asc-1(-/-)) mice to test this hypothesis. Behavioral phenotyping combined with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings revealed that asc-1(-/-) mice developed tremors, ataxia, and seizures that resulted in early postnatal death. Both tremors and seizures were reduced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Extracellular recordings from asc-1(-/-) brain slices indicated that the spontaneous seizure activity did not originate in the hippocampus, although, in this region, a relative increase in evoked synaptic responses was observed under nominal Mg(2+)-free conditions. Taken together with the known neurochemistry and neuronal distribution of the Asc-1 transporter, these results indicate that the mechanism underlying the behavioral hyperexcitability in mutant mice is likely due to overactivation of NMDA receptors, presumably resulting from elevated extracellular D-serine. Our study provides the first evidence to support the notion that Asc-1 transporter plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability, and indicate that the transporter is vital for normal CNS function and essential to postnatal survival of mice.",Excluded

Twenty-seven advanced ovarian carcinoma patients who had received six courses of cyclophosphamide/cisplatin and had either microscopic disease (15 patients) or no pathologically detectable disease (12 patients) after second-look laparotomy were treated with abdominopelvic radiation (2250 cGy to the abdomen and pelvis and a 2250-cGy pelvic boost). Acute myelosuppression or gastrointestinal toxicity prevented completion of treatment in only three patients. However, bowel obstruction occurred in 13 (48%), ten of whom required surgery. Five of these ten had recurrent tumor, but the other five did not. Subsequently two of the latter five did develop a recurrence, one in the lung and one in the liver. A third patient died as an indirect result of radiation damage to the bowel. Median follow-up duration is 17 months from completion of radiation. So far, 13 (48%) have developed progressive disease: four (33%) of the 12 who had a negative second-look laparotomy and nine (60%) of the 15 who had microscopic disease before radiation. While acute toxicity is tolerable, the incidence of serious chronic bowel toxicity is high.

3841,"Missense mutations but not allelic variants alter the function of ATM by dominant interference in patients with breast cancer. The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and an elevated risk of malignancy. Epidemiological data support an increased risk for breast and other cancers in A-T heterozygotes. However, screening breast cancer cases for truncating mutations in the ATM (A-T mutated) gene has failed largely to reveal an increased incidence in these patients. It has been hypothesized that ATM missense mutations are implicated in breast cancer, and there is some evidence to support this. The presence of a large variety of rare missense variants in addition to common polymorphisms in ATM makes it difficult to establish such a relationship by association studies. To investigate the functional significance of these changes we have introduced missense substitutions, identified in either A-T or breast cancer patients, into ATM cDNA before establishing stable cell lines to determine their effect on ATM function. Pathogenic missense mutations and neutral missense variants were distinguished initially by their capacity to correct the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells. Furthermore missense mutations abolished the radiation-induced kinase activity of ATM in normal control cells, caused chromosome instability, and reduced cell viability in irradiated control cells, whereas neutral variants failed to do so. Mutant ATM was expressed at the same level as endogenous protein, and interference with normal ATM function seemed to be by multimerization. This approach represents a means of identifying genuine ATM mutations and addressing the significance of missense changes in the ATM gene in a variety of cancers including breast cancer.",Excluded
4522,"Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as a protective effect of nicaraven in ionizing radiation- and ara-C-induced cell death. BACKGROUND: Nicaraven is a drug used for patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and has potent antivasospastic and brain-protective effects. While nicaraven scavenges the hydroxyl radical, the mechanism of its protection remains obscure. In addition to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, nicaraven also exhibits inhibitory action on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The mechanism of the pharmacological action of nicaraven has not yet been clarified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid HL-525 cells were exposed to ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide and the effect of nicaraven on the activation of the Egr-1 promoter was measured. Next, the action of the drug on DNA fragmentation and inhibition of thymidine uptake caused by the genotoxic stimulation of ionizing radiation or cytosine B-D-arabinofuranoside (ara-C) were assessed. Finally, direct inhibition of the PARP enzyme by nicaraven was measured.RESULTS: Nicaraven did not inhibit the activation of the Egr-1 promoter caused by H2O2 and the activation caused by ionizing radiation. However, the drug repressed DNA fragmentation and increased thymidine uptake dose-dependently. Nicaraven had a direct inhibitory effect on PARP.DISCUSSION: The effect of nicaraven on the Egr-1 promoter was different from that of another free-radical scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine. Nicaraven demonstrated similar protection of the PARP inhibitors including 3-aminobenzamide. Since nicaraven directly inhibits the PARP enzyme, the drug might be useful in oncology as well as in studying tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased PARP activity.",Excluded

3720,"Prevalence of abnormal brain CT scan finding in patients with headache: Two year study in Imam Hospital. [Arabic]. Background: Headache is one of the most common problems that bring patients to doctors' offices. Many physicians order neuroimaging studies after taking the history of the patient and performing a physical examination. These neuroimaging studies are often requested due to the probable existence of an intracranial lesion. However, at times they are requested to allay the fears of patients or even doctors. Most of these studies are normal and the question arises whether there is any indication for requesting neuroimaging studies for a patient with an isolated headache. Method(s): We studied 146 patients with headache who had been referred for CT scan to the imaging center of Imam Khomeini Hospital during 2004-2005. For each patient, a questionnaire, including the medical history and accompanying neurological symptoms, was filled out and CT scan results were gathered. Result(s): The mean of age of the patients was 37.8 years, and 69% were female. Only 10 patients (6.8%) had a brain lesion in the CT scan. Accompanying neurological symptoms were more frequent in patients with abnormal rather than normal CT scans. There was a meaningful correlation between abnormal CT scan and paresthesia, ptosis, paresia, diplopia, visual loss, convulsion, vomiting and vertigo. A statistical correlation existed between gender and positive CT scan. Conclusion(s): Many patients with headache have normal brain CT scan results.

INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor with a short expected median survival, despite current standard-of-care treatment. We explored the combination of intermediate stereotactic dose radiation therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy as a novel treatment strategy for GBM.METHODS: Glioma xenograft-bearing mice were exposed to high dose brain-directed radiation (10 Gy single exposure) as well as mouse anti-PD-1 antibody. The tumor-bearing animals were randomized to four groups: no treatment, radiation alone, anti-PD-1 alone, and radiation + anti-PD-1. Survival was followed, and tumor growth was monitored using MRI. Immunohistochemistry, gene expression arrays, and flow cytometry were used to characterize the treatment-induced effects. Pharmacologic inhibitors of T-lymphocytes, bone marrow derived macrophages, and microglia were used to assess the respective roles of different immune populations in observed treatment effects.RESULTS: We found the combined treatment with high dose radiation and immunotherapy to be highly effective with a 75% complete pathologic response and dramatically improved survival outcomes. We found both CD8+ T-cells and macrophages to be necessary for the full effect of combined therapy, with T lymphocytes appearing to play a role early on and macrophages mediating a later phase of the combined treatment effect. Radiation treatment appeared to trigger macrophage repolarization, increasing M1/M2 ratio.CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to a novel immunologic mechanism underlying the interaction between radiotherapy and immunotherapy. They also provide the basis for clinical investigation of immunogenic dose radiation in combination with immune checkpoint blockade as a potential treatment approach for newly diagnosed high grade gliomas.",Excluded
3805,"Electric field stimulation of precision-cut lung slices. The precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) technique is widely used to examine airway responses in different species. We developed a method to study nerve-dependent bronchoconstriction by the application of electric field stimulation (EFS) to PCLS. PCLS prepared from Wistar rats were placed between two platinum electrodes to apply serial rectangular impulses (5-100 Hz), and bronchoconstriction was studied by videomicroscopy. The extent of airway contractions increased with higher frequencies. Stable repeated airway contractions were obtained at a frequency of 50 Hz, a width of 1 ms, and an output of 200 mA for 2.5 s each minute. Larger airways showed stronger responses. The EFS-triggered contractions were increased by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor neostigmine (10 muM) and reversed by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 muM), whereas the thromboxane protanoid receptor antagonist SQ29548 (10 muM) had no effect. Magnesium ions (10 mM) antagonized airway contractions induced by EFS, but not by methacholine, indicating that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS. Our data further show that the electrically evoked airway contractions in PCLS are mediated by cholinergic nerves, independent of thromboxane and more prominent in larger airways. Taken together these findings show that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS, and they suggest that the present method is useful to study neurogenic responses in airways of different size.

This paper investigates an event-triggered neuroadaptive control approach for postcapture flexible spacecraft with guaranteed prespecified tracking performance in the presence of unknown inertial properties, actuator constraints, and external space perturbations. By employing the minimum-learning parameter technique into the neural proportional integral-like controller, only two adaptive parameters are required to update online, which completely avoids the tedious inertial parameter identifications and dramatically reduces the complexity of controller in the meanwhile. Compared with existing works, the primary advantage of the proposed attitude control approach is that the actuator updates are determined by the prescribed event-based conditions in an aperiodic way rather than a periodic one, which greatly reduces the actuator updates. Finally, two groups of illustrative examples are organized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of attitude stabilization and tracking for the postcapture flexible spacecraft.

Method(s): As all patients admitted for suspicion of SD receive imaging studies, we searched for adult patients receiving neuroimaging in the period from January 2010 to July 2013, analysing referring diagnosis, clinical signs, products, diagnostic process and final diagnosis. Recursive partitioning was used to define time intervals for differentiating types of SD. Result(s): A total of 148 patients, aged 18-89 (mean, 54) years, were studied. Forty-two percent were referred by a hospital or rehabilitation centre, 30% by general practitioners and 24% were self-referrals. The admission diagnosis was in the majority ""shunt dysfunction"" only. Further differentiations were rarely made. An SD was confirmed in 46% of the patients. In 17%, the symptoms were based on another cause and in 37% they could not be clearly attributed to any specific disorder. Abdominal dislocations (2%) and shunt infections (5%) were found within the first 6 months. Over- (3%) and under-drainage (14%) were the most frequent complications during the first 4 years.

3702,"Dual role of MRK in glioblastoma invasion and radio-resistance. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, has poor prognosis both because of diffuse infiltration of tumor cells in the normal parenchyma and resistance to radiation treatment and chemotherapy. We found that MRK, a stress-activated MAP3K protein kinase, is overexpressed in GBM compared with normal brain tissue, evident in microarray expression data and confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. We have shown that MRK can be activated by at least two distinct signaling inputs: MRK kinase activity is stimulated by ionizing radiation (IR) downstream of NBS1 and ATM in a pathway that leads to activation of Chk2 and cell-cycle arrest. We also showed that downregulation of MRK by RNA interference sensitizes SNB19 and U87 GBM cells to IR. In addition, MRK functions as an effector of RhoC in a pathway that is initiated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a motogenic factor that is overproduced in GBM tumors. We also showed that MRK depletion impairs LPA-stimulated invasion in GBM cells. To examine the role of MRK in GBM in vivo, we used an orthotopic xenograft model. Human GBM explant cells (GBM6) were maintained in nude mice as flank tumors, transduced in vitro with lentiviruses expressing control or MRK shRNA, and subsequently implanted into the brains of nude mice. Control mice had a median survival of 47 days, whereas downregulation of MRK increased survival by 14 days. In a parallel experiment, mice were treated with 20-Gy radiation in 10 fractions over 5 days. This radiation treatment on its own increased survival by only 7 days; in contrast, downregulation of MRK had a strongly synergistic effect, extending survival by more than 35 days.

Specific chromosomal changes in some A-T patients appear to be associated with cancer induction, and it is suggested that these could be linked to a DNA repair-fidelity defect. However, a general correlation between radiosensitivity and cancer-proneness is difficult to establish at present, partly because of diversity in radiosensitivity in the normal population.

Despite the widespread use of radiotherapy to treat painful bone metastases, the mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of low dose ionizing radiation is unknown. Bone cancer pain is mostly associated with an inflammatory response dominated by local activation of osteoclasts and by astrogliosis in the spinal cord. We determined the effects of a 6 Gy irradiation given focally on osteolytic sarcoma cells inoculated in humeri of mice. Pain behavior was assessed using the rota-rod and the grip force test. Seven days post-irradiation (day 17 post-tumor implantation) the performance of mice markedly improved on the rotarod (non-irradiated, 67+/-16s vs irradiated, 223 +/- 22 s; P = 0.0005), and the grip force test (non-irradiated, 34 +/- 4 g vs irradiated, 55 +/- 2 g; P = 0.001). This improvement was similar to the analgesia achieved with 30 mg/kg of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ketorolac (Rota-rod, 67 +/- 16 s vs 178 +/- 35 s; P = 0.01: grip force test, 34 +/- 4 g, vs 60 +/- 5 g; P = 0.003). Following irradiation, the tumor mass and the number of osteoclasts did not decrease while the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) increased. Tumor irradiation led to clear differences in the spinal cord. These include a decrease in glial activity (astrocytes and microglial cells) as well as pain mediators such as dynorphin, COX-2 and chemotactic cytokine receptor (CCR2). We conclude that the analgesic effect of low dose irradiation of bone cancer is associated with the alteration of nociceptive transmission in the central nervous system.",Excluded

At 1 month after applying the 10 and 30 Gy of radiation, MBP mRNA expression showed a transient but significant decrease, followed by recovery to baseline levels at 3 months after treatment. The MBP levels were decreased by only 70-75% at 1 month after 10 and 30 Gy of radiation. At 2-3 months after applying the higher dose of 30 Gy, however, the MBP levels continued to decline, and typical demyelination changes were observed with myelin staining and ultrastructural examination. Conclusions. The authors' results suggest that the early radiation-induced MBP changes between 1 and 3 months af ter single treatments of 10 and 30 Gy of radiation to the whole brain are indicative of permanent injury shown as de myelination of irradiated brain tissue.",Included

Effects of gamma-radiation at a dose of 3 Gy against either antiorthostatic hypodynamia (AOH) or hypokinesia (HK) on formation of the differentiated motor-drinking reflex (DR) were compared. Each of the forms of motor deprivation hindered the elaboration of DR; gamma-irradiation aggravated these disorders. At the same time, AOH led to significantly more severe disturbances in the higher nervous activity including the generalized excitation, pathologic aggressiveness and neurotization of animals. In contrast, hypokinesia stimulated the active elements of behavior which inhibit the passive-defensive behavior and a fear reaction. Therefore, the modifying effect of irradiation becomes apparent only if combined with AOH.",Included

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can develop into hematopoietic and mesenchymal lineages but have not been known to participate in the production of retina. Here we report that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, after being subretinally transplanted into normal or Nd: YAG laser-injured rat eye, can integrate into RPE layer, photoreceptor layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion layer. DAPI-labeling detection was used to trace the origin of the repopulating cells. DAPI fluorescence was used to identify retina cells of bone marrow origin 10, 20, 35 and 50 days after transplantation. No formation of rosettes was found but some random cells were found at the end of the observation. MSCs-originated cells spread more widely in the injured retinas than in the normal ones. Immunohistochemical detection showed that though the cells could express neuronal nuclei (NeuN), neuron specific enolase (NSE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cytokeratin (CK), the proteins expression in the injured transplantation group was abnormal in some region compared with that in the normal transplantation group. Electroretinogram (ERG) showed that ERG-b wave of the injured transplantation group is significantly higher than that of the two laser-injured control groups. These results suggest that a proportion of MSCs can differentiate into retina-like structure in vivo and the differentiation differs in normal and laser-injured retinas.",Excluded
4589,"Measuring smoking-induced extrastriatal dopamine release: A [11C]FLB-457 pet study. Background: Preclinical studies indicate that nicotine can induce dopamine (DA) release in striatal and cortical brain regions, contributing to the reinforcing and cognitive effects respectively. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies using the D2/3 radiotracer [11C] raclopride to indirectly measure DA release via receptor occupancy have confirmed that tobacco smoking releases DA in striatal regions in humans. However, due to the low density of DA receptors in the cortex it was not possible to measure extrastriatal DA release in humans until the recent development of high affinity D2/3 radiotracers. In this study we used the high affinity D2/3 radiotracer [11C]FLB-457 to index tobacco-induced extrastriatal DA release in smokers. Method(s): Ten nicotine-dependent daily cigarette smokers underwent two high affinity [11C]FLB-457 PET scans: after overnight abstinence and smoking reinstatement (biochemically verified by expired carbon monoxide and plasma nicotine levels). Craving, withdrawal, mood and cognitive performance were assessed under both smoking conditions. Voxel-wise parameter estimation of binding potential (BPND) was performed using the basis function implementation of SRTM with the tissue time activity curve of the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Spatially normalized [11C]FLB-457 BPND maps were statistically investigated to assess significant changes between the two conditions at every voxel using paired-tests (SPM 8). Results from the whole-brain voxel-wise paired t-test (abstinence 4 smoking) were masked with a map of a-priori regions of interest and subjected to an uncorrected threshold of p<0.05, with a minimum 30-voxel cluster extent. Result(s): There was a reduction [11C]FLB-457 BPND following smoking (an indirect measure of DA release) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 323 voxels, peak t=3.38, p=0.004), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex/ anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC / ACC; 1496 voxels, peak t=5.32, p<0.001), both of which survived a more stringent threshold of p<0.01, and the left insula (47 voxels, peak t=2.54 p=0.016). Exploratory analysis focused on limbic regions identified an effect in the bilateral amygdala (Left: 102 voxels, peak t=3.28, p=0.005; Right: 108 voxels, peak t =3.03, p=0.007). Extraction of values from these clusters revealed % changes in BPND in smoking versus abstinence conditions of -12.0% (SD=9.4) in the dlPFC, -11.5% (SD=12.8) in the dmPFC/ACC, -7.1% (SD=7.9) in the left insula and -13.1% in the bilateral amygdala. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of smoking-induced DA release in cortical regions such as the dlPFC, dmPFC and ACC. There was also some evidence for DA release in the insula and amygdala. The dmPFC, ACC, insula and amygdala are regions consistently associated with tobacco cue-presentaton, subjective craving and relapse susceptibility in fMRI studies, while the dlPFC appears to exert top-down control on tobacco craving and is involved in tobacco's pro-cognitive effects.

It may improve the diagnostic confidence of dating, nuchal translucency (NT) and chorionicity assignment in twin pregnancies. The ""virtual 3DUS placentoscopy"" can guide selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (SFLP) to treat twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Volumetric assessment of the dysmorphic acardiac twin with the Virtual Organ Computer-aided Analysis (VOCAL) software is more accurate than the conventional ultrasound measurement. Twin anemia polycythemia (TAP) sequence and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) may be clinically monitored with 3DUS placental volume (PV) and power Doppler vascular indices. Congenital anomalies are more common in twins. Evaluation of fetal anomalies with 3DUS could assist perinatal management. The 3DUS power Doppler can provide a better understanding of true and false umbilical cord knots, which are commonly found in monoamniotic (MA) twins. Single demise in monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies can cause severe neurologic morbidity in the surviving co-twin. Prenatal prediction of brain injury in the surviving co-twin with unremarkable neurosonographic examination is difficult. The 3DUS power Doppler may aid in prenatal detection of subtle abnormal cerebral perfusion. Prenatal assessment of conjoined twins with 3DUS is important if emergency postnatal surgical separation is anticipated. There is no significant additional advantage in using real-time 3DUS to guide prenatal interventions. Assessment of the cervix and pelvic floor during twin pregnancies is enhanced with 3DUS. Due to lack of high-quality studies, routine prenatal 3DUS in twin pregnancies needs to be balanced with risks of excessive ultrasound exposure.

4516,"Challenges and practicalities in the clinical implementation of Lutetium 177 for therapeutic nuclear medicine: A technologist's perspective. Objectives: FDA approval of Lutetium177 (Lu177) treatment of neuroendocrine tumor is pending. Lu177 therapy is logistically different than any other currently used radionuclide therapeutic agent. We aim to present a technologist's perspective on potential challenges related to the implementation of Lu177 therapy including developing an institution's policy, identifying needed location/space, supplies, and staff requirements. Method(s): A Lu177 treatment regimen consists of 4 intravenous infusions of 200 mCi at 8 week intervals. Each therapeutic infusion is 4-6 hours, consists of the Lu177 infusion along with an infusion of amino acids and requires nursing supervision. During this process, to reduce radiation exposure, the patient must walk to the restroom every thirty minutes with an IV pole to void. The technologists met with the Authorized Users (AU), the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), and the other staff involved to review the requirements of radiation safety, workflow, and protocol of this therapy. Result(s): The radioactive materials license is to be amended. It was determined that Lu177 administration would ideally occur in our PET division due to department layout and patient flow. While the general nuclear medicine department has an injection room suited for therapeutic use, the restroom is not in close proximity, which is a radiation safety concern. In our PET center, there are 2 comfortable injection rooms used for long uptake periods located next to a restroom dedicated for radioactive patients. Due to the stated length of the Lu177 therapy session, the PET diagnostic schedule will be reduced on Lu177 therapy days. Lu177 therapies will be scheduled in coordination with other departments including oncology; pharmacy for obtaining amino acids; and nursing for the administration of IV fluids and vital sign monitoring. After the infusion is completed and the injection room is cleaned, radioactive waste will be moved to long term storage. Conclusion(s): Lu177 therapy is an exciting new development in the field of radionuclide therapy: however, its implementation brings new challenges to meet both radiation safety and protocol requirements. Space, workflow, and staffing must all be considered. Lu177 therapies will involve the coordination of AUs, the RSO, technologists, nursing staff, pharmacist, and logistics personnel.

4145,"Irradiation and hypoxia promote homing of haematopoietic progenitor cells towards gliomas by TGF-beta-dependent HIF-1alpha-mediated induction of CXCL12. Previously we defined a pathway of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXC chemokine ligand 12 (SDF-1alpha/CXCL12) dependent migration of adult haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPC) towards glioma cells in vitro and their homing to experimental gliomas in vivo. Hypoxia is a critical aspect of the microenvironment of gliomas and irradiation is an essential part of the standard therapy. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of HPC as vectors for a cell-based therapy of gliomas, we investigated the impact of hypoxia and irradiation on the attraction of HPC by glioma cells. Temozolomide (TMZ) treatment and hyperthermia served as controls. Supernatants of irradiated or hypoxic LNT-229 glioma cells promote HPC migration in vitro. Reporter assays reveal that the CXCL12 promoter activity is enhanced in LNT-229 cells at 24 h after irradiation at 8 Gy or after exposure to 1% oxygen for 12 h. The irradiation- and hypoxia-induced release of CXCL12 depends on hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), but not on p53. Induction of transcriptional activity of HIF-1alpha by hypoxia or irradiation requires an intact TGF-beta signalling cascade. This delineates a novel stress signalling cascade in glioma cells involving TGF-beta, HIF-1alpha and CXCL12. Stress stimuli can be irradiation, hypoxia or TMZ, but not hyperthermia. Cerebral irradiation of nude mice at 21 days after intracerebral implantation of LNT-229 glioma induces tumour satellite formation and enhances the glioma tropism of HPC to the tumour bulk and even to these satellites in vivo. These data suggest that the use of HPC as cellular vectors in the treatment of glioblastoma may well be combined with irradiation or other anti-angiogenic therapies that induce tumour hypoxia.",Excluded
4784,"Surface-Based Falff: A Potential Novel Biomarker for Prediction of Radiation Encephalopathy in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. Radiation encephalopathy (RE) is an important potential complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who undergo radiotherapy (RT) that can affect the quality of life. However, a functional imaging biomarker of pre-symptomatic RE has not yet been established. This study aimed to assess radiation-induced gray matter functional alterations and explore fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) as an imaging biomarker for predicting or diagnosing RE in patients with NPC. A total of 60 patients with NPC were examined, 21 in the pre-RT cohort and 39 in the post-RT cohort. Patients in the post-RT cohort were further divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of RE in follow-up: post-RT <inf>non-RE</inf> (n = 21) and post-RT <inf>REproved</inf><inf>infollow-up</inf> (n = 18). Surface-based and volume-based fALFF were used to detect radiation-induced functional alterations. Functional derived features were then adopted to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of RE. We observed that surface-based fALFF could sensitively detect radiation-induced functional alterations in the intratemporal brain regions (such as the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus), as well as the extratemporal regions (such as the insula and prefrontal lobe); however, no significant intergroup differences were observed using volume-based fALFF. No significant correlation between fALFF and radiation dose to the ipsilateral temporal lobe was observed. Support vector machine (SVM) analysis revealed that surface-based fALFF in the bilateral superior temporal gyri and left insula exhibited impressive performance (accuracy = 80.49%) in identifying patients likely to develop RE. We conclude that surface-based fALFF may serve as a sensitive imaging biomarker in the prediction of RE. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Kang, Zeng, Li, Gao, Liu, Shi and Liao.",Included

4279,"A novel TNFRSF member, TROY (TNFRSF19), is upregulated in glioblastoma and mediates glioblastoma cell invasion and survival. Glioblastoma (GB) is the most malignant form of all primary adult brain tumors. Of the features that characterize GB, arguably none is more clinically significant than the propensity of glioma cells to aggressively invade the surrounding normal brain tissue. These invasive cells render complete resection impossible and confer resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. To improve treatment of malignant glioma, we must find a way to stop the dispersing tumor cells. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily and their cognate receptors regulate various cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. The TROY gene (TNFRSF19) encodes an orphan member of the TNFR superfamily: a type I cell-surface receptor that lacks a cytoplasmic death domain but contains a single TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-binding site. We demonstrate that TROY expression correlates inversely with patient survival and drives GB cell migration and invasion. Our results showed that TROY overexpression in glioma cells activated Rac1 signaling in a Pyk2-dependent manner to drive invasion and migration. Knockdown of TROY in a primary GB xenograft significantly prolonged survival in vivo. In addition, when we activated expression of TROY in mouse astrocytes in vivo using an RCAS vector system for glial-specific gene transfer in G-tva transgenic mice, astrocyte migration was induced within the brain, corroborating the in vitro importance of the TROY signaling cascade in GB invasion. TROY expression significantly increased resistance of GB cells to both IRand TMZ-induced apoptosis in vitro via the Akt and NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of either Akt or NF-kappaB activity suppressed the survival benefits of TROY signaling in response to TMZ treatment. These findings suggest that the aberrant expression and/or signaling by TROY contributes to, and possibly drives, the malignant dispersion of glioma cells.",Excluded

Background: Brain irradiation (BI) in humans may cause behavioral changes, cognitive impairment and neuroendocrine dysfunction. The effect of BI on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is not fully understood. Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of BI on HPA axis responses under basal and stressful conditions as well as following pretreatment with dexamethasone (Dex). Method(s): Adult male rats were exposed to whole BI. HPA axis responses were examined at 2, 4, 9 and 20 weeks after BI. Histological evaluations of the irradiated rats and matched controls were conducted at 4 and 20 weeks after BI. Result(s): In contrast to the control group, the basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels were enhanced at 9 and 20 weeks after BI and the inhibitory effect of Dex was reduced. BI also caused hyposuppression of the adrenocortical response to stress. Histological assessment of the irradiated brains revealed hippocampal atrophy at 20 weeks after BI. The neuronal counts were lower only in the CA1 region of the irradiated brains. BI caused a decrease in the binding capacity of Dex to the hippocampal cytosolic fraction. Conclusion(s): Enhanced stress-induced HPA axis responses and the reduced effect of Dex suggest that BI has delayed effects on HPA axis responses as manifested by impairment of the negative feedback exerted by glucocorticoids (GCs). The mechanisms underlying these effects of BI are unknown. It is possible that the marked BI-induced damage in the hippocampus, which plays an important role in the regulation of the feedback effect of GCs, may cause abnormal HPA axis responses following BI. © 2012 S.

OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional (3D) image fusion is associated with lower radiation exposure, contrast agent dose, and operative time during endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of this technology on carotid artery stenting (CAS).METHODS: We identified consecutive CAS procedures from 2009 to 2017 and compared those performed with and without 3D image fusion. For image fusion, we created a 3D reconstruction of the aortic arch anatomy based on preoperative computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography that we merged with two-dimensional fluoroscopy, allowing 3D image overlay. We compared radiation exposure, fluoroscopy time, contrast agent dose, time to common carotid artery (CCA) cannulation, time from CCA cannulation to completion angiography, and total procedure time in procedures with and without image fusion. We also assessed rates of 30-day stroke/death, in-hospital and 30-day stroke, and acute kidney injury. We used multivariable linear regression to adjust for patient and procedural characteristics and used these models to compute the marginal effects of image fusion compared with no image fusion.RESULTS: There were 46 patients who underwent CAS with a 3D image fusion system and 70 patients without. Patients undergoing CAS with image fusion experienced 31% lower radiation exposure compared with the control group (207 +/- 23 mGy vs 300 +/- 26 mGy, respectively; P < .01), shorter fluoroscopy time (21 +/- 6 minutes vs 24 +/- 8 minutes; P = .02), shorter time to carotid cannulation (21 +/- 9 minutes vs 31 +/- 8 minutes; P < .001), and shorter total procedure time (47 +/- 13 minutes vs 54 +/- 18 minutes; P = .03). There was no difference in contrast material volume, time from CCA cannulation to completion angiography, or total in-room time. After multivariable adjustment, 3D image fusion remained associated with lower radiation dose, shorter fluoroscopy time, and shorter time to carotid cannulation (all P < .05). The rate of 30-day stroke/death was 2.7% (three strokes and no deaths at 30 days), and the rate of acute kidney injury was 1.8%.CONCLUSIONS: CAS with 3D image fusion was associated with lower radiation exposure and shorter time to CCA cannulation.

3661,"Glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic currents in ganglion cells from isolated retinae of pigmented rats during postnatal development. This study was aimed at characterizing the earliest phases of synaptogenesis in the mammalian retina. Spontaneous activity of ganglion cells in the isolated superfused retina was used as an indicator for the functionality of synaptic connections. Retinal ganglion neurons (RGNs) were identified by location of their somata in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and by their ability to generate large (> 500 pA) voltage-activated sodium currents. Spontaneous spiking was found in many RGNs prior to cell perfusion. Between postnatal day (P) 1 and 18, a total of 195 RGNs was tested for light-induced currents, conductance changes in response to exogenous glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and depolarizing or hyperpolarizing synaptic activity. The vast majority of the material was derived from RGNs at day P5. Whole-cell ion currents were always sampled at somatic sites, using either conventional or perforated patch whole-cell recordings. On day P5, 5% of tested RGNs (n = 73) were already responsive to light stimulation. A higher percentage of cells (23%, n = 187) generated spontaneous depolarizing currents that were regarded as glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), since (1) they were blocked by Glu antagonists, (2) they conformed to the Na+/Cs+ equilibrium potential, (3) and they displayed a time course characteristic of glutamatergic EPSCs. The mean EPSC amplitude was 19.0 pA (S.D. 11.83 pA). Amplitude distributions were fitted by multiple Gaussian equations rendering a quantal size of 6.6 to 9.1 pA at a holding voltage (Vh) of -70 mV (driving force about 70 mV). Spontaneous EPSCs were never observed under condition of Ca(2+)-free solutions, but they persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin. Bath application of quisqualate (500 microM) consistently increased EPSC frequencies. In contrast to the relatively high percentage of RGNs generating spontaneous EPSCs, very few RGNs at P5 (3%, n = 187) displayed inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), although by that time all tested RGNs (n = 14) were responsive to both exogenous Glu and GABA. These results indicate that in the postnatal rat retina development of excitatory synapses precedes the maturation of inhibitory afferents. Excitatory inputs to RGNs were to some extent functional before the animals opened their eyes. Glutamatergic synaptic activity may, thus, play an important role in shaping visual connections in the absence of visual experience.",Excluded

4677,"PIDD Mediates Radiation-Induced Microglia Activation. Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is the most common adverse effect that occurs after cranial radiation therapy (CRT). We have previously reported that CRT-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in brain tissues and inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampus might be caused by microglial activation and may play an important role in RIBI. In this study we examined the role of p53-induced protein with a death domain (PIDD) in radiation-induced activation of BV-2 cells. BV-2 cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotide control mRNA or antisense oligonucleotide-targeted PIDD mRNA and were sham or 16 Gy irradiated. The state of microglia and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Findings from this study suggest that silencing PIDD expression could inhibit microglial activation by downregulating the PIDD-C/NF-kappabeta transcription pathway. PIDD acts as a critical switcher between the NF-kappabeta transcription pathway and radiation-induced apoptosis. Given these findings, this study offers a potential novel approach to further combination treatment of RIBI.",Included

OBJECT: Pituitary adenomas, which are common intracranial tumors, are associated with significant patient morbidity due to hormone secretion or mass effect or as a complication of therapy. Epigenetic regulation has emerged as an important component of malignant tumor pathogenesis, although the contribution in the progression of benign pituitary tumors remains largely unexplored. The present study evaluates the effect of anacardic acid (6-pentadecyl salicylic acid), a natural histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, on pituitary adenoma cells.METHODS: The concentration- and time-dependent effects of anacardic acid on the viability of GH3 and MMQ pituitary adenoma cells were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell cycle phase distribution, protein expression, and percentage of apoptotic cells were assessed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Colony forming assays were used to study the radiosensitizing effect of anacardic acid.RESULTS: The present study identifies a novel antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect of anacardic acid on pituitary adenoma cells. These effects were associated with an increase in poly([adenosine diphosphate]-ribose) polymerase cleavage, sub-G1 arrest, and annexin V staining, consistent with apoptotic cell death; however, the pancaspase inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone failed to reverse anacardic acid-induced cell death, suggesting a possible nonclassical apoptotic mechanism. Anacardic acid also reduced the expression of survivin and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, antiapoptotic proteins associated with cellular survival and radioresistance, and radiosensitized pituitary adenoma cells.CONCLUSIONS: These findings warrant further exploration of anacardic acid as a single agent or as an adjunct to radiation therapy for the treatment of pituitary tumors.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: Despite heterogeneous biology, similar surveillance schemas are utilized after resection of all pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Given concerns regarding excess radiation exposure and financial burden, our aim was to develop a prognostic score for disease recurrence to guide individually tailored surveillance strategies.METHODS: All patients with primary nonfunctioning, nonmetastatic well/moderately differentiated PanNETs who underwent curative-intent resection at 9-institutions from 2000 to 2016 were included (n = 1006). A Recurrence Risk Score (RRS) was developed from a randomly selected derivation cohort comprised of 67% of patients and verified on the validation-cohort comprised of the remaining 33%.RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, patients within the derivation cohort (n = 681) with symptomatic tumors (jaundice, pain, bleeding), tumors >2 cm, Ki67 >3%, and lymph node (LN) (+) disease had increased recurrence. Each factor was assigned a score based on their weighted odds ratio that formed a RRS of 0 to 10: symptomatic = 1, tumor >2 cm = 2, Ki67 3% to 20% = 1, Ki67 >20% = 6, LN (+) = 1. Patients were grouped into low- (RRS = 0-2; n = 247), intermediate-(RRS = 3-5; n = 204), or high (RRS = 6-10; n = 9)-risk groups. At 24 months, 33% of high RRS recurred, whereas only 2% of low and 14% of intermediate RRS recurred. This persisted in the validation cohort (n = 325).CONCLUSIONS: This international, novel, internally validated RRS accurately stratifies recurrence-free survival for patients with resected PanNETs.

Immunoreactive fractions of the radiolabeled antibodies were comparable. Although tumor uptake of the radioiodinated and radiometal labeled 3F8 was much higher than that of the radioiodinated F(ab')2 fragments (maximum percent injected dose per gram values were 39.4, 33.2 and 20.1 for 131I-3F8, 90Y-3F8 and 131I-F(ab')2, respectively), tumor to nontumor ratios were higher for radioiodinated fragments (with the exception of tumor to kidney ratio). For the minimum tumor dose necessary for complete ablation, the bone marrow received 195, 278 and 401 cGy for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8, respectively. Tumor doses were 50.1, 232 and 992 cGy/MBq for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8, respectively. Tumor to bone marrow dose, which is defined as the therapeutic index, was 21.5, 14.7 and 10.4 for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8. 131I-F(ab')2 fragments produced the highest therapeutic index but also the lowest tumor dose for radioimmunotherapy. Radiometal conjugated IgG produced the highest tumor dose but also the lowest therapeutic index.",Excluded
4314,"Blue Light Increases Neuronal Activity-Regulated Gene Expression in the Absence of Optogenetic Proteins. Optogenetics is widely used to control diverse cellular functions with light, requiring experimenters to expose cells to bright light. Because extended exposure to visible light can be toxic to cells, it is important to characterize the effects of light stimulation on cellular function in the absence of optogenetic proteins. Here we exposed mouse cortical cultures with no exogenous optogenetic proteins to several hours of flashing blue, red, or green light. We found that exposing these cultures to as short as 1 h of blue light, but not red or green light, results in an increase in the expression of neuronal activity-regulated genes. Our findings suggest that blue light stimulation is ill suited to long-term optogenetic experiments, especially those that measure transcription, and they emphasize the importance of performing light-only control experiments in samples without optogenetic proteins.",Excluded
4644,"Prolonged photoresponses in transgenic mouse rods lacking arrestin. Arrestins are soluble cytoplasmic proteins that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors, thus switching off activation of the G protein and terminating the signalling pathway that triggers the cellular response. Although visual arrestin has been shown to quench the catalytic activity of photoexcited, phosphorylated rhodopsin in a reconstituted system, its role in the intact rod cell remains unclear because phosphorylation alone reduces the catalytic activity of rhodopsin. Here we have recorded photocurrents of rods from transgenic mice in which one or both copies of the arrestin gene were disrupted. Photoresponses were unaffected when arrestin expression was halved, indicating that arrestin binding is not rate limiting for recovery of the rod photoresponse, as it is in Drosophila. With arrestin absent, the flash response displayed a rapid partial recovery followed by a prolonged final phase. This behaviour indicates that an arrestin-independent mechanism initiates the quench of rhodopsin's catalytic activity and that arrestin completes the quench. The intensity dependence of the photoresponse in rods lacking arrestin further suggests that, although arrestin is required for normal signal termination, it does not participate directly in light adaptation.",Excluded
4300,"A ciliary opsin in the brain of a marine annelid zooplankton is ultraviolet-sensitive, and the sensitivity is tuned by a single amino acid residue. Ciliary opsins were classically thought to function only in vertebrates for vision, but they have also been identified recently in invertebrates for non-visual photoreception. Larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii are used as a zooplankton model, and this zooplankton species possesses a ""vertebrate-type"" ciliary opsin (named c-opsin) in the brain. Platynereis c-opsin is suggested to relay light signals for melatonin production and circadian behaviors. Thus, the spectral and biochemical characteristics of this c-opsin would be directly related to non-visual photoreception in this zooplankton model. Here we demonstrate that the c-opsin can sense UV to activate intracellular signaling cascades and that it can directly bind exogenous all-trans-retinal. These results suggest that this c-opsin regulates circadian signaling in a UV-dependent manner and that it does not require a supply of 11-cis-retinal for photoreception. Avoidance of damaging UV irradiation is a major cause of large-scale daily zooplankton movement, and the observed capability of the c-opsin to transmit UV signals and bind all-trans-retinal is ideally suited for sensing UV radiation in the brain, which presumably lacks enzymes producing 11-cis-retinal. Mutagenesis analyses indicated that a unique amino acid residue (Lys-94) is responsible for c-opsin-mediated UV sensing in the Platynereis brain. We therefore propose that acquisition of the lysine residue in the c-opsin would be a critical event in the evolution of Platynereis to enable detection of ambient UV light. In summary, our findings indicate that the c-opsin possesses spectral and biochemical properties suitable for UV sensing by the zooplankton model.",Excluded
4631,"Radiation exposure during transmission measurements: comparison between CT- and germanium-based techniques with a current PET scanner. In positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning, transmission measurements for attenuation correction are commonly performed by using external germanium-68 rod sources. Recently, combined PET and computed tomographic (CT) scanners have been developed in which the CT data can be used for both anatomical-metabolic image formation and attenuation correction of the PET data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference between germanium- and CT-based transmission scanning in terms of their radiation doses by using the same measurement technique and to compare the doses that patients receive during brain, cardiac and whole-body scans. Measurement of absorbed doses to organs was conducted by using a Rando Alderson phantom with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Effective doses were calculated according to the guidelines in the International Commission on Radiation Protection Publication Number 60. Compared with radionuclide doses used in routine 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET imaging, doses absorbed during germanium-based transmission scans were almost negligible. On the other hand, absorbed doses from CT-based transmission scans were significantly higher, particularly with a whole-body scanning protocol. Effective doses were 8.81 mSv in the high-speed mode and 18.97 mSv in the high-quality mode for whole-body CT-based transmission scans. These measurements revealed that the doses received by a patient during CT-based transmission scanning are more than those received in a typical PET examination. Therefore, the radiation doses represent a limitation to the generalised use of CT-based transmission measurements with current PET/CT scanner systems.",Excluded
3788,"Reverberation challenges the temporal representation of the pitch of complex sounds. Accurate neural coding of the pitch of complex sounds is an essential part of auditory scene analysis; differences in pitch help segregate concurrent sounds, while similarities in pitch can help group sounds from a common source. In quiet, nonreverberant backgrounds, pitch can be derived from timing information in broadband high-frequency auditory channels and/or from frequency and timing information carried in narrowband low-frequency auditory channels. Recording from single neurons in the cochlear nucleus of anesthetized guinea pigs, we show that the neural representation of pitch based on timing information is severely degraded in the presence of reverberation. This degradation increases with both increasing reverberation strength and channel bandwidth. In a parallel human psychophysical pitch-discrimination task, reverberation impaired the ability to distinguish a high-pass harmonic sound from noise. Together, these findings explain the origin of perceptual difficulties experienced by both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in reverberant spaces.",Excluded

The animal model of electromagnetic radiation was established. Western blot was used to detect the expression of RKIP, and RT-PCR was applied to detect the expression of RKIP mRNA. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 was measured with co-immunoprecipitation method, and the expression of cerebral choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) was measured by immunohistochemistry. The expression of RKIP significantly down-regulated at 6 h after radiation, and recovered at 1 d in group EMP, but the down-regulation continued during 1 approximately 7 d after radiation in the two microwave groups. The expression of RKIP mRNA changed wavily during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, which showed down-regulation at 6 h, and up-regulation at 3 d. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 decreased during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, most significantly at 7 d, and the two microwave groups were more significant. The expression of CHAT decreased continuously during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, and generally recovered on 14 d.

4269,"Modulation of cone horizontal cell activity in the teleost fish retina. III. Effects of prolonged darkness and dopamine on electrical coupling between horizontal cells. The effects of prolonged darkness and dopamine on the coupling between horizontal cells in the isolated, superfused white perch retina were studied. Two assays of coupling were employed; area versus amplitude relationships (area-response curves) and the diffusion of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow from intracellularly injected cells to neighboring cells. In prolonged dark-adapted retinas, area-response curves were difficult to determine because of the small light responses; however, light-evoked responses did not increase in size when light spots were larger than 0.8 mm in diameter. Following the presentation of dim background illumination that partially sensitized the retina, responses to light spots of various sizes were enhanced and an area-response curve could be constructed. Subsequent presentation of moderate background illumination that more fully sensitized the retina resulted in reduced responses to small spots (less than 1.6 mm in diameter) and enhanced responses to large spot or full-field stimuli. In retinas exposed to moderate background illumination, Lucifer yellow injected intracellularly into cone horizontal cells diffused into many neighboring horizontal cells. The coupled cells were very similar in morphology, suggesting they were of the same type. In prolonged dark-adapted retinas, on the other hand, the dye was usually restricted to the injected cell and a few adjacent cells. These results indicate that coupling between cone horizontal cells is modulated by prolonged darkness and background illumination. Following dopamine (50 microM) application, in both 6-OHDA-treated and untreated retinas, changes in area-response curves of cone horizontal cells were observed just opposite to those that occurred when prolonged dark-adapted retinas were exposed to background illumination. That is, following 5 min application of dopamine to the retina, responses to small spots (less than 2 mm in diameter) increased in size while responses to larger spots decreased in amplitude compared with control responses. Following 20 min of superfusion with dopamine, the recorded responses were very small, and an accurate area-response curve could not be determined. Following dopamine application to light-sensitized retinas, Lucifer yellow was restricted to the injected cells or to the injected cell and a few neighboring cells. The results suggest that the modulation of coupling between cone horizontal cells by prolonged darkness and background illumination may be mediated by dopamine. Spatial properties of rod horizontal cells were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Excluded

Hindlimb unloading (HU) can cause motion and cognition dysfunction, although its cellular and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the stereological parameters of the brain areas involved in motion (motor cortex) and spatial learning - memory (hippocampus) under an HU condition. Sixteen adult male rats, kept under a 12: 12 h light-dark cycle, were divided into two groups of freely moving (n=8) and HU (n=8) rats. The volume of motor cortex and hippocampus, the numerical cell density of neurons in layers I, II-III, V, and VI of the motor cortex, the entire motor cortex as well as the primary motor cortex, and the numerical density of the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus subregions of the hippocampus were estimated. No significant differences were observed in the evaluated parameters. Our results thus indicated that motor cortical and hippocampal atrophy and cell loss may not necessarily be involved in the motion and spatial learning memory impairment in the rat.

4754,"Aggressive and malignant prolactin pituitary tumors: pathological diagnosis and patient management. According to the World Health Organization classification of pituitary tumors, only tumors with systemic metastasis must be considered as carcinomas. Invasive tumors with multiple recurrences are only classified as aggressive tumors or ""atypical adenomas"". To illustrate the problems encountered in the pathological diagnosis of pituitary carcinoma and in patient management, we present two male patients operated on for an aggressive prolactin pituitary adenoma with and without metastasis. In case 1, 5 surgeries, 3 irradiations, increased doses of dopamine agonists, and trials of temozolomide and carboplatine-VP16 failed to control tumor progression and the appearance of metastases which lead to death 16 years after onset. In case 2, based on the initial diagnosis of an aggressive-invasive adenoma that was resistant to dopamine agonists, gamma-Knife irradiation was initially performed on the intra-cavernous remnant. Eight years after onset, the remnant remained stabilized and the plasma PRL normalized under dopamine agonist. From these 2 cases alongside other cases found in the literature, we propose that the association of certain clinical signs (male sex, dopamine-resistant hyperprolactinemia), radiological signs (invasive macro or giant tumor on MRI) and histological signs (angiogenesis, Ki-67 > 3%, p53 positive, mitoses >2 per high power field, vascular invasion, up-regulation of genes related to invasion and proliferation, and allelic loss of chromosome 11) might suggest aggressiveness and be suspicious of malignancy before the appearance of metastasis. The early detection of an aggressive phenotype of a prolactin pituitary tumor should permit the earlier establishment of the optimum therapeutic strategy associating surgery and radiotherapy to delay or inhibit metastasis.",Excluded
3643,"Exposure to different wavelengths of light and the development of structural and functional asymmetries in the chicken. The thalamofugal visual projections of the chick are known to develop in response to stimulation by light prior to hatching, and asymmetry in the number of projections develops as a consequence of the embryo being oriented in the egg so that it occuludes its left eye. The right eye only is stimulated by light and this causes the visual projections connected to the right eye to develop in advance of those connected to the left. We have now found that exposure of embryos, from day 19 of incubation to hatching, to red (peak transmission at 670 nm) or green (peak at 500 nm) light is as effective as broad-spectrum (white) light in establishing asymmetry in these projections. The intensities of the light to which the embryos were exposed in each case were equivalent, achieved in part by removing the air sac end of the egg shell. The thalamofugal visual projections, therefore, develop in response to light stimulation but appear to have no wavelength specificity. This result is consistent with the apparent lack of involvement of the thalamofugal visual pathway in colour vision. However, functional asymmetry, tested as left-right eye differences in categorising grain from pebbles, was found to be less marked in the chicks that had been exposed to green light compared to those that had been exposed to 'while' light, and it was absent in those exposed to red light or incubated in the dark. Thus, there is wavelength specificity for the development of the behavioural asymmetry, which suggests involvement of colour-coded neurons outside the thalamofugal visual pathway, probably in the tectofugal pathway. Exposure of the embryos to red and green light alternating at 30 min intervals is as effective as ""white' light for establishing both the structural and functional asymmetry.",Excluded
4377,"[The stimulating impact of light on brain cognition function]. Light regulates multiple non-visual circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral functions, and conveys a strong stimulating signal for alert-ness and cognition. This review summarizes a series of neuroimaging studies investigating the brain mechanisms underlying the latter stimulating impact of light. Results of these studies are compatible with a scenario where light would first hit subcortical areas involved in arousal regulation before affecting cortical areas involved in the ongoing non-visual cognitive process, and then cognitive performance. Recent data demonstrated that the non-visual impact of light is most likely triggered via outputs from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which are maximally sensitive to blue light. In addition, the stimulating impact of light is intimately related to wakefulness regulation as it changes with circadian phase and sleep pressure. Finally, markers of inter-individual difference have also been described: age, PERIOD3 genotype, and psychiatric status. This review emphasizes the importance of light for human brain cognitive function and for cognition in general.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Case reports and animal studies suggest combining radiation and immunotherapy may generate responses outside the radiation field. We sought to explore this phenomenon in a systematic fashion by evaluating melanoma patients with brain metastases who were treated with both radiation and ipilimumab. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of sixteen consecutive patients who received ipilimumab and 51 courses of braindirected radiation at a single institution from 2008 to 2013. We examined responses of the largest ""index"" extra-cranial lesion after 31 of these courses where imaging was available before and after treatment and compared this response to two consecutive studies performed prior to radiation therapy when available. Overall survival was calculated from the last day of the first brain-directed radiation therapy course using the Kaplan-Meier method. Responses before and after radiation therapy were compared using McNemar's and the binomial tests for clustered data. Twogroup exact tests for clustered data were used to explore the impact of treatment timing on response. Result(s): Median survival after initial radiation was 14 months, with maximum survival of 50 months. After radiation therapy, the largest index extra-cranial lesion shrank in 35% of 31 instances with sequential imaging as compared to a 17% favorable response rate in the 25 instances with two scans prior to radiation (p = 0.20). There was also a 2.8-fold increased likelihood that the kinetics of index lesion response improved following radiation therapy that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). Index lesions were more likely to respond when ipilimumab was administered within three months of radiation (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Historical series of melanoma patients with brain metastases describe median survival of less than 6 months, and less than 4 months in patients treated with radiation therapy without surgery for these lesions. Our data suggest patients treated with ipilimumab and radiation therapy may fare better than these historical controls.

3790,"Adrenergic control of rat pineal NO synthase. We have previously shown that exposure of rats to constant light (LL) induced a decrease in NO synthase (NOS) activity in the pineal gland. We present here the evidence that chronic (5 days) norepinephrine (NE) or isoproterenol treatment prevents the effect of LL and enhances pineal NOS activity in LL animals. This effect of NE appears to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, because it was not mimicked by the alpha-agonist phenylephrine. Pineal NOS activity was reduced in 16-h light/8-h dark animals treated for 4 days with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but not with the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin, indicating again an involvement of beta-adrenergic receptor in the control of NOS. Treatment with adrenergic antagonists did not affect cortical NOS activity, suggesting that the control of NOS is different in these two tissues or that the pineal expresses a specific isoform of the enzyme. Taken together, these data suggest that NE controls NOS in the pineal gland through beta-adrenergic receptors. To our knowledge, this represent the first demonstration of a regulation of NOS by a neurotransmitter in the CNS, as assayed under Vmax conditions.",Excluded

The first DI, NEXUS Chest x-ray, consists of seven criteria (Age >60years; rapid deceleration mechanism; chest pain; intoxication; altered mental status; distracting painful injury; and chest wall tenderness) and exhibits a sensitivity of 99.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98.2-99.4%) and a specificity of 13.3% (95% CI, 12.6%-14.0%) for detecting clinically significant injuries.

4002,"SRS of brain AVM. Brain AVM was one of the first pathologies treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, notably the Gammaknife. Almost all treatment and outcome models are thus derived from the abundance of data from Gammaknife treatment. Due to differences in radiation dose distribution these models may not be fully applicable to treatment with linear accelerator or proton beam generator. The results from SRS of brain AVMare predictable and depend on a few well defined parameters: The chance for obliteration depends on the radiation dose to the periphery of the AVM nidus. Typically a radiation dose of 25Gy will incure an 80% chance for obliteration over a three year period. The risk for adverse radiation effects (oedema, radionecrosis, cysts) depends on the amount of energy deposited into the target and the surrounding brain. Thus the higher the radiation dose and the bigger the target the higher the risk. The risk for hemorrhage during the latency period before occlusion (maximum of three years) depends on the radiation dose to the periphery of the nidus, the nidus volume, previous recent hemorrhage and probably AVM location. Thus the higher the radiation dose and the smaller the target - the lower the risk for hemorrhage. Previous recent hemorrhage and central AVM location increases the risk.",Excluded

Each patient had both a planning CT and weekly repeated CT. Simulated plans that were generated by using the same beam configurations mapped to the repeated CT represented the actual delivered doses to the target volumes and OARs. An IMRT replanning was performed with the fifth week CT scan. Doses among the initial plan, the simulated plans and replanning were compared.RESULTS: There were no significant dosimetric differences in the gross tumour volume, clinical target volume (CTV) 1 or CTV2 for either the simulated plans or the replanning compared with the initial plan. Dosimetric variability of both parotid glands and the brain stem were unique to each individual, and doses to the spinal cord were always maintained within the limit. Replanning in the fifth week had significantly decreased the doses delivered to both parotids (p-values of the mean dose were 0.015 and 0.026 for the left and right parotid, respectively), whereas it did not reduce the doses to the brain stem and spinal cord.

These results suggest that PKCalpha is an important modulator that affects bipolar cell signal transduction and termination. Confocal microscopy of retinal sections showed that PKCalpha co-localized with calbindin, which indicates a PKCalpha localization in close proximity to the horizontal cell terminals. In addition, the implicit time of the ERG c-wave originating from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the recovery of photoreceptors from bleaching conditions were substantially faster in the knockout mice than in the wild-type control animals.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PKCalpha is a modulator of rod-bipolar cell function by accelerating glutamate-driven signal transduction and termination.

Introduction: We expanded upon our previous experience using involved-field fractionated radiotherapy (IFRT) as an alternative to whole brain radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with surgically resected brain metastases (BM). Material(s) and Method(s): All patients with single BM who underwent surgical resection followed by IFRT at our institution from 2006 to 2013 were evaluated. Local recurrence (LR)-free survival, distant failure (DF)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were determined. Analyses were performed associating clinical variables with LR and DF. Salvage approaches and toxicity of treatment for each patient were also assessed. Result(s): Median follow-up was 19.1 months. Fifty-six patients were treated with a median dose of 40.05 Gy/15 fractions with IFRT to the resection cavity. LR-free survival was 91.4%, DF-free survival was 68.4%, and OS was 77.7% at 12 months. No variables were associated with increased LR; however, melanoma histopathology and infratentorial location were associated with DF on multivariate analysis.

3960,"Calbindin-D28K cells in the hamster SCN express light-induced Fos. Although the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) have been intensively analyzed, they contain a population of cells that has not yet been characterized. In this study, we examined the distribution of cells immunoreactive (ir) for calbindin-D28K (CaBP), calretinin (CR), parvalbumin, vasopressin-associated neurophysin (NP), substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and light-induced Fos-like protein. Previously unidentified cells in the core of the hamster SCN contained CaBP. Photic stimulation during the night induced Fos expression in about 75% of the CaBP-positive SCN cells, and about 50% of the Fos-positive cells in the core region expressed CaBP. These findings provide new information in the search for the cellular localization of pacemaker cells in the SCN, as photic input entrains the circadian system, and cells that receive photic input must be either part of the clock itself, or an upstream component of the clock.",Excluded
4512,"Short-term synaptic depression and recovery at the mature mammalian endbulb of Held synapse in mice. The endbulb of Held synapses between the auditory nerve fibers (ANF) and cochlear nucleus bushy neurons convey fine temporal information embedded in the incoming acoustic signal. The dynamics of synaptic depression and recovery is a key in regulating synaptic transmission at the endbulb synapse. We studied short-term synaptic depression and recovery in mature (P22-38) CBA mice with stimulation rates that were comparable to sound-driven activities recorded in vivo. Synaptic depression in mature mice is less severe ( approximately 40% at 100 Hz) than reported for immature animals and the depression is predominately due to depletion of releasable vesicles. Recovery from depression depends on the rate of activity and accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ at the presynaptic terminal. With a regular stimulus train at 100 Hz in 2 mM external [Ca2+], the recovery from depletion was slow (tauslow, approximately 2 s). In contrast, a fast (taufast, approximately 25 ms), Ca2+-dependent recovery followed by a slower recovery (tauslow, approximately 2 s) was seen when stimulus rates or external [Ca2+] increased. In normal [Ca2+], recovery from a 100-Hz Poisson-like train is rapid, suggesting that Poisson-like trains produce a higher internal [Ca2+] than regular trains. Moreover, the fast recovery was slowed by approximately twofold in the presence of calmidazolium, a Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitor. Our results suggest that endbulb synapses from high spontaneous firing rate auditory nerve fibers normally operate in a depressed state. The accelerated synaptic recovery during high rates of activity is likely to ensure that reliable synaptic transmission can be achieved at the endbulb synapse.",Excluded
4112,"Background field removal using spherical mean value filtering and Tikhonov regularization. PURPOSE: To introduce a new method for removing background artifacts in field maps and apply it to enhance the accuracy of susceptibility mapping.METHODS: A field artifact removal method is introduced that is based on the sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction for phase data (SHARP) method exploiting the harmonic mean value property. The new method uses Tikhonov regularization at the deconvolution stage and is referred to as regularization enabled SHARP (RESHARP). RESHARP was compared with SHARP in a field-forward susceptibility simulation and in human brain experiments, considering effects on both field maps and the resulting susceptibility maps.RESULTS: From the simulation, RESHARP was able to reduce error in the field map by 17.4% as compared with SHARP, resulting in a more accurate single-angle susceptibility map with 6.5% relative error (compared with 48.5% using SHARP). Using RESHARP in vivo, field and susceptibility maps of the brain displayed fewer artifacts particularly at the brain boundaries, and susceptibility measurements of iron-rich deep gray matter were also more consistent than SHARP across healthy subjects of similar age.CONCLUSION: Compared with SHARP, RESHARP removes background field artifact more effectively, leading to more accurate susceptibility measurements in iron-rich deep gray matter.",Excluded

[(11)C]MeS-IMPY ([S-methyl-(11)C]N,N-dimethyl-4-(6-(methylthio)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-yl)aniline) is a potential radioligand for imaging beta-amyloid plaques with positron emission tomography (PET). The aims of this study were to evaluate [(11)C]MeS-IMPY uptake in nonhuman primate brain and to estimate radiation exposure from serial whole-body images. Eight PET studies were performed in rhesus monkeys to measure the brain uptake and washout of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY. Time-activity data were analyzed with one-tissue and two-tissue compartmental models using radiometabolite-corrected plasma input function. In addition, two whole-body PET scans were acquired for 120 min to determine the biodistribution of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY. Tomographic PET images were compressed into a single planar image to identify organs with the highest radiation exposures. Estimates of the absorbed dose of radiation were calculated using OLINDA 1.0. Injection of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY caused little change in pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature. [(11)C]MeS-IMPY showed high standardized brain uptake values of approximately 500% and 600% between 2 and 3 min in cortical regions and the cerebellum, respectively. The brain uptake of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY was widespread and quite uniform across all cortical regions. Activity rapidly washed out of the brain, with 20% of peak activity remaining at 40 min. Thus, all brain regions showed minimal retention of radioactivity, consistent with these healthy young animals having negligible amyloid plaques. Regional brain activity fitted well into a one-tissue compartment model. The average volume of distribution in all brain regions was 7.66+/-2.14 ml/cm(3) (n=4). The organs with the highest radiation exposure (muSv/MBq) were the gallbladder wall (33.4), urinary bladder (17) and lungs (12.9), with a resulting effective dose of 4.9 microSv/MBq (18 mrem/mCi). The high brain uptake, rapid washout and quantifiable volume of distribution in nonhuman primate brain further support the evaluation of [(11)C]MeS-IMPY. Calculated dosimetry results are comparable with those for other (11)C-labeled brain imaging radioligands.",Excluded

4194,"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure. Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236+/-9 mum and GC: 215+/-5 mum) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4+/-1.6 mum; GC: 12.2+/-1.2 mum). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4+/-0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4+/-0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.",Included
4414,"Head and neck tumor cell radiation response occurs in the presence of IGF1. Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer results in severe secondary side-effects in salivary glands. We previously demonstrated that the administration of IGF1 preserves or restores salivary gland function following radiation. Based on these findings, we propose to study the effect of IGF1 on human head and neck carcinoma cells. Head and neck tumor cells treated with radiation have significant reductions in tumor cell survival, as measured by MTT and crystal violet assays, regardless of IGF1 pre-treatment. Head and neck squamous carcinoma cell xenografts treated with concurrent radiation+IGF1 also exhibit significant tumor growth delay; however, growth rates are elevated compared with those in irradiated xenografts. In contrast, administration of IGF1 after radiation treatment has no effect on tumor xenograft growth rates. Analysis of these data suggests that localized delivery may be required for concurrent therapy to prevent secondary side-effects of radiotherapy, while post-therapy administration of IGF1 could be considered for the restoration of salivary function.",Excluded

Introduction: Due to a relative low incidence of spinal ependymomas in adults, a definitive therapeutic strategy is still missing. Therefore, different concepts are under discussion without a uniform standard of therapy and diagnostics. Material(s) and Method(s): We evaluated all spinal ependymomas treated surgically from 03/2006 until 05/2012 at our department. This consecutive, retrospective series includes 41 patients: 23 female, 18 male, median age 51 y. (range 21-80). 22 Ependymomas were located intramedullary, 18 within cauda equina or filum terminale, 1 patient presented with multifocal spinal lesions including both, intramedullar and extramedullar lesions. Perioperative standard diagnostic of most tumors included a holospinal MRI and a CSF cytology. First follow-up MRI and exam was done 3 months postoperatively, further controls every year in case of stable findings. Current median follow-up is 29 months (range 3-72). Preoperative, early postoperative and follow-up clinical performance was evaluated according to the modified McCormick scale. Postoperative deterioration was dichotomized in ""slight"" (=deterioration without any increase of the modified McCormick scale grades or an increase in only one grade within the scale range 1-2) and ""significant"" (=increase to grade 7ge;3 on the modified McCormick scale). Result(s): Preoperatively, the vast majority presented neurologically intact or with mild deficits maintaining functional independence according to the modified McCormick scale. The most common preoperative symptom was pain (78%), followed by sensory deficits (54%), gait ataxia (34%), motor deficits (27%), and bowel/bladder dysfunction (12%). In only one patient the ependymoma was found incidentally. Gross total resection (GTR) could be achieved in 85% (n=35) (subtotal resection n=5, debulking of the main tumor mass of a multifocal disease n=1). Histology: the majority were WHO IIdegree (n=30), 10 WHOdegreeI tumours, 1 case of anaplastic ependymoma WHOdegreeIII. Immediately after surgery 24% (n=10) showed worsening of neurological symptoms, but in most cases only mild new deficits occurred. During follow up 78% (n=32) showed at least preop status, 37% (n=15) improved. In only 5% (n=2) a permanent significant deterioration remained. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed after the first surgery in two cases: in one patient with drop metastasis after the GTR of the main tumour, and in another patient with multifocal lesions after debulking, both were WHOdegreeII ependymomas. Tumour recurrence was seen in 4 cases, so far: 3 WHOdegreeII, 1 WHOdegreeI, 2 of them despite previous GTR and 1 despite adjuvant radiation. Median progression free survival was 22 months (range 6-43). 2 patients died of meningeosis 19 and 31 months after the initial diagnosis, respectively. Conclusion(s): Gross-total resection still stays the main column of ependymoma therapy. In our series this could be achieved in 85% accompanied by a rate of 5% for significant persistent deficits. In cases of incomplete resection stereotactic radiotherapy as well as a wait and see srategy can be considered. In case of disseminated disease holospinal radiation with a boost to the primary tumour site is recommended. Due to the risk of recurrence, close follow up with clinical and imaging examinations are mandatory.",Excluded

Purpose or Objective: To evaluate neurocognitive function (NCF) and clinical outcomes after early hippocampal avoidance (HA) prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited disease (LD) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in a multicenter phase II trial (SAKK 15/12). Material(s) and Method(s): In a phase II trial, patients with LD SCLC received HA-PCI of 25 Gy in 10 fractions concomitant to the 2nd cycle of chemotherapy (CHT) and thoracic radiotherapy. All patients underwent objective NCF testing at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months after HA-PCI. NCF tests included Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R), Controlled Oral Word Association (COWAT), and Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and B. The primary endpoint was NCF decline at 6 months after HA-PCI. We assumed a rate of <= 30% of patients with no NCF decline as unpromising. Secondary endpoints included brain metastases free survival (BMFS), overall survival (OS), and safety of the concomitant treatment. Result(s): Among the 44 patients enrolled in the trial, 38 had evaluable NCF assessment at 6 months after HA-PCI. The rate of evaluable patients showing no NCF decline at 6 and 12 months was 34.2% (90% CI: 21.6 - 48.8%) and 48.5% (95% CI: 30.8 - 66.5%), respectively (Figure 1). Median follow-up was 13.2 months (95% CI: 12.6 - 14.1). At 12 months, the rate of BMFS was 84.2% (95% CI: 68.1 - 92.8%), and of OS was 87.7% (95% CI: 73.0 - 94.7%). Four patients died due to SCLC, 1 due to respiratory failure, 1 due to hemorrhage, and 1 for unknown reason.

Background: We aim to explore the relationship between minimum point dose (Dmin) to the primary gross tumor volume (GTV_P) and local control in treating T3-4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Methods: Ninety-six non-metastatic T3-4 NPC patients were enrolled between January 2009 and November 2013. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil (TPF) chemotherapy was administered. The prescribed dose was 66-70.4 Gy to the GTV_P while maintaining all the critical neurologic organs within dose constraints.Results: The local response rate was 88.6% after induction chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the 3-year local failure-free survival (LFFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 92.4% and 89.6%, respectively. The average Dmin to the GTV_P was 59.4 Gy (range, 48.3-70.4 Gy). Additionally, 54.0 Gy was identified as the optimal cut-off Dmin to the GTV_P, and the Dmin >=54.0 Gy group had a better local complete response rate after IMRT (52.4% vs. 81.3%, chi2 = 7.335, P = 0.007), a better 3-year LFFS (95.9% vs. 78.4%, P = 0.005) and a better OS (93.3% vs. 75.9%, P = 0.003). Furthermore, a multivariate analysis found the Dmin to the GTV_P >=54.0 Gy to be prognostically important for LFFS and OS. One patient (1%) developed asymptomatic temporal lobe necrosis, but no other neurological dysfunctions were observed.Conclusions: For T3-4-stage NPC treated with IMRT plus TPF chemotherapy, excellent local control with few late toxicities was achieved. A Dmin >=54.0 Gy to the GTV_P may confer better local control. New ways to increase the Dmin to the GTV_P as far as possible without increasing late toxicities are urgently required.",Excluded

However, increased specific absorption rate (SAR) prohibits the application of spatial saturation band, leading to venous contamination in maximum intensity projection (MIP) images. Method(s): A segmented k-space filling scheme with sparse venous saturation pulses was developed for 7. T TOF-MRA. The effectiveness of the segmented TOF sequence was verified by Bloch equation simulation and experiments on 3. T. The protocol on 7. T was optimized and applied for healthy volunteers and patients with vascular diseases. Result(s): Segmented TOF achieved equivalent contrast and venous suppression effect as conventional methods, while SAR values had a remarkable reduction and obeyed the limit of a 7. T MRI system. The decreased number of saturation pulses allowed shorter acquisition time than existing solutions. The comparison of segmented TOF and conventional TOF revealed flow direction in vascular diseases. Conclusion(s): Segmented TOF is proved to be a time-efficient way to achieve high-resolution angiograms without venous contamination at ultra-high field.

4407,"Space, gravity and the physiology of aging: parallel or convergent disciplines? A mini-review. The abnormal physiology that manifests itself in healthy humans during their adaptation to the microgravity of space has all the features of accelerated aging. The mechano-skeletal and vestibulo-neuromuscular stimuli which are below threshold in space, result in an overall greater than 10-fold more rapid onset and time course of muscle and bone atrophy in space and the development of balance and coordination problems on return to Earth than occur with aging. Similarly, the loss of functional capacity of the cardiovascular system that results in space and continuous bed rest is over 10 times faster than in the course of aging. Deconditioning in space from gravity deprivation has brought attention to the medical hazards of deconditioning on Earth from gravity withdrawal as in sedentary aging. Though seemingly reversible after periods of 6 months in space or its ground analog of bed rest, it remains to be seen whether that will be so after longer exposures. Both adaptation to space and aging do not merely parallel but converge as disorders of mechanotransduction. Like spaceflight, its analog bed rest telescopes the changes observed with aging and serves as a useful clinical model for the study of age-related deconditioning. The convergence of the disciplines of aging, along with gravitational and space physiology is advancing the understanding and prevention of modern lifestyle medical disorders.",Excluded

The search for reliable markers of the disease that could be used for non invasive diagnostics is constantly needed. One of the hypotheses for gait impairment in NPH is the affection of periventricular white matter. METHODS In this study 15 patients were investigated for possible NPH. All patients underwent diagnostic testing (lumbar infusion test and 5 days of external lumbar drainage for diagnosis of NPH). Only the patients with positive diagnostic response were included in the study (n=10), all patients with postive response were finally treated by venriculoperitoneal shunt. All patients underwent MRI examination including T2W, T1W and DTI sequence of the whole brain in axial sections (EPI, TR/TE=12,000/ 89.4 ms, 40 slices with thickness of 2,4 mm, no gap, 128x 128 matrix, FOV 24x24 cm2; along 30 noncollinear gradient directions with b value of 1000 s/mm2, with additional five b=0 images). Anatomical 3D T1W sequence was also acquired. Twenty age matched subjects with Alzheimer disease resulting in marked atrophia and venricular dilatation, without clinical signs of NPH were examined with the same technique. Following parameters were then manually measured: fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in fornix, splenium of corpus callosum, genu of the internal capsule, and optic radiation. The ROIs were placed two slices above the slice where anterior comissure could be detected. A Mann Whitney U test was used for the analysis of the results. Tract based spatial statistics method (TBSS) was also used. RESULTS The fractional anisotropy was decreased significantly in the NPH patient group compared to the controls (p<0,01) in fornix, right genu of the capsula interna and left optical radiation (p< 0,05), the data showed some trend (p<0,1) in ADC of the left and right optical radiation. The results were similar using TBSS. CONCLUSION The DTI measurements may reveal the white matter structural imparirment in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Recent evidence indicates that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) may influence microglial survival, proliferation, and activation, but this has not yet been tested on isolated primary microglia. We compared the effects of individual and combined application of 10 ng/ml GDNF and 1 ng/ml transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) on total cell number, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, DNA nick-end labelling (TUNEL staining), and nitrite and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) secretion in serum-free cultures of primary rat microglia. GDNF as well as TGF-beta1 enhanced the total number of lectin-positive cells and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei, while no effect on proliferation was observed. Both factors suppressed the secretion of nitrite during the first 4 days of culturing, and GDNF but not TGF-beta1 reduced the secretion of LDH in 2-week-old cultures.

3628,"Medical Event Management for Future Deep Space Exploration Missions to Mars. BACKGROUND: Long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs), such as voyages to Mars, will present unique medical challenges for astronaut crews, including communication delays and the inability to return to Earth early. Medical events threaten crewmember lives and increase the risk of mission failure. Managing a range of potential medical events will require excellent technical and nontechnical skills (NTSs). We sought to identify medical events with potential for rescue, range them according to the potential impact on crew health and mission success during LDEMs, and develop a list of NTSs to train for management of in-flight medical events.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight subject matter experts with specializations in surgery, medicine, trauma, spaceflight operations, NTS training, simulation, human factors, and organizational psychology completed online surveys followed by a 2-d in-person workshop. They identified and rated medical events for survivability, mission impact, and impact of crewmember NTSs on outcomes in space.RESULTS: Sudden cardiac arrest, smoke inhalation, toxic exposure, seizure, and penetrating eye injury emerged as events with the highest potential mission impact, greatest potential for survival, and that required excellent NTS for successful management. Key NTS identified to target in training included information exchange, supporting behavior, communication delivery, and team leadership/followership.CONCLUSIONS: With a planned Mars mission on the horizon, training countermeasures need to be developed in the next 3-5 y. These results may inform policy, selection, medical system design, and training scenarios for astronauts to manage in-flight medical events on LDEMs. Findings may extend to surgical and medical care in any rural and remote location.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: After treatment for early glottic carcinoma, a considerable number of patients end up with voice problems that interfere with daily life activities. The objective of this randomized and controlled study was to assess the efficacy of voice therapy in these patients.METHODS: Of 177 patients, 6-120 months after treatment for early glottic carcinoma, 70 patients (40%) suffered from voice impairment based on a 5-item screening questionnaire. Approximately 60% of those 70 patients were not interested in participating in the current study. Twenty-three patients who were willing to participate were assigned randomly either to a voice therapy group (n = 12 patients) or to a control group (n = 11 patients).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of radiotherapy (RT) on intraplaque neovascularization (IPN) in human carotid arteries.BACKGROUND: Exposure of the carotid arteries to RT during treatment for head and neck cancer is associated with increased risk for stroke. However, the effect of RT on IPN, a precursor to intraplaque hemorrhage and thus associated with plaque vulnerability, is unknown.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients who had undergone unilateral RT for head and neck cancer >=2 years previously underwent B-mode and contrast-enhanced ultrasound of both RT-side and non-RT-side carotid arteries. Presence of IPN during contrast-enhanced ultrasound was judged semiquantitatively as grade 0 (absent), grade 1 (present but limited to plaque base), or grade 2 (extensive and noted within plaque body).RESULTS: Of 49 patients studied, 38 (78%) had plaques. The number of plaques was significantly greater in the RT than the non-RT arteries. Overall, 48 of 64 RT-side plaques (75%) had IPN compared with 9 of 23 non-RT-side (39%) plaques (p = 0.002). Among patients with plaques, IPN was present in 81% of patients with RT-side plaques and 41% of patients with non-RT-side plaques (p = 0.004). Grade 0 IPN was significantly more common in patients with non-RT-side plaques (25% vs. 61%; p = 0.002), whereas grade 2 plaques were more common on the RT side (31% vs. 9%; p = 0.03). The only clinical variable that predicted the presence or absence of IPN was RT laterality.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in humans to reveal a significant association between RT and the presence and extent of IPN. This may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the increased stroke risk among survivors of head and neck cancer treated by RT.",Excluded
4783,"Upconversion Nanoparticles-Based Multiplex Protein Activation to Neuron Ablation for Locomotion Regulation. The optogenetic neuron ablation approach enables noninvasive remote decoding of specific neuron function within a complex living organism in high spatiotemporal resolution. However, it suffers from shallow tissue penetration of visible light with low ablation efficiency. This study reports a upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP)-based multiplex proteins activation tool to ablate deep-tissue neurons for locomotion modulation. By optimizing the dopant contents and nanoarchitecure, over 300-fold enhancement of blue (450-470 nm) and red (590-610 nm) emissions from UCNPs is achieved upon 808 nm irradiation. Such emissions simultaneously activate mini singlet oxygen generator and Chrimson, leading to boosted near infrared (NIR) light-induced neuronal ablation efficiency due to the synergism between singlet oxygen generation and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. The loss of neurons severely inhibits reverse locomotion, revealing the instructive role of neurons in controlling motor activity. The deep penetrance NIR light makes the current system feasible for in vivo deep-tissue neuron elimination. The results not only provide a rapidly adoptable platform to efficient photoablate single- and multiple-cells, but also define the neural circuits underlying behavior, with potential for development of remote therapy in diseases.",Excluded
4682,"Effects of background illumination on the horizontal cell responses in the tiger salamander retina. Synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) was studied in the flat-mounted isolated retinas of the tiger salamander. Background illumination expedited the rise time of the HC light response, and the HC response rise time (HCRRT) reached steady state about 2 sec after the onset of the background illumination. The change in HCRRT is probably responsible for the background-induced enhancement of the HC responses to short light stimuli. The amplitude of the HC responses to 100 msec light steps in the presence of background illumination was 2-5 times larger than that measured under dark-adapted conditions. Background illumination exerted little effect on the response rise time in cones and bipolar cells, and thus it caused no significant response enhancement in those cells. The background-induced change in HCRRT correlated closely with the rod voltage but not with the HC voltage. These results suggest that the background-induced change in HCRRT is probably mediated by postsynaptic events in HCs because no significant time course change is observed in photoreceptors and bipolar cells (which share the same synapses with the HCs). A suppressive rod action on the cone inputs in HCs may be responsible for modulating the HCRRT.

Background: MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, and microbleeds are related to cognitive dysfunction in subjects with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Previous studies have usually focused on the location of these vascular markers and did not consider the concomitant effect by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In this study, we aimed to find dose-dependent effects of these MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and white matter tract damage in VCI patients, considering the effect by concomitant AD pathology. Method(s): Participants consisted of 65 patients with mild cognitive impairment associated with small-vessel disease (svMCI) and 69 with subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). Conventional brain MRI scans, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and PIB PET were performed. WMH, lacunes, microbleeds, and PIB retention amount were measured. Multiple regression analyses were used to elucidate the relationship between regional cortical thickness, DTI abnormalities, and each small vessel vascular marker, adjusting the effects by demographic factors and PIB retention amount. Result(s): Higher WMH volume was associated with cortical thinning in bilateral cingulate cortices, right insular cortex, and left lingual gyrus. More lacunes were associated with cortical thinning in the right medial and superior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Microbleeds were not related with regional cortical thinning. Higher PIB retention was associated with cortical thinning in left medial temporal lobe. Independent of other vascular markers and PIB retention amount, larger WMH volume was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in widespread periventricular white matter region. Regardless of PIB retention amount, more lacunes were associated with decreased FA in bilateral posterior and anterior corona radiata, right anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral posterior limb of internal capsule, and bilateral precuneus. Microbleeds had association with decreased FA in the bilateral posterior corona radiata and optic radiation. PIB retention amount was not related with regional FA decrease. The association between neuropsychological scores and vascularmarkers were generally compatible with findings from cortical thickness and DTI analyses. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that small vessel vascular markers in VCI patients are related with regional cortical thinning and white matter abnormalities in a dosedependent manner regardless of AD pathology.",Excluded

CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old patient with cervix carcinoma received combined radiochemotherapy including cisplatin. After a cumulative dose of 240 mg/m(2) the patient suddenly became somnolent and developed a severe tetraparesis and generalized seizures. After ruling out intracranial bleeding, cerebral metastases as well as infectious and metabolic causes of this condition, a severe toxic encephalopathy was diagnosed based on the clinical findings and MRI scans. After symptomatic treatment on the intensive care unit all symptoms were completely reversible.CONCLUSION: Toxic encephalopathy is a rare but dramatic complication of various cytostatic drugs.

4176,"Comparison of responses of neurons in the mouse inferior colliculus to current injections, tones of different durations, and sinusoidal amplitude-modulated tones. We made in vivo whole cell patch-clamp recordings from the inferior colliculus of young-adult, anesthetized C57/Bl6 mice to compare the responses to constant-current injections with the responses to tones of different duration or to sinusoidal amplitude-modulated (SAM) tones. We observed that voltage-dependent ion channels contributed in several ways to the response to tones. A sustained response to long tones was observed only in cells showing little accommodation during current injection. Cells showing burst-onset firing during current injection showed a small response to SAM tones, whereas burst-sustained cells showed a good response to SAM tones. The hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation channel I(h) had a special role in shaping the responses: I(h) was associated with an increased excitability, with chopper and pauser responses, and with an afterhyperpolarization following tones. Synaptic properties were more important in determining the responses to tones of different durations. A short-latency inhibitory response appeared to contribute to the long-pass response in some cells and short-pass and band-pass neurons were characterized by their slow recovery from synaptic adaptation. Cells that recovered slowly from synaptic adaptation showed a relatively small response to SAM tones. Our results show an important role for both intrinsic membrane properties -- most notably the presence of I(h) and the extent of accommodation -- and synaptic adaptation in shaping the response to tones in the inferior colliculus.",Excluded

We theoretically analyze all-optical switching in the recently characterized LOV2 domain from Avena sativa (oat) phot1 phototropin, a blue-light plant photoreceptor, based on nonlinear intensity-induced excited-state absorption. The transmission of a cw probe laser beam at 660 nm corresponding to the peak absorption of the first excited L-state, through the LOV2 sample, is switched by a pulsed pump laser beam at 442 nm that corresponds to the maximum initial D state absorption. The switching characteristics have been analyzed using the rate equation approach, considering all the three intermediate states and transitions in the LOV2 photocycle. It is shown that for a given pump pulse intensity, there is an optimum pump pulsewidth for which the switching contrast is maximum. It is shown that the probe laser beam can be completely switched off (100% modulation) by the pump laser beam at 50 kW/cm2 for a concentration of 1 mM with sample thickness of 5.5 mm. The switching characteristics are sensitive to various parameters such as concentration, rate constant of L-state, peak pump intensity and pump pulse width. At typical values, the switch-off and switch-on time is 1.6 and 22.3 micros, respectively. The switching characteristics have also been used to design all-optical NOT and the universal NOR and NAND logic gates.",Excluded
3760,"Assembly of actin-containing cortex occurs at distal regions of growing neurites in PC12 cells. Although actin filaments are known to be localized in the cortex of axons and in the growth cones of nerve cells, it is unclear how actin-containing structures are assembled during nerve growth. We have studied the formation of actin structures in growing neurites by microinjecting fluorescent phalloidin or actin into PC12 neuron-like cells to label endogenous actin filaments. Upon stimulation of neurite growth in cells microinjected with fluorescent phalloidin, little or no fluorescence was detected in nascent growth cones and adjacent neurites despite the presence of actin filaments in these regions, suggesting that actin filaments were primarily formed by de novo assembly rather than the transport and reorganization of pre-existing, phalloidin-labeled actin filaments. Time-lapse observations of the distribution of phalloidin-labeled actin filaments during neurite elongation confirmed that fluorescence associated with pre-existing neurite cortex spread out more slowly than the elongation of neurites. Furthermore, when a dark spot was photobleached with a laser microbeam along neurites of cells microinjected with either fluorescent phalloidin or actin, the spot showed no appreciable translocation during active neurite elongation. Taken together, these results suggest that de novo assembly of actin filaments plays a crucial role in the formation of growth cones and adjacent cortex in the distal region of neurites, but does not appear to require the anterograde or retrograde transport of cortical filaments, or the passive stretching of the proximal segment of the neurite cortex.",Excluded
4268,"Atypical retardation patterns in scanning laser polarimetry are associated with low peripapillary choroidal thickness. PURPOSE: Scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) results can be affected by an atypical retardation pattern (ARP). One reason for an ARP is the birefringence of the sclera. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the peripapillary choroidal thickness (pChTh) on the occurrence of ARP.METHODS: One hundred ten healthy subjects were investigated with SLP and spectral domain OCT. pChTh was measured in B-scan images at 768 positions using semiautomatic software. Values were averaged to 32 sectors and the total peripapillary mean. Subjects were divided into four groups according to the typical scan score (TSS) provided by the GDxVCC: group 1 TSS, 100; group 2 TSS, 90-99; group 3 TSS, 80-89; group 4 TSS, <80.RESULTS: Mean pChTh (+/- SD) in 110 healthy subjects was 141 mum (+/-49 mum). There was a significant correlation between pChTh and TSS (r = 0.608; P < 0.001). In TSS groups 1 to 4, mean pChTh was 168 mum (+/-38 mum), 148 mum (+/- 48 mum), 119 mum (+/-35 mum), and 92 (+/-42 mum). Mean pChTh of TSS groups 3 and 4 was significantly lower than that of TSS group 1 (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Low values of TSS resulting from the appearance of ARP in SLP are associated with low peripapillary choroidal thickness. Reduced choroidal thickness may result in an increased amount of confounding light getting to the SLP light detectors.",Excluded

Little progress has been made in the treatment of small cell lung cancer over the past two decades. Superiority of combined irinotecan-cisplatin over standard etoposide-cisplatin in a Japanese phase III trial was not confirmed in two subsequent US studies. In this Practice Point we discuss a randomized, phase III trial by Hermes and colleagues, which included 220 patients with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer and showed superiority of carboplatin-irinotecan versus carboplatin-oral etoposide. In this trial, 47% of patients had a performance status >=3 and 35% were older than 70 years, which represents a typical clinical practice population of patients; however, oral administration of etoposide and an arbitrary dose reduction in elderly and unfit patients represent limitations of the study. A European trial of irinotecan-carboplatin versus intravenous etoposide-carboplatin has completed accrual and results will be analyzed in 2009. Although the results of the study by Hermes et al. are of interest, substitution of etoposide by irinotecan can not be recommended.",Excluded

Background: Central neurocytoma (CN) is a rare tumor accounting for <0.5% of all intracranial tumors. Surgery +/- radiotherapy is the mainstay treatment. This international multicentric study aims to evaluate the outcomes of CNs patients after multimodal therapies and identify predictive factors. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively identified 33 patients with CN treated between 2005 and 2019. Treatment characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Result(s): All patients with CN underwent surgical resection. Radiotherapy was delivered in 19 patients. The median radiation dose was 54 Gy (range, 50-60 Gy). The median follow-up time was 56 months. The 5-year OS and 5-year PFS were 90% and 76%, respectively. Patients who received radiotherapy had a significantly longer PFS than patients without RT (p = 0.004) and a trend towards longer OS. In addition, complete response after treatments was associated with longer PFS (p = 0.07).

The aim of this work focuses on the description of the short-term response of a 9L brain tumor model and its vasculature to microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Rat 9L gliosarcomas implanted in nude mice brains were irradiated by MRT 13 days after tumor inoculation using two orthogonal arrays of equally spaced 28 planar microbeams (25 microm width, 211 microm spacing and dose 500 Gy). At 1, 7 and 14 days after MRT, apparent diffusion coefficient, blood volume and vessel size index were mapped by MRI. Mean survival time after tumor inoculation increased significantly between MRT-treated and untreated groups (23 and 28 days respectively, log-rank test, p < 0.0001). A significant increase of apparent diffusion coefficient was observed 24 h after MRT in irradiated tumors versus non-irradiated ones. In the untreated group, both tumor size and vessel size index increased significantly (from 7.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.2 +/- 4.0 mm(2) and +23%, respectively) between the 14th and the 21st day after tumor cell inoculation. During the same period, in the MRT-treated group, no difference in tumor size was observed. The vessel size index measured in the MRT-treated group increased significantly (+26%) between 14 and 28 days of tumor growth. We did not observe the significant difference in blood volume between the MRT-treated and untreated groups. MRT slows 9L tumor growth in a mouse brain but MRI results suggest that the increase in survival time after our MRT approach may be rather due to a cytoreduction than to early direct effects of ionizing radiation on tumor vessels. These results suggest that MRT parameters need to be optimized to further damage tumor vessels.",Excluded
3883,"Direct oral anticoagulants in patients with cancer. Introduction Cancer patients are at high risk for morbidity and mortality due to thrombosis and bleeding, in addition they may also have pre-existing conditions, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and prior venous thromboembolism (VTE), for which chronic anticoagulation may be indicated. Historically, warfarin was the most commonly prescribed anticoagulant for stroke prevention in AF patients. Since 2010, the US FDA has approved 4 alternative direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) - dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF. There is limited literature to support the use of DOACs in cancer patients, but they are being prescribed by medical professionals nonetheless. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the DOACs in cancer patients, to quantify their bleeding risks, and to identify patients that are more likely to benefit from these new medications in comparison to warfarin. Large randomized clinical trials of DOACs compared to warfarin in cancer patients have not been performed. Our aim was to determine the effectiveness and associated risk of DOACs vs. warfarin in a large, real-world population of cancer patients with AF. Methods We identified 532,743 AF patients initiating oral anticoagulant use in 2010-2014 continuously enrolled in MarketScan databases. We selected 41,036 cancer patients with inpatient or outpatient ICD9 code 140.x-172.x and 174.x-209.x (excluded 173.x, non-melanoma skin cancer), and then identified a subset of cancer patients being actively treated at the time of anticoagulant initiation. Active cancer patients were defined by the use of chemotherapy, radiation therapy or cancer surgery within 6 months prior to the start of anticoagulation. Patients were categorized according to the first anticoagulant prescribed after AF diagnosis. DOAC users were matched with warfarin users by age (+/-3 years), sex, enrollment date (90 days), and anticoagulant initiation date (90 days). Study endpoints, including ischemic stroke, severe bleeding (intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding), other bleeding (genitourinary bleeding, hemopericardium, hemarthrosis, epistaxis, hemoptysis and unspecified hemorrhage) and VTE were identified using inpatient diagnostic codes, and VTE was additionally identified from 2 outpatient diagnostic codes within the same year. Cox proportional hazards models were used to access the association between type of anticoagulant and outcomes adjusting for high-dimensional propensity score, age, sex, CHA DS -VASc score, and the prevalent outcome. Results The demographic profile of the patients included in the analysis are depicted in Table 1, and Table 2 summarizes the outcomes data. In this analysis there were 6,075 cancer patients with AF who were on DOACs (rivaroxaban 2808, dabigatran 2189, and apixaban 1078) compared to 10,021 on warfarin, with a mean age of 74 years, and a mean follow-up time of 1 year. Approximately 40% of the patients were woman, and breast cancer was the most common cancer in each cohort. We found that for rivaroxaban and dabigatran users, the adjusted hazard ratios for severe bleeding was non significantly different to warfarin users, however, apixaban users had a lower risk of severe bleeding compared to warfarin users, with a hazard ratio 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.79, p=0.01). The risk of other bleeding was lower in dabigatran users compared to warfarin users with a hazard ratio 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.41-0.84, p=0.003). The risk of ischemic stroke did not differ significantly amongst different anticoagulant users. Each of the DOACs was superior to warfarin in lowering the risk of incident VTE, with p values < 0.0001. Conclusion Based on this analysis the DOACs seem to be well tolerated in cancer patients in regard to the management of atrial fibrillation, with lower or similar rates of bleeding and stroke compared to warfarin users. Importantly, the DOAC users had a significantly lower risk of incident VTE. Given that VTE ev nts contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, prescription of DOACs in place of warfarin can be considered in cancer patients with AF, while we are awaiting prospective data from randomized trials.

BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy remains the standard of treatment for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study is to determine if the deferral of brain radiotherapy impacts patient outcomes.METHODS: Between May 2003 and December 2015, a total of 198 patients with brain metastases from NSCLC who received both brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) were identified. The rate of grade 3-4 adverse reactions related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy had no significant difference between two groups. 127 patients received concurrent brain radiotherapy and systemic therapy, and 71 patients received deferred brain radiotherapy after at least two cycles of chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Disease specific-graded prognostic assessment was similar in early radiotherapy group and deferred radiotherapy group.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was longer in early radiotherapy group compared to deferred radiotherapy group (17.9 months vs 12.6 months; P=0.038). Progression free survival (PFS) was also improved in patients receiving early radiotherapy compared to those receiving deferred radiotherapy (4.0 months vs 3.0 months; P<0.01). Receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after the diagnosis of brain metastases as any line therapy improved the OS (20.0 months vs 10.7 months; P<0.01), whereas receiving TKI as first line therapy did not (17.9 months vs 15.2 months; P=0.289).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the use of deferred brain radiotherapy may resulted in inferior OS in patients with NSCLC who develop brain metastases.

Our purpose was to quantify the sparing of the hair bearing skin that could be achieved by using a complex hair-sparing approach. To achieve this goal, we treat an anthropomorphic phantom with both conventional and inverse-planned intensity-modulated portals.

The average measured dose at five surface points was reduced by 53% - from 95% of the prescription dose with the conventional plan, to 44%, with the IMRT plan. This sparing was achieved while maintaining adequate target coverage. Because of the low radiation tolerance of the hair follicle, this dose reduction is not expected, on its own, to eliminate radiation alopecia but bears promise in combination with other toxicity-sparing strategies. ©Adenine Press (2005).",Excluded
4120,"Re-irradiation with hypo-fractionated stereotactic robotic radiotherapy for salvage in adult patients with brainstem glioma. PURPOSE: Brainstem glioma (BSG) is often treated with definitive irradiation. However, subsequent progression and death occur as a rule rather than the exception, after varying periods of control. The outlook of patients with post-irradiation progression is dismal, and most of these patients are treated with supportive care alone. Despite the obvious risks with an area as critical as the brainstem, it is a possibility to encounter situations wherein the patients (themselves or their associates) ask for re-irradiation, with the hope of a few extra months of life. The risk of radiation-induced brainstem toxicity may be justifiable under the strict assumption that the patients stand a chance of benefiting from re-irradiation but still may not live long enough to manifest brainstem toxicity.METHODS: Five adult BSG patients were treated with re-irradiation using robotic-arm stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) between September 2009 and July 2012, primarily at the request of the concerned patient parties. Re-irradiation doses ranged from 16 to 25 Gray (Gy) delivered by robotic arm stereotactic irradiation in 2-5 fractions.RESULTS: Four out of five patients enjoyed a prolongation of survival in the order of months (three, five, six, and 14 months), which was very significant given that all patients had severe neurological compromise and poor performance status prior to re-irradiation. One patient has survived 36 months after re-irradiation and thus has lived long enough to manifest late radiation-induced brainstem toxicity.CONCLUSION: Despite the obvious risks of brainstem toxicity associated with the use of re-irradiation for BSG, the use of fractionated stereotactic re-irradiation seems to offers prospects of additional periods of local control and augments duration of life.",Excluded
4055,"Modulations of nerve growth factor and Bcl-2 in ultraviolet-irradiated human epidermis. BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to the skin causes apoptosis of keratinocytes. Melanocytes are more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis, due, in part, to high levels of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2. In vitro studies have shown that nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophic polypeptide, is produced by keratinocytes and exerts a protective role for melanocytes by upregulating Bcl-2. The purpose of this study was to determine NGF and Bcl-2 modulations in UV-irradiated human skin.METHODS: Nine volunteers were irradiated with two minimal erythema doses using solar-simulated UV irradiation. Seventy-two hours post irradiation, skin biopsies were obtained from irradiated and sun-protected skin. The skin specimens were stained with anti-tyrosinase-related protein-1 monoclonal antibody IgG2a (Mel-5), anti-Bcl-2 (monoclonal antibody IgG-kappa), and with anti-NGF (polyclonal antibody IgG).RESULTS: NGF staining was identified within the cytoplasm of epidermal melanocytes, similar to the staining observed for TRP-1 and Bcl-2. While no significant difference in the number of TRP-1- and Bcl-2-positive melanocytes was observed between irradiated and non-irradiated skin within 72 h, the number of NGF-positive melanocytes decreased significantly, 72 h after UV irradiation (p < 0.024). NGF was also identified within keratinocytes, and while non-irradiated skin exhibited cytoplasmic NGF staining throughout the epidermis, NGF staining was reduced in the lower epidermal layers after UV irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first in vivo study showing NGF to be present in melanocytes, as well as showing modulations of NGF and Bcl-2 in melanocytes, following solar-simulated UV irradiation.",Excluded
4612,"Acoustic neuromas: Evaluation of outcomes and toxicity with the use of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Purpose/Objective: A number of different therapeutic strategies are commonly used to treat acoustic neuromas including gamma knife radiosurgery, linear accelerator based radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Our centre treats patients with a fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy regime of 52.5 Gray in 25 fractions. Outcomes and toxicities of patients treated with this regime from 1995 to 2010 are presented here. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review of all the available electronic case notes, as well as imaging reports for patients treated for acoustic neuroma, were conducted. RECIST criteria were used to assess response on imaging and treatment outcomes, and were analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Toxicity assessments were also conducted. Radiotherapy methods include immobilisation in a non-invasive relocatable Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame with stereotactic head ring. A depth helmet was also used to ensure and verify reproducibility and a maximum tolerance of 2 mm was permitted. For tumour localisation and organs at risk (OAR) delineation a planning CT scan of the head was performed with the stereotactic head ring in place using 2 mm slices. CT images were transferred to the X knife radiotherapy planning computer system via the DICOM network for automatic external contouring, clinician contouring of target volume and OAR, followed by dose planning. After 2001 diagnostic 2mm stealth MRI scans were co-registered with the planning CT scan to allow more accurate delineation of target volume and OAR. Most patients were treated with an average of 3 non-coplanar arcs, with each arc having an equal collimator size which tended to be about 3 cm. This therefore produced a spherical shaped dose distribution. The choice of collimator size and arrangement of arcs depended on the size of tumour and location in relationship to the OAR, in particular the brainstem. A single iso-centre was chosen and the radiation dose was usually prescribed to 100% at the iso-centre using 6 MV photons. Result(s): 93 patients were identified of which 83 patients were available for follow-up with a median period of 5.7 years. Overall control rate using RECIST criteria was 92% (Fig 1). Toxicity data were available for 90 patients with 6 (7%) experiencing a reduction in hearing, 1 (1%) had a deterioration in their trigeminal nerve function and 1 (1%) had a deterioration in facial nerve function (Table 1). 4 (4%) patients developed hydrocephalus, requiring the placement of a shunt and 1 (1%) patient developed radiation brainstem necrosis. After further evaluation this patient was deemed to have been treated within acceptable dose constraints. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): This data suggests that a good control rate of acoustic neuromas is achievable using fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to a dose of 52.5 Gray in 25 fractions.

3683,"Evidence-based modelling of optimal CT simulation appointment length. Background: The length of CT Simulation appointments impacts access to radiotherapy services; longer appointment lengths can result in decreased capacity for patient simulation. Aim(s): To develop evidence-based guidelines for CT simulation appointment length to increase capacity and improve access to radiotherapy clinical resources. Method(s): Phase 1 was a retrospective chart review of 60 patients selected in reverse chronological order from the CT simulation schedule for the following radiotherapy techniques: Breast tangent, CNS (brain and spine) IMRT and SBRT, Lung (including mesothelioma) IMRT and SBRT, Liver IMRT, Upper GI IMRT, Lymphoma mantle and Total Body Irradiation (TBI), and Head and Neck (H&N) IMRT. The duration of the CT simulation procedure was measured for each patient as the difference between the first and last time stamps in the radiation therapy electronic medical record. In Phase 2 an additional 5 minutes was added to each appointment length in Phase 1 to account for routine patient care activities (e.g. patient education) extending beyond the documented time stamps. Evidence-based appointment lengths for each technique were averaged, peer reviewed, and validated by CT simulation radiation therapist specialists. Current appointment lengths were matched to the evidence-based appointment lengths. Result(s): Liver, Lymphoma TBI, CNS spine SBRT, Lung SBRT and Mesothelioma evidence-based appointment lengths (45 min) were 25% less than current appointment lengths (60 min). Breast, CNS brain, Lung, Upper GI and H&N evidence-based appointment lengths (20 min) were 33% less than current appointment lengths (30 min). Implementation of the evidencebased appointment lengths at an academic cancer centre with 4 CT simulators resulted in an overall net gain of 2880 minutes (equivalent to 96 30 minute appointments) of CT simulation time per month.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has rapidly become a major diagnostic technique, displacing computed tomography (CT) as the primary neuroimaging modality in many disorders of the central nervous system. Neuroimaging studies are valuable in the diagnosis and management of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. This article reviews the technique of MRI and its role in identifying the characteristic central nervous system manifestations of these neurocutaneous syndromes.OBSERVATIONS: MRI offers superior soft-tissue contrast without the use of ionizing radiation. It provides more detailed imaging than CT of the characteristic central nervous system lesions of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome. In neurofibromatosis type 1, these include optic glioma, astrocytoma, and plexiform neurofibroma, and ""unidentified bright objects"" that are seen only with MRI. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 2. Subependymal nodules and cortical and white matter tubers are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis. Manifestations of Sturge-Weber syndrome include leptomeningeal angiomatosis, hemiatrophy, cortical calcification, and patchy parenchymal gliosis and demyelination.CONCLUSIONS: MRI, especially with gadolinium enhancement, appears to be more sensitive than CT in the detection of neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber syndrome.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcomes for patients with Grade III meningiomas as defined by the 2007 World Health Organization standards.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The slides from patients who had been treated at the Cleveland Clinic for malignant meningiomas were reviewed by a single neuropathologist. The data from 13 patients treated between 1984 and 2006 satisfied the World Health Organization 2007 definition of Grade III meningioma. A total of 24 surgeries were performed, including 13 primary, 7 salvage, and 4 second salvage. Also, 14 courses of radiotherapy (RT) were administered, including fractionated RT in 3 patients after primary surgery, fractionated RT in 4 patients after salvage surgery, salvage stereotactic radiosurgery to six separate areas in 3 patients, and salvage intensity-modulated RT in 1 patient.RESULTS: From the primary surgery, the median survival was 3.4 years, the 5-year survival rate was 47.2%, and the 8-year survival rate was 12.2%. The median time to recurrence was 9.6 months. A trend was seen toward longer survival for patients who had received adjuvant RT after initial surgery compared with those treated with surgery alone. Two patients developed radiation necrosis, and three had surgical complications.CONCLUSION: This is one of the few studies reporting the outcomes for malignant meningioma patients according to recent definitions. Our results are consistent with existing reports of the overall poor outcomes for atypical and malignant meningioma patients. From the available data, surgical resection followed by RT and salvage therapy can lead to extended survival.",Excluded

4346,"Robustness of neural coding in Drosophila photoreceptors in the absence of slow delayed rectifier K+ channels. Determining the contribution of a single type of ion channel to information processing within a neuron requires not only knowledge of the properties of the channel but also understanding of its function within a complex system. We studied the contribution of slow delayed rectifier K+ channels to neural coding in Drosophila photoreceptors by combining genetic and electrophysiological approaches with biophysical modeling. We show that the Shab gene encodes the slow delayed rectifier K+ channel and identify a novel voltage-gated K+ conductance. Analysis of the in vivo recorded voltage responses together with their computer-simulated counterparts demonstrates that Shab channels in Drosophila photoreceptors attenuate the light-induced depolarization and prevent response saturation in bright light. We also show that reduction of the Shab conductance in mutant photoreceptors is accompanied by a proportional drop in their input resistance. This reduction in input resistance partially restores the signaling range, sensitivity, and dynamic coding of light intensities of Shab photoreceptors to those of the wild-type counterparts. However, loss of the Shab channels may affect both the energy efficiency of coding and the processing of natural stimuli. Our results highlight the role of different types of voltage-gated K+ channels in the performance of the photoreceptors and provide insight into functional robustness against the perturbation of specific ion channel composition.",Excluded

Aim: In Lu-177-DOTATATE PRRT the estimation of dosimetric values for tumours and radiation sensitive organs such as the kidneys supports individualized therapies. For this purpose a volume-of-interest (VOI) for each entity has to be defined in image data, acquired at days 1, 2 and 3 p.i. We have studied a method to automatically segment tumour and kidney VOIs in 4D SPECT data compared to manually defined VOIs. Material(s) and Method(s): Three patients (mean 70.7y) with neuroendocrine tumours who received 7.4GBq of Lu-177 DOTATATE were imaged with a Dual-head SPECT/CT (Siemens Symbia T2) with 20s/step in 64 steps/head. The CT image taken at day 1 was coregistered to each SPECT dataset and utilized for attenuation correction in penalized OSEM reconstruction employing compensation for distance dependent detector blur and photon scatter. The three SPECT volumes were synthesized to form a 4D SPECT study. A robust k-means cluster algorithm was used to automatically detect eight clusters in these dynamic image data, followed by a labeller to segment each individual connected VOI. For comparison, three to five tumours and two kidney VOIs were manually defined for each patient and an auto contour at the 40% of maximum value was applied. Based on the mean time-activity curves of each selected VOI a 3D dose map was calculated using S-value convolution kernels (Monte Carlo simulation in soft tissue). Result(s): The automatic segmentation successfully found 11 out of 12 tumour VOIs and three out of six kidney cortex VOIs. The missed entities can be addressed to overlapping with surrounding high-activity VOIs, mainly tumours and spleen. The mean dose values of the 11 tumours were 17.2+/-9.1Gy with the automatic and 16.5+/-9.1Gy with the manual method. The estimated dose to the cortex of the three successfully segmented kidneys was 9.7+/-1.7Gy with the automatic and 8.7+/-1.1Gy with the manual method. We found a strong correlation (rho=0.8) and no significant difference (paired t-test) between the dose estimates of both methods. Conclusion(s): The automatic segmentation is a promising approach to reduce the effort to generate dose estimates in PRRT. Nevertheless we observed that the position of kidneys can significantly change between measurement days, hindering an accurate coregistration on the voxel or organ boundary level. These misregistered boundaries can result in false segmentation and dosimetric results. Furthermore the inclusion of structural information such as the CT image into the automatic segmentation algorithm could be a promising improvement.",Excluded
4462,"An assessment of methods for monitoring entrance surface dose in fluoroscopically guided interventional proceduces. In the light of a growing awareness of the risks of inducing skin injuries as a consequence of fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures (FGIPs), this paper reports measurements of ESDs made during the period August 1998 to June 1999 on 137 patients undergoing cardiac, neurological and general FGIPs in the South London area. In addition, different methods suitable for use in a routine monitoring programme of ESD are discussed. Although the need for additional data is acknowledged, the results reported reinforce the need for routine assessments to be made of ESDs in FGIPs. At present, the most reliable and accurate form of ESD measurement would seem to be arrays of TLDs. However, transducer based methods although likely to be less accurate, have considerable advantages in relation to a continuous monitoring programme. It is also suggested that there may be the potential locally for threshold dose area product (DAP) values to be set for specific procedures. These could be used to provide early warning of the potential for skin injuries.",Excluded
4591,"Tractography to visualise the relationship of the optic radiation to epileptogenic lesions prior to neurosurgery. Background A third of patients with epilepsy are refractory to medical treatment and may be amenable to surgery. A major concern is to avoid causing new deficits. As conventional MR imaging does not delineate the optic radiation, the risk to vision from surgery cannot be predicted, nor can surgery be tailored to minimise the risk. Methods Conventional structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired in 13 patients with medically refractory epilepsy due a lesion near the optic radiation and undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. The optic radiation was delineated and visualised in relation to the lesions on anatomical images and in 3D reconstructions. Pre- and post-operative visual fields were acquired by Goldmann perimetry. Results The relationship between the epileptogenic lesion and the optic radiation was demonstrated in each patient provididing helpful additional information in deciding whether to proceed with surgery, and in planning the surgical procedure and approach. Prseoperative and postoperative imaging findings correlated with the visual field data. Conclusion The optic radiation shows significant anatomical variability, but can be reliably delineated by tractography. As surgical disruption of the optic radiation has serious consequences for the patient, DTI tractography proves a useful technique in this population. Future integration with real-time neuronavigation will inimise the risks of neurosurgery.",Excluded

The Elekta Synergy S with dissociated simultaneous multiple port (dose islands) within a single field. This simultaneous-treatment technique enables us to more efficiently treat two lesions concurrently when each target conforms to the radiosurgery protocol. Materials/Methods:We created a clinical reference plan (CRP), which has optimized dose coverage, conformity, homogeneity, and step-wise fall-off to zero dose.We then applied orthogonal-to-spherical coordinate system transformations about the isocenter, to each individual beam's parameters that simulated the multiple rotational errors for this research. For each patient (n = 10) 24 experimental treatment plan (ETP) calculations were. For each ETP , DVHs were computed for the two PTVs, optic nerves, optic chiasm and brainstem. From all of the DVH data, critical analytical indices were computed and compared to the CRP. These analytical indices include: Coverage, conformity, Dose Homogeneity, and Dose Gradient. A neurosurgical team evaluated the plans and subjectively evaluated the clinical suitability of each plan. The accumulated indices were scored and weighted to obtain a single value, the Unified Dosimetry Index (UDI). The UDI represents a plan's suitability vis-a-vis the CRP. Result(s): From the computed UDIs we observed that ETPs with 1-2 degrees of rotation remain within the defined range of suitability for clinical treatment. Rotation errors greater than 2 degrees resulted in UDI outside the clinically acceptable range. Conclusion(s): Isocenter rotations of 3 degrees or more significantly reduces the quality of clinical SRS treatments. Small lesions are especially vulnerable to loss of dosimetric coverage. SRS treatment setup should have a combined rotational error less than 2.5 degrees to effectively deliver the prescribed radiation dose using multiple brain lesions with mono-isocentric technique.",Excluded

A 41-year-old woman (case 1) and a 65-year-old man (case 2), both presented with two metastatic brain lesions, one in each hemisphere. The third case was a 65-year-old woman with multiple recurrent atypical meningiomas, who underwent surgical removal in two stages. In the first surgery, only the superior sagittal sinus lesion was excised. Then in the second surgery, multiple disseminated bilateral convexity tumors were excised through a craniotomy on each side. All cases had a remarkable neurological improvement immediately after surgery. We suggest that the indications for surgical removal of multiple brain tumors with two or more craniotomies in the same surgical session are: 1) progressing neurological symptoms, 2) tumors with a maximum diameter more than 2 cm, 3) resistance to radiation and/or chemotherapy, 4) ability to tolerate the scheduled surgical time, 5) vital prognosis anticipated to be more than 3 months, 6) expectation of significant neurological improvement, and 7) single-session surgery not carrying more risk than multiple surgeries.",Excluded
3731,"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) presenting as solitary CNS lymphoma: A rare occurrence. Introduction: PTLD associated lymphoma is the second most common malignancy in patients receiving SOT or HSCT with an incidence rate of 1%-3%. PCNS-PTLD occurs in 7%-15% of all PTLD cases. We present a case of isolated PCNS lymphoma two years after renal transplant. Case Description: A 57 year old woman with PMH of ESRD s/p kidney transplant (D/EBV -,R/ EBV +) with chronic CrCl of 30-40% presented with paresthesia and numbness over the right side of her body with mild ataxia 2 years post transplant. Physical exam revealed only numbness over the right side of body. MRI with contrast revealed a left thalamic lesion with moderate vasogenic edema, and MR spectroscopy confirmed high grade neoplasm involving left thalamus. Stereotactic biopsy showed polymorphic CD-20 and EBV positive PTLD. EBV PCR were elevated. Further evaluation ruled out systemic PTLD. Myfortic was stopped and oral steroids started with mild improvement in symptoms. Choice of systemic chemotherapy was limited due to reduced CrCl and risks of graft failure. She received modified regimen with renally adjusted high dose Methotrexate, Vincristine and Rituximab for 6 cycles with partial remission and then Temozolomide for 7 cycles with complete remission. Discussion(s): The incidence of PTLD ranges from 1 to 25% with 90% of cases being EBV-associated, CD20 positive, B cell neoplasms. PCNS-PTLD has a higher incidence in renal SOT, occurs late and is usually monomorphic unlike our patient. Median time of occurrence is 4-5 years after transplant. Risk factors include age, intensity of immunosuppression, time to transplant and EBV status of donor and recipient. Common presenting features include neurological deficits, seizure, and raised intracranial pressure. MRI is the preferred imaging and shows multifocal, ill defined, ring enhancing lesions usually in supratentorial and lobar regions. Positive CSF EBV PCR is highly suggestive but biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment modalities include reduction of immunosuppression, rituximab, high dose methotrexate, cytarabine and cranial radiotherapy. Use of high dose methotrexate has shown improved outcomes with median survival of 26-47 months. Lack of response to first line therapy is considered the dominant prognostic factor.

3740,"Annual rate of hearing loss falls after fractionated stereotactic irradiation for vestibular schwannoma. PURPOSE: The rate of hearing loss in a population before and after irradiation was investigated to determine the effect of irradiation on hearing impairment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 72 patients with vestibular schwannoma who received fractionated stereotactic irradiation from 1992 to 1999, 21 had had their hearing levels examined 3 months or more before the treatment. The mean time between the initial examination and treatment was 18.6 months (range: 3-89 months), and the mean time between treatment and the last follow-up was 24.2 months (12-69 months). Thirty-six to 50 Gy in 20-25 fractions over 5 to 6 weeks was given using an X-ray beam from a linear accelerator. Pure tone average (PTA) was measured using the mean hearing level at five frequencies, and the annual rate of hearing loss was defined as [(hearing loss in PTA(dB))/(follow-up period (months)x12)].RESULTS: The actual cumulative curve of decrease in tumor size of 2 mm or more was 38.3% at 2 years and 80.0% at 3 years. The mean of hearing loss in PTA was 11.6+/-10.3 dB (-1 to 35 dB) from the initial examination to the start of irradiation and 11.9+/-14.4 dB (-14 to 37 dB) from the start of irradiation to the last follow-up. The mean annual rates of hearing loss before irradiation and in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th years after irradiation were, respectively, 18.6, 11.2, 6.2, 5.1, and 5.0 dB/year. The annual rates of hearing loss in the 2nd year (P=0.025) and 3rd year (P=0.018) were significantly slower than the rate before irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: The mean annual rate of hearing loss was higher before irradiation than after irradiation, and hearing loss slowed rather than accelerated after irradiation. Although hearing loss after the treatment was usually permanent, fractionated stereotactic irradiation was suggested to be effective to lower the rate of hearing loss.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of automated tube voltage selection (ATVS) on radiation dose at computed tomography (CT) worldwide encompassing all body regions and types of CT examinations.MATERIALS AND METHODS: No patient information was accessed; therefore, institutional review board approval was not sought. Data from 86 centers across the world were analyzed. All CT interactions were automatically collected and transmitted to the CT vendor during two 6-week periods immediately before and 2 weeks after implementation of ATVS. A total of 164 323 unique CT studies were analyzed. Studies were categorized by body region and type of examination. Tube voltage and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) were compared between examinations performed with ATVS and those performed before ATVS implementation. Descriptive statistical methods and multilevel linear regression models were used for analysis.RESULTS: Across all types of CT examinations and body regions, CTDIvol was 14.7% lower in examinations performed with ATVS (n = 30 313) than in those performed before ATVS implementation (n = 79 275). Relative reductions in mean CTDIvol were most notable for temporal bone CT (-56.1%), peripheral runoff CT angiography (-48.6%), CT of the paranasal sinus (-39.6%), cerebral or carotid CT angiography (-36.4%), coronary CT angiography (-25.1%), and head CT (-23.9%).

4757,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ameliorates recognition memory impairment induced by hindlimb unloading in mice associated with BDNF/TrkB signaling. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which could improve learning and memory, is widely used in psychiatry and neurology as a therapeutic approach. There are few studies reporting effective countermeasures to cognition decline in astronauts during space flight. Accordingly, we examined whether rTMS was able to significantly alleviate the learning and memory deficits induced by hindlimb unloading (HU), a general accepted rodent model to simulate microgravity, in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: Sham, rTMS, HU, and HU+rTMS groups. The hindlimb unloading procedure continued for consecutive 14 days. Meanwhile, high frequency rTMS (15Hz) was applied for 14 days from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of HU procedure. The novel object recognition test showed that the recognition memory was evidently impaired in the HU group compared to that in the Sham group, however, rTMS significantly attenuated the impairment of the memory. Furthermore, rTMS significantly improved the HU-induced LTP impairment and increased spine density in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region. Additionally, rTMS enhanced the expressions of postsynaptic function-associated proteins N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NR2B and NR2A) and postsynaptic density protein (PSD95), upregulated BDNF/TrkB signaling and increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) in the HU+rTMS group.

We experienced a patient with photosensitive attacks induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Method(s): A 60-year-old man presented to our hospital because he experienced photosensitive attacks, which first occurred 3 months previously. In the case of our patient, sunlight always induced a photosensitive attack, during which he was blinded for approximately 10 minutes. He did not experience convulsions, loss of consciousness, headache, and symptoms of amaurosis. Ophthalmological examination, electroencephalography, and brain computed tomography (CT) did not indicate any abnormal findings. The patient was exposed to cervical radiation for pharyngeal cancer approximately 16 years previously. He did not have migraine, diabetes, and any previous cerebrovascular disease. The patient had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which were not treated appropriately. Result(s): One month after visiting our hospital, he experienced transient ischemic attacks (TIA) with right hemiparesis. Thereafter, the patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed small cerebral infarctions. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed no abnormalities; however, ultrasound of the carotid artery showed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). Cerebral angiography also showed bilateral ICA stenosis (approximately 90%). A 99m-Technetium- ECD single-photon emission CT scan revealed low bilateral occipital perfusion. Because the bilateral ICA stenosis was induced by radiation, we decided to perform carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) instead of carotid endarterectomy.

Although the therapeutic action of antidepressants most likely involves the regulation of serotonergic and noradrenergic signal transduction, no consensus has been reached concerning their precise molecular or cellular mechanisms of action. In the present study, we demonstrated that chronic treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant (imipramine) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (sertraline) reduced the expression of Ndrg2 mRNA and protein in the rat frontal cortex. Ndrg2 is a member of the N-Myc downstream-regulated genes. Interestingly, repeated ECT also significantly decreased Ndrg2 expression in this region of the brain. These data suggest that Ndrg2 may be a common functional molecule that is decreased after antidepressant treatment and ECT. Although, the functional role of Ndrg2 in the central nervous system remains unclear, our findings suggest that Ndrg2 may be associated with treatment-induced adaptive neural plasticity in the brain, a chronic target of antidepressant action. In conclusion, we have identified Ndrg2 as a candidate target molecule of antidepressants and ECT.",Excluded

4156,"Mechanisms of caspase-1 mediated schwannoma regression. Schwannoma tumors are composed of Schwann-lineage cells and form along peripheral, spinal and cranial nerves. These tumors can cause pain, sensory/motor dysfunction, and death through compression of peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, and/or the brain stem. We have previously shown gene therapy for these tumors using a xenograft model in which immortalized human schwannoma cells (HEI-193) expressing a fluorescent protein and luciferase are implanted in the sciatic nerve of nude mice. Our strategy has been to express the apoptotic protein, caspase-1 (ICE, IL1-converting enzyme) under the P0 promoter, selectively active in Schwann cells during development, using an adeno-associated vector 1 (AAV1) injected directly into the tumors. Caspase-3 is the most common pro-apoptotic target for therapeutic modulation. However, unlike caspase-3, caspase-1 has a strong pro-inflammatory component in addition to induction of apoptosis. Caspase-1 activates pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18, which in turn trigger immune responses mediated by neutrophils and monocytes, or NK cells; it has been associated with both innate and adaptive immunity. In addition, caspase-1 is activated by several chemotherapeutic drugs and can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation. Our recent data indicate that AAV1- P0-ICE not only induces apoptosis of infected caspase-1-expressing HEI-193 schwannoma cells, but also kills non-infected tumor cells through a bystander effect mediated by both tumor- and host-specific mechanisms. Supernatants derived from HEI-193 cells transfected with AAV1-P0-ICE DNA kill non-transfected tumor cells in vitro. Similarly, peripheral nerve implantation of a 1:1 mixture of AAV-P0- ICE DNA-transfected and non-transfected HEI-193 cells prevented tumor growth. This bystander killing effect induced by AAV1-P0-ICE was also observed when established intra-sciatic HEI-193 tumors were injected with AAV1-P0-ICE transfected cells. Interestingly, intra-sciatic implantation of HEI-193 cells 2 weeks after injection at the same location of AAV1-P0-ICE DNA-transfected cells, i.e. long after all of the originally implanted caspase-1expressing HEI-193 cells should be dead, also prevents formation of a tumor. These data suggest that caspase-1-induced death of HEI-193 cells in vivo leads to local changes in the region of the tumor capable of preventing formation of a subsequent tumor. This investigation of AAV1-P0-ICE induced bystander killing of tumor cells has the potential to generate new therapeutics for the neurofibromatoses, as well as, for other benign neoplasms. Not only can caspase-1 induce apoptosis, but the resulting tumor killing and associated activation of host immune responses may generate a vaccination effect that could control the development and growth of subsequent schwannomas.",Excluded

Due to an increasing concern about radiation-induced cognitive deficits for brain tumor patients receiving radiation therapy, developing and evaluating countermeasures has become inevitable. Our previous study has found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Thus, in the present study, we report an unknown mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of minocycline. We demonstrated that minocycline prevented primary neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis and promoted radiation-induced autophagy in vitro. Moreover, using an immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line, HT22 cells, we found that the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated HT22 cells was not related to DNA damage repair since minocycline did not facilitate DNA DSB repair in irradiated HT22 cells. Further investigation showed that minocycline significantly enhanced X-irradiation-induced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, thus resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, although the antioxidant potential of minocycline might contribute to its apoptosis-inhibitory effect, it was not involved in its enhancive effect on radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy. Taken together, we have revealed a novel mechanism for the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated neurons, e.g. minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis via enhancing radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included

We created new indices derived from conformity indices suggested by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG; mRTOG-CI) and Paddick et al. (mIP-CI), using the dosimetric parameters of the sum of the two PTVs. The median PTV was 5.05 cm3 (range, 2.10-28.47). VMAT significantly improved mRTOG-CI and mIP-CI compared with DCAT. In all cases, VMAT was able to improve mRTOG-CI and mIP-CI compared with DCAT. Whereas the normal brain volume receiving 5 Gy was similar between the two modalities, the normal brain receiving 10, 12, 15, 20, 25 and 28 Gy (V10-V28) was significantly smaller in VMAT. The mean beam-on times were 213.3 s and 121.9 s in DCAT and VMAT, respectively (P < 0.001). Mono-isocentric VMAT improved the target conformity and reduced the beam-on time and V10-V28 of the normal brain for not only two close metastases but also two distant metastases. Mono-isocentric VMAT seems to be a promising treatment technique for two large brain metastases.",Excluded
4024,"Efficacy in vivo of a cancer therapy strategy combining HSV1716 mediated oncolysis with gene transfer and targeted radiotherapy. Oncolytic herpes viruses have show promise for the treatment of cancer however it is unlikely that the optimal application of these viruses will be as single therapeutic agents. An alternative strategy would be to utilise these viruses to deliver therapeutic transgenes and enhance their tumour cell killing capacity. The herpes simplex virus-1 deletion mutant HSV1716 is a conditionally- replicating oncolytic virus. The safety of HSV1716 has been demonstrated in phase 1 clinical trails with no toxicity attributable to the virus in any patients and provided proof of principle that the virus is capable of directly destroying human tumour cells while leaving normal cells intact (1). To enhance its therapeutic potential, we have engineered HSV1716 to convey the noradrenaline transporter gene (NAT) and thus rendered transfected cells targetable with the radiopharmaceutical [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG. [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG is currently used in the treatment of NAT-expressing neuroblastoma, phaeochromocytoma and carcinoids. In this study we have utilised the recombinant virus HSV1716/NAT as a dual cell lysis / gene delivery vehicle for targeting of the NAT transgene to human tumour xenografts in vivo. We have shown that intra-tumoural or intra-venous injection of HSV1716/NAT induced the capacity for active uptake of intra-peritoneal administered [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in human glioma, melanoma and colorectal tumour xenograft models which do not express NAT. Tumour growth was significantly delayed after administration of HSV1716/NAT and [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG compared to treatment with either agents alone. However, the efficacy of combination treatment was dependent on the scheduling of delivery of the two agents. These findings support a role for combination radio-/gene therapy for cancer utilising HSV1716 expressing the NAT transgene and targeted radionuclide therapy.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: Unstable pelvic fractures are clinically complex injuries. Selecting appropriate treatment remains a challenging problem for orthopedic physicians. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effects of minimally invasive adjustable plate and locking compression plate in treatment of unstable pelvic fractures via posterior approach.METHODS: From January 2009 to June 2012, fifty-six patients with unstable pelvic fractures were included. After at least 12-month follow-up, forty-four patients treated with two methods were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: minimally invasive adjustable plate (group A) and locking compression plate (group B). Preoperative and postoperative radiography was taken to assess the fracture displacement and reduction quality. The size of incision, operation duration, blood loss, duration of X-ray exposures, Majeed postoperative functional evaluation and Lindahl postoperative reduction evaluation were analyzed.RESULTS: The mean follow-up in group A was 27.3 months (range, 13-48 months), and that in group B was 21.8 months (range, 12-42 months). There were no iatrogenic neurovascular injuries during the operations in the two groups. In group B, malunion was observed in one patient, and infection of incision was observed in one case. The operation duration, blood loss, and size of incision of group A were significantly less than that of group B. There was no significant difference in the duration of X-ray exposures between the two groups. The Majeed functional evaluation score in group A was significantly higher than that in group B. The difference of the imaging score of the retained displacement was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Both the two methods can effectively stabilize the unstable pelvic fractures. However, the minimally invasive adjustable plate has the advantages of minimally invasive, less radiation exposure, technically safe and time saving. Minimally invasive adjustable plate is a good supplementary option for treating posterior pelvic ring injuries.",Excluded
3864,"Resveratrol restores erectile function in irradiated rats: Role on SIRT-1 and nNOS protein expressions. INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of resveratrol (RVT), a well-known antioxidant agent, on oxidative parameters and erectile function in a rat model of pelvic irradiation. MATERIAL & METHODS: Fifty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups; control (C), radiation-early period (1 week) (Rd-E), radiation-late period (10 weeks) (Rd-L), Rd-E and resveratrol (Rd-E-RVT) and Rd-L and resveratrol treatment (Rd-L-RVT). Irradiation was performed based on the localized prostate cancer treatment protocol as a total of 20Gy. Resveratrol was given 10mg/kg orally 1 week for Rd-E-RVT group and 10 weeks for Rd-L-RVT. At the end of the experiment, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements were performed and rats were sacrificed for tissue collection. RESULT(S): Malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 activities were increased in both early and late irradiation groups as the latter being more elevated. Resveratrol treatment reversed these parameters back to control levels in both Rd- E-RVT and Rd-L-RVT groups. Glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in Rd-E and Rd-L groups and were reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment in both early and late periods. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities, cyclic GMP (c-GMP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were decreased in the early period of irradiation however this difference doesn't have statistical significance. These parameters were decreased significantly in Rd-L group and resveratrol treatment reversed these values back to control levels. Sirtuin-1 protein expression was similar in both Rd-E and Rd-E-RVT groups however the protein expression was decreased in the late radiation period which is reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment. Intracavernosal pressure measurements were performed only in the late period as erectile dysfunction is a late complication of irradiation. The ICP/MAP ratio was significantly decreased in Rd-L group and was significantly reversed back to control levels with RvT treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Resveratrol, due to its strong anti-oxidant effects, may be a potential candidate for the management of oxidative stress induced erectile dysfunction in patients undergoing pelvic irradiation, if supported with further clinical studies.

4502,"The SOCS box protein STOPS is required for phototransduction through its effects on phospholipase C. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes play roles in a diversity of processes including Drosophila phototransduction. In fly photoreceptor cells, the PLCbeta encoded by norpA is critical for activation of TRP channels. Here, we describe a PLCbeta regulator, STOPS, which encodes a SOCS box protein. Mutation of stops resulted in a reduced concentration of NORPA and a defect in stopping signaling following cessation of the light stimulus. NORPA has been proposed to have dual roles as a PLC- and GTPase-activating protein (GAP). We found that the slow termination resulting from expressing low levels of wild-type NORPA was suppressed by addition of normal amounts of an altered NORPA, which had wild-type GAP activity, but no PLC activity. STOPS is the first protein identified that specifically regulates PLCbeta protein concentration. Moreover, this work demonstrates that a PLCbeta derivative that does not promote TRP channel activation, still contributes to signaling in vivo.",Excluded

The intrinsic resolution of the Donner 600-crystal positron emission tomograph (PET 600) is 2.6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) in-plane and 6 mm FWHM axially. More than 100 patients with glioma, radiation necrosis, Alzheimer disease, or epilepsy have been studied with this system.

Normal structures as small as the superior colliculi and the external capsule have been resolved. Improved separation of the cortical ribbon from adjacent white matter has allowed more accurate determination of cortical metabolic rate. In two of 15 patients undergoing evaluation for recurrent glioma, the PET 600 images showed tumor uptake that was not apparent on a lower-resolution study. A high-activity orbiting transmission source with electronic collimation allows accurate, short-duration transmission measurements to be made after radiopharmaceutical administration.

PURPOSE: To expedite improved understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare malignancy of cutaneous neuroendocrine cells that has a 28% 2-year mortality rate.METHODS: This article summarizes a workshop that discussed the state-of-the-art research and priorities for research on MCC and on a new human polyomavirus (ie, MCPyV) recently discovered in 80% of MCC tumors.RESULTS: Normal Merkel cells are widely distributed in the epidermis near the end of nerve axons and may function as mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors. Malignant MCC cells typically stain for cytokeratin 20 as well as for other epithelial and neuroendocrine markers. MCC subtypes, which are based on histology, on cell line growth properties, and on gene expression profiles, have been reported but have not been linked to prognosis. Clinical management has been empiric. MCPyV is clonally integrated at various sites in the human genome of MCC tumors, with truncating mutations in the viral, large T antigen gene that interrupt viral replication. MCPyV seroprevalence may be high, as with previously known human polyomaviruses. MCC risk is increased 11-fold with AIDS and with other cell-mediated immune deficiencies, B-cell neoplasms, and ultraviolet radiation exposure.CONCLUSION: Development and validation of a range quantitative polymerase chain reaction and serologic assays for detection of MCPyV, as well as an infectious clone of the virus, would clarify the fundamental biology, natural history, and epidemiology of the virus, of MCC, and of other diseases. Contingent on standardized histologic diagnosis and staging of MCC, consortia are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of sentinel lymph node biopsy, adjuvant radiation therapy, and salvage therapies; consortia are needed also for epidemiologic studies of MCC etiology.

The quadriceps VA level, motor-evoked potential (MEP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were tested before and after 30 minutes of low-intensity electrical stimulation (ES).Results: Before ES, the quadriceps VA in the ACL lesion legs of the ACL group was lower compared to the legs of the healthy control group (P < 0.05). The MEP sizes in the ACL lesion legs and the healthy control were not significantly different. The ACL lesion legs showed lower SICI and higher ICF compared to the healthy control group (P < 0.05). After ES, the quadriceps VA level increased and the SICI-ICF was modulated only in the ACL lesion legs (P < 0.05) but not in the healthy controls.Conclusions: Low-intensity ES can normalize the modulation of intracortical inhibition and facilitation, thereby ameliorating the activation failure in individuals with ACL lesion.",Excluded
4366,"Cryptochromes and inner retinal non-visual irradiance detection. Nearly all circadian clocks have free-running periods that differ significantly from 24 hours. To maintain synchrony with the 24 h day, the mammalian circadian clock is reset by light. Unlike other animals, mammalian circadian entrainment occurs exclusively via the eyes and optic nerves. Remarkably, the classical photoreceptors--the rods and cones--are not necessary for photic entrainment. Instead, a subset of inner retinal ganglion cells are directly photoresponsive and transmit photic information specifically to brain centres involved in irradiance detection, including the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The photopigment(s) responsible for inner retinal phototransduction are unknown. Several lines of evidence constrain candidate photopigments. First, near-total vitamin A depletion does not diminish retinohypothalamic signalling. Second, loss of cryptochrome function in retinal-degenerate mice substantially decreases photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and markedly decreases pupillary light responses. Third, vitamin A depletion of cryptochrome mutant mice leads to loss of photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These findings suggest a model where either classical photopigments or inner retinal photopigments are sufficient for non-visual irradiance detection.",Excluded

We investigated the sulfhydryl moiety of this compound. Down regulation of glutathione (GSH) by buthionine sulfoximine in cultured cells resulted in increase of BSH uptake (7.9-36.5%) compared to the control group and consequently the cytocidal effect of neutron irradiation also increased. On the other hand, the radiation caused damage by gamma-ray irradiation was suppressed when BSH uptake increased. These findings suggested that modulation of GSH enhanced the effect of B (n, alpha) reaction and the protective effect of secondary gamma-ray in BNCT.",Excluded

4019,"Prevalence and predictors of knee pain with neuropathic features in a community based cohort. Purpose: The aetiopathology of pain in osteoarthritis (OA) is poorly understood and a combination of local nociceptive and more central neuropathic mechanisms is likely. This may be critical in helping to guide individualized patient care. Previous studies have shown that neuropathic pain, associated with significantly higher levels of mood disturbance, is present in over onequarter of older adults with chronic symptomatic radiographic knee OA. The study aims were to determine the prevalence and predictors of neuropathic pain using the painDetect questionnaire (PDQ) in a UK community-based cohort of women with knee pain. Method(s): Participants were selected from an established longitudinal population-based cohort, of 1003 women aged 43-65 years from a single general practice in the UK recruited in 1988-9. Those attending the year 20 follow-up visit with self-reported knee pain in the preceding month were included in this study. Participants self-completed the PDQ for each symptomatic knee reported. The PDQ assesses pain quality, pattern and radiation of pain resulting in a composite score (range -1 to 38) and, in patients with low back pain, the thresholds are 13-18 for possible neuropathic pain and >19 for likely neuropathic pain with 85% sensitivity, 80% specificity and 83% positive predictive value. Participants also completed: the hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS); the average knee pain severity over the preceding month was documented using a numeric rating scale of 0-10; pain in six other joints (shoulders, hips and hands); use of analgesia (paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids) and neuropathic medications (antidepressants and anticonvulsants). Age, height and weight were recorded and fully extended radiographs of the knees taken within 5 years were graded for structural features of OA using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) scoring system, with radiographic OA (ROA) defined as KL > 2. PDQ scores were log transformed and we used linear regression, with GEE to account for clustering of knees from the same participant, to identify factors associated with neuropathic pain adjusting for age, BMI and analgesia and neuropathic medication use. Result(s): Of 565 participants attending the year 20 follow-up visit, 146 participants reported knee pain in the preceding month, of which 42 complained of bilateral knee pain corresponding to a total of 188 (Table presented) symptomatic knees. Included participants had a higher BMI and number of other painful joints, were less likely to have ROA and more likely to use analgesia, compared to those without knee pain. HADS did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Only 10/188 (5.3%) and 2/188 (1.1%) knees fulfilled the standard criteria for possible and likely neuropathic pain respectively (Figure). However, few knees were painful without any neuropathic features 8/188 (4.3%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that both HADS and pain severity, but not ROA or number of painful joints, were significantly positively associated with PDQ score. These associations persisted inmultivariate analysiswhen adjusted for age, BMI and medication use. For each unit increase in HADS and pain severity, PDQ increased by 4% (1%-8%) and 10% (5%-15%) respectively (Table 1). Conclusion(s): Of those with self-reported knee pain from a communitybased cohort, few fulfilled the criteria for possible and likely neuropathic pain using the standard PDQ thresholds. However, neuropathic features were more common with both increasing severity of knee pain and also measures of anxiety and depression. Evaluation for features of neuropathic pain as well as mood should be considered in patients with knee pain and may represent an important therapeutic target.

Both mu- and delta-opioid agonists selectively inhibit nociception but have little effect on other sensory modalities. Voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in the primary sensory neurons are important for the regulation of nociceptive transmission. In this study, we determined the effect of delta-opioid agonists on voltage-activated Ca(2+) channel currents (I(Ca)) in small-diameter rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that do and do not bind isolectin B(4) (IB(4)). The delta-opioid agonists [d-Pen(2),d-Pen(5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) and deltorphin II produced a greater inhibition of high voltage-activated I(Ca) in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons. Furthermore, DPDPE produced a greater inhibition of N-, P/Q-, and L-type I(Ca) in IB(4)-negative than IB(4)-positive neurons. However, DPDPE had no significant effect on the R-type I(Ca) in either type of cells. We were surprised to find that DPDPE failed to inhibit either the T-type or high voltage-activated I(Ca) in all the DRG neurons with T-type I(Ca). Double immunofluorescence labeling showed that the majority of the delta-opioid receptor-immunoreactive DRG neurons had IB(4) labeling, while all DRG neurons immunoreactive to delta-opioid receptors exhibited Cav(3.2) immunoreactivity. Additionally, DPDPE significantly inhibited high voltage-activated I(Ca) in Tyrode's or N-methyl-d-glucamine solution but not in tetraethylammonium solution. This study provides new information that delta-opioid agonists have a distinct effect on voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in different phenotypes of primary sensory neurons.

Spectral data for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were derived from 65 spectroscopic observations in patients with previously treated gliomas (n = 16) and metastatic tumors (n = 2). Spectral data for choline (Cho), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and lipid-lactate were analyzed separately and in conjunction with ADCs in all patients (15 observations of pure tumor, 33 observations of pure necrosis, and 13 observations of mixed tumor and necrosis). Histological specimens were obtained stereotactically at the time of surgery (<48 h after image acquisition) for recurrent disease and digitally co-registered with MRS data.RESULTS: ADC values for pure tumor, pure necrosis, and mixed tumor and necrosis were 1.30, 1.60, and 1.42, respectively. Cho/NAA less than 0.20, NAA/normal Cr greater than 1.56, and NAA/Cho greater than 1.32 increase the odds that a tissue biopsy will be pure necrosis versus mixed tumor and necrosis. Although various values of all MRS ratios analyzed may provide positive correlations for histopathological differentiation of tissue between that of pure tumor and that of pure necrosis, the addition of ADC values to only NAA/Cho and NAA/normal Cr increases the odds of correct differentiation between pure tumor and pure necrosis. The addition of ADC values does not provide additional information beyond that of MRS in distinguishing specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis from either pure tumor or pure necrosis.CONCLUSION: It has been demonstrated that MRS ratio analysis may allow for the clinical discrimination between specimens of pure tumor and pure necrosis, and the addition of ADC data into this analysis may enhance this specific differentiation. However, although a trend toward correlation between ADC values and the various histopathological features was noted, the direct addition of ADC data does not seem to allow further discrimination, beyond that provided by MRS, among specimens of mixed tumor and necrosis and either pure tumor or pure necrosis.",Excluded

3989,"Perception of sniff phase in mouse olfaction. Olfactory systems encode odours by which neurons respond and by when they respond. In mammals, every sniff evokes a precise, odour-specific sequence of activity across olfactory neurons. Likewise, in a variety of neural systems, ranging from sensory periphery to cognitive centres, neuronal activity is timed relative to sampling behaviour and/or internally generated oscillations. As in these neural systems, relative timing of activity may represent information in the olfactory system. However, there is no evidence that mammalian olfactory systems read such cues. To test whether mice perceive the timing of olfactory activation relative to the sniff cycle ('sniff phase'), we used optogenetics in gene-targeted mice to generate spatially constant, temporally controllable olfactory input. Here we show that mice can behaviourally report the sniff phase of optogenetically driven activation of olfactory sensory neurons. Furthermore, mice can discriminate between light-evoked inputs that are shifted in the sniff cycle by as little as 10 milliseconds, which is similar to the temporal precision of olfactory bulb odour responses. Electrophysiological recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice show that individual cells encode the timing of photoactivation in relation to the sniff in both the timing and the amplitude of their responses. Our work provides evidence that the mammalian olfactory system can read temporal patterns, and suggests that timing of activity relative to sampling behaviour is a potent cue that may enable accurate olfactory percepts to form quickly.",Excluded

4071,"Self-rotations in simulated microgravity: performance effects of strategy training. INTRODUCTION: This research studies reorientation methodologies in a simulated microgravity environment using an experimental framework to reduce astronaut adaptation time and provide for a safety countermeasure during extravehicular activity.METHODS: There were 20 subjects (10 men, 10 women, mean age of 23.6 +/- 3.5) who were divided into 2 groups, fully trained and minimally trained, which determined the amount of motion strategy training received. Subjects performed a total of 48 rotations about their pitch, roll, and yaw axes in a suspension system that simulated microgravity. In each trial subjects either rotated 90 degrees in pitch, 90 degrees in roll, or 180 degrees in yaw. Experimental measures include subject coordination, performance time, cognitive workload assessments, and qualitative motion control strategies.RESULTS: Subjects in the fully trained group had better initial performance with respect to performance time and workload scores for the pitch and yaw rotations. Further, trained subjects reached a steady-state performance time in fewer trials than those with minimal training. The subjects with minimal training tended to use motions that were common in an Earth environment since no technique was provided. For roll rotations they developed motions that would have led to significant off-axis (pitch and yaw) rotations in a true microgravity environment.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that certain body axes are easier to rotate about than others and that fully trained subjects had an easier time performing the body rotations than the minimally trained subjects. This study has provided the groundwork for the development of an astronaut motion-control training program.",Excluded
4805,"Disrutpted resting-state functional architecture of the brain after 45-day simulated microgravity. Long-term spaceflight induces both physiological and psychological changes in astronauts. To understand the neural mechanisms underlying these physiological and psychological changes, it is critical to investigate the effects of microgravity on the functional architecture of the brain. In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to study whether the functional architecture of the brain is altered after 45 days of -6degree head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest, which is a reliable model for the simulation of microgravity. Sixteen healthy male volunteers underwent rs-fMRI scans before and after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Specifically, we used a commonly employed graph-based measure of network organization, i.e., degree centrality (DC), to perform a full-brain exploration of the regions that were influenced by simulated microgravity. We subsequently examined the functional connectivities of these regions using a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis. We found decreased DC in two regions, the left anterior insula (aINS) and the anterior part of the middle cingulate cortex (MCC; also called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in many studies), in the male volunteers after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Furthermore, seed-based RSFC analyses revealed that a functional network anchored in the aINS and MCC was particularly influenced by simulated microgravity. These results provide evidence that simulated microgravity alters the resting-state functional architecture of the brains of males and suggest that the processing of salience information, which is primarily subserved by the aINS-MCC functional network, is particularly influenced by spaceflight. The current findings provide a new perspective for understanding the relationships between microgravity, cognitive function, autonomic neural function, and central neural activity. © 2014 Zhou, Wang, Rao, Liang, Chen, Zheng, Tan, Tian, Wang, Bai, Chen and Li.",Excluded
4638,"Sodium sulfide selectively induces oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction and radiosensitizes glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Glioblastoma (GBM) has a poor prognosis despite intensive treatment with surgery and chemoradiotherapy. Previous studies using dose-escalated radiotherapy have demonstrated improved survival; however, increased rates of radionecrosis have limited its use. Development of radiosensitizers could improve patient outcome. In the present study, we report the use of sodium sulfide (Na<sub>2</sub>S), a hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) donor, to selectively kill GBM cells (T98G and U87) while sparing normal human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3). Na<sub>2</sub>S also decreased mitochondrial respiration, increased oxidative stress and induced gammaH2AX foci and oxidative base damage in GBM cells. Since Na<sub>2</sub>S did not significantly alter T98G capacity to perform non-homologous end-joining or base excision repair, it is possible that GBM cell killing could be attributed to increased damage induction due to enhanced reactive oxygen species production. Interestingly, Na<sub>2</sub>S enhanced mitochondrial respiration, produced a more reducing environment and did not induce high levels of DNA damage in hCMEC/D3. Taken together, this data suggests involvement of mitochondrial respiration in Na<sub>2</sub>S toxicity in GBM cells. The fact that survival of LN-18 GBM cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (rho<sup>0</sup>) was not altered by Na<sub>2</sub>S whereas the survival of LN-18 rho<sup>+</sup> cells was compromised supports this conclusion. When cells were treated with Na<sub>2</sub>S and photon or proton radiation, GBM cell killing was enhanced, which opens the possibility of H<sub>2</sub>S being a radiosensitizer. Therefore, this study provides the first evidence that H<sub>2</sub>S donors could be used in GBM therapy to potentiate radiation-induced killing.",Excluded
3666,"Melatonin secretion following brain midline irradiation is diminished, but not correlated with subjective sleep disturbances. Objective: Cranial irradiation for brain tumours or leukaemias has been related to cognitive, endocrine and psychosocial late effects as well as sleep disturbances and increased daytime sleepiness. Studies suggest that cranial irradiation might impact on pineal melatonin secretion. Melatonin is an important regulator in human circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate melatonin secretion, subjective sleep parameters and their interplay in a cohort of cranially irradiated head and brain tumour and leukaemia survivors at least 3 years after radiotherapy. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Patient(s): Thirty-eight adults. Measurements: Melatonin secretion was evaluated by measuring its metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin in collected overnight urine. Subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory II was used to screen for depressive symptoms because of their impact on sleep. Result(s): Patients irradiated in the brain midline had significantly lower melatonin secretion (P = 0.008). Subjects exhibited a high prevalence of sleeping difficulties, daytime sleepiness and depression, with females and overweight subjects particularly affected. Melatonin values and subjective sleep parameters did not correlate with each other or with treatment and most patient variables. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that radiation exposure to the pineal gland negatively affects melatonin secretion. This lack of pineal melatonin does not influence subjective sleep quality. As melatonin has important antioxidant and cancer-protective effects, further research is necessary to elucidate whether these patients have an increased risk of developing secondary neoplasms and other radiation late effects.

To begin to determine the underlying neural mechanisms of memory formation, we studied two different cell types that play important roles in different forms of associative learning in Lymnaea. Statocyst neurons (hair cells) mediate classical conditioning, whereas RPeD1 is a site of memory formation induced by operant conditioning of aerial respiration. Because potassium (K(+)) channels play a critical role in neuronal excitability, we initiated studies on these channels in the aforementioned neurons. Three distinct K(+) currents are expressed in the soma of both the hair cells and RPeD1. In hair cells and RPeD1, there is a fast activating and rapidly inactivating 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive A current (I(A)), a tetraethyl ammonium (TEA)-sensitive delayed rectifying current, which exhibits slow inactivation kinetics (I(KV)), and a TEA- and 4-AP-insensitive Ca(2+)-dependent current (I(Ca-K)). In hair cells, the activation voltage of I(A); its half-maximal steady-state activation voltage and its half-maximal steady-state inactivation were at more depolarized levels than in RPeD1. The time constant of recovery from I(A) inactivation was slightly faster in hair cells. I(A) in hair cells is also smaller in amplitude than in RPeD1 and is activated at more depolarized potentials. In like manner, I(KV) is smaller in hair cells and is activated at more depolarized potentials than in RPeD1.",Excluded
3672,"The polyamine inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine modulates hippocampus-dependent function after single and combined injuries. Exposure to uncontrolled irradiation in a radiologic terrorism scenario, a natural disaster or a nuclear battlefield, will likely be concomitantly superimposed on other types of injury, such as trauma. In the central nervous system, radiation combined injury (RCI) involving irradiation and traumatic brain injury may have a multifaceted character. This may entail cellular and molecular changes that are associated with cognitive performance, including changes in neurogenesis and the expression of the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc. Because traumatic stimuli initiate a characteristic early increase in polyamine metabolism, we hypothesized that treatment with the polyamine inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) would reduce the adverse effects of single or combined injury on hippocampus structure and function. Hippocampal dependent cognitive impairments were quantified with the Morris water maze and showed that DFMO effectively reversed cognitive impairments after all injuries, particularly traumatic brain injury. Similar results were seen with respect to the expression of Arc protein, but not neurogenesis. Given that polyamines have been found to modulate inflammatory responses in the brain we also assessed the numbers of total and newly born activated microglia, and found reduced numbers of newly born cells. While the mechanisms responsible for the improvement in cognition after DFMO treatment are not yet clear, the present study provides new and compelling data regarding the potential use of DFMO as a potential countermeasure against the adverse effects of single or combined injury.",Excluded

Immediately after hyperalgesia tests, blood samples were collected to analyze creatine kinase (CK) activity and the soleus muscle was removed for histological and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha immunohistological analyses. In all LEDT groups, plasma CK activity was reduced to levels similar to those measured in the CON group.

Acute, subacute and chronic neurotoxicity have been observed after the administration of high-dose and/or intrathecal methotrexate (MTX). Acute toxicity is usually transient without permanent damage. Subacute and chronic toxicity are associated with changes in the brain and/or the spinal cord which may be progressive and even lead to coma and death in severe cases. It is believed that MTX can induce direct toxic effects to the CNS by damaging the neuronal tissue. Moreover, MTX interferes with the metabolic pathways of folates, excitatory amino acids, homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine, adenosine and biopterins, inducing biochemical alterations which have been associated with neurotoxic symptoms. It has been suggested that acute toxicity is partly mediated by adenosine, whereas homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine, excitatory amino acids and biopterins may play an important role in the development of subacute and chronic toxicity. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of MTX neurotoxicity would offer the possibility of developing new therapeutic strategies for its treatment or prevention. Copyright © 2003 S.

Ten healthy men ages 19 to 37 took part in the study. EEG was recor- ded daily over the 25 days test period that was marked by C- and M-class solar flares and geomagnetic storm levels in the G2-G3 range. The EEG signals were used for the estimate of the mul-tivariate temporal structure function (SF) of the first order in 8-dimensional space. The value of the SF correlation radius is used here as an estimation of a scale of the integral temporal correlation structure of multi-channel EEG, while the value of the SF horizontal asymptote is used as an estimation of the spatial correlation structure of EEG. It is shown that GMA variations make an even greater impact on the SF correlation radius, than on the SF asymptote. We reveal the disturbing and modulating effects of geomagnetic and solar activity on the SF parameters and its power spectrum. Thus, the SF of multi-channel EEG allows us to estimate the effects of heliogeophysical factors on the integrated brain reaction as a unitary system and may be used to investigate the environmental influence on the humans.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): The optimal fractionation schedule for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) involving the base of skull and intracranium is unknown.We found hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and concomitant chemotherapy (CCT) could achieve better local control and survival in NPC patients with T3 and T4 lesions at 3 year follow up. To confirm the effect of this approach, we analyzed more patients with long term follow up. Materials/Methods: From January 1992 to Dec 2003, 222 patients (74 T3 and 148 T4 NPC) were treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and concomitant chemotherapy (CCT). HFRT was administered at 1.2 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day, Monday-Friday for 62 fractions for a total dose of 74.4 Gy. Concomitant chemotherapy consisting of cis-diamino-dichloroplatinum (CDDP) alone or CDDP and 5-fluorouracil were delivered simultaneously with radiotherapy during Weeks 1 and 6. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of CDDP and 5-fluorouracil for 2 to 3 cycles and was given monthly beginning 1 month after completion of radiation. Result(s):With a median follow-up of 102 months (range: 5 - 186 months), the 5-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 81.9%, 78.5%, 65.5% and 73.6%, respectively. At 10 years, the 10-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 76.7%, 75.5%, 60.5% and 64.2%, respectively. For T4 patients, the 10-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 73.0%, 70.5%, 53.0% and 58.4%, respectively. The major chronic toxicity was Grade 3/4 hearing impairment in 14% of patients. Brain necrosis rate is 2.3%. Conclusion(s): HFRT and CCT for T3 and T4 NPC were associated with good local control, survival and little treatment-related long term toxicity. But, the 10 year treatment result is suboptimal. To further improve the 10 year locoregional control rate for T4 NPC patients, we may consider using HFRT to give higher radiation dose up to 78 Gy with CCT in the IMRT era.",Excluded

Objective: The goal of this study was to assess the role of flattening filter-free (FFF) beams in volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy for patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC). Method(s): 13 patients with rNPC were replanned for FFF RapidArc<sup>-></sup> (RA-FFF) and conventional RapidArc (RA) (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Quantitative evaluation was performed for the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Phantom dose verifications, treatment delivery time and monitor units (MUs) were also assessed. Result(s): Each technique delivered similar doses to the PTV. RA-FFF had a better sparing effect on the brain stem and normal tissue when compared with RA, whereas RA provided lower mean doses to the skin. No significant difference between the two techniques could be established for other OAR parameters. Both techniques showed equally good gamma scores in dosimetric verification. RAFFF required more MUs than RA, whereas the delivery time for RA-FFF was slightly shorter than for RA. Conclusion(s): Both treatment plans met the planning objectives. Dose measurements also showed good agreement with computed doses. In addition to slightly faster delivery times, RA-FFF produced better sparing of brain stem and normal tissue with uncompromised target coverage compared with RA. Advances in knowledge: FFF beams have recently been assembled for clinical use. Our findings show RA-FFF is useful in the salvage treatment of rNPC owing to better brain stem and normal tissue sparing with uncompromised target coverage compared with RA.

3982,"Cancer pain (classification and pain syndromes). Inspite the new informations about the physiology and biochemistry of pain, it remains true that pain is only partially understood. Cancer pain is often experienced as several different types of pain, with combined somatic and neuropathic types the most frequently. If the acute cancer pain does not subside with initial therapy, patients experience pain of more constant nature, the characteristics of wich vary with the cause and the involved sites. Chronic pain related to cancer can be considered as tumor-induced pain, chemotherapy-induced pain, and radiation therapy-induced pain. Certain pain mechanisms are present in cancer patients. These include inflammation due to infection, such as local sepsis or the pain of herpes zoster, and pain due to the obstruction or occlusion of a hollow organ, such as that caused by large bowel in cancer of colon. Pain also is commonly due to destruction of tissue, such as is often seen with bony metastases. Bony metastases also produce pain because of periostal irritation, medullary pressure, and fractures. Pain may be produced by the growth of tumor in a closed area richly supplied with pain receptors (nociceptors). Examples are tumors growing within the capsule of an organ such as the pancreas. Chest pain occurring after tumor of the lung or the mediastinum due to invasion of the pleura. Certain tumors produce characteristic types of pain.

To benchmark both gel dosimeters, they were exposed to a 6 MV photon beam and the depth dose was compared against a diamond detector measurement that served as golden standard. Both gel dosimeters were found accurate within 4% accuracy. In the 3D dose matrix of the radiochromic gel, hotspot dose deviations up to 8% were observed which are attributed to the fabrication procedure. The polymer gel readout was shown to be sensitive to B0 field and B1 field non-uniformities as well as temperature variations during scanning. The performance of the two gel dosimeters was also evaluated for a brain tumour IMRT treatment. Both gel measured dose distributions were compared against treatment planning system predicted dose maps which were validated independently with ion chamber measurements and portal dosimetry. In the radiochromic gel measurement, two sources of deviations could be identified. Firstly, the dose in a cluster of voxels near the edge of the phantom deviated from the planned dose. Secondly, the presence of dose hotspots in the order of 10% related to inhomogeneities in the gel limit the clinical acceptance of this dosimetry technique.

3976,"Comparison of Neutron Organ and Effective Dose Coefficients for PIMAL Stylized Phantoms in Bent Postures in Cranial and Caudal Irradiation Geometries. ABSTRACT: Radiation dose estimations in the human body are performed using computational reference phantoms, which are anatomical representations of the human body. In previous studies, dose reconstructions have been performed focusing primarily on phantoms in an upright posture, which limits the accuracy of the dose estimations for postures observed in realistic work settings. In this work, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 103 recommendations for monoenergetic neutron plane sources directed downward from above the head (cranial) and upward from below the feet (caudal) for adult female and male reference phantoms were used to calculate organ absorbed and effective dose coefficients. The Phantom with Moving Arms and Legs (PIMAL) and the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) radiation transport code were used to compute organ-absorbed dose and effective dose coefficients for the upright, half-bent (45degree), and full-bent (90degree) phantom postures. The doses calculated for each of the articulated positions were compared to those calculated for the upright posture by computing the ratios of the coefficients (45degree/upright and 90degree/upright). These ratios were used to assess the effectiveness of upright phantoms in providing a comparable estimate when conducting dose estimations and dose reconstructions for articulated positions. This work compiling neutron cranial and caudal posture-specific dose coefficients completes the series of dose coefficients computed for posture-specific ICRP Publication 116 irradiation geometries for monoenergetic photons and neutrons, in addition to cranial and caudal monoenergetic photons. Results reported demonstrated that organ-absorbed dose coefficients for most of the organs in the CRA and CAU irradiation geometries were significantly higher for the bent phantoms than for the upright phantom. Since the upright phantom underestimates the organ-absorbed dose, this demonstrates the impact of posture while performing dose calculations. Organ doses reported in past neutron dose coefficient data were found to omit effects from neutron resonances at energies of 0.435, 1.0, and 3.21 MeV from 16O in tissue. Reported data notes as high as 60% underestimation for neutron organ-absorbed doses, specifically at the neutron resonance energy region omitted by smoothing. Ongoing studies are examining the effect of resonances on reported neutron organ-absorbed dose coefficients in ICRP 116 geometries.",Excluded
3967,"Optimizing cancer radiotherapy with 2-deoxy-D-glucose: Dose escalation studies in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Background and Purpose: Higher rates of glucose utilization and glycolysis generally correlate with poor prognosis in several types of malignant tumors. Own earlier studies on model systems demonstrated that the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) could enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in a dose-dependent manner by selectively sensitizing cancer cells while protecting normal cells. Phase I/II clinical trials indicated that the combination of 2-DG, at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg body weight (BW), with large fractions of gamma-radiation was well tolerated in cerebral glioma patients. Since higher 2-DG doses are expected to improve the therapeutic gain, present studies were undertaken to examine the tolerance and safety of escalating 2-DG dose during combined treatment (2-DG + radiotherapy) in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Patients and Methods: Untreated patients with histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme (WHO criteria) were included in the study. Seven weekly fractions of <sup>60</sup>Co gamma-rays (5 Gy/fraction) were delivered to the tumor volume (presurgical CT/MRI evaluation) plus 3 cm margin. Escalating 2-DG doses (200-250-300 mg/kg BW) were administered orally 30 min before irradiation after overnight fasting. Acute toxicity and tolerance were studied by monitoring the vital parameters and side effects. Late radiation damage and treatment responses were studied radiologically and clinically in surviving patients. Result(s): Transient side effects similar to hypoglycemia were observed in most of the patients. Tolerance and patient compliance to the combined treatment were very good up to a 2-DG dose of 250 mg/kg BW. However, at the higher dose of 300 mg/kg BW, two out of six patients were very restless and could not complete treatment, though significant changes in the vital parameters were not observed even at this dose. No significant damage to the normal brain tissue was observed during follow-up in seven out of ten patients who received complete treatment and survived between 11 and 46 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Oral administration of 2-DG combined with large fractions of radiation (5 Gy/fraction/week) is safe and could be tolerated in glioblastoma patients without any acute toxicity and late radiation damage to the normal brain.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is known to induce angiogenesis in irradiated tissue and has been proven to reduce late radiation injury in several normal tissues when applied during the latent period before complications become manifest. In the present study: (1) the prophylactic potential of HBO; (2) optimal timing of HBO therapy after spinal cord irradiation, i.e. during the latent period; and (3) effect of HBO on the re-irradiation tolerance of the spinal cord were investigated. The rat cervical spinal cord was locally X-ray irradiated with ten fractions of 6.5 Gy in 11 days. Five treatment groups (n=10) included: irradiation alone and irradiation followed by 30 HBO treatments (100% oxygen at 240 kPa for 90 min) during latency, with HBO starting either immediately, 5, 10 or 15 weeks after the primary irradiation course. One year after the primary treatment, the same spinal cord volume was re-irradiated with 20 Gy single dose. During life span, the animals were observed on the incidence of myelitis and the duration of the latent period. The actuarial analysis revealed no significant difference in neurological complications free survival between the irradiation alone and the irradiation+HBO treatment groups. A tendency towards radiosensitization was found in the group in which the primary irradiation course was immediately followed by the HBO treatment course. The data show that HBO applied during the latent period of progressively developing irradiation damage to the spinal cord does not increase the re-irradiation tolerance of this tissue. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

OBJECTIVES: Perceptual judgments and patients' perception of voice and speech after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for advanced head and neck cancer.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial.METHODS: A standard Dutch text and a diadochokinetic task were recorded. Expert listeners rated voice and speech quality (based on Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain), articulation (overall, [p], [t], [k]), and comparative mean opinion scores of voice and speech at three assessment points calculated. A structured study-specific questionnaire evaluated patients' perception pretreatment (N=55), at 10-week (N=49) and 1-year posttreatment (N=37).RESULTS: At 10 weeks, perceptual voice quality is significantly affected. The parameters overall voice quality (mean, -0.24; P=0.008), strain (mean, -0.12; P=0.012), nasality (mean, -0.08; P=0.009), roughness (mean, -0.22; P=0.001), and pitch (mean, -0.03; P=0.041) improved over time but not beyond baseline levels, except for asthenia at 1-year posttreatment (voice is less asthenic than at baseline; mean, +0.20; P=0.03). Perceptual analyses of articulation showed no significant differences. Patients judge their voice quality as good (score, 18/20) at all assessment points, but at 1-year posttreatment, most of them (70%) judge their ""voice not as it used to be."" In the 1-year versus 10-week posttreatment comparison, the larynx-hypopharynx tumor group was more strained, whereas nonlarynx tumor voices were judged less strained (mean, -0.33 and +0.07, respectively; P=0.031). Patients' perceived changes in voice and speech quality at 10-week post- versus pretreatment correlate weakly with expert judgments.CONCLUSION: Overall, perceptual CCRT effects on voice and speech seem to peak at 10-week posttreatment but level off at 1-year posttreatment. However, at that assessment point, most patients still perceive their voice as different from baseline.",Excluded

4256,"Astroglial swelling in the neuronal depolarization ensemble. The coupling between neuronal depolarization and astroglial swelling was examined. First, previous in vitro data for the swelling of cultured neurons (N18; rat neuroblastoma) and astroglia (C6; rat astroglyoma) upon exposure to a hypoosmotic solution were reappraised. Neurons swelled rapidly, forming blisters, and easily burst. whereas astroglia resisted swelling and slowly assumed a large full-moon shape. The time constant of swelling was 35.2 +/- 7.8 s for N18 and 594.8 +/- 554.0 s for C6. The glial plasmic membrane was found to be much stronger than the neuronal one, presumably due to a well-developed cytoskeleton. To overcome such neuronal membranous weakness, strong astroglial processes need to cover the neurons including the cell body and synapses, as demonstrated electron-microscopically. Next, in situ astroglial swelling was investigated in rats. During K(+)-induced cortical spreading depression, increases or decreases of a wave-ring spread of light (550 nm) transmission through a 1 mm-thick cerebral cortical layer was observed. The moving local optical density decrease in the cortex was attributable to local vascular bed compression induced by astroglial swelling, since concomitant occurrence of colocated dynamic capillary flow stall was confirmed by a hemodilution technique. Astroglial swelling may occur in an ensemble acting during neuronal depolarization, suggesting that neurons and astroglia behave like a unit complex.",Excluded

In this study we investigated the effects of radiation in an age-matched series of 3xTg-AD mice. Mice were hemibrain-irradiated with 5 fractions of 2 Gy and sacrificed 8 weeks after the end of treatment. Abeta and tau were assessed using immunohistochemistry and quantified using image analysis with Definiens Tissue Studio. We observed a significant reduction in Abeta plaque burden and tau staining; these two parameters were significantly correlated.

4374,"Mechanism of magnetization transfer during on-resonance water saturation. A new approach to detect mobile proteins, peptides, and lipids. The mechanism of magnetization transfer (MT) between water and components of the proton spectrum was studied ex vivo in a perfused cell system and in vivo in the rat brain (n = 5). Water was selectively labeled and spectral buildup consequential to transfer of longitudinal magnetization was followed as a function of time. At short mixing time (T(m)), nitrogen-bound solvent-exchangeable protons were observed, predominantly assigned to amide groups of proteins and peptides. At longer T(m), intramolecular nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) was observed in the aliphatic proton region, leading to a mobile-macromolecule-weighted spectrum that resembles typical protein spectra described in the literature. This effect on the proton spectrum is distinct from that of classical off-resonance MT, which has been shown to be due to the immobile solid-like proton pool. When studying a solution of major brain metabolites under physiological concentrations and conditions (pH), no transfer effects were observed, in line with expectations based on reduced NOE effects in rapidly tumbling molecules and the fast proton exchange rates of amino, amine, SH, and OH groups. The spectral intensities of the amide protons may serve as indicators for pH and cellular levels of mobile proteins and peptides, while the aliphatic components are representative of several types of mobile macromolecules, including proteins, peptides, and lipids.",Excluded

4605,"Gamma knife radiosurgery after stereotactic aspiration for large cystic brain metastases. Objective : Several treatment options have proven effective for metastatic brain tumors, including surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery. Tumors with cystic components, however, are difficult to treat using a single method. We retrospectively assessed the outcome and efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for cystic brain metastases after stereotactic aspiration of cystic components to decrease the tumor volume. Methods : The study population consisted of 24 patients (13 males, 11 females; mean age, 58.3 years) with cystic metastatic brain tumors treated from January 2002 to August 2008. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common primary origin. After Leksell stereotactic frame was positioned on each patient, magnetic resonance images (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and GKRS were performed (mean prescription dose : 20.2 Gy). After treatment, patients were evaluated by MRI every 3 or 4 months. Results : After treatment, 13 patients (54.2%) demonstrated tumor control, 5 patients (20.8%) showed local tumor progression, and 6 patients (25.0%) showed remote progression. Mean follow-up duration was 13.1 months. During this period, 10 patients (41.7%) died, but only 1 patient (4.2%) died from brain metastases. The overall median survival after these procedures was 17.8 months. Conclusion : These results support the usefulness of GKRS after stereotactic cyst aspiration in patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is especially effective for the patients whose general condition is very poor for general anesthesia and those with metastatic brain tumors located in eloquent areas.

3668,"A reappraisal of the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer. The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited stage small cell lung cancer remains controversial. Prospective trials have demonstrated that PCI can reduce central nervous system relapse rates, but the impact on survival remains questionable except for the possible evidence of a beneficial effect for long term survivors. With higher rates of thoracic control now obtainable with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant chemotherapy, it becomes important to analyze the benefit of PCI in that setting. Before 1982, we included PCI in the management of all patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer; thereafter, we discontinued its use. This report compares the outcome of the two treatment approaches and addresses the role of PCI among patients who achieve durable local control. There were 36 limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with PCI from 1979-1982 and 26 patients treated without PCI from 1985-1989. Induction chemotherapy was followed in both groups by thoracic irradiation (45 Gy). The PCI patients received 30 Gy to the whole brain in 10 fractions. Both groups received maintenance chemotherapy. Of complete responders, brain failure was the first failure in 18% (4/22) of PCI (+) versus 45% (10/22) of PCI (-) (p = .04). Survival at 2 years was 42% for PCI (+) versus 13% for PCI (-) (p less than .05). When the analysis was limited to those patients permanently controlled in the thorax; there were 25% (4/16) brain failures PCI (+) versus 70% (7/10) PCI (-) (p = .03). For this same subset the 2-year survival was 56% PCI (+) versus 14% PCI (-) (p less than .05). There were no 5 year survivors without PCI compared to 38% (6/16) with PCI. These data suggest that PCI appears to be effective in enhancing survival of patients who achieve durable thoracic control. Prospective trials are necessary to evaluate the use of PCI combined with therapeutic regimens with a documented ability to achieve high rates of sustained control of thoracic disease.",Excluded

Recent data established the prospective applications for fullerenol (C<inf>60</inf>(OH)<inf>24</inf>) nanoparticle (FNP) in many fields, such as antioxidants, neuroprotective agents, and potential anti-radiation drugs. Leukemia cell sensitization to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation is achieved by upregulation of ROS production and/or downregulation of antioxidative enzymes. Therefore, our aim was to analyze the potential role of fullerenol nanoparticle in modulation of the leukemic cellular response to irradiation. We used the qRT-PCR to analyze the expression level of mRNA for 11 genes in irradiated (IR) and FNP pre-treated irradiated cells (FNP + IR) K562 cells, and compared gene expression level with the overall cell survival, determined by DET and MTT assays. Interesting result of similar percentage of cell survival in FNP and FNP + IR groups (67.9% versus 63%), indicated the possible protective effect of FNP in irradiated cells. Under oxidative stress induced by radiation, cytoprotective genes such as GSTA4, MnSOD, NOS, CAT and HO-1 were upregulated in FNP pretreated K562 cells in comparison with control group, IR and FNP - treated non-irradiated cells. Amongst the antioxidative enzymes, only the mRNA of Cu, Zn - SOD (SOD-1) was downregulated, while gGT, GPX and GSTP1 were not significantly modulated in FNP-treated irradiated cells. Together with survival data and significant overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL genes, our results may indicate that FNP exerts cytoprotective function in K562 leukemic cells, rendering K562 cells more tolerant to radiotherapy.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: The purpose is to describe the method, safety and efficacy of transperineal gold seed placement for image-guided radiation therapy.METHODS: An ethics committee approved database was used to review records of consecutive patients from October 2008 through December 2013, who underwent transperineal implantation of three gold markers into the prostate using staged local anaesthesia and transrectal ultrasound. Seeds were counted on radiographs from CT simulation, first treatment and last treatment. Retention and use of at least three markers for kV/kV matching was considered a successful implant. A visual analogue scale (VAS) pain assessment was performed. SAS was used for data analysis.RESULTS: Fiducial marker placement was successful for kV/kV matching in 556/581 patients (95.7%). The procedure was aborted due to pain in two patients. Additional sedation during the procedure was required in two patients. Complications include urinary infections (2 patients, <0.5%) and transient haematuria (2 patients, <0.5%). There were no recorded calls requesting additional pain medication or delays in radiation due to complications. The number of seeds identified at simulation: 4 (2 patients), 3 (554 patients), 2 (21 patients), 1 (1 patient), 0 (1 patient). One patient with three seeds and two patients with <2 seeds had cone beam CT instead of kV/kV imaging for image guidance. No seeds were lost after simulation. The mean visual analogue pain score associated with transperineal gold seed insertion met patients' expectations (respectively 4.1 vs. 4.4 P = 0.19).CONCLUSION: Outpatient transperineal insertion of fiducials avoids the rectum, is effective, convenient, well tolerated and has few side effects.",Excluded

Heavy ion RT has been used in the treatment of various tumours, especially for radioresistant tumours mediated by hypoxia, localized near organs at risk. Most of these treatments are concentrated in deep-seated tumours such as those of the brain, head, lung, liver, rectum and urogenital organs, and treatment of skin carcinomas is limited.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcome and toxicity after carbon ion RT for skin carcinomas at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou, China.METHODS: Between November 2006 and March 2009, 45 patients with skin carcinoma [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n = 16), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (n = 12), malignant melanoma (MM) (n = 7), Bowen disease (n = 8) and Paget disease (n = 2)] were treated with carbon ion RT within a clinical Phase I trial. Patients received total doses of 60-70 GyE for SCC and BCC, 61-75 GyE for MM, 60 GyE for Bowen disease and 42.5 GyE for Paget disease, administered in 6-11 fractions over 6-11 days, with a fraction dose of 7-10 GyE.RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 24 months, range 12-36 months.

3994,"Arachidonic acid potentiates acid-sensing ion channels in rat sensory neurons by a direct action. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are activated by a decrease in extracellular pH. ASICs are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons, and several lines of evidence suggest that they are responsible for signaling the pain caused by extracellular acidification, but little is understood of the modulation of ASICs by pro-inflammatory factors. Using whole-cell patch clamp we demonstrate that low pH evokes three distinct inward currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons: a slowly inactivating transient current, a rapidly inactivating transient current, and a sustained current. All three currents were potentiated by arachidonic acid (AA), to 123%, 171%, and 264% of peak current, respectively. Membrane stretch had no effect on proton-gated currents, implying that AA is unlikely to act via local membrane deformation. The current carried by heterologously expressed ASIC1a and ASIC3 was also potentiated by AA. AA potentiates ASIC activation by a direct mechanism, because inhibition of AA metabolism had no effect on potentiation, and potentiation of single ASIC2a channels could be observed in cell-free patches. Potentiation by lipids with the same chain length as AA increased as the number of double bonds was increased. AA is known to be released in inflammation and the results suggest that AA may be an important pro-inflammatory agent responsible for enhancing acid-mediated pain.",Excluded
4562,"c-Abl is required for development and optimal cell proliferation in the context of p53 deficiency. The c-Abl tyrosine kinase and the p53 tumor suppressor protein interact functionally and biochemically in cellular genotoxic stress response pathways and are implicated as downstream mediators of ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated). This fact led us to study genetic interactions in vivo between c-Abl and p53 by examining the phenotype of mice and cells deficient in both proteins. c-Abl-null mice show high neonatal mortality and decreased B lymphocytes, whereas p53-null mice are prone to tumor development. Surprisingly, mice doubly deficient in both c-Abl and p53 are not viable, suggesting that c-Abl and p53 together contribute to an essential function required for normal development. Fibroblasts lacking both c-Abl and p53 were similar to fibroblasts deficient in p53 alone, showing loss of the G(1)/S cell-cycle checkpoint and similar clonogenic survival after ionizing radiation. Fibroblasts deficient in both c-Abl and p53 show reduced growth in culture, as manifested by reduction in the rate of proliferation, saturation density, and colony formation, compared with fibroblasts lacking p53 alone. This defect could be restored by reconstitution of c-Abl expression. Taken together, these results indicate that the ATM phenotype cannot be explained solely by loss of c-Abl and p53 and that c-Abl contributes to enhanced proliferation of p53-deficient cells. Inhibition of c-Abl function may be a therapeutic strategy to target p53-deficient cells selectively.",Excluded

Purpose: To investigate the capabilities and characteristics of helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in sparing the Bilateral hippocampal tissues (BHT) during prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Method(s): HT and VMAT treatment plans were generated with a prescription dose of 30Gy/10 fractions in 16 patients treated with PCI. The dosimetry parameters of BHT, organs at risk (OARs), and planning target volume (PTV) were determined when the average dose of BHT was reduced by about 4Gy to serve as an observation point. Statistical plots were used to present dosimetry changing trends when sparing the BHT with both HT and VMAT technologies. Result(s): HT plans spared BHT V7.3Gy by up to 40%, with the average Dmean-BHT = 8.42+/-0.41Gy, while VMAT plans failed to spare BHT V7.3Gy by such an amount. HT authored significantly lower doses to OARs, including Dmean-BHT (HT 16.37Gy vs. VMAT 17.81Gy, P=0.03), Dmean-inner ear (P=0.02), Dmean-parotid glands (P=0.02), Dmax-lens (P=0.02), and Dmax-brainstem (P=0.02), except for Dmax-optic nerves (P=0.87), compared to VMAT. Also, compared to VMAT, HT plans provided better target coverage, with lower average D2% (P=0.02), higher average D98% (P=0.02), and better conformal index (0.87 vs. 0.84, P=0.02) and homogeneity index (0.15 vs. 0.21, P=0.05). With smaller BHT doses, the dose distribution to PTV occurred in three dosimetry regions for both HT and VMAT plans; the plateau region (>20.0Gy for HT vs >16.0Gy for VMAT), gradient region (20.0-12.0Gy vs 16.0-11.0Gy), and falling region (<12.0Gy vs <11.0Gy). The average delivery duration for HT was determined at almost 7.7 times longer than VMAT. Conclusion(s): Compared to VMAT, HT was better at sparing the BHT and OARs and had better target coverage but much longer treatment duration. More BHT dose decreases would yield worse target dose coverage, which would present a 'three regions' stair-stepping characteristic.",Excluded
4761,"Radiation-induced DNA damage in tumors and normal tissues. II. Influence of dose, residual DNA damage and physiological factors in oxygenated cells. Detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors is important for many experimental and clinical situations. Several laboratories, including ours, have suggested that assays which measure radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) might be used to detect or quantify hypoxic cells in tumors and normal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of using an alkaline elution assay that measures strand breaks and DPCs to detect and/or quantify hypoxic cells in tissues. For this approach to be valid, DPCs must not be formed to any great extent in irradiated oxygenated cells, and the formation and repair of strand breaks and DPCs in oxygenated cells must not be modified appreciably by physiological factors (e.g. temperature, pH and nutrient depletion) that are often found in solid tumors. To address these issues, two sets of experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, oxygenated 9L cells in tissue culture, subcutaneous 9L tumors and rat cerebella were irradiated with doses of 15 or 50 Gy and allowed to repair until the residual strand break damage was low enough to detect DPCs. In another set of experiments, oxygenated exponentially growing or plateau-phase 9L cells in tissue culture were irradiated with a dose of 15 Gy at 37 or 20 degrees C, while the cells were maintained at a pH of either 6.6 or 7.3. DNA-protein crosslinks were formed in oxygenated cells about 100 times less efficiently than in hypoxic cells. In addition, temperature, pH, nutrient depletion and growth phase did not appreciably alter the formation and repair of strand breaks or the formation of DPCs in oxygenated 9L cells. These results support the use of this DNA damage assay for the detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors.",Included

Whether regeneration is accomplished by pluripotent cells or by the collective activity of multiple lineage-restricted cell types is unknown. We used ionizing radiation and single-cell transplantation to identify neoblasts that can form large descendant-cell colonies in vivo. These clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) produce cells that differentiate into neuronal, intestinal, and other known postmitotic cell types and are distributed throughout the body. Single transplanted cNeoblasts restored regeneration in lethally irradiated hosts.

We assessed the e fficacy of a two-drug induction regimen, followed by transoral robotic assisted surgery (TORS) & neck dissection for locally advanced OPSCC. Method(s): This is an IRB approved single-arm phase II study for untreated stage III or IVA OPSCC patients (pts) with an ECOG < 2 and GFR > 50 cc. Induction chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and taxotere 75 mg/m2 every 21 days for 3 cycles. Tumor shrinkage was examined after each cycle. If the primary tumor was > 80% smaller, pts underwent TORS and neck dissection(s). At post-op visits, flexible laryngoscopy, blood work, and imaging with PET/CT and/or MRI were done. Short and long term toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated. Result(s): Nineteenpts were treated and 14 are available for analysis. Thirteen were male, 12 were Caucasian, 2 were African-American, and 13 were HPV+. Median age at diagnosis was 57. Tumors involved the tonsil (11 pts) and base of tongue (3 pts). Three pts were stage III, and 11 were stage IVA. Tumor size was reduced on average by 58%, 84% and 92% after the 1st, 2 and 3 induction cycles respectively. Pathologic complete remission of primary disease occurred in 11 pts and in 7 pts with cervical lymph node disease.

4223,"[Histochemical and ultrastructural studies on anti-edematous and radiation-protective action of 0-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutosides on the rat brain after single irradiation. 2. Histochemical study on carbohydrate metabolism and acid phosphatase activation]. The disturbances of the carbohydrate metabolism and the activation of acid phosphatases with and without protection by O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside (HR) were studied in irradiated rat brains by means of the light microscope. The histochemically demonstrable deposition of glycogen and acid mucopolysaccharides serves as a criterion for a reversible lesion of the irradiated cerebral tissue. The extent of local activation of repair processes following to irradiation can be determined by the quantity of acid phosphatases in the lysosomes. For the dose range of 1 to 5 Gy, HR seems to exert a protective effect on the cellular metabolism of the irradiated cerebral tissue shown by a slight decrease of glycogen and mucopolysaccharide deposits compared to the untreated animals. However, when exceeding a threshold dose of 10 Gy, the deposition of carbohydrates in the HR group is strongly increased. A slightly increased activity of acid phosphatases induced by HR can be supposed at best for the dose range of 5 to 7.5 Gy. If the dose is even more increased, the reverse effect found in the carbohydrate metabolism, too, and an increased activation of acid phosphatases in the control group will be observed. This unexpected reversion of the protective effect could be related to the assumed inhibitory effect of HR on the ATPases and thus on the anaerobic part of glycolysis or to a breakdown of the cell interaction system of endothelial cells, glia cells, and neurons.",Included

3813,"Expert opinion paper on cardiac imaging after ischemic stroke. This expert opinion paper on cardiac imaging after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) includes a statement of the ""Heart and Brain"" consortium of the German Cardiac Society and the German Stroke Society. The Stroke Unit-Commission of the German Stroke Society and the German Atrial Fibrillation NETwork (AFNET) endorsed this paper. Cardiac imaging is a key component of etiological work-up after stroke. Enhanced echocardiographic tools, constantly improving cardiac computer tomography (CT) as well as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer comprehensive non- or less-invasive cardiac evaluation at the expense of increased costs and/or radiation exposure. Certain imaging findings usually lead to a change in medical secondary stroke prevention or may influence medical treatment. However, there is no proof from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that the choice of the imaging method influences the prognosis of stroke patients. Summarizing present knowledge, the German Heart and Brain consortium proposes an interdisciplinary, staged standard diagnostic scheme for the detection of risk factors of cardio-embolic stroke. This expert opinion paper aims to give practical advice to physicians who are involved in stroke care. In line with the nature of an expert opinion paper, labeling of classes of recommendations is not provided, since many statements are based on expert opinion, reported case series, and clinical experience.",Excluded
4790,"Changes in the readily releasable pool of transmitter and in efficacy of release induced by high-frequency firing at Aplysia sensorimotor synapses in culture. Synaptic transmission at the sensory neuron-motor neuron synapses of Aplysia, like transmission at many synapses of both vertebrates and invertebrates, is increased after a short burst of high-frequency stimulation (HFS), a phenomenon known as posttetanic potentiation (PTP). PTP is generally attributable to an increase in transmitter release from presynaptic neurons. We investigated whether changes in the readily releasable pool of transmitter (RRP) contribute to the potentiation that follows HFS. We compared the changes in excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked with action potentials to changes in the RRP as estimated from the asynchronous transmitter release elicited by a hypertonic solution. The changes in the EPSP were correlated with changes in the RRP, but the changes matched quantitatively only at connections whose initial synaptic strength was greater than the median for all experiments. At weaker connections, the increase in the RRP was insufficient to account for PTP. Weaker connections initially released a smaller fraction of the RRP with each EPSP than stronger ones, and this fraction increased at weaker connections after HFS. Moreover, the initial transmitter release in response to the hypertonic solution was accelerated after HFS, indicating that the increase in the efficacy of release was not restricted to excitation-secretion coupling. Modulation of the RRP and of the efficacy of release thus both contribute to the enhancement of transmitter release by HFS.",Excluded

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine the severity and development of breast and arm symptoms separately during the two years following breast cancer surgery, and to examine whether previously defined predictors of arm symptoms are associated with breast symptoms.DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with two-year follow-up.SETTING: Three institutions in the Stockholm, Sweden, region.SAMPLE: 645 women, aged 20-63 years, enrolled within 12 weeks of surgery for primary breast cancer.METHODS: Baseline register and questionnaire data with five follow-ups were submitted to descriptive, inferential, and logistic regression analysis.MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Severity of breast and arm symptoms measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer breast cancer-specific quality-of-life questionnaire.FINDINGS: Most participants had undergone breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node dissection, and were scheduled for postoperative radiation therapy. Overall mean levels of breast and arm symptoms were low, but with large individual variations. At all six time points, the mean levels of breast symptoms were significantly higher than those of arm symptoms. Overall, the mean level of both types of symptoms decreased during follow-up. A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater and breast symptoms at eight months were associated with having breast symptoms at two years. Arm symptoms at baseline and at eight months, and radiation therapy and a BMI of 25 or greater were associated with having arm symptoms at two years.CONCLUSIONS: Breast symptoms show different patterns of change and are not associated with the same factors as arm symptoms.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: For nurses monitoring women treated for breast cancer, the results of this study provide knowledge regarding the importance of early symptom identification and long-term symptoms after treatment.",Excluded

Survival outcome of 1592 analyzable patients on four Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) studies in inoperable non-small cell lung cancer were studied utilizing a recursive partitioning analysis (RPA). This approach creates a regression tree according to prognostic variables which partitions into homogenous subsets according to survival. Four protocols, RTOG 83-11, 83-21, 84-03 and 84-07 were analyzed. 83-11 and 84-07 were studies utilizing irradiation with 'alterfractionation; 83-21 and 84-03 were studies evaluating thymocin with irradiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation with thoracic irradiation respectively. Nine pretreatment variables and one treatment variable were analyzed. Adjustment for radiotherapy effect was made in the accelerated treatment protocol (84-07). Overall, median survival for the entire group was 9.0 months with 17% alive at 2 years. Univariate analysis suggests that KPS, <=70 vs. 80-100, pleural effusion, weight loss, <=5% vs. 5%, age, 60 + vs. < 60, T stage (T1 and T2 vs. T3 and T4) and N stage (N- vs. N +) were important prognastic factors. Radiation dose, sex, race and histology were not univariate prognastic factors. RPA identified KPS as the most significant covariate (median survival 5.9 mos. <= 70 vs. 9.9 mos. 80-100). Within KPS 80-100 other splits occurred for N stage, age, weight loss and radiation therapy dose. KPS 170 split at pleural effusion only. The best overall RPA tree has four distinct classes with median survival times ranging from 3.3 to 12.6 months. The RPA classes were validated in an independent non-small cell lung cancer dataset. This analysis may allow more intelligent stratification and study-design for future RTOG trials in inoperable non-small cell lung cancer.",Excluded

Knowledge of the cellular mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of stimulation and the optimal doses of such stimulation to maximize neuronal recovery is essential to guide clinical practice in neural rehabilitation. Using hamsters, we transected the optic nerve to demonstrate how light stimulation affects neuronal recovery. The c-fos protein was used as a neuronal connectivity marker. Here we show that: (a) in addition to cell death, a population of cells undergoes synaptic deafferentation and (b) light stimulation delays cell death and deafferentation. Among the three rearing conditions studied (6:18LD, 12:12LD, and 18:6LD), the 12:12LD condition appears to be the one achieving the optimal therapeutic effect.

We diagnosed this clinical situation as primary hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function returned to normal and the palpitation ceased 1 month after treatment with thiamazole. Plasma BNP concentration decreased but remained slightly high for 4 months and returned to the normal range 11 months after admission. M-mode echocardiogram showed normal contraction of the left ventricular wall throughout the clinical course, and mitral inflow velocity by pulsed Doppler method showed the E >A pattern on admission and an abnormal relaxation pattern 4 months after admission. Cyclic variation of integrated backscatter (IB) value in the left ventricular posterior wall was small at time of admission (3.6 dB), had increased 4 months later (7.7 dB), and was close to the normal range 11 months toper admission (8.7 dB).

BACKGROUND: Reports of cases diagnosed as Moyamoya disease (MMD) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are extremely rare. In recent years, ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) has been identified as a susceptibility gene of MMD, but the mechanism by which MMD develops remains unclear. Those cases of de novo development of MMD may provide some clues to clarify the mechanism of progression of MMD.CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of de novo MMD that developed after SRS for AVM. This patient presented with a variant of the RNF213 gene. The intracranial internal carotid artery was not within the irradiation field; therefore it was obvious that the development of MMD was not caused by the direct effect of radiation in the current case study. Moreover, we demonstrated the decrease in velocity in the internal carotid artery prior to the development of MMD using phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography. Previous studies demonstrated that progression of the pathological condition in the cerebral arteries in response to hemodynamic changes is enhanced in patients with RNF213 variants.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the changes in the intracranial hemodynamics after SRS for AVM could trigger the de novo onset of MMD in patients with a genetic predisposition for the RNF213 variant.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: Therapeutical approach in brain metastases still remains the major problem in many cancer patients, especially in those with primary lung lesion. The aim of the present study was to test the tolerance to a whole brain telegammatherapy with a daily dose of 2 Gy in patients with lung cancer, to evaluate the improvement of sensory and motor deficits, and to define the more appropriate total dose (20 or 30 Gy) with regard to the patient survival.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty nine patients with lung cancer and verified brain metastases underwent a whole brain telegammatherapy to a total dose of 20-30 Gy. Solitary metastases were found in 45 percent of the patients but all were defined as inoperable cases. The other patients had two or more brain lesions.RESULTS: All patients tolerated well the fraction and the total dose. The mean survival of the patients was 6.6 months with confidence interval 5.8-7.4 months. The survival difference between treatments with 20 and 30 Gy total dose did not reach statistical significance.

Efforts have, therefore, been focused on obtaining better results in the treatment of patients with high-risk tumors. In addition to consolidated therapies, novel approaches such as small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, and antiangiogenic therapies that aim to improve outcomes and quality of life are now available through new breakthroughs in the molecular biology of medulloblastoma. The advent of innovative anticancer drugs tested in brain tumors has important consequences for personalized therapy. Gene expression profiling of medulloblastoma can be used to identify the genes and signaling transduction pathways that are crucial for the tumorigenesis process, thereby revealing both new targets for therapy and sensitive/resistance phenotypes. The interpretation of microarray data for new treatments of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma, as well as other poor prognosis tumors, should be developed through a consensus multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiotherapists, biotechnologists, bioinformaticists, and other professionals. © 2007 Adis Data Information BV.

PURPOSE: This pilot prospective study sought to determine whether dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could be used as a clinical imaging biomarker of tissue toxicity from whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).METHOD: 14 patients who received WBRT were imaged using dynamic contrast enhanced DCE-MRI prior to and at 8-weeks, 16-weeks and 24-weeks after the initiation of WBRT. Twelve of the patients were also enrolled in the RTOG 0614 trial, which randomized patients to the use of placebo or memantine. After the unblinding of the treatments received by RTOG 0614 patients, DCE-MRI measures of tumor tissue and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) vascular permeability (Initial Area Under the Curve (AUC) Blood Adjusted) was analyzed. Cognitive, quality-of-life (QOL) assessment and blood samples were collected according to the patient's ability to tolerate the exams. Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) were measured using flow cytometry.RESULTS: Following WBRT, there was an increasing trend in the vascular permeability of tumors (p=0.09) and NAWM (p=0.06) with time. Memantine significantly (p=0.01) reduced NAWM AUC changes following radiotherapy. Patients on memantine retained (COWA p= 0.03) better cognitive functions than those on placebo. No association was observed between the level of CEC and DCE-MRI changes, time from radiotherapy or memantine use.CONCLUSIONS: DCE-MRI can detect vascular damage secondary to WBRT.

Purpose/Objective(s): Currently, there is no consensus fractionation scheme for spine SBRT. We report mature outcomes for a cohort of patients with no prior radiation (de novo) treated with 24 Gy in 2 daily fractions, which represents an emerging Canadian standard. Purpose/Objective(s): The cohort consisted of 279 de novo spinal metastases in 145 consecutive patients treated with 24 Gy in 2 SBRT fractions, between 2009 and 2015, identified from a prospective database. All vertebral segments were treated with an institutionally standardized Linac-based approach using cone-beam CT image guidance and six degrees-of-freedom online setup correction. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), local control (LC), and the rate of vertebral compression fractures (VCF). OS rates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier methods and cumulative incidences of LC and VCF were obtained from competing risk analysis using death as a competing risk event. Evaluation of tumor control was based on serial spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as per the SPIne response assessment in Neuro-Oncology (SPINO) criteria recommendations. Result(s): The median follow-up was 17.0 months (range, 0.1-71.6 months). The 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 73.1% and 60.7%, respectively. Presence of epidural disease (P < 0.0001), lung (P = 0.0415) and renal cell (P < 0.0001) primary histologies and diffuse spinal metastatic disease as opposed to oligometastatic disease (P = 0.0034) were significant prognostic factors. The 1-year and 2-year LC rates were 90.3% and 82.4%, respectively, and the median time to local failure (LF) was 9.2 month (range, 0.4-31.3 months). Only the presence of epidural disease predicted for LF (P < 0.0001). The cumulative risk of VCF at 1 and 2 years were 8.5% and 13.8%, respectively.

The visual photopigment rhodopsin (Rh) is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) responsible for initiation of the phototransduction cascade in rod photoreceptors. Similar to other GPCRs, Rh can form dimers or even higher oligomers and tends to have a supramolecular organization that is likely important in the dim light response. Rh also exhibits high affinity for lipid rafts (i.e. raftophilicity) upon light-dependent binding with the cognate G protein transducin (G<sub>t</sub>), suggesting the presence of lipid raft-like domains in the retinal disk membrane and their importance in phototransduction. However, the relationship between Rh oligomerization and lipid rafts in the disk membrane remains to be explored. Given previous findings that G<sub>t</sub> binds to dimeric Rh and that Rh is posttranslationally modified with two highly raftophilic palmitoyl moieties, we hypothesized that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Here, using biochemical assays, we found that Rh*-G<sub>t</sub> complexes in the detergent-resistant membrane are partially resistant to cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and that the Rh-to-G<sub>t</sub> stoichiometry in this methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-resistant complex is 2:1. Next, we found that IgG-mediated Rh-Rh cross-linking renders Rh highly raftophilic, supporting the premise that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Rh depalmitoylation via reduction of thioester linkages blocked the translocation of IgG-cross-linked Rh to the detergent-resistant membrane, highlighting that the two palmitoyl moieties are important for the dimerization-dependent raftophilicity of Rh. These results indicate that palmitoylated GPCRs such as Rh can acquire raftophilicity upon G protein-stabilized dimerization and thereby organize receptor-cluster rafts by recruiting raftophilic lipids.",Excluded

Method(s): A Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS (Open 20RT) was used in this study for treatment planning CT simulation of all head and neck patients since January 2018. The DECT scanner allowed for sequential acquisition of two image datasets at 80 kVp and 140 kVp with the same acquisition time and radiation dose as a conventional single-energy scan. Images were reconstructed for nominal monoenergies of 40 keV, 100 keV and 190 keV, and a mixed energy of 120 kVp, which is equivalent to that currently used in routine simulation scanning. The reconstructed images were compared using the Varian VelocityAI software with a focus on the anatomical appearance of the lymph nodes and primary tumor sites. Result(s): Our data showed that there were clinically significant differences in DECT images at different nominal energies. At 40 keV, enhancement of the tumor was more clearly seen compared with CT images at 120 kVp, 100 keV and 190 keV. More significant differences were also found at the border and necrotic area of nodes using different energies. For most patients the 40 keV CT images showed more enhanced tumor areas surrounding the vessels compared with images at 120 kVp, 100 keV and 190 keV, respectively.

4440,"Increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein in limbic brain regions after amygdala-kindled seizures in rats. Increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB1) has previously been found in epileptogenic brain tissue from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) as well as in the hippocampus and other limbic brain regions in the rat kainate model of TLE. Approaches to the quantification of Pgp expression have mainly been based on subjective visual estimation of the level of Pgp immunoreactivity in brain sections. In the present study, computer-assisted image analysis based on optical density (OD) measurements was used to examine immunohistochemical expression of Pgp in the kindling model of TLE. Sections from kainate-treated rats were used for comparison. Using diaminobenzidine as chromogen, Pgp was exclusively located in brain capillary endothelial cells, which was confirmed by double-labeling with an antibody against the endothelial glucose transporter (GLUT-1). After kainate-induced seizures, the intensity of endothelial Pgp staining significantly increased by 70-80% in the dentate gyrus. A significant, albeit less marked increase in Pgp expression in this area was also seen after amygdala-kindled seizures. Furthermore, Pgp was upregulated after kindling in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, the CA1 and CA3 sectors of the hippocampus, and the piriform and cerebral cortex. In kindled rats, most Pgp alterations occurred ipsilateral to the electrode in the basolateral amygdala. The data demonstrate that computer-assisted image analysis using OD is an accurate and rapid method to determine the relative amount of Pgp protein in brain sections and the effects of seizures on this multidrug transporter. The fact that Pgp overexpression in brain capillary endothelial cells occurs in two established models of difficult-to-treat TLE substantiates the notion that seizure-induced upregulation of Pgp contributes to multidrug resistance (MDR) in epilepsy.",Excluded
3946,"Spatial learning and memory deficits induced by exposure to iron-56-particle radiation. It has previously been shown that exposing rats to particles of high energy and charge (HZE) disrupts the functioning of the dopaminergic system and behaviors mediated by this system, such as motor performance and an amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion; these adverse behavioral and neuronal effects are similar to those seen in aged animals. Because cognition declines with age, spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/nucleon high-energy (56)Fe particles, to test the cognitive behavioral consequences of radiation exposure. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment compared to the control group as seen in their increased latencies to find the hidden platform, particularly on the reversal day when the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant. Also, the irradiated group used nonspatial strategies during the probe trials (swim with no platform), i.e. less time spent in the platform quadrant, fewer crossings of and less time spent in the previous platform location, and longer latencies to the previous platform location. These findings are similar to those seen in aged rats, suggesting that an increased release of reactive oxygen species may be responsible for the induction of radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits. If these decrements in behavior also occur in humans, they may impair the ability of astronauts to perform critical tasks during long-term space travel beyond the magnetosphere.",Included
4292,"GAP-independent termination of photoreceptor light response by excess gamma subunit of the cGMP-phosphodiesterase. We have generated a mouse with rod photoreceptors overexpressing the gamma inhibitory subunit (PDE6gamma) of the photoreceptor G-protein effector cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6). PDE6gamma overexpression decreases the rate of rise of the rod response at dim intensities, indicating a reduction in the gain of transduction that may be the result of cytoplasmic PDE6gamma binding to activated transducin alpha GTP (Talpha-GTP) before the Talpha-GTP binds to endogenous PDE6gamma. Excess PDE6gamma also produces a marked acceleration in the falling phase of the light response and more rapid recovery of sensitivity and circulating current after prolonged light exposure. These effects are not mediated by accelerating GTP hydrolysis through the GAP (GTPase activating protein) complex, because the decay of the light response is also accelerated in rods that overexpress PDE6gamma but lack RGS9. Our results show that the PDE6gamma binding sites of PDE6 alpha and beta are accessible to excess (presumably cytoplasmic) PDE6gamma in the light, once endogenous PDE6gamma has been displaced from its binding site by Talpha-GTP. They also suggest that in the presence of Talpha-GTP, the PDE6gamma remains attached to the rest of the PDE6 molecule, but after conversion of Talpha-GTP to Talpha-GDP, the PDE6gamma may dissociate from the PDE6 and exchange with a cytoplasmic pool. This pool may exist even in wild-type rods and may explain the decay of rod photoresponses in the presence of nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP.",Excluded
4073,"Reduced somatosensory hand representation in thalidomide-induced dysmelia as revealed by fMRI. The concept of cerebral plasticity suggests that the hand representation in somatosensory cortex is abnormal in congenital malformation disorders. To investigate this issue we studied 11 subjects with different degrees of upper extremity dysmelia due to thalidomide embryopathy in comparison to 10 control subjects. In the affected subjects fingers are typically missing in radio-ulnar order beginning with the thumb. Haemodynamic responses to electrical stimulation of the radial-most and ulnar-most fingers were measured in each subject using functional magnetic resonance tomography. The size of the hand area in the primary somatosensory cortex was estimated by calculating the Euclidian distance between corresponding activation peaks on the lateral postcentral gyrus. The cortical somatosensory hand representation was found to be significantly smaller in dysmelic subjects as compared with the control subjects (P <0.001). The shrinkage of the hand area was not proportional to the number of missing fingers. Furthermore, the cortical representation of the ulnar fingers in the dysmelic subjects was shifted towards the cortical thumb representation of the control group. We suggest that the unproportional reduction of the hand area together with the observed shift may reflect use-dependent rather than malformation-induced reorganization of the somatosensory hand area.",Excluded
3927,"Reduction of radiation exposure using low pulse rate fluoroscopy during neuroendovascular surgery. INTRODUCTION: Endovascular surgery is minimally invasive, but the radiation exposure can be problematic. There is no report assessing whether radiation exposure can be reduced by using a low pulse rate during carotid artery stenting (CAS). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether reducing the pulse rate from 7.5 to 4 frames per second (f/s) can reduce the radiation exposure while maintaining safety during CAS procedure.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the radiation data and clinical features of all 100 patients who underwent CAS between 2014 and 2019. We changed the pulse rate from 7.5 to 4 f/s in 2017. The fluoroscopic time (FT), dose area product (DAP), and total air kerma (AK) were collected. Statistical analyses were performed between the pulse rate and clinical outcomes, including radiation exposure.",Excluded
4514,"3D conditional generative adversarial networks for high-quality PET image estimation at low dose. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a widely used imaging modality, providing insight into both the biochemical and physiological processes of human body. Usually, a full dose radioactive tracer is required to obtain high-quality PET images for clinical needs. This inevitably raises concerns about potential health hazards. On the other hand, dose reduction may cause the increased noise in the reconstructed PET images, which impacts the image quality to a certain extent. In this paper, in order to reduce the radiation exposure while maintaining the high quality of PET images, we propose a novel method based on 3D conditional generative adversarial networks (3D c-GANs) to estimate the high-quality full-dose PET images from low-dose ones. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) include a generator network and a discriminator network which are trained simultaneously with the goal of one beating the other. Similar to GANs, in the proposed 3D c-GANs, we condition the model on an input low-dose PET image and generate a corresponding output full-dose PET image. Specifically, to render the same underlying information between the low-dose and full-dose PET images, a 3D U-net-like deep architecture which can combine hierarchical features by using skip connection is designed as the generator network to synthesize the full-dose image. In order to guarantee the synthesized PET image to be close to the real one, we take into account of the estimation error loss in addition to the discriminator feedback to train the generator network. Furthermore, a concatenated 3D c-GANs based progressive refinement scheme is also proposed to further improve the quality of estimated images. Validation was done on a real human brain dataset including both the normal subjects and the subjects diagnosed as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Experimental results show that our proposed 3D c-GANs method outperforms the benchmark methods and achieves much better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.",Excluded
4184,"Autopsy report of a late delayed radiation injury after a period of 45 years. For delayed radiation injury, image analysis has considerably advanced, but neuropathological findings are still required to establish diagnosis. A patient who had received radiation therapy for pineal germinoma at age 14 developed neurological and psychiatric abnormalities after 15 years as a late delayed radiation injury. Autopsy at age 59 revealed diffuse changes in the white matter consisting in order of severity of myelin pallor, demyelination, and necrosis which were characterized by a lack of glial reaction. The cerebral cortex was relatively well preserved. As delayed radiation injuries, hyalinous changes in the vascular wall, angiomatous lesions and, fresh and old petechial hemorrhages were found. Moreover, vascular changes associated with arteriosclerosis were also present. Furthermore, a focal glial nodule was detected which was considered to be a new radiation-induced neoplasia. These findings suggest that late delayed radiation injury may slowly develop over 30 years and may involve damage to neuroglial stem cell compensation. It is also evident that arteriosclerotic changes and newly induced neoplasia may develop in delayed radiation injury cases.",Excluded
3747,"Pituitary toxicity but lack of rat colon carcinogenicity of a DC-magnetic field in a medium-term bioassay. The present study was designated to evaluate the effect of direct current induced permanent magnetic field (DC-MF) on chemically induced rat colon carcinogenesis. Five experimental groups of male S.D. rats were injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) subcutaneously, 20 mg/kg b.wt., once a week for four weeks, with exposure to 1 mT DC-MF (12 hours/day) as follows: Before (pre) the carcinogen administration (group 1), simultaneously (group 2), after (post) the carcinogen administration (group 3) and daily from the beginning to the end of the experiment after 12 weeks (group 4). Rats of group 5 served as carcinogen-only treated controls while those of group 6 were non-treated controls. There were no differences in the incidences and multiplicities of colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF), putative preneoplastic lesions, among all groups except that large foci in group 1 were significantly fewer in numbers than those found in group 5. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling indexes (PCNA-LI) in the colon epithelium were essentially the same in MF-treated and control rats. Histopathological examination showed evident hemorrhage in the pituitary glands of some rats of groups 1-3, and in most rats of group 4. Transmission electron microscopy also revealed ultrastructural changes, but DNA ploidy analysis revealed no carcinogenicity to MF-exposed pituitary glands. Serum levels of AST, ALT, total protein, creatinine, albumin, albumin/globulin ratio and growth hormone levels did not change among the groups. The present study revealed that the action of an artificial MF on rats is not carcinogenic/or cancer-promoting, at least in the present protocol for colon carcinogenesis.",Excluded
3685,Late neoplastic complications after radiation treatments for benign intracranial tumors. There is increasing interest in the use of radiation treatment as an adjunct or an alternative to microsurgery in the management of a range of intracranial tumors. Most of these treatments are performed with linear accelerator or Gamma Knife systems. Precise targeting with stereotactic localization minimizes the volume of tissue being irradiated for single and multiple fraction irradiation. The incidence of secondary neoplasms after radiosurgery may be significantly less than that reported after whole-brain or two- or three-field radiotherapy. [References: 19],Excluded

4830,"Patient dosimetric evaluation in angiography practice: Application in interventional neuroradiology. Purpose: To evaluate the risk of a deterministic skin injury from Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures, the Peak Skin Dose (PSD) and the skin dose mapping should be estimate. Dose metrics commonly available such as cumulative air kerma at the interventional reference point (Ka,irp) are usually employed. However, as the PSD may be substantially different from Ka,irp, it is necessary to estimate the PSD and skin dose mapping more accurately. Material(s) and Method(s): A custom made MatLab code has been developed; its output is the PSD and a visual display of the surface dose mapped onto a spherical or cylindrical phantom modeling the head or the trunk of the patient respectively. The code works by translating the Ka,irp (corrected by back-scatter factor) to the location of the patient's skin, represented by a surface of the geometrical model and using dosimetric and geometric parameters (primary and secondary angles of the two tubes, longitudinal displacement of the bed) for each radiation event stored in the radiation dose structured report (RDSR). The setting of the dimension of the geometrical phantom depends on the anatomical size of the patient measured from images stored during IR procedures. To validate the code, arrays of thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were placed on the phantom surface and on the skin of 9 patients undergoing neuroendovascular treatments, both cerebral and spinal (Artis zee biplane, Siemens). Result(s): The Ka,irp provided by the Angiography System overestimates the measured PSD by more than 50% for head treatments. The percent difference between the PSD calculated and measured by TLD is within 35%. The skin dose mapped on the surface of the geometrical model is in agreement with the dose distribution measured by TLD. Conclusion(s): In Neuro-IR, the use of more detailed information from RDSR can improve the accuracy of the calculated PSD. The implemented algorithm can be applied to evaluate the PSD and skin dose mapping without direct dosimetry. Copyright © 2016",Excluded
4764,"Acute effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic field emitted by mobile phone on brain function. Due to its attributes, characteristics, and technological resources, the mobile phone (MP) has become one of the most commonly used communication devices. Historically, ample evidence has ruled out the substantial short-term impact of radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) emitted by MP on human cognitive performance. However, more recent evidence suggests potential harmful effects associated with MP EMF exposure. The aim of this review is to readdress the question of whether the effect of MP EMF exposure on brain function should be reopened. We strengthen our argument focusing on recent neuroimaging and electroencephalography studies, in order to present a more specific analysis of effects of MP EMF exposure on neurocognitive function. Several studies indicate an increase in cortical excitability and/or efficiency with EMF exposure, which appears to be more prominent in fronto-temporal regions and has been associated with faster reaction time. Cortical excitability might also underpin disruption to sleep. However, several inconsistent findings exist, and conclusions regarding adverse effects of EMF exposure are currently limited. It also should be noted that the crucial scientific question of the effect of longer-term MP EMF exposure on brain function remains unanswered and essentially unaddressed.

3770,"Relationship between histologic features and outcomes of carotid revascularization for radiation-induced stenosis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between preoperative carotid imaging results, histologic characteristics, and surgical treatment outcomes of radiation-induced carotid stenosis (RICS), using control subjects without RICS for comparison.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 17 patients who underwent carotid revascularization for 22 instances of RICS, including 10 cases of carotid artery stenting (CAS), 11 cases of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and 1 case of CEA with retrograde CAS, between July 2004 and April 2013. The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.RESULTS: Vulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group. All three cases of late ipsilateral stroke displayed vulnerable plaque on preoperative MRI and late in-stent thrombosis or restenosis on US.CONCLUSIONS: Our radiologic and histologic analyses revealed that advanced RICS is often accompanied by formation of vulnerable plaque. CEA can prevent undesirable late outcomes in such cases.",Included
4478,"Differential expression of KCC2 accounts for the differential GABA responses between relay and intrinsic neurons in the early postnatal rat olfactory bulb. The rat olfactory bulb is anatomically immature at birth, and considerable neurogenesis and synaptogenesis are known to take place postnatally. In addition, significant physiological changes have also been reported in this period. For example, granule cell-mediated inhibition following electrical stimulations to the lateral olfactory tract is robust during the first postnatal week, and then decreases abruptly after the second week. However, the mechanism underlying this enhanced inhibition remains to be elucidated. To know the cause of this phenomenon, we investigated the expression patterns of cation-Cl(-) co-transporters (KCC1, KCC2 and NKCC1) mRNAs, which are responsible for the regulation of [Cl(-)](i). In addition, responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were measured by gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings and Ca(2+) imaging using fura-2. We found that in the early postnatal period, mitral cells expressing KCC2 mRNA were inhibited by GABA, while granule cells lacking KCC2 mRNA expression were depolarized or excited by GABA. These results indicate that transient GABA-mediated excitation on granule cells might be the main cause of the enhanced inhibition on mitral cells, and suggest that these differential GABA responses between relay and intrinsic neurons play pivotal roles in the early postnatal rat olfactory bulb.",Excluded
4575,"Use of the dog spleen for studying effects of irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents, with suggested uses of other organs. The irradiation of the exteriorized spleen of the dog, with the animal lead-shielded, produced constant changes in the white blood cells. The time of recovery from the irradiation effect was determined. The normal canine spleen could handle live pneumococci injected into the splenic artery, as proven by sterile cultures of splenic vein samples. The size of the bolus used was determined by repeated trials and proved to be one billion pneumococci per pound of body weight. The capacity of the irradiated spleen to handle this number of pneumococci was impaired. It was found that whole body irradiation, nitrogen mustard, thio-tepa, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine, and azothioprine all impaired this capacity of the spleen. The dose of the chemotherapeutic agent was the same in milligrams per kilogram as that used in the cancer clinic. A method for determining the recovery time following the use of one or more agents was developed with the repeated use of the spleen model. By extending the methods used with the spleen it was found that similar use could be made, usually without surgery, of the liver, gut, and lungs (and probably the kidney and brain).",Excluded

Environmental epigenetics is the study of how exposures interact with the epigenome to cause stable epigenetic change, most notably changes in DNA methylation patterns. Here we asked whether the response of the mouse epigenome to ionizing radiation is specific or non-specific. We used meDIP-seq to examine radiation-induced changes in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) throughout the genome. To examine tissue specificity, we compared the methylomes of heart and brain tissue 22 weeks after exposure to protons. We found 5mC and 5hmC changes that mapped to genes with cardiovascular functions in the heart and with neuronal functions in the brain. We also compared two forms of ionizing radiation, the sparsely ionizing protons and densely ionizing 56Fe ions. Both are components of galactic cosmic radiation, which is a concern for astronauts flying deep space missions. Specifically, we asked whether protons and 56Fe ions would produce similar DNA methylation changes in the brain at 4 weeks post exposure, and found significant overlap for both 5mC and 5hmC changes. Interestingly, gene expression changes in the brain at 4 weeks were linked to changes in 5hmC at promoter regions, but not 5mC, and these linked changes mapped to neuronal ontology pathways. Further, a novel form of 5hmC change along gene bodies was observed and mapped mostly to postsynaptic pathways. Finally, the extent of 56Fe ion-induced behavioral change correlated inversely with DNA methylation change suggesting that the epigenomic response to radiation was part of the repair process to mitigate its toxic effects.",Included

4685,"Energy dependence on discharge mode of Izhikevich neuron driven by external stimulus under electromagnetic induction. Energy supply plays a key role in metabolism and signal transmission of biological individuals, neurons in a complex electromagnetic environment must be accompanied by the absorption and release of energy. In this paper, the discharge mode and the Hamiltonian energy are investigated within the Izhikevich neuronal model driven by external signals in the presence of electromagnetic induction. It is found that multiple electrical activity modes can be observed by changing external stimulus, and the Hamiltonian energy is more dependent on the discharge mode. In particular, there is a distinct shift and transition in the Hamiltonian energy when the discharge mode is switched quickly. Furthermore, the amplitude of periodic stimulus signal has a greater effect on the neuronal energy compared to the angular frequency, and the average Hamiltonian energy decreases when the discharge rhythm becomes higher. Based on the principle of energy minimization, the system should choose the minimum Hamiltonian energy when maintaining various trigger states to reduce the metabolic energy of signal processing in biological systems. Therefore, our results give the possible clues for predicting and selecting appropriate parameters, and help to understand the sudden and paroxysmal mechanisms of epilepsy symptoms.

A median dose was 60 Gy. Concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to 111 patients. MIB-1 LI was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Recurrence patterns were categorized according to the areas of recurrence as follows: central failure (recurrence in the 95% of 60 Gy); in-field (recurrence in the high-dose volume of 50 Gy; marginal (recurrence outside the high-dose volume) and distant (recurrence outside the RT field). Result(s): The median follow-up durations were 13 months for all patients and 19 months for those remaining alive. Among AA patients, the 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 23.1% and 39.2%, respectively, while in GB patients, the rates were 13.3% and 27.6%, respectively. The median survival time was 20 months for AA patients and 15 months for GB patients. Among AA patients, recurrences were central in 68.7% of patients; in-field, 18.8%; and distant, 12.5%, while among GB patients, 69.0% of recurrences were central, 15.5% were in-field, 12.1% were marginal, and 3.4% were distant. The MIB-1 LI medians were 18.2% in AA and 29.8% in GB.

Histology revealed mild atherosclerosis, necrotizing vasculitis, and occlusive thrombosis of the internal carotid artery. Significant changes were observed in the vasa vasorum: swelling and detachment of the endothelium, subendothelial oedema, hyaline change, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls with mononuclear cellular infiltration, accompanied by focal haemorrhages and chronic inflammation in the periadventitial soft tissue. We believe that these changes of the vasa vasorum and necrotizing vasculitis are causally related and that vasculitis represents focal ischaemic necroses with inflammatory reaction. Our findings support the hypothesis, based on experimental studies, that injury to the vasa vasorum is an important mechanism in the development of radiation-induced vasculopathy of large arteries. They also suggest an evolution of the injury to the vasa vasorum and periadventitial tissue from the early lesions described in our patient, to late stages resulting in dense periadventitial fibrosis as reported previously.

Gross lesions of the axial skeleton were not identified. Gross examination of the brain and spinal cord was unremarkable. The pituitary gland was grossly enlarged and nodular. The brain and partial spinal cord were fixed in 10% formalin for 21 days. Result(s): Microscopic examination of brain sections revealed diffuse leptomeningeal involvement by CD138+, lambda-restricted malignant plasma cells. The cerebellum demonstrated myeloma cells tracking into perivascular spaces of the parenchyma. The pituitary showed near replacement of the neurohypophysis with myeloma.

CNS myelomatosis is rare, with a 1% estimated incidence. It has been reported in patients with presumed complete remission of disease; several cases reported in patients who are post ASCT. CNS involvement of multiple myeloma has an invariably poor prognosis, and there is no standardized treatment approach. Due to prior case reports of CNS involvement in presumed disease remission following ASCT and the present case with its acute and fulminant presentation, diagnostic suspicion of CNS involvement by myeloma should be routinely considered in patients with a history of myeloma and new neurologic findings on clinical exam.

Cranial irradiation is associated with long-term cognitive impairments, including deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Not all people exposed to cranial radiation develop cognitive injury, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. There may also be sex differences in susceptibility to develop radiation-induced cognitive injury. The three major human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms are encoded by distinct alleles (epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4). Compared with epsilon3, epsilon4 increases the risk of cognitive impairments following various challenges while epsilon2 provides relative protection. Women are at higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men, particularly those carrying epsilon4. In previous experiments using male and female mice expressing human apoE-isoforms E2, E3 or E4 under the mouse apoE promoter, we showed that cranial irradiation with 137Cs (10 Gy) results in hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments that are sex- and apoE-isoform dependent. 137Cs is a form of irradiation often used in the clinical setting.

The development of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in irradiated acromegaly patients is not well defined.OBJECTIVE: Detailed analysis of spontaneous 24-h GH and prolactin (PRL) secretion in relation to other pituitary functions and serum IGF-I concentrations in an attempt to find criteria for GHD in acromegalic patients with a GH response < 3 microg/l during the insulin tolerance test (ITT).DESIGN: Plasma hormone profiles obtained by 10 min sampling for 24 h in postoperatively irradiated acromegalic patients, compared with patients cured by surgery only and matched healthy controls.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: University setting. Fifteen subjects in each group.OUTCOME MEASURES: GH and PRL secretory parameters quantified by deconvolution, cluster, cosinor and approximate entropy (ApEn) analyses, IGF-I concentrations.RESULTS: Irradiation attenuated pulsatile secretion of GH and PRL, but total PRL secretion was unchanged. GH and PRL secretory regularity were diminished. Circadian timing remained intact. Pulsatile GH secretion and IGF-I were correlated (R = 0.30, P = 0.04). Criteria of pulsatile GH secretion = 12 microg/l/24 h and ApEn = 0.800 separated 12 of 15 irradiated patients from all others.CONCLUSION: Irradiated acromegaly patients with a subnormal GH response to ITT have very limited spontaneous GH secretion, with specific attenuation of the size of GH bursts and a highly irregular pattern, but with retained diurnal properties. These patients are thus likely GH-deficient and might benefit from GH replacement.",Included
3878,"Nongynecologic Findings Seen at Pelvic US. Ultrasonography (US) is frequently the first imaging modality used to examine women with symptoms involving the pelvis. It is widely available and involves no exposure to ionizing radiation. Images can be acquired with a transabdominal, endovaginal, or translabial approach, and the use of video clips and three-dimensional reconstructions can be helpful. US is excellent for assessment of the uterus, ovaries, and adnexa. Occasionally, nongynecologic pelvic diseases arising from the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems and the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces may be detected and can be a source of diagnostic dilemma. US can be helpful not only in the detection but also occasionally in the characterization of such entities. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are useful in complicated cases. In this article, the normal US appearance of the bowel and US signs of bowel disease and specific entities, including appendicitis, diverticular disease, bowel obstruction, appendiceal mucocele, and intestinal tumors, are reviewed. The lower urinary tract is included in the field of view in every pelvic US examination; commonly encountered entities related to the urinary bladder, distal ureter, and urethra are illustrated. In addition to arising in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, pathologic conditions in the pelvis can arise in the peritoneal or extraperitoneal space. Although conditions of the pelvic peritoneal and extraperitoneal spaces are rare, it is important to recognize these entities and distinguish them from the more common gynecologic diseases. Owing to the implications for diagnosis and management, radiologists and other physicians who perform pelvic US should be aware of the spectrum of nongynecologic pathologic entities that can be detected. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2017.",Excluded

To compare the dosimetric differences of dosiology between intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy (IMAT) and dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (dIMRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. CT data from 25 patients treated in our radiotherapy center were selected randomly for this study. For each patient, the IMAT technique and the fixed beam dIMRT technique were accomplished by the simultaneously integrated boost. Dose volume histogram (DVH) data, isodose distribution, monitor units (MUs) and treatment time were compared in the two techniques. There was no significant difference between the IMAT and the dIMRT in dose received by 95% of target volumes (D(95)) (P>0.05). Overall, the mean dose (D(mean)), maximal dose (D(max)) and volume percentage receiving at least of 107% of the prescribed dose (V(107%)) of planning target volume (PTV) for the IMAT were increased slightly ,compared with the dlMRT (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in dosimetric indices of organs at risk (OARs) including spinal cord,optical nerves,lens and temporomandibular joints in the two techniques (P>0.05). Compared with the dlMRI, the D(max) of brain stem for the IMAT was increased slightly (P<0.05). Similar trends was observed for the D(mean) and dose received by 50% of volume (D(50)) of the left and right parotid glands (P<0.05). Healthy tissue (defined as the volume of the body minus PTV,B-P) irradiated from 800 cGy in the IMAT was higher, and that from 1200-4500 cGy was lower compared with the dlMRI (P<0.05).The average number of MUs was reduced by 62.7% per fraction, and the treatment time was on average reduced by 60.1% per fraction in the IMAT compared with the dlMRI. There is a slight difference in dosiology between the two radiotherapy techniques investigated, but they both meet the clinical requirement. Compared with the dIMRT, the IMAT delivers less irradiation to healthy tissue, uses fewer MUs and takes less time during radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",Excluded

3918,"Challenges Conveying Clinical Equipoise and Exploring Patient Treatment Preferences in an Oncology Trial Comparing Active Monitoring with Radiotherapy (ROAM/EORTC 1308). Introduction: Providing balanced information that emphasizes clinical equipoise (i.e., uncertainty regarding the relative merits of trial interventions) and exploring patient treatment preferences can improve informed consent and trial recruitment. Within a trial comparing adjuvant radiotherapy versus active monitoring following surgical resection for an atypical meningioma (ROAM/EORTC-1308), we explored patterns in communication and reasons why health practitioners may find it challenging to convey equipoise and explore treatment preferences. Material(s) and Method(s): Qualitative study embedded within ROAM/EORTC-1308. Data were collected on 40 patients and 18 practitioners from 13 U.K. sites, including audio recordings of 39 patients' trial consultations, 23 patient interviews, and 18 practitioner interviews. Qualitative analysis drew on argumentation theory. Result(s): Practitioners acknowledged the importance of the research question that the trial aimed to answer. However, they often demonstrated a lack of equipoise in consultations, particularly with eligible patients who practitioners believed to be susceptible to side effects (e.g., cognitive impairment) or inconvenienced by radiotherapy. Practitioners elicited but rarely explored patient treatment preferences, especially if a patient expressed an initial preference for active monitoring. Concerns about coercing patients, loss of practitioner agency, and time constraints influenced communication in ways that were loaded against trial participation. Conclusion(s): We identified several challenges that practitioners face in conveying equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences in oncology, and particularly neuro-oncology, trials with distinct management pathways. The findings informed communication about ROAM/EORTC-1308 and will be relevant to enhancing trial communication in future oncology trials. Qualitative studies embedded within trials can address difficulties with communication, thus improving informed consent and recruitment. ROAM/EORTC-1308 RCT: ISRCTN71502099. Implications for Practice: Oncology trials can be challenging to recruit to, especially those that compare treatment versus monitoring. Conveying clinical equipoise and exploring patient treatment preferences can enhance recruitment and patient understanding. This study focused on the challenges that practitioners encounter in trying to use such communication strategies and how practitioners may inadvertently impede patient recruitment and informed decision making. This article provides recommendations to support practitioners in balancing the content and presentation of trial management pathways. The results can inform training to optimize communication, especially for neuro-oncology trials and trials comparing markedly different management pathways. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

4807,"Targeting the NF-E2-related factor 2 pathway: A novel strategy for glioblastoma (Review). Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant subtype among all brain tumors. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an essential component of cellular defense against a variety of endogenous and exogenous stresses. A marked increase in research over the past few decades focusing on Nrf2 and its role in regulating glioblastoma has revealed the potential value of Nrf2 in the treatment of glioblastoma. In the present review, we discuss a novel framework of Nrf2 in the regulation of glioblastoma and the mechanisms regarding the downregulation of Nrf2 in treating glioblastoma. The candidate mechanisms include direct and indirect means. Direct mechanisms target tumor molecular pathways in order to overcome resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, to inhibit proliferation, to block invasion and migration, to induce apoptosis, to promote differentiation, to enhance autophagy and to target glioblastoma stem cells. Indirect mechanisms target the reaction between glioblastoma cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Overall, the value of the Nrf2 pathway in glioblastoma provides a promising opportunity for new approaches by which to treat glioblastoma.",Excluded

3885,"The effect of continuous ELF-MFs on the level of 5-HIAA in the raphe nucleus of the rat. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of continuous extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) with a frequency of 10 Hz and an intensity of 690-720 muT on the level of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) in adult male Wistar rats. A total of 24 adult Wistar male rats were used, and after exposure with an ELF-MF for 15 successive days, all rats in each test were anesthetized with chloral hydrate. Then, they were placed in a stereotaxic frame for surgery and a microdialysis process. Dialysate samples were analyzed to measure the amount of 5-HIAA by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using electrochemical detection. Results showed that ELF-MF exposure for 15 days, 1 h daily, was not effective in altering the level of 5-HIAA. However, ELF-MF exposure for 15 days, 3 h daily, decreased the level of the 5-HIAA in the raphe nucleus. It can be concluded that ELF-MFs affect the serotonergic system and may be used to treat nervous system diseases. This study is an initial step towards helping cure depression using ELF-MFs.",Excluded

4321,"Focal, high dose, and fractionated modified stereotactic radiation therapy for lung carcinoma patients: a preliminary experience. BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiation therapy is highly effective in the treatment of small brain metastases, regardless of the histology. This suggests that small extracranial malignancies may be curable with similar radiation therapy. The authors developed a novel treatment unit for administering such therapy.METHODS: The unit consisted of a linear accelerator (linac), an X-ray simulator (X-S), computed tomography (CT), and a table. The gantry axes of the three machines were coaxial and could be matched by rotating the table. Patients were instructed to perform shallow respiration with oxygen. The motion of the tumor was monitored with the X-S. When the motion was slight enough, the table was rotated to the CT. To include all geometric movement on the CT images, each scan was made while the patient was performing shallow respiration. After the CT positioning, the table was rotated to the linac, and non-coplanar treatment was given. Beginning in October 1994, 45 patients with 23 primary or 43 metastatic lung carcinomas were treated. Radiation doses at the 80% isodose line were 30-75 gray in 5-15 fractions over 1-3 weeks with or without conventional radiation therapy.RESULTS: The treatment was performed with no or minimal adverse acute symptoms. The daily treatment time was short. During a median follow-up of 11 months, local progression occurred in 2 of 66 lesions. Interstitial changes in the lung were limited.CONCLUSIONS: With this unit and procedure, focal radiation therapy similar to stereotactic radiation therapy is possible for extracranial sites. The preliminary experience appeared safe and promising, and further exploration of this approach is warranted.",Excluded

3968,"A method for recording miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the central nervous system suitable for quantal analysis. Quantal analysis of transmitter release is useful in examining presynaptic mechanisms involved in synaptic transmission. However, in central neurons, the presence of multiple synapses makes it difficult to use the traditional quantal analysis, developed for the neuromuscular transmission. We developed a method to minimize these difficulties. Experiments were performed, using the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique, on rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in a hippocampal slice preparation. When the stratum radiatum was stimulated, mixed current signals including, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs), could be observed in CA1 pyramidal cells while slices were superfused with the normal, Na(+)-containing, medium. The mIPSCs could be blocked by bicuculline (10 microm). mEPSCs, eEPSCs and eIPSCs could not be observed when the Na(+)-containing perfusion medium was replaced by a Na(+)-free medium but reappeared when the Na(+)-containing medium was re-introduced. When a polarizing electrode was placed near the recorded neuron, while slices were superfused with the Na(+)-free medium, and depolarizing rectangular current pulses of different magnitudes were applied, the number of mIPSCs increased with increasing amount of the current. Amplitudes of the mIPSCs showed a Gaussian distribution and the coefficient of variation was small. These observations indicate that a combination of the Na(+)-free superfusing medium and local depolarizations with a polarizing electrode is useful for recording mIPSCs from a localized area of the recorded neuron and for quantal analysis.",Excluded
4560,"Additional radiation exposure and fluoroscopy time in patients treated for tandem occlusions in the anterior circulation - A matched-pair analysis. Background: Since radiation exposure in interventional radiology is of growing interest and the number of performed endovascular stroke treatments (EST), i. e. mechanical thrombectomy (MT)-is increasing, the demand of dose reference levels (DRL) is growing. This study was performed to quantify the additional radiation exposure (RE) and fluoroscopy time (FT) needed in patients treated for a tandem occlusion in the anterior circulation compared to patients without a preceding carotid artery occlusion or stenosis receiving EST. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained stroke database of a comprehensive stroke center focusing on the RE (as per dose area product in muGy*m2, median [IQR]), procedure and FT (in minutes, median [IQR]) in patients receiving carotid artery stenting (CAS) and MT in the anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Patients who received CAS and MT were matched with patients needing only MT according to number of thrombectomy maneuvers, location of intracranial occlusion, mode of anesthesia, gender and age (order of decreasing priority). Ergebnisse: Overall 236 patients (n = 118 in each group) have been included in this analysis. Additionally to matching criteria, there was no significant difference in patient's pre-morbid degree of disability (as per modified Rankin Scale), initial severity of stroke symptoms (as per National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), and administration of i. v. rtPA or time from stroke onset to groin puncture in patients with known symptom onset. Procedure times (CAS+: 121 [80-176]; CAS-: 66 [45-106]), fluoroscopy times (CAS+: 57 [37-88]; CAS-: 3 2 [20-53]) as well as radiation exposure (CAS+: 19042 [13603-28722]; CAS-: 12379 [9307-18969]) were significantly higher in patients receiving CAS (all p-values: <0.0001). This is a relative median increase of radiation exposure of 53.8% and a relative increase of 78.2% of fluoroscopy time. Conclusion(s): As expected, patients treated for tandem occlusions receiving carotid artery stenting and intracranial mechanical thrombectomy have a massive increase of radiation exposure and fluoroscopy time compared to patients treated for intracranial large vessel occlusion only.

The results demonstrated that 125 mT SMF could influence the inactivation kinetics of these two VGPC currents by altering the inactivation rate and velocity. No significant change was observed in the activation properties. These findings supported the hypothesis that biological membrane would be deformed in moderate-intensity SMF and the physiological characteristics of ion channels on the membrane would be influenced.

4029,"Rapid enzymatic response to compensate UV radiation in copepods. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) causes physical damage to DNA, carboxylation of proteins and peroxidation of lipids in copepod crustaceans, ubiquitous and abundant secondary producers in most aquatic ecosystems. Copepod adaptations for long duration exposures include changes in behaviour, changes in pigmentation and ultimately changes in morphology. Adaptations to short-term exposures are little studied. Here we show that short-duration exposure to UVR causes the freshwater calanoid copepod, Eudiaptomus gracilis, to rapidly activate production of enzymes that prevent widespread collateral peroxidation (glutathione S-transferase, GST), that regulate apoptosis cell death (Caspase-3, Casp-3), and that facilitate neurotransmissions (cholinesterase-ChE). None of these enzyme systems is alone sufficient, but they act in concert to reduce the stress level of the organism. The interplay among enzymatic responses provides useful information on how organisms respond to environmental stressors acting on short time scales. © 2012 Souza et al.",Excluded
3922,"Boron neutron capture therapy combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas - A pilot study. Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control, and no standard protocol has been established for their treatment. At our institute, we have often treated RMGs by tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop and cause severe neurological complications and sometimes death. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN following BNCT, recent studies have used bevacizumab (BV). We herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT to confer protection against or ameliorate BRN, and evaluated; the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. Seven patients with RMGs (grade 3 and 4 cases) were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, followed by successive BV treatments. They were followed-up to December 2017. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively. In one case, uncontrollable brain edema occurred and ultimately led to death after BV was interrupted due to meningitis. In two other cases, symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred after interruption of BV treatment. No BRN was observed during the observation period in the other cases. Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments.

4094,"Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7, mda-7/IL-24, selectively induces growth suppression, apoptosis and radiosensitization in malignant gliomas in a p53-independent manner. Malignant gliomas are extremely aggressive cancers currently lacking effective treatment modalities. Gene therapy represents a promising approach for this disease. A requisite component for improving gene-based therapies of brain cancer includes tumor suppressor genes that exhibit cancer constrained inhibitory activity. Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7) as a gene associated with melanoma cell growth, differentiation and progression. Ectopic expression of mda-7 by means of a replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad), Ad.mda-7, induces growth suppression and apoptosis selectively in diverse human cancers, without producing any apparent harmful effect in normal cells. We presently demonstrate that Ad.mda-7 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in malignant human gliomas expressing both mutant and wild-type p53, and these effects correlate with an elevation in expression of members of the growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) gene family. In contrast, infection with a recombinant Ad expressing wild-type p53, Ad.wtp53, specifically affects mutant p53 expressing gliomas. When tested in early passage normal and immortal human fetal astrocytes, growth inhibition resulting from infection with Ad.mda-7 or Ad.wtp53 is significantly less than in malignant gliomas and no toxicity is evident in these normal cells. Moreover, infection of gliomas with Ad.mda-7 or treatment with purified GST-MDA-7 protein sensitizes both wild-type and mutant p53 expressing tumor cells to the growth inhibitory and antisurvival effects of ionizing radiation, and this response correlates with increased expression of specific members of the GADD gene family. Since heterogeneity in p53 expression is common in evolving gliomas, the present findings suggest that Ad.mda-7 may, in many instances, prove more beneficial for the gene-based therapy of malignant gliomas than administration of wild-type p53.",Excluded

The present investigation was designed to evaluate the feasibility of single photon emission tomography (SPET) with IPA to image brain tumours under routine clinical conditions. Using a dual- and a triple-headed SPET camera, whole-body kinetic and brain SPET, as well as plasma, urinary and dosimetric analysis were determined in four patients with gliomas after intravenous injection of IPA. Results obtained by IPA SPET were retrospectively compared with histopathology, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Tumour lesions were clearly demonstrated by IPA SPET at 30 min, 1 h and 4.5 h post-injection, even in patients with low grade gliomas. In patients with glioblastoma, excellent visualization of the tumour was possible even at 7 h p.i., indicative of the high retention of the radiopharmaceutical in cerebral gliomas. Analysis of the radioactivity in plasma and urine attested to the high in vivo stability of IPA. Blood clearance was rapid (> 65% after 10 min) and IPA was excreted predominantly by the kidneys, the urinary radioactivity excretion ranging from 27% at 1 h to 54% of injected doses at 5 h p.i. The average effective dose for adults was estimated to be 0.0152 mSv.MBq<sup>-1</sup>, leading to an effective dose of 3.8 mSv in a typical brain SPET investigation with 250 MBq IPA. This result strongly suggests that IPA is a potentially valuable brain tumour imaging agent for widespread clinical studies with SPET. Its high specific tumour uptake and retention even in low grade gliomas represent a major advantage compared to presently available SPET radiopharmaceuticals. Moreover, the radiation dose estimates indicate that clinical use of IPA will result in acceptable radiation dose levels in humans. (© 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins).",Excluded

We established an in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay of human tumours for estimation of the proportion of cells undergoing mitosis (the dividing fraction, DF), the time for the number of nuclei to double and the radiosensitivity in terms of the micronucleus frequency, based on a concept described previously. Under certain conditions, the nuclear number doubling time (NNDT) was considered to represent the potential doubling time. Tumour specimens obtained at surgery were disaggregated into single-cell suspensions and were directly cultured in the presence of cytochalasin B with or without irradiation. At various intervals, the percentage of multinucleate cells (the plateau value represented the DF), the average number of nuclei per cell and the number of micronuclei in binucleate cells were determined. DF and NNDT values were obtained in 58 of the 73 tumours investigated, and the micronucleus frequency was obtained in 54 of these 58 tumours. The DF ranged from 4.1% to 71% and the NNDT ranged from 3.1 to 83 days. A DF > or = 20% was associated with a higher recurrence rate in patients undergoing curative operation. A correlation was found between the NNDT and the time to relapse in patients with recurrent disease. The average number of micronuclei per binucleate cell at 2 Gy of irradiation (after subtraction of the value at 0 Gy) ranged from 0.052 to 0.35. Tumours which produced more micronuclei after irradiation showed a better response to radiotherapy.

PURPOSE: To investigate the modulation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in a mouse model.METHODS: Mice were exposed to intense green light. Light-induced activation of NF-kappaB and its nuclear localization were studied by immunohistochemistry. The NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in the retinas after exposure to light was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear transactivation of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor cells was determined by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. The amount of NF-kappaB p65 in the photoreceptor cells after exposure to light was assessed by Western blot analysis. To obtain more photoreceptor-specific information, microdissected photoreceptor cells were used in some studies.RESULTS: By an immunohistochemical method, the perinuclear region of the photoreceptor cells was heavily labeled with an antibody to activated NF-kappaB after a 1-hour exposure to light. Nuclear localization of NF-kappaB in the photoreceptor nucleus was seen at 12 hours. In the experiments involving 3 hours of exposure to light followed by recovery in the dark, nuclear localization of NF-kappaB was also noted after 12 hours' recovery in the dark. During continuous exposure to light, the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity gradually increased and reached its maximum at 12 hours. There was an increase of NF-kappaB p65 protein at 3 hours.

Slices prepared from LS, MS and DB regions were preincubated with [(3)H]5-HT, superfused in the presence of 6-nitro-2-(1-piperazinyl)-quinoline (6-nitroquipazine) and electrically stimulated up to three times (first electrical stimulation period (S(1)), S(2), S(3); 360 pulses, 3 Hz, 2 ms, 26-28 mA). In all septal regions the Ca(2+)-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive electrically-evoked overflow of [(3)H] was inhibited by the 5-HT(1B) agonist CP-93,129 and the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline tartrate (UK-14,304). Also the mu- and kappa-opioid receptor agonists (d-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), glycinol(5))-enkephalin (DAMGO) and [trans-(1S,2S(-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzenacetamide hydro-chloride] (U-50,488H), respectively, acted inhibitory (although less potently), whereas the delta-opioid receptor agonist (d-Pen(2), d-Pen(5))-enkephalin (DPDPE), the dopamine D(2) receptor agonist quinpirole and the adenosine A(1) receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine were all ineffective; the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen had weak effects. All inhibitory effects of the agonists were antagonized by the corresponding antagonists (3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-4-hydroxy-N-[4-(4-pyridinyl)phenyl]benzamide dihydrochloride (GR-55,562), idazoxan, naloxone, nor-binaltorphimine), which also significantly enhanced the evoked release of 5-HT at S(1). It is concluded that 5-HT release in septal nuclei of the rat is modulated by presynaptic 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors, as well as by alpha(2)-, mu- and kappa-opioid heteroreceptors. All of these receptors seem to be under a tonic inhibitory influence of the corresponding endogenous agonists and show qualitatively comparable modulatory properties along the dorso-ventral distribution of the 5-HT terminals.",Excluded
3809,"Intrinsic and extrinsic light responses in melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells during mouse development. Melanopsin (Opn4) is a photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to various brain areas. These neurons are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and are implicated in nonimage-forming responses to environmental light such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian entrainment. Recent evidence indicates that ipRGCs respond to light at birth, but questions remain as to whether and when they undergo significant functional changes. We used bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis to engineer a mouse line in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under the control of the melanopsin promoter. Double immunolabeling for EGFP and melanopsin demonstrates their colocalization in ganglion cells of mutant mouse retinas. Electrophysiological recordings of ipRGCs in neonatal mice (postnatal day 0 [P0] to P7) demonstrated that these cells responded to light with small and sluggish depolarization. However, starting at P11 we observed ipRGCs that responded to light with a larger and faster onset (<1 s) and offset (<1 s) depolarization. These faster, larger depolarizations were observed in most ipRGCs by early adult ages. However, on application of a cocktail of synaptic blockers, we found that all cells responded to light with slow onset (>2.5 s) and offset (>10 s) depolarization, revealing the intrinsic, melanopsin-mediated light responses. The extrinsic, cone/rod influence on ipRGCs correlates with their extensive dendritic stratification in the inner plexiform layer. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ipRGCs make use of melanopsin for phototransduction before eye opening and that these cells further integrate signals derived from the outer retina as the retina matures.",Excluded
3907,"Effect of acid predissolution on fibril size and fibril flexibility of synthetic beta-amyloid peptide. beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) is the major protein component of senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's patients. Several researchers have demonstrated that A beta is neurotoxic in in vitro and in vivo systems. Peptide aggregation state and/or conformation might play a significant role in determining the toxicity of the peptide. The size and flexibility of fibrils formed from the synthetic peptide beta (1-39), corresponding to the first 39 residues of A beta, were determined. Samples were prepared either directly from lyophilized peptide or diluted from a 10 mg/ml stock solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). All samples had a final peptide concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, a final pH of 7.4, and a final NaCl concentration of 0.14 M. The molecular weight and linear density of the fibrils increased with increasing pre-incubation time in TFA, based on static light scattering measurements. Analysis of the angular dependence of the intensity of scattered light indicated that the fibrils were semi-flexible chains and that the fibril flexibility decreased with increasing pre-incubation time in TFA. There was a concomitant change in phase behavior from precipitation to gelation with the decrease in fibril flexibility.",Excluded

To evaluate the size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) patients with or without optic pathway glioma (OPG) with 3D-SPACE sequence in 3 tesla magnetic resonans imaging (MRI) unit. Material and methods. Sixteen NF-1 patients with OPG (group 1), and 17 NF-1 patients without OPG (group 2) were included in this prospective study. All patients received conventional contrast-material enhanced brain MRI, and 3D-SPACE sequence. The size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath was measured on routine fat-saturated T2 weighted STIR and 3D-SPACE images. Patients with optic nerve glioma were excluded from the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath analysis. Results. The average size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath measured with both MRI techniques did not show any significant difference between group 1 and group 2 (p> 0.05). The variables measured with either STIR or 3DSPACE imaging techniques were correlated with each other in both groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). Discussion and conclusions. Our study demonstrated that OPG presented in the optic pathways including optic chiasm, optic tractus, and optic radiations did not significantly effect the size of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheat. 3D-SPACE sequence is an efficient sequence for evaluation of NF-1 patients.",Excluded
3645,"Radiation therapy for melanoma: Adjuvant, palliative and abscopal effects. Radiation therapy (RT) has long played a role in the management of melanoma, however historically its efficacy has been questioned due to the perceived radioresistance of melanoma cells in vitro. Apart from proton therapy for choroidal melanoma, RT has limited accepted indications as a definitive treatment. Surgery remains the first line therapy of choice for operable patients and adjuvant RT can be considered for high-risk primary tumours. Prospective randomised data are awaited following a Phase II TROG study reporting high local control rates (93%) following postoperative nodal irradiation in selected patients with node-positive melanoma. High response rates of melanoma (e.g. mucosal or inoperable) to primary radiotherapy have also been reported. Local radiation can achieve tumour-antigen release and clinical results suggest biological interaction with immunomodulating agents (a checkpoint inhibitor and anti-CTLA4 antibody), corroborated by preclinical data. Much interest also lies in enhancing melanoma radiation response rates through combination with clinical hyperthermia, which can achieve radiosensitisation, at least in part, by immune modulation. Novel developments in radiotherapy include the rise in radiosurgical treatment (SRS), involving high dose, small volume irradiation. SRS is increasingly the palliation of choice for patients with two or more brain metastases, following resection of a single brain metastasis and for extra-cranial oligometastases. The results of a Phase III trial evaluating whole brain radiotherapy are awaited. The radiobiological consequences of SRS may be even more immunomodulatory, congruent with retrospective data that fraction sizes greater than 4 Gray are more effective and SRS alone has been suggested to induce an abscopal effect. To date there are limited data reporting SRS with concomitant immunomodulators and the optimal combinations remain to be defined. Serious toxicities have been reported following administration of B-RAF inhibitors with and subsequent to both SRS and fractionated RT. Combination strategies are being actively researched as these should increase the effectiveness of radiation in the management of patients with melanoma by widening the therapeutic window between normal tissue toxicity and melanoma cell kill, and by potentially inducing an out-offield abscopal effect.",Excluded

4111,"Subthalamic nucleus stimulation for primary dystonia and tardive dystonia. With the renaissance of stereotactic pallidotomy for Parkinson's disease in 1990s, pallidotomy has become increasingly used as an effective treatment for various manifestations of medically refractory dystonia. More recently, deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been replacing pallidotomy. Although GPi DBS has great promise for treating dystonia, there are some disadvantages. We introduce our experiences in subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS for primary dystonia and tardive dystonia in this chapter. We propose that STN DBS has the following advantages over GPi DBS: (1) symptomatic improvement is seen immediately after stimulation, allowing us to quickly select the most suitable stimulation parameters; (2) the stimulation parameters for the STN are lower than those used for the GPi, resulting in longer battery life; and (3) STN DBS results in better symptomatic control than GPi DBS in dystonia patients when our STN data is compared to that obtained by others with using the GPi as the target. We suggest that STN DBS may be the most appropriate surgical technique for dystonia. [References: 50]",Excluded

3929,"Analysis of treatment outcome after stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous sinus meningiomas. OBJECT: The long-term outcome of stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous sinus (CS) meningiomas is not fully understood. The authors retrospectively reviewed their experience with 40 CS meningiomas treated with gamma knife radiosurgery.METHODS: Follow-up periods for the 40 patients ranged from 12 to 123 months (median 42 months), and the overall tumor control rates were 86.4% at 3 years and 82.3% at 10 years. Factors associated with tumor recurrence in univariate analysis were histological malignancy (p < 0.0001), partial treatment (p < 0.0001), suprasellar tumor extension (p = 0.0201), or extension in more than three directions outside the CS (p = 0.0345). When the tumor was completely covered with a dose to the margin that was higher than 14 Gy (Group A, 22 patients), no patient showed recurrence within the median follow-up period of 37 months. On the other hand, when a part of the tumor was treated with 10 to 12 Gy (Group B, 15 patients) or did not receive radiation therapy (Group C, three patients), the recurrence rates were 20% and 100%, respectively. Neurological deterioration was seen in nine patients, but all symptoms were transient or very mild.CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that stereotactic radiosurgery can control tumor growth if the whole mass can be irradiated by dosages of more than 14 Gy. When optimal radiosurgical planning is not feasible because of a tumor's large size, irregular shape, or proximity to visual pathways, use of limited surgical resection before radiosurgery is the best option and should provide sufficient long-term tumor control with minimal complications.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of an extremely low frequency sinusoidal magnetic field (ELF MF) with frequency of 10 Hz and intensity of 1.8-3.8 mT on the levels of the biogenic amines dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), and noradrenaline (NA), as well as on DA and 5-HT turnover in corpus striatum and frontal cortex of adult male Wistar rats. We found that ELF MF exposure for 14 days, 1 h daily, did not influence the level of the examined biogenic amines and metabolites, but increased the rate of synthesis (turnover) of DA and 5-HT in rat frontal cortex as compared to control, sham exposed rats. On the basis of the present results and our previous findings, extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF MF) exposure has been found to alter both turnover and receptor reactivity of monoaminergic systems, as well as some behaviors induced by these systems or their agonists and antagonists.",Excluded
3823,"Dose-responses from multi-model inference for the non-cancer disease mortality of atomic bomb survivors. The non-cancer mortality data for cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular diseases from Report 13 on the atomic bomb survivors published by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation were analysed to investigate the dose-response for the influence of radiation on these detrimental health effects. Various parametric and categorical models (such as linear-no-threshold (LNT) and a number of threshold and step models) were analysed with a statistical selection protocol that rated the model description of the data. Instead of applying the usual approach of identifying one preferred model for each data set, a set of plausible models was applied, and a sub-set of non-nested models was identified that all fitted the data about equally well. Subsequently, this sub-set of non-nested models was used to perform multi-model inference (MMI), an innovative method of mathematically combining different models to allow risk estimates to be based on several plausible dose-response models rather than just relying on a single model of choice. This procedure thereby produces more reliable risk estimates based on a more comprehensive appraisal of model uncertainties. For CVD, MMI yielded a weak dose-response (with a risk estimate of about one-third of the LNT model) below a step at 0.6 Gy and a stronger dose-response at higher doses. The calculated risk estimates are consistent with zero risk below this threshold-dose. For mortalities related to cardiovascular diseases, an LNT-type dose-response was found with risk estimates consistent with zero risk below 2.2 Gy based on 90% confidence intervals. The MMI approach described here resolves a dilemma in practical radiation protection when one is forced to select between models with profoundly different dose-responses for risk estimates.",Included

Cranial irradiation-induced inflammation plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI).

Corilagin (beta-1-O-galloyl-3, 6-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-D-glucose, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>18</sub>) was a novel member of the tannin family with anti-inflammatory properties and is isolated from some medicinal plants, such as Phyllanthus amarus and Caesalpinia coriaria. In this study, the effect of Corilagin on RIBI was investigated and the underlying mechanisms were explored. Spatial learning and memory ability of mice were investigated by the Morris water maze test. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy were used to assess the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, were measured by using real-time PCR and Western blotting. The activation of microglial cells and expression of TNF-alpha were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and IkappaBalpha, and the translocation of p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus were detected by using Western blotting. Morris water maze test showed that Corilagin ameliorated the neurocognitive deficits in RIBI mice. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy exhibited that Corilagin partially protected the BBB integrity from cranial irradiation-caused damage; immunofluorescence staining showed that Corilagin could inhibit microglial activation and TNF-alpha expression. Real-time PCR and Western blotting revealed that Corilagin downregulated the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and inhibited the irradiation-induced activation of NF-kappaB pathways by upregulating p-STAT3 expression. In conclusion, Corilagin could attenuate RIBI through inhibiting microglial activation and the expressions of inflammatory cytokines. Corilagin might inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB pathway in a STAT3-associated manner, thereby downregulating the inflammatory cytokine expressions.",Included

4284,"Treatment of progression of diffuse astrocytoma by herbal medicine: Case report. Background: The paper presents the results of the use of phytotherapy in a 33-year-old woman who, after finishing the oncological treatment of diffuse astrocytoma, had tumour progression. Material(s) and Method(s): Phytotherapy was introduced after the tumour had progressed. It consisted of 4 types of herbal medicine which the subject was taking in form of tea once a day at regular intervals. The patient started phytotherapy along with temozolomide, which was the only oncological treatment she was under after the tumour had progressed. Following the finished chemotherapy, the patient continued the treatment with herbal medicine only. She regularly took phytotherapy without interruption and to the fullest extent for 30 months, and the results of treatment were monitored by periodic scanning using nuclear magnetic resonance technique. Result(s): The control scanning that was conducted after the end of combined treatment with temozolomide and phytotherapy showed tumour regression. The patient continued with phytotherapy after finishing chemotherapy and, during the following 24 months, it was the sole treatment option. In that period, the regression of the tumour continued, until a control examination 30 months after the introduction of phytotherapy showed no clinical and radiological signs of tumour. Conclusion(s): The results presented in this research paper clearly indicate the potential of phytotherapy in the treatment of some types of brain tumours. A complete regression of tumour following the treatment with nothing but herbal medicine offers support for such claim. Future research should demonstrate the effectiveness of phytotherapy, as a supplementary form of brain tumour treatment, and the results of this research should be compared with the existing information on the effectiveness of the protocols currently used in the treatment of these types of tumour.

Radiotherapy (RT) has proven to be an effective therapeutic tool in treatment of a wide variety of brain tumors; however, it has a negative impact on quality of life and neurocognitive function. Cognitive dysfunction associated with both the disease and adverse effects of RT is one of the most concerning complication among long-term survivors. The effects of RT to brain can be divided into acute, early delayed, and late delayed. It is, however, the late delayed effects of RT that lead to severe neurological consequences such as minor-to-severe cognitive deficits due to irreversible focal or diffuse necrosis of brain parenchyma.

3984,"Thoracic radiotherapy of SCLC. Limited stage: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 10-15% of all lung tumors and is associated with an aggressive clinical behavior. Two out of three patients presents with hematogenous metastases at diagnosis (extensive stage (ES)). For patients without hematogenous metastases (limited stage (LS)), chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment. Although radiotherapy after chemotherapy has the theoretical benefit of treating smaller target volumes with less toxicity, concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown to be superior. Moreover, earlier use of radiotherapy during chemotherapy leads to better results. The absolute benefit of early versus late radiotherapy was about 10% for patients who had received cisplatinum-based chemotherapy.1 Turrisi et al.2 demonstrated that twice daily radiotherapy starting with a first course of chemotherapy resulted in improved survival rates. Median survival was 23 months for patients who received twice-daily radiotherapy (45 Gy/30 fractions/3 weeks) versus 19 months for once daily treated patients (45 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks). The corresponding 5 years survival rates were 26% and 16%. However, more Grade 3-4 oesophagitis was seen during twice-daily treatment (32% versus 16%). Only a minority of patients in the US and Europe receive twice daily radiotherapy. Recently the results of the CONVERT trial, in which once-daily radiotherapy (70Gy) was compared with twice daily radiotherapy (45 Gy) were presented.3 Radiotherapy was initiated at the 2nd course of 4-6 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two arms. Overall survival at 2 years was 56% for patients treated twice-daily versus 51% for patients treated once-daily (p= 0.15).3 There was also no significant difference in time to progression. There were no differences in a acute toxicity, except for Grade 3-4 neutropenia, which occurred more often in the twicedaily treatment arm (74% versus 65%). There were no differences in Grade 3-5 oesophagitis (19%) and pneumonitis (2%). The authors concluded that survival in both study arms was higher than reported previously and that radiation related toxicities were lower than expected, probably related to the use of modern radiotherapy techniques. The results of the study support the use of either twice daily or once daily as standard of care for patients with limited stage disease and in good performance score. In RTOG0538 study, which also compares 70 Gy once-daily and 45 Gy twice-daily radiotherapy, radiotherapy commences with the first or second course of chemotherapy. The results of this study are eagerly awaited.4 Extensive stage: In the EORTC study on prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for ES-SCLC, it was noted that the vast majority of patients still had intrathoracic disease after completion of chemotherapy. After on the positive effects of PCI which not only reduced the risk of symptomatic brain metastases (40 versus 15%) but also improved overall survival (1 year: 27 versus 13% (P= 0,003)),5 the next logical step was to investigate the use of thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC as well. Evidence for a possible role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in ESSCLC also comes from the results of a trial published by Jeremic et al. in 19996 in which patients with ES-SCLC and good prognosis with a complete response outside the thorax were randomized between TRT plus PCI during chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and PCI only. Overall survival was 17 months for the patients who received thoracic radiotherapy versus 11 months for those who did not. In the CREST trial, patients with ES-SCLC and any response after 4-6 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy were randomized between PCI plus TRT (30Gy/10 fractions) or PCI only. Overall survival at one year, the primary endpoint of the study, was not statistically significant between the groups (p=0.066) but with longer follow up the survival curves diverged and at 2 years, survival was 13% in patients who received TRT versus 3% in the controls (p=0,004). There was also significant dif erence in progression free survival. In an additional analysis of patients with and without residual intrathoracic disease, which was one of the stratification factors of the study, it was demonstrated that there was no significant benefit of TRT in patients with a CR in the thorax. However, in patients with residual intrathoracic disease after chemotherapy, TRT led to a significant improvement in overall survival. 7 In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the risk of intrathoracic recurrence was reduced from 80% to 44%. In patients who received thoracic radiotherapy the most recurrences occurred outside the brain and the thorax and at a later stage. The next logical step after demonstration of a beneficial effect of PCI and TRT would be the use of higher doses for TRT and possibly also treatment of extrathoracic metastatic sites. This topic was addressed in the NRG-RTOG0937 study and was presented at ASTRO 2015.8 patients with ES-SCLC and a CR or PR after chemotherapy and 1-4 metastatic lesions were randomized between PCI or PCI plus TRT plus radiotherapy of metastatic sites. The study which accrued very slowly was closed early due to observed toxicities. The study did not show a survival difference between the two groups, but included only 86 patients over a five years period and had imbalance groups with worse prognostic factors in the experimental arm. There were many, partly unrelated, Grade 4-5 toxicities in the experimental arm. To define which patients are most likely to benefit from a more aggressive approach we have performed an additional analysis for patients from the top accruing centers from the CREST trial. An evaluation of 260 patients showed significantly better outcome in patients with 0 to 2 metastases versus and without liver metastases.10 These patients are believed to be best candidates for future studies.",Excluded
4463,"Monkey, rat, and first in human evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]PF- 06445974, a PET radioligand that preferentially labels phosphodiesterase 4B. Introduction: Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) metabolizes and terminates the actions of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 has four isozymes: A, B, C, and D. PDE4B and PDE4D have the highest expression in brain and are linked to cognitive deficits as well as major depressive disorder (MDD). This PET study assessed the newly developed PDE4B-selective radioligand [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 in rats, rhesus monkeys and, for the first time, humans. A concomitant goal was to determine whether [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 could accurately quantify PDE4 in human brain. Method(s): In two human subjects, two whole body PET scans for radiation exposure dosimetry and three brain PET scans for specific PDE4B quantification were performed. In the pharmacokinetic analysis, target enzyme density was quantified as total distribution volume (V ) using the two-tissue compartment model and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. In one male rhesus monkey, four PET whole body scans were performed on different days. The first scan was acquired under baseline conditions, and rolipram (1.0 mg/kg), a PDE4 inhibitor, was administered IV in the second scan. The same baseline and blocked paradigms were repeated with PF- 06445974 (0.1 mg/kg) as the blocking drug. Finally, brain PET scans were conducted in four rats. Concentration of radioactivity as standardized uptake value (SUV) was compared across conditions and species. Result(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 readily entered human brain and showed widespread distribution, with lower binding in cerebellum. V was well identified in all examined brain regions, and V calculated from the first 90 min of scan data fell within 10%. V was highest in thalamus and striatum, broadly matching human brain RNA expression. Wholebody imaging in the two humans and one monkey was notable for early distribution in the blood pool, accumulation in target organs (i.e., brain, lung), and excretion via urinary tract. Doses in the two humans were 19.6 and 19.3 muSV/MBq, respectively, similar to the value extrapolated from monkey (16.5 muSv/MBq). In monkey blocking scans, both drugs substantially blocked brain uptake; at 60 min, rolipram blocked 78% of uptake and PF-06445974 blocked 92%. However, for the rolipram-blocked scan, radioactivity in brain increased after 20 min and returned to baseline by the end of the scan. Rats showed a similar pattern to monkey. To assess whether this was due to radiometabolite in brain or rapid rolipram clearance, a second rolipram dose was injected as a displacing agent at 120 min in a rat that had undergone pre-injection of 1 mg/kg iv. This repeat rolipram dose replenished rolipram concentrations in brain and restored its ability to block radioligand binding, proving that no radiometabolite entered rat or monkey brain. Conclusion(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 successfully imaged and quantified PDE4B in human brain. No radiometabolite contamination occurred, reflecting parent radioligand binding to PDE4 in brain. In nonhuman primates,, rolipram washed out more quickly than PF-06445974. Fig.1 In human brain, [<sup>18</sup>F]PF-06445974 had widespread distribution, with high uptake in striatum and thalamus.

The role of olfaction/olfactory cues on photoperiodic responses was assessed in Malagasy primate, the gray mouse lemur. When exposed to short photoperiod (SP), this primate demonstrates rapid changes in energy balance as adaptive anticipatory response for winter survival. To follow early changes induced by SP exposure, body mass, food intake, resting metabolism (RMR) and free thyroxin levels in plasma (T4) were measured in males abruptly transferred to SP: six intact males (controls), eight males that underwent bilateral olfactory removal (BOX) and eight males exposed to male urinary cues (U-exposed). To assess the effect of SP exposure, two other groups were maintained for 6 weeks under LP: six controls and six BOX males. Whereas all studied parameters remained constant in controls and BOX males maintained under LP, exposure to SP led to different responses according to groups. In controls, SP exposure led to a regular increase in body mass and after 4 weeks under SP, plasma T4 levels, food consumption and RMR significantly decreased. Even if BOX males demonstrated hyperphagic patterns regardless of the photoperiod, an increase in body mass was also induced by SP exposure but without changes in RMR or food intake that were body mass-dependent. In U-exposed males, body mass gain was significantly reduced while food intake and RMR remained high. In both BOX and U-exposed males, SP exposure led to a transient but high increase in T4 levels compared to controls. These results suggest that olfaction/olfactory cues may delay the SP-mediated changes in energy balance.",Excluded
4230,"Computed tomography versus intravenous urography in diagnosis of acute flank pain from urolithiasis: a randomized study comparing imaging costs and radiation dose. The equivalent sensitivity of non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and intravenous urography (IVU) in the diagnosis of suspected ureteric colic has been established. Approximately 50% of patients with suspected ureteric colic do not have a nephro-urological cause for pain. Because many such patients require further imaging studies, NCCT may obviate the need for these studies and, in so doing, be more cost effective and involve less overall radiation exposure. The present study compares the total imaging cost and radiation dose of NCCT versus IVU in the diagnosis of acute flank pain. Two hundred and twenty-four patients (157 men; mean age 45 years; age range 19-79 years) with suspected renal colic were randomized either to NCCT or IVU. The number of additional diagnostic imaging studies, cost (IVU A$136; CTU A$173), radiation exposure and imaging times were compared. Of 119 (53%) patients with renal obstruction, 105 had no nephro-urological causes of pain. For 21 (20%) of these patients an alternative diagnosis was made at the initial imaging, 10 of which were significant. Of 118 IVU patients, 28 (24%) required 32 additional imaging tests to reach a diagnosis, whereas seven of 106 (6%) NCCT patients required seven additional imaging studies. The average total diagnostic imaging cost for the NCCT group was A$181.94 and A$175.46 for the IVU group (P < 0.43). Mean radiation dose to diagnosis was 5.00 mSv (NCCT) versus 3.50 mSv (IVU) (P < 0.001). Mean imaging time was 30 min (NCCT) versus 75 min (IVU) (P < 0.001). Diagnostic imaging costs were remarkably similar. Although NCCT involves a higher radiation dose than IVU, its advantages of faster diagnosis, the avoidance of additional diagnostic imaging tests and its ability to diagnose other causes makes it the study of choice for acute flank pain at Christchurch Hospital.",Excluded

4455,"Evidence that tRNA synthetase-directed proton transfer stops mistranslation. To prevent mistranslation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) discriminate against noncognate amino acids and cellular metabolites. Defects in specificity produce statistical proteins which, in mammalian cells, lead to activation of the unfolded protein response and cell death. Because of inherent limitations in amino acid discrimination by a single active site, AARSs evolved a separate domain to clear mischarged amino acids. Although the structure of a widely distributed editing domain for ThrRS and AlaRS is known, the mechanism of amino acid clearance remains elusive. This domain has two motifs that together have four conserved residues in the pocket used to clear serine from mischarged tRNAs. Here, using ThrRS as an example, rapid single-turnover kinetics, mutagenesis, and solvent isotope analysis show that a strictly conserved histidine (between ThrRS and AlaRS) extracts a proton in the chemical step of the editing reaction. Three other conserved residues, and two additional residues in the editing pocket, are not directly implicated in the chemical step. These results are relevant to the previously reported mutagenesis of the homologous editing pocket of alanyl-tRNA synthetase, where even a mild defect in editing causes neurodegeneration in the mouse. Thus, a single proton-transfer event needed to prevent mistranslation can have profound implications for disease.",Excluded
3756,"Zinc distribution in various tissues, (brain, eye, skin, muscle and blood) of rat during hindlimb suspension. Postural changes in 1-G environment induce well documented haemodynamic changes. On going from Earth's 1-G environment to the microgravity of space a marked cephalic blood volume shift occurs in humans with a subsequent loss of 2-3 L of fluid determined by diuresis and decreased fluid intake. Moreover, a number of transient changes in serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calium have been observed in astronauts during spaceflight. It is conceivable that changes in the fluid status, and reduced muscle activities, which are changed by the microgravity environment, would also result in redistribution of some trace elements, such as zinc, copper and manganese. In particular, zinc metabolism, directly involved in many physiological processes, can be altered by a wide variety of factors including stress, rest, exercise, hormones and diet. Some of the microgravity-induced responses in space can be simulated in humans by using the posture of head-down tilt, and in rat by using the posture of hindlimb suspension. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of hindlimb suspension for 3-14 days on sodium, potassium and zinc content in various rat tissues including blood, muscle, brain, eye and nose's skin.",Excluded
4486,"Extended adjuvant temozolomide improves survival in a glioblastoma mouse model. Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients in conjunction with ionizing radiation (IR) or as an adjuvant agent. Yet the prognosis of GBM remains devastating with a median survival of 14 months. We investigated whether extended TMZ treatment cycles would provide survival benefit for GBM patients. To recapitulate the genomic and pathological heterogeneity found in GBM patients, we utilized patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. We demonstrated that the combination of TMZ and IR prevents tumor progression, but tumors ultimately recur and lead to death. Overall survival was prolonged when adjuvant TMZ treatment was administered with minimal toxicity. Additionally, development of resistance to TMZ and IR was often correlated with an increase in levels of MGMT protein, irrespective of the promoter methylation status. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of a voxel-based MRI biomarker, the functional diffusion map (fDM), as an imaging surrogate to detect spatially varying changes in tumor response, as well as a more sensitive predictor of overall response versus whole-volume tumor measurements. The fDM biomarker was also useful as an early predictor of impeding resistance to TMZ and IR. In summary, we demonstrate that prolonged TMZ treatment should be considered for the treatment of GBM patients. Furthermore, MRI based imaging allows early prediction of therapy response as well as impeding resistance.",Excluded

Averaged electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency spectra were studied in eight unanesthetized and unmyorelaxed adult male rats with chronically implanted carbon electrodes in symmetrical somesthetic areas when a weak (0.1-0.2 mW/cm) microwave (MW, 945 MHz) field, amplitude-modulated at extremely low frequency (ELF) (4 Hz), was applied. Intermittent (1 min ""On,"" 1 min ""Off"") field exposure (10-min duration) was used. Hemispheric asymmetry in frequency spectra (averaged data for 10 or 1 min) of an ongoing EEG was characterized by a power decrease in the 1.5-3 Hz range on the left hemisphere and by a power decrease in the 10-14 and 20-30 Hz ranges on the right hemisphere. No differences between control and exposure experiments were shown under these routines of data averaging. Significant elevations of EEG asymmetry in 10-14 Hz range were observed during the first 20 s after four from five onsets of the MW field, when averaged spectra were obtained for every 10 s. Under neither control nor pre- and postexposure conditions was this effect observed. These results are discussed with respect to interaction of MW fields with the EEG generators.",Excluded

Levodopa has been the mainstay treatment for Parkinson's disease for several decades, but the precise mechanism for its therapeutic action is still not well understood. To date, little distinction has been made between the effects of levodopa on the different brain DA pools. We studied the levodopa action on two extracellular DA pools: one was analyzed by microdialysis (often considered as indicative of volume transmission) and the other by in vivo amperometry during nigrostriatal cell stimulation (more indicative of neurotransmission). Levodopa administration induced a moderate (increased 200%) and tardy (began at 60 min) increase in the DA-pool measured by microdialysis, an effect that increased (increased 500%) and accelerated (began at 10 min) after DA-cell degeneration. Levodopa action on the DA-pool measured by amperometry was very fast (10 min) and prominent (increased 600%) in normal rats. The DA-denervated striatum showed a fast exhaustion during cell stimulation, which prevented further study of the levodopa effect on the DA amperometry-pool under this condition. This study suggests a different kinetic for levodopa action on the volume transmitter and neurotransmitter DA-pool, showing marked changes in levodopa action in the denervated striatum.",Excluded
4207,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma. PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma.METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves motor function in Parkinson disease (PD). However, little is known about the quantitative effects on motor behavior of unilateral STN DBS.METHODS: In 52 PD subjects with STN DBS, we quantified in a double-blinded manner rigidity (n=42), bradykinesia (n=38), and gait speed (n=45). Subjects were tested in four DBS conditions: both on, left on, right on and both off. A force transducer was used to measure rigidity across the elbow, and gyroscopes were used to measure angular velocity of hand rotations for bradykinesia. About half of the subjects were rated using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (part III) motor scores for arm rigidity and repetitive hand rotation simultaneously during the kinematic measurements. Subjects were timed walking 25 feet.RESULTS: All subjects had significant improvement with bilateral STN DBS. Contralateral, ipsilateral and bilateral stimulation significantly reduced rigidity and bradykinesia. Bilateral stimulation improved rigidity more than unilateral stimulation of either side, but there was no significant difference between ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation. Although bilateral stimulation also increased hand rotation velocity more than unilateral stimulation of either side, contralateral stimulation increased hand rotation significantly more than ipsilateral stimulation. All stimulation conditions improved walking time but bilateral stimulation provided the greatest improvement.CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral STN DBS decreased rigidity and bradykinesia contralaterally as well ipsilaterally. As expected, bilateral DBS improved gait more than unilateral DBS.",Excluded

Treatment sites were the external auditory canal in two, the nasopharynx in one, the oropharynx in three, the nasal cavity in one, the maxillary sinus in two, and the oligometastatic cervical lymph node in one. All patients underwent preceding conventional radiotherapy of 40 to 60 Gy. Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose.

3707,"DELTApH, H<sup>+</sup> diffusion potentials, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPase in neurosecretory vesicles isolated from bovine neurohypophyses. The proton gradient (DELTApH) and electrical potential (DELTApsi) across the neurosecretory vesicles were measured using the optical probes 9-aminoacridine and Oxanol VI, respectively. The addition of neurosecretory vesicles to 9-aminoacridine resulted in a rapid quenching of the dye fluorescence which was reversed when the DELTApH was collapsed with ammonium chloride or K<sup>+</sup> in the presence of nigericin. From fluorescence quenching data and the intravesicular volume, DELTApH across the membrane was calculated. Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATP caused a marked carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-sensitive change in the membrane potential measured using Oxanol VI (plus 100 mV inside positive), presumably due to H<sup>+</sup> translocation across the neurosecretory vesicle membrane. Imposition of this membrane potential was responsible for the lysis of vesicles in the presence of permeant anions. The effectiveness of these anions to support lysis reflected the relative permeability of the anion which followed the order acetate > I<sup>-</sup> > Cl > F<sup>-</sup> > SO<inf>4</inf><sup>-</sup> = isethionate = methyl sulfate. These data showed that the neurosecretory vesicles possess a membrane H<sup>+</sup>-translocating system and prompted the study of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ATPase activities in the vesicle fractions. In intact vesicles a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPase appeared to be coupled to electrogenic proton translocation, since the enzyme activity was enhanced by uncoupling the electrical potential, using proton ionophores. Inhibition of this enzyme with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide also inhibited the carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-sensitive DELTApsi across the vesicle membrane caused by H<sup>+</sup> translocation. A second Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPase was also found on the vesicle membranes which is sensitive to vanadate.

Radiation is a widely used treatment for head and neck cancers, and one of its most severe side effects is ototoxicity. Radiation-induced ototoxicity has been demonstrated to be linked to the increased production of ROS and MAPK. We intended to investigate the effect of p38 inhibition on radiation-induced ototoxicity in cochlea-derived HEI-OC1 cells and in a zebrafish model. The otoprotective effect of p38 inhibition against radiation was tested in vitro in the organ of Corti-derived cell line, HEI-OC1, and in vivo in a zebrafish model. Radiation-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an increase of intracellular NO generation were demonstrated in HEI-OC1 cells. The p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, ameliorated radiation-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial injury in HEI-OC1 cells. p38 inhibition reduced radiation-induced activation of JNK, p38, cytochrome c, and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in HEI-OC1 cells. Scanning electron micrography showed that SB203580 prevented radiation-induced destruction of kinocilium and stereocilia in zebrafish neuromasts.

After 4 weeks of treatment, we observed the changes by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: (1) The average optical density of DBH-ir fibers and the number of alpha1-adrenoreceptor- and estrogen receptor (ER)alpha-positive neurons in the main nuclei of POAH were all reduced in OVX rats compared with the SHAM group. The above changes were normalized in all nuclei of the POAH in the E2 group, while they were normalized in some nuclei in the ICR group.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a model using radiomic features extracted from MR images to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumour progression in brain metastases after Gamma Knife radiosurgery.METHODS: We retrospectively identified 87 patients with pathologically confirmed necrosis (24 lesions) or progression (73 lesions) and calculated 285 radiomic features from four MR sequences (T1, T1 post-contrast, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) obtained at two follow-up time points per lesion per patient. Reproducibility of each feature between the two time points was calculated within each group to identify a subset of features with distinct reproducible values between two groups. Changes in radiomic features from one time point to the next (delta radiomics) were used to build a model to classify necrosis and progression lesions.RESULTS: A combination of five radiomic features from both T1 post-contrast and T2 MR images were found to be useful in distinguishing necrosis from progression lesions. Delta radiomic features with a RUSBoost ensemble classifier had an overall predictive accuracy of 73.2% and an area under the curve value of 0.73 in leave-one-out cross-validation.CONCLUSIONS: Delta radiomic features extracted from MR images have potential for distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumour progression after radiosurgery for brain metastases.KEY POINTS: * Some radiomic features showed better reproducibility for progressive lesions than necrotic ones * Delta radiomic features can help to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumour progression * Delta radiomic features had better predictive value than did traditional radiomic features.",Excluded
4777,"Microwaves and Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's diseases (AD) is the most common type of dementia and a neurodegenerative disease that occurs when the nerve cells in the brain die. The cause and treatment of AD remain unknown. However, AD is a disease that affects the brain, an organ that controls behavior. Accordingly, anything that can interact with the brain may affect this organ positively or negatively, thereby protecting or encouraging AD. In this regard, modern life encompasses microwaves for all issues including industrial, communications, medical and domestic tenders, and among all applications, the cell phone wave, which directly exposes the brain, continues to be the most used. Evidence suggests that microwaves may produce various biological effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and many arguments relay the possibility that microwaves may be involved in the pathophysiology of CNS disease, including AD. By contrast, previous studies have reported some beneficial cognitive effects and that microwaves may protect against cognitive impairment in AD. However, although many of the beneficial effects of microwaves are derived from animal models, but can easily be extrapolated to humans, whether microwaves cause AD is an important issue that is to be addressed in the current review.

4049,"Gamma Knife surgery for patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas: Predictors of tumor control, neurological deficits, and hypopituitarism - Clinical article. Object. Nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas often recur after microsurgery and thereby require further treatment. Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has been used to treat recurrent adenomas. In this study, the authors evaluated outcomes following GKS of nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas and assessed predictors of tumor control, neurological deficits, and delayed hypopituitarism. Methods. Between June 1989 and March 2010, 140 consecutive patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas were treated using GKS at the University of Virginia. The median patient age was 51 years (range 21-82 years), and 56% of patients were male. Mean tumor volume was 5.6 cm3 (range 0.6-35 cm3). Thirteen patients were treated with GKS as primary therapy, and 127 had undergone at least 1 open resection prior to GKS. Ninety-three patients had a history of hormone therapy prior to GKS. The mean maximal dose of GKS was 38.6 Gy (range 10-70 Gy), the mean marginal dose was 18 Gy (range 5-25 Gy), and the mean number of isocenters was 9.8 (range 1-26). Follow-up evaluations were performed in all 140 patients, ranging from 0.5 to 17 years (mean 5 years, median 4.2 years). Results. Tumor volume remained stable or decreased in 113 (90%) of 125 patients with available follow-up imaging. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression free survival at 2, 5, 8, and 10 years to be 98%, 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 cm3 (hazard ratio = 5.0, 95% CI 1.5-17.2; p = 0.023) was the only factor predictive of tumor growth. The median time to tumor progression was 14.5 years. Delayed hypopituitarism occurred in 30.3% of patients. No factor was predictive of post-GKS hypopituitarism. A new or worsening cranial nerve deficit occurred in 16 (13.7%) of 117 patients. Visual decline was the most common neurological deficit (12.8%), and all patients experiencing visual decline had evidence of tumor progression. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 cm3 (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.7; p = 0.025) and pre-GKS hypopituitarism (OR = 7.5, 95% CI 1.1-60.8; p = 0.05) were predictive of a new or worsened neurological deficit. Conclusions. In patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas, GKS confers a high rate of tumor control and a low rate of neurological deficits. The most common complication following GKS is delayed hypopituitarism, and this occurs in a minority of patients.",Excluded

The pineal gland of Sprague-Dawley rats housed under a LD regime (n=42) for four weeks and of a regime (n=42) for eight weeks were sampled at six different times, every 4 h (n=7 animals per time point), during a 24 h period. Total RNA was extracted from each sample, and the semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine temporal changes in mRNA levels of Clock and NAT genes during different circadian or zeitgeber times. The data and parameters were analyzed by the cosine function software, Clock Lab software, and the amplitude F test was used to reveal the circadian rhythm. In the DD or LD condition, both the Clock and NAT mRNA levels in the pineal gland showed robust circadian oscillation (p<0.05) with the peak at the subjective night or at nighttime. In comparison with the DD regime, the amplitudes and mRNA levels at the peaks of Clock and NAT expressions in LD in the pineal gland were significantly reduced (p<0.05). In the DD or LD condition, the circadian expressions of NAT were similar in pattern to those of Clock in the pineal gland (p>0.05). These findings indicate that the transcriptions of Clock and NAT genes in the pineal gland not only show remarkably synchronous endogenous circadian rhythmic changes, but also respond to the ambient light signal in a reduced manner.",Excluded
4395,"Changes in neocortical function in response to the direct action of optical radiation. The action of optical radiation on neocortical bioelectrical activity and on a penicillin-induced epileptic focus was investigated. The direct action of ultraviolet (UV) radiation with wavelengths 280, 310, and 365 nm was shown to increase the amplitude of the spontaneous EEG and to potentiate epileptiform activity, whereas the action of subthreshold radiation with wavelengths of 580 and 630 nm caused a reduction of EEG amplitude and inhibition of epileptiform activity. On the basis of the writers' own results and data in the literature it is postulated that the mechanism of action of UV radiation on neocortical electrical activity is based on changes in permeability of neuronal membranes to Na and K ions and subsequent membrane depolarization, whereas the action of visible radiation leads to thermal injury to the neurons in the irradiated zone, inducing irreversible suppression of their activity and a decrease in amplitude of the EEG.",Excluded
4192,"In vivo evaluation of 18F-MNI698: an 18F-labeled radiotracer for imaging of serotonin 4 receptors in brain. UNLABELLED: Serotonin 4 receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 [5HT4R]) hold promise as a novel therapeutic approach to multiple brain disorders, including Alzheimer and Huntington disease. In vivo imaging of these receptors with selective 5HT4R radiotracers and PET would be valuable to investigate alterations in 5HT4R in different brain disorders and to assist drug discovery. In this study, (18)F-MNI698 was evaluated as a potential PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain.METHODS: Eighteen PET studies were performed in 3 adult rhesus monkeys. The radiotracer was administered as a bolus intravenous injection or bolus plus constant infusion (time that would be required to inject the bolus at the infusion rate = 60 min), and arterial blood was collected for data quantification. Kinetic models were used to estimate distribution volumes and binding potentials, for which the cerebellum was used as a reference region. (18)F-MNI698 test-retest variability and upper mass dose limits were determined. Preblocking studies using several doses of SB204070, a selective 5HT4R antagonist, were performed.RESULTS: (18)F-MNI698 avidly entered the monkey brain (peak percentage injected dose of ~ 6.6%), and its brain distribution was consistent with known 5HT4R densities. At 120 min after bolus injection and after the start of radiotracer infusion, only less than 5% and approximately 10% parent compound was present in blood, respectively. Measured binding potentials were underestimated by 22%-36% when noninvasive methods were used for data quantification in comparison with invasive methods. A good agreement was found between test-retest measurements. The radiotracer upper mass dose limit (<5% occupancy) was determined to be 13.1 mug per 70 kg of body weight. SB204070 blocked the radiotracer binding in a dose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Data indicate that (18)F-MNI698 is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain, and human studies are warranted based on these study results.",Excluded
4210,"Effects of exposure to low level radiofrequency fields on acetylcholine release in hippocampus of freely moving rats. Some central cholinergic effects have been reported in animals after acute exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic field at low intensity. We studied acetylcholine (ACh) release in the brain of freely moving rats exposed for 1 h during the day to a 2.45 GHz continuous wave radiofrequency field (RF) (2 or 4 mW/cm(2)) or exposed for 1 or 14 h during the night to a 800 MHz field modulated at 32 Hz (AM 200 mW/cm(2)). Measurements were performed by microdialysis using a membrane implanted through the upper CA1 region of the hippocampus. After irradiation with the 2.45 GHz RF, rats exposed at 2 mW/cm(2) did not show a significant modification of Ach release, whereas those exposed at 4 mW/cm(2) showed a significant 40% decrease in mean ACh release from hippocampus. This decrease was maximal at 5 h post exposure. Exposure to the 800 MHz RF for 1 h did not cause any significant effect, but exposure for 14 hrs induced a significant 43% decrease in ACh release during the period 11 p.m.-4 a.m. compared to control rats. In the control group we observed an increase of ACh release at the beginning of the night, which was linked to the waking period of rats. This normal increase was disturbed in rats exposed overnight to the 800 MHz RF. This work indicates that neurochemical modification of the hippocampal cholinergic system can be observed during and after an exposure to low intensity RF.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: Many neurosurgeons obtain repeat head CT at the first clinic follow-up visit for nonoperative cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH). The authors undertook a single-center, retrospective study to determine whether outpatient CT altered clinical decision-making.METHODS: The authors evaluated 173 consecutive adult patients admitted to their institution from April 2006 to August 2012 with an admission diagnosis of cerebral contusion or tSAH and at least 1 clinic follow-up visit with CT. Patients with epidural, subdural, aneurysmal subarachnoid, or intraventricular hemorrhage, and those who underwent craniotomy, were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed for new CT findings, new patient symptoms, and changes in treatment plan. Patients were stratified by neurological symptoms into 3 groups: 1) asymptomatic; 2) mild, nonspecific symptoms; and 3) significant symptoms. Mild, nonspecific symptoms included minor headaches, vertigo, fatigue, and mild difficulties with concentration, short-term memory, or sleep; significant symptoms included moderate to severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, focal neurological complaints, impaired consciousness, or new cognitive impairment evident on routine clinical examination.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients met inclusion criteria, with initial clinic follow-up obtained within approximately 6 weeks. Of the 173 patients, 104 (60.1%) were asymptomatic, 68 patients (39.3%) had mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, and 1 patient (1.0%) had significant neurological symptoms. Of the asymptomatic patients, 3 patients (2.9%) had new CT findings and 1 of these patients (1.0%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings. This change involved an additional clinic appointment and CT to monitor a 12-mm chronic subdural hematoma that ultimately resolved without treatment. Of the patients with mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, 6 patients (8.8%) had new CT findings and 3 of these patients (4.4%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings; none of these patients required surgical intervention. The single patient with significant neurological symptoms did not have any new CT findings.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat outpatient CT of asymptomatic patients after nonoperative cerebral contusion and tSAH is very unlikely to demonstrate significant new pathology. Given the cost and radiation exposure associated with CT, imaging should be reserved for patients with significant symptoms or focal findings on neurological examination.",Excluded
3733,"COX-2 inhibitor as a radiation enhancer: New strategies for the treatment of lung cancer. Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality throughout the world, and the incidence continues to increase. Smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer. Emerging data have implicated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostanoid production in the pathogenesis of lung carcinoma. In invasive lung tumors, COX-2 upregulation has been reported in up to 90% of cases. COX-2 upregulation is an early event in the development of non-small-cell lung cancer and may be integral to the development of new blood vessels and production of specific proteases that are critical to growth and spread of lung malignancies. COX-2 inhibitors are known to enhance the chemosensitivity in COX-2 overexpressing lung cancer cell lines. Recently, we have demonstrated that selective COX-2 inhibitors also enhance the effect of radiation in COX-2 overexpressed cells. Therefore, inhibitors of COX-2 in combination with chemoradiation therapy may be an alternative strategy that can be tested in clinical trials. The combination of COX-2 inhibitors and radiation suggest a complementary strategy to target angiogenesis while potentially minimizing the impact on quality of life. Currently, several groups are conducting clinical trials in cervix cancer, lung cancer, and brain tumors, using inhibitors of COX-2 in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These clinical trials will help to elucidate the role of this interesting class.",Excluded
3808,Effects of prenatal ionizing irradiation on the development of the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina. Prenatal exposure to ionizing irradiation has been shown to be an effective method to eliminate selectively certain neuronal population. This investigation studied the effects on the ganglion cell layer of the retinae of adult mice exposed to a gamma source (total dose = 3 Gy) at 16 days gestation. There was a significant reduction in the total number of neurons (displaced amacrine + ganglion cells) in the ganglion cell layer (33%) that was mainly caused by a pronounced loss (59%) of displaced amacrine cells. The diameters of the surviving retinal ganglion cells were consistently larger than those of the controls. Prenatal irradiation is the first experimental approach that partially eliminates displaced amacrine cells. It is suggested that the morphogenesis of retinal ganglion cells may be affected by displaced amacrine cells. © 2001 ISDN.,Excluded
4132,"A case of multi-organ langerhans cell histiocytosis responsive to tobacco cessation. Background Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) may present with single or multi-organ involvement (lung, bone, pituitary gland, skin, lymph). Pulmonary LCH is nearly always associated with smoking and lesions may regress with tobacco cessation, which is considered the initial focus of therapy. Multi-organ LCH is thought to be more aggressive and treatment frequently requires systemic chemotherapy, radiation, or combination therapy. The following case illustrates a patient with multi-organ LCH presenting as a pathologic fracture, and describes simultaneous regression of both lung and bone lesions coinciding with tobacco cessation. Case A 32 year-old female with longstanding tobacco abuse, extensive tuberculosis exposure, prior residence in the California high desert, and family history of BRCA mutation presented following a low-impact fall with T4 vertebral pathologic fracture on MRI. She reported subjective fevers, dyspnea on exertion, and intermittent chest pain for two months prior. Exam was notable for tenderness to palpation over T4 and a papular facial rash. Basic laboratory evaluation was normal, but CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed: innumerable subcentimeter middle/upper lobe-predominant pulmonary nodules, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, ovary with two centimeter cystic structure, and the lytic T4 lesion. Broad differential diagnosis included malignancy, tuberculosis, disseminated fungal disease, and granulomatous disease. Technetium bone scan only revealed the isolated vertebral lesion. PPD and AFB blood cultures were negative. Lumbar puncture and breast/brain MRIs were unrevealing. Coccidiomycosis antibodies, tumor markers, ANA, HIV, hepatitis serologies, SPEP/UPEP, serum quantitative immunoglobulins, and ACE levels were all unremarkable. T4 lesion biopsy was initially thought risky due to aorta proximity, thus bronchoscopy was performed; lavage and transbronchial biopsies were non-diagnostic. Ensuing VATS biopsy specimen revealed bronchiole histiocyte aggregates, eosinophils, and positive CD1a/S100 stains (pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis). While follow-up outpatient vertebral biopsy did not confirm LCH bony involvement, disseminated LCH was assumed given her pathologic fracture. Radiation of the vertebral lesion was considered, but deferred when tobacco cessation over 1.5 years led to near-resolution of pulmonary nodules, regression of vertebral lesion, and diminished symptoms. The patient then began smoking again with subsequent recurrent pulmonary involvement, and a new humeral fracture with biopsy-proven LCH of the bone. Discussion This unique case of LCH demonstrates remission and relapse of multi-organ involvement, correlating temporally with cessation of and subsequent return to tobacco use. This is interesting given that unlike isolated pulmonary disease, the causative role of tobacco and response to smoking avoidance have not been previously described for multi-organ LCH.",Excluded
4625,"Dosimetric analysis of the brachial plexus among patients with breast cancer treated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy to the ipsilateral supraclavicular area: report of 3 cases of radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathy. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the brachial plexus (BP) dose of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) to the ipsilateral supraclavicular (ISCL) area, and report the characteristics of radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathy (RIBPN).METHODS: The BP dose of 31 patients who received adjuvant PMRT to the ISCL area and chest wall using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and the records of 3 patients with RIBPN were retrospectively analyzed based on the standardized Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-endorsed guidelines. The total dose to the ISCL area and chest wall was 50 Gy in 25 fractions.RESULTS: Patients with a higher number of removed lymph nodes (RLNs) had a higher risk of RIBPN (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.189, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.005-1.406, p = 0.044). In 31 patients treated with 3DCRT, the mean dose to the BP without irradiation to the ISCL area was significantly less than that with irradiation to the ISCL area (0.97 +/- 0.20 vs. 44.39 +/- 4.13 Gy, t = 136.75, p <0.001). In the 3DCRT plans with irradiation to the ISCL area and chest wall, the maximum dose to the BP was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.40, p = 0.026), body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.44, p = 0.014), and body weight (r = -0.45, p = 0.011). Symptoms of the 3 patients with RIBPN occurred 37-65 months after radiotherapy, and included progressive upper extremity numbness, pain, and motor disturbance. After treatment, 1 patient was stable, and the other 2 patients' symptoms worsened.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of RIBPN was higher in patients with a higher number of RLNs after PMRT. The dose to the BP is primarily from irradiation of the ISCL area, and is higher in slim and young patients. Prevention should be the main focus of managing RIBPN, and the BP should be considered an organ-at-risk when designing a radiotherapy plan for the ISCL area.",Excluded

4624,"Adaptive replanning strategies accounting for shrinkage in head and neck IMRT. PURPOSE: Significant anatomic and volumetric changes occur in head and neck cancer patients during fractionated radiotherapy, and the actual dose can be considerably different from the original plan. The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the differences between planned and delivered dose, (2) to investigate margins required for anatomic changes, and (3) to find optimal replanning strategies.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eleven patients, each with one planning and six weekly helical CTs, were included. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans were generated using the simultaneous integrated boost technique. Weekly CTs were rigidly registered to planning CT before deformable registration was performed. The following replanning strategies were investigated with different margins (0, 3, 5 mm): midcourse (one replan), every other week (two replans), and every week (six replans). Doses were accumulated on the planning CT for comparison of various dose indices for target and critical structures.RESULTS: The cumulative doses to targets were preserved even at the 0-mm margin. Doses to cord, brainstem, and mandible were unchanged. Significant increases in parotid doses were observed. Margin reduction from 5 to 0 mm led to a 22% improvement in parotid mean dose. Parotid sparing could be preserved with replanning. More frequent replanning led to better preservation; replanning more than once a week is unnecessary.CONCLUSION: Shrinkage does not result in significant dosimetric difference in targets and critical structures, except for the parotid gland, for which the mean dose increases by approximately 10%. The benefit of replanning is improved sparing of the parotid. The combination of replanning and reduced margins can provide up to a 30% difference in parotid dose.",Excluded
4173,"Collateral damage of radiation to normal tissues: What can the retina tell us?. Purpose : Damage to normal tissue in an irradiated field (normal tissue injury, NTI) is a complication of radiation therapy believed to be caused by microvessel pathology. In the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS), vascular pathology was described in uveal melanoma (UM) patients 2 years post-radiation therapy. However, the COMS and other studies used subjective scoring systems, lacked a control group, did not assess neuronal function in detail, and used dosimetry methods simplified for clinical application. Methods : Optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) was used to characterize vascular pathology by vessel density, fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) size, parafoveal density (PVD), and by machine learning-derived density maps. OCT-derived retinal layer thickness and 10-2 visual field testing (VF) were used to quantify corresponding neuronal loss and dysfunction. Patient-specific 3D dosimetry models were constructed to spatially correlate dose to each outcome measure. Measurements were taken in both eyes of 31 UM patients at 0.5-150 mo post-<sup>125</sup>I plaque brachytherapy, and 16 age-matched controls. Data were normalized to the contralateral eye to account for subject variation due to age or systemic disease. Results : Abnormal vessel density, FD, lacunarity, FAZ size, and PVD were observed after 24 mo in 25 out of 31 subjects, whereas only 6 subjects showed any vascular pathology before 24 mo. Visual acuity was the least sensitive indicator of adverse outcome, with only 16% of the entire population showing a visual decline of two or more Snellen lines since diagnosis. Neuronal dysfunction by VF correlated strongly with most measures, especially vessel density, thinning of the superficial retina, and radiation dose (p<0.001). Abnormalities were observed only at doses above 20 Gy. Conclusions : Using a series of quantitative approaches, radiation microvasculopathy was detected starting at 24 mo post-exposure in most patients. Strong correlations between loss of neuronal function, vascular pathology, and dose were observed. Prospective studies will help determine whether vascular pathology precedes neuronal loss.",Included

4128,"Dual-Phase Computed Tomography Angiography Enhances Detection of Contrast Extravasation in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage. Background: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) can be used to detect contrast extravasation in intracerebral hemorrhage. However, investigation for contrast extravasation in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is insufficient. We evaluated the efficacy of dual-phase CTA to improve evaluation of contrast extravasation in SAH. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated 35 patients with SAH who underwent contrast-enhanced dual-phase CTA within 24 hours from onset. The second-phase scan was performed 8 or 15 seconds following the usual CTA. The frequency of contrast extravasation was compared between phases. We also recorded the time from onset, coma level, interventional treatment, and early mortality. Result(s): Of 35 patients (22.9%) with SAH, 8 showed contrast extravasation in the second phase compared with 3 in the first phase. Contrast extravasation was correlated with clinical coma level (P < 0.05), and all contrast extravasation was found within 6 hours from onset. Early mortality, treatment decision, and hematoma distribution type did not correlate with existence of contrast extravasation. We also observed 4 cases of secondary subpial hematoma due to SAH, with 3 showing extravasation in both phases. Conclusion(s): Dual-phase CTA with a short interval enhances detection frequency of contrast extravasation in SAH and might be a better evaluation tool for SAH.

This article describes the diagnostic value of musculoskeletal sonography in the management of tendon pathology and outlines a clinical example of its scope of utilization. Herein we describe the case of a 65-year-old man who sought rehabilitation services for left groin pain following a period of intense trekking and uphill walking. He presented with left hip flexor weakness and local tenderness over the left iliopsoas tendon with negative findings on neurological evaluation. Additionally, he presented with left hip capsule and hip flexor tightness with left gluteus maximus and gluteus medius weakness. The left hip capsule tightness was predominantly in the posterior fibres, with restriction of hip internal rotation. The clinical picture overall was suggestive of the presence of risk parameters for iliopsoas tendinopathy. Plain radiographs of the hip revealed mild degenerative changes with a mild pincer impingement. While his clinical and radiological picture was suggestive of degenerative and soft tissue pathology of the hip, a real-time sonographic study was useful in the quantitative confirmation of a partial tear of the left iliopsoas tendon. Additionally, a repeat sonographic study performed four weeks later, revealed a healing iliopsoas tendon seen as a decrease in the width of the hypoechoic presentation of the tear. To summarize, the value of musculoskeletal sonography as a diagnostic tool as well as the assessment of the progression of tendon healing is discussed. Sonography is safe, noninvasive, and does not use ionizing radiation. It is steadily gaining popularity in the diagnosis of tendon lesions.",Excluded

Purpose To analyze the relationship between dosimetric characteristics and symptoms related to trigeminal neuropathy (TN) observed after radiosurgery (RS) for vestibular schwannomas (VS); to propose guidelines to optimize planification in VS RS regarding TN preservation; and to detail the mechanism of TN impairment after VS RS. Methods and Materials One hundred seventy-nine patients treated between 2011 and 2013 for VS RS and without trigeminal impairment before RS were included in a retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of TN among characteristics of the patients, the dosimetry, and the VS. Results There were 20 Koos grade 1, 99 grade 2, 57 grade 3, and 3 grade 4. Fourteen patients (7.8%) presented a transitory or permanent TN. Between the patients with and without TN after VS RS, there was no significant difference regarding dosimetry or VS volume itself. Significant differences (univariate analysis P<.05, Mann-Whitney test) were found for parameters related to the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve: total integrated dose, maximum dose, mean dose, volume of the Vth nerve (Vol<inf>v</inf>), and volume of the Vth nerve receiving at least 11 Gy (Vol<inf>Vcist>11Gy</inf>), but also for maximal dose to the Vth nerve nucleus and intra-axial portion (Dose max<inf>Vax</inf>).

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of spinal cord neoplasm caused by intrathecal stem cell transplantation in the setting of ""stem cell tourism."" BACKGROUND: Stem cell transplantation (SCT) into the neuraxis is being investigated as a potential therapy for a variety of neurologic conditions. However, studies to date have not demonstrated definitive benefit and reports have highlighted risks such as malignancy. Despite this, increasing numbers of individuals with neurologic disease are lured to international centers providing unregulated stem cell therapies, an industry termed ""stem cell tourism."" DESIGN: case report CASE: A 66-year-old man underwent multiple commercial infusions of stem cells (allogeneic, embryonic neural, and mesenchymal) at various sites around the world to treat deficits from an ischemic stroke. He subsequently developed progressive lower back pain, paraplegia, and urinary incontinence. MRI of the spine demonstrated an enhancing, intradural, extramedullary mass from T10 to the distal thecal sac encasing the cauda equina nerve roots and conus medullaris. RESULT(S): Histopathologic evaluation of biopsied tissue from T10 revealed two populations of cells: primitive-appearing atypical cells (~50[percnt] expressing SOX2; neural marker) and glial differentiated cells with vascular proliferation. Both populations demonstrated negative embryonic stem cell markers (OCT3/4) and leukocyte markers (CD45). Short tandem repeat molecular analysis showed 62 +/- 8 [percnt] of cells contained non-host DNA, most likely derived from one non-patient human. Oncopanel targeted exome DNA sequencing showed no pathogenic mutations. Radiation was administered with 48.6 Gy/27 fractions from C4 to thecal sac, delivered in 3 shrinking field doses. Subsequent imaging showed significant mass reduction and the patient reported improvement in right lower extremity mobility over the weeks following treatment.

This patient's highly proliferative neoplasm developing from pluripotent stem cells supports the ideological shift to employ more differentiated cells in future SCT research.",Excluded
4505,"Bidirectional regulation of fragile X mental retardation protein phosphorylation controls rhodopsin homoeostasis. Homoeostatic regulation of the light sensor, rhodopsin, is critical for the maintenance of light sensitivity and survival of photoreceptors. The major fly rhodopsin, Rh1, undergoes light-induced endocytosis and degradation, but its protein and mRNA levels remain constant during light/dark cycles. It is not clear how translation of Rh1 is regulated. Here, we show that adult photoreceptors maintain a constant, abundant quantity of ninaE mRNA, which encodes Rh1. We demonstrate that the Fmr1 protein associates with ninaE mRNA and represses its translation. Further, light exposure triggers a calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of Fmr1, which relieves suppression of Rh1 translation. We demonstrate that Mts, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), mediates light-induced Fmr1 dephosphorylation in a regulatory B subunit of PP2A (CKa)-dependent manner. Finally, we show that blocking light-induced Rh1 translation results in reduced light sensitivity.

Vemurafenib is known to cause severe cutaneous skin reactions such as phototoxicity and evidence is accumulating that RT may further enhance these side effects.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report two cases of unusual skin reactions occurring during and after treatment with a combination of vemurafenib and whole-brain irradiation in patients with cerebral metastases arising from malignant melanomas.RESULTS: One case report describes excessive acute radiodermatitis which arose during whole-brain irradiation in combination with vemurafenib. The second describes a late skin reaction occurring approximately 30 days after completion of RT.CONCLUSION: These two case reports show that combination of both treatment modalities is possible, but requires close monitoring of patients and good interdisciplinary collaboration.",Excluded
4662,"Prognostic grading system specifically for elderly patients with brain metastases after stereotactic radiosurgery: A 2-institution study. OBJECTIVE With the aging of the population, increasing numbers of elderly patients with brain metastasis (BM) are undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Among recently reported prognostic grading indexes, only the basic score for brain metastases (BSBM) is applicable to patients 65 years or older. However, the major weakness of this system is that no BM-related factors are graded. This prompted the authors to develop a new grading system, the elderly-specific (ES)-BSBM. METHODS For this IRB-approved, retrospective cohort study, the authors used their prospectively accumulated database comprising 3267 consecutive patients undergoing Gamma Knife SRS for BMs during the 1998-2016 period at the Mito GammaHouse. Among these 3267 patients, 1789 patients >= 65 years of age were studied (Yamamoto series [Y-series]). Another series of 1785 patients >= 65 years of age in whom Serizawa and colleagues performed Gamma Knife SRS during the same period (Serizawa series [S-series]) was used for validity testing of the ES-BSBM. RESULTS Two factors were identified as strongly impacting longer survival after SRS by means of multivariable analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model with a stepwise selection procedure. These factors are the number of tumors (solitary vs multiple: HR 1.450, 95% CI 1.299-1.621; p < 0.0001) and cumulative tumor volume (<= 15 cm<sup>3</sup> vs > 15 cm<sup>3</sup>: HR 1.311, 95% CI 1.078-1.593; p = 0.0067). The new index is the addition of scores 0 and 1 for these 2 factors to the BSBM. The ES-BSBM system is based on categorization into 3 classes by adding these 2 scores to those of the original BSBM. Each ES-BSBM category has 2 possible scores. For the category ES-BSBM 4-5, the score is either 4 or 5; for ES-BSBM 2-3, the score is either 2 or 3; and for ES-BSBM 0-1, the score is either 0 or 1. In the Y-series, the median survival times (MSTs, months) after SRS were 17.5 (95% CI 15.4-19.3) in ES-BSBM 4-5, 6.9 (95% CI 6.4-7.4) in ES-BSBM 2-3, and 2.8 (95% CI 2.5-3.6) in ES-BSBM 0-1 (p < 0.0001). Also, in the S-series, MSTs were, respectively, 20.4 (95% CI 17.2-23.4), 7.9 (95% CI 7.4-8.5), and 3.2 (95% CI 2.8-3.6) (p < 0.0001). The ES-BSBM system was shown to be applicable to patients with all primary tumor types as well as to those 80 years or older. CONCLUSIONS The authors found that the addition of the number of tumors and cumulative tumor volume as scoring factors to the BSBM system significantly improved the prognostic value of this index. The present study is strengthened by testing the ES-BSBM in a different patient group. Copyright ©AANS 2018.",Excluded
4658,"Automatic delineation algorithm of reference region for amyloid imaging based on kinetics. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an algorithm named AutoRef to delineate a reference region for quantitative PET amyloid imaging.METHODS: AutoRef sets the reference region automatically using a distinguishing feature in the kinetics of reference region. This is reflected in the shapes of the tissue time activity curve. A statistical shape recognition algorithm of the gaussian mixture model is applied with considering spatial and temporal information on a reference region. We evaluate the BP<sub>ND</sub> with manually set reference region and AutoRef using 86 cases (43 positive cases, 10 equivocal cases, and 33 negative cases) of dynamically scanned <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound-B.RESULTS: From the Bland-Altman plot, the difference between two BP<sub>ND</sub> is 0.099 +/- 0.21 as standard deviation, and no significant systematic error is observed between the BP<sub>ND</sub> with AutoRef and with manual definition of a reference region. Although a proportional error is detected, it is smaller than the 95% limits of agreement. Therefore, the proportional error is negligibly small.CONCLUSIONS: AutoRef presents the same performance as the manual definition of the reference region. Further, since AutoRef is more algorithmic than the ordinary manual definition of the reference region, there are few operator-oriented uncertainties in AutoRef. We thus conclude that AutoRef can be applied as an automatic delineating algorithm for the reference region in amyloid imaging.",Excluded
4102,"Mechanical allodynia induced by optogenetic sensory nerve excitation activates dopamine signaling and metabolism in medial nucleus accumbens. The mesolimbic dopaminergic signaling, such as that originating from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons in the medial part of the nucleus accumbens (mNAc), plays a role in complex sensory and affective components of pain. To date, we have demonstrated that optogenetic sensory nerve stimulation rapidly alters the dopamine (DA) content within the mNAc. However, the physiological role and biochemical processes underlying such rapid and regional dynamics of DA remain unclear. In this study, using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), we observed that sensitized pain stimulation by optogenetic sensory nerve activation increased DA and 3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT; a post-synaptic metabolite obtained following DA degradation) in the mNAc of the experimental mice. To delineate the mechanism associated with elevation of DA and 3-MT, the de novo synthesized DA in the VTA/substantia nigra terminal areas was evaluated using IMS by visualizing the metabolic conversion of stable isotope-labeled tyrosine (<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-Tyr) to DA. Our approach revealed that at steady state, the de novo synthesized DA occupied >10% of the non-labeled DA pool in the NAc within 1.5h of isotope-labeled Tyr administration, despite no significant increase following pain stimulation. These results suggested that sensitized pain triggered an increase in the release and postsynaptic intake of DA in the mNAc, followed by its degradation, and likely delayed de novo DA synthesis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that short, peripheral nerve excitation with mechanical stimulation accelerates the mNAc-specific DA signaling and metabolism which might be associated with the development of mechanical allodynia.",Excluded
4371,"Hyperbaric oxygen treatment of osteoradionecrosis of the mandible with repeated pathologic fracture. Report of a case. Treatment of patients with osteoradionecrosis of the mandible with a pathologic fracture consists in almost all cases of a continuity resection of the mandible. This leads to functional and esthetic problems that can only be solved by often extensive surgery. In this case report we present a 38-year-old woman who developed osteoradionecrosis of the mandible with a pathologic fracture 1 1/2 years after combined surgical and radiation therapy of an adenocarcinoma of the right parotid gland. The patient had a subcondylar pathologic fracture together with osteolysis in the right mandibular body, normally an indication for partial resection of the mandible. Because of the absence of denuded bone, fistulation, and the poor quality of the surrounding soft tissues, a more conservative approach was chosen. Treatment consisted of hyperbaric oxygen and dental extractions with alveolectomy with the patient under local anesthesia. During follow-up, a second pathologic fracture occurred in the region of the right first and second molar. No additional treatment was given. Six and one-half years after the initial treatment and 5 1/2 years after the last fracture, the patient is free of complaints, the fractures have healed and both esthetic and functional results are good.",Excluded

The loading schemes included no intervention, wearing a penguin suit, sleeping in a fetal position, wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position, reclining for 4 or 16 h/d, and maintaining upright posture for 4 or 16 h/d. <b>RESULTS:</b> Without intervention, the microgravity environment led to increased central pore pressure, radial displacement, and water content in the lumbar intervertebral disc. Wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position can reduce disc pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content to 0.156 MPa, 11.50 kPa, 0.538 mm, and 1.390%, respectively. When astronauts return to the gravity environment, staying upright for 4 h can reduce the pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content of the intervertebral disc to 0.222 MPa, 10.72 kPa, 0.373 mm, and 0.219%, respectively. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> This study showed that wearing a penguin suit and sleeping in the fetal position both have the potential to protect the lumbar intervertebral disc from the negative effects caused by microgravity. Remaining in the upright posture for 4 h per day may help squeeze out the water in the intervertebral disc safely when astronauts return to the gravity environment. <b>Zhang S, Wang K, Zhu R, Jiang C, Niu W.

Aim: To explore the absorptive effect of hirudo extract on experimental intracerebral hematoma in rats. Method(s): Group designed randomized control study was used in this study. Experimental intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH) models were established in rats by injection of quantitative collagenase into caudate nuclei. Effect of hirudo extract on the score of physical sign of neurologic impairment, hematoma volume, infarction volume, brain water content(BWC) of peripheral hematom tissues, histopathological changes including ordinary light microscope, electronic microscope and brain microangiography were observed.

4356,"Crumbs homologue 1 is required for maintenance of photoreceptor cell polarization and adhesion during light exposure. Loss of Crumbs homologue 1 (CRB1) function causes either the eye disease Leber congenital amaurosis or progressive retinitis pigmentosa, depending on the amount of residual CRB1 activity and the genetic background. Crb1 localizes specifically to the sub-apical region adjacent to the adherens junction complex at the outer limiting membrane in the retina. We show that it is associated here with multiple PDZ protein 1 (Mupp1), protein associated with Lin-7 (Pals1 or Mpp5) and Mpp4. We have produced Crb1(-/-) mice completely lacking any functional Crb1. Although the retinas are initially normal, by 3-9 months the Crb1(-/-) retinas develop localized lesions where the integrity of the outer limiting membrane is lost and giant half rosettes are formed. After delamination of the photoreceptor layer, neuronal cell death occurs in the inner and outer nuclear layers of the retina. On moderate exposure to light for 3 days at 3 months of age, the number of severe focal retinal lesions significantly increases in the Crb1(-/-) retina. Crb2, Crb3 and Crb1 interacting proteins remain localized to the sub-apical region and therefore are not sufficient to maintain cell adhesion during light exposure in Crb1(-/-) retinas. Thus we propose that during light exposure Crb1 is essential to maintain, but not assemble, adherens junctions between photoreceptors and Muller glia cells and prevents retinal disorganization and dystrophy. Hence, light may be an influential factor in the development of the corresponding human diseases.",Excluded

Background: Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) patients exhibit a higher prevalence of thromboembolic complications. We hypothesized that in this malignancy, procoagulant and inflammatory mediators contribute to the pathogenesis of such complications and warfarin may down regulate these levels. Method(s): In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, patients with inoperable lung cancer (n=100) were randomized to receive chemotherapy and radiation with and without warfarin (INR 1.5 - 2.5). Blood samples were drawn prior to and after the 2nd treatment cycle with warfarin or control and retrospectively analyzed for microparticles and thrombin generation markers such as fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment F1.2 (F1.2). In addition, biochip array for C-reactive protein (CRP), D Dimer, neuron specific enolase (NSE), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and thrombomodulin (TM) were measured. The results were compared with a normal population (N=50). Result(s): The microparticles were markedly increased in the SCLC patients (3 fold increase) at baseline. Similary, the thrombin generation markers showed variable increase (1.5-3.2 fold increase). In the biochip array analysis, variable increase was noted. CRP (2.4 fold), D DIMER (11.6 fold), NSE (1.8 fold), NGAL (1.7 fold), TNFR1 (2 fold) and TM (1.3 fold) were all increased as compared to normal controls. All of the markers exhibited a decrease after warfarin treatment with a most pronounced decrease in the D Dimer and TNFR1. Conclusion(s): These results validate the hypothesis that SCLC patients exhibit a hypercoagulable state that is associated with simultaneous upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Warfarin treatment results in a down regulation of these mediators. Our results provide a rationale for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in this group of patients.",Excluded
3806,"[Stereoradiotherapy of small brain lesions]. Stereoradiotherapy is the stereotaxy guided high-dose irradiation of small (less than 3 cm) intracerebral lesions. Its aim is to induce necrosis or sclerosis inside the target volume. Several techniques permit us to obtain a steep dose gradient between the lesion and the adjacent healthy cerebral parenchyma. They use minibeams (diameter less than 3 cm) of different types of radiations: protons (Kjellberg from Harvard, since 1962); gamma rays of cobalt 60 (Leksell from Stockholm, since 1968); and X-rays from a linear accelerator (Betti from Buenos-Aires, since 1982). The most commonly treated lesions are arterio-venous malformations, hypophyseal adenomas and low grade parenchymatous tumors. The stereotaxic technique is the only means by which to insure that these high dose irradiations, administered in a single session, are actually delivered to the small lesions situated in the cerebral parenchyma.",Excluded

Epileptiform discharge was recorded from neurons in the thalamic nuclei of chronic pain patients during stereotactic surgery. Hyperactive neurons showed regular firing of 3-5 trains of epileptic-like group discharges with a frequency of 4 to 5 Hz. As described by Lombard et al. (1979), we operated on the dorsal root unilaterally, sectioning C5 to Thl in male Wistar rats. One to three months after the operation, hyperactive neurons were examined in the contra-lateral thalamic nuclei (VP, zona incerta), and lemniscus medialis. The firing patterns and distribution of hyperactive neurons in these animals was very similar to those of humans. The hyperactive neuron was unaffected by electrical stimulation of the nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD) and locus ceruleus (LC). Administration of phenytoin and diazepam reduced the firing. However, no effect was seen with valproic acid. During spreading depression of the sensorimotor cortex, a remarkable reduction was seen on the firing of thalamic hyperactive neurons. This suggested that hyperactive neurons of the thalamic nuclei received facilitory effects from the sensorimotor cortex with little influence from adrenergic or serotoenergic systems.",Excluded

The Japanese quail is an excellent model for studying the mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement because of its distinct and marked response to changing photoperiods. Studies on this animal have suggested that the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) is an important centre controlling photoperiodic time measurement. Here we report that expression in the MBH of the gene encoding type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2), which catalyses the intracellular deiodination of thyroxine (T4) prohormone to the active 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), is induced by light in Japanese quail. Intracerebroventricular administration of T3 mimics the photoperiodic response, whereas the Dio2 inhibitor iopanoic acid prevents gonadal growth. These findings demonstrate that light-induced Dio2 expression in the MBH may be involved in the photoperiodic response of gonads in Japanese quail.",Excluded

Nucleoid halo diameters were measured to assay changes in DNA supercoiling in human brain tumor cell line SF-126 after irradiation under aerobic or hypoxic conditions. In unirradiated aerobic cells, a typical propidium iodide titration curve showed that with increasing concentrations of propidium iodide, the halo diameter increased and then decreased with the unwinding and subsequent rewinding of DNA supercoils. In irradiated cells, the rewinding of DNA supercoils was inhibited, resulting in an increased halo diameter, in a radiation dose-dependent manner. To produce equal increases in halo diameter required about a threefold higher radiation dose in hypoxic cells than in aerobic cells. Quantitatively similar differences in the radiation sensitivities of hypoxic and aerobic cells were demonstrated by a colony-forming efficiency assay. These findings suggest that the nucleoid halo assay may be used as a rapid measure of the inherent radiation sensitivity of human tumors.",Excluded

Research has been focused on the effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) emitted from a mobile phone on general health, especially the nervous system. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of RF-EMR on the brain mechanism of rats by recording local field potentials (LFPs) signals during working memory (WM) task. Subjects were exposed to 900 MHz from a dipole antenna daily for three hours. Exposure was applied, first on a short term base (1 week) and then on a long term base (4 weeks). Behavioral parameters were measured weekly while rats performed T-maze tasks in two types of normal and delayed. LFPs signals were simultaneously recorded by implanted microelectrode arrays on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats. Results showed a significant increase (*p < 0.05) in the task completion time of exposed rats which vanished shortly after the end of short term RF-EMR exposure. Before exposure, during correctly performed delayed tasks, an increase (peak) in power changes of theta band (4-12 Hz) was observed. But during correctly performed normal tasks, an increase appeared only by applying RF-EMR exposure. The similarity in power changes pattern of theta band in both types of tasks was observed after long term exposure. Classification accuracy of LFPs in truly done normal and delayed tasks was compared in pre and post-exposure states. Initial classification accuracy was 84.2 % which decreased significantly (*P < 0.05) after exposure. These observations indicated that RF-EMR may cause unusual brain functioning which is temporary at least for short term exposure. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

Specifically, a spatio-temporal correlation tensor that characterizes the anisotropy of fMRI signals in white matter was introduced to complement the estimation of fiber orientation density function from DWI. The proposed method has been demonstrated to identify functional pathways implicated in fMRI task. It can effectively follow tracts in the genu of the corpus callosum that connects to the frontal lobe cortex, obtain connections between the thalamus and the anterior insula under sensory simulation, and reconstruct optic radiations in the visual circuit under visual stimulation.

To understand the neural mechanisms underlying these physiological and psychological changes, it is critical to investigate the effects of microgravity on the functional architecture of the brain. In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to study whether the functional architecture of the brain is altered after 45 days of -6degree head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest, which is a reliable model for the simulation of microgravity. Sixteen healthy male volunteers underwent rs-fMRI scans before and after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Specifically, we used a commonly employed graph-based measure of network organization, i.e., degree centrality (DC), to perform a full-brain exploration of the regions that were influenced by simulated microgravity. We subsequently examined the functional connectivities of these regions using a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis. We found decreased DC in two regions, the left anterior insula (aINS) and the anterior part of the middle cingulate cortex (MCC; also called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in many studies), in the male volunteers after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Furthermore, seed-based RSFC analyses revealed that a functional network anchored in the aINS and MCC was particularly influenced by simulated microgravity. These results provide evidence that simulated microgravity alters the resting-state functional architecture of the brains of males and suggest that the processing of salience information, which is primarily subserved by the aINS-MCC functional network, is particularly influenced by spaceflight. The current findings provide a new perspective for understanding the relationships between microgravity, cognitive function, autonomic neural function, and central neural activity.",Excluded

Background: Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) may provide continuous, multiregional parenchymal bedside perfusion monitoring without the risks of patient transport, contrast, or radiation. Time-domain NIRS (TD-NIRS) uses pulsed light attenuation at multiple wavelengths (600-950 nm) to discretely quantify oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and determine total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation (OS) and cerebral blood volume (BV) in the region between each light source and detector. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of employing a novel TD-NIRS technology to assess absolute levels of cerebral BV and OS with broad spatial coverage in order to detect regions of ischemia. Method(s): Ischemic stroke (IS) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients underwent TD-NIRS measurements. IS patients were fitted with a rectangular probe over the region of ischemia (2 rows of 4 sources between 3 rows of 5 detectors), using CT as a guide (external acoustic meatus as reference). SAH patients were fitted with a linear ""anterior crown"" probe with light sources and detectors arranged alternating in a single row (7 sources, 6 detectors). Clearance above the frontal sinus was guided by CT imaging (nasion as reference). 1.8 cm separated all source-detector pairs. Time-correlated single photon-counting photomultiplier tubes detected photons to measure absorption of pulsed light emitted at 3 wavelengths (690, 805, and 835 nm). Maximal OS (OSmax) and BV (BVmax) were calculated for the entire region measured by the probe to enable multiple comparisons. Result(s): In IS patients, ischemic regions (n=4) had an OSmax of 65.8 SD 13.1; contralateral normal tissue had an OSmax of 85.3 SD 27.1 (paired t-test; p 0.14). Ischemic regions had a BVmax of 76.25 SD 24.17 compared with 104.0 SD 42.5 in contralateral normal tissue (p 0.18). Regional inspection showed good visual correlation with infarcts (Figure). Of SAH patients with serial measures (n=2), one developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bilateral infarcts, coincident with decreased BVmax on the right (72, day 1; 48, day 12) and left (153, day 1; 56, day 12); OS did not change. Conclusion(s): We were able to calculate multiregional BV and OS for patients with cerebral ischemia. Despite small sample size, we demonstrated a trend between contralateral (ischemic stroke) and historical (subarachnoid hemorrhage) controls.

The single most debilitating side effect was oropharyngeal mucositis that was characterized by patients as sore throat, and mouth sores and pain; both negatively affected the patient's ability to eat and drink, causing many patients to experience significant weight loss.

4054,"Therapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells can result from deregulated EGFR signaling. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with various downstream molecules including phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/GSK-3, Jak/STAT and others. Often these pathways are deregulated in human malignancies such as breast cancer. Various therapeutic approaches to inhibit the activity of EGFR family members including small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) have been developed. A common problem with cancer treatments is the development of drug-resistance. We examined the effects of a conditionally-activated EGFR (v-Erb-B:ER) on the resistance of breast cancer cells to commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-flurouracil as well as ionizing radiation (IR). v-Erb-B is similar to the EGFR-variant EGFRvIII, which is expressed in various cancers including breast, brain, prostate. Both v-Erb-B and EGFRvIII encode the EGFR kinase domain but lack key components present in the extracellular domain of EGFR which normally regulate its activity and ligand-dependence. The v-Erb-B oncogene was ligated to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) which results in regulation of the activity of the v-Erb-ER construct by addition of either estrogen (E2) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) to the culture media. Introduction of the v-Erb-B:ER construct into the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line increased the resistance to the cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs, hormonal-based therapeutics and IR.

3732,"An unusual natural history of metastatic basal cell carcinoma. Introduction: Basal Cell carcinoma (BCC), unlike other skin malignancies, rarely metastasizes with an incidence rate ranging between 0.0028 and 0.55%. Less than 400 cases have been reported in the literature over the past 120 years.We present a rare case of BCC that had recurrent metastasis in the lung over a period of 17 years. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is an 89 year old male with a history of BCC of the forehead resected 17 years ago. Eight years later, he presented with solitary pulmonary nodule confirmed to be metastatic BCC. He underwent wedge resection of the right lower lobe followed by radiation due to local recurrence. He now presented with numbness of the right hand worsened by deep inspiration. The patient denied fever, cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, chest pain or shortness of breath. His other medical history included hypertension and COPD.Chest Xray showed right middle lobe infiltrate and elevated hemi diaphragm. CT scan of the chest without contrast demonstrated, right middle lobe pneumonia and a 2.5cm nodule in the left apex. He was treated with antibiotics and a subsequent CT chest with contrast confirmed only a spiculated mass in the left apex. CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis and brain was unremarkable.PET-CT scan showed a hypermetabolic 2.3cm apical nodule with irregular border and SUV of 12.6, suspicious for a primary lung neoplasm. He had a CT guided biopsy and frozen section demonstrated malignant cells. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the lesion to be a metastatic BCC, morphologically similar to the primary BCC diagnosed 17 years. DISCUSSION: BCC is usually a slow growing, locally destructive lesion with excellent prognosis. On the other hand, metastatic BCC is very aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. The median time for metastasis from onset of initial lesion is about 9 years.The size of the initial tumor and local recurrence appear to predict the likelihood of metastatic disease.The metastasis can be either regional (RM) or distant (DM). Lung is a common site for distant metastasis .The median survival with DM is 24 months in comparison to 87 months with RM. This particular patient however survived for more than 8 years since his metastatic disease was first diagnosed. Conclusion(s): Metastatic BCC is a rare entity. Although historically associated with a poor prognosis, the natural history of metastatic BCC might not be as grim as reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the longest surviving patient with metastatic BCC ever reported. More research is necessary to better characterize favorable factors in metastatic BCC and find out the sub-group of patients who would greatly benefit from aggressive therapy.",Excluded
3780,"The role of tumor vascularity in predicting survival after yttrium-90 radioembolization for liver metastases. PURPOSE: It is unclear what role pretreatment tumor vascularity plays in determining outcomes after yttrium-90 radioembolization. A hypothesis was tested that radiographic vascularity of a tumor does not affect patient survival.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this two-institution retrospective study, 137 patients with metastatic liver disease underwent (90)Y radioembolization. Primary sites were categorized as colon, neuroendocrine, and other. All patients underwent triphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging, as well as detailed hepatic angiography. Two board-certified interventional radiologists interpreted all images and evaluated them for the presence of enhancement. Median survival times, as well as 1- and 2-year survival rates, were compared between patients with hypervascular and hypovascular tumors on (i) cross-sectional imaging and (ii) angiography with use of the log-rank statistic (alpha = 0.05).RESULTS: On angiography, 108 patients had hypervascular tumors and 29 had hypovascular tumors. Median survival times for the two subgroups were 300 days and 261 days, respectively (P = .95). On CT, 24 patients had hypervascular tumors and 113 had hypovascular tumors. Median survival times for these subgroups were 306 days and 284 days, respectively (P = .67). Eighty-four patients' tumors that were hypovascular on CT were hypervascular on angiography. There were no statistical differences in survival between patients with hypervascular and hypovascular tumors, regardless if vascularity was defined based on CT or angiography.CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic vascular appearance of liver tumors, regardless of imaging modality, does not affect survival after radioembolization. Therefore, hypovascular tumors should not be considered contraindicated for radioembolization.",Excluded
4482,"The progress in research on changes of central venous pressure under simulated weightlessness and microgravity. [Chinese]. One of the most profound circulatory changes that occur in man during exposure to microgravity is a cephalad redistribution of fluid. Central venous pressure (CVP) is not only an important standard for determining the cephalad redistribution of fluid but also the unique valuable means for measuring continuously cardiac filling pressure under simulated weightlessness (SW) and microgravity, and has a relationship with neurohumoral [correction of nerohumoral] regulation. With the development of manned spaceflight, the researches in space suggested that CVP did not increase, which is directly contradictory to the previous results under SW. This paper mainly discusses the changes of CVP and the effects of countermeasures on CVP under SW and microgravity, and the mechanisms of decreased CVP under microgravity. It is postulated that more suitable SW models, more studies about the area of low pressure including especially pulmonary circulation, and comprehensive studies in multiple systems are needed.",Excluded
4639,"Cognitive impairment and spontaneous epilepsy in rats with malformations of cortical development. Purpose: To examine the cognition, spontaneous epilepsy, and electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics of rats with malformations of cortical development (MCD) and their use as an animal model for investigating the pathogenesis of intractable epilepsy and screening novel antiepileptic drugs. Method(s): An epileptic rat model of MCD was established with the F1 generation of pregnant rats after X-irradiation with 175 cGy (Group L), 195 cGy (Group M), or 215 cGy (Group H). Long-term video-EEG monitoring was used to record the seizures in the rats with MCD. Cognition was assessed with the Morris water maze. The EEGs were recorded and analyzed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats. Finally, the brain tissues were processed for Nissl staining. Result(s): The model groups exhibited markedly prolonged escape latencies and distinct decrements in the percent distance traveled in the target quadrant and platform-crossing frequency. These findings were dose-dependent. Frequent interictal epileptiform discharges were observed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats, and their incidences were markedly higher in the model groups compared with that in the normal controls, with Group M having the highest incidence. Spontaneous seizures were observed in the model groups (mean incidence, 46.7%). The daily mean frequency of seizures and the incidence of spontaneous seizures were highest in Group M. Nissl staining revealed a dose-dependent pattern of hippocampal abnormalities, cortical and subcortical nodular heterotopia, and callosal agenesis in the model groups. Conclusion(s): The 195 cGy dose was most appropriate for establishing an epileptic model of MCD with X-irradiation. Copyright © 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

4308,"Tm:fiber laser ablation with real-time temperature monitoring for minimizing collateral thermal damage: ex vivo dosimetry for ovine brain. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The thermal damage of the surrounding tissue can be an unwanted result of continuous-wave laser irradiations. In order to propose an effective alternative to conventional surgical techniques, photothermal damage must be taken under control by a detailed dose study. Real-time temperature monitoring can be also an effective way to get rid of these negative effects. The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of a new laser-thermoprobe, which consists of a continuous-wave 1,940-nm Tm:fiber laser and a thermocouple measurement system for brain surgery in an ex vivo study.STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: A laser-thermoprobe was designed for using the near-by tissue temperature as a real-time reference for the applicator. Fresh lamb brain tissues were used for experiments. 320 laser shots were performed on both cortical and subcortical tissue.RESULTS: The relationship between laser parameters, temperature changes, and ablation (removal of tissue) efficiency was determined. The correlation between rate of temperature change and ablation efficiency was calculated.CONCLUSION: Laser-thermoprobe leads us to understand the basic laser-tissue interaction mechanism in a very cheap and easy way, without making a change in the experimental design. It was also shown that the ablation and coagulation (thermally irreversible damage) diameters could be predicted, and carbonization can be avoided by temperature monitoring.",Excluded
4056,"Effects of twenty-minute 3G mobile phone irradiation on event related potential components and early gamma synchronization in auditory oddball paradigm. We investigated the potential effects of 20 min irradiation from a new generation Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) 3G mobile phone on human event related potentials (ERPs) in an auditory oddball paradigm. In a double-blind task design, subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. Before and after irradiation subjects were presented with a random series of 50 ms tone burst (frequent standards: 1 kHz, P=0.8, rare deviants: 1.5 kHz, P=0.2) at a mean repetition rate of 1500 ms while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The subjects' task was to silently count the appearance of targets. The amplitude and latency of the N100, N200, P200 and P300 components for targets and standards were analyzed in 29 subjects. We found no significant effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) irradiation on the amplitude and latency of the above ERP components. In order to study possible effects of EMF on attentional processes, we applied a wavelet-based time-frequency method to analyze the early gamma component of brain responses to auditory stimuli. We found that the early evoked gamma activity was insensitive to UMTS RF exposition. Our results support the notion, that a single 20 min irradiation from new generation 3G mobile phones does not induce measurable changes in latency or amplitude of ERP components or in oscillatory gamma-band activity in an auditory oddball paradigm.",Excluded

4615,"Processing of modulated sounds in the zebra finch auditory midbrain: responses to noise, frequency sweeps, and sinusoidal amplitude modulations. The avian auditory midbrain nucleus, the mesencephalicus lateralis, dorsalis (MLd), is the first auditory processing stage in which multiple parallel inputs converge, and it provides the input to the auditory thalamus. We studied the responses of single MLd neurons to four types of modulated sounds: 1) white noise; 2) band-limited noise; 3) frequency modulated (FM) sweeps, and 4) sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones (SAM) in adult male zebra finches. Responses were compared with the responses of the same neurons to pure tones in terms of temporal response patterns, thresholds, characteristic frequencies, frequency tuning bandwidths, tuning sharpness, and spike rate/intensity relationships. Most neurons responded well to noise. More than one-half of the neurons responded selectively to particular portions of the noise, suggesting that, unlike forebrain neurons, many MLd neurons can encode specific acoustic components of highly modulated sounds such as noise. Selectivity for FM sweep direction was found in only 13% of cells that responded to sweeps. Those cells also showed asymmetric tuning curves, suggesting that asymmetric inhibition plays a role in FM directional selectivity. Responses to SAM showed that MLd neurons code temporal modulation rates using both spike rate and synchronization. Nearly all cells showed low-pass or band-pass filtering properties for SAM. Best modulation frequencies matched the temporal modulations in zebra finch song. Results suggest that auditory midbrain neurons are well suited for encoding a wide range of complex sounds with a high degree of temporal accuracy rather than selectively responding to only some sounds.",Excluded

4405,"Role of nanomedicine in treatment of brain cancer. Background: Drug delivery to cancerous brain is a challenging task as it is surrounded by an efficient protective barrier. The main hurdles for delivery of bioactive molecules to cancerous brain are blood brain barrier (BBB), the invasive nature of gliomas, drug resistance, and difficult brain interstitium transportation. Therefore, treatment of brain cancer with the available drug regimen is difficult and has shown little improvement in recent years. Method(s): We searched about recent advancements in the use of nanomedicine for effective treatment of the brain cancer. We focused on the use of liposomes, nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers to improve brain cancer therapy. Result(s): Nanomedicines are well suited for the treatment of brain cancer owing to their highly acceptable biological, chemical, and physical properties. Smaller size of nanomedicines also enhances their anticancer potential and penetration into blood brain barrier (BBB). Conclusion(s): Recently, nanomedicine based approaches have been developed and investigated for effective treatment of brain cancer. Some of these have been translated into clinical practice, in order to attain therapeutic needs of gliomas. Future advancements in nanomedicines will likely produce significant changes in methods and practice of brain cancer therapy. Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.",Excluded
4339,"Non-coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for craniopharyngiomas reduces radiation doses to the bilateral hippocampus: a planning study comparing dynamic conformal arc therapy, coplanar VMAT, and non-coplanar VMAT. BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that radiation-induced injuries to the hippocampus play important roles in compromising neurocognitive functioning for patients with brain tumors and it could be important to spare the hippocampus using modern planning methods for patients with craniopharyngiomas. As bilateral hippocampus are located on the same level as the planning target volume (PTV) in patients with craniopharyngioma, it seems possible to reduce doses to hippocampus using non-coplanar beams. While the use of non-coplanar beams in volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) of malignant intracranial tumors has recently been reported, no dosimetric comparison has yet been made between VMAT using non-coplanar arcs (ncVMAT) and VMAT employing only coplanar arcs (coVMAT) among patients with craniopharyngiomas. We performed a planning study comparing dose distributions to the PTV, hippocampus, and other organs at risk (OAR) of dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), coVMAT, and ncVMAT.METHODS: DCAT, coVMAT, and ncVMAT plans were created for 10 patients with craniopharyngiomas. The prescription dose was 52.2 Gy in 29 fractions, and 99 % of each PTV was covered by 90 % of the prescribed dose. The maximum dose was held below 107 % of the prescribed dose. CoVMAT and ncVMAT plans were formulated to satisfy the following criteria: the doses to the hippocampus were minimized, and the doses to the OAR were similar to or lower than those of DCAT.RESULTS: The mean equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractions to 40 % of the volumes of the bilateral hippocampus [EQD2(40%hippos)] were 15.4/10.8/6.5 Gy for DCAT/coVMAT/ncVMAT, respectively. The EQD2(40%hippos) for ncVMAT were <7.3 Gy, which is the threshold predicting cognitive impairment, as defined by Gondi et al.. The mean doses to normal brain tissue and the conformity indices were similar for the three plans, and the homogeneity indices were significantly better for coVMAT and ncVMAT compared with DCAT.CONCLUSIONS: NcVMAT is more appropriate than DCAT and coVMAT for patients with craniopharyngiomas. NcVMAT significantly reduces radiation doses to the bilateral hippocampus (to 50 % that of the DCAT) without increasing the doses to normal brain tissue and other OAR.",Excluded
4435,"Interstitial irradiation with stereotactically implanted I-125 seeds for the treatment of cerebral glioma. Owing to its low rate of side effects and its high efficacy, interstitial irradiation with low-activity seeds should be the first therapeutic step in small (maximal diameter 40 mm), well-circumscribed, low-grade gliomas affecting the brain stem, other midline structures, or eloquent cerebral areas. In anaplastic gliomas, a therapeutic schedule using low-activity seeds and combining interstitial irradiation with radiotherapy (reduced boost dose of 15-30 Gy) seems to be more effective than interstitial irradiation alone. Compared with interstitial irradiation with high-activity seeds, this combined irradiation schedule caused no space-occupying radiation necrosis. Thus, it can be recommended as up-front treatment in patients with small (maximal diameter <40 mm) inoperable anaplastic gliomas. The use of high-activity I-125 seeds and interstitial irradiation at comparably high dose rates, integrating a small penumbra of normal brain tissue into the treatment volume, improved survival significantly in patients with primary highly malignant gliomas. In patients with recurrent tumors, the same treatment schedule did not substantially prolong survival compared with results obtained after resection plus radiotherapy. Owing to the high frequency of space-occupying radiation necrosis (40-60%), this schedule is only applicable in surgically accessible tumors. The application of low-activity I-125 seeds (in primary glioblastomas in combination with radiotherapy, in recurrent tumors without radiotherapy) yielded a median survival comparable with conventionally treated patients. There was no need for reoperation because of radiation necrosis. Thus, this treatment schedule is useful in both operable and surgically inaccessible glioblastomas.",Excluded
3938,"Multisensory integration in the dorsal cochlear nucleus: unit responses to acoustic and trigeminal ganglion stimulation. A necessary requirement for multisensory integration is the convergence of pathways from different senses. The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) receives auditory input directly via the VIIIth nerve and somatosensory input indirectly from the Vth nerve via granule cells. Multisensory integration may occur in DCN cells that receive both trigeminal and auditory nerve input, such as the fusiform cell. We investigated trigeminal system influences on guinea pig DCN cells by stimulating the trigeminal ganglion while recording spontaneous and sound-driven activity from DCN neurons. A bipolar stimulating electrode was placed into the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized guinea pigs using stereotaxic co-ordinates. Electrical stimuli were applied as bipolar pulses (100 micros per phase) with amplitudes ranging from 10 to 100 microA. Responses from DCN units were obtained using a 16-channel, four-shank electrode. Current pulses were presented alone or preceding 100- or 200-ms broadband noise (BBN) bursts. Thirty percent of DCN units showed either excitatory, inhibitory or excitatory-inhibitory responses to trigeminal ganglion stimulation. When paired with BBN stimulation, trigeminal stimulation suppressed or facilitated the firing rate in response to BBN in 78% of units, reflecting multisensory integration. Pulses preceding the acoustic stimuli by as much as 95 ms were able to alter responses to BBN. Bimodal suppression may play a role in attenuating body-generated sounds, such as vocalization or respiration, whereas bimodal enhancement may serve to direct attention in low signal-to-noise environments.",Excluded
4767,"The inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced neuronal apoptosis via AMPKalpha1 signaling-mediated autophagy. Purpose/Objective(s): In our previous study, we have found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis shortly after radiation. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the detailed mechanisms underlying the protective effect of minocycline on neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis. Purpose/Objective(s): The immortalized mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cell line was used. The protective effect of minocycline on X-irradiated HT22 cells was demonstrated using clonogenic assay and apoptosis analysis. The underlying mechanisms were explored by using methods such as flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, shRNA knockdown, Western blot et al. Result(s): We found that minocycline protected HT22 hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced cell death, manifest as increased clonogenic cell survival and decreased apoptosis in irradiated cells. This protective effect of minocycline might involve cell cycle perturbation after radiation, but not DNA damage and repair. Further investigation showed that X-irradiation activated AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy, and minocycline significantly enhanced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of minocycline might not be involved in the enhancing effect of minocycline on radiation-induced autophagy, but it might at least partially contribute to the inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced apoptosis. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis mainly through targeting radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included

Abstract: Conjugation or fusion to AlbudAbsTM (albumin-binding domain antibodies) is a novel approach to extend the half-life and alter the tissue distribution of biological and small molecule therapeutics. To understand extravasation kinetics and extravascular organ concentrations of AlbudAbs in humans, we studied tissue distribution and elimination of a non-conjugated <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled AlbudAb in healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Method(s): A non-conjugated AlbudAb (GSK3128349) was radiolabeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr and a single 1 mg (~ 15 MBq) dose intravenously administered to eight healthy males. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb tissue distribution was followed for up to 7 days with four whole-body PET/CT scans. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb tissue concentrations were quantified in organs of therapeutic significance, measuring standardized uptake value and tissue/plasma ratios. Plasma pharmacokinetics were assessed by gamma counting and LC-MS/MS of blood samples. Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb administration and PET/CT procedures were well tolerated, with no drug-related immunogenicity or adverse events. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb rapidly distributed throughout the vasculature, with tissue/plasma ratios in the liver, lungs, and heart relatively stable over 7 days post-dose, ranging between 0.1 and 0.5. The brain tissue/plasma ratio of 0.025 suggested minimal AlbudAb blood-brain barrier penetration. Slowly increasing ratios in muscle, testis, pancreas, and spleen reflected either slow AlbudAb penetration and/or <sup>89</sup>Zr residualization in these organs. Across all tissues evaluated, the kidney tissue/plasma ratio was highest (0.5-1.5 range) with highest concentration in the renal cortex. The terminal half-life of the <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb was 18 days. Conclusion(s): Evaluating the biodistribution of <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb in healthy volunteers using a low radioactivity dose was successful (total subject exposure ~ 10 mSv). Results indicated rapid formation of reversible, but stable, complexes between AlbudAb and albumin upon dosing. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb demonstrated albumin-like pharmacokinetics, including limited renal elimination.

OBJECTIVE: To obtain high-quality positron emission tomography (PET) image with low-dose tracer injection, this study attempts to predict the standard-dose PET (S-PET) image from both its low-dose PET (L-PET) counterpart and corresponding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).METHODS: It was achieved by patch-based sparse representation (SR), using the training samples with a complete set of MRI, L-PET and S-PET modalities for dictionary construction. However, the number of training samples with complete modalities is often limited. In practice, many samples generally have incomplete modalities (i.e., with one or two missing modalities) that thus cannot be used in the prediction process. In light of this, we develop a semisupervised tripled dictionary learning (SSTDL) method for S-PET image prediction, which can utilize not only the samples with complete modalities (called complete samples) but also the samples with incomplete modalities (called incomplete samples), to take advantage of the large number of available training samples and thus further improve the prediction performance.RESULTS: Validation was done on a real human brain dataset consisting of 18 subjects, and the results show that our method is superior to the SR and other baseline methods.CONCLUSION: This paper proposed a new S-PET prediction method, which can significantly improve the PET image quality with low-dose injection.SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed method is favorable in clinical application since it can decrease the potential radiation risk for patients.",Excluded
4389,"Against Repurposing Methadone for Glioblastoma Therapy. Methadone, which is used as maintenance medication for outpatient treatment of opioid dependence or as an analgesic drug, has been suggested by preclinical in vitro and mouse studies to induce cell death and sensitivity to chemo- or radiotherapy in leukemia, glioblastoma, and carcinoma cells. These data together with episodical public reports on long-term surviving cancer patients who use methadone led to a hype of methadone as an anti-cancer drug in social and public media. However, clinical evidence for a tumoricidal effect of methadone is missing and prospective clinical trials, except in colorectal cancer, are not envisaged because of the limited preclinical data available. The present article reviews the pharmacokinetics, potential molecular targets, as well as the evidence for a tumoricidal effect of methadone in view of the therapeutically achievable doses in the brain.

4352,"A role for hydrolysis of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in terminating the response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and to a flash of light in Limulus ventral photoreceptors. Injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 1,4,5-P3) into Limulus ventral photoreceptors produces excitation similar to that produced by light. One process which might contribute to rapid termination of the responses to Ins 1,4,5-P3 and to light is the hydrolysis of Ins 1,4,5-P3 by an InsP3-5-phosphatase to form inositol 1,4-bisphosphate. Inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins 2,4,5-P3) is known to be less hydrolysable by the InsP3-5-phosphatase than is Ins 1,4,5-P3. Whereas ventral photoreceptors respond to an injection of Ins 1,4,5-P3 with a single wave of depolarization, the response to Ins 2,4,5-P3 is a burst of waves of depolarization. Our hypothesis is that it is the resistance to hydrolysis by the InsP3-5-phosphatase which accounts for the burst of waves produced by Ins 2,4,5-P3. To test this idea we injected ventral photoreceptors with Ins 1,4,5-P3 in the presence of the non-specific phosphatase inhibitors, vanadate and fluoride, which prolong the response to a flash of light in ventral photoreceptors (D.W. Corson, A. Fein, W.W. Walthall, J. Gen. Physiol. 82 (1983) 659-677). In the presence of fluoride or vanadate the response to Ins 1,4,5-P3 was composed of a burst of waves rather than a single wave of depolarization.

Quel que soit le stade, une irradiation cranienne propylactique est proposee chez les repondeurs. Le traitement de deuxieme ligne fait appel a la reintroduction de la chimiotherapie initiale en cas de CPC considere comme chimiosensible, et a une monotherapie, le topotecan, dans les CPC refractaires. Il n'existe actuellement aucune place pour les therapies ciblees en routine. Conclusions et perspectives: Compte tenu de la diminution de l'incidence du CPC, le nombre d'essais s'interessant aux CPC est egalement moindre. Des questions restent cependant irresolues et de meilleurs resultats de survie peuvent encore etre esperes. Actuellement, les efforts sont surtout tournes vers le demantelement moleculaire des CPC et le developpement de therapies ciblees en miroir des modifications biologiques identifiees. Introduction: It is recommended to use both the TNM classification and the Veterans Administration Lung Cancer Study Group classification to stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Treatment strategies can in most cases be pragmatically based on the limited (LS) versus extensive stage (ES) definitions. State of the Art: First line treatment of ES SCLC is chemotherapy, and particularly the cisplatin-etoposide combination. In LS SCLC, chemotherapy and early thoracic irradiation (preferentially hyper-fractionated accelerated radiotherapy) is standard treatment. Prophylactic cranial irradiation has been shown to prolong survival in responders with both LS and ES disease. Second line treatment consists of reintroduction of the firstline chemotherapy regimen in chemosensitive tumors. In patients with refractory SCLC, single-agent topotecan can be given as second line treatment. There is no indication for targeted therapy outside clinical trials. Conclusion(s): Because of a reduction in the proportion of SCLC, the number of trials addressing SCLC is decreasing. However, there are still many unanswered questions and better survival results are needed. Efforts for molecular subtyping of SCLC are ongoing, with the parallel search for therapies targeting the identified biomarkers. 2013 SPLF. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to prospectively characterize toxicity and cosmesis after accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (CRT) or single-entry, multilumen, intracavitary brachytherapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 281 patients with pTis, pT1N0, or pT2N0 (<=3.0 cm) breast cancer treated with segmental mastectomy were prospectively enrolled from December 2008 through August 2014. APBI was delivered using 3-dimensional CRT (n = 29) or with SAVI (n = 176), Contura (n = 56), or MammoSite (n = 20) brachytherapy catheters. Patients were evaluated at protocol-specified intervals, at which time the radiation oncologist scored cosmetic outcome, toxicities, and recurrence status using a standardized template.RESULTS: The median follow-up time is 41 months. Grade 1 seroma and fibrosis were more common with brachytherapy than with 3-dimensional CRT (50.4% vs 3.4% for seroma; P < .0001 and 66.3% vs 44.8% for fibrosis; P = .02), but grade 1 edema was more common with 3-dimensional CRT than with brachytherapy (17.2% vs 5.6%; P = .04). Grade 2 to 3 pain was more common with 3-dimensional CRT (17.2% vs 5.2%; P = .03). Actuarial 5-year rates of fair or poor radiation oncologist-reported cosmetic outcome were 9% for 3-dimensional CRT and 24% for brachytherapy (P = .13). Brachytherapy was significantly associated with inferior cosmesis on mixed model analysis (P = .003). Significant predictors of reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy were D0.1cc (skin) <=102%, minimum skin distance >5.1 mm, dose homogeneity index >0.54, and volume of nonconformance <=0.89 cc. The 5-year ipsilateral breast recurrence was 4.3% for brachytherapy and 4.2% for 3-dimensional CRT APBI patients (P = .95).CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy APBI is associated with higher rates of grade 1 fibrosis and seroma than 3-dimensional CRT but lower rates of grade 1 edema and grade 2 to 3 pain than 3-dimensional CRT. Rates of radiation oncologist-reported fair or poor cosmetic outcomes are higher with brachytherapy. We identified dosimetric parameters that predict reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy-based APBI.

Objectives: We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) on patients with surgically resected small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Patients and Methods: Between January 2003 and December 2009, the records of completely resected patients who were diagnosed with SCLC and definitive pTNM stage on the basis of histological proof were reviewed. According to the therapy modality, patients were allocated to PCI group and non-PCI group. Result(s): A total of 193 patients were finally included, 67 patients in PCI group and 126 in non-PCI group. The OS rates at 2-year and 5-year in PCI group were 92.5%, and 54.9%, respectively, and those of non-PCI were 63.2% and 47.8%, respectively (. p=. 0.005). The BMFS rate at 2-year and 5-year in PCI group was significantly better than those of non-PCI group (96.8%, 76.6% and 79.4%, 75.5%, respectively, p=. 0.014). But PCI could not confer survival benefit in the patients with p-stage I. Multivariate analysis revealed that PCI (HR. =. 2.339; p=. 0.001) was an independent prognostic factor of the overall survival.

CONTEXT: Radiotherapy is frequently administered as adjuvant treatment in patients with clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). However, concerns have been raised about potential long-term side effects, including cerebrovascular events (CVEs) and secondary intracranial tumors.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality in irradiated (IRR) NFPA patients, compared with NFPA patients who were not irradiated (non-IRR).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The study cohort included 806 patients with a NFPA from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults, a nationwide long-term surveillance study in severe GH-deficient adult patients. IRR patients (n = 456) were compared with non-IRR patients (n = 350).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality were measured.RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects developed a CVE. In men, but not in women, the incidence of a CVE was significantly higher in IRR patients than in non-IRR patients (hazard ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 1.31-6.79). A secondary intracranial tumor developed in five IRR patients and two non-IRR patients. After adjustment for age, radiotherapy was not associated with mortality.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of secondary intracranial tumors and mortality did not differ between IRR and non-IRR patients. However, a CVE was found significantly more frequently in IRR men but not in women. Further research into the long-term effects of cranial radiotherapy seems mandatory. The potential risks of radiotherapy have to be taken into account when radiotherapy is considered in NFPA patients, and long-term follow-up is recommended.",Included
3985,"Revolution in Radiation. In the past few decades, there have been many changes in the field of radiotherapy. These include better imaging, better motion management, improvements in treatment planning, better position verification and more precise treatment delivery. This has led to an increased use of radiotherapy and to significant improvements in clinical outcome. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT, aka SABR) is currently the standard of care for patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC. The technique is now safely used for more centrally located, larger and multiple lesions as well. SBRT is increasingly being considered as an alternative to surgery in operable patients. The results of two randomized clinical trials which were closed prematurely due to poor accrual, suggest equivalence between SBRT and surgery. Comparative effectiveness studies point in the same direction. New randomized trials on this topic are currently recruiting. In stage III NSCLC, radiotherapy can also be delivered with increased precision. Although the use of much higher dose has not (yet) led to better outcomes, the newer radiation techniques are associated with less toxicity and over the years, there has been a steady improvement in control and survival rates. The use of immunotherapy in combination with radiotherapy holds many promises. The role of proton therapy is still investigational. For patients with oligometastatic disease or oligoprogression, local treatments including radiotherapy can be highly effective and may lead to long term control and improvements in survival. We are awaiting the results of randomized studies to unequivocally show this benefit. In LS-SCLC, there is still discussion on the schemes for thoracic radiotherapy (BID or QD). The improvement in median survival in both arms of the recent CONVERT trial compared to earlier studies are probably exemplary for the general improvements in radiotherapy techniques. In ES-SCLC patients, thoracic radiotherapy is advocated for those patients with a response after chemotherapy but with residual disease in their chest. In ES-SCLC, prophylactic cranial irradiation is nowadays sometimes replaced with MRI-surveillance. Delayed cranial irradiation is than used in about two out of three patients. An important breakthrough in radiotherapy is the introduction of MRI guidance on the linear accelerator. This not only provides better soft-tissue imaging, but also for the first time, continuous imaging during the delivery of the treatment. The anatomical information from the MRI made daily with the patient on the treatment couch can be used to daily adapt the treatment plan. This allows for the use of smaller margins and early results demonstrate important benefits, especially in high-risk patients.

4080,"Patterns of Failure after Stereotactic Radiosurgery of the Resection Cavity Following Surgical Removal of Brain Metastases. BACKGROUND: Whole brain radiation treatment (WBRT) is considered standard treatment for BM. However, exposing large volumes of normal brain tissue to irradiation can cause neurotoxicity. This study describes our experience with 100 consecutive patients with brain metastases who were managed with surgical extirpation followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity.METHODS: Patients with 1-3 brain metastases (BM), who underwent resection of 1-2 BM between June 2005 and December 2013, were treated with SRS directed to the tumor cavity and for any synchronous BM. Local and distant treatment failures were determined based on neuroimaging. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for local and distant failure rates and overall survival.RESULTS: One hundred and two resection cavities were treated with SRS in 100 consecutive patients. Thirty-two additional synchronous metastases were treated in 27 patients during the same session. The median overall survival was 18.9 months. Local control rate at 1 year was 84%. Longer delays between surgery and SRS were associated with increased risk of local failure (hazard ratio, -1.46; P = 0.02). Distant progression occurred in 44% of the patients at a mean of 8.8 +/- 6.6 months after SRS treatment. Ten cases of leptomeningeal spread occurred around the resection cavities (9.8%). Central nervous system failure was not significantly associated with survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that recursive partitioning analysis and active systemic disease were significantly associated with survival.CONCLUSION: The strategy described provides acceptable local disease control when compared with WBRT following surgery. This approach can delay and even annul WBRT in the majority of selected BM patients, especially recursive partitioning analysis class I patients. SRS should be scheduled as soon as possible after surgery.",Excluded
3667,"Virtual simulation: initial clinical results. We have developed a graphics-based three-dimensional treatment design system that permits the physician to easily understand which anatomy will be treated for any arbitrary beam orientation. Our implementation of this system differs from others in that the software (the Virtual Simulator) simulates the full functionality of a (physical) radiation therapy simulator allowing it to be easily used by physicians. The details of the of our initial clinical experience with virtual simulation are presented in this paper. Virtual simulation was attempted in 71 patients and completed in 65. In 41/71 patients (58%), the beam orientations chosen differed significantly from those traditionally used in our department. Although virtual simulation lead to traditional radiation portals in the remaining patients, in 23/71 (32%) secondary blocking was designed which was different from that which would have been conventionally employed. Thus, overall, virtual simulation lead to treatment changes in 64/71 (90%) of the patients in whom it was attempted. In 78% of evaluable patients the treatment designed with virtual simulation could be implemented on the physical simulator with a precision of +/- 5 mm (+/- 3 mm for brain and head and neck). Thus virtual simulation allowed both accurate planning and execution of treatment plans that would be difficult to achieve with conventional methods.",Excluded
4707,"Comparison of radiosensitizing effects of several PARP inhibitors under clinical investigation. Targeting tumor DNA repair is an attractive strategy in selectively killing tumors while sparing normal tissues. Inhibiting Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in cancers with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has been shown to be a promising approach either as a single agent or in combination therapy with chemotherapeutics or ionizing radiation. To systematically compare the radiosensitizing efficacy of various PARP inhibitors we have evaluated the long-term cytotoxicity of ABT-888, AZD2281, MK4827, and BSI-201 in clonogenic survival assays in combination with ionizing radiation. For these studies we used the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB 231 BR, a subline of MDA-MB-231 selected for its tendency to metastasize to brain (BRCA1+/-) and MX-1 (BRCA1 deletion and BRCA2 mutation). Furthermore, we have evaluated PARP inhibitors under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (21% O2 versus 0.1% O2). In MDA-MB 231 BR cells, at a clinically relevant and achievable concentration for ABT-888 (J Clin Oncol. 2009; 27(16)) and AZD2281(N Engl J Med. 2009; 361(2)), and at 1 uM MK4827 showed radiosensitizing effects under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. BSI-201 at a clinically achievable concentration (ASCO 2010, Abstract 2012) did not exhibit radiosensitizing effects under the same conditions. When MX-1 cells were treated with BSI-201 under hypoxic conditions (0.1% O2) the cytotoxicity of BSI-201 was evident. Taken together, the results show that ABT-888, AZD2281 and MK4827 show promising radiosensitizing effects under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions whereas the cytotoxicity of BSI-201 was observed only under hypoxic conditions in BRCA1/2 mutant carrier MX-1cells.",Excluded

Method(s): Patients with histologic diagnosis of neurocytoma between 1994 and 2011 were identified through an IRB-approved database. Clinical, tumor, and treatment factors were evaluated. Survival times were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Seventeen patients with neurocytoma were treated, age at diagnosis 16.8 - 66.8 years; (median 35.3 years). Thirteen patients were male, all were Caucasian. Most common presenting symptoms: headaches (n=12) and gait disturbance (n=3). Sixteen patients had intraventricular lesions. All patients underwent surgery (gross total resection, GTR: 5, subtotal resection, STR: 10). Three patients (2 with STR and 1 with a biopsy) underwent adjuvant radiation; 2 with fractionated RT and one with stereotactic radiosurgery. Median event free survival (EFS) was 6.3 years and the projected 10 year EFS was 23%. Overall survival (OS) was 92%. The degree of resection did not correlate with EFS. After median follow-up of 8.4 years, 5 patients are without evidence of disease, 4 of which had developed recurrent disease and subsequently underwent GTR.

The use of an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) with focused ultrasound sonication has the potential to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) noninvasively and reversibly at target locations. This study investigated the effects of UCA dose and ultrasound pressure on BBB disruption. Sonications were applied at 1 MHz with a burst length of 10 ms, a 1% duty cycle and a repetition frequency of 1 Hz. The duration of the sonication was 30 s. In in vivo experiments, 16 male Wistar rats were sonicated in the presence of UCA at four doses (0, 30, 60 and 90 muL/kg). BBB integrity was evaluated by injecting Evans blue (EB) into the femoral vein of anesthetized rats. The relationship between UCA dose and the region of EB extravasation was evaluated at ultrasound pressures of 0.9 and 1.2 MPa. The BBB disruption, as quantified by the amount of EB extravasation, was significantly greater in rats injected with UCA at a dose of 60 or 90 muL/kg than at a dose of 0 or 30 muL/kg. The amount of EB extravasation increased monotonically with the quantity of UCA injected into the femoral vein before sonication. Furthermore, the BBB disruption could be enhanced in the focal region relative to the surrounding region with a higher dose of UCA (60 or 90 muL/kg). This study demonstrates that BBB disruption can be both increased and localized to the focal region by injecting an appropriate quantity of UCA before performing focused ultrasound sonications.

Objectives: Radioembolization using Yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres is becoming a more widely utilized treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In recent years, it was found that a Y-90 PET scan can be acquired to determine the distribution of microspheres after their administration. While the obvious advantage of PET is better resolution than Bremsstrahlung imaging, the other great advantage of quantitative assessment is just beginning to be exploited. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 57 patients with HCC, which included 101 distinct tumors, were analyzed after Y-90 microsphere treatment in order to evaluate the dose of radiation delivered to liver tumors as well as to normal liver tissue. Using Y-90 PET/CT and triphasic liver CT scans in conjunction with commercially available imaging software, we were able to contour tumor and normal liver regions treated by Y-90 radioembolization and determine the specific activities (Bq/mL) for treated tumor and normal liver tissue. An absorbed dose factor, taking into account isotope branching ratios and decay was calculated through a phantom experiment. This factor was used to convert the specific activities (Bq/mL) of normal and malignant liver tissue to an absorbed dose (Gy). Result(s): The analysis suggests that the mean dose received among the 101 studied tumors was 166.45 Gy with a mode of 90-120 Gy and a treatment dose range of 0-570 Gy. Normal liver tissue in the 57 cases evaluated received a mean dose of 66.25 Gy with a mode of 60-70 Gy and a range of 10-120 Gy. Conclusion(s): This data demonstrates that the Y-90 dose to liver tumors after radioembolization is fairly similar to the brachytherapy dose used to treat other cancers. This also shows that the normal liver tissue may receive a dose which is nontrivial and have some real biological effects for the patient. This study is among the first to systematically showa method for quantitative dose assessment using Y-90 PET.

3827,"Wwox-Brca1 interaction: role in DNA repair pathway choice. In this study, loss of expression of the fragile site-encoded Wwox protein was found to contribute to radiation and cisplatin resistance of cells, responses that could be associated with cancer recurrence and poor outcome. WWOX gene deletions occur in a variety of human cancer types, and reduced Wwox protein expression can be detected early during cancer development. We found that Wwox loss is followed by mild chromosome instability in genomes of mouse embryo fibroblast cells from Wwox-knockout mice. Human and mouse cells deficient for Wwox also exhibit significantly enhanced survival of ionizing radiation and bleomycin treatment, agents that induce double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cancer cells that survive radiation recur more rapidly in a xenograft model of irradiated breast cancer cells; Wwox-deficient cells exhibited significantly shorter tumor latencies vs Wwox-expressing cells. This Wwox effect has important consequences in human disease: in a cohort of cancer patients treated with radiation, Wwox deficiency significantly correlated with shorter overall survival times. In examining mechanisms underlying Wwox-dependent survival differences, we found that Wwox-deficient cells exhibit enhanced homology directed repair (HDR) and decreased non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, suggesting that Wwox contributes to DNA DSB repair pathway choice. Upon silencing of Rad51, a protein critical for HDR, Wwox-deficient cells were resensitized to radiation. We also demonstrated interaction of Wwox with Brca1, a driver of HDR, and show via immunofluorescent detection of repair proteins at ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage foci that Wwox expression suppresses DSB repair at the end-resection step of HDR. We propose a genome caretaker function for WWOX, in which Brca1-Wwox interaction supports NHEJ as the dominant DSB repair pathway in Wwox-sufficient cells. Taken together, the experimental results suggest that reduced Wwox expression, a common occurrence in cancers, dysregulates DSB repair, enhancing efficiency of likely mutagenic repair, and enabling radiation and cisplatin treatment resistance.",Excluded

However, observation periods were not long enough to allow confirmation of the long-term safety of SRS alone in patients with 5 to 10 BMs.METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was a prospective observational study of Gamma Knife SRS-treated patients with 1 to 10 newly diagnosed BMs enrolled at 23 facilities between March 1, 2009, and February 15, 2012.RESULTS: The 1194 eligible patients were categorized into the following groups: group A, 1 tumor (n=455); group B, 2 to 4 tumors (n=531); and group C, 5 to 10 tumors (n=208). Cumulative rates of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score maintenance (MMSE score decrease <3 from baseline) determined with a competing risk analysis of groups A, B, and C were 93%, 91%, and 92%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 91%, 89%, and 91%, respectively, at the 24th month; 89%, 88%, and 89%, respectively, at the 36th month; and 87%, 86%, and 89%, respectively, at the 48th month (hazard ratio [HR] of group A vs group B, 0.719; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.437-1.172; P=.18; HR of group B vs group C, 1.280; 95% CI, 0.696-2.508; P=.43). During observations ranging from 0.3 to 67.5 months (median, 12.0 months; interquartile range, 5.8-26.5 months), as of December 2014, 145 patients (12.1%) had SRS-induced complications.

Method(s): We propose a cross-modality attention pyramid network (CMAPN) to generate diagnostic quality PET images from low-count PET images with the help of CT from PET/CT scans. Twenty subjects with whole-body PET/CT were used to estimate synthetic diagnostic PET images from a low-count training set using 1/8th of the normal scanning time (19 vs. 162 seconds/bed). CMAPN learns to translate a low-count PET image into a synthetic full-count PET image resembling the one from a high-quality diagnostic standard clinical protocol. At the training stage, independent 3D patch-based deep features were extracted from low-count PET and CT images using two separate PET synthesis sub-networks. The two sub-networks share the same pyramid network architecture. A low-count PET-only synthesis loss, and a CT-only synthesis loss were calculated between the outputs of the two sub-networks. The two losses would allow independent and relevant features to be extracted from low-count PET and CT images for the prediction of full-count PET images. The cross-modal deep features from the two subnetworks were subsequently combined to estimate a final full-count PET image. Feature maps of corresponding pyramid levels were first concatenated and then highlighted via attention gates. The network was trained by minimizing a combination of losses, including a low-count PET-only synthesis loss, a CT-only synthesis loss and a final synthesis loss. At the testing stage, paired low-count PET and CT image patches were first extracted from the original images. These image patch pairs were then inputted into the trained CMAPN to obtain the synthetic full-count PET patches. Finally, the synthetic full-count PET image patches were fused to predict the final whole-body full-count PET images. These synthetic PET images were then compared to the original diagnostic PET images for evaluation. The proposed method was tested using a leaveone-out cross-validation method. Mean error (ME), normalized mean square error (NMSE), normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) were used to quantify the differences between the synthetic and the original diagnostic PET images. Result(s): The average ME, NMSE, NCC and PSNR in the whole body were 0.20+/-1.01% and 0.67+/-0.28%, 0.994+/-0.004% and 46.2+/-2.8dB for all patients. There were no significant differences between the synthetic and the original diagnostic PET images. In a volume of interest, such as the brain, lung, heart, kidneys, and liver, the overall ME was less than 2.5% and the NMSE was less than 1.5% for all patients. Lesion-based ME and NMSE were less than 5% for all patients. Conclusion(s): We have developed a novel CT-aided estimation method for synthetic full-count PET images using CMAPN. The proposed method could generate diagnostic quality PET datasets from ultra-short (1/8th count, 19 seconds/bed) PET scans. The organ boundary definition of the generated PET has improved due to the use of CT images in CMAPN. The proposed method has great potential to improve the quality of low-count PET scans for future implementation of low dose or fast scan PET imaging in the clinic.",Excluded
4420,"Lacrimal gland dosimetry for the brain imaging agent technetium-99m-HMPAO. We calculated lacrimal gland dosimetry for the brain imaging agent 99mTc-HMPAO. One hundred thirty-eight patients were studied using a dedicated brain imaging device. Only 11% of the patients showed lacrimal gland uptake. For a 740-MBq (20 mCi) injected dose of 99mTc-HMPAO, the radiation exposure to the lacrimal glands is 10.2 mGy (1.02 rad), or 0.0138 mGy/MBq (0.051 rad/mCi). These values are five times lower than the ones reported by the manufacturer of HMPAO. As the dosimetry calculation is only for subjects showing 99mTc-HMPAO uptake in the lacrimal gland, the average radiation dose to all subjects is considerably lower, 1/10 of the estimated value.",Excluded
4474,"Low-dose total-body carbon-ion irradiations induce early transcriptional alteration without late Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. The cause and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown. Studies on possible radiation-induced AD-like pathogenesis and behavioral consequences are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) from various sources. It was reported that total-body irradiations (TBI) at 10 cGy of low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to mice triggered acute transcriptional alterations in genes associated with cognitive dysfunctions. However, it was unknown whether low doses of IR could induce AD-like changes late after exposure. We reported previously that 10 cGy X-rays induced early transcriptional response of several AD-related genes in hippocampi without late AD-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. Here, further studies on two low doses (5 or 10 cGy) of high LET carbonion irradiations are reported. On expression of 84 AD-related genes in hippocampi, at 4 hr after TBI, 5 cGy induced a significant upregulation of three genes (Abca1, Casp3, and Chat) and 10 cGy led to a marked upregulation of one gene (Chat) and a downregulation of three genes (Apoe, Ctsd, and Il1alpha), and, at 1 year after TBI, one gene (Il1alpha) was significantly downregulated in 10 cGy-irradiated animals. Changes in spatial learning ability and memory and induction of AD-like pathogenesis were not detected by in vivo brain imaging for amyloid-beta peptide accumulation and by immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta protein, tau, and phosphorylated tau protein. These findings indicate that low doses of carbon-ion irradiations did not cause behavioral impairment or AD-like pathological change in mice.",Included

PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential of photodynamic therapy (PDT) using benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) for occlusion of subretinal neovascular membranes, the authors studied efficiency and collateral damage of PDT-induced photothrombosis in the rabbit choriocapillary layer.METHOD: Benzoporphyrin derivative, a new photosensitizer, currently in clinical trials for tumor therapy, was used. Low-density lipoprotein served as a carrier to enhance selective targeting of vascular endothelial cells.RESULTS: Complete choriocapillary occlusion was achieved at a BPD dose of 2 mg/kg and a radiant exposure as low as 10 J/cm2. When PDT was performed 3 hours after BPD application, damage to the neural retina was minimal. Only inner photoreceptor segments showed mitochondrial swelling probably secondary to choroidal ischemia. Bruch's membrane remained intact. Retinal pigment epithelium was invariably damaged as seen with other photosensitizers.CONCLUSION: Compared with photocoagulation BPD-PDT allows endothelial-bound intraluminal photothrombosis, sparing important structures such as neural retina and Bruch's membrane. It may thus provide a more selective treatment of juxtafoveal and subfoveal neovascular membranes.",Excluded
3983,"Phase i trial of genetically modified hematopoetic progenitor cells facilitating bone marrow chemoprotection and enabling TMZ/o6bg dose escalation resulting in improved survival. INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor with a median survival of 15 months despite surgery and aggressive radio-chemotherapy. The most important mechanism of TMZ resistance is the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene which repairs temozolamide-induced DNA methylation. The MGMT inhibitor O6-benzylguanine (BG) has demonstrated efficacy in depleting MGMT and maximizing tumor response in early phase clinical trials. However, because MGMT expression is also low in hematopoietic cells, this has resulted in unacceptable bone marrow toxicity, and this approach has been abandoned. We hypothesized that chemoprotection of hematopoieticprogenitor cells (HPC) with an MGMT mutant (MGMT-P140K) characterized by normal methyltransferase activity coupled with low affinity for BG, would maximize anti-tumor response while enabling patients to tolerate TMZ & BG dose escalation with minimal toxicity. We thus performed a phase I trial to test this hypothesis. METHOD(S): We treated 7 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed GBM with standard surgery and radiation, followed by transplantation with autologous CD34+hematopoetic progenitor cells engineered to express MGMT-P140K using a lentiviral vector in three arms. To assess chemo-protection, patients' blood counts and transgene marking were monitored during the treatment as was tumor growth and survival. RESULT(S): The viral transduction rates were 2.5-75% and were clearly improved in the third arm with intra-patient dose escalation. P140K-MGMT gene markings in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells increased 3-26- fold with only mild-moderate (Grade 2-3) mylosuppression consistent with chemo-selection and chemo-protection as hypothesized. Survival ranged from 20-36 months which exceeded their RPA predicted survival by 1.9- 3.2 fold suggesting clinical benefit (mean 2.0). Viral insertion site analysis failed to demonstrate evidence of clonal dominance. CONCLUSION(S): These preliminary result demonstrates that this chemoprotection strategy is tolerable, safe, and facilitates TMZ & BG dose escalation resulting in increased survival in a small cohort of selected patients.

3939,"Skeletal muscle metastasis presenting as an initial manifestation of lung cancer. INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide, presents as a metastatic disease in majority of the cases. The most frequent sites of distant metastases are liver, adrenal glands, bones, and brain. Skeletal muscle metastasis as a mode of presentation of lung cancer is a rare phenomenon which is often discovered at autopsy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old male, with forty pack years history of smoking, presented with a painful right, distal thigh swelling for two months and unintentional weight loss of twenty pounds. Examination of right distal thigh revealed a tender, hard, non fluctuant mass, with surrounding erythema. Complete blood count, basic metabolic and hepatic function panel were unremarkable. Chest x ray showed large mass in right lower lobe with a smaller nodule in the right upper lobe which was confirmed by computed tomography ( CT) of the chest. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right lower extremity showed 5.5 x 4.0 x 6.2 cm soft tissue mass in lateral aspect of the distal thigh adjacent to femur. The patient underwent CT guided biopsies of the right lower lobe lung mass and the right thigh mass. Pathology of the lung mass revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (immunostaining positive for cytokeratin and thyroid transcription factor-1) and that of the right thigh mass revealed poorly differentiated malignant tumor most consistent with metastatic non small cell carcinoma (immunostaining positive for cytokeratin). Positron-emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) demonstrated hypermetabolic right lower lobe lung mass and right upper lobe lung nodule, a large right knee soft tissue mass and multiple hypermetabolic soft tissue lesions throughout the muscles of the body along with jugular, external iliac and inguinal hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies. The patient was started on palliative radiation to the right distal thigh. Chemotherapy was not administered due to rapidly deteriorating clinical status. The patient died of septic shock within 4 weeks of diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Skeletal muscle is an exceptionally rare site of metastasis of lung cancer(1). The local pH and the contractile property of skeletal muscle do not favor metastasis. Delay in the diagnosis may occur due to its clinical and radiological resemblance to diseases like abscess and soft tissue sarcoma. Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy of the muscle mass. Treatment is palliative, and majority of the patients die within 1 year of diagnosis (2,3) CONCLUSION(S): Lung cancer with skeletal muscle metastasis should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with intramuscular mass.",Excluded
3969,"Pericardial effusion and cardiac hypokinesis associated with longstanding, multi-organ system sarcoidosis. Introduction: Sarcoidosis is a multi-organ system granulomatous disorder. Pericardial effusions associated with sarcoidosis are uncommon (19% of cases.) Case Report: A 54-year-old lady was diagnosed with sarcoidosis as a result of a breast biopsy in 2014 that revealed non-caseating granulomas. Since then, the patient has had chronic persistent dyspnea. Also, she has had involvement of cardiac muscle, her neurological system (unable to raise the left arm), spleen, lungs (stage 2, bilateral hilar adenopathy with infiltrates), and bony involvement of hands (arthritis and clubbing.) Often, patients with stage 2 sarcoidosis tend to go into remission spontaneously (40-70%.) In our patient's case, none of her multi-organ system manifestations abated. Up until this point, her lifelong condition has never been treated despite her symptoms because she refused corticosteroids. Superimposed on this patient were additional inflammatory diagnoses: Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, treated lyme disease, second degree heart block, spinal meningitis, tick-borne alpha 1,3 galactose allergy. When we met the patient our focus was patient-centered education. We convinced our patient to accept steroid treatment because PET-MRI imaging may now detect scar vs. inflamed, viable tissue in her ventricle with enhanced sensitivity. Discussion(s): Newer-generation PET-MRI scans have ability to differentiate scar vs. inflammatory muscle with enhanced sensitivity. This improves clinical decision-making. Only 40-50% patients with cardiac sarcoidosis are diagnosed during their lifetime. To avert missed diagnoses, the advent of improved PET-MRI allows us to detect and treat cardiac sarcoidosis. It is incumbent to treat, because, if left untreated, the risk of sudden death from cardiac sarcoidosis is as high as 85%. Recent developments in PET technology reduce radiation dose. In our patient's situation, her decision to finally initiate therapy at age 54 was based on a patient-centered, empathic, compassionate explanation of the multi-system organ nature of her disease and the advantageous properties of PET-MRI to detect a treatable cause of dyspnea.",Excluded
4817,"Combined effect of irradiation and B-vitamins deficiency on the voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. The accidents in atomic electric stations took place in many countries. The most severe catastrophe was happened in 1986 in Ukraine. The population in Chernobyl region is suffering both from the consequences of irradiation and polyvitamine deficiency. Can it be related with the increased alcohol consumption observed in that region? To test this hypotheses we have studied the influence of the thiamine and folate deficiency and low dose irradiation and their combination on the voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. 80 adult male rats waiting 140-180 g. were preliminary tested in the conditions of free choice between 10% ethanol and water (triple, during 2 days). Then they were divided into 4 groups (on 20 animals) equal on the alcohol consumption and preference. 2 weeks later they were treated by hidrochythiamine (vitamin B1 antagonist, 1 mg/kg, s.c.) and metotrexate (folic acid antagonist, 200 mg/kg, s.c.) weekly, three times. 2 days following the every administration the some animals were treated by the gamma-irradiation (Co60, 0.25 gray). The groups were: 1- control (isotonic solution of NaCl); 2- irradiation alone; 3- antivitamins; 4- antivitamins + irradiations. Next day following the last irradiation half of animals from every group were sacrificed and vitamins status in their tissues was studied. Others were tested during 14 days individually in situation of free choice between 10% ethanol solution and water. In groups 2-4 the decreased transketolase activity (marker thiamine-dependent enzyme) and thiamine diphosphate level in blood, liver and brain as well as signs of folic deficiency were found. In groups 3 and 4 the alcohol preference index on the first week of post-irradiation testing period increased on 40.8 and 112.7% (p<0.05); on the second week on 19,1 and 81.4% (P <0.05) accordingly. In conclusion, the combination of low dose irradiation and B-vitamins deficiency increases the alcohol preference and consumption in rats. Those factors may be one of the reason of alcohol addiction also in population of Chernobyl region.",Included

A light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS), a silicon-based surface potential detector, is combined with bioengineered olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) for odorant detection. A LAPS chip is used as a transducer to monitor cell membrane potential changes. In addition, a focused movable laser with a diameter comparable to cell sizes is employed to select the desirable single cell for measurement under a microscope. Bioengineered OSNs are coupled to the LAPS surface and employed as sensing elements, which are prepared by the expression of an olfactory receptor of C. elegans, ODR-10, on the plasma membrane of rat primary OSNs via transient transfection. The responses of bioengineered OSNs to diacetyl, isoamyl acetate, and acetic acid are monitored by extracellular recording using the LAPS chip. Features of the recorded extracellular potential firings are analyzed in frequency and time domains. We have shown that bioengineered OSNs can generate specific response signals upon the stimulation of diacetyl, which is the natural ligand of ODR-10. Moreover, different concentrations of diacetyl can elicit different temporal firing patterns in bioengineered OSNs, which permits the concentration detection of specific odorant molecules in solution.",Excluded
4200,"Microstimulation of V1 delays visually guided saccades: a parametric evaluation of delay fields. Electrical microstimulation of macaque striate cortex (area V1) delays the execution of saccadic eye movements made to a visual target placed in the receptive field of the stimulated neurons. The region of visual space within which saccades are delayed is called a delay field. We examined the effects of changing the parameters of stimulation and target size on the size of a delay field. Rhesus monkeys were required to generate a saccadic eye movement to a punctate and white visual target presented within or outside the receptive field of the neurons under study. On 50% of trials, a train of stimulation consisting of 0.2-ms anode-first pulses was delivered to the neurons before the onset of the visual target. Stimulations were performed in the operculum at 0.9-2.0 mm below the cortical surface. It was found that increases in current (50-100 microA), pulse frequency (100-300 Hz), or train duration (75-300 ms) increased the size of a delay field and increases in target size (0.1 degrees -0.2 degrees of visual angle) decreased the size of a delay field. Delay fields varied in size between 0.1 and 0.6 degrees of visual angle.

4585,"Radiation-induced astrogliosis and blood-brain barrier damage can be abrogated using anti-TNF treatment. PURPOSE: In this article, we investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in the initiation of acute damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain tissue following radiotherapy (RT) for CNS tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy and a closed cranial window technique were used to measure quantitatively BBB permeability to FITC-dextran 4.4-kDa molecules, leukocyte adhesion (Rhodamine-6G) and vessel diameters before and after 20-Gy cranial radiation with and without treatment with anti-TNF. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify astrogliosis post-RT and immunofluorescence was used to visualize protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 post-RT. Recombinant TNF (rTNF) was used to elucidate the role of TNF in leukocyte adhesion and vessel diameter.RESULTS: Mice treated with anti-TNF showed significantly lower permeability and leukocyte adhesion at 24 and 48 h post-RT vs. RT-only animals. We observed a significant decrease in arteriole diameters at 48 h post-RT that was inhibited in TNF-treated animals. We also saw a significant increase in activated astrocytes following RT that was significantly lower in the anti-TNF-treated group. In addition, immunofluorescence showed protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 in the cerebral cortex that was inhibited with anti-TNF treatment. Finally, administration of rTNF induced a decrease in arteriole diameter and a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion in venules and arterioles.CONCLUSIONS: TNF plays a significant role in acute changes in BBB permeability, leukocyte adhesion, arteriole diameter, and astrocyte activation following cranial radiation.

4047,"BOLD fMRI integration into radiosurgery treatment planning of cerebral vascular malformations. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to distinguish areas of the brain responsible for different tasks and functions. It is possible, for example, by using fMRI images, to identify particular regions in the brain which can be considered as ""functional organs at risk"" (fOARs), i.e., regions which would cause significant patient morbidity if compromised. The aim of this study is to propose and validate a method to exploit functional information for the identification of fOARs in CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) radiosurgery treatment planning; in particular, given the high spatial accuracy offered by the CyberKnife system, local nonrigid registration is used to reach accurate image matching. Five patients affected by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and scheduled to undergo radiosurgery were scanned prior to treatment using computed tomography (CT), three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography (3DRA), T2 weighted and blood oxygenation level dependent echo planar imaging MRI. Tasks were chosen on the basis of lesion location by considering those areas which could be potentially close to treatment targets. Functional data were superimposed on 3DRA and CT used for treatment planning. The procedure for the localization of fMRI areas was validated by direct cortical stimulation on 38 AVM and tumor patients undergoing conventional surgery. Treatment plans studied with and without considering fOARs were significantly different, in particular with respect to both maximum dose and dose volume histograms; consideration of the fOARs allowed quality indices of treatment plans to remain almost constant or to improve in four out of five cases compared to plans with no consideration of fOARs. In conclusion, the presented method provides an accurate tool for the integration of functional information into AVM radiosurgery, which might help to minimize undesirable side effects and to make radiosurgery less invasive. © 2007 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded
4151,"The protective effect of dexamethasone against radiation damage induced by interstitial irradiation in normal monkey brain. OBJECTIVE: The protective effect of dexamethasone against radiation damage is unclear. We examined the effect of early treatment of high-dose dexamethasone on iridium-192-induced damage to normal brain tissue.METHODS: Brain damage induced by interstitial irradiation with iridium-192 was evaluated with sequential magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 11 adult monkeys, with or without short-term high-dose dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg of body weight/d) was administered intramuscularly to five irradiated animals every 24 hours, beginning 2 days before and ending 7 days after irradiation. Magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after irradiation.RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 week after irradiation revealed marked edema in five nontreated animals. In dexamethasone-treated animals, the volume of edema was reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 1 week and 1 month after irradiation. The volume of ring enhancement in dexamethasone-treated animals was also reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 3 months after the irradiation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra revealed that N-acetylaspartate and choline peaks were reduced 1 week after irradiation in both groups. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at any time points.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that dexamethasone treatment may have an antiedema effect at an early stage and may modify subsequent development of vascular and inflammatory changes but may have no effect of preventing radiation-induced necrosis and the reduction of N-acetylaspartate after brachytherapy.",Included

3763,"Absorbed doses to kidneys based on one or two SPECT measurements versus three SPECT measurements in 777 patients with neuroendocrine tumours receiving<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE therapy. Aim/Introduction: As in all therapies using ionizing radiation, a patient-specific optimization of the delivered radiation should be performed in therapy with<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. At our centre, the number of treatments is based on the absorbed dose (AD) to the kidneys. For logistical reasons, estimation of absorbed doses should be performed with as few measurements as possible. The aim of the present work was to study how well kidney AD and effective half-life (t<inf>eff</inf>) estimations using methods with one or two measurement points agree with the method we use today that is based on three imaging points. Material(s) and Method(s): 777 patients (333 female and 444 male) with neuroendocrine tumors with high somatostatin receptor expression were included. SPECT/CT over the abdomen were acquired at 24, 96 and 168 h after start of infusion of<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. AD and teff were calculated using single exponential fits to data from 3 measurements (24-96-168) or two measurements (24- 96 and 24-168). In addition, absorbed doses were calculated using a single measurement, assuming t<inf>eff</inf>50 h (96/50h). Bias of AD and teff values relative to those based on the three-point measurement were calculated. To test statistical significance a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test with a P-value of 0.05 for significance was used. Median, Min and Max of the deviations were also calculated. Result(s): Bias versus AD(24-96- 168) was -3%(-20-72) (Median (Min-Max)) for AD(24-96), 3%(-22- 30) for AD(24-168) and -7%(-51-27) for AD(96/50h). The bias for teff in the AD calculations versus AD(24-96-168) was -9% (-53- 63) for AD(24-96) and 0% (-9-4) for AD(24-168). In all tests there was a small but significant difference for the whole group. In about 15% of the patients the bias in t<inf>eff</inf>was more than 20% when ignoring the 168-h scan. In about 5-10% of the patients AD differed more than 20% for all methods that excluded the 168-h measurement. Using a fixed limit of the absorbed dose to the kidneys, this would mean that these patients would be given either too many or too few treatments. Conclusion(s): Although absorbed dose calculations based on only one or two measurement points may serve as a good approximation for the majority of patients, it leads to substantial errors affecting the number of given treatments in about 10% of patients. Since this is a radiation treatment a high precision for all patients is warranted, and three measurements, or at least inclusion of a late 168-h measurement, are recommended.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to develop methods for the production of high levels of (211)At and the radiosynthesis of clinically useful amounts of (211)At-labeled human/mouse chimeric 81C6 antibody.METHODS: (211)At was produced through the (209)Bi(alpha, 2n)(211)At reaction using an internal target system and purified by a dry distillation process. Antibody labeling was accomplished by first synthesizing N-succinimidyl 3-[(211)At]astatobenzoate from the corresponding tri-n-butyl tin precursor and reacting it with the antibody in pH 8.5 borate buffer. Quality control procedures consisted of methanol precipitation, size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and pyrogen and sterility assays, as well as determination of the immunoreactive fraction by a rapid procedure using a recombinant tenascin fragment coupled to magnetic beads.RESULTS: A total of 16 antibody labeling runs were performed. Using beam currents of 50-60 microA alpha-particles and irradiation times of 1.5-4.5 h, the mean (211)At production yield was 27.75 +/- 2.59 MBq/microA.h, and the maximum level of (211)At produced was 6.59 GBq after a 4-h irradiation at 55 microA. The decay-corrected distillation yield was 67% +/- 16%. The yield for the coupling of the (211)At-labeled active ester to the antibody was 76% +/- 8%. The fraction of (211)At activity that eluted with a retention time corresponding to intact IgG on HPLC was 96.0% +/- 2.5%.

3749,"Identification of the S3 foramen during transforaminal sacral neuromodulation lead placement-a novel ""rolling pen"" technique. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is FDA approved for urinary urgency, urinary frequency, urgency urinary incontinence, non-obstructive urinary retention and fecal incontinence. SNM modulates electrical input to the bladder preventing and decreasing over stimulation, thus improving symptoms. The S3 foramen must be localized for lead implantation and the efficacy of implantation depends on the ability to localize S3 reliably and correctly. Localization is accomplished using various strategies, most commonly using a combination of palpation of bony landmarks and fluoroscopy. This paper will serve to introduce a novel ""rolling pen"" technique that eliminates the use of fluoroscopy for S3 identification. This technique is currently used in clinical practice by the two highest volume implanters in Louisiana. METHOD(S): The patients were positioned prone and prepped in the usual manner. Instead of using fluoroscopy or palpation to identify bony landmarks to localize the S3 foramen, we balanced a marking pen longitudinally in the midline of the sacrum. The pen was allowed to roll until horizontal equilibrium was established. The fulcrum of the balanced ""rolling pen"" identified the level of S3. A mark 2 cm proximal and 2 cm lateral to this landmark was made for entry of the finder needle at the level of the skin. We then proceeded with our implantation in the usual manner. The rolling pen technique was used for all patients as our initial strategy to identify the S3 foramen. RESULT(S): 228 implantations were performed between 7/2012 and 10/2014 at our 2 tertiary centers. All cases used the rolling pen technique as our initial S3 foramen identification strategy. Adhering to the ALARA principle, fluoroscopy was limited to confirming and adjusting needle and lead placement in the operating room. All office procedures were performed without fluoroscopy. CONCLUSION(S): We conclude that the novel rolling pen technique can be used as yet another method for S3 localization during transforaminal lead placement during SNM implantation.

Biopsy confirmed cerebral radiation necrosis. The radiation dose was 25 Gray to the periphery of two overlapping 14 mm collimator fields, delivered in a single dose. Treatment with steroids led to improvement in the symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure, but not the focal deficit. Radiation necrosis is a consequence of the large doses required to obliterate AVMs and is a limiting factor in their treatment. It is important for clinicians referring patients for stereotactic radiosurgery to be aware of this complication, and to be able to recognise and treat it.",Excluded
4485,"The sensitivity of light-evoked responses of retinal ganglion cells is decreased in nitric oxide synthase gene knockout mice. We have shown previously that increasing the production of nitric oxide (NO) results in a dampening of visual responses of retinal ganglion cells (G. Y. Wang, L. C. Liets, & L. M. Chalupa, 2003). To gain further insights into the role of NO in retinal function, we made whole-cell patch clamp recordings from ganglion cells of neural type nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene knockout mice. Here we show that in the dark-adapted state, the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cell to light stimulation is decreased in nNOS knockout animals. The lowest light intensities required to evoke optimal responses and the average intensities that evoked half-maximal responses were significantly higher in nNOS knockouts than in normal mice. Retinal histology and other features of light-evoked responses of ganglion cells in nNOS mice appeared to be indistinguishable from those of normal mice. Collectively, these results, in conjunction with our previous work, provide evidence that increasing levels of NO dampen visual responses of ganglion cells, while a lack of nNOS decreases the sensitivity of these neurons to light. Thus, NO levels in the retina are capable of modulating the information that ganglion cells convey to the visual centers of the brain.",Excluded

This study demonstrates that virtually homogenous cultures of mouse cerebral neurons, obtained from 15-day-old embryos, differentiate at least as well as cultures which in addition contain astrocytes. This was indicated by glutamate decarboxylase activity which within 2 weeks rose from a negligible value to twice the level in the adult mouse cerebral cortex, and by a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake rate which quadrupled during the second week in culture and reached higher values than in brain slices. Within the same period, the GABA content increased four to five times to 75 nmol/mg protein, and a potassium-induced increase in [<sup>14</sup>C]GABA efflux became apparent. Although the development was faster than in vivo, optimum differentiation required maintenance of the cultures beyong the age of 1 week. Uptake and release rates for glutamate and glutamine underwent much less developmental alteration. At no time was there any potassium-induced release of radioactivity after exposure to [<sup>14</sup>C]glutamate, and the glutamate uptake was only slightly increased during the period of GABAergic development.

Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor onco-genetics. We aimed to determine whether the RTOGRPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment paradigm, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. METHOD(S): Patients with histologically-proven high-grade gliomas treated with IMRT between 2004-2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pre-treatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. RESULT(S): We identified 878 patients with a median overall survival of 14.2 months (95% CI: 13.1-15.3). Our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the RTOG RPA survival classes except class II. Our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (p2 = 584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, MGMT methylation, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide, and resection. Our second RPA of our genetic subset (291 patients) generated 5 significantly different survival classes (p2 = 166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, IDH1 mutation, MGMT methylation, neurologic functional classification, IMRT hospitalization, temozolomide, and KPS. CONCLUSION(S): This series represents a large RPA analyzing clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These classifications need to be validated by a prospective dataset and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine if they provide improved prognostic power.",Excluded

This study reports on patients treated with radiotherapy as part of the treatment for laryngeal cancer in the Department of Radiation Oncology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, P.R. China. Sixty-two males and nine females were treated with radiotherapy between 2006 and 3012. The carotid diameter was determined by measuring carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in the common, external and internal carotid artery. Microinflammatory conditions were assessed by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Other studied risk factors included age, treatment modalities, radiation dose and energy, the height of the radiation field, and follow-up time. Carotid stenosis was detected in all of the 71 patients. It was mainly clinically unsuspected; 19 patients had sustained a vascular event (14 TIA, 5 CVI) at a median of 3.11 years (range 2.3-5.6 years) following RT. In four of five CVI patients, CVI occurred on the side of the irradiation. Eleven patients who suffered vascular incident had severe stenosis of the carotid artery and 6 had moderate (31-49% of the lumen).

4082,"Reducing the dosimetric impact of positional errors in field junctions for craniospinal irradiation using VMAT. AIM: To improve treatment plan robustness with respect to small shifts in patient position during the VMAT treatment by ensuring a linear ramp-like dose profile in treatment field overlap regions.BACKGROUND: Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is considered technically challenging because the target size exceeds the maximal field size, which necessitates using abutted or overlapping treatment fields. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is increasingly being examined for CSI, as it offers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance while also offering a possibility to create field junctions which are more robust towards small shifts in patient position during the treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VMAT treatment plan with three isocenters was made for a test case patient. Three groups of overlapping arc field pairs were used; one for the cranial and two for the spinal part. In order to assure a ramp-like dose profile in the field overlap region, the upper spinal part was optimised first, with dose prescription explicitly enforcing a ramp-like dose profile. The cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards, taking into account the dose contribution of the upper spinal fields.RESULTS: Using simple geometrical reasoning, we demonstrated that hot- and cold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative to the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions: (a) widening the field overlap region, and (b) reducing the field gradient across the overlap region. The function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear ramp. We present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose profile of the two contributing fields, and minimises dosimetric dependence on minor positional errors in patient set-up.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation exposure of patients treated with Onyx to the radation exposure of those treated with nBCA on a per embolization basis. Method(s): The study group consisted of 34 patients that were embolized at the Leiden University Medical Center. Patients were assigned to two groups, Group I consisting of patients that had received Onyx embolization and Group II consisting of patients that had received nBCA embolization. The patient groups were matched for age, AVM characteristics and the number of embolizations. Cohorts were compared by PA radiation dose and lateral radiation dose. Result(s): A total of 44 embolizations were performed on 34 patients (Onyx, 17 patients and 22 embolizations; nBCA, 17 patients and 22 embolizations).

PURPOSE: To investigate homology and stress response of p53 (a 53 kDa tumor suppressor protein) orthologue in Sf9 Lepidopteran insect cell line that exhibits very high radioresistance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, degenerate RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay, flow cytometry and immuno-fluorescence microscopy were used for characterizing structural and functional features of Sfp53 (Spodoptera frugiperda p53) in gamma-irradiated or etoposide-treated Sf9 insect and BMG-1 (brain malignant glioma) human cells. Cells were pre-treated with caffeine for inhibiting ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein/ATM and Rad-3-related protein) activation, wherever required.RESULTS: A 47-49 kDa protein band was observed with antibodies against three different epitopes, demonstrating conservation of respective domains in Sfp53. Immunoprecipitation also yielded similar-sized protein. Degenerate RT-PCR resulted in product of same size in both cell lines. Similar gel mobility shift of p53-binding oligonucleotide with BMG-1 and Sf9 cell lysates indicated analogous transcriptional activity of Sfp53. Constitutive Sfp53 level was higher than hp53 (human p53) and showed primarily cytoplasmic localization. Radiation-induced accumulation was considerably less in Sf9 even as an analogous ATM/ATR-dependent nuclear translocation was observed following gamma-irradiation and etoposide.CONCLUSIONS: A smaller-sized Sfp53 orthologue shows highly conserved native structure with DNA-binding, N-terminus and C-terminus domains, and has analogous p53 transcriptional activity.

4811,"Auditory efferent feedback system deficits precede age-related hearing loss: contralateral suppression of otoacoustic emissions in mice. The C57BL/6J mouse has been a useful model of presbycusis, as it displays an accelerated age-related peripheral hearing loss. The medial olivocochlear efferent feedback (MOC) system plays a role in suppressing cochlear outer hair cell (OHC) responses, particularly for background noise. Neurons of the MOC system are located in the superior olivary complex, particularly in the dorsomedial periolivary nucleus (DMPO) and in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB). We previously discovered that the function of the MOC system declines with age prior to OHC degeneration, as measured by contralateral suppression (CS) of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in humans and CBA mice. The present study aimed to determine the time course of age changes in MOC function in C57s. DPOAE amplitudes and CS of DPOAEs were collected for C57s from 6 to 40 weeks of age. MOC responses were observed at 6 weeks but were gone at middle (15-30 kHz) and high (30-45 kHz) frequencies by 8 weeks. Quantitative stereological analyses of Nissl sections revealed smaller neurons in the DMPO and VNTB of young adult C57s compared with CBAs. These findings suggest that reduced neuron size may underlie part of the noteworthy rapid decline of the C57 efferent system. In conclusion, the C57 mouse has MOC function at 6 weeks, but it declines quickly, preceding the progression of peripheral age-related sensitivity deficits and hearing loss in this mouse strain.",Excluded
4712,"Cell-type specific modulation of intrinsic firing properties and subthreshold membrane oscillations by the M(Kv7)-current in neurons of the entorhinal cortex. The M-current (current through Kv7 channels) is a low-threshold noninactivating potassium current that is suppressed by muscarinic agonists. Recent studies have shown its role in spike burst generation and intrinsic subthreshold theta resonance, both of which are important for memory function. However, little is known about its role in principal cells of the entorhinal cortex (EC). In this study, using whole cell patch recording techniques in a rat EC slice preparation, we have examined the effects of the M-current blockers linopirdine and XE991 on the membrane dynamics of principal cells in the EC. When the M-current was blocked, layer II nonstellate cells (non-SCs) and layer III cells switched from tonic discharge to intermittent firing mode, during which layer II non-SCs showed high-frequency short-duration spike bursts due to increased fast spike afterdepolarization (ADP). When three spikes were elicited at 50 Hz, these two types of cells reacted with a slow ADP that drove delayed firing. In contrast, layer II stellate cells (SCs) and layer V cells never displayed intermittent firing, bursting behavior, or delayed firing. Under the M-current block, intrinsic excitability increased significantly in layer III and layer V cells but not in layer II SCs and non-SCs. The M-current block also had contrasting effects on the subthreshold excitability, greatly suppressing the subthreshold membrane potential oscillations in layer V cells but not in layer II SCs. Modulation of the M-current thus shifts the firing behavior, intrinsic excitability, and subthreshold membrane potential oscillations of EC principal cells in a cell-type-dependent manner.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: This study represents the first step toward testing the hypothesis that hypergravity can be used as a unique resistance training modality for maintaining the health and function of skeletal muscle in microgravity. The primary objectives of this study were to use a human-powered short-arm centrifuge for the following: 1) to determine whether subjects could perform squats under hypergravity conditions without developing motion sickness or illusory motion; 2) to measure foot forces while performing squats under hypergravity conditions; and 3) to determine the mechanical power required to produce 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 Gz (head to foot) at the feet.METHODS: Subjects (22 males and 19 females) performed 10 squats each at 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 Gz on a human-powered short-arm centrifuge, the space cycle. Foot forces during each squat were monitored using insole force sensors, and normalized to foot forces measured at 1 Gz (relative foot forces).RESULTS: Illusory motion was minimized using a visual focal point, and did not affect the ability of subjects to perform squats. The mean standing relative foot forces at 3.0 Gz were 2.3 and 2.4 for the male and female subjects, respectively. The work rate required to power the space cycle was a linear function of Gz, and is well within the aerobic scope of untrained individuals.DISCUSSION: The findings of this study demonstrate that hypergravity can be used as an effective modality for loading skeletal muscle and that subjects can perform squat resistance exercise without developing motion sickness or illusory motion.",Excluded

Damage to the zebrafish retina induces Muller glia to act as stem cells, generating retinal progenitors for regeneration. In contrast, injury in the mammalian retina results in Muller glial reactive gliosis, a characteristic gliotic response that is normally detrimental to vision. Understanding the signaling pathways that determine how Muller glia respond to injury is a critical step toward promoting regeneration in the mammalian retina. Here we report that zebrafish Muller glia exhibit signs of reactive gliosis even under normal regenerative conditions and that cell cycle inhibition increases this response. Persistently reactive Muller glia increase their neuroprotective functions, temporarily saving photoreceptors from a cytotoxic light lesion. However, the absence of a sustained proliferation response results in a significant inhibition of retinal regeneration. Interestingly, when cell cycle inhibition is released, a partial recovery of regeneration is observed.

3880,"Radiation dose during coronary angiography: Correlation to body mass index. Introduction: Coronary angiography (CAG) is a commonly performed procedure in cardiology, resulting in patients being exposed to radiation. Patients with high body mass index (BMI) are at increased risk of coronary artery disease. Catheter laboratory intensifiers use automatic exposure control (AEC) which adjusts radiation dose aiming to provide optimal quality images. Factors shown to be responsible for dose variability are complexity of the procedure, operator experience, their level of training in radiation protection, type and performance of x-ray equipment. The objective of present study was to evaluate if radiation dose received by patients correlated with BMI. Method(s): Retrospective data for 3678 CAG performed from Sep-07 to Mar-10 from a single centre, were analysed. Radiation dose was calculated as Dose Area Product (DAP) in mGym . Result(s): Mean radiation dose during the procedure was 4339 +/- 286 mGym . Mean BMI, contrast volume used and screening time were 29.22 +/- 0.08 kg/m2, 125 +/- 10.0 ml and 5.2 +/- 0.1 minutes respectively. BMI was positively correlated with increasing radiation dose during CAG (graph-1 &2). Patients with increased BMI did not require prolonged procedure or increased contrast volume. There was no significant inter-operator variability. Even Ten degree increase in angulation (oblique, cranial or caudal) increased radiation dose significantly. Conclusion(s): Patients with increased BMI receive a significantly higher radiation dose during CAG, affecting not only the patient, but every one present in the catheter laboratory. This has to be recognized by the operator when undertaking procedures in patients with a high BMI.",Excluded

Before 1980, 16 patients were treated with postoperative radiation without definite chemotherapy, and only one has survived more than 5 years. Local recurrence was the most common cause of failure. In 1981, the authors started a protocol in which four to six courses of systemic chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (VEPA) was given after whole brain radiation (30-40 Gy) with a local boost up to 50 to 60 Gy. Eight patients completed this protocol, and all of them are alive at 16 to 100 months after diagnosis, with three patients surviving more than 5 years. Only one patient developed recurrence. On the other hand, six patients who did not complete or receive chemotherapy after 1981 are dead or alive with recurrence.

Results were analyzed using paired t-tests.RESULTS: At 33 cm, 100% brightness, and 0% NS, the screen protector decreased intensity by 43.9%, 32.3%, and 34.9% for the iPhone 8, iPhone X, and iPad, respectively. At 33 cm and 100% brightness, increasing NS mode from 0% to 100% decreased intensity by 81.2%, 84.2%, and 86.5%. At 33 cm without NS, decreasing the brightness from 100% to 0% decreased intensity by 99.5%, 99.8%, and 97.8%.CONCLUSIONS: The screen protector decreased the intensity at 450 nm for every setting other than those at 0% brightness. Decreasing brightness and applying NS mode were more effective in reducing blue light. More research is needed to determine the benefits of decreasing blue light exposure from electronic devices.",Excluded

PURPOSE: We submit an alternative treatment for unreleasable trismus to increase the interincisal distance and allow adequate oral nutrition and masticatory function.PATIENT AND METHODS: The patient presented with severe trismus after receiving postoperation radiotherapy for oral carcinoma. We undertook radical release of the left-sided trismus, and covered the resultant soft tissue defect with an anterolateral thigh free flap, but the patient was only able to open his mouth an interincisal distance of 8 mm. The right mandible was accessed and the functionless residual teeth were extracted. Marginal mandibulectomy of the native mandible was performed.RESULTS: Dental implants (POI, Kyocera, Japan) were inserted into the leveled right mandible. A bridge dental prosthesis was inserted and resulted in a final functional interincisal distance of 19 mm.CONCLUSION: We offer that leveling the native mandible to match the reconstructed side is a simple procedure that can be reasonably used as an alternative measure in a selected group of patients.",Excluded
3746,"A Protocol for Transcranial Photobiomodulation Therapy in Mice. Transcranial photobiomodulation is a potential innovative noninvasive therapeutic approach for improving brain bioenergetics, brain function in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and memory enhancement in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. We describe a laboratory protocol for transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in mice. Aged BALB/c mice (18 months old) are treated with a 660 nm laser transcranially, once daily for 2 weeks. Laser transmittance data shows that approximately 1% of the incident red light on the scalp reaches a 1 mm depth from the cortical surface, penetrating the dorsal hippocampus. Treatment outcomes are assessed by two methods: a Barnes maze test, which is a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory task evaluation, and measuring hippocampal ATP levels, which is used as a bioenergetics index. The results from the Barnes task show an enhancement of the spatial memory in laser-treated aged mice when compared with age-matched controls. Biochemical analysis after laser treatment indicates increased hippocampal ATP levels. We postulate that the enhancement of memory performance is potentially due to an improvement in hippocampal energy metabolism induced by the red laser treatment. The observations in mice could be extended to other animal models since this protocol could potentially be adapted to other species frequently used in translational neuroscience, such as rabbit, cat, dog, or monkey. Transcranial photobiomodulation is a safe and cost-effective modality which may be a promising therapeutic approach in age-related cognitive impairment.",Excluded
4226,"Hydrocephalus in radiation leukoencephalopathy: results of ventriculoperitoneal shunting. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical benefit of ventriculoperitoneal shunting in patients suffering from radiotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy.DESIGN: Retrospective review of a single institutional experience.PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients with the postradiotherapy syndrome received ventriculoperitoneal shunts. All had a history of cranial irradiation, progressive ventriculomegaly visible on neuroimaging scans, and neurologic decline; other causes of hydrocephalus were excluded. All 31 patients had cognitive deficits: 30 had gait disturbance and 24 were incontinent.RESULTS: Twenty-four (80%) of 30 assessable patients achieved symptomatic improvement an average of 1.6 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Incontinence and gait problems were more likely to improve than cognition. Sixteen (53%) of 30 patients achieved a good overall functional outcome, and incontinence was the only feature significantly associated with good outcome (P=.04). Neither cerebrospinal fluid-opening pressure nor tap tests predicted improvement from ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Median duration of improvement was 6 months, and median survival after receiving the shunt was 14.5 months. Shunt-related complications occurred in 10 (33%) of 30 patients, with 1 fatal outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Our results from ventriculoperitoneal shunting in selected patients with radiation-induced hydrocephalus suggest potential benefit. Improvement is incomplete and temporary, but can improve quality of life. Reliable predictors of successful shunt outcome were not identified.",Excluded
4580,"Sacral nerve stimulator use in a patient with low anterior resection syndrome. Introduction: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer are treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection. Advanced surgical techniques such as mesorectal excision have enabled sphincter sparing surgery to be accomplished for patients with distal cancers. Although these procedures are being done more frequently, they remain fraught with both immediate perioperative and long term complications. Fecal Incontinence (FI) is a significant long term postoperative complication which can result following such surgical intervention. While reports show improvement over a 1-2 year period, a significant number of patients continue to experience FI and the so called Low Anterior Syndrome (LAS). Sacral nerve neuromodulation has been traditionally used for treatment of urinary incontinence with the use of Sacral Nerve Stimulator (SNS) implantation and is now being utilized to treat FI. We report the initial successful use of SNS to treat fecal incontinence secondary to radiation and postoperative changes following treatment for rectal cancer. A 70 year old Asian female was diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer and underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by low anterior resection with diverting ileostomy in 2011. Her ostomy was reversed in August 2012 and she developed fecal incontinence. Non-operative measures were taken in attempt to improve her incontinence without success including fiber supplementation and pelvic floor therapy. Method(s): Prior to SNS implantation the patient was given a Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS). Patients rate daily incontinence episodes on a 4 point scale in 5 categories including incontinence to solids, liquids, gas, frequency of protective undergarment pads and need to modify lifestyle. A score of 0 in each category is equivalent to never events and a score of 4 is equal to always with 20 being a maximum score. The patient then underwent placement of the SNS probes into the S3 foramen. This was followed by a 1 week test period in which the patient had the probes connected to an external modulator. Following the test phase she then was reassessed with the CCFIS. Result(s): The patients initial CCFIS was the maximum score of 20. Following insertion of the probe at 1 week the patient reported an improvement in her CCFIS to 11. She maintained incontinence to solids usually (score of 3), liquid never (0), gas always (4), use of pads always (4), lifestyle modification never (0). Conclusion(s): Sacral Nerve Stimulator insertion is potentially an effective treatment for fecal incontinence for patients that have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiation and resection for rectal cancer. Further study is warranted on larger sample sizes to ensure consistency of results and long term outcomes should be measured.",Excluded

4007,"Inter-individual variations in electric fields induced in the brain by exposure to uniform magnetic fields at 50 Hz. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard establish safety limits for human exposure to electromagnetic fields. At low frequencies, only a limited number of computational body models or simplified geometrical shapes are used to relate the internal induced electric fields and the external magnetic fields. As a consequence, both standard/guidelines derive the exposure reference levels for the external magnetic field without considering the variability between individuals. Here we provide quantitative data on the variation of the maximum electric field strengths induced in the brain of 118 individuals when exposed to uniform magnetic fields at 50 Hz. We found that individual characteristics, such as age and skull volume, as well as incident magnetic field direction, have a systematic effect on the peak electric field values. Older individuals show higher induced electric field strengths, possibly due to age-related anatomical changes in brain. Peak electric field strengths are found to increase for larger skull volumes, as well as for incident magnetic fields directed along the lateral direction. Moreover, the maximum electric fields provided by the anatomical models used by ICNIRP for deriving exposure limits are considerably higher than those obtained here. On the contrary, the IEEE elliptical exposure model produces a weaker peak electric field strength. Our findings are useful for the revision and harmonization of the current exposure standard and guidelines. The present investigation reduces the dosimetric uncertainty of the induced electric field among different anatomical induction models. The obtained results can be used as a basis for the selection of appropriate reduction factors when deriving exposure reference levels for human protection to low-frequency electromagnetic exposure.",Excluded

Background and purpose: To evaluate the impact of adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in adult WHO grade II-III intracranial ependymoma (IEPN). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 172 pathologically confirmed adult grade II-III IEPN patients from 12 institutions were eligible. Of them, 106 (61.6%) and 66 (38.4%) patients were grade II and III, respectively. For grade II and III IEPNs, 51 (48.1%) and 59 (89.4%) patients received PORT, respectively. The median dose to the primary tumor bed was 54.0 Gy and 59.4 Gy for grade II and III patients, respectively. The prognostic impact of sex, age, performance, WHO grade, location, size, surgical extent, and PORT on local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up period for survivors was 88.1 months. The 5-/10-year LC, PFS, and OS rates were 64.8%/54.0%, 56.4%/44.8%, and 76.6%/71.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, adjuvant PORT significantly improved LC (P = 0.002), PFS (P = 0.002), and OS (P = 0.043). Older age (P < 0.001), WHO grade III (P < 0.001), larger tumor size (P = 0.004), and lesser surgical extent (P < 0.001) were also negative factors for OS. Adjuvant PORT also improved LC (P = 0.010), PFS (P = 0.007), and OS (P = 0.069) on multivariate analysis for grade II IEPNs. Conclusion(s): This multicenter retrospective study supports the role of adjuvant PORT in terms of disease control and survival in adult grade II-III IEPNs.

3963,"Interactions between intraspinal Schwann cells and the cellular constituents normally occurring in the spinal cord: an ultrastructural study in the irradiated rat. Relationships between intraspinal Schwann cells and neuroglia, particularly, astrocytes, were studied following X-irradiation of the spinal cord in 3-day-old rats. Initially, this exposure results in a depletion of the neuroglial population. By 10 days post-irradiation (P-I), gaps occur in the glia limitans, although the overlying basal lamina remains intact. Development of and myelination by intraspinal Schwann cells is well underway by 15 days P-I. These Schwann cell-occupied regions have a paucity of astrocyte processes, a finding which persists throughout the study (60 days P-I), and several types of Schwann cell-neuroglial interfaces are observed, including: (1) astrocyte separation of Schwann cells from oligodendrocyte-myelinated regions; (2) intermingling of Schwann cell-myelinated axons and oligodendrocyte-myelinated axons in the absence of astrocyte processes; and (3) ensheathment of unmyelinated axons by astrocyte processes which separate these axons from the Schwann cells. The gaps in the glia limitans widen as the P-I interval increases. At 45 and 60 days P-I, the basal lamina no longer forms a singular, continuous covering over the spinal cord surface, but follows instead a rather tortuous course over the disrupted glia limitans and the intraspinal Schwann cells. Although the mode of initial occurrence of Schwann cells within the spinal cord is not yet understood, the data indicate that the astrocyte population is involved in that process, as well as in limiting the further development of Schwann cells within the substance of the spinal cord.",Excluded
4762,"Hippocampal-sparing and target volume coverage in treating 3 to 10 brain metastases: A comparison of Gamma Knife, single-isocenter VMAT, CyberKnife, and TomoTherapy stereotactic radiosurgery. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate hippocampal doses and target volume coverage with and without hippocampal sparing when treating multiple brain metastases using various stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) platforms.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We selected 10 consecutive patients with 14 separate treatments who had been treated in our department for 3 to 10 brain metastases and added hippocampal avoidance contours. All 14 treatments were planned with GammaPlan for Gamma Knife, Eclipse for single isocenter volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), TomoTherapy Treatment Planning System (TPS) for TomoTherapy, and MultiPlan for CyberKnife. Initial planning was performed with the goal of planning target volume coverage of V100 >=95% without hippocampal avoidance. If the maximum hippocampal point dose (Dmax) was <6.6 Gy in a single fraction and <40% of the hippocampi received <=4.5 Gy, no second plan was performed. If either constraint was not met, replanning was performed with these constraints.RESULTS: There was a median of 6 metastases per plan, with an average total tumor volume of 7.32 mL per plan. The median hippocampal Dmax (in Gy) without sparing averaged 1.65, 9.81, 4.38, and 5.46, respectively (P < .0001). Of 14 plans, 3 Gamma Knife and CyberKnife plans required replanning, whereas 13 VMAT and 8 TomoTherapy plans required replanning. The hippocampal constraints were not achievable in 1 plan on any platform when the tumor was bordering the hippocampus. The mean volume of brain receiving 12 Gy (in mL), which has been associated with symptomatic radionecrosis, was 23.57 with Gamma Knife, 76.77 with VMAT, 40.86 with CyberKnife, and 104.06 with TomoTherapy (P = .01). The overall average conformity indices for all plans ranged from 0.36 to 0.52.CONCLUSIONS: Even with SRS, the hippocampi can receive a considerable dose; however, if the hippocampi are outlined as organs of risk, sparing these structures is feasible in nearly all situations with all 4 platforms, without detriment to target coverage, and should be considered in all patients undergoing SRS for multiple brain metastases.SUMMARY: Hippocampi play an important role in memory, and sparing of these structures in whole brain radiation can improve neurocognitive outcomes. The hippocampi are not routinely spared when using stereotactic radiosurgery. We evaluated the incidental dose to the hippocampi when treating multiple brain metastases and sought to examine if hippocampal sparing is feasible without detriment to target coverage. We found that hippocampal sparing is possible without affecting coverage or conformality in most cases across treatment platforms.",Excluded
4187,Correlations of neuronal spike discharges of VL neurons during spontaneous firing and during the activity evoked by peripheral stimulation. The temporal relations between simultaneously recorded neurons of the nucleus ventralis lateralis (VL) of cat thalamus were studied. The interaction and the functional connections between individual VL neurons are described. This was achieved with an application of cross correlation techniques. The response patterns of different individual neurons to somatic sensory and photic stimuli were also analyzed. For the purpose of classifying neurons as thalamocortical relay cells (T-C) and non relay cells (N-C) which do not project to the motor sensory cortex antidromic cortical stimulation was used. This stimulation was also used as conditioning one when proceeded peripheral stimuli. To analyze the nonspecific specific interactions upon single neurons conditioning photic stimuli were applied. The results show that T-C neurons are antidromically excited from a wide cortical areas and that the functional interaction between T-C neurons is mediated by a shared input from common sources. It is further postulated that N-C cells interposed between relay neurons subserve the functions of gating units modifying the neuronal network of lateral ventral nucleus of the thalamus.,Excluded

To ascertain how photic stimuli disturbing overt circadian rhythms affect the endogenous rhythmicity of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), rats were subjected to constant light (LL) or to a 9-h light pulse encompassing midnight, and rhythms of abundance of the c-Fos-immunoreactive (c-Fos-ir) and the PER1-immunoreactive (PER1-ir) cells were studied during the first 1-2 cycles following release into LL or darkness (DD) within the whole SCN as well as in its ventrolateral (vl) and the dorsomedial (dm) part. LL seemingly abolished the c-Fos rhythm in the whole SCN, while the rhythm persisted in the vl- and dm-SCN. In the dm-SCN, the rhythm of c-Fos-ir was phase-delayed by about 4 h in LL, whereas the rhythm of PER1-ir was affected just slightly. In the vl-SCN, the rhythm of c-Fos photo-induction might be delayed by 5-6 h as compared with the reported rhythm [A. Sumova and H. Illnerova, Am. J.

After a 9-h light pulse encompassing midnight, the rhythm of PER1-ir in the dm-SCN changed just slightly, whereas the PER1 rhythm in the vl-SCN was abolished and there was just an indication of extension of elevated PER1-ir.

3850,"Cerebral Cortex Regions Selectively Vulnerable to Radiation Dose-Dependent Atrophy. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: Neurologic deficits after brain radiation therapy (RT) typically involve decline in higher-order cognitive functions such as attention and memory rather than sensory defects or paralysis. We sought to determine whether areas of the cortex critical to cognition are selectively vulnerable to radiation dose-dependent atrophy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We measured change in cortical thickness in 54 primary brain tumor patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT. The study patients underwent high-resolution, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted; T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, FLAIR) before RT and 1 year afterward. Semiautomated software was used to segment anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex for each patient. Cortical thickness was measured for each region before RT and 1 year afterward. Two higher-order cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were tested for association between radiation dose and cortical thinning: entorhinal (memory) and inferior parietal (attention/memory). For comparison, 2 primary cortex ROIs were also tested: pericalcarine (vision) and paracentral lobule (somatosensory/motor). Linear mixed-effects analyses were used to test all other cortical regions for significant radiation dose-dependent thickness change. Statistical significance was set at alpha = 0.05 using 2-tailed tests.RESULTS: Cortical atrophy was significantly associated with radiation dose in the entorhinal (P=.01) and inferior parietal ROIs (P=.02). By contrast, no significant radiation dose-dependent effect was found in the primary cortex ROIs (pericalcarine and paracentral lobule). In the whole-cortex analysis, 9 regions showed significant radiation dose-dependent atrophy, including areas responsible for memory, attention, and executive function (P<=.002).CONCLUSIONS: Areas of cerebral cortex important for higher-order cognition may be most vulnerable to radiation-related atrophy. This is consistent with clinical observations that brain radiation patients experience deficits in domains of memory, executive function, and attention. Correlations of regional cortical atrophy with domain-specific cognitive functioning in prospective trials are warranted.",Excluded
3856,"Phase I trial of escalated doses of targeted marrow/lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) delivered by tomotherapy combined with etoposide and cyclophosphamide; an allogeneic HCT preparative regimen for patients with refractory leukemia. Introduction: The overall survival (OS) for relapsed (RL) acute leukemia patients or those considered induction failure (IF) treated with HCT is 16-19% (Duval et al., JCO 2010). While randomized studies have shown a dose response relationship, with higher doses of radiation resulting in decreased relapse, this benefit is off set by increased treatment related mortality. Materials (or patients) and Methods: To explore the safety and tolerability of targeted radiation treatment in the context of HCT, a phase I trial is being conducted in which escalated doses of targeted whole body radiation is delivered to marrow bearing and lymphoid areas, while sparing non hematopoietic (vital) organs. The transplant preparative regimen is as follows: TMLI on days -10 to -6; etoposide 60mg/kg [adj bw] on day -5 with cyclophosphamide 100mg/kg [ideal bw] on day -3. The radiation dose was started at 1200cGy delivered in 150 cGy fractions twice a day. Initially the dose of radiation was escalated in increments of 150 cGy to 1500 cGy using standard 3x3 design and then 100 cGy incrementally to a maximum of 2000 cGy using rolling 6 design. Dose limiting toxicity is defined according to the Bearman and CTCAE 3.0 (for hematologic toxicity) scales. Liver and brain dose was kept at 1200 cGy. Median normal organs received 16-60% of the marrow dose (lung 44%, esophagus 33% and oral cavity 28%). All patients received peripheral blood stem cells on day 0.

Patient characteristics: AML n=27, ALL Ph- n=10, ALL Ph+ n=2, Biphenotypic n=2; disease status at HCT, 1RL n=13, 2RL n=2, IF n=26; cytogenetic risk(SWOG criteria): intermediate n=19, unfavorable n=15 and unknown significance n=7 median KPS at HCT 90 (60-100); donor source sibling n=20, HLA matched unrelated n=5, mismatched (1 allele) unrelated n=16; WBC at HCT median 1.5 (0.1-14.9) % blasts (blood) at HCT median 2% (0-85%) % blasts (marrow) at HCT median 46% (10-90%) Two patients presented with extramedullary disease at time of HCT. With a median follow-up for alive patients of 9.9 months (1.0- 53.4), the OS and cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 1 year are 52% (95%CI: 32.9-68.1) and 45% (95%CI: 30.9-65.5) respectively. Two patients are currently being treated at 1900 cGy dose, MTD has not been declared. All patients treated at >= 1700 cGy achieved CR at the day 30 post transplant evaluation. Twenty (49%) of patients developed acute GvHD; 6(30%) of these developed grades 3-4. The day 30 and day 100 NRM was 0% and 5.3% respectively.

In conclusion, our results demonstrated that higher doses of ionizing radiation (IR) can cause persistent upregulation of mitochondrial degeneration. Reduced levels of Sqstm1 and Bcl2 can lead to intensive autophagy which can lead to degradation of cellular structure.",Included
3941,"Thiol activation of endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15. A novel mechanism for the regulation of catalytic activity. Endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP24.15) is a thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidase involved in the regulated metabolism of a number of neuropeptides. Unlike other thermolysin-like peptidases EP24.15 displays a unique thiol activation, a mechanism that is not clearly understood. In this study we show that both recombinant and tissue-derived EP24.15 are activated up to 8-fold by low concentrations (0.1 mM) of dithiothreitol. Additionally, under non-reducing conditions, recombinant and native EP24.15 forms multimers that can be returned to the monomeric form by reduction. We have also shown that competitive inhibitor binding occurs only to the monomeric form, which indicates that catalytic site access is restricted in the multimeric forms. Through systematic site-directed mutagenesis we have identified that cysteine residues 246, 253, and possibly 248 are involved in the formation of these multimers. Furthermore, both a double mutant (C246S/C253S) and a triple mutant (C246S/C248S/C253S) are fully active in the absence of reducing agents, as measured by both inhibitor binding and hydrolysis. The formation and disruption of disulfide bonds involving these cysteine residues may be a mechanism by which EP24.15 activity is regulated through changes in intra- and extracellular redox potential.",Excluded
4727,"Serine/threonine kinase BUB1 promotes proliferation and radio-resistance in glioblastoma. BUB1 (Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1), a mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase, has been linked in numerous cancers to pro-tumorigenic phenomena including elevation of cellular proliferation, tumor growth, metastatic potential, and poorer patient prognosis. However, the role of BUB1 in glioblastoma remains poorly investigated. In this study, clinical analyses determined significant enrichment of BUB1 in glioblastoma with direct correlation of elevated expression to poorer prognosis in glioma patients. Genetic inhibition of BUB1 in glioblastoma tumor cells via shRNA silencing diminished both proliferative ability and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of BUB1 was additionally determined to promote the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on glioblastoma tumor cells, and investigation of the underlying pathways revealed the roles of DNA mismatch repair, spliceosome and c-Myc pathways. Mechanistically, FOXM1 was determined to positively regulate transcription of BUB1 via direct promoter region binding. For validation, pharmacologic inhibition through administration of a BUB1 inhibitor demonstrated attenuated glioblastoma cellular proliferation in vitro as well as delayed tumor growth with prolonged survival in vivo. Collectively, this study demonstrates a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma in the form of BUB1, which plays a pivotal role in GBM proliferative and radio-resistance capacities in a FOXM1-dependant manner.",Excluded
4087,"Sacral plexus injury after radiotherapy for carcinoma of cervix. A 42-year-old woman developed lower extremity weakness and sensory loss 1 year after external and intracavitary radiotherapy for Stage IB carcinoma of cervix. She has been followed for 5 years posttreatment, and the neurologic abnormalities have persisted, but no evidence of recurrent carcinoma has been found. We believe this to be a rare case of sacral plexus radiculopathy developing as a late complication after radiotherapy. Suggestions are made for improving the radiotherapy technique to prevent this complication in future cases.",Excluded
4042,"Fast acquisition cone-beam computed tomography: Initial experience with a 10 s protocol. Background Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) facilitates the acquisition of cross-sectional imaging in angiography suites using a rotational C-arm and digital flat panel detectors. The applications are numerous, including evaluation of implanted devices and localization of cerebrovascular lesions. We present and validate the clinical utility of an alternative fast CBCT acquisition protocol in the context of neurovascular device imaging. Methods Contrast-enhanced (CE)-CBCT images were acquired using a new 10 s protocol in a phantom head model, swine model, and in patients. The acquisition parameters of both the 10 s and 20 s protocols were exactly the same, except for fewer projections (250 projections in 10 s vs 500 projections in 20 s), resulting in reduced scan time. Image quality was measured quantitatively in a controlled phantom study and qualitatively by blinded reviewers. The latter was performed to assess the image quality of the 10 s protocol pertinent to the device visibility and its apposition to the parent artery. Results 10 s CBCT images were comparable to 20 s CBCT in both phantom and animal studies. Of the 25 patient images, the reviewers agreed that they were able to discern the flow diverter struts and assess the apposition in all images. The overall rating for all 10 s images was 4.28 on a 5-point scale. No images were rated as less than 3, which was the average diagnostic quality. The ratings were concordant across three blinded reviewers (kappa =0.411). Additionally, contrast and spatial resolution between 10 s and 20 s images were similar in non-human models. Conclusions CBCT images of neurovascular devices can be obtained successfully using a 10 s acquisition protocol. In addition, the 10 s protocol offers faster acquisition, thus allowing its use in awake patients and with an added advantage of lower radiation and contrast dose.

4190,"Effects of low intensity radiofrequency electromagnetic fields on electrical activity in rat hippocampal slices. Slices of rat hippocampus were exposed to 700 MHz continuous wave radiofrequency (RF) fields (25.2-71.0 V m(-1), 5-15 min exposure) in a stripline waveguide. At low field intensities, the predominant effect on the electrically evoked field potential in CA1 was a potentiation of the amplitude of the population spike by up to 20%, but higher intensity fields could produce either increases or decreases of up to 120 and 80%, respectively, in the amplitude of the population spike. To eliminate the possibility of RF-induced artefacts due to the metal stimulating electrode, the effect of RF exposure on spontaneous epileptiform activity induced in CA3 by 4-aminopyridine (50-100 microM) was investigated. Exposure to RF fields (50.0 V m(-1)) reduced or abolished epileptiform bursting in 36% of slices tested. The maximum field intensity used in these experiments, 71.0 V m(-1), was calculated to produce a specific absorption rate (SAR) of between 0.0016 and 0.0044 W kg(-1) in the slices. Measurements with a Luxtron fibreoptic probe confirmed that there was no detectable temperature change (+/- 0.1 degrees C) during a 15 min exposure to this field intensity. Furthermore, imposed temperature changes of up to 1 degrees C failed to mimic the effects of RF exposure. These results suggest that low-intensity RF fields can modulate the excitability of hippocampal tissue in vitro in the absence of gross thermal effects. The changes in excitability may be consistent with reported behavioural effects of RF fields.",Excluded
4165,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [18F]FEDAA1106: a human whole-body PET study. PURPOSE: [(18)F]FEDAA1106 is a recently developed positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for in vivo quantification of the 18 kDa translocator protein [TSPO or, as earlier called, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)]. TSPO imaging is expected to be useful for the clinical evaluation of neuroinflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to provide dosimetry estimates for [(18)F]FEDAA1106 based on human whole-body PET measurements.METHODS: PET scans were performed for a total of 6.6 h after the injection of 183.8 +/- 9.1 MBq of [(18)F]FEDAA1106 in six healthy subjects. Regions of interest were drawn on coronal images. Estimates of the absorbed doses of radiation were calculated using the OLINDA software.RESULTS: Peak uptake was largest in lungs, followed by liver, small intestine, kidney, spleen and other organs. Peak values of the percent injected dose (%ID) at a time after radioligand injection were calculated for the lungs (27.1%ID at 0.2 h), liver (21.1%ID at 0.6 h), small intestine (10.4%ID at 6.3 h), kidney (4.9%ID at 1.8 h) and spleen (4.6%ID at 0.6 h). The largest absorbed dose was found in the spleen (0.12 mSv/MBq), followed by kidneys (0.094 mSv/MBq). The calculated mean effective dose was 0.036 mSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the estimated radiation burden of [(18)F]FEDAA1106 is moderately higher than that of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). In clinical studies, the administered activity of this radioligand ought to be adjusted in line with regional regulations. This result would be helpful for further clinical TSPO imaging studies.",Excluded
4244,"Radiation dose response of neurologic symptom improvement during radiotherapy for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. PURPOSE: To investigate the association between radiation dose response and neurologic symptom improvement and survival outcomes in patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). METHODS AND MATERIALS: 108 patients with newly-diagnosed DIPG were treated with conventionally-fractionated radiation therapy (RT) to 54Gy (median) at our institution from 2006 to 2014. The presence and severity of neurological symptoms related to cranial neuropathy (CN) and cerebellar (CB) and long tract (LT) signs prior to and weekly during RT was reviewed for each patient. The incidence and rate of change of each symptom category was evaluated to determine the impact of clinical variables and brain sub-region volumes using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULT(S): Median dose to first sign of symptomatic improvement was 16.2Gy (CN), 21.6Gy (CB) and 19.8Gy (LT). Most patients showed any improvement by 20Gy. Black race was associated with improved LT signs at significantly lower cumulative RT doses (P=0.027). Larger uninvolved brainstem volume alone and normalized to total brain (TB) or posterior fossa volume (PF) was associated with a shorter time to LT sign improvement (P=0.044, P=0.033, and P=0.05, respectively). Patients with any improvement in CN experienced significantly prolonged progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.002 and P=0.008, respectively). Tumor volume, with or without normalization to TB or PF, was not significantly associated with PFS or OS. CONCLUSION(S): Low cumulative doses of RT provided neurologic improvement in the majority of patients with DIPG. Brain sub-region volumes influenced time to symptomatic improvement, while neurologic improvement was associated with superior survival outcomes.",Excluded
