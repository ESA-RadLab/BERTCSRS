2386,"Neural tracts injuries in patients with hypoxic ischemic brain injury: Diffusion tensor imaging study. Many studies have reported on vulnerable areas of the brain in hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HI-BI). However, little is known about the involvement of neural tracts following HI-BI. We investigated neural tract injuries in adult patients with HI-BI, using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Twelve consecutive patients with HI-BI and 12 control subjects were recruited for this study. We classified the patients into two subgroups according to the preservation of alertness: subgroup A-5 patients who had intact alertness and subgroup B-7 patients who had impaired alertness. DTI-Studio software was used for evaluation of seven neural tracts: corticospinal, cingulum, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and optic radiation. We measured the DTT parameters (fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient and voxel number) of each neural tract. In the individual analysis, all 12 patients showed injuries in all 24 neural tracts in terms of both DTT parameters and integrity, except for the corticospinal tract (75.0% injury). In the group analysis, the patient group showed neural injuries in all 24 neural tracts. In comparison of subgroups A and B, subgroup B showed more severe injuries: subgroup B showed a higher rate of disruption (39.8%) than subgroup A (12.9%) on individual DTTs and subgroup B had more severe injuries in both the cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. In conclusion, we found that extensive injuries in the neural tracts were accompanied by HI-BI. Patients with impaired alertness appeared to show more severe injuries of neural tracts. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded

Whole-body irradiation leads to delayed cognitive dysfunction which could result from perturbations of neurotransmission, specially the dopaminergic and the serotoninergic one. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites in three cerebral areas of rats, one month after (neutron-gamma) irradiation at 3,38 Gy. An increase of DA, 5-HT, and their catabolites was observed. These effects are weak but observed in older rats.",Included
1449,"The role of systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases from small-cell lung cancer. Brain is the most common site of metastatic spread in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Approximately 10% of SCLC patients have brain metastases (BM) already at diagnosis and an additional 40% will develop central nervous system (CNS) involvement during their disease course. Although whole brain radiotherapy and corticosteroids is considered the treatment of choice, accumulating evidence suggests that systemic chemotherapy may also play an important role. The concept of the brain as a pharmacologic sanctuary site for established metastases is in contrast with recent clinical observations of frequent BM responses with systemic chemotherapy. During the last decade, several reports about the effect of systemic chemotherapy on BM from SCLC have been published. Pooled data from five studies report 66% response rate (RR) in 64 patients with initial BM. In addition, an average RR of 36% is derived from five studies including 135 patients with delayed BM treated with systemic single agent chemotherapy. Among new drugs with activity in patients with SCLC brain metastases, camptothecin analog topotecan is one of the most promising with a 52% RR. Although whole brain radiation remains the standard treatment of established BM in SCLC there is an emerging role for systemic chemotherapy, particularly with the use of new active drugs as part of combined modality treatments.

1612,"Increased seroreactivity to glioma-expressed antigen 2 in brain tumor patients under radiation. BACKGROUND: Surgery and radiation are the mainstays of therapy for human gliomas that are the most common primary brain tumors. Most recently, cell culture and animal studies provided the first convincing evidence that radiation not only eliminates tumor cells, but also modulates the immune response and likely improves anti-tumor immunotherapy.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present an in vivo study that analyzes the effects of radiation on the immune response in tumor patients. As readout system, we utilized the reactivity of glioma patients' sera against antigen GLEA2 as the most frequent antigen immunogenic in glioblastoma patients. We established an ELISA assay to analyze reactivity of 24 glioblastoma patients over a period of several months. As control we used 30 sera from healthy donors as well as 30 sera from lung cancer patients. We compared the course of GLEA2 seroreactivity at different times prior, during and after radiation. The GLEA2 seroreactivity was increased by the time of surgery, decreased after surgery, increased again under radiation, and slightly decreased after radiation.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide in vivo evidence for an increased antibody response against tumor antigens under radiation. Antigens that become immunogenic with an increased antibody response as result of radiation can serve as ideal targets for immunotherapy of human tumors.",Excluded

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinical subgroups using an empirically identified psychoneurologic symptom cluster (depressed mood, cognitive disturbance, fatigue, insomnia, and pain) and to examine the differences among subgroups in the selected demographic and clinical variables, as well as in patient outcome (i.e., functional performance).DESIGN: Secondary analysis.SETTING: A university health science center in Salt Lake City, UT, and a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center in Philadelphia, PA.SAMPLE: 282 patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy.METHODS: Cluster analyses were conducted to identify subgroups. Multinomial logistic regression and one-way analyses of variance were used to examine the differences among subgroups.MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Depressed mood, cognitive disturbance, fatigue, insomnia, pain, and functional performance.FINDINGS: Patients were classified into four distinct subgroups based on their symptom cluster experience: all low symptom, high fatigue and low pain, high pain, and all high symptom. Such patient classification patterns were consistent across the treatment trajectory, although group memberships were inconsistent. After initiating treatment, two additional subgroups emerged: high depressed mood and cognitive disturbance, and high fatigue and insomnia. Subgroups differed in physical performance status at baseline, symptom burden, and treatment modality in a relatively consistent pattern across time points. Patients in the all-high-symptom subgroup experienced the most serious limitations in activities across all time points.CONCLUSIONS: Patient subgroups exist that share the unique experience of psychoneurologic symptoms.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Findings are useful to determine who needs more intensive symptom management during cancer treatment.

1593,"External beam radiotherapy for painful bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma: multiple fractions compared with an 8-Gy single fraction. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) bone metastases has not been popular in palliative therapy, and optimum dose schedules have not been decided because of limited published reports. We here evaluated the palliative effect of EBRT for HCC bone metastases and compared the dose-response relationship between multiple fractions (MFs) and an 8-Gy single fraction (SF). Twenty-eight patients (42 sites) with painful bone metastases who received EBRT and were analyzed retrospectively. Eight patients (12 sites) received SF. Of the remaining 20 patients (30 sites), 10 received MFs at moderate doses (20-30 Gy; 17 sites) and 10 received MFs at high doses (36-52 Gy; 13 sites). Overall response was achieved at 83% (35) of all sites; 75% (9) and 87% (26) for the SF and MF patients (88%, moderate dose; 85%, high dose), respectively. No significant differences in overall response were observed between each fraction schedule. Response duration was significantly longer for the high-dose MF patients than for the SF patients and moderate-dose MF patients (P < 0.05).

2504,"Treatment of spinal cord ependymomas by surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of complete resection and postoperative radiotherapy in spinal cord ependymomas. Methods and materials: We conducted a retrospective study over 20 patients (13 males and 7 females) with histologically confirmed spinal cord ependymomas between July 1985 and April 2001. Among them, 13 patients had ependymomas, 6 had myxopapillary ependymomas, and 1 had anaplastic ependymoma. All patients received radical surgery for tumor removal with 13 patients achieving complete resection and 7 incomplete resection due to technical difficulty. Among those with incomplete resection, 6 patients received postoperative radiotherapy to tumor bed and only one patient with anaplastic ependymoma received surgery alone. The total tumor dose ranged from 50 to 60 Gy. Result(s): Among the 20 patients, 19 patients were alive and showed local control. The median survival time of all patients was 109 months, with 104 months in the complete resection alone group and 135 months in the incomplete resection with postoperative radiotherapy group. One patient with anaplastic ependymoma and no postoperative radiotherapy developed leptomeningeal seeding 9 months after surgery. Salvage therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy maintained normal neurological functions. The patient expired 34 months from the initial diagnosis due to progression of leptomeningeal seeding. Conclusion(s): Complete resection alone in spinal cord ependymoma can achieve excellent local control and survival. Patients should receive complete resection if technically possible. Postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended for complete resection. For incomplete resection, postoperative local radiotherapy is recommended and it can also achieve excellent local control and survival. Local radiotherapy with 50-60 Gy is effective and safe. Salvage radiotherapy improves quality of life for local recurrence or leptomeningeal seeding patients. © Springer 2005.",Included
1402,"Weiss Lecture. Effects of radiations of different qualities on cells: molecular mechanisms of damage and repair. Studies of ionizing radiations of different quality are discussed with particular emphasis on damage to DNA of mammalian cells. Three related themes are followed. Firstly, inactivation and mutation experiments with ultrasoft X-rays and slow heavy ions, coupled with theoretical analyses of the structures of the radiation tracks, have emphasized the biological importance of localized track features over nanometre dimensions. This led to the suggestion that the critical physical features of the tracks are the stochastic clusterings of ionizations, directly in or very near to DNA, resulting in clustered initial molecular damage including various combinations of breaks, base damages, cross-links, etc. in the DNA. The quantitative hypotheses imply that final cellular effects from high-LET radiations are dominated by their more severe, and therefore less repairable, clustered damage, and that these are qualitatively different from the dominant low-LET damage. Second, relative effectiveness of different types of radiation led to questions on the mechanisms of induction of chromosome exchanges. The high efficiency of ultrasoft X-rays, despite their very short track lengths, suggested that single sites of DNA damage may lead to exchanges by a molecular process involving interaction with undamaged DNA. Also it is shown that a single site-specific DNA break, introduced by restriction enzymes, sometimes leads to a large deletion when misrepaired by cell extracts. These deletions occur between short DNA repeats, and are therefore a form of 'illegitimate' recombination, but clearly do not involve the interaction of two damage sites. Third, it was shown that cells from patients with the radiosensitive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) lack a post-irradiation recovery process. The sensitivity of AT cells to high LET radiations was found to be reduced relative to that for normal cells, reinforcing the concept that high LET damage is less easy to repair. AT patients are prone to lymphoreticular cancers, and their cells show characteristic chromosomal rearrangements, which may be associated with misrepair at specific genomic sequences. Similarly, studies of radiation-induced leukaemia in the mouse have implicated rearrangement at specific interstitial chromosome sites, which are rich in telomere-like repeat sequences.

1503,"Complete homonymous hemianopia due to cerebral infarction of the lateral geniculate body: A case report with diffusion tensor image findings. Background: The human lateral geniculate body (LGB) is the thalamic visual center linking the retina to the striate cortex. The human LGB has dual blood supplies from the anterior choroidal artery of the internal carotid artery and the lateral posterior choroidal artery of the posterior cerebral artery. Thus, complete homonemous hemianopia caused by cerebral infarction of the LGB is extremely rare. Case Report: A 63-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus presented due to a sudden visual field defect. He had no other vascular risk factors or focal neurological deficits. Five days later, complete right homonymous hemianopia was detected by Humphrey automated perimetry. Brain MRI and DWI revealed an infarction at the left LGB. MRA revealed no obstruction or stenosis. Diffusion tensor image (DTI) showed decreased fractional anisotrophy value in the left occipital subcortical area (right, 0.436; left, 0.384). The density of optic radiation decreased more on the right side in tractography than on the left side. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Quadruple sectoranopia can be caused by lesions in the medial and lateral portions of the LGB which are supplied by the anterior choroidal artery. The lateral posterior choroidal artery supplies the central part of the LGB. Thus, occlusion of this artery produces a wedge-shaped homonymous hemianopsia or horizontal sectoranopia. However, despite the LGB lesion, our patient showed a complete homonemous hemianopia probably due to involvement of the whole LGB through occlusion of a variant vessel that supplied the whole LGB rather than simultaneous occlusion of 2 vessels. The patient's DTI findings were well consistent with his clinical features.",Excluded

2167,"Persistent calcium current in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons. The suprachiasmatic nuclei contain the primary circadian clock, and suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons exhibit a diurnal modulation of spontaneous firing rate. The present study examined the voltage-gated persistent Ca(2+) current, in acutely isolated rat suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons using a ramp-type voltage-clamp protocol. Slow triangular voltage-clamp commands from a holding potential of -85 mV to +5 mV elicited inward current (100-400 pA) that was completely blocked by Cd(2+). This current showed little or no hysteresis, and was identified as persistent Ca(2+) current. The threshold for persistent Ca(2+) current ranged between -60 and -45 mV, and it was maximal at about -8 mV. Nifedipine at 10-20 microM blocked 80-100%. To assess the role of persistent Ca(2+) current in the generation of spontaneous action potentials in both acutely isolated and intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons, the effect of Cd(2+) and nifedipine on firing rate was studied using on-cell recording. Application of Cd(2+) exerted a weak excitatory effect and nifedipine had no significant effect on the spontaneous firing rate of isolated suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. In all intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations (n=15), Cd(2+) slowly inhibited spontaneous firing; in high-frequency firing cells (four of 15), a transient increase of firing rate preceded inhibition. No significant effect of nifedipine on firing rate of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons was found. Therefore, persistent Ca(2+) current itself (as carrier of charge) does not appear to contribute significantly to spontaneous firing of suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. A slowly developing inhibitory effect of Cd(2+) on spontaneous firing of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations may be due to penetration of Cd(2+) through Ca(2+) channels, and its subsequent effect on intracellular mechanisms, while the transient increase of firing rate in high-frequency firing neurons is probably due to inhibition of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current.",Excluded

1240,"ATM is upregulated during the mitogenic response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients with the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) are characterized by immunodeficiency and a predisposition to develop lymphoid malignancies. The gene mutated in A-T patients, ATM, codes for a high molecular weight protein that is implicated in DNA damage recognition and cell cycle control. The ATM protein does not change in amount or cellular distribution throughout the cell cycle or in response to DNA damaging agents. Because peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are largely in a state of quiescence and can be readily stimulated to enter a proliferative phase and because A-T cells exhibit growth abnormalities and senescence, indicative of a general intracellular defect in signalling, we chose PBMCs to examine the relationship of ATM to the proliferative status of the cell. We show here that ATM protein is present at low levels in freshly isolated PBMCs and increases approximately 6-fold to 10-fold in response to a mitogenic stimulus, reaching a maximum after 3 to 4 days. A similar, but delayed response, was evident in the presence of serum only. This increase in ATM protein was accompanied by an increase in ATM kinase activity. While expression of ATM protein increased during proliferation, ATM mRNA expression was unchanged in stimulated and unstimulated cells and there was no evidence for increased ATM protein stability in the phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-treated cells. In keeping with the reduced levels of ATM in quiescent cells, the extent of radiation-induction of the p53 pathway was significantly lower than in mitogen-stimulated cells. Basal levels of p21 were elevated in quiescent cells, and the response to radiation was negligible or reduced compared with proliferating cells over a 2-hour period. Overall, the data suggest that the increase in ATM protein in proliferating cells is due to posttranscriptional regulation and points to a role for ATM in more general signalling.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: One third of all cancer patients will develop bone metastases and the vertebral column is involved in approximately 70% of these patients. Conventional radiotherapy with of 1-10 fractions and total doses of 8-30 Gy is the current standard for painful vertebral metastases; however, the median pain response is short with 3-6 months and local tumor control is limited with these rather low irradiation doses. Recent advances in radiotherapy technology - intensity modulated radiotherapy for generation of highly conformal dose distributions and image-guidance for precise treatment delivery - have made dose-escalated radiosurgery of spinal metastases possible and early results of pain and local tumor control are promising. The current study will investigate efficacy and safety of radiosurgery for painful vertebral metastases and three characteristics will distinguish this study. 1) A prognostic score for overall survival will be used for selection of patients with longer life expectancy to allow for analysis of long-term efficacy and safety. 2) Fractionated radiosurgery will be performed with the number of treatment fractions adjusted to either good (10 fractions) or intermediate (5 fractions) life expectancy. Fractionation will allow inclusion of tumors immediately abutting the spinal cord due to higher biological effective doses at the tumor - spinal cord interface compared to single fraction treatment. 3) Dose intensification will be performed in the involved parts of the vertebrae only, while uninvolved parts are treated with conventional doses using the simultaneous integrated boost concept.METHODS / DESIGN: It is the study hypothesis that hypo-fractionated image-guided radiosurgery significantly improves pain relief compared to historic data of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Primary endpoint is pain response 3 months after radiosurgery, which is defined as pain reduction of >= 2 points at the treated vertebral site on the 0 to 10 Visual Analogue Scale. 60 patients will be included into this two-centre phase II trial.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study will refine the methods of patient selection, target volume definition, treatment planning and delivery as well as quality assurance for radiosurgery.

INTRODUCTION: CT-angiography gains an increasing role in the initial diagnosis of patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, the implementation of CT-angiography does not always exclude the necessity of conventional angiography. Our objective was to determine the practical utility and cost-effectiveness of CT-angiography.METHODS: All patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted to our university hospital after implementation of CT-angiography between June 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012 were retrospectively analyzed in regard to factors of treatment flow, radiation exposure, harms of contrast medium loading, and diagnostic costs. A control group of the same size was assembled from previously admitted SAH patients, who did not undergo pretreatment CT-angiography. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analysis was performed.RESULTS: The final analysis consisted of 93 patients in each group. Of 93 patients with pretreatment CT-angiography, 74 had to undergo conventional angiography for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. CT-angiography had significant impact on the reduction of collective effective radiation dose by 4.419 mSv per person (p = 0.0002) and was not associated with additional harms. Despite the significantly earlier detection of aneurysms with CT-angiography (p < 0.0001), there were no significant differences in the timing of aneurysm repair and duration of ICU and general hospital stay. There was an increase of diagnostic costs-the cost-effectiveness analysis showed, however, that benefits of CT-angiography in respect to radiation exposure and risk of conventional angiography-related complications justify the additional costs of CT-angiography.CONCLUSIONS: Although the implementation of CT-angiography in SAH diagnosis cannot completely replace conventional angiography, it can be approved in regard to radiation hygiene and cost-effectiveness.",Excluded

In nature, sounds from multiple sources sum at the eardrums, generating complex cues for sound localization and identification. In this clutter, the auditory system must determine ""what is where."" We examined this process in the auditory space map of the barn owl's (Tyto alba) inferior colliculus using two spatially separated sources simultaneously emitting uncorrelated noise bursts, which were uniquely identified by different frequencies of sinusoidal amplitude modulation. Spatial response profiles of isolated neurons were constructed by testing the source-pair centered at various locations in virtual auditory space. The neurons responded whenever a source was placed within the receptive field, generating two clearly segregated foci of activity at appropriate loci. The spike trains were locked strongly to the amplitude modulation of the source within the receptive field, whereas the other source had minimal influence. Two sources amplitude modulated at the same rate were resolved successfully, suggesting that source separation is based on differences of fine structure. The spike rate and synchrony were stronger for whichever source had the stronger average binaural level. A computational model showed that neuronal activity was primarily proportional to the degree of matching between the momentary binaural cues and the preferred values of the neuron. The model showed that individual neurons respond to and synchronize with sources in their receptive field if there are frequencies having an average binaural-level advantage over a second source. Frequencies with interaural phase differences that are shared by both sources may also evoke activity, which may be synchronized with the amplitude modulations from either source.",Excluded

1844,"Textiloma mimicking a recurrent high-grade astrocytoma. Introduction: Textiloma (Txm) is defined as a foreign body-related inflammatory pseudotumor arising from retained nonabsorbable cotton matrix with the associated inflammatory reaction. In current neurosurgical practice, Txm often refers to a resorbable hemostatic agent that is intentionally left in place to prevent the potentially disastrous consequences of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage. Imaging is essential to the workup for Txm, but it cannot be easily distinguished from a recurrent tumor or abscess due to their nonspecific characteristics. Parameter calculations of diffusion weighted imaging are based on complex pharmacokinetic compartment models that allow only an approximation of the biological conditions. This report describes a case of a Txm mimicking a recurrent high-grade astrocytoma including altered advanced neuroimaging techniques in an effort to highlight this possibility in the setting of tumoral recurrence. Materials And Methods: A 69-year-old female presented to our facility with a 6-month history of progressive left-sided weakness. Neuroimaging studies revealed a large non-enhancing mass in the right frontoparietal lobe. Pathology reported a diffuse astrocytoma, WHO grade II with wildtype IDH-1, EGFR amplification and PTEN negative results. After surgical intervention, external beam radiation was given to the remaining areas of residual tumor. Routine MRI revealed a nodular area of contrast enhancement in the dorsal and inferior margin of the biopsy tract, growing between interval scans, perfusion-weighted imaging parameters were elevated, clinically asymptomatic. Result(s): She underwent a complete resection of this area of interest and pathology returned as a Txm with surgicel fibers. Reactive changes were also seen consistent with radiation effect and areas of atypical cells consistent with residual tumor but not significantly mitotically active. She did notrequire any further treatments and was on observation with imaging only for 14 months until another area of progression was seen. Conclusion(s): After treatment of a neoplasm, if unexpected clinical or imaging evidence of recurrence is present, it may be a foreign body reaction to hemostatic material used during the initial surgery. The implications of this case lie in recognizing this entity to avoid unnecessary procedures. Given the technical variability of advanced MRI techniques, there are limits to the sensitivity and specificity of such. The standardization of advanced MRI is well recognized as a pressing clinical and research need.",Excluded

Potential health and functional impacts associated with the various physiological changes during spaceflight are discussed, and areas needing additional research are highlighted. Historically, studies of physiological responses to microgravity have not been aimed at examining gender-specific differences in the astronaut population. Insufficient data exist in most of the discipline areas at this time to draw valid conclusions about genderspecific differences in astronauts, in part due to the small ratio of women to men. The only astronaut health issue for which a large enough data set exists to allow valid conclusions to be drawn about gender differences is orthostatic intolerance following shuttle missions, in which women have a significantly higher incidence of presyncope during stand tests than do men.

Bilateral muscles of mastication: medial and lateral pterygoids (MP and LP), masseters (M), temporalis (T), temporomandibular joint (TMJ) were contoured on CT images. The block comprised all muscles excluding the TMJ below the orbital floor. Mean dose, equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and V35-V60 Gy were compared with change in MID.RESULTS: In six patients, the MID deteriorated at 6 months from the start of radiotherapy compared with 14 whose MID improved. No significant association was observed between age, gender, smoking, alcohol status, exercise compliance, cisplatin, tumor site, stage, V35-V60 Gy or EUD with change in MID. A clinical outlier was excluded. Without the outlier (n = 19), a significant association was seen between mean dose and change in MID at 6 months for the ipsilateral block (p = .01), LP (p = .04) and M (p < .01). All patients where trismus deteriorated at 6 months received mean doses >40 Gy to the block.CONCLUSION: Higher mean radiation doses to the ipsilateral block, LP and M were significantly associated with deterioration in trismus. Limiting dose to these structures to <=40 Gy for tumors not invading the masticatory muscles may improve treatment-related sequelae. The ipsilateral block, LP and M should be studied further as possible alternative avoidance structures in radiotherapy treatment planning.",Excluded

Two clinical trials are currently running at the Finnish dedicated boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) facility. Between May 1999 and December 2001, 18 patients with supratentorial glioblastoma were treated with boronophenylalanine (BPA)-based BNCT within a context of a prospective clinical trial (protocol P-01). All patients underwent prior surgery, but none had received conventional radiotherapy or cancer chemotherapy before BNCT. BPA-fructose was given as 2-h infusion at BPA-dosages ranging from 290 to 400 mg/kg prior to neutron beam irradiation, which was given as a single fraction from two fields. The average planning target volume dose ranged from 30 to 61 Gy (W), and the average normal brain dose from 3 to 6 Gy (W). The treatment was generally well tolerated, and none of the patients have died during the first months following BNCT. The estimated 1-year overall survival is 61%. In another trial (protocol P-03), three patients with recurring or progressing glioblastoma following surgery and conventional cranial radiotherapy to 50-60 Gy, were treated with BPA-based BNCT using the BPA dosage of 290 mg/kg. The average planning target dose in these patients was 25-29 Gy (W), and the average whole brain dose 2-3 Gy (W). All three patients tolerated brain reirradiation with BNCT, and none died during the first three months following BNCT. We conclude that BPA-based BNCT has been relatively well tolerated both in previously irradiated and unirradiated glioblastoma patients. Efficacy comparisons with conventional photon radiation are difficult due to patient selection and confounding factors such as other treatments given, but the results support continuation of clinical research on BPA-based BNCT.",Excluded

2105,"Radionuclide antibody-conjugates, a targeted therapy towards cancer. Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is an investigational procedure which utilises monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), peptide conjugates and/or other chemical compounds. These bio-vectors are able to transport a dose of alpha particles to destroy cancer cells. Radionuclide antibody-conjugates (RACs), labelled with beta emitters, have already been used in humans. More recently, TAT has been introduced to treat oncological diseases mainly leukaemia and lymphoma. Encouraging results have also been obtained in solid neoplasms with the administration of anti-tenascin. This chimeric antibody labelled with astatine-211 was delivered in patients with recurrent brain tumours into a surgically created cavity. Conversely, a clinical trial using a standard TAT approach to treat patients with metastatic melanoma, observed the shrinkage of the solid tumour mass. This response in melanoma may lead to an alternative mechanism for TAT, called tumour-antivascular- alpha-therapy (TAVAT), and forms the basis of a novel approach to the treatment of cancer disease states. In this paper, we will concentrate mainly on the application of TAT using antibodies. In particular, an investigation into the major general features connected with the use of alpha emitters in cancer therapy will be discussed. The prospective role of TAT with RACs will also be outlined briefly, especially focussing on the most important therapeutic strategies to date based on antibodies radiolabelled with beta emitters.",Excluded
1496,"SPECT image segmentation for estimation of tumour volume and activity concentration in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE radionuclide therapy. Background: Dosimetry in radionuclide therapy has the potential to allow for a treatment tailored to the individual patient. One therapeutic radiopharmaceutical where patient-specific dosimetry is feasible is <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE, used for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours. The emission of gamma photons by <sup>177</sup>Lu allows for imaging with SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). One important step for dosimetry using this imaging technique is the SPECT image segmentation, which needs to be robust and accurate for the estimated quantities to be reliable. This work investigates different methods for automatic tumour delineation in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE SPECT images. Three segmentation methods are considered: a fixed 42% threshold (FT), the Otsu method (OM) and a method based on Fourier surfaces (FS). Effects of including resolution compensation in the iterative SPECT image reconstruction are also studied. Evaluation is performed based on Monte Carlo-simulated SPECT images from 24 h and 336 h post injection (p.i.), for determination of the volume, activity concentration and dice similarity coefficient. In addition, patient data are used to investigate the correspondence of tumour volumes when delineated in SPECT or morphological CT or MR images. Patient data are also used to examine the sensitivity to the operator-dependent initialization. Result(s): For simulated images from 24 h p.i. reconstructed without resolution compensation, a volume and activity-concentration root-mean-square error below 15% is typically obtained for tumours above approximately 10 cm<sup>3</sup> when using OM or FS, while FT performs considerably worse. When including resolution compensation, the tumour volume becomes underestimated and the activity concentration overestimated. The FS method appears to be robust to noise, as seen for the 336 h images. The differences between the tumour volumes estimated from the SPECT images and the volumes estimated from morphological images are generally larger than the discrepancies seen for the simulated data sets. Conclusion(s): Segmentation results are encouraging for future dosimetry of tumours with volumes above approximately 10 cm<sup>3</sup>. Using resolution compensation in the reconstruction may have a negative effect on volume estimation. Copyright © 2017, The Author(s).",Excluded

Introduction: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has been used to treat cavernous malformations (CMs) located in basal ganglia and thalamus. However, previous reports are limited by small patient population. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological data of 53 patients with CMs of basal ganglia and thalamus who underwent GKRS at West China Hospital between May 2009 and July 2018. All patients suffered at least once bleeding before GKRS. The mean volume of these lesions was 1.77 cm, and the mean marginal dose was 13.2 Gy. After treatment, patients were followed to determine the change in symptom and hemorrhage event. Result(s): The mean follow-up period was 52.1 months (6.2-104.3 months). The calculated annual hemorrhage rate (AHR) was 48.5% prior to GKRS and 3.0% after treatment (p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 2-, 3-, and 5-year hemorrhage-free survival were 88, 80.9, and 80.9%, respectively. Preexisting symptoms were resolved in 11 patients, improved in 14, and stable in 5. Only 2 patients (3.8%) developed new neurological deficit. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that AHR after GKRS was comparable to the recorded AHR of natural history (3.1-4.1%) in previous studies. GKRS is a safe and effective treatment modality for CMs of basal ganglia and thalamus. Considering the relative insufficient understanding of natural history of CMs, future study warrants longer follow-up. © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.",Excluded

1959,"Effectiveness of lead cap in radiation protection of head in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. Aims: Occupational head exposure of radiation was suggested to be associated with brain tumors in interventional cardiologists. The brain is of particular interest, because it is one of the least protected organs during interventional procedures. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the lead cap in radiation protection of the head and compare it with that of a ceiling mounted lead glass screen in a real life setting. Our secondary goal was to test the comfort and convenience of the lead cap when worn on a regular daily basis. Methods and Results: Radiation dose to the operator was recorded by the three dosimeters placed outside the lead cap, inside the cap and outside the apron at the level of trunk for a total of 18 months. Only the lead cap (Burkhart Roentgen International, St Petersburg, Florida, USA) but not the ceiling suspended protective glass screen was used during the first three months of measurement of radiation dose to the head. Later concomitant use of both protection devices was analysed. The dosimeter outside the cap recorded a dose of 2.77 mSv radiation when the ceiling mounted screen was not used during the first 3 months. The doses were 2.4 to 12.5 times higher in comparison to the measurements that were recorded when the ceiling suspended screen was used. However, a remarkable dose of radiation (ranged between 1.16-0.22 mSv) was received by the operators head despite the use of ceiling mounted screen. Yet, even without the protection of the ceiling mounted screen, the dose recorded by the dosimeter inside the lead cap during the first period was <0.1 mSv. As expected, the doses to the head recorded by the dosimeter inside the cap during the next 15 months period were also less than 0.1 mSv with the use of the ceiling mounted screen. Therefore, a cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless of the use of the screen. Conclusion(s): A cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence was much more protective than the mounted screen and reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless the use of the mounted screen. Although being a subjective conclusion, the operator regularly wearing the lead cap reported that the lead cap is reasonably comfortable and offers an acceptable wearing comfort when used on daily practice.",Excluded

Chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are the most common, intractable and unpleasant side effects in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists plus dexamethasone have significantly improved the control of acute nausea and vomiting, but delayed nausea and vomiting remains a significant clinical problem. Combined neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists with 5-HT3 antagonists and steroids are observed to be better in the control of both acute and delayed emesis. However, the use of these antiemetics is observed to possess inherent side effects.

1492,"Changes in the vestibular function during space flight. An analysis of observations and investigations carried out in space flight has shown that some cosmonauts and astronauts have experienced vestibular disorders during the transition to weightlessness. Vestibular-sensory disorders include: Spatial illusions (the feelings of falling down, being in an upside-down position, the sensations of rotation of the craft or the body) and vertigo occurring during the onset of the orbital flight and head movements; Feelings, similar to those experienced in response to Coriolis accelerations on the Earth, which occasionally develop in weightlessness during the spacecraft rotation upon abrupt head and body movements and restrained feet; Feelings ""of the load on the vestibular analyser which is unlike any Earth-bound effects"" upon abrupt head movements during the first hours of an orbital flight and ""a prolonged movement"" during the switch-off of thrusters in weightlessness. Vestibular-vegetative disorders comprise a complex of symptoms similar to those of motion sickness: loss of appetite, stomach awareness (12%), hypersalination, nausea (9.6%) and vomiting (4.8%). Soviet studies suggest that the vestibular tolerance to the flight effects depends on the natural stability and training to the cumulative effect of adequate vestibular stimuli. This has been used in the development of the system of vestibular selection. Changes in the vestibular function seem to play the major role in the development of motion sickness in weightlessness, extra-labyrinthine factors being contributory. The current hypotheses have not yet been adequately confirmed in experiments. A detailed physiological analysis allows the conclusion that the decisive factor in the development of motion sickness may be the disturbance of the function of analysers responsible for spatial orientation which take the form of sensory conflicts as well as an altered reactivity of the organism due to the hemodynamic rearrangement.

Thoracic radiotherapy has been shown in to increase overall survival when added to systemic therapy in patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and M0 stage. The dose, fractionation, treatment time and timing issues have not been fully resolved. A recent study did not show the superiority of 66Gy in 33 daily fractions over 6.5 weeks over twice-daily radiotherapy to a dose of 45 Gy in 30 fractions over 3 weeks twice daily [1]. For stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has been clearly shown to be superior to conventional fractionation [2]. Given the clear benefit seen in early stage NSCLC, it is postulated that SABR may have a role to play in early stage SCLC. A recent multi-institutional cohort study has reported favourable outcomes in this setting [3]. However, randomised data of equivalence or indeed superiority are lacking. Furthermore, questions remain as the timing and role of systemic therapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation when SABR is used in this setting. In advanced SCLC, many tumors display neuroendocrine clinical and cytological features and many SCLC tumors express somatostatin receptor and this can be imaged using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs such as <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE [4]. Given the uptake by some SCLC tumors of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE, higher doses of the tracer have been used in an attempt to provide radiolabelled radiotherapy treatment in metastatic disease in what has been described as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) [5]. This molecularly target radiotherapy is a potentially exciting therapeutic approach, but the ideal positioning of such therapy in tumors which are suitable for treatment with PRRT and the safety of PRRT with systemic therapy have yet to be determined.

The neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) were investigated in two rat lines selectively bred for high and low anxiety-related behavior. The stimulation parameters were adjusted according to the results of accurate computer-assisted and magnetic resonance imaging-based reconstructions of the current density distributions induced by rTMS in the rat and human brain, ensuring comparable stimulation patterns in both cases. Adult male rats were treated in two 3-day series under halothane anesthesia. In the forced swim test, rTMS-treatment induced a more active coping strategy in the high anxiety-related behavior rats only (time spent struggling; 332% vs. controls), allowing these animals to reach the performance of low anxiety-related behavior rats. In contrast, rTMS-treated low anxiety-related behavior rats did not change their swimming behavior. The development of active coping strategies in high anxiety-related behavior rats was accompanied by a significantly attenuated stress-induced elevation of plasma corticotropin and corticosterone concentrations. In summary, the behavioral and neuroendocrine effects of rTMS of frontal brain regions in high anxiety-related behavior rats are comparable to the effects of antidepressant drug treatment. Interestingly, in the psychopathological animal model repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induced changes in stress coping abilities in the high-anxiety line only.",Excluded

Stimuli that modulate neuronal activity are not always detectable, indicating a loss of information between the modulated neurons and perception. To identify where in the macaque visual system information about periodic light modulations is lost, signal-to-noise ratios were compared across simulated cone photoreceptors, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons, and perceptual judgements. Stimuli were drifting, threshold-contrast Gabor patterns on a photopic background. The sensitivity of LGN neurons, extrapolated to populations, was similar to the monkeys' at low temporal frequencies. At high temporal frequencies, LGN sensitivity exceeded the monkeys' and approached the upper bound set by cone photocurrents. These results confirm a loss of high-frequency information downstream of the LGN. However, this loss accounted for only about 5% of the total. Phototransduction accounted for essentially all of the rest. Together, these results show that low temporal frequency information is lost primarily between the cones and the LGN, whereas high-frequency information is lost primarily within the cones, with a small additional loss downstream of the LGN.",Excluded

We report our experience with radiosurgery for tumor control and the complications of unilateral vestibular schwannomas. Method(s): We reviewed our early experience regarding clinical presentation, management and outcomes in 45 patients with acoustic schwannomas who underwent gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery. The median follow-up period was 25 months (range, 6-48 months). Thirteen patients had undergone 1 or more previous resections before radiosurgery; 32 underwent radiosurgery as the first procedure. Median tumor volume was 4.5 mL (range, 0.5-30.0), and median radiotherapy dose was 11.5 Gy (range, 10.5-14.0 Gy). Result(s): Tumor control was achieved in 43 patients (95.6%).

Introduction: Detailed prospective studies are scarce on gamma knife treatment for arteriovenous malformations (AVM) or cavernous angioma (CA) regarding epilepsy outcome. The objective of this study is to further investigate prospectively the effect of gamma knife on seizures and expand our knowledge to other aspects of epilepsy management: medication, cognition and quality of life. Method(s): We included prospectively 9 consecutive patients (4 AVM and 5 CA) who underwent radiosurgery for epilepsy caused by vascular malformation at the CHUS between August 2004 and August 2009. The mean marginal radiation dose was 20 Gy. The objective of this study is to determinate the seizure outcome after radiosurgery. Patients were followed every 3 months to evaluate seizure count over time, Engel score and medication status. Quality of life (QOLIE 89) and neuropsychological evaluation were completed before the treatment and at 12 and 24 months following the intervention. Result(s): Patients were followed for a mean period of 39 months (range from 15 to 72 months). Three patients have been seizure free for 1 year (33%). Overall 5 patients (55%) had significant improvement with an Engel score of 1 (completely seizure free or non disabling simple partial seizure only). Medication status did not change over time. The QOLIE 89 score improved by more than 25 points (on a 100 points scale) in 3 patients (43%), 2 patients (29%) reported no change and 2 patients had lower scores. Neuropsychological testing did not show any deterioration in cognition following the intervention. No adverse reaction occurred so far. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery has some efficacy for the treatment of epilepsy associated with vascular malformations and improves quality of life in a majority of patients. It seems less effective than surgical lesionectomy. No cognitive or physical morbidity was observed.

Objectives To determine dosimetry of a novel vesicular acetylcholine transporter [<sup>18</sup>F]VAT based on PET scans in nonhuman primates with potential for investigation of neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Methods We collected transmission scans to cover four body sections: A (eyes and whole brain), B (heart and lungs), C (liver, gallbladder and kidneys), and D (urinary bladder, small and large intestines) in two male and a female macaque fascicularis. This was followed by 4 hour long sequential whole-body scan immediately after injection of 5.01-5.36 mCi [<sup>18</sup>F]VAT tracer. Arterial blood samples were obtained in the female animal over a total scanning time. Time activity curves (TAC) were created from regions of Interest (ROIs) that encompassed entire small organs or samples with highest activity within large organs. Organ residence times were calculated based on TAC. We then entered the organ residence times in OLINDA/EXM to calculate human radiation dose estimates. Results The blood time activity resulted in a residence time 0.30 hr in agreement with the residence time calculated based on the time activity curve measured in the left ventricle by PET 0.39 hr.

1370,"Parietal rTMS disrupts the initiation but not the execution of on-line adjustments to a perturbation of object size. Previous studies have implicated the human parietal lobes in the on-line guidance of action. However, no study to date has examined at what stage in the on-line adjustment process do the parietal lobes play their most critical role. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied over the left intraparietal sulcus as participants reached to grasp a small or large illuminated cylinder. On some trials, the illumination could suddenly switch from the small to large cylinder, or vice-versa. Small-Large switches were associated with relatively early grip aperture adjustments, whereas Large-Small switches were associated with relatively late grip aperture adjustments. When rTMS was applied early in the movement, it disrupted on-line adjustments to Small-Large target switches, but not to Large-Small switches. Conversely, when rTMS was applied late in the movement, it disrupted adjustments to Large-Small target switches but not to Small-Large switches. The timing of the disruption by rTMS appeared linked to the initiation of the adjustment. It was concluded that the left parietal lobe plays a critical role in initiating an on-line adjustment to a change in target size, but not in executing that adjustment. The implications of these results for current views of on-line control are discussed.",Excluded
1383,"Percutaneous cystolitholapaxy: A safe and effective alternative to open stone surgery for the management of complex bladder stones in patients with no urethral access. Objectives: Bladder stone management in patients with reconstructed bladders drained by Mitrofanoff catheterizable channels, with no urethral access, generates multiple challenges. Trans-Mitrofanoff access limits the size of endoscopic stone fragmenting devices, risking prolonged procedures, incomplete stone clearance and damage to the continent conduit. Access through previous surgical access sites risks bowel injury. This case series reports outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous cystolitholapaxy (PCCL), using ultrasound-guided access and direct track closure, thereby limiting radiation exposure and avoiding suprapubic catheters (SPCs). Patients and Methods: Seven PCCL procedures were performed in five patients with closed urethras. Average age 32 years, primary diagnoses: spina bifida, vertebrae, anus, trachea, esophagus, renal (VATER) syndrome, bladder exstrophy and traumatic brain injury. Four used Mitrofanoff stomas and one an SPC. Average largest stone was 18.57 mm (range 10-30 mm). Five procedures were for multiple stones (range 2-30 stones). Result(s): Each PCCL achieved complete stone clearance. Average operative time: 146 min (range 72-250 min). No intraoperative blood loss or bladder perforation. Postoperative median length of stay was 2 days. Conclusion(s): PCCL is a safe, minimally invasive alternative to open surgery for large and multiple bladder stones in individuals with complex lower urinary tract anatomy, specifically reconstructed bladders drained by Mitrofanoff catheterizable channels with no urethral access.

2383,"Acoustic neuroma: potential benefits of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery. BACKGROUND: Single-fraction radiosurgery of acoustic neuromas less than 3 cm in diameter is remarkable for high control but not infrequent incidence of facial and trigeminal neuropathy. Larger tumors treated surgically often result in deafness and facial neuropathy. Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery was used in an effort to maintain effective therapy while minimizing toxicity of treatment.METHODS: The authors described 38 patients with acoustic neuromas, with age range 35-89 years (mean, 60 years). 2,000 cGy in divided weekly doses of 400 or 500 cGy was most commonly prescribed. Tumors > or = 3 cm (n = 16) received the 5 fraction schema. Mean tumor volume was 6.9 cm3, with range from 0.1 to 32.0 cm3.RESULTS: Median clinical follow-up was 27.1 months, while neuroimaging follow-up had a median of 16.3 months. All tumors were controlled. Of 23 tumors smaller than 3 cm, 14 (61%) decreased in size, and 9 showed cessation of growth. Thirteen of 16 (81%) large acoustic neuromas (3-5 cm) diminished in size. The remaining 3 showed cessation of growth. Median radiographic follow-up was 20 months, with a median clinical follow-up of 28 months. No patient developed fifth nerve symptoms after treatment nor did any patient require surgery for treatment failure. Only one had temporary seventh nerve palsy.CONCLUSION: Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery offers a therapeutic approach producing high control rates while avoiding morbidity frequently seen after single-fraction radiosurgery or microsurgery.",Excluded

Goal: To explore features and cerebral basis of ""radiation"" PTSD in the Chernobyl accident survivors. Subjects and methods: The cross-sectional study included 241 people, 219 of whom have been diagnosed with PTSD according to the DSM-IV criteria, among them 115 clean-up workers [liquidators] of the Chernobyl accident (34 with acute radiation sickness), 76 evacuees from the Chernobyl exclusion zone, 28 veterans of the war in Afghanistan, and 22 healthy unexposed individuals. Psychometric examinations, neurocognitive assessments, computerized electroencephalography, and cerebral vascular Doppler were used. Result(s): ""Radiation"" PTSD includes: ""flashforward"" phenomenon and anticipating stress (projection of fear and danger to the future); somatoform disorders, depression, trait and state anxiety; neurocognitive deficit (impaired memory and attention, auditory-verbal memory and learning, proactive and retroactive interference; cerebellar and stem symptoms, intellectual changes). The intima-media component thickness of common carotid arteries, and common and left internal carotid arteries stenosis rates are increased in the liquidators. Changes of bioelectrical brain activity as a decrease of beta- and theta-power together with an increase of alpha-power were found in the Chernobyl accident survivors with PTSD. Conclusion(s): PTSD following radiation emergency is characterized by comorbidity of psychopathology, neurocognitive deficit, and cerebrovascular pathology with increased risk of cerebral atherosclerosis and stroke. Cerebral basis of this PTSD is proposed to be an abnormal communication between the pyramidal cells of neocortex and hippocampus, and deep brain structures.",Included

Barlow proposed that absolute visual threshold is limited by photon-like noise events in the rod photoreceptors, and he later extended the idea to explain the elevation of threshold following bright bleaching lights in terms of increased noise in the photoreceptors. Rushton, on the other hand, has proposed that the threshold elevation during dark adaptation involves changes not within the photoreceptors themselves but rather in the gain of a subsequent 'pool'. I report here measurements of outer segment current in individual rod photoreceptors which demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations occur at a greatly increased rate following bleaches of around 1%, and that these fluctuations have the form expected for random occurrences of the single photon events. This is consistent with Barlow's ideas but does not indicate whether a gain change subsequent to the receptors also occurs.",Excluded

The goal of this study was to find the incidence of AN in Iceland from 1979 - 2009 as well as investigate other epidemiological factors.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group of patients with the AN diagnosis was gathered retrospectively through medical records. We looked at several epidemiological factors including age and symptoms at diagnosis, and the treatment chosen for each individual.RESULTS: The incidence rate of AN in Iceland is 1.24/100,000. About 10% of diagnosed tumors were found incidentally. Most of those were found in the last 10 years of the investigation and in that period fewer large and giant tumors at diagnosis. Present complaints of patients at diagnosis were hearing loss (69%), dysequilibrium/dizziness (47%) and tinnitus (43%). Treatments were surgery (n=47), observation (n=30) and gamma knife radiosurgery (n=16). We had information concerning postoperative hearing loss and facial paralysis in 39 patients who underwent surgery. Loss of hearing postoperatively occurred in 69% (n=27) and 44% (n=17) had facial paralysis. For an average of 3.5 years, 17% of tumors followed by imaging grew.CONCLUSION: The incidence of AN is similar to that in Europe and is increasing. More tumors are found incidentally. Small tumors can be followed by regular imaging, at least for the short term. Larger tumors are treated by surgery or gamma knife radiosurgery. A high percentage of patients receiving surgery lost their hearing postoperatively.",Included

1430,"Immunotherapy of diffuse gliomas: biological background, current status and future developments. Despite aggressive multimodal treatment approaches, the prognosis for patients with diffuse gliomas remains disappointing. Glioma cells often extensively infiltrate in the surrounding brain parenchyma, a phenomenon that helps them to escape surgical removal, radiation exposure and chemotherapy. Moreover, conventional therapy is often associated with considerable local and systemic side effects. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic approaches is essential to improve the outcome of these patients. Immunotherapy offers the opportunity to specifically target residual radio-and chemoresistant tumor cells without damaging healthy neighboring brain tissue. Significant progress has been made in recent years both in understanding the mechanisms of immune regulation in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as tumor-induced and host-mediated immunosuppression elicited by gliomas. In this review, after discussing the special requirements needed for the initiation and control of immune responses in the CNS, we focus on immunological phenomena observed in glioma patients, discuss different immunological approaches to attack glioma-associated target structures and touch on further strategies to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy of gliomas.

1685,"Boron Neutron Capture Therapy in the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme: The First Experiences in the Czech Republic. [Slovak]. Background. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, its treatment remains unsatisfactory with very limited overall survival. In the year 2001, in cooperation with Department of Neurosurgery, Nemocnice Na Homolce and Nuclear Research Institute in Rez, we have started to treat glioblastoma patients with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Methods and Results. Cells of malignant brain tumors, especially that of glioblastomas, are able to accumulate boron compounds. If BNCT should be successful, it is necessary to reach selective accumulation of sufficient amount of 10B in the tumor and low accumulation in the normal brain tissue. After BSH administration, radiation with low energy thermal neutrons is delivered. It results in nuclear capture and fission reactions with subsequent selective damage of tumor cells. At the time of analysis 9 patients have been enrolled. Therapy was completed in 5 patients. Treatment has been very well tolerated. We observed minimal acute toxicity associated with radiation and no laboratory abnormalities after administrations of BSH. Unfortunately treatment results were quite unsatisfactory. The median time to progression and overall survival were shorter then expected with conventional treatment. Conclusions. BNCT is very well tolerated with only a modest toxicity. In contrast to standard radiation, BNCT patients receive only one dose of radiation. Nevertheless, in this small pilot study first results were inferior when compared either to outcomes of conventional therapy or to results reported from other BNCT groups. It might be explained that lower dose of radiation had been used. Further study will show whether the higher dose radiation can improve treatment results.",Excluded
1731,"New forms of radionuclide therapy with <sup>90</sup>Y in oncology. Background: Currently, there is growing interest in the use of the beta emitter <sup>90</sup>Y in systemic therapy in oncology. For successful therapy, an appropriate ligand is chosen to carry the isotope to the place of its action. As well as performing this function, the type of the ligand influences both the course and the side effects of the treatment. For RIT of lymphomas, bone marrow becomes the critical organ; in NET patients treated with labelled somatostatin analogues, increased kidney irradiation can occur. The aim of this study was to evaluate the side effects of therapy using <sup>90</sup>Y associated with different ligands, depending on the charge to critical organs after treatment in two groups of patients: those with neuroendocrine tumours and those with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Material(s) and Method(s): 32 patients with histopathologically confirmed NET treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq/m<sup>2</sup> cumulative dose) and 30 NHL patients treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (1200 MBq max dose) were enrolled in the study. The kidney function and changes of blood indices were assessed during the course of the therapy. Result(s): 59% of NET patients treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE displayed transient reduction of blood indices, the largest after cycles III and IV of therapy. After 5 months an increase in creatinine level was noticed, but no statistically important changes in creatinine level and GFR were observed. In the group of patients with NHL, the change of haematological indices after RIT concerned mainly PLT, ANC and WBC. The reduction of the average PLT and WBC values started in the first weeks after the treatment application, reaching nadir in the 6th week and 8th week, respectively.

1582,"Classifying the risk of ionizing radiation exposure after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Learning Objectives: We hypothesized that patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) could be classified by their risk of receiving potentially harmful ionizing radiation exposure (PHIRE) from diagnostic tests and medical procedures. Method(s): The EMR of all patients admitted to our institution with aSAH from 01/2012-12/2015 were retrospectively evaluated using an IRB-approved protocol for patient-specific and disease-specific data. Patients were excluded if they died prior to discharge. Total effective dose of ionizing radiation (TEDIR) was calculated from published data. PHIRE was considered to have occurred in patients with TEDIR> 50 mSV, the annual radiation exposure limit for radiation workers. A multivariate classification tree was created to predict PHIRE risk groups. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk of PHIRE between the risk groups. Result(s): Data were collected from 108 aSAH patients. The mean TEDIR was 47.8 mSv. After development of the multivariate classification tree, the tree was pruned to include only ventriculostomy (EVD), Hunt/Hess score (HH), and aneurysm location, according to normal statistical conventions. Patients who did not have an ventriculostomy (EVD) were at low risk for PHIRE (N = 2/35, (5.7%)). Patients with an EVD + HH 2 + anterior circulation aneurysms were at moderate risk for PHIRE (N = 17/42, 40.5%). (OR = 11.2, p = 0.002). Patients with an EVD + HH < 2 or EVD + HH 2 + posterior circulation aneurysms were at high risk for PHIRE (N = 23/31, 74.2%) (OR = 47.4, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In this study, aSAH patients were categorized into low, moderate and high risk groups of PHIRE according to three factors: EVD, HH, and aneurysm location. These groups likely represent differential baseline neurologic status and risk of neurologic complications. Alternative diagnostic or therapeutic modalities should be utilized, when possible, for patients in the high-risk group and should be considered for patients in the moderate-risk group.

PURPOSE: To investigate the risk of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in patients with head-and-neck cancer and treated with radiation therapy (RT) or concomitant cisplatin-based chemoradiation, the relationship among SNHL and radiation dose to the cochlea, the use of two common cisplatin dose regimens.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 62 head-and-neck cancer patients treated with curative intent were included in this prospective study. Of the patients, 21 received RT alone, 27 received 40 mg/m(2) weekly cisplatin, 13 received 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks during RT, and 1 received RT with weekly epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor antibody. The effect of chemotherapy and RT dose on hearing was determined using a model that accounted for the age and variability between each ear for each patient.RESULTS: We constructed a model to predict dose-dependent hearing loss for RT or cisplatin-based chemotherapy either alone or in combination. For patients only receiving RT, no significant hearing loss was found at doses to the cochlea of less than 40 Gy. Patients receiving 100 mg/m(2) or 40 mg/m(2) of cisplatin chemotherapy had an estimated +21.5 dB and +9.5 dB hearing loss at 8,000 Hz with low radiation doses (10 Gy), which rose to +38.4 dB and +18.9 dB for high radiation doses (40 Gy).CONCLUSIONS: Use of RT alone with doses of less than 40 Gy did not result in clinically significant hearing loss. High-frequency SNHL was profoundly damaged in patients who received concomitant cisplatin when doses of 100 mg/m(2) were used. The threshold cochlear dose for hearing loss with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and RT was predicted to be 10 Gy. The inner ear radiation dose constraints and cisplatin dose intensity should be considered in the treatment of advanced head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded

1284,"Monitoring radiation treatment effects in glioblastoma: Are changes in flair volume prognostic?. Purpose/Objective(s): Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity is believed to represent microscopic infiltration of tumor in glioblastoma (GBM), but is also affected by post-treatment changes. Numerous studies have evaluated the relationship between FLAIR volume and clinical outcomes, but results have been mixed. We sought to develop an objective measure of FLAIR volume that was independent of user input and not influenced by digital contrast adjustment. Using this automated method of image analysis, we evaluated the relationship between pre-radiation FLAIR volume and post-radiation changes in FLAIR volume in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed FLAIR imaging data from 56 consecutive GBM patients treated at a single institution between January 2012 and December 2013. An increase in FLAIR signal was defined as voxels 2 standard deviations above the median intensity value across the entire brain-extracted volume. This automated process was performed on the post-resection, pre-radiation MRI scan as well as all available post-radiation FLAIR sequences. The volume of voxels reaching this threshold was computed for all sequences. All patient charts were reviewed to compute the PFS, which was defined as any radiographic or clinical progression leading to a recommendation to change or stop treatment. Result(s): Of 56 patients, 24 (43%) were female and the median age was 60.5 years (range 16 e 85). Our analysis failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between the initial FLAIR volume and overall survival or clinically defined PFS. The change in FLAIR volume after radiation therapy as a function of time was also not related to these clinical outcome measures. The lack of a significant association between these measures was also true when using a more stringent threshold of FLAIR hyperintensity (5 standard deviations above the mean). Conclusion(s): With the assumption that FLAIR signal represents inflammatory edema caused by tumor infiltration into otherwise healthy tissue, many studies have attempted to correlate FLAIR volume with OS and PFS in the post-treatment setting. Results of these studies have varied, and the prognostic value of FLAIR volume has yet to be clearly demonstrated in glioblastoma. Using an automated and objective volumetric measure, we found no significant correlation between clinical outcomes and changes in FLAIR volume, a measure that is often used in routine MRI surveillance in the post-treatment setting. Our results suggest that gross edema volumes cannot directly predict PFS or OS.",Excluded
1348,"Enhancement of dosimetric optimization for stereotactic radiosurgery. [French]. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a technique for treatment of intracranial lesions requiring high precision in all steps - from image acquisition to final irradiation. One of most difficult steps is the treatment planning phase, consisting of determination of irradiation parameters sufficient to cover the target volume by avoiding sensitive volumes. A manual and empirical definition can be very long and difficult, especially in the case of complex target volumes situated in sensitive zones. As in conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery has taken advantages from dosimetric optimization. The question is: 'What is the configuration of irradiation parameters used in order to obtain the treatment plan by satisfying defined constraints?'. The purpose of this article is to summarize optimization methods used in radiosurgery and to describe the technical alternatives proposed for this treatment as well as the possibilities of plan evaluation between different techniques. This purpose will be illustrated by the optimization methodology used in the Center Oscar Lambret of Lille, France for the radiosurgical treatment with linear accelerator.",Excluded

Since 1990, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) has been used for over 400 cancer patients at the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURRI). After BNCT, the patients are radioactive and their (24)Na and (38)Cl levels can be detected via a Na-I scintillation counter. This activity is predominantly due to (24)Na, which has a half-life of 14.96 h and thus remains in the body for extended time periods. Radioactive (24)Na is mainly generated from (23)Na in the target tissue that is exposed to the neutron beam in BNCT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the radioactivity of blood (24)Na following BNCT and the absorbed gamma ray dose in the irradiated field. To assess blood (24)Na, 1 ml of peripheral blood was collected from 30 patients immediately after the exposure, and the radioactivity of blood (24)Na was determined using a germanium counter. The activity of (24)Na in the blood correlated with the absorbed gamma ray doses in the irradiated field. For the same absorbed gamma ray dose in the irradiated field, the activity of blood (24)Na was higher in patients with neck or lung tumors than in patients with brain or skin tumors. The reasons for these findings are not readily apparent, but the difference in the blood volume and the ratio of bone to soft tissue in the irradiated field, as well as the dose that leaked through the clinical collimator, may be responsible.",Excluded
1643,"Thyroid follicular cell carcinogenesis. Ample information in experimental animals indicates a relationship between inhibition of thyroid-pituitary homeostasis and the developmental thyroid follicular cell neoplasms. This is generally the case when there are long-term reductions in circulating thyroid hormones which have triggered increases in circulating thyroid stimulating hormone. Such hormonal derangements leading to neoplasms have been produced by different regimens, including dietary iodide deficiency, subtotal thyroidectomy, and administration of natural and xenobiotic chemical substances. The carcinogenic process proceeds through a number of stages, including follicular cell hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and benign and sometimes malignant neoplasms. Given the interrelationship between the thyroid and pituitary glands, conditions that result in stimulation of the thyroid can also result in stimulation of the pituitary, with the development of hyperplastic and neoplastic changes. The progression of events leading to thyroid (and pituitary) neoplasms can be reversed under certain circumstances be reestablishing thyroid-pituitary homeostasis. Most chemicals that have induced follicular cell tumors seem to operate through inhibition of the synthesis of thyroid hormone or an increase in their degradation and removal. For some of these compounds, it appears that genotoxic reactions may not be playing a dominant role in the carcinogenic process. A seemingly small group of thyroid carcinogens seems to lack influence on thyroid-pituitary status and may in part be operating via their genotoxic potential. In contrast with the well-established relationship between thyroid-pituitary derangement and follicular cell neoplasms in animals, the state of information in humans is much less certain. At this time, ionizing radiation is the only acknowledged human thyroid carcinogen, a finding well established in experimental systems as well. Although humans respond to goitrogenic stimuli as do animals, with the development of cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and under certain circumstances nodular lesions, disagreement exists as to whether malignant transformation occurs in any predictable manner. It would seem that if humans develop thyroid tumors following long-term derangement in thyroid-pituitary status, they may be less sensitive than the commonly used animal models.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to reduce exposure of the contralateral hippocampus in radiotherapy for glioblastoma using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).METHODS: Datasets of 27 patients who had received 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for glioblastoma with a prescribed dose of 60Gy in fractions of 2Gy were included in this planning study. VMAT plans were optimized with the aim to reduce the dose to the contralateral hippocampus as much as possible without compromising other parameters. Hippocampal dose and treatment parameters were compared to the 3D-CRT plans using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The influence of tumour location and PTV size on the hippocampal dose was investigated with the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.RESULTS: The median reduction of the contralateral hippocampus generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) with VMAT was 36 % compared to the original 3D-CRT plans (p < 0.05). Other dose parameters were maintained or improved. The median V30Gy brain could be reduced by 17.9 % (p < 0.05). For VMAT, a parietal and a non-temporal tumour localisation as well as a larger PTV size were predictors for a higher hippocampal dose (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Using VMAT, a substantial reduction of the radiotherapy dose to the contralateral hippocampus for patients with glioblastoma is feasible without compromising other treatment parameters. For larger PTV sizes, less sparing can be achieved. Whether this approach is able to preserve the neurocognitive status without compromising the oncological outcome needs to be investigated in the setting of prospective clinical trials.",Excluded

Studies of the in vivo multiplication of an attenuated temperature-sensitive strain of vaccinia virus (ts2) indicated that temperature sensitivity alone could not account for the attenuation. Immunodepressive treatment of intracerebrally inoculated mice had a dramatic stimulatory effect on the multiplication of the attenuated strain and suggested that establishment of ts2 infection in the mice was hindered by host defense mechanisms mediated by cellular elements. Experiments carried out in vitro with the 51Cr release assay showed that cells infected with the ts2 mutant represented more susceptible targets to the cytotoxic action of immune spleen cells than cells infected with the parent vaccinia strain. Moreover, it appeared that ts2 replication, compared with wild-type replication in vitro, was more inhibited by the immune spleen cells. Although this work did not evaluate the role of specifically sensitized lymphocytes within the lesions, indirect evidence suggests that lymphocytes could cause a more effective halt in ts2 virus multiplication than in wild-type multiplication.",Excluded

Osteoid osteoma (OO) of the cervical spine is frequently located close to the vertebral artery, spinal cord, or nerve roots and complete surgical excision is sometimes difficult by a limited approach and more extended surgery can require spinal fusion. Percutaneous radiofrequency coagulation (PRC) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of OO of the pelvis and limbs however, its role in the cervical spine is still nuclear. The Authors present a series of nine cases of OO of the cervical spine, six treated with surgical excision and three with PRC. No neurological or vascular complications occurred in both series. One case of the surgical series had only partial relief of persistent pain for 1 year due to incomplete excision, but is doing well 4 years after surgery. All the other surgical cases had complete relief of symptoms immediately after surgery and are symptom-free 3-10 years later. Two cases of PRC had complete relief of symptoms 24-48 h after surgery and are symptom-free 2 and 3 years later. One case of recurrent OO after surgery and treated with PRC with a reduced dose improved only, and still requires anti-inflammatory drugs 2 years after the procedure. Our still limited experience suggests that PRC can be safely performed in local anaesthesia with the patient awake, enabling to check for signs and symptoms of possible neurological injury.

D609 (tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate) is a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C inhibitor that also has been reported to protect rodents against oxidative damage caused by lethal doses of ionizing radiation. We previously showed that D609 mimics glutathione. D609 has a free thiol group, which upon oxidation forms a disulfide. The resulting dixanthate is a substrate for glutathione reductase, regenerating D609. Recent studies from our laboratory have also shown that D609 reduces the Alzheimer amyloid beta-peptide (1-42)-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in neuronal cell culture. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that D609 would provide neuroprotection against free radical oxidative stress in vivo.

Relatively thick slices of 5-10 mm make the detection of microadenomas very difficult, mainly because of partial volume effects. T1 and T2 values alone are not sufficient to provide specific diagnosis. No reliable criteria have been determined yet, which would indicate the quality of pathological involvement of peritumorous structures by tumours of the sella region. At present NMR still plays a more complementary role to CT in the evaluation of this complex anatomical area. We are confident that with future technical refinements NMR will be able to replace ionizing radiation for the diagnostic imaging of the sella.",Excluded
2304,"Clinical Characteristics and Associated Systemic Diseases in Patients with Esophageal ""absent Contractility"" - A Clinical Algorithm. Goals: This study was carried out to assess the clinical characteristics and associated systemic diseases seen in patients diagnosed with absent contractility as per the Chicago Classification version 3.0, allowing us to propose a diagnostic algorithm for their etiologic testing. Background(s): The Chicago Classification version 3.0 has redefined major and minor esophageal motility disorders using high-resolution esophageal manometry. There is a dearth of publications based on research on absent contractility, which historically has been associated with myopathic processes such as systemic sclerosis (SSc). Study: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study. Data of patients diagnosed with absent contractility were pooled from Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH (January 2006 to July 2016) and Metrohealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH (July 2014 to July 2016) and included: age, gender, associated medical conditions, surgical history, medications, and specific antibody testing. Result(s): A total of 207 patients, including 57 male individuals and 150 female individuals, with mean age of 56.1 and 60.0 years, respectively, were included. Disease distribution was as follows: SSc (diffuse or limited cutaneous) 132, overlap syndromes 7, systemic lupus erythematosus17, Sjogren syndrome 4, polymyositis 3, and dermatomyositis 3. Various other etiologies including gastroesophageal reflux disease, postradiation esophagitis, neuromuscular disorders, and surgical complications were seen in the remaining cohort. Conclusion(s): Most practitioners use the term ""absent contractility"" interchangeably with ""scleroderma esophagus""; however, only 63% of patients with absent contractility had SSc. Overall, 20% had another systemic autoimmune rheumatologic disease and 16% had a nonrheumatologic etiology for absent contractility. Therefore, alternate diagnosis must be sought in these patients. We propose an algorithm for their etiologic evaluation. Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1748,"Purkinje-cell-restricted restoration of Kv3.3 function restores complex spikes and rescues motor coordination in Kcnc3 mutants. The fast-activating/deactivating voltage-gated potassium channel Kv3.3 (Kcnc3) is expressed in various neuronal cell types involved in motor function, including cerebellar Purkinje cells. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13) patients carrying dominant-negative mutations in Kcnc3 and Kcnc3-null mutant mice both display motor incoordination, suggested in mice by increased lateral deviation while ambulating and slips on a narrow beam. Motor skill learning, however, is spared. Mice lacking Kcnc3 also exhibit muscle twitches. In addition to broadened spikes, recordings of Kcnc3-null Purkinje cells revealed fewer spikelets in complex spikes and a lower intraburst frequency. Targeted reexpression of Kv3.3 channels exclusively in Purkinje cells in Kcnc3-null mice as well as in mice also heterozygous for Kv3.1 sufficed to restore simple spike brevity along with normal complex spikes and to rescue specifically coordination. Therefore, spike parameters requiring Kv3.3 function in Purkinje cells are involved in the ataxic null phenotype and motor coordination, but not motor learning.",Excluded

1371,"Static magnetic field effect on the arterial baroreflex-mediated control of microcirculation: implications for cardiovascular effects due to environmental magnetic fields. Increasing evidence suggests that time-varying and static magnetic fields in the environment might affect the cardiovascular system. To explore the underlying physiology, the effect of static magnetic fields (SMFs) on the carotid baroreflex control of microcirculation was studied. Twenty-four hemodynamic monitorings were performed in rabbits sedated by pentobarbital infusion (5 mg/kg/h) during experiments that lasted 120 min. Mean femoral artery blood pressure, heart rate, and ear lobe skin microcirculatory blood flow, measured by microphotoelectric plethysmogram (MPPG), were simultaneously recorded before and after a 40 min exposure of the sinocarotid baroreceptors to Nd(2)-Fe(14)-B alloy magnets (n = 14) or sham magnets (n = 10, control series). The local SMF field was 350 mT, at the baroreceptors' site. Arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was estimated from heart rate/blood pressure response to intravenous bolus injections of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. A significant positive correlation was found between the SMF-induced increase in BRS (DeltaBRS = BRS(afterSMF) - BRS(priorSMF)) and the increment in microvascular blood flow (DeltaMPPG = MPPG(afterSMF) - MPPG(priorSMF)) (r = 0.66, p < 0.009). The SMF probably modulated the arterial baroreflex-mediated microcirculatory control. This could represent one possible mechanism how environmental magnetic fields act on the cardiovascular system, and a method how to complexly adjust macro- and microcirculation with potential clinical implementation.",Excluded

AC chemotherapy (3 months) followed by paditaxel plus bevacizumab (4 months) was administered as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, she underwent mastectomy and lymph node dissection. Pathological examination revealed a partial response. After surgery, radiotherapy with a radiation dose of 50 Gy was applied to the chest wall and supraclavicular lymph node. Multiple pulmonary metastases and mediastinal lymph node metastases were diagnosed 23 months after initial treatment, and she was treated with S-1 administration. Two months after S-1 treatment, the PET-CT showed metastasis in the right atrium. Since there were no cardiac symptoms, S-1 treatment was continued without cardiovascular treatment. However, the mediastinal lymph node metastasis progressed; and therefore, S-1 administration was stopped and chemotherapy with eribulin was initiated. Brain metastasis was diagnosed at the same time and treated with a gamma knife. Although chemotherapy with eribulin was continued, the patient died 33 months after initial treatment owing to the brain metastasis. The cardiac metastasis did not progress during chemotherapy with eribulin. There was no sign of heart failure or arrhythmia during the treatment.

Objectives The loss of cholinergic neurons correlates with the severity of cognitive dysfunction in dementias, including AD and PD and other CNS disorders. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) is a reliable biomarker for cholinergic neurons. Compound (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT possesses high binding potency and selectivity towards VAChT (K<inf>i-VAChT</inf> = 0.59 nM, K<inf>i-sigma1, sigma2</inf> > 10,000 nM). Here we report the radiosynthesis and in vivo evaluation of (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT in rodent and nonhuman primates. Methods (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT was synthesized by a two-step alkylation of the phenol precursor. Biodistribution studies were performed in male SD rats at 5, 30, 60, and 120 min post injection. MicroPET studies were performed in male cynomolgus monkeys (4-6 Kg) using a microPET Focus 220 scanner. Dosimetry studies were performed in one female and two male monkeys. Results (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT was synthesized in high specific activity (>2 Ci/mumol, EOB) and a yield of 30-45% (decay corrected). Biodistribution studies revealed that (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT specifically accumulates in VAChT-enriched striatum area: at 60 min, the uptake(s) (ID%/g) in striatum, cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum are 0.82, 0.43, 0.42, 0.45 and 0.29 repectively. No significant defluorination was observed. The uptake in striatum versus cerebellum reached 2.8-fold at 60 min post-injection. MicroPET brain imaging studies in nonhuman primates revealed that the striatum has the highest uptake and displayed clear striatum-to-cerebellum contrast (2.6-fold ratio). Dosimetry studies suggested that injection of 20 mCi into humans will not exceed allowable radiation exposure. Conclusions (-)-[18F]VAT is a promising PET tracer for quantifying the expression of VAChT in the brain of animals.

1773,"Chemical stimulation of rat retinal neurons: feasibility of an epiretinal neurotransmitter-based prosthesis. OBJECTIVE: No cure currently exists for photoreceptor degenerative diseases, which cause partial or total blindness in millions of people worldwide. Electrical retinal prostheses have been developed by several groups with the goal of restoring vision lost to these diseases, but electrical stimulation has limitations. It excites both somas and axons, activating retinal pathways nonphysiologically, and limits spatial resolution because of current spread. Chemical stimulation of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) using the neurotransmitter glutamate has been suggested as an alternative to electrical stimulation with some significant advantages. However, sufficient scientific data to support developing a chemical-based retinal prosthesis is lacking. The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a neurotransmitter-based retinal prosthesis and determine therapeutic stimulation parameters.APPROACH: We injected controlled amounts of glutamate into rat retinas from the epiretinal side ex vivo via micropipettes using a pressure injection system and recorded RGC responses with a multielectrode array. Responsive units were identified using a spike rate threshold of 3 Hz.MAIN RESULTS: We recorded both somal and axonal units and demonstrated successful glutamatergic stimulation across different RGC subtypes. Analyses show that exogenous glutamate acts on RGC synapses similar to endogenous glutamate and, unlike electrical prostheses, stimulates only RGC somata. The spatial spread of glutamate stimulation was = 290 mum from the injection site, comparable to current electrical prostheses. Further, the glutamate injections produced spatially differential responses in OFF, ON, and ON-OFF RGC subtypes, suggesting that differential stimulation of the OFF and ON systems may be possible. A temporal resolution of 3.2 Hz was obtained, which is a rate suitable for spatial vision.SIGNIFICANCE: We provide strong support for the feasibility of an epiretinal neurotransmitter-based retinal prosthesis. Our findings suggest that chemical stimulation of RGCs is a viable alternative to electrical stimulation and could offer distinct advantages such as the selective stimulation of RGC somata.",Excluded

2041,"Radiation as a local ablative therapy option for oligoprogressive EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with osimertinib. Purpose/Objective(s): Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved response rate and survival in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their efficacy is limited by acquired resistance and disease progression. Local ablative therapy (LAT) has shown a survival benefit in patients with oligometastatic disease in retrospective studies. At our institution, we are conducting a prospective single-arm Phase 2 study of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI. Following LAT to the sites of progression with either radiation or surgery, patients are re-initiated on osimertinib. The primary endpoints are safety, tolerability, and efficacy of re-initiation of osimertinib, as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS). We hypothesize that osimertinib and radiation can be safely administered sequentially, and that LAT followed by re-initiation of osimertinib will result in improved PFS. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with no prior EGFR-TKI exposure (cohort 1) or progression after 1st/2nd generation EGFR-TKIs with acquired T790M mutation (cohort 2) receive osimertinib. Upon progression, eligible patients with <=5 progressing sites undergo LAT by either radiation therapy or surgery, then resume osimertinib until further disease progression. Patients previously treated with osimertinib with disease progression who qualify for LAT are also eligible (cohort 3). Prior to beginning radiation, patients must be off osimertinib for at least 2 wks, and total time off osimertinib must be less than 8 wks. Result(s): Fifteen patients with a median age of 57 (range 36-71) were enrolled between 4/2016 and 1/2017 (cohorts 1/2/3: 9/3/3 patients). Overall, treatment has been well tolerated, with rash, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and alanine transaminase elevation the most common adverse events (AEs). Grade 3-4 AEs were observed in 4 (27%) patients. Objective response rates among evaluable patients prior to LAT in cohorts 1 and 2 were 71% (5/7) and 100% (2/2), respectively. Median PFS was 6.8 mo (95% CI: 3.4 mo-undefined) in cohort 1; there have been no progressions in cohort 2. To date, 2/5 patients receiving LAT have received radiation (both in cohort 3). One patient received 5 Gy x 5 to 2 lung lesions, while the other received 24 Gy and 18 Gy by stereotactic radiosurgery to 2 brain metastases. Additional endpoints include assessment of mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib by multi-omics analyses of tumor, blood, and saliva; results from these analyses will also be presented. Conclusion(s): Oligoprogressive disease can be safely treated with LAT, including radiation therapy, in patients with limited metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC after EGFR-TKI therapy. This approach could potentially prevent premature switching to other, less-effective systemic therapies by maximizing the duration and efficacy of EGFR-TKI treatment in selected patients.",Excluded

1323,"Neuroendocrine asymmetry. The information available at present clearly indicates that asymmetry exists from the level of elementary particles to the human cerebral cortex, the latest stage of evolution. Cerebral lateralization is one of the well-known asymmetries. This paper summarizes the data published in the past decades on the asymmetry of the neuroendocrine system. The information on the sided-differences between the gonads, adrenals, and thyroid lobes and that on the lateralization of hypothalamic, limbic, and other brain structures participating in the control of the endocrine glands as well as relevant clinical observations are reviewed here. The innervation of the peripheral endocrine glands is also briefly summarized because the afferent and efferent fibers of these glands may represent one part of the pathway involved in neuroendocrine asymmetry. The data reviewed clearly indicate that some kind of asymmetry (morphological, biochemical, physiological, pathological) is evident at different levels of the neuroendocrine system (at limbic, hypothalamic, peripheral endocrine glands and their innervation) and there are species, sex, and age differences. Most of the information accumulated deals with the CNS-gonadal system. A majority of the observations suggest that in both male and female rats there is a predominance of the right half of brain structures controlling gonadal function. The asymmetry, however, is not restricted to CNS structures: it also exists at the level of the gonads, including their innervation. It appears that the characteristic pattern of the CNS-gonadal system becomes fixed only after sexual maturation. Very few reports are available suggesting some kind of asymmetry of the CNS-adrenal cortex and the CNS-thyroid system. There are convincing findings consistent with the view that in addition to the hypothalamo-adenohypophyseal system acting via the general circulation on the peripheral endocrine glands, there is also a pure neural link between the CNS and the gonads, the CNS and the adrenal gland, and also between the CNS and the thyroid. This link contains afferent and efferent pathways and is able to modulate the functional activity or the responsiveness of the gland. It may also serve as a neural reflex arc. It is assumed that the neuroendocrine asymmetry expresses itself through (i) hypophysiotrophic neurohormones and hormones of the peripheral endocrine glands, (ii) neural pathways, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). The authors hope that this publication, in addition to providing an overview, will also stimulate research, both basic and clinical, in this exciting area of neuroendocrinology.

1276,"Comparative study of anatomical connectivity of prelemniscal radiations in healthy subjects and Parkinso's disease patients. Objective: Characterize the anatomic connectivity of prelemniscal radiations (Raprl) and identify differences in the fiber populations that conform the Raprl using probabilistic tractography. Background(s): The Raprl have been proposed as a neurosurgical target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of PD since 1970's. Despite its clinical usefulness the anatomic connectivity of the Raprl remains unknown. Method(s): Images from 12 healthy subjects and 6 PD patients were acquired using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner. Diffusionweighted images were acquired using 120 unique diffusion-gradient directions with beta=2000s/mm2 (voxel size of 2x2x2mm3). Constrained spherical deconvolution was performed, followed by the creation of track-density images using MRtrix (Brain Research Institute Australia), resulting in final resolution of 0.2x0.2x0.2mm3; these images were crucial for the accurate manual segmentation of subthalamic structures. We seeded 50000 streamlines at the level of the Raprl, differences of streamlines interconnecting the Raprl between groups were assessed by Student's t-test. Result(s): All subjects showed Raprl connectivity with cortical and subcortical structures, when these fiber bundles enter the posterior limb of internal capsule they show a clear spatial organization according to their targets, from anterior to posterior as follows: 1) orbitofrontal cortex, 2) globus pallidus (GP) 3) supplementary motor area and 4) primary motor cortex and cerebellum. In 87.5% of healthy subjects GP showed connectivity with the contralateral dorsal brainstem in a region that corresponds to the location of the contralateral pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), the same connectivity pattern is present in 83.3% of PD patients. The number of reconstructed streamlines obtained showed differences between groups in the connectivity to pallidum (left p=0.017, right p=0.045) and in thalamus (left p=0.02, right p=0.006). Conclusion(s): PD patients that have undergone Raprl-DBS show an improvement on gait that also occurs after unilateral GP-DBS, which could be explained because of the bilateral connections from Raprl to PPN through fibers crossing the midline at lower midbrain. Our findings provide new insights into subthalamic connectivity that allow explaining clinical benefits obtained after Raprl-DBS.",Excluded
1399,"Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Functional Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta) Activity and Benefit of TGFbeta Inhibition in Irradiated Intracranial Tumors. Purpose: Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) promotes cell survival by endorsing DNA damage repair and mediates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, TGFbeta activation in response to radiation therapy is potentially targetable because it opposes therapeutic control. Strategies to assess this potential in the clinic are needed. Methods and Materials: We evaluated positron emission tomography (PET) to image <sup>89</sup>Zr -fresolimumab, a humanized TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, as a means to detect TGFbeta activation in intracranial tumor models. Pathway activity of TGFbeta was validated by immunodetection of phosphorylated SMAD2 and the TGFbeta target, tenascin. The contribution of TGFbeta to radiation response was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of mice bearing intracranial murine tumor models GL261 and SB28 glioblastoma and brain-adapted 4T1 breast cancer (4T1-BrA) treated with TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 1D11, and/or focal radiation (10 Gy). Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detected engineered, physiological, and radiation-induced TGFbeta activation, which was confirmed by immunostaining of biological markers. GL261 glioblastoma tumors had a greater PET signal compared with similar-sized SB28 glioblastoma tumors, whereas the widespread PET signal of 4T1-BrA intracranial tumors was consistent with their highly dispersed histologic distribution. Survival of mice bearing intracranial tumors treated with 1D11 neutralizing antibody alone was similar to that of mice treated with control antibody, whereas 1D11 improved survival when given in combination with focal radiation. The extent of survival benefit of a combination of radiation and 1D11 was associated with the degree of TGFbeta activity detected by PET. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detects radiation-induced TGFbeta activation in tumors. Functional imaging indicated a range of TGFbeta activity in intracranial tumors, but TGFbeta blockade provided survival benefit only in the context of radiation treatment. This study provides further evidence that radiation-induced TGFbeta activity opposes therapeutic response to radiation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Treatment with corticosteroids, surgery, and antioxidants is often ineffective.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed 15 patients of HPC treated in our institute from 2001 to 2011. Clinical characteristics and treatment modality, in the form of surgery and radiotherapy, were noted. Statistical analysis was done with regards to recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results The median age of the patients was 40.0 years. Nine patients were males and six patients were females. The median duration of symptoms was six months. Headache was the most common presenting symptom followed by vomiting, motor weakness and seizures. Twelve patients underwent total excision while three had subtotal excision. Seven patients had WHO grade II histology tumors and eight patients had grade III histology. Thirteen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Median RT dose delivered was 50 Gy. Five patients developed local recurrence. One patient had distant metastases. Median duration of RFS was 68 months. Conclusions HPCs are aggressive tumors.

BACKGROUND: To investigate geometric and dosimetric accuracy of frame-less image-guided radiosurgery (IG-RS) for brain metastases.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Single fraction IG-RS was practiced in 72 patients with 98 brain metastases. Patient positioning and immobilization used either double- (n = 71) or single-layer (n = 27) thermoplastic masks. Pre-treatment set-up errors (n = 98) were evaluated with cone-beam CT (CBCT) based image-guidance (IG) and were corrected in six degrees of freedom without an action level. CBCT imaging after treatment measured intra-fractional errors (n = 64). Pre- and post-treatment errors were simulated in the treatment planning system and target coverage and dose conformity were evaluated. Three scenarios of 0 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm GTV-to-PTV (gross tumor volume, planning target volume) safety margins (SM) were simulated.RESULTS: Errors prior to IG were 3.9 mm +/- 1.7 mm (3D vector) and the maximum rotational error was 1.7degree +/- 0.8degree on average. The post-treatment 3D error was 0.9 mm +/- 0.6 mm. No differences between double- and single-layer masks were observed. Intra-fractional errors were significantly correlated with the total treatment time with 0.7 mm +/- 0.5 mm and 1.2 mm +/- 0.7 mm for treatment times <=23 minutes and >23 minutes (p<0.01), respectively. Simulation of RS without image-guidance reduced target coverage and conformity to 75% +/- 19% and 60% +/- 25% of planned values. Each 3D set-up error of 1 mm decreased target coverage and dose conformity by 6% and 10% on average, respectively, with a large inter-patient variability. Pre-treatment correction of translations only but not rotations did not affect target coverage and conformity. Post-treatment errors reduced target coverage by >5% in 14% of the patients. A 1 mm safety margin fully compensated intra-fractional patient motion.CONCLUSIONS: IG-RS with online correction of translational errors achieves high geometric and dosimetric accuracy. Intra-fractional errors decrease target coverage and conformity unless compensated with appropriate safety margins.",Excluded

Purpose or Objective The role of APBI for patients with low-risk breast cancer has gained popularity as an alternative to the conventional whole breast irradiation (WBI) with external beam radiation. Multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy with flexible catheters located around the lumpectomy cavity is one of the oldest APBI techniques with the longest experience. The aim of the study was to report the results of 218 patients with at least 5-year follow-up treated with APBI using interstitial multicatheter high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) after breast-conserving surgery. Material and Methods From July 2006 to October 2017, 443 women with lowrisk invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ after BCS underwent APBI using interstitial multicatheter HDR brachytherapy at our department. In the analyzed group, 218 patients were followed up for 5 years or longer. The inclusion criteria were: ZUBROD 0 or 1, age <sup>3</sup>50 years, T1-2N0M0, T<=3cm, unifocally, invasive carcinoma without neuroinvasion, angioinvasion, minimal surgical margin 2mm or DCIS with minimal margin at least 5mm, without EIC (extensive intraductal component), positive estrogen receptors. The time between surgery and HDR-BT was more than 12 weeks. 78% of the analyzed patients underwent APBI under local anesthesia. The total dose was 32Gy in 8 fractions delivered twice-daily with a minimum 6-hour break. The primary endpoint was local recurrence. Results The median age was 62 years (range 47-86 years). All patients completed treatment without interruptions. There were no serious complications during the procedure. In 18% of the patients a hematoma following catheter insertion was noticed, which typically resolved within 2 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated. Near 2% of the patients developed local inflammation, requiring oral antibiotic therapy. In almost 20% of cases, prophylactic antibiotic therapy was applied. PTV range was 17.1-175cm<sup>3</sup>. The median D10 and D2 for the lungs were 29.4% and 38.1% reference dose, respectively. The median skin dose was 43.7% reference dose (range 17- 68%). The median PTV<inf>100</inf> was 95%, DHI 0.68 and COIN 0.69. The median follow-up for 218 patients was 87 months (range 61-133 months). There were no late serious complications. In the group of 218 patient we found 4 failures (1.83%), including 3 local recurrences and one case of distant metastases. Conclusion Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation Using Sole Interstitial Multicatheter High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy allows to spare critical organs from unnecessary radiation. In our group of patients with at least 5-year follow-up, implant parameters were satisfying, correlated with good tolerance and effectiveness.",Excluded
1519,"Synchrotron-based in vivo tracking of implanted mammalian cells. We have developed an X-ray imaging protocol that permits 3D visualisation of a small number of implanted cells within bulk tissue. The cells are marked using natural endocytosis of inert gold nano-particles. The resulting local increase in electron density allows high imaging contrast to be obtained from small clusters of these marked cells. Using this technique we have imaged C6 glioma cells within the brain of a model animal. The cells were marked by exposing them to colloidal gold incorporated in the growth media. Gold-loaded glioma cells were implanted into the brains of adult male Wistar rats. After tumours had been allowed to develop for up to 2 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and images of the intact cranium were acquired at the SYRMEP imaging station on the Elettra synchrotron in Italy. Computed tomography was performed using mixed absorption and phase contrast techniques at an X-ray energy of 24 keV. In the resulting volume datasets the tumour bulk is clearly visible and the infiltrating nature of the malignant growth is well demonstrated. Although the protocol was developed using this particular model of malignant brain tumour, it is believed that it will be possible to use it with other cell lines. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2220,"Recent advances in research on radiofrequency fields and health: 2001-2003. The widespread use of wireless telecommunications devices, particularly mobile phones, has resulted in increased human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields. Although national and international agencies have established safety guidelines for exposure to RF fields, concerns remain about the potential for adverse health outcomes to occur in relation to RF field exposure. The extensive literature on RF fields and health has been reviewed by a number of authorities, including the Royal Society of Canada (1999), the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity, and the Environment (CSTEE, 2001), the British Medical Association (2001), the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority (Boice & McLaughlin, 2002), and the Health Council of the Netherlands (2002). This report provides an update on recent research results on the potential health risks of RF fields since the publication of the Royal Society of Canada report in 1999 (See Krewski et al., 2001a) and our previous 2001 update (Krewski et al., 2001b), covering the period 2001-2003. The present report examines new data on dosimetry and exposure assessment, biological effects such as enzyme induction, and toxicological effects, including genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and testicular and reproductive outcomes. Epidemiological studies of mobile phone users and occupationally exposed populations are examined, along with human and animal studies of neurological and behavioral effects. All of the authoritative reviews completed within the last 2 yr have concluded that there is no clear evidence of adverse health effects associated with RF fields. However, following a recent review of nine epidemiological studies of mobile phones and cancer, Kundi et al. (2004) concluded that the possibility of an enhanced cancer risk cannot be excluded. These same reviews support the need for further research to clarify the possible associations between RF fields and adverse health outcomes that have appeared in some reports. The results of the ongoing World Health Organization (WHO) study of mobile phones will provide important new information in this regard. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Excluded
1713,"Progressive and reproducible focal cortical ischemia with or without late spontaneous reperfusion generated by a ring-shaped, laser-driven photothrombotic lesion in rats. Clinical stroke is mostly of thromboembolic origin, in which the magnitude of brain damage resulting from arterial occlusions depends on the degree and duration of the concomitant ischemia. To facilitate more controllable and reproducible study of stroke-related pathophysiological mechanisms, a photothrombotic ring stroke model was initially developed in adult rats. The ring interior zone comprises an anatomically well confined cortical region-at-risk which is gradually encroached by progressive hypoperfusion, thus mimicking the situation (albeit in inverse fashion) of an ischemic penumbra or stroke-in-evolution. Modification of this model using a thinner ring irradiation beam resulted in late spontaneous reperfusion in the cortical region-at-risk and a remarkable morphological tissue recovery in this ostensibly critically injured region. On the other hand, doubling the thin irradiating beam intensity facilitates a complementary situation in which lack of reperfusion in the region-at-risk after stroke induction leads to tissue pannecrosis. The dual photothrombotic ring stroke model, effectuated either with or without reperfusion and thereby tissue recovery or pannecrosis, may be well suited for the study of events related to postischemic survival or cell death in the penumbra region. To popularize the photothrombotic ring stroke model, we present a detailed protocol of how this model is induced in either version as well as protocols for transcardial carbon black perfusion and laser-Doppler flowmetry experiments. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
1948,"Targeted Delivery of Iron Oxide Nanoparticle-Loaded Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Spherical Neural Masses for Treating Intracerebral Hemorrhage. This study evaluated the potential of iron oxide nanoparticle-loaded human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived spherical neural masses (SNMs) to improve the transportation of stem cells to the brain, ameliorate brain damage from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and recover the functional status after ICH under an external magnetic field of a magnet attached to a helmet. At 24 h after induction of ICH, rats were randomly separated into three experimental groups: ICH with injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS group), ICH with intravenous injection of magnetosome-like ferrimagnetic iron oxide nanocubes (FION)-labeled SNMs (SNMs* group), and ICH with intravenous injection of FION-labeled SNMs followed by three days of external magnetic field exposure for targeted delivery by a magnet-embedded helmet (SNMs*+Helmet group). On day 3 after ICH induction, an increased Prussian blue-stained area and decreased swelling volume were observed in the SNMs*+Helmet group compared with that of the other groups. A significantly decreased recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils and a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines followed by improved neurological function three days after ICH were observed in the SNMs*+Helmet group. Hemispheric atrophy at six weeks after ICH was significantly decreased in the SNMs*+Helmet group compared with that of the PBS group. In conclusion, we have developed a targeted delivery system using FION tagged to stem cells and a magnet-embedded helmet. The targeted delivery of SNMs might have the potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies for ICH.",Excluded
1502,"Destabilization of peptide binding and interdomain communication by an E543K mutation in the bovine 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein, a molecular chaperone. We have compared 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein (Hsc70) isolated from bovine brain with recombinant wild type protein and mutant E543K protein (previously studied as wild type in our laboratory). Wild type bovine and recombinant protein differ by posttranslational modification of lysine 561 but interact similarly with a short peptide (fluorescein-labeled FYQLALT) and with denatured staphylococcal nuclease-(Delta135-149). Mutation E543K results in 4. 5-fold faster release of peptide and lower stability of complexes with staphylococcal nuclease-(Delta135-149). ATP hydrolysis rates of the wild type proteins are enhanced 6-10-fold by the addition of peptide. The E543K mutant has a peptide-stimulated hydrolytic rate similar to that of wild type protein but a higher unstimulated rate, yielding a mere 2-fold enhancement. All three versions of Hsc70 possess similar ATP-dependent conformational shifts, and all show potassium ion dependence. These data support the following model: (i) in the presence of K+, Mg2+, and ATP, the peptide binding domain inhibits the ATPase; (ii) binding of peptide relieves this inhibition; and (iii) the E543K mutation significantly attenuates the inhibition by the peptide binding domain and destabilizes Hsc70-peptide complexes.",Excluded
1564,"Invited review: gender issues related to spaceflight: a NASA perspective. This minireview provides an overview of known and potential gender differences in physiological responses to spaceflight. The paper covers cardiovascular and exercise physiology, barophysiology and decompression sickness, renal stone risk, immunology, neurovestibular and sensorimotor function, nutrition, pharmacotherapeutics, and reproduction. Potential health and functional impacts associated with the various physiological changes during spaceflight are discussed, and areas needing additional research are highlighted. Historically, studies of physiological responses to microgravity have not been aimed at examining gender-specific differences in the astronaut population. Insufficient data exist in most of the discipline areas at this time to draw valid conclusions about gender-specific differences in astronauts, in part due to the small ratio of women to men. The only astronaut health issue for which a large enough data set exists to allow valid conclusions to be drawn about gender differences is orthostatic intolerance following shuttle missions, in which women have a significantly higher incidence of presyncope during stand tests than do men. The most common observation across disciplines is that individual differences in physiological responses within genders are usually as large as, or larger than, differences between genders. Individual characteristics usually outweigh gender differences per se. [References: 65]",Excluded
1983,"[Brain lesions after radiotherapy]. On the basis of literature reports up to 1988 the incidence, clinical pattern and treatment of cerebral complications following radiotherapy administered to the organs and tissues of the head are discussed. Acute radiation-induced reaction and early delayed reaction in the form of e.g. the so called somnolence syndrome or rhombencephalopathy are rare and their prognosis is usually good. In 1 to 14% of the patients delayed reaction may develop corresponding to the late radiation necrosis, usually with progressive unfavourable course. A problem of practical importance is the impossibility of differentiating radiation-induced cerebral necrosis from recurrence, expansion of the primary tumour or metastatic tumour, even using CT and MNR. Only the poorly available positron emission tomography makes possible differential diagnosis. Sometimes, surgical or pharmacological treatment of cerebral necrosis is effective.

1711,"Prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm for head and neck paragangliomas. Purpose/Objective(s): Paragangliomas of the head and neck represent a wide range of predominantly indolent tumors which may cause serious functional deficits if ignored yet its treatment may result in severe iatrogenic morbidity. Surgery and radiation therapy are both established modalities when treatment is warranted but how to integrate these two modalities to optimize tumor control, minimize iatrogenic morbidity and preserve organ function is not clearly established. To this end, a prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm was established at our center over the past decade. Patients were diagnosed by anatomic and functional imaging characteristics typically determined by CT/MRI and octreotide avidity. In general, patients who had a solitary carotid body tumor were offered surgery; while those involving the skull base were offered radiation therapy and those with multiple paragangliomas were offered either surgery for the smaller tumor and radiation for the remaining tumors or radiation for all tumors. Materials/Methods: From 1998-2011, 51 patients (42F:9M) were treated with definitive radiation therapy. Median age was 64 years (range, 19-92 year). Paraganglioma subsites were as follows: jugular 44% (n=24), tympanic 20% (n=11), vagal 15% (n=8), carotid body 13% (n=7), parasympathetic 2% (n=1). Two patients had bilateral tumors, while 2 patients had 3 synchronous tumors. The median radiation dose was 45 Gy (21-50.4 Gy) treated with 3D technique in 72% (n=39), IMRT in 20% (n=11) or SBRT 2% (n=1). During this time period, 38 patients underwent primary surgery of whom 6 received adjuvant radiation therapy. Result(s): At a median follow-up of 34 months (4-103 mos), one patient treated with radiation therapy failed at 37 months for a 3 year actuarial LC 100% and 5 year LC 94%. None of the 38 surgically treated failed. Patients who received radiation therapy experienced grade 1/2 complications including mucositis (13%) or xerostomia (23%), and two patients developed dizziness (5%). Of patients who underwent surgical excision, four patients had post-operative cranial nerve deficits, including vocal fold paresis, Horner's syndrome, hearing loss, and temporary facial nerve weakness. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this experience represents the first prospective algorithmic-based multidisciplinary approach with an emphasis on single modality treatment that demonstrates excellent tumor control, low rates of severe iatrogenic morbidity and long-term function preservation. While both surgery and radiation result in excellent tumor control, radiation therapy should be considered a primary treatment for skull-based paraganglioma for which it offers a high therapeutic ratio.",Excluded
1991,"Set-up uncertainties: online correction with X-ray volume imaging. AIM: To determine interfractional three-dimensional set-up errors using X-ray volumetric imaging (XVI).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2007 and August 2009, 125 patients were taken up for image-guided radiotherapy using online XVI. After matching of reference and acquired volume view images, set-up errors in three translation directions were recorded and corrected online before treatment each day. Mean displacements, population systematic (SIGMA), and random (sigma) errors were calculated and analyzed using SPSS (v16) software. Optimum clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin was calculated using Van Herk's (2.5SIGMA + 0.7 sigma) and Stroom's (2SIGMA + 0.7 sigma) formula.RESULTS: Patients were grouped in 4 cohorts, namely brain, head and neck, thorax, and abdomen-pelvis. The mean vector displacement recorded were 0.18 cm, 0.15 cm, 0.36 cm, and 0.35 cm for brain, head and neck, thorax, and abdomen-pelvis, respectively. Analysis of individual mean set-up errors revealed good agreement with the proposed 0.3 cm isotropic margins for brain and 0.5 cm isotropic margins for head-neck. Similarly, 0.5 cm circumferential and 1 cm craniocaudal proposed margins were in agreement with thorax and abdomen-pelvic cases.CONCLUSION: The calculated mean displacements were well within CTV-PTV margin estimates of Van Herk (90% population coverage to minimum 95% prescribed dose) and Stroom (99% target volume coverage by 95% prescribed dose). Employing these individualized margins in a particular cohort ensure comparable target coverage as described in literature, which is further improved if XVI-aided set-up error detection and correction is used before treatment.",Excluded
1328,"Primary CNS lymphoma. Primary CNS lymphoma, an uncommon form of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, has increased in incidence and occurs in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Primary CNS lymphoma in immunocompetent patients is associated with unique diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic issues and the management of this malignancy is different from other forms of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Characteristic imaging features should lead to suspicion of the diagnosis, avoidance of corticosteroids (if possible) and early neurosurgical consultation for stereotactic biopsy. Since primary CNS lymphoma may involve the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and eyes, diagnostic evaluation should include assessment of all of these regions as well as screening for the possibility of occult systemic disease. Resection provides no therapeutic benefit and should be reserved for the rare patient with neurological deterioration due to brain herniation. Whole-brain radiation therapy alone is insufficient for durable tumor control and is associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity in patients over 60 years of age. Neurotoxicity is typically associated with significant cognitive, motor and autonomic dysfunction and has a negative impact on quality of life. Chemotherapy and whole-brain radiation therapy together improve tumor response rates and survival compared with whole-brain radiation therapy alone. Methotrexate-based multiagent chemotherapy without whole-brain radiation therapy is associated with similar tumor response rates and survival compared with regimens that include whole-brain radiation therapy, although controlled trials have not been performed. The risk of neurotoxicity is lower in patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The incidence of HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma has decreased in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Patients with HIV-associated primary CNS lymphoma have a worse prognosis but may respond to highly active antiretroviral therapy, whole-brain radiation therapy or therapies directed against the Epstein-Barr virus.

2228,"Modeling depression: social dominance-submission gene expression patterns in rat neocortex. Gene expression profiles in the cortex of adult Long-Evans rats as a function of a stressful social loss and victory in inter-male fighting encounters were examined. This social dominance and subordination model has been postulated to simulate early changes in the onset of depression in the losers. Microarrays were fabricated containing 45mer oligonucleotides spotted in quadruplicate and representing 1178 brain-associated genes. Dynamic range, discrimination power, accuracy and reproducibility were determined with standard mRNA ""spiking"" studies. Gene expression profiles in dominant and subordinate animals were compared using a ""universal"" reference design [Churchill GA (2002) Fundamentals of experimental design for cDNA microarrays. Nat Genet 32 (Suppl):490-495].

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:5116-5121; van de Wiel MA (2004) Significance analysis of microarrays using rank scores. Kwantitatieve Methoden 71:25-37].

Genome Biol 4(4):R28]. And finally, genes of special interest were further studied using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-two transcripts were statistically significantly differentially expressed in the neocortex between dominant and subordinate animals. Ontological analyses revealed that significant gene changes were clustered primarily into functional neurochemical pathways associated with protein biosynthesis and cytoskeletal dynamics. The most robust of these were the increased expression of interleukin-18, heat shock protein 27, beta3-tubulin, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 in subordinate animals. Interleukin-18 has been found to be over-expressed in human depression and panic disorder as well as other physiological stress paradigms [Takeuchi M, Okura T, Mori T, Akita K, Ohta T, Ikeda M, Ikegami H, Kurimoto M (1999) Intracellular production of interleukin-18 in human epithelial-like cell lines is enhanced by hyperosmotic stress in vitro. Cell Tissue Res 297(3):467-473] and heat shock proteins have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders [Iwamoto K, Kakiuchi C, Bundo M, Ikeda K, Kato T (2004) Molecular characterization of bipolar disorder by comparing gene expression profiles of postmortem brains of major mental disorders.

1339,"Electrically evoked GABA release in rat hippocampus CA1 region and its changes during kindling epileptogenesis. Previous findings on changes in K+-induced GABA release from hippocampal slices during kindling epileptogenesis were reinvestigated using physiological electrical stimulation. For that purpose, a procedure was developed enabling neurochemical monitoring of GABA release locally in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices upon tetanic stimulation of Schaffer-collateral fibers. In the presence of a GABA reuptake blocker, subsequent application of short (3 s) pulses of 50-Hz stimuli induced a local transient increase in GABA release. In slices from fully kindled animals, 24 h after the last generalized seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release was increased in comparison to control slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, 4-5 weeks after the last seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release had returned to control levels. Application of the broad low-affinity GABAB receptor antagonist saclofen increased the tetanically stimulated GABA release in control slices, but had no effect in fully kindled slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, however, saclofen enhanced GABA release similarly as in control slices. We conclude that the transient increase in tetanus-induced GABA release during kindling epileptogenesis is seizure-related, and probably caused by temporarily impaired presynaptic GABAB receptors. The possible relevance of this finding for GABA transmission in epilepsy is discussed.",Excluded

An improved understanding of tumor biology, the ability to target tumor drivers, and the ability to harness the immune system have dramatically improved the expected survival of patients diagnosed with cancer.

Fortunately, the evolution of radiation delivery and operative techniques permits durable tumor control with a decreased risk of treatment-related toxicity and a greater emphasis on restoration of quality of life and daily function. Stereotactic body radiotherapy allows delivery of ablative radiation doses to the majority of spine tumors, reducing the need for surgery. Among patients who still require surgery for decompression of the spinal cord or spinal column stabilization, minimal access approaches and targeted tumor excision and ablation techniques minimize the surgical risk and facilitate postoperative recovery.

Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate the image quality on both axial and three-dimensional CT angiograms of the brain at various tube potentials and currents, and to propose the use of descriptors for evaluating the image quality of three-dimensional CT angiograms using entropy analysis. Method(s): A head phantom was used as a target object. Axial CT and threedimensional CT angiograms were obtained at various effective milliampere-second values (49-350 mAs) and tube potentials (80-140 kVp) with a 64-row detector CT scanner. Lens doses were measured using a planar silicon pin-photodiode system. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and streak artefacts on the axial CT angiograms were evaluated and the image quality of the three-dimensional CT angiograms was assessed using entropy analysis. Result(s): Lens doses increased with tube potential and effective milliampere-seconds. From the evaluation of SNR and streak artefacts on axial CT angiograms, we found that the image quality was improved by setting the tube potential at 100 kVp. However, there was little visual difference in the image quality for 100 kVp between 252 (effective value recommended by the manufacturer) and 350 mAs (maximum effective value). In the entropy analysis of the image quality of three-dimensional CT angiograms, the mutual information (information gain) per lens dose was largest at 80 kVp and 252 mAs.

2371,"Against the motion: This house believes that hippocampus avoiding WBI is the current standard of care. Because of advances in the management of several solid tumours such as NSCLC, breast cancer, melanoma, the risk of developing brain metastases (BM) seems to increase as survival is prolonged. Their management represents a real challenge because Symptomatic BM can cause life-threatening symptoms and serious impairment of quality of life. In the last 15 years, there has been development and widespread use of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), but this concerns a subgroup of patients who have a limited number of brain lesions, for whom brain SRT and/or surgery can be proposed. This strategy provides better results than whole-brain irradiation (WBI) with median survival exceeding 12 months. WBI is still regarded as standard treatment for multiple symptomatic BM, not accessible to SRT even though a randomised trial does not seem to support the use of this approach versus best supportive care in NSCLC. There is strong concern about the toxicity of such treatment. Acute toxicity is generally manageable but long-term sequelae such as neurocognitive toxicity and ataxia, are deleterious to the quality of life of patients. There are areas of active research that hold great potential to reduce the risk of neurocognitive decline after WBI such as hippocampal-sparing radiotherapy and the use of neuroprotective agents. As neurocognitive toxicity from WBI related to damage to neural progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and hippocampus and the induction of inflammation in the brain, several studies have been performed assessing hippocampus avoiding irradiation, considering that BM in the hippocampal region seem rare (about 5%), Promising results have been reported in patients having undergone WBI to treat BM. Another challenging area is evaluating prophylactic cranial irradiation with hippocampus avoidance, with contrasting preliminary results. The cause of radiation injury to the brain is likely to be multifactorial, and reducing radiation dose to the hippocampus may not be the only way to reduce neurotoxicity. Furthermore we need more mature results to conclude that it should the new standard of care. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded

Introduction: Treatment options for relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) post-chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T) are limited. Here, we report the successful treatment of R/R DLBCL with programmed cell death 1 (PD1) inhibition post-allogeneic CAR-T. Case Report: A previously healthy 26-year-old Caucasian man developed B-symptoms and cervical lymphadenopathy. Biopsy revealed DLBCL, activated B-cell subtype, double expressor and Ki-67 >80%. PET/CT scan revealed disease above and below the diaphragm. He achieved a partial response (PR) after R-CHOP, progressive disease (PD) after R-ICE, stable disease (SD) after R-ESHAP, and PD one month after autologous CD19-targeted CAR-T with CTL019 (CD3zeta/4-1BB). He then received R-lenalidomide (len) with radiation (24 Gy) to his mediastinal mass achieving a PR, followed by a myeloablative (Cy/TBI-12 Gy) allogeneic stem cell transplant (aSCT) from his 10/10 HLAmatched brother. He achieved 100% donor chimerism 30 days post-aSCT (D+30). Despite persistent full donor chimerism, D+60 PET/CT showed PD with confirmed relapse upon biopsy. Immunosuppression was discontinued, and ibrutinib with len was started, followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) which led to a mixed response. He then continued on ibrutinib with weekly temsirolimus and received a second DLI achieving a PR, with PD shortly thereafter. He next proceeded to allogeneic CAR-T with axicabtagene-ciloleucel (CD3zeta/CD28), complicated by grade 1 cytokine release syndrome without neurotoxicity. Three weeks post-CAR-T, he developed diplopia due to a cranial nerve palsy. Brain MRI showed new pontine T2 changes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for lymphoma and infection, but notable for T-cell predominance. One month postCAR-T, PET/CT showed a complete metabolic response (CMR). Repeat brain MRI was unchanged. Two months later, he developed dizziness and intractable nausea, and repeat brain MRI showed a new lesion in the inferior cerebellar vermis, with resolution of previous pontine change. Evaluation of the CSF and peripheral blood revealed no CAR T-cell persistence, and PET/CT confirmed disease relapse in the cerebellum and mediastinum. Patient then received focal radiation (24 Gy) to his cerebellar lesion along with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, after which his neurologic symptoms resolved. MRI one day after radiation showed near-complete resolution of enhancing vermis lesion. After 3 cycles of pembrolizumab, PET/CT showed a CMR, with no active disease on brain MRI. Three months into PD1-inhibition therapy, his disease remains in CMR, without GVHD nor treatment-related toxicities. Conclusion(s): This case illustrates the efficacy of allogeneic CAR-T after failure of autologous CAR-T and aSCT. Furthermore, PD1 inhibition can be used safely after allogeneic CAR-T, underscoring the need for prospective clinical studies. Copyright © 2018",Excluded
2429,"Elevated DNA damage in a mouse model of oxidative stress: impacts of ionizing radiation and a protective dietary supplement. Transgenic growth hormone (Tg) mice express elevated free radical processes and a progeroid syndrome of accelerated ageing. We examined bone marrow cells of Tg mice and their normal (Nr) siblings for three markers of DNA damage and assessed the impact of free radical stress using ionizing radiation. We also evaluated the radiation protection afforded by a dietary supplement that we previously demonstrated to extend longevity and reduce cognitive ageing of Nr and Tg mice. Spectral karyotyping revealed few spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in Nr or Tg. Tg mice, however, had significantly greater constitutive levels of both gammaH2AX and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) compared to Nr. When exposed to a 2-Gy whole-body dose of ionizing radiation, both Nr and Tg mice showed significant increases in DNA damage. Compared to Nr mice, irradiated Tg mice had dramatically higher levels of gammaH2AX foci and double the levels of chromosomal aberrations. In unirradiated mice, the dietary supplement significantly reduced constitutive gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in both Nr and Tg mice (normalizing both gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in Tg), with little difference in gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG over constitutive levels. Induced chromosomal aberrations were also reduced, and in Nr mice, virtually absent. Remarkably, supplemented mice expressed 6-fold lower levels of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations compared to unsupplemented Nr or Tg mice. Based on our data, the dietary supplement appeared to scavenge free radicals before they could cause damage. This study validates Tg mice as an exemplary model of oxidative stress and radiation hypersensitivity and documents unprecedented radioprotection by a dietary supplement comprised of ingredients available to the general public.",Included
1728,"Measurements and models of electric fields in the in vivo human brain during transcranial electric stimulation. Transcranial electric stimulation aims to stimulate the brain by applying weak electrical currents at the scalp. However, the magnitude and spatial distribution of electric fields in the human brain are unknown. We measured electric potentials intracranially in ten epilepsy patients and estimated electric fields across the entire brain by leveraging calibrated current-flow models. When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.8 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (r = 0.86) and depth (r = 0.88) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments. This is the first study to validate and calibrate current-flow models with in vivo intracranial recordings in humans, providing a solid foundation to target stimulation and interpret clinical trials.",Excluded

The hearing function was studied as was the bioelectrical activity of the brain in workers exposed to noise in their occupations and in those persons coming into contact with ionizing radiation with normal and disordered hearing. The studies made showed that those persons under exposure to ionizing radiation exhibited more pronounced disturbances in the brain stem structures of the acoustic analyzer than those exposed to noise even if they were early in the course of the ear disorder. We consider it expedient to undertake studies on bioelectrical activity of the brain to gain further insights into the mechanisms of sensorineural hearing loss.,Excluded
1834,"Analysis of occupational radiation exposure during cerebral angiography utilizing a new real time radiation dose monitoring system. BACKGROUND: Thermoluminescent dosimeter badges currently utilized to monitor occupational radiation exposures are limited in their ability to provide timely feedback, restricting workers' ability to identify unnecessary exposure. New real time radiation monitoring systems provide an opportunity for workers to immediately identify and alter problematic behaviors in the neuroangiography suite, decreasing unnecessary exposures, lowering risk, and maximizing safety efforts.METHODS: Real time radiation monitoring was performed for 120 diagnostic cerebral angiography procedures. Data were collected in two phases, for procedures performed by two physician participants (30 procedures per physician per phase). Workers were blinded to their real time dose in phase I, and unblinded in phase II. Individual exposures (Sv) and the incidence of red events (exposure rates >=2.0 mSv/h) were collected for each assigned participating role (physician A, physician B, nurse, scrubbed technologist, and circulating technologist). The dose area product was collected for each procedure to standardize against variations in procedure duration or intensity.RESULTS: In phase II, significant decreased radiation exposure was observed for all roles except physician A. Physician B decreased most from 24.3x10(-8) to 6.9x10(-8) Sv/Gy-cm(2) (p<0.0001). Rates of red events decreased similarly for all roles except physician A, and were significant for all roles except the nurse role.CONCLUSIONS: Real time radiation dose monitoring during diagnostic cerebral angiography may help to reduce occupational radiation exposures for healthcare workers.",Excluded
2070,"Cost-Effectiveness of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Versus MRI Surveillance for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer. Purpose: Owing to conflicting prospective data, controversy exists regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PCI versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance for patients with ES-SCLC based on currently available evidence and in the context of the proposed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services alternative payment model. Methods and Materials: A Markov state transition model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing MRI surveillance alone with PCI for ES-SCLC. Clinical parameters were obtained from clinical trial data, and cost data were based on 2019 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and evaluated with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to consider model uncertainty. Result(s): In the base-case scenario, PCI was not cost-effective in this model, with an ICER of $168,456 per QALY gained compared with MRI surveillance alone, assuming that overall survival was 10 months for MRI surveillance alone and 12.5 months for PCI. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to the variation of overall survival and cognitive decline rates between the 2 groups. In a scenario analysis in which all patients received hippocampal-avoidance PCI, the model results became nearly cost-effective with PCI. Conclusion(s): PCI was not found to be cost-effective within this model compared with MRI surveillance alone, owing to the neurocognition decline effect of PCI based on available evidence. Hippocampal-avoidance PCI may be a potential cost-effective strategy for ES-SCLC, with confirmation expected after an ongoing prospective clinical trial (The Southwest Oncolology Group MRI Brain Surveillance Alone Versus MRI Surveillance And Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation [MAVERICK]), which includes assessments of cognitive function.

Although radiotherapy is often used to treat laryngeal carcinoma, there is little information on the effects of this treatment on laryngeal structures. Rats were irradiated to the head and neck region and the larynges were studied by light- and electron-microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Ten days after irradiation, a change in the ultrastructural appearance of the granules of the subglottic glands was observed. Substance P-, bombesin- and enkephalin-like immunoreactivity was increased in local ganglionic cells and glandular nerve fibres. The mast cells were reduced in number. At examination 4 6 months after irradiation, there were no obvious differences compared with controls concerning mast-cell numbers and neuropeptide expression. The ultrastructural changes seen in the subglottic glands remained to some extent. The results show that structural changes in the subglottic glands occur concomitantly with an increased expression of certain neuropeptides in the innervation of these glands, which implies a relationship between these two parameters. The mast cells respond drastically to irradiation, but in the long run, regeneration of these cells occurs.",Included

The paper describes for the first time the results of the radiation effect study using the example of the analysis of circulatory system disease mortality in newly established cohort combining the population exposed in 1950-1960 due to 2 radiation incidents in the Southern Urals (the Techa River and East-Urals radioactive Trace). The cohort consists of 60,205 people. Over a 65-year follow up period 14,830 deaths from all diseases of the circulatory system were registered. Out of this number 6,163 deaths were from ischemic heart disease, and 4,388 deaths were from cerebrovascular diseases. Analysis was performed on the basis of individualized estimates of dose accumulated in muscle tissue (both internal and external components of the dose), calculated with new Techa River Dosimetry System 2016. As per the latest calculations, mean dose to muscle tissue in members of the combined cohort was 34 mGy, maximum dose was 995 mGy. Simple parametric model of excess relative risk (ERR) was used in the analysis. The number of person-years at risk was 1836,203. The findings of the analysis show linear increase of mortality risk per unit dose from all the disease of circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy was 3%; 95% CI: 0,8%; 5,2%) and from ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy was 9,2%; 95% CI: 5,4%; 13,5%). with 15-year latent period. No statistically significant increase in mortality from the cerebrovascular diseases in the combined cohort of the population exposed in the Southern Urals over a 65-year period received evidence. The obtained results are in good agreement with those received in the analysis of the effect in the Techa River Cohort in 2013. The latter covered a 53-year period (with minimum latent period of 15 years) and revealed statistically significant linear dose response for all diseases of the circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy - 0.036) and ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy - 0.056).

1803,"(R)-roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, enhances tonic GABA inhibition in rat hippocampus. Pharmacological agents that mediate a persistent GABAergic conductance are of considerable interest for treatment of epilepsy. (R)-roscovitine is a membrane permeable cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, designed to block cell division. It is currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial as an anticancer drug. We show that (R)-roscovitine increases a tonic GABA-mediated current in rat hippocampal neurons. This enhanced tonic current appears independent of synaptic GABA release and requires functional transmembrane GABA transport. The effect of (R)-roscovitine is associated with neither modification of GABAA receptors nor protein kinase activity, but is associated with a significant increase in intracellular GABA concentration in hippocampal GABAergic neurons. (R)-roscovitine-induced tonic inhibition significantly suppresses spontaneous spiking activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Therefore, (R)-roscovitine is a potent modulator of neuronal activity in rat hippocampus and may provide a tool for preventing paroxysmal activity.",Excluded
1779,"A simpler method for total scalp irradiation: the multijaw-size concave arc technique. The lateral electron-photon technique (LEPT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are commonly used for total scalp irradiation. However, the treatment planning and irradiation are laborious and time-consuming. We herein present the multijaw-size concave arc technique (MCAT) as a total scalp irradiation method that overcomes these problems. CT datasets for eight patients previously treated for angiosarcoma of the scalp were replanned using MCAT, LEPT, and IMRT. The MCAT was designed with a dynamic conformal arc for the total scalp, with a multileaf collimator to shield the brain. Two additional conformal arcs with a decreased upper-jaw position of the first dynamic conformal arc were used to reduce the cranial hotspots. The prescribed dose was 40 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV, defined as the total scalp plus a 4 mm margin). MCAT was compared with LEPT and IMRT with respect to the PTV dose homogeneity (D5%-95%), underdosage (V < 90%), overdosage (V > 110%), doses to the brain, and the delivery time and monitor units (MUs) for single irradiation. We were able to formulate treatment plans for all three techniques that could deliver the prescription dose in all patients. MCAT was significantly superior to LEPT with respect to PTV dose homogeneity, overdosage, and underdosage, although MCAT was inferior to IMRT with respect to dose homogeneity and overdosage. The mean brain dose and high-dosage volume of all three techniques were low, but IMRT provided larger volume to the brain than did the other two techniques in the low dosage region. In MCAT, the mean delivery time could be reduced by approximately half or more, and the mean MUs could be reduced by at least 100 compared to the other two techniques. MCAT can achieve total scalp irradiation with substantially fewer MUs and a shorter delivery time than LEPT and IMRT.",Excluded
2075,"Possible effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure on central nerve system. Technological advances of mankind, through the development of electrical and communication technologies, have resulted in the exposure to artificial electromagnetic fields (EMF). Technological growth is expected to continue; as such, the amount of EMF exposure will continue to increase steadily. In particular, the use-time of smart phones, that have become a necessity for modern people, is steadily increasing. Social concerns and interest in the impact on the cranial nervous system are increased when considering the area where the mobile phone is used. However, before discussing possible effects of radiofrequency-electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) on the human body, several factors must be investigated about the influence of EMFs at the level of research using in vitro or animal models. Scientific studies on the mechanism of biological effects are also required. It has been found that RF-EMF can induce changes in central nervous system nerve cells, including neuronal cell apoptosis, changes in the function of the nerve myelin and ion channels; furthermore, RF-EMF act as a stress source in living creatures. The possible biological effects of RF-EMF exposure have not yet been proven, and there are insufficient data on biological hazards to provide a clear answer to possible health risks. Therefore, it is necessary to study the biological response to RF-EMF in consideration of the comprehensive exposure with regard to the use of various devices by individuals. In this review, we summarize the possible biological effects of RF-EMF exposure. Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society of Applied Pharmacology.",Excluded

1669,"N-desmethylclozapine an M1 receptor agonist enhances nitric oxide's cardiac vagal facilitation in the isolated innervated rat right atrium. We have previously determined that neuronal nitric oxide (NO) may partly mediate its established cholinergic effect via activation of muscarinic type 1 (M1) receptors located at the preganglionic/postganglionic synapse. In this series of experiments we set out to confirm this finding using an M1 agonist. Experiments were carried out on the isolated vagally innervated right atrium in the presence of atenolol (4 microM). The right vagus was stimulated at 4, 8, 16, 32 Hz; pulse duration 1 ms at 20 V for 20 s and the effect on cardiac interval (ms) assessed. N-desmethylclozapine (100 nM), a potent M1 agonist, enhanced the vagally induced increase in cardiac interval, a lower concentration of 50 nM had no significant effect on cardiac interval. This effect was prevented by pre-treatment of the atria with the neuronal NO synthase inhibitor 1 (2-trifluoromethylphenyl)imidazole (TRIM) at 0.14 mM. The vagal stimulation protocol was repeated in order to rule out a reduction in vagal effectiveness which may have been due to the experimental stimulation protocol used in this study. TRIM (0.14 mM) alone causes a small but significant attenuation of the vagally induced increase in cardiac interval. These results show that agonism of M1 receptors on cardiac vagal preganglionic fibres enhances vagal cardiac effects which can be prevented by a neuronal NO inhibitor.",Excluded
2390,"A calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance underlies the plateau potential in rat substantia nigra GABAergic neurons. Plateau potentials can be elicited in nigral GABAergic neurons by injection of 500 ms depolarizing current pulses from hyperpolarized holding potentials in whole-cell recordings in vitro. In approximately one-third of these neurons, plateau potentials were observed under control conditions and could be elicited in the remaining neurons after blocking potassium conductances. Application of the L-type calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 or activation of NMDA receptors enhanced plateau potentials observed under control conditions and caused a plateau to be elicited in neurons not exhibiting it previously. The plateau potential was abolished in calcium-free buffer, as well as by nickel or cadmium. The L-type calcium channel blockers nimodipine and nifedipine abolished the plateau potential observed under control conditions but did not affect plateaus unmasked by tetraethylammonium. Plateau potentials observed under control conditions as well as those observed in the presence of Bay K 8644, NMDA, or tetraethylammonium were abolished in low-sodium buffer and by the calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance blocker flufenamic acid. These data suggest that nigral plateau potentials are mediated by a calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance (I(CAN)) that is activated by calcium entry predominantly through L-type calcium channels. In many nigral neurons, I(CAN) is masked by tetraethylammonium-sensitive potassium conductances, but plateaus can be evoked after increasing calcium conductances. The I(CAN)-mediated plateau potential in nigral GABAergic neurons likely affects the way these neurons integrate input and may represent a mechanism contributing to the rhythmic firing of these neurons seen in pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.",Excluded

The structural organization of the retinula cells in the eye of Ligia exotica changes diurnally. At night, the microvilli elongate, losing the regular and parallel alignment characteristic of the day condition. Crystalline cones and distal rhabdom tips are not pushed into each other during the day, but at night the rhabdoms protrude into the crystalline cones by up to 5 microm. Screening pigment granules in the retinula cells disperse during the night, but migrate radially towards the vicinity of the rhabdom during the day. No such displacements of the pigment granules of either distal or proximal screening pigment cells were observed. The sensitivity of the eye, monitored by electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, changes diurnally: values at midnight are, on average, 10 times those occurring during the day. However, intracellular recordings from single retinula cells (50 during the day and 50 at night) indicate that the difference between night and day sensitivities is only 2.5-fold. Two-dimensional angular sensitivity curves, indicative of a single unit's spatial sensitivity, had considerably less regular outlines at night than during the day. If based on the 50 % sensitivity level, day and night eyes possessed receptive fields of almost identical width (approximately 2 degrees), but if sensitivities below the 50 % limit were included, then receptive fields at night were significantly more extensive. We suggest that the morphological adaptations and diurnal changes in chromophore content seen in the apposition eye of L. exotica allow this animal to improve its photon capture at night while preserving at least some of the spatial resolving power characteristic of the light-adapted state. This would explain why this animal is capable of performing complex escape behaviours in the presence of predators both in bright and in very dim light.",Excluded

This retrospective study used two dry skulls and secondary data from 15 patients who had more than one scan taken using the same machine. Two observers tested two types of regional voxel-based superimposition: maxillary and mandibular. The registration took 10-15 s.

The flash-induced reflectance increases (bleaching) were calculated by dividing the reflectance of the first image into the subsequent images, pixel by pixel.RESULTS: The topography of the bleached macula corresponded well with the anatomical distribution of the cones. The ratio of reflectance changes in the center to that in the surrounding tissue was high for red and low for green and blue images. These results indicate that the reflectivity changes were not artifacts but were derived from changes in the photopigment density in the cones and rods.CONCLUSIONS: The topography of bleached photoreceptors obtained with a commercial fundus camera from one monkey and three healthy human subjects showed that this technique has potential as a new clinical method for examining photoreceptor function in both normal and diseased retinas.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: The recommended treatment for O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter unmethylated glioblastoma (GBM) is radiation therapy with concurrent/adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). However, it is well known that the clinical benefit from TMZ is lower in these patients. We sought to analyze patterns of care and outcomes of chemoradiation versus radiation alone in this cohort using a large, hospital database.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM from 2010 to 2012 who received radiation (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT) were identified in the National Cancer Database. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of receiving chemoradiation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess overall survival (OS) by treatment group and Cox regression analysis was used to assess impact of covariates on OS.RESULTS: There were 738 patients who met the study criteria, of which 107 (14.5%) received RT alone and 631 (85.5%) received CRT with median RT dose 6000cGy for both groups. Median follow up for living patients was 21.9 months. Ninety-two (12.5%) patients did not undergo any resection, 330 (44.7%) underwent a subtotal resection and 316 (42.8%) had a gross total resection.

The biological effects of focal gamma ray irradiation on targeted or surrounding areas in the brain are not well-known. In the present study, we evaluated protein expression changes in the unilateral irradiated (60 Gy) striatum in rat. Striata of irradiated and control brains were dissected 16 h post-irradiation for analysis by large-format two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE). In parallel, we also examined the un-targeted contralateral striatum over the control for potential changes in proteins patterns that may have occurred due to the effects of irradiation to the unilateral striatum. A total of 17 reproducible and differentially expressed silver nitrate-stained protein spots in the irradiated striatum was detected on 2-D gel. Their subsequent analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-LC-MS/MS) resulted in the identification of 13 nonredundant proteins. Interestingly, out of these 13 changed proteins, 2 proteins were also detected in the contralateral striatum. Some of the significantly changed proteins identified were creatine kinase, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (PDA3), and peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2). Western analysis with anti-PDA3 and anti-Prx2 antibodies revealed 4 and 2 cross-reacting protein spots on 2-D gel blots. Interestingly, after GKS, in the irradiated and un-irradiated striata, these spots showed a shift toward the acidic side, suggesting post-translational modifications.

Time-resolved spectroscopy is employed to measure the mean optical path length (PL), and the absorption (mu(a)) and reduced scattering (mu(s)') coefficients in multiple positions of the human head. Monte Carlo simulations are performed on four-layered head models based on an individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to determine mu(a) and mu(s)' in each layer of the head by solving inverse problems, and to estimate the partial path length in the brain (p-PL) and the spatial sensitivity to regions in the brain at the source-detector separation of 30 mm. The PL is closely related to the thickness of the scalp, but not to that of other layers of the head. The p-PL is negatively related to the PL and its contribution ratio to the PL is 5 to 22% when the differential path length factor is 6. Most of the signal attributed to the brain comes from the upper 1 to 2 mm of the cortical surface.

The peak skin dose to the head of the operator with LA was 2.1 times higher (3380 vs 1600 muSv), while the thyroid was 13.9 (4460 vs 320 muSv), the mediastinum infinitely (520 vs 0 muSv), and the foot 3.3 times higher (4870 vs 1470 muSv) compared with the ZG operator, leading to an overall accumulated dose 4 times higher. The ratio of cumulative operator received dose/total cumulative DAP was 2.5 higher on the LA operator.CONCLUSIONS: The ZG radiation protection system leads to substantially lower radiation exposure to the operator in neurointerventional procedures. However, substantial exposure may still occur at the level of the lens and thyroid to justify additional protection.",Excluded

2318,"Short and long-term evaluation of the impact of proton minibeam radiation therapy on motor, emotional and cognitive functions. Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most frequently used methods for cancer treatment. Despite remarkable advancements in RT techniquesthe treatment of radioresistant tumours (i.e. high-grade gliomas) is not yet satisfactory. Finding novel approaches less damaging for normal tissues is of utmost importance. This would make it possible to increase the dose applied to tumours, resulting in an improvement in the cure rate. Along this line, proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) is a novel strategy that allows the spatial modulation of the dose, leading to minimal damage to brain structures compared to a high dose (25 Gy in one fraction) of standard proton therapy (PT). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether pMBRT also preserves important cerebral functions. Comprehensive longitudinal behavioural studies were performed in irradiated (peak dose of 57 Gy in one fraction) and control rats to evaluate the impact of pMBRT on motor function (motor coordination, muscular tonus, and locomotor activity), emotional function (anxiety, fear, motivation, and impulsivity), and cognitive function (learning, memory, temporal processing, and decision making). The evaluations, which were conducted over a period of 10 months, showed no significant motor or emotional dysfunction in pMBRT-irradiated rats compared with control animals. Concerning cognitive functions, similar performance was observed between the groups, although some slight learning delays might be present in some of the tests in the long term after irradiation. This study shows the minimal impact of pMBRT on the normal brain at the functional level.",Included
2314,"Mapping by laser photostimulation of connections between the thalamic reticular and ventral posterior lateral nuclei in the rat. We used laser scanning photostimulation through a focused UV laser of caged glutamate in an in vitro slice preparation through the rat's somatosensory thalamus to study topography and connectivity between the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral posterior lateral nucleus. This enabled us to focally stimulate the soma or dendrites of reticular neurons. We were thus able to confirm and extend previous observations based mainly on neuroanatomical pathway tracing techniques: the projections from the thalamic reticular nucleus to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus have precise topography. The reticular zone, which we refer to as a ""footprint,"" within which photostimulation evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in relay cells, was relatively small and oval, with the long axis being parallel to the border between the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral posterior lateral nucleus. These evoked IPSCs were large, and by using appropriate GABA antagonists, we were able to show both GABA(A) and GABA(B) components. This suggests that photostimulation strongly activated reticular neurons. Finally, we were able to activate a disynaptic relay cell-to-reticular-to- relay cell pathway by evoking IPSCs in relay cells from photostimulation of the region surrounding a recorded relay cell. This, too, suggests strong responses of relay cells, responses strong enough to evoke spiking in their postsynaptic reticular targets. The regions of photostimulation for these disynaptic responses were much larger than the above-mentioned reticular footprints, and this suggests that reticulothalamic axon arbors are less widespread than thalamoreticular arbors, that there is more convergence in thalamoreticular connections than in reticulothalamic connections, or both.",Excluded
1769,"Intraocular gene transfer of pigment epithelium-derived factor rescues photoreceptors from light-induced cell death. In this study, we investigated whether intraocular gene transfer of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) ameliorates the extent of light-induced photoreceptor cell death. Lewis rats received intravitreous injection of 3 x 10(9) particles of adenoviral vector expressing PEDF (AdPEDF.11) in one eye and 3 x 10(9) particles of empty adenoviral vector (AdNull.11) in the contralateral eye. The rats were then dark-adapted for 3 days after which they were continuously exposed to fluorescent light (2,500 lux) for 0, 6, 24, 96, and 168 h. Both eyes were then enucleated and processed for morphometric analysis. Cell death in the retina was examined using TUNEL staining with a propidium iodide counterstain. The photoreceptor cell counts in each of the three groups were significantly different (P < 0.001). Eyes that received intravitreous injection of AdNull.11 or no injection showed a greater number of pyknotic photoreceptor cells and a reduced photoreceptor cell density as compared to eyes treated with intravitreous AdPEDF.11 injection. AdNull.11 treated eyes showed a lesser but still significant protection of photoreceptor cells when compared to untreated eyes. Fewer TUNEL-positive photoreceptor cells were present in AdPEDF.11 treated eyes than in AdNull.11 treated or untreated eyes (P = 0.004). The amplitudes of the ERG a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potentials (OPs) were increased significantly by treatment (P < 0.05). These data suggest that adenovirus vector-mediated intraocular expression of PEDF significantly increases photoreceptor cell survival following excessive light exposure. Neuroprotection may result from inhibition of light-induced apoptotic processes. This study provides proof of concept for a gene transfer approach to modulating retinal cell death resulting from photo-oxidative damage and supports the hypothesis that gene transfer of PEDF is broadly applicable to modulating apoptosis in the retina.",Excluded

Background: <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 is a novel radiotracer demonstrating high binding selectivity and affinity for tau over amyloid pathology and better pharmacokinetics in the brain than previous THK probes. Our aim was to estimate the radiation dose of <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 in human, and then compare the clinical radiation dosimetry results to estimations in previously published preclinical data. Method(s): Serial whole body PET/CT imaging was performed over 240 min on 7 healthy volunteers after injection of 377+/-18.6 MBq (range, 340.7 - 388.9 MBq) of <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351. The bladder and gallbladder were delineated from PET images, and other organs were delineated on CT images. Voided urine activity was recorded. The decay-corrected and normalized <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 activity of 15 source organ regions as a function of time was entered into the OLINDA/EXM software to calculate the effective dose of each subject following the medical internal radiation dosimetry schema.

The highest mean initial uptakes at 10 minutes post injection were measured in the liver (10.8%), lung (6.1%), kidney (1.5%), and brain (1.0%). The highest mean radiation absorbed doses were received by the gallbladder wall (211mGy/MBq), upper large intestine (93 mGy/MBq) and small intestine (82 mGy/MBq). The resultant whole-body effective dose was 22.0 mSv/MBq.

2298,"Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain caused by acute radiation injuries. Moderate to severe acute pain is a common consequence of fullcourse radiotherapy. Improved analgesics are needed, but therapeutic development requires an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie acute radiation-associated pain (RAP). Our preliminary data suggest that transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels on sensory neurons play important roles in RAP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of various Trp channels in acute RAP using a mouse model of oral radiation-induced mucositis. Mice underwent high dose single fraction lingual irradiation or sham irradiation. This resulted in glossitis that was most severe at 10-12 days postirradiation and resolved within 20 days. Micewere euthanized on days 1, 5, 11, 21, and 45 post-irradiation. Functional analysis of trigeminal ganglia neurons was assessed via calcium imaging; this revealed significantly increased proportions of neurons that were sensitive to capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist), histamine (TRPV4 partial agonist), or TNF-alpha (a general inflammatory marker). These changes were seen as early as 1-day post-irradiation and lasted until the 21st day. Via quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy, we documented Trpv1 overexpression in the trigeminal ganglia neurons of tongueirradiated mice on days 11 and 21. Together, these results indicate that both TRPV1 and TRPV4 are activated and upregulated, and contribute to the acute response of oral tissues to therapeutic irradiation. Thus, future studies should focus on assessing these two Trp channels as potential targets for RAP mitigation in human and animal cancer patients.",Included

The purpose of this study was to test the accuracy of the short-inhalation technique for estimating OEF in healthy human volunteers. Method(s): The final study population included 16 healthy volunteers, who underwent a series of dynamic PET scans consisting of short inhalation of <sup>15</sup>O-CO, short inhalation of <sup>15</sup>O-O <inf>2</inf>, and a bolus infusion of <sup>15</sup>O-H<inf>2</inf>O to generate parametric images for cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), OEF, and metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<inf>2</inf>). About 45 min before PET emission scanning, arterial and jugular blood was sampled through a catheter inserted in a radial artery and the right jugular bulb, respectively. PET-derived OEF (OEFpet) of the whole brain was compared with OEF calculated from the arteriovenous blood-sampling technique (OEFav). Result(s): Whole-brain-averaged CBF (mean +/- SD) measured with PET was 0.40 +/- 0.06 (range, 0.30-0.55) mL/g/min, CBV was 0.05 +/- 0.01 (range, 0.04-0.09) mL/g, CMRO<inf>2</inf> was 2.85 +/- 0.39 (range, 2.35-3.84) mL/100 g/min, and OEFpet was 0.39 +/- 0.06 (range, 0.30-0.51). OEFpet showed a slightly higher value than did OEFav (0.36 +/- 0.05 [range, 0.29-0.46]), but the difference was not significant.

2154,"Thoracic radiation-YES. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15%-20% of all lung cancers, and the overwhelming majority (>95%) are associated with tobacco exposure. The incidence of all types of lung cancer, including SCLC, has been declining in the United States with the onset of tobacco smoking cessation programs, although this trend took nearly 20 years to become evident among men. Overall survival (OS) rates for patients with lung cancer have also increased by about 5% since the advent of low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning to detect early lung cancer. The prognosis for patients with SCLC continues to be poor but has improved with the advent of smoking cessation campaigns, more effective chemotherapy agents and radiation planning and delivery techniques, and the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for those who experience a complete response to therapy. Consolidation with chest radiotherapy has improved OS among patients with extensive-stage SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. SCLC often presents as bulky symptomatic masses, and mediastinal involvement is common with or without pleural effusion and extrathoracic disease. Extrathoracic spread (i.e., extensive-stage disease) is also quite common, being present in 80%-85% of cases at diagnosis. Brain metastases are present in approximately 20% of patients at diagnosis; roughly half of these metastases are symptomatic and the other half are detected by imaging. Predictors of poor prognosis include poor performance status, older age, and being male. The pathologic subtypes of the disease (small cell carcinoma and combined small cell carcinoma) all carry a similarly poor prognosis. Current guidelines of the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend the use of positron emission tomography (PET), CT scanning, or fused PET/CT scanning of the chest, liver, adrenals, bone, and other areas of concern in the diagnosis and staging of SCLC (NCCN guideline-SCLC 2017). Thoracic radiotherapy has also become important for improving OS among patients with SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. In one prospectively randomized study of 498 patients with extensive-stage SCLC (WHO performance status score 0-2) who achieved complete response to chemotherapy, patients who received consolidation thoracic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) had significantly better 2-year OS rates than did those who did not receive thoracic radiotherapy (13% vs. 3%, P=0.004). Thoracic radiotherapy further improved thoracic-only failure rates (19.8% vs. 46% without, P=0.001) (Slotman B et al, Lancet Oncol 2015;385:36- 42). However, many patients with extensive-stage SCLC do not respond to the standard etoposide/cisplatin chemotherapy (Fig 1). Those patients may need to receive molecular-targeted therapies or immunotherapy with the consolidating thoracic radiotherapy. Several histologic and immunohistochemical markers have been evaluated for diagnosing or monitoring treatment response in SCLC, including transcription thyroid factor-1 (positive in >85% of SCLC cases); cytokeratin 7; deletions in chromosome 3; Leu-7; chromogranin A; synaptophysin; myc amplification; and p53 mutations (present in ~75% of cases). Deletions in tumor-suppressor genes are also relatively common and include fragile histidine triad (FHIT) (80%); RAS effector homologue (RASSF1) (>90%); TP53 (>75%); retinoblastoma- 1 (RB1) (>90%); and retinoic acid receptor-beta (72%). However, to date no biomarkers have been validated for use in diagnosing SCLC. Moreover, mutations that are often present in non-small cell lung cancer (such as epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]) are rare in SCLC. Several clinicopathologic features have been linked with worse prognosis, including poor performance status, significant weight loss, high lactate dehydrogenase levels, large numbers of metastatic sites, and the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes. Because SCLC has the among the highest rates of somatic driver mutations, and because more than 95% of patie ts with SCLC are former or current smokers, immunotherapy seems a reasonable approach, as high mutation burdens correlate with good response to chemoradiotherapy and sensitivity to immunomodulators (Peifer M et al., Nat Genet 2012;44(10):1104-10). At MD Anderson Cancer Center, an ongoing phase I/II study of patients with extensive-stage SCLC has been proposed to the NRG as a prospective randomized study (PI J Welsh) (Fig 2). Use of thoracic radiotherapy to consolidate a site at which SCLC is quite likely to recur is reasonable, given that recurrence considerably reduces quality of their life as well as OS. In summary, in most cases SCLC presents as extensive-stage disease, for which outcomes are very poor. Consolidation with thoracic radiotherapy for patients who achieve a complete response to chemotherapy can improve 2-year OS rates. However, less toxic and more effective systemic treatment is also required to derive the greatest benefit from consolidation thoracic radiotherapy.",Excluded

Also, lipid peroxidation as malondialdehyde (MDA) and metallothionein (MT) levels were measured in liver, kidney and testis. Rats were exposed to total dose of 0.03Gy gamma-rays along 12h at a low dose rate (2.5mGy/h). The results obtained manifested elevation in all essential metals studied in liver. All organs showed elevated Ca levels except that of brain with non-significant change in intestine. Decrease in Fe levels were observed in kidney, testis, intestine, heart and brain tissues with insignificant change in spleen tissue. Elevation in MDA in liver and kidney tissues was recorded and an inhibition in MT in liver, kidney and testis tissues was demonstrated. In conclusion, the previous essential metals tested are very sensitive to low dose (0.03Gy) gamma-rays.

1324,"Aberrant regulation of interleukin-2 but not of interferon-gamma gene expression in Down syndrome (trisomy 21). The regulated expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) genes was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 29 noninstitutionalized Down syndrome individuals and compared to that of 32 normal donors. Culture conditions were chosen that measure the transient, phytohemagglutinin-induced expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA, as well as the intactness of post-transcriptional and suppressor T cell-dependent mechanisms that control this expression. The latter was achieved by analyzing, respectively, the superinduction of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA occurring upon culture with cycloheximide or after low-dose gamma-irradiation. A convenient, sensitive, and quantitative assay for specific mRNA was devised, suitable for measuring mRNA levels expressed in cells from 1 ml of peripheral blood. Analysis of individuals with Down syndrome revealed a pronounced decrease in inducibility of the IL-2 gene. By contrast, induction of IFN-gamma mRNA was as vigorous as that observed for normal donors. In cells from trisomic subjects, superinduction of IFN-gamma mRNA by cycloheximide was at least as extensive as for normal donors, while in the case of IL-2 mRNA, it was weaker. These abnormal patterns of IL-2 gene expression were seen irrespective of age. Our findings demonstrate a selective impairment of IL-2 gene expression in Down syndrome, rather than a general deficiency in helper T cells.",Excluded

Blood samples during the test were collected via cannula inserted into cubital vein, centrifuged in the special appliance Plasma-03, frozen in Kryogem-03, and at the end of the 8-day space flight transferred to Earth in special container for hormonal analysis. Insulin hypoglycemia was induced by i.v. administration of 0.1 IU/kg BW insulin (Actrapid HM) in bolus. Insulin administration led to a comparable hypoglycemia in pre-flight, in-flight conditions and before and after bed rest. ITT led to a pronounced increase in EPI levels and moderate increase in NE in pre-flight studies. However, an evidently reduced EPI response was found after insulin administration during SF and during BR. Thus, during the real microgravity in SF and simulated microgravity in BR, insulin-induced hypoglycemia activates the adrenomedullary system to less extent than at conditions of the Earth gravitation. Post-flight changes in EPI and NE levels did not significantly differ from those of pre-flight since SF was relatively short (8 days) and the readaptation to Earth gravitation was fast. It seems, that an increased blood flow in brain might be responsible for the reduced EPI response to insulin. Responses to ITT in physically fit subjects indicate the stimulus specificity of deconditioning effect of 5 days bed rest on stress response. Thus, the data indicate that catecholamine responses to ITT are reduced after exposure to real as well as simulated microgravity.",Excluded

ILC3s and neuronal cells have been shown to interact at discrete mucosal locations to steer mucosal defence<sup>2,3</sup>. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether neuroimmune circuits operate at an organismal level, integrating extrinsic environmental signals to orchestrate ILC3 responses. Here we show that light-entrained and brain-tuned circadian circuits regulate enteric ILC3s, intestinal homeostasis, gut defence and host lipid metabolism in mice. We found that enteric ILC3s display circadian expression of clock genes and ILC3-related transcription factors. ILC3-autonomous ablation of the circadian regulator Arntl led to disrupted gut ILC3 homeostasis, impaired epithelial reactivity, a deregulated microbiome, increased susceptibility to bowel infection and disrupted lipid metabolism. Loss of ILC3-intrinsic Arntl shaped the gut 'postcode receptors' of ILC3s. Strikingly, light-dark cycles, feeding rhythms and microbial cues differentially regulated ILC3 clocks, with light signals being the major entraining cues of ILC3s. Accordingly, surgically or genetically induced deregulation of brain rhythmicity led to disrupted circadian ILC3 oscillations, a deregulated microbiome and altered lipid metabolism. Our work reveals a circadian circuitry that translates environmental light cues into enteric ILC3s, shaping intestinal health, metabolism and organismal homeostasis.",Excluded

The effects of S 24795, a newly developed partial agonist at alpha7 nAChRs, were tested on synaptic transmission and plasticity using extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked in the CA1 region by Schaffer collateral stimulation in hippocampal slices obtained from adult mice. S 24795 reduced the amplitude of the fEPSPs in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) of 127 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1.1. The reduction in amplitude of the fEPSPs started at S 24795 concentrations higher than 3muM and reached 71% of controls at 300 microM. This effect was mediated by alpha7 nAChRs since it was blocked by nAChR antagonists and was not observed in alpha7 -/- mice. This effect was probably due to a reduction in glutamate release from presynaptic terminals since it was associated with a significant increase in the paired pulse ratio. In addition, S 24795 (100 microM) significantly reduced the frequency, but not the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, recorded in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (in voltage clamp mode), further supporting a presynaptic site of action of S 24795. In addition, S 24795 at 3 microM, a concentration that did not affect basic synaptic transmission, potentiated LTP. This effect was mediated by alpha7 nAChRs since it was prevented by MLA (10 nM) and was absent in alpha7 -/- mice. Galantamine an allosteric modulator of nAChRs, at the concentrations of 0.3-3 microM, failed to potentiate LTP.

Purpose: Radiotherapy became an important component in the treatment of brain gliomas. The aim of this study is to analyse several advantages of the three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy in comparison with a two- dimensional conventional technique and to present the clinical results of 43 patients with brain gliomas treated according to a three-dimensional planning. Patients and Method: Between January 1994 and December 1995, 43 Patients with malignant brain gliomas (WHO III and IV) were treated in our department according to a three-dimensional treatment planning. The patients received a total irradiation dose of 60 Gy, 2 Gy/day, 5 days/week. The rate of survival was analysed in relation with the known prognostical factors: histology, Karnofsky index, age, resection status. In 10 patients a three- dimensional treatment planning was compared with a conventional two- dimensional planning: the volume of the normal brain tissue irradiated to high dose levels (95% isodose) and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the brain by Kutcher and Lyman were comparatively analysed. Result(s): The survival rate for the whole group was 14 months. The histology of the tumor, age, Karnofsky index and resection status were important prognostical factors. The three-dimensional planning allows a 15 to 20% reduction in the volume of normal brain tissue irradiated to high dose levels (95% isodose). The NTCP is significantly lower using the three-dimensional technique (range 0.03% to 13%), in comparison with the two-dimensional conventional technique (range 0.1% to 26%). The value of NTCP increases with tumor volume. Conclusion(s): Concerning the tumor control and survival rate, the three-dimensional treatment planning shows no advantages compared to the standard conventional methods. The main advantage of the three-dimensional treatment planning is the possibility to spare normal brain tissue. This should enable a dose escalation in the tumor, with a minimal risk of side effects in the surrounding normal tissue.

2271,"Quantitative analysis of conebeam CT for delineating stents in stent-assisted coil embolization. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Innovative techniques and device-related advances have improved the outcomes of neuroendovascular treatment. 3D imaging has previously used 2 < 2 binning, but 1 < 1 binning has recently been made available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative ability of conebeam CT for stent delineation and to investigate its effectiveness in the clinical environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four acquisition groups of 3D MIP images acquired using conebeam CT with varying conditions (acquisition time, 10 or 20 seconds and binning, 1 < 1 or 2 < 2) were compared. Two methods of analysis were performed, a phantom study and an analysis of 28 randomly selected patients. The phantom study assessed the contrast-to-noise ratio and full width at half maximum values in conebeam CT images of intracranial stent struts. In the clinical subjects, we assessed contrast-to-noise ratio, full width at half maximum, and dose-area product. RESULT(S): In the phantom study, the contrast-to-noise ratio was not considerably different between 10- and 20-second acquisition times at equivalent binning settings. Additionally, the contrast-to-noise ratio at equivalent acquisition times did not differ considerably by binning setting. For the full width at half maximum results, equivalent acquisition times differed significantly by binning setting. In the clinical analyses, the 10-second/1 < 1 group (versus 20 second/2 < 2) showed a higher contrast-to-noise ratio (P .05) and a dose-area product reduced by approximately 70% (P .05), but the difference in full width at half maximum was not significant (P<.20). CONCLUSION(S): For stent-assisted coil embolization, quantitative assessment of conebeam CT showed that 10 second/1 < 1 was equivalent to 20 second/2 < 2 for imaging deployed intracranial stents. Furthermore, the 10-second/1 < 1 settings resulted in a much smaller DAP. Copyright © 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Moreover, we evaluated the relationship between the protective effects of the lens and the transmittance of lens at 464 nm. Lenses of six colors, except for the SY, PN, and reflective coating lenses, strongly decreased the reduction in cell damage induced by blue LED light exposure. The deep yellow lens showed the most protective effect from all the lenses, but the reflective coating lens and pink lens did not show any effects on photoreceptor-derived cell damage. Moreover, these results were correlated with the lens transmittance of blue LED light (464 nm). These results suggest that lenses of various colors, especially deep yellow lenses, may protect retinal photoreceptor cells from blue LED light in proportion to the transmittance for the wavelength of blue LED and the suppression of reactive oxygen species production and cell damage.",Excluded
2345,"Repair and mutagenesis at oxidized DNA lesions in the developing brain of wild-type and Ogg1-/- mice. OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1) is one of the main DNA glycosylases present in mammalian cells. The enzyme removes 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions, believed to be the most important oxidized lesions due to their relatively high incidence and their miscoding properties. This study shows that in prenatal mice brains the repair capacity for 8-oxoG is 5-10-fold higher than in adult mice brains. Western blot analysis and repair activity in extracts from Ogg1(-/-) mice revealed that OGG1 was responsible for the efficient 8-oxoG removal from prenatal mice. To investigate how OGG1 protects against oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis, pregnant Big Blue/wild-type and Big Blue/Ogg1(-/-) mice were exposed to nontoxic doses of gamma radiation. A 2.5-fold increase in the mutation frequency in Ogg1(-/-) mouse brains was obtained by exposure to 3.5 Gy at day 19 postfertilization. This was largely due to GC to TA transversions, believed to originate from 8-oxoG mispairing with A during replication. Furthermore, rapid cell divisions seemed to be required for fixation of mutations, as a similar dose of radiation did not increase the mutation frequency, or the frequency of GC to TA transversion, in the adult brain.",Excluded

1417,"An exploration of the factor structure and development of potentially useful subscales of etiological beliefs about schizophrenia in a general population sample. Background: Given that accessing care, treatment engagement, and course and outcomes among people with schizophrenia may be influenced by beliefs about causes in the larger community, causal beliefs about schizophrenia have been studied in numerous communities around the world. In particular, the 30-item list of etiological attributions developed by Angermeyer and colleagues has been used to describe causal beliefs in patients, family members, and lay community members within such communities. The current study, the first examination of the latent or factorial structure of these 30 causal beliefs, seeks to provide informative subscales that may enhance reliability and validity of groupings of causes for future analyses involving community members. Method(s): Data were gathered from six separate surveys involving three distinct groups of individuals from the same community within the southeastern United States: lay community members, relatives of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and police officers at the start of a 1-week mental health training program. Result(s): Exploratory factor analysis in the overall sample (n = 577) revealed four factors that were used to define four subscales, termed: personal/family/social stressors (14 items), inconsistent with modern conceptions of risk (8 items), external/environmental insults to the brain (6 items), and consistent with modern biological conceptions (2 items). Cronbach's internal consistency reliability coefficients for these subscales were 0.91, 0.83, 0.71, and 0.65, respectively. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that subscales could be derived to provide continuous measures for assessing causal beliefs in order to study how this concept relates to attitudes toward schizophrenia, the people affected by the disorder, and treatments that are recommended by mental health professionals.

1700,"11C-methionine-PET for differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis: radiomics approach with random forest classifier. Differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis is often difficult. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of 11C-methionine (MET)-PET radiomics for distinguishing recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, as compared with conventional tumor-to-normal cortex (T/N) ratio evaluation. We enrolled 41 patients with metastatic brain tumor or glioma treated using radiation therapy who underwent MET-PET. The area with a standardized uptake value > 1.3 times that of the normal brain cortex was contoured. Forty-two PET features were extracted and used in a random forest classifier and the diagnostic performance was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Gini index was measured to identify relevant PET parameters for classification. The reference standard was surgical histopathological analysis or more than 6 months of follow-up with MRI. Forty-four lesions were used for the analysis. Thirty-three and 11 lesions were confirmed as recurrent brain tumor and radiation necrosis, respectively. Radiomics and T/N ratio evaluation showed sensitivities of 90.1% and 60.6%, and specificities of 93.9% and 72.7% with areas under the curve of 0.98 and 0.73, respectively. Gray level co-occurrence matrix dissimilarity was the most pertinent feature for diagnosis. MET-PET radiomics yielded excellent outcome for differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, which outperformed T/N ratio evaluation.",Excluded
1444,"Driver or coincidence detector: modal switch of a corticothalamic giant synapse controlled by spontaneous activity and short-term depression. Giant synapses between layer 5B (L5B) neurons of somatosensory (barrel) cortex and neurons of the posteromedial nucleus (POm) of thalamus reside in a key position of the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loop, yet their synaptic properties and contribution to CTC information processing remain poorly understood. Fluorescence-guided local stimulation of terminals were combined with postsynaptic whole-cell recordings in thalamus to study synaptic transmission at an identified giant synapse. We found large EPSCs mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and NMDA receptors. A single presynaptic electrical stimulus evoked a train of postsynaptic action potentials, indicating that a single L5B input can effectively drive the thalamic neuron. Repetitive stimulation caused strong short-term depression (STD) with fast recovery. To examine how these synaptic properties affect information transfer, spontaneous and evoked activity of L5B neurons was recorded in vivo and played back to giant terminals in vitro. We found that suprathreshold synaptic transmission was suppressed because of spontaneous activity causing strong STD of the L5B-POm giant synapse. Thalamic neurons only spiked after intervals of presynaptic silence or when costimulating two giant terminals. Therefore, STD caused by spontaneous activity of L5B neurons can switch the synapse from a ""driver mode"" to a ""coincidence mode."" Mechanisms decreasing spontaneous activity in L5B neurons and inputs synchronized by a sensory stimulus may thus gate the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop.",Excluded
1346,"Influence of surface pattern and sterilisation of solvent-cast films for peripheral nerve guidance. INTRODUCTION : Damage to peripheral nerves can result in considerable morbidity and loss of function. Poly-(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and PCL/poly-(D,L-lactic acid) (PLA) blend nerve guidance conduits are a promising alternative to autologous nerve grafts in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury1. The surface morphology of scaffolds is known to influence their physical properties and cell behaviour. Yet, as scaffolds progress further towards clinical trials, it is imperative that they are subjected to/and capable of withstanding approved sterilisation methods, such as gamma irradiation, without causing detrimental effects to the material physical properties and/or cell response. This study investigates how surface patterns affect PCL films and aims to assess whether PCL/PLA blend scaffolds are able to withstand gamma irradiation sufficient for medical sterilisation. METHOD(S): PCL and PCL/PLA (4:1 w/w) blend solutions were prepared using dichloromethane (3% w/v). Smooth, pitted and micro-grooved PCL films were cast and imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while tensile testing was used to quantify their mechanical properties (Instron 1122, load cell 0.010 kN). NG108-15 cells were cultured up to 14 days on the various PCL film surfaces before fluorescence and SEM imaging were performed both to confirm biocompatibility and observe cell behaviour. PCL/PLA blend films will be sterilised at 7 incremental doses of gamma radiation (15-45 kGy) (Isotron). Mechanical testing, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography will be utilised to evaluate any changes in material properties or structure in comparison to unirradiated control samples. RESULT(S): The mean thickness of all types of solvent-cast film was less than 100 mum. The average porosity of the pitted PCL films was 53% with 2.1+/-0.5 mum diameter pits. Smooth films were significantly stronger, with greater modulus and strain (Table 1*p<0.01). NG108-15 cells attached and proliferated on the PCL films in vitro up to 14 days. However, only on the grooved samples did cells display organisation, demonstrating alignment in the same orientation as the grooves (Fig. 1). (Table presented) Discussion & CONCLUSION(S): These findings support the use of solvent cast PCL films for fabricating nerve guides. Pits in the surface of the inner lumen are beneficial in cell growth and grooved surfaces enable the alignment of neurons. In this work all patterned surfaces had sufficient tensile strength to function as nerve conduits. PCL/PLA blended films were tested to see whether they would withstand medical-grade sterilisation. It is hypothesised that the polymer films will not be significantly affected by gamma irradiation.",Excluded
1856,"Re-irradiation of adenoid cystic carcinoma: analysis and evaluation of outcome in 52 consecutive patients treated with raster-scanned carbon ion therapy. BACKGROUND: Treatment of local relapse in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) following prior radiation remains a challenge: without the possibility of surgical salvage patients face the choice between palliative chemotherapy and re-irradiation. Chemotherapy yields response rates around 30% and application of tumouricidal doses is difficult due to proximity of critical structures. Carbon ion therapy (C12) is a promising method to minimize side-effects and maximize re-treatment dose in this indication. We describe our initial results for re-irradiation in heavily pre-treated ACC patients.METHODS: Patients treated with carbon ion therapy between 04/2010 and 05/2013 (N=52pts, median age: 54 a) were retrospectively evaluated regarding toxicity (NCI CTC v.4), tumour response (RECIST) and control rates. 48pts (92.3%) received carbon ions only, 4pts received IMRT plus C12.RESULTS: 4pts were treated following R1-resection, 43pts for inoperable local relapse. Most common tumour sites were paranasal sinus (36.5%), parotid (19.2%), and base of skull (17.3%). Pts received a median dose of 51GyE C12/63Gy BED and cumulative dose of 128Gy BED [67-182Gy] after a median RT-interval of 61months. Median target volume was 93ml [9-618ml]. No higher-grade (>degreeII) acute reactions were observed, 7pts showed blood-brain-barrier changes (degreeI/II: 8pts; degreeIII: 2pts), 1 pt corneal ulceration, xerophthalmia 7pts, degreeIV bleeding 1 pt, tissue necrosis 2pts, otherwise no significant late reactions. Objective response rate (CR/PR) was 56.6%. With a median follow-up of 14months [1-39months] local control and distant control at 1a are 70.3% and 72.6% respectively. Of the 18pts with local relapse, 13pts have recurred in-field, 1 pt at the field edge, 3pts out of field, and one in the dose gradient.CONCLUSION: Despite high applied doses, C12 re-irradiation shows moderate side-effects, response rates even in these heavily pre-treated patients are encouraging and present a good alternative to palliative chemotherapy. Though most local recurrences occur within the high-dose area, further dose escalation should be viewed with caution.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To identify the effects of NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B expression in rat's hippocampus after exposure to 1800 MHz radiofrequency radiation.METHODS: Four-week old female Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups, with 12 animals for each. The subjects in two experimental groups had been continuously exposed to 1800 MHz microwave radiation (CW) with respective power density of 0.5 mW/cm(2) and 1.0 mW/cm(2) 12 hours each day for 21 days. Meanwhile, sham-controls were carried out. The brain tissue sections were performed by immunohistochemistry to demonstrate both expressions of NR2A, NR2B immune-activity in the hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG by using computer-assisted image analysis system.RESULTS: In NR2A: the expression of 0.5 mW/cm(2) power density group was significantly lower than 0 mW/cm(2) power density group in CA3 [(8.5 +/- 1.5) vs (11.1 +/- 1.8), P < 0.01] and had not been significantly changed in CA1 and DG.

1950,"Predictors of hearing preservation after stereotactic radiosurgery for acoustic neuroma. OBJECT: Many patients with acoustic neuromas (ANs) have hearing function at diagnosis and desire to maintain it. To date, radiosurgical techniques have been focused on conformal irradiation of the tumor mass, with less attention to inner ear structures for which there was scant radiobiological information. The authors of this study evaluated tumor control and hearing preservation as they relate to tumor volume, imaging characteristics, and nerve and cochlear radiation dose following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using the Gamma Knife.METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with ANs had serviceable hearing (Gardner-Robertson [GR] Class I or II) and underwent SRS between 2004 and 2007. This interval reflected more recent measurements of inner ear dosimetry during the authors' 21-year experience. The median patient age was 52 years (range 22-82 years). No patient had undergone any prior treatment for the ANs. The median tumor volume was 0.75 cm(3) (range 0.07-7.7 cm(3)), and the median radiation dose to the tumor margin was 12.5 Gy (range 12-13 Gy). At diagnosis, a greater distance from the lateral tumor to the end of the internal auditory canal correlated with better hearing function.RESULTS: At a median of 20 months after SRS, no patient required any other additional treatment. Serviceable hearing was preserved in 71% of all patients and in 89% (46 patients) of those with GR Class I hearing. Significant prognostic factors for maintaining the same GR class included (all pre-SRS) GR Class I hearing, a speech discrimination score (SDS) >or= 80%, a pure tone average (PTA) < 20 dB, and a patient age < 60 years. Significant prognostic factors for serviceable hearing preservation were (all pre-SRS) GR Class I hearing, an SDS >or= 80%, a PTA < 20 dB, a patient age < 60 years, an intracanalicular tumor location, and a tumor volume < 0.75 cm(3). Patients who received a radiation dose of < 4.2 Gy to the central cochlea had significantly better hearing preservation of the same GR class. Twelve of 12 patients < 60 years of age who had received a cochlear dose < 4.2 Gy retained serviceable hearing at 2 years post-SRS.CONCLUSIONS: As currently practiced, SRS with the Gamma Knife preserves serviceable hearing in the majority of patients. Tumor volume and anatomy relate to the hearing level before radiosurgery and influence technique. A low radiosurgical dose to the cochlea enhances hearing preservation.",Excluded

Exposure to verapamil (0.1 to 10 microM) significantly increased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the electrically-evoked overflow of tritium, without affecting the spontaneous outflow of radioactivity. 2 Exposure to diltiazem in concentrations up to 100 microM had no effect on the electrically evoked release of [3H]-noradrenaline, but increased the basal outflow of radioactivity at 10 and 100 microM. 3 The preferential alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.1 microM) significantly antagonized the inhibitory effect of clonidine or adrenaline on [3H]-noradrenaline overflow elicited by electrical stimulation. Verapamil (3 microM) also antagonized this inhibitory effect of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists on [3H]-noradrenaline release. In contrast to these results, exposure to diltiazem (10 microM) was ineffective in blocking the action of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. 4 These results suggest that the two Ca2+-antagonists verapamil and diltiazem differ in their ability to affect central noradrenergic neurotransmission. While verapamil is a relatively potent alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, diltiazem is devoid of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist properties.",Excluded

Using new collecting techniques with the Johnson-Sea-Link submersible, eight species of deep-sea benthic crustaceans were collected with intact visual systems. Their spectral sensitivities and temporal resolutions were determined shipboard using electroretinography. Useable spectral sensitivity data were obtained from seven species, and in the dark-adapted eyes, the spectral sensitivity peaks were in the blue region of the visible spectrum, ranging from 470 to 497 nm. Under blue chromatic adaptation, a secondary sensitivity peak in the UV portion of the spectrum appeared for two species of anomuran crabs: Eumunida picta (lambda(max)363 nm) and Gastroptychus spinifer (lambda(max)383 nm). Wavelength-specific differences in response waveforms under blue chromatic adaptation in these two species suggest that two populations of photoreceptor cells are present. Temporal resolution was determined in all eight species using the maximum critical flicker frequency (CFF(max)). The CFF(max) for the isopod Booralana tricarinata of 4 Hz proved to be the lowest ever measured using this technique, and suggests that this species is not able to track even slow-moving prey.

1464,"Impact of concomitant systemic treatments on toxicity and intracerebral response after stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in combination with systemic therapies (ST) for brain metastases (BM).METHODS: Ninety-nine patients (171 BM) received SRT and concurrent ST (group 1) and 95 patients (131 BM) received SRT alone without concurrent ST (group 2). SRT was planned on a linear accelerator, using volumetric modulated arc therapy. All ST were allowed including chemotherapy (CT), immunotherapy (IT), targeted therapy (TT) and hormonotherapy (HT). Treatment was considered to be concurrent if the timing between the drug administration and SRT did not exceed 1 month. Local control (LC), freedom for distant brain metastases (FFDBM), overall survival (OS) and radionecrosis (RN) were evaluated.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11.9 months (range 0.7-29.7), there was no significant difference between the two groups. However, patients who received concurrent IT (n = 30) had better 1-year LC, OS, FFDBM but a higher RN rate compared to patients who did not: 96% versus 78% (p = 0.02), 89% versus 77% (p = 0.02), 76% versus 53% (p = 0.004) and 80% versus 90% (p = 0.03), respectively. In multivariate analysis, concurrent IT (p = 0.022) and tumor volume < 2.07 cc (p = 0.039) were significantly correlated with improvement of LC. The addition of IT to SRT compared to SRT alone was associated with an increased risk of RN (p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: SRT delivered concurrently with IT seems to be associated with improved LC, FFDBM and OS as well as with a higher rate of RN.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCHT) improves survival of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. Conventional three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to a significant amount of the left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) provides excellent target coverage with improved kidney sparing. Few long-term results on IMRT for gastric cancer, however, have been published. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3.0 T including blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and, for the first time, (23)Na imaging was used to evaluate renal status after radiotherapy with 3D-CRT or IG-IMRT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four disease-free patients (2 after 3D-CRT and 2 after IMRT; FU for all patients > 5 years) were included in this feasibility study. Morphological sequences, axial DWI images, 2D-gradient echo (GRE)-BOLD images, and (23)Na images were acquired. Mean values/standard deviations for ((23)Na), the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and R2* values were calculated for the upper/middle/lower parts of both kidneys. Corticomedullary (23)Na-concentration gradients were determined.RESULTS: Surprisingly, IG-IMRT patients showed no morphological alterations and no statistically significant differences of ADC and R2* values in all renal parts. Values for mean corticomedullary (23)Na-concentration matched those for healthy volunteers. Results were similar in 3D-CRT patients, except for the cranial part of the left kidney. This was atrophic and presented significantly reduced functional parameters (p = 0.001-p = 0.033). Reduced ADC values indicated reduced cell density and reduced extracellular space. Cortical and medullary R2* values of the left cranial kidney in the 3D-CRT group were higher, indicating more deoxygenated hemoglobin due to reduced blood flow/oxygenation. ((23)Na) of the renal cranial parts in the 3D-CRT group was significantly reduced, while the expected corticomedullary (23)Na-concentration gradient was partially conserved.CONCLUSIONS: Functional MRI can assess postradiotherapeutic renal changes. As expected, marked morphological/functional effects were observed in high-dose areas (3D-CRT), while, unexpectedly, no alteration in kidney function was observed in IG-IMRT patients, supporting the hypothesis that reducing total/fractional dose to the renal parenchyma by IMRT is clinically beneficial.",Excluded

The courtship ritual of male Drosophila represents an innate behaviour that is initiated by female-derived sensory stimuli. Here we report that moving light spots can induce courtship-like following pursuit in tethered wild-type male flies provided the fly is primed by optogenetic stimulation of specific dsx-expressing neuronal clusters in the lateral protocerebrum (LPR). Namely, stimulation of the pC1 neuronal cluster initiates unilateral wing extension and vibration of both sides, whereas stimulation of the pC2l cluster initiates only contralateral wing displays. In addition, stimulation of pC2l but not pC1 neurons induced abdominal bending and proboscis extension. Ca(2+) imaging of the pC1 cluster revealed periodic Ca(2+) rises, each corresponding to a turn of the male fly during courtship. In contrast, group-reared fru mutant males exhibit light spot-induced courtship pursuit without optogenetic priming.

2020,"Systemic HDAC3 inhibition ameliorates impairments in synaptic plasticity caused by simulated galactic cosmic radiation exposure in male mice. Deep space travel presents a number of measurable risks including exposure to a spectrum of radiations of varying qualities, termed galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) that are capable of penetrating the spacecraft, traversing through the body and impacting brain function. Using rodents, studies have reported that exposure to simulated GCR leads to cognitive impairments associated with changes in hippocampus function that can persist as long as one-year post exposure with no sign of recovery. Whether memory can be updated to incorporate new information in mice exposed to GCR is unknown. Further, mechanisms underlying long lasting impairments in cognitive function as a result of GCR exposure have yet to be defined. Here, we examined whether whole body exposure to simulated GCR using 6 ions and doses of 5 or 30 cGy interfered with the ability to update an existing memory or impact hippocampal synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism believed to underlie memory processes, by examining long term potentiation (LTP) in acute hippocampal slices from middle aged male mice 3.5-5 months after radiation exposure. Using a modified version of the hippocampus-dependent object location memory task developed by our lab termed ""Objects in Updated Locations"" (OUL) task we find that GCR exposure impaired hippocampus-dependent memory updating and hippocampal LTP 3.5-5 months after exposure. Further, we find that impairments in LTP are reversed through one-time systemic subcutaneous injection of the histone deacetylase 3 inhibitor RGFP 966 (10 mg/kg), suggesting that long lasting impairments in cognitive function may be mediated at least in part, through epigenetic mechanisms.",Included

1607,"Space motion sickness: incidence, etiology, and countermeasures. Space motion sickness is experienced by 60% to 80% of space travelers during their first 2 to 3 days in microgravity and by a similar proportion during their first few days after return to Earth. Space motion sickness symptoms are similar to those in other forms of motion sickness; they include: pallor, increased body warmth, cold sweating, malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and anorexia. These are important because they may affect the operational performance of astronauts. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain space motion sickness: the fluid shift hypothesis and the sensory conflict hypothesis. The fluid shift hypothesis suggests that space motion sickness results from the cranial shifting of body fluids resulting from the loss of hydrostatic pressure gradients in the lower body when entering microgravity. The cranial fluid shifts lead to visible puffiness in the face, and are thought to increase the intracranial pressure, the cerebrospinal-fluid pressure or the inner ear fluid pressures, altering the response properties of the vestibular receptors and inducing space motion sickness. The sensory conflict hypothesis suggests that loss of tilt-related otolith signals upon entry into microgravity causes a conflict between actual and anticipated signals from sense organs subserving spatial orientation. Such sensory conflicts are thought to induce motion sickness in other environments. Space motion sickness is usually treated using pharmaceuticals, most of which have undesirable side effects. Further studies elucidating the underlying mechanism for space motion sickness may be required for developing new treatments. [References: 19]",Excluded

Acute X irradiation of the metacerebral giant neurons of Helix pomatia above 1000 R or 3.4 kR/min (dose or dose rate threshold) leads to a significant reduction of the membrane potential. After blocking the afferent excitatory synapses the radiation depolarizations are strongly decreased but not completely suppressed. Long time irradiation at high dose rates and after the blocking of afferent synapses produced a depolarization in 2 phases: an immediate quick depolarization of about 10 mV is followed by a much slower decrease of the membrane potential. Substitution of extracellular sodium by tris ions suppresses the quick depolarization phase. The input resistance of the cell shows a transient increase at the begin of irradiation followed by a substantial decrease. These results are discussed in view of the possible mechanisms of radiation induced permeability changes in excitable membranes.,Included
1720,"Properties of paired-pulse firing thresholds and the relationship with paired-pulse plasticity in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. A large variability of paired-pulse plasticity (PPP) has been reported in CA3-CA1 synapses, and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) has long been extensively used as a relative index of release probability (P(r)) from the presynaptic terminal. One of the most common ways of studying P(r) and PPP is to pass paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) through an electrode to fire an action potential (AP), which in turn opens Ca(2+) channels in the presynaptic boutons to evoke transmitter release. However, when the postsynaptic responses were elicited by electrical stimulations, the presynaptic APs were usually not monitored. The reliability of presynaptic activation, the difference of AP firing thresholds between the first and the second pulses of PPS, and its relationship with P(r) and PPP have been largely ignored. Here we show that the AP firing thresholds in the same CA3 pyramidal cells (axons) are obviously lower for the second pulses of the PPS than for the first pulses. When single (or small numbers of) presynaptic axons were stimulated by low-intensity PPS, a large variation in the postsynaptic response probability of the first pulses (P(res1)) and PPP was observed. Increasing stimulation intensities resulted in the conversion of a lower P(res1) and PPF to a higher P(res1) and paired-pulse depression. These results indicate that changes in the reliability of AP initiation by the first pulse of the PPS may account for the high variability of P(res1) and PPP observed in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, therefore PPF may not be a reliable index of P(r) .",Excluded

Background: Annually, more than 4,000 patients are diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) from breast cancer in the U.S. Since most therapies cannot cross the Blood-CSF-Barrier (BCB) and the Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB), treatment options for LC are limited to local radiation and few chemotherapy agents, none of which have provided durable clinical benefit, leading to short overall survival (OS) of 3-4 months. ANG1005 is a novel peptide-drug conjugate, consisting of 3 paclitaxel molecules covalently linked to a peptide that targets the LRP-1 receptor to cross both BCB and BBB, and enter the tumor cells, where the paclitaxel is cleaved off to exert its anti-tumor activity. ANG1005 has previously shown in a phase 2 study to prolong OS in LC patients from breast cancer with brain metastases (BM) to 8 months. Trial Design: This is an open-label, multi-center phase 3 randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of ANG1005 in HER2-negative breast cancer patients with newly diagnosed LC and documented history of previously treated BM when compared to Physician Best Choice (PBC). Hundred and fifty (150) patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either ANG1005 experimental treatment or an Investigator assigned PBCcontrol treatment. ANG1005 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at a starting dose of 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks. Allowed PBC therapies include capecitabine, eribulin, or high-dose IV methotrexate. CNS disease (LC and BM) will be evaluated at screening and every 6 weeks by MRI, CSF cytology and neurological assessments according to LANO and RANO-BM criteria. Extracranial disease will be evaluated by CT scans according to RECIST at screening and every 6-12 weeks. All patients will be foliowed for survival every 6-8 weeks from the date of the last dose until death, lost to follow-up or consent withdrawal. Eligibility Criteria: Eligible patients are adults (E 18 years old) with HER2-negative breast cancer, newly diagnosed LC and documented history of previously treated BM. Patients must be neurologically stable and have adequate blood counts, organ and bone marrow function with an ECOG status grade 2. Patients previously treated with ANG1005 or with known allergy to paclitaxel or its components are excluded. Specific aims: The primary endpoint is OS. Secondary endpoints include CNS (LC and BM) progression-free survival and clinical benefit rate, 6-and 12-month OS rates, LC response rate and duration of response, OS for triple negative patients and safety. Statistical Methods: This study is sized for testing the hypothesis of improved OS for ANG1005 versus PBC in all patients (HR=0.58, two-sided test, overall type 1 error of 5%). Interim analysis for OS (using O'Brien Fleming boundaries for efficacy and a fixed HR=1 for futility) will be performed when a total of 55 death events are reached across both arms. Study Accrual: Target accrual is 150 patients. The study is currently planned to start in the fall of 2018.",Excluded
1398,"Spontaneous network activity in the embryonic spinal cord regulates AMPAergic and GABAergic synaptic strength. Spontaneous network activity (SNA) has been described in most developing circuits, including the spinal cord, retina, and hippocampus. Despite the widespread nature of this developmental phenomenon, its role in network maturation is poorly understood. We reduced SNA in the intact embryo and found compensatory increases in synaptic strength of spinal motoneuron inputs. AMPAergic miniature postsynaptic current (mPSC) amplitude and frequency increased following the reduction of activity. Interestingly, excitatory GABAergic mPSCs also increase in amplitude through a process of synaptic scaling. Finally, the normal modulation of GABAergic mPSC amplitude was accelerated. Together, these compensatory responses appear to increase the excitability of the cord and could act to maintain appropriate SNA levels, thus demonstrating a distinct functional role for synaptic homeostasis. Because spontaneous network activity can regulate AMPAergic and GABAergic synaptic strength during development, SNA is likely to play an important role in a coordinated maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength.",Excluded
1256,"Controlled damage in thick specimens by multiphoton excitation. Controlled damage by light energy has been a valuable tool in studies of cell function. Here, we show that the Ti:Sapphire laser in a multiphoton microscope can be used to cause localized damage within unlabeled cells or tissues at greater depths than previously possible. We show that the damage is due to a multiphoton process and made wounds as small as 1 microm in diameter 20 microm from the surface. A characteristic fluorescent scar allows monitoring of the damage and identifies the wound site in later observations. We were able to lesion a single axon within a bundle of nerves, locally interrupt organelle transport within one axon, cut dendrites in a zebrafish embryo, ablate a mitotic pole in a sea urchin egg, and wound the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope in starfish oocytes. The starfish nucleus collapsed approximately 1 h after wounding, indicating that loss of compartmentation barrier makes the structure unstable; surprisingly, the oocyte still completed meiotic divisions when exposed to maturation hormone, indicating that the compartmentalization and translocation of cdk1 and its regulators is not required for this process. Multiphoton excitation provides a new means for producing controlled damage deep within tissues or living organisms.",Excluded
2155,"Does prophylactic cranial irradiation improve overall survival of elderly patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer?. Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has led to improved overall survival (OS) for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has responded completely to chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy. However, whether PCI is indicated for elderly patients remains unclear. Method(s): We reviewed 658 patients with limited-stage SCLC treated in 1986-2009 at a single institution with definitive concurrent chemoradiation to a total radiation dose of 45-70 Gy. Variables investigated for possible association with OS included patient sex, age, ethnicity, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, year of diagnosis and treatment period (1986-1999 vs. 2000-2009), tumor size, radiation dose, cycles of induction chemotherapy, use of intensity-modulated-radiation-therapy (IMRT), and fractionation. Groups were compared with chi-square tests for categorical variables or medians tests for continuous variables. Kaplan-Meier estimates were constructed for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local-recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Result(s): Among 658 patients, 507 patients were <70 years old (Group A) and 151 patients were >=70 years old (Group B). Median survival time was significantly longer in the younger group (25.6 months vs. 20.3 months, P=0.007), but no differences were found in DFS, LRFS, or DMFS time by age. Of the 151 patients aged >=70 years (54 of whom received PCI and 89 did not), those treated in 2000-2009 (vs. 1986-1999) had better brain MFS than those treated in 1986-1999 (P=0.048); those who received PCI had better brain MFS than those who did not (P=0.033). Multivariate analysis showed that among patients aged >=70, receiving PCI, not receiving induction chemotherapy, and local-regional control were associated with fewer brain metastases (for PCI, subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]=0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.95, P=0.037; for induction chemotherapy, SHR=0.43, 95% CI=0.19-0.96, P=0.039; and for local-regional failure, SHR=0.996, 95% CI=0.993- 0.998, P=0.001). Among patients >=70, receipt of PCI seemed to have been associated with better OS for those with small-volume disease (primary+nodal disease <5 cm, P=0.0545) but not for those with larger-volume disease (P=0.7387). Conclusion(s): Patients aged >=70 years with small-volume limited-stage SCLC seemed to show a benefit in OS from the use of PCI, but those with larger-volume disease did not. Improved brain MFS was associated with use of PCI, no induction chemotherapy, and locoregional control.",Excluded
1691,"Biophysical Modeling of In Vivo Glioma Response After Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy in a Murine Model of Brain Cancer. PURPOSE: To develop and investigate a set of biophysical models based on a mechanically coupled reaction-diffusion model of the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor growth after radiation therapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Post-radiation therapy response is modeled using a cell death model (M<sub>d</sub>), a reduced proliferation rate model (M<sub>p</sub>), and cell death and reduced proliferation model (M<sub>dp</sub>). To evaluate each model, rats (n = 12) with C6 gliomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced MRI at 7 time points over 2 weeks. Rats received either 20 or 40 Gy between the third and fourth imaging time point. Diffusion-weighted MRI was used to estimate tumor cell number within enhancing regions in contrast-enhanced MRI data. Each model was fit to the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor cell number from time point 1 to time point 5 to estimate model parameters. The estimated model parameters were then used to predict tumor growth at the final 2 imaging time points. The model prediction was evaluated by calculating the error in tumor volume estimates, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number.RESULTS: For both the rats treated with either 20 or 40 Gy, significantly lower error in tumor volume, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number was observed for the M<sub>dp</sub> and M<sub>p</sub> models compared with the M<sub>d</sub> model. The M<sub>dp</sub> model fit, however, had significantly lower sum squared error compared with the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>d</sub> models.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that for both doses, the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>dp</sub> models result in accurate predictions of tumor growth, whereas the M<sub>d</sub> model poorly describes response to radiation therapy.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The present study was performed to investigate the effect of crocin on blue light- and white light-induced rod and cone death in primary retinal cell cultures.METHODS: Primary retinal cell cultures were prepared from primate and bovine retinas. Fifteen-day-old cultures were exposed to blue actinic light or to white fluorescent light for 24 hours. Cultures were treated by the addition of different concentrations of crocin for 24 hours before light exposure or for 8 hours after light exposure. Cultures kept in the dark were used as controls. Green nucleic acid stain assay was used to evaluate cell death. Rods and cones were immunolabeled with specific antibodies and counted. TUNEL labeling was used to detect fragmented DNA in fixed cells after light exposure.RESULTS: Primary retinal cell cultures contained a mixture of retinal cells enriched in photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and Muller cells. Twenty-four-hour exposure to blue and white light induced death in 70% to 80% of the photoreceptors in bovine and primate retinal cell cultures. Crocin protected the photoreceptors against blue light- or white light-mediated damage in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of approximately 30 microM. TUNEL assays confirmed that crocin protected photoreceptors from light damage.CONCLUSIONS: These results show that blue and white light selectively induce rod and cone cell death in an in vitro model.

2454,"Acute brain radiation injury of rabbits: A control study on proton MRS findings and histopathological changes. [Chinese]. Objective: To establish radiation induced brain injury rabbit models for observing <sup>1</sup>H-MRS changes and probing on the correlation between MRS findings and histopathological changes. Method(s): Twenty-seven adult New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 9 groups (each n=3). The rabbit brains were irradiated with a single dose of 25 Gy. The observation posts included pre-radiation and 1 to 8 weeks after radiation. Each group underwent single-voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS, after the completion of image acquisition, the animals were sacrificed, and histological specimens were obtained. Pathological changes were analyzed combined with MRS changes. Result(s): The metabolic ratios of choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) increased first and then decreased obviously. Cho/Cr was 1.52 +/- 0.28 pre-radiation, 3.20 +/- 0.72 at 4 weeks, and 2.04 +/- 0.05 at 8 weeks after radiation. The metabolic ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/Cr showed significant decrease tendency, which decreased to 1.28 +/- 0.05 8 weeks after radiation from pre-radiation value of 1.97 +/- 0.25. The metabolic ratios of Cho/NAA showed significant increase after irradiation, which increased to 2.04 +/- 0.78 at 8 weeks after radiation, while the value was 1.19 +/- 0.15 pre-irradiation. After irradiation, vascular changes included telangiectasias and thrombosis, which appeared 2 weeks after irradiation in the histology samples. From 4 weeks after irradiation, ueuron swelling, cytoplasm edema, astrocytosis and microglia hyperplasia could be observed, and demyelination were observed in the white matter and corpus callosum. Conclusion(s): The changes of MRS index are closely related with histopathological findings of acute brain radiation injury of rabbits.

2055,"Successful endoscopic hemostasis with cryotherapy for a case of refractory esophageal cancer bleeding. Gastrointestinal malignancy bleeding (GIMB) can be a clinical challenge. Options for treatment include surgical resection, radiation, angiography with embolization and endoscopic treatment (ET). Currently there is no standard of care for ET of GIMB. Modalities tried in the past include epinephrine injection, contact thermal devices, argon plasma coagulation (APC) and hemoclip (HC) placement. Cryotherapy (cryo) is a modality used for tumor ablation. It has also been successfully used in treatment of benign bleeding such as radiation proctitis and gastric antral vascular ectasia. There is one case report of cryo use in refractory GIMB leading to short term hemostasis (HS). We present a case of long term HS achieved by cryo in a patient with refractory GIMB. A 51 year old male with a history of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presented with melena. He was successfully treated with APC and was then referred for external beam radiation to prevent further bleeding. This combination achieved HS for around 8 months after which he presented with recurrent melena. A second attempt at treatment with APC achieved initial hemostasis but bleeding recurred 2 days later. Cryo was offered to him to aid with his dysphagia and possibly hemostasis. On EGD a fungating tumor oozing blood was seen in the distal third of the esophagus. Cryo was performed with 15 second freeze cycles. The patient experienced significant improvement in his dysphagia and resolution of his melena. The patient expired 2 months later due to newly diagnosed brain metastasis without recurrence of his melena. ET of GIMB continues to be a challenge. Multiple modalities can be tried including standard hemostatic maneuvers. Bleeding often recurs and can become refractory. Hemospray has been reported to be effective in these situations but is not available in the United States. Cryo, proven effective in refractory benign bleeding and approved for tumor ablation was used successfully in this patient. Cryo effect at standard application duration is limited to the superficial 5 mm of tissue. In addition to tumor necrosis has the theoretical advantage of forming crystal in the microvasculature leading to thrombosis and possibly hemostasis. This is a case of long term hemostasis achieved by cryotherapy in a patient with refractory tumor bleeding. A prospective study is needed to determine whether these effects can be reproduced in other patients. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
1590,"Microglial cytokine gene induction after irradiation is affected by morphologic differentiation. Microglia are known to play an important role in the CNS cytokine network, and their response after irradiation may be associated with the development of radiation-induced tissue damage. Radiation effects on this cytokine network have not yet been elucidated. We investigated the effect of gamma-irradiation on microglia stimulated with Zymosan A and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which alone induce the expression of some cytokines and neurotoxic products by microglial cells. In the resting condition (ramified microglia), radiation had no effect on the mRNA level corresponding to cytokines such as IL1beta or IL-6, although TGF-beta1 mRNA was minimally enhanced by irradiation. However, in the activated microglia (amoeboid microglia) stimulated with Zymosan A, radiation-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was increased about two-fold in comparison with non-irradiation. IL-1beta was slightly induced by 2 Gy irradiation, but was not induced by higher doses. TGF-beta1 mRNA was not enhanced by radiation following Zymosan stimulation. In the LPS-stimulated condition, IL-6 mRNA was induced only by 2 Gy of irradiation, but no change in the expression of other genes was detected. These results suggested that radiation exerted different effects on cytokine gene transcription in microglia depending on their morphological state.",Included

Objective This study aimed to examine the association between normal-but-low folate levels and cognitive function in the elderly population using a prospective cohort study. Methods We analyzed 3,910 participants whose serum folate levels were within the normal reference range (1.5-16.9 ng/mL) at baseline evaluation in the population-based prospective cohort study named the ""Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and De-mentia."" The association between baseline folate quartile categories and baseline cognitive disorders [mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia] was examined using binary logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounding variables. The risks of incident MCI and dementia associated with the decline of serum folate level during a 4-year follow-up period were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results The lowest quartile group of serum folate (>=1.5, <=5.9 ng/mL) showed a higher risk of cognitive disorders than did the highest quartile group at baseline evaluation (odds ratio 1.314, p=0.012). Over the 4 years of follow-up, the risk of incident dementia was 2.364 times higher among subjects whose serum folate levels declined from the 2nd-4th quartile group to the 1st quartile than among those for whom it did not (p=0.031). Conclusion Normal-but-low serum folate levels were associated with the risk of cognitive disorders in the elderly population, and a decline to normal-but-low serum folate levels was associated with incident dementia.

2251,"To examine the gene expression alterations in a rat's brain by GSM900 MHz. Objective: To examine the gene expression alterations in a rat's brain, treated by non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation from 900MHz-GSM mobile phone is main aim of this study. Background(s): As studies supported electromagnetic radiation may cause membrane leakage due to loss of calcium. Membrane leakage of lysosomes release DNAase which explains the fragmentation of DNA seen in cells exposed to mobile phone signals. Damage to DNA is a fundamental mechanism for developing tumors and cancer. The possibility of retaining mutations and cancer starting depends on when DNA damage exceeds the rate of DNA repair. DNA damage in brain cells can affect neurological functions and also possibly lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Method(s): In this study, we investigated whether an exposure of GSM-900 MHz irradiation from the Mobile Phone (3hours/day up to 28 days) could lead to the modulation of gene expression pattern in the rat brain. All rats were habitualised for one week prior to start the experiment in well designed circular mobile phone exposure (CCPE) cage. CCPE cage was specially designed for EMR exposure by mobile phone on the rats in the natural environment and it placed inside the exposure room where other electric appliances were not installed. In the cage, a mobile phone was placed in the center and rats were allowed to move around the device within 10 cm. radius. After 28 days, mRNA from the brain of control, sham and GSM-900 MHz exposed rats were isolated and subjected to Quantitative Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) array analysis. Gene expression was measured and expressed in fold change as described by Bandhyopadhay et.al. (2006). The qRT-PCR was performed by using Sybr green chemistry on ABI 7900HT platform. The real time quantification of amplification was done by measuring change in fluorescence by SDS2.3 software and further analyze by RQ manager. Result(s): Thus the results obtained from this study have shown that there is no significant change in expressions of genes involved in DNA damage and repair pathways such as chromatin assembly (CHAF1A), DNA damage checkpoints (Chk1), DNA synthesis (POLD1), post-transcriptional processes (RBM4), translation synthesis (POLI) and stress signaling (Hsp90) as compared with controls.

1693,"""Critical periods"" in vestibular development or adaptation of gravity sensory systems to altered gravitational conditions?. 1. A feature of sensory, neuronal and motor systems is the existence of a critical period during their development. Modification of environmental conditions during this specific period of life affects development in a long-term manner, or even irreversibly. Deprivation is the prefered approach to study the existence and duration of critical periods. For gravity sensory systems, space flights offer the only opportunity for deprivation conditions. 2. Studies in a fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) and an amphibian (Xenopus laevis) revealed a significant sensitivity of their roll-induced static vestibuloocular reflex (rVOR) to a 9- to 10-day gravity deprivation (microgravity) during a spaceflight. In some instances, the rVOR was augmented after the flight as demonstrated in young Oreochromis which were launched when their rVOR had not been developed, and in Xenopus tadpoles launched after their rVOR had developed. Fish which could perform the rVOR at launch were insensitive to microgravity exposure. A similar insensitivity to microgravity was observed in Xenopus tadpoles with normal body shape which had not yet developed their rVOR at launch. Some tadpoles, however, developed an upward bended tail during their space flight; their rVOR was significantly depressed after termination of microgravity independent of the age at onset of the flight. Hypergravity depressed the rVOR for all so far tested developmental stages in both Oreochromis and Xenopus. 3. Both adaptive processes during exposure to altered gravity as well as the existence of a critical period in vestibular development might be responsible for the modulation of the rVOR recorded after exposure to altered gravity. Deprivation studies have to be extended to older developmental stages to test the possibility of a critical period; however, this approach is limited due to the low number of space flights.

1364,"Effect of radiographic techniques (kVp and mAs) on image quality and patient doses in digital subtraction angiography. We investigated how varying the x-ray tube voltage and image receptor input exposure affected image quality and patient radiation doses in interventional neuroradiologic imaging. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images were obtained of a phantom with 1 mm diameter vessels containing iodine at concentrations between 4.5 and 50 mg/cc. The detection threshold concentration of iodine was determined by inspecting DSA images obtained at a range of x-ray tube voltages and input exposure levels. Surface doses were obtained from measured x-ray tube output data, and corresponding values of energy imparted were determined using the exposure-area product incident on the phantom. In one series of experiments, the air kerma at the image intensifier (X) was varied between 0.44 muGy per frame and 8.8 muGy per frame at a constant x-ray tube voltage of 70 kVp. In a second series of experiments, the tube voltage was varied between 50 and 100 kVp, and the mAs adjusted to maintain a constant exposure level at the input of the image intensifier. At a constant x-ray tube voltage, the surface dose and energy imparted were directly proportional to the input exposure per frame used to acquire the DSA images. On our DSA system operated below 2.2 muGy per frame, the threshold iodine concentration was found to be proportional to X<sup>-0.57</sup>, which is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction for a quantum noise limited imaging system. Above 2.2 muGy per frame, however, the threshold iodine concentration was proportional to X<sup>-0.26</sup>, indicating that increasing the input exposure above this value will only achieve modest improvements in image quality. At a constant image intensifier input exposure level, increasing the x-ray tube voltage from 50 kVp to 100 kVp reduced the surface dose by a factor of 6.1, and the energy imparted by a factor of 3.5. The detection threshold iodine concentration was found to be proportional to kVp<sup>n</sup>, where n was 2.1 at 1.1 muGy per frame, and 1.6 at 3.9 muGy per frame. For clinical situations that can be modeled by a uniform phantom, reducing the x-ray tube voltage rather than increasing the exposure level would best achieve improvements on our DSA imaging system performance. © 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded

SCLC is a highly aggressive tumor with a propensity for early metastases and a high case-fatality rate. Systemic treatment with etoposide plus a platinum agent is recommended for all stages of this disease and has been a standard first-line therapy for SCLC since the 1980s. Three recently presented randomized clinical trials failed to show superiority of newer regimens over etoposide and cisplatin. Patients with limited-stage (LS) disease benefit from the addition of radiotherapy to systemic chemotherapy, a combination that affords high complete response rates and potential cures. Incremental improvements in radiotherapy delivery over the past decade include the use of accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radlotherapy for LS disease. Prophylactic cranial irradiation, previously recommended for patients with LS disease, has recently been shown to benefit those with extensive-stage (ES) disease as well.

Eleven patients (79%) had tumor regression (n = 11) shown on MRI after SRS. The median overall survival after SRS was 9.5 months. No patient had a major radiation-related complication. Conclusion Stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with recurrent CNSL is well tolerated and has a high rate of radiographic response. A marginal dose of 15.5 Gy or greater, a Karnofsky score of 80 or greater, and the absence of pre-SRS WBRT were associated with significantly longer overall survival. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be beneficial as an initial salvage therapy in the treatment of recurrent CNSL for properly selected patients. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

1629,"Requirement for Atm in ionizing radiation-induced cell death in the developing central nervous system. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration that results from mutation of the ATM gene. However, neither the normal function of ATM in the nervous system nor the biological basis of the degeneration in AT is known. Resistance to apoptosis in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Atm-/- mice was observed after ionizing radiation. This lack of death occurred in diverse regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, which is markedly affected in AT. In wild-type, but not Atm-/- mice, up-regulation of p53 coincided with cell death, suggesting that Atm-dependent apoptosis in the CNS is mediated by p53. Further, p53 null mice showed a similar lack of radiation-induced cell death in the developing nervous system. Atm may function at a developmental survival checkpoint that serves to eliminate neurons with excessive DNA damage.",Included

1377,"Predicting Risk in Space: Genetic Markers for Differential Vulnerability to Sleep Restriction. Several laboratories have found large, highly reliable individual differences in the magnitude of cognitive performance, fatigue and sleepiness, and sleep homeostatic vulnerability to acute total sleep deprivation and to chronic sleep restriction in healthy adults. Such individual differences in neurobehavioral performance are also observed in space flight as a result of sleep loss. The reasons for these stable phenotypic differential vulnerabilities are unknown: such differences are not yet accounted for by demographic factors, IQ or sleep need, and moreover, psychometric scales do not predict those individuals cognitively vulnerable to sleep loss. The stable, trait-like (phenotypic) inter-individual differences observed in response to sleep loss-with intraclass correlation coefficients accounting for 58%-92% of the variance in neurobehavioral measures- point to an underlying genetic component. To this end, we utilized multi-day highly controlled laboratory studies to investigate the role of various common candidate gene variants-each independently-in relation to cumulative neurobehavioral and sleep homeostatic responses to sleep restriction. These data suggest that common genetic variations (polymorphisms) involved in sleep-wake, circadian, and cognitive regulation may serve as markers for prediction of inter-individual differences in sleep homeostatic and neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep restriction in healthy adults. Identification of genetic predictors of differential vulnerability to sleep restriction-as determined from candidate gene studies-will help identify astronauts most in need of fatigue countermeasures in space flight and inform medical standards for obtaining adequate sleep in space. This review summarizes individual differences in neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep deprivation and ongoing genetic efforts to identify markers of such differences.",Excluded
2146,"Localization of glutathione and induction of glutathione synthesis-related proteins in mouse brain by low doses of gamma-rays. First, we determined the cerebral localization of reduced glutathione (GSH) in normal mice by means of autoradiography using 99mTc-meso-hexamethyl propylene oxime. A highly specific localization of GSH in the cerebellum and hippocampus was observed. Secondly, we measured the elevation of GSH level in the brain after low-dose gamma-irradiation. The cerebral GSH levels increased soon after irradiation with 50 cGy of gamma-rays, reaching a maximum at 3 h post-treatment, then remaining significantly higher than that of the non-irradiated control until 12 h and returning to the control level by 24 h. Thirdly, we examined the induction of the activities and the mRNAs of proteins involved in the synthesis and regeneration of GSH in the brain of mice subjected to low-dose gamma-ray irradiation. The level of mRNA for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase was significantly increased at 0.5 h, and remained high until 2 h post-irradiation (50 cGy). The level was transiently lowered to the non-irradiated control level at 3 h and slightly increased again after 6 h post-irradiation. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was significantly increased 3 h after irradiation, and remained high up to 24 h post-irradiation. As for glutathione reductase, the mRNA level was increased at 0.5 h, and peaked strongly at 2 h, while the enzyme activity was significantly increased at 6 h after irradiation, and continued to increase up to 24 h. The level of mRNA for thioredoxin, which contributes to GSH biosynthesis by supplying cysteine to the de novo pathway, peaked between 0.5 h and 2 h post-irradiation, and rapidly declined thereafter. The content of thioredoxin showed a transient decrease immediately after irradiation, but was then remarkably elevated, reaching a maximum at 3 h, and thereafter declining sharply. These results indicate that the increase in endogenous GSH in mouse brain soon after low-dose gamma-ray irradiation is a consequence of the induction of GSH synthesis-related proteins and occurs via both the de novo synthesis and the regeneration pathways.",Included
1603,"Thermoregulation in pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana, Ord) in winter. Conservation of energy is a prerequisite thermoregulatory strategy for survival in northern hemisphere winters. We have used thermistor/data logger assemblies to measure temperatures in the brain, carotid artery, jugular vein and abdominal cavity, in pronghorn antelope to determine their winter body temperature and to investigate whether the carotid rete has a survival role. Over the study period mean black globe and air temperature were -0.5+/-3.2 degrees C and -2.0+/-3.4 degrees C, respectively, and mean daytime solar radiation was approximately 186 W m(-2). Brain temperature (T(brain), 39.3+/-0.3 degrees C) was higher than carotid blood temperature (T(carotid), 38.5+/-0.4 degrees C), and higher than jugular temperature (T(jugular), 37.9+/-0.7 degrees C). Minimum T(brain) (38.5+/-0.4 degrees C) and T(carotid) (37.8+/-0.2 degrees C) in winter were higher than the minimum T(brain) (37.7+/-0.5 degrees C) and T(carotid) (36.4+/-0.8 degrees C) in summer that we have reported previously. Compared with summer, winter body temperature patterns were characterized by an absence of selective brain cooling (SBC), a higher range of T(brain), a range of T(carotid) that was significantly narrower (1.8 degrees C) than in summer (3.1 degrees C), and changes in T(carotid) and T(brain) that were more highly correlated (r=0.99 in winter vs r=0.83 in summer). These findings suggest that in winter the effects of the carotid rete are reduced, which eliminates SBC and prevents independent regulation of T(brain), thus coupling T(brain) to T(carotid). The net effect is that T(carotid) varies little. A possible consequence is depression of metabolism, with the survival advantage of conservation of energy. These findings also suggest that the carotid rete has wider thermoregulatory effects than its traditional SBC function.",Excluded
1198,"Radiation necrosis or glioma recurrence: is computer-assisted stereotactic biopsy useful?. Fifty-one patients with supratentorial glioma treated with external beam radiotherapy (median dose 59.5 Gy) who then demonstrated clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression underwent stereotactic biopsy to differentiate tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis. The original tumor histological type was diffuse or fibrillary astrocytoma in 21 patients (41%), oligodendroglioma in 13 (26%), and oligoastrocytoma in 17 (33%); 40 tumors (78%) were low-grade (Kernohan Grade 1 or 2). The median time to suspected disease progression was 28 months. Stereotactic biopsy showed tumor recurrence in 30 patients (59%), radiation necrosis in three (6%), and a mixture of both in 17 (33%); one patient (2%) had a parenchymal radiation-induced chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The tumor type at stereotactic biopsy was similar to the original tumor type and was astrocytoma in 24 patients (47%), oligodendroglioma in eight (16%), oligoastrocytoma in 16 (31%), unclassifiable in two (4%), and chondroblastic osteosarcoma in one patient (2%). At biopsy, however, only 19 tumors (37%) were low grade (Kernohan Grade 1 or 2). Subsequent surgery confirmed the stereotactic biopsy histological findings in eight patients. Follow-up examination showed 14 patients alive with a median survival of 1 year for the entire group. Median survival times after biopsy were 0.83 year for patients with tumor recurrence and 1.86 years for patients with both tumor recurrence and radionecrosis; these findings were significantly different (p = 0.008, log-rank test). No patient with radiation necrosis alone died. Other factors associated with reduced survival were a high proportion of residual tumor (p = 0.024), a low proportion of radionecrosis (p < 0.001), and a Kernohan Grade of 3 or 4 (p = 0.005). In conclusion, in patients with previously irradiated supratentorial gliomas in whom radionecrosis or tumor recurrence was clinically or radiographically suspected, results of stereotactic biopsy could be used to differentiate tumor recurrence, radiation necrosis, a mixture of both lesions, or radiation-induced neoplasm. In addition, biopsy results could predict survival rates.",Excluded
1497,"Use of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay to measure radiation-induced chromosome damage in lymphoblastoid cell lines. To establish the optimal experimental conditions for the use of the micronuclei (MN) test to determine the level of chromosomal damage induced by ionising radiation (IR) exposure in lymphoblastoid cell lines, a time-course study was performed comparing a normal and an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cell line, the latter being characterised by an extreme radiation sensitivity. Several parameters were analysed: the use of cytochalasin-B (Cyt-B) to quantify MN, the optimum fixation time to measure radiation-induced MN, the most appropriate treatment dose of IR to distinguish between the normal and the radiosensitive cells and the cell-cycle distribution after irradiation. The results obtained showed that the spontaneous as well as the radiation-induced levels of MN were significantly higher in the AT cell compared to the normal cells (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). In both cell types the number of radiation-induced MN were lower in the cultures without Cyt-B than those with Cyt-B (P < 0.001), with the AT cells being distinguished in terms of IR-induced MN from the normal cells only with the addition of Cyt-B. The level of MN formation was independent of the dose of Cyt-B used (3 or 6 microg/ml). The optimum time for radiation-induced MN measured was found to be between 48 and 72 h post-irradiation, with 2 and 4 Gy exposures inducing similar levels of MN. However, as the higher dose caused a greater delay in the cell-cycle, treatment with 2 Gy with MN measurement at 48 h in the presence of 3 microg/ml Cyt-B were chosen as the optimum experimental conditions. This choice was validated using two additional normal and AT cell lines. In conclusion, our results show that the use of Cyt-B increases the sensitivity of the MN test for comparing differences in radiosensitivity between lymphoblastoid cell lines.",Excluded

1213,"Data collection procedures for bone marrow dosimetry in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 177Lu-DOTATATE on neuroendocrine tumors. Introduction: By medio 2012 Rigshospitalet has treated more than 60 patients with neuroendocrine tumors with 177Lu-Dotatate. Patients are scheduled for 4 treatments with 8-10 weeks in between. Cells in the red bone marrow are vulnerable to radiation and are together with the kidneys the organs at risk in patients undergoing 177Lu-Dotatate therapy. The effective dose given to the red bone marrow can be estimated from the calculated accumulated radioactivity in the blood. Aim(s): To described the procedure for collection of blood samples, measurement of radioactivity in the blood and for estimating the effective dose to bone marrow following 177Lu-Dotatate therapy. Method(s): At the first treatment a total of eight blood samples is collected at the following time points: 45, 90, 150 and 210 minutes, 8 and 24 hours, and 4 and 7 days after the administration of 177Lu-Dotatate. For the following three treatments no blood samples are collected at day 4 and 7, resulting in a total of six samples. The first four blood samples are drawn from a venflon or venipuncture in the opposite arm of the infusion of the radionuclide in order to avoid contamination of the samples. The exact time of sampling is recorded for all blood samples. The activity of Lu-177 in the blood is so high shortly after administration that even small sample volumes causes lack of accuracy due to the dead time of the counting apparatus. Therefore samples are stored for seven days before they are prepared for counting. Measurements during the development of the data collection procedure showed that the radioactivity was at least 1.5 greater in whole blood than in plasma. Measurement of radioactivity is therefore done on whole blood from which samples of 500 muL blood is taken. The amount of Lu-177 in the 500 muL blood samples (duplicate samples for every time point) is measured in a well counter (Canberra Cobra-II auto-gamma) using a 15-400 keV window and a counting time of 10 min which is sufficient for good count statistics. Based on the measured cpm/sample the Lu-177 concentration in the blood (Bq/ml) is calculated for every time point and the result are plotted in a time-activity graph. Conclusion(s): It is possible to measure accumulated radioactivity in the blood over time and thereby estimate the effective dose to the red bone marrow using a time-activity graph obtained from the described procedure.",Excluded
2190,"Calvarial and skull base metastases: expanding the clinical utility of Gamma Knife surgery. OBJECT: Traditionally, the treatment of choice for patients with metastases to the calvaria or skull base has been conventional radiation therapy. Because patients with systemic malignancies are also at risk for intracranial metastases, the utility of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for these patients has been explored to reduce excess radiation exposure to the perilesional brain parenchyma. The purpose of this study was to report the efficacy of GKS for the treatment of calvarial metastases and skull base lesions.METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of 21 patients with at least 1 calvarial or skull base metastatic lesion treated with GKS during 2001-2013. For 7 calvarial lesions, a novel technique, in which a bolus was placed over the treatment site, was used. For determination of local control or disease progression, radiation therapy data were examined and posttreatment MR images and oncology records were reviewed. Survival times from the date of procedure were estimated by using Kaplan-Meier analyses.RESULTS: The median patient age at treatment was 57 years (range 29-84 years). A total of 19 (90%) patients received treatment for single lesions, 1 patient received treatment for 3 lesions, and 1 patient received treatment for 4 lesions. The most common primary tumor was breast cancer (24% of patients). Per lesion, the median clinical and radiographic follow-up times were 10.3 months (range 0-71.9 months) and 7.1 months (range 0-61.3 months), respectively. Of the 26 lesions analyzed, 14 (54%) were located in calvarial bones and 12 (46%) were located in the skull base. The median lesion volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 0.3-55.6 cm(3)), and the median prescription margin dose was 15 Gy (range 13-24 Gy). The median overall survival time for all patients was 35.9 months, and the 1-year local control rate was 88.9% (95% CI 74.4%-100%). Local control rates did not differ between lesions treated with the bolus technique and those treated with traditional methods or between calvarial lesions and skull base lesions (p > 0.05). Of the 3 patients for whom local treatment failed, 1 patient received no further treatment and 2 patients responded to salvage chemotherapy. Subsequent brain parenchymal metastases developed in 2 patients, who then underwent GKS.CONCLUSIONS: GKS is an effective treatment modality for patients with metastases to the calvarial bones or skull base. For patients with superficial calvarial lesions, a novel approach with bolus application resulted in excellent rates of local control. GKS provides an effective therapeutic alternative to conventional radiation therapy and should be considered for patients at risk for calvarial metastases and brain parenchymal metastases.",Excluded

Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been proposed as an alternative to surgical resection. We report serious adverse effects of the treatment after follow-up periods over 9 years in 11 patients treated with GKRS between 1997 and 2000. The target volume of the entorhinoamygdalohippocampectomy area was 4.8-17.1 ml. Marginal dose of 20-25 Gy to the 50% isodose was delivered. One patient was drowned after suffering seizure 7 months after GKRS. Two patients did not show any reduction in seizure frequency over 9 and 18 months. Both patients requested open surgery and became seizure-free postoperatively. Four of the other eight patients were classified as Engel's class I within 4 years after GKRS. One of the four patients experienced symptomatic radiation-induced cerebral edema transiently, one developed radiation necrosis and required surgery 5 years after GKRS, and one developed cognitive impairment with hemiparesis 10 years after GKRS. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed a large cyst in the irradiated temporal lobe. This patient recovered fully after the cyst excision. Only one patient became seizure-free and antiepileptic drug-free without symptomatic radiation-induced complications. However, MR imaging revealed abnormal enhancement, cyst formation, and diffuse white matter change in the irradiated temporal lobe 9 years after GKRS. GKRS for MTLE causes adverse effects of delayed seizure remission and symptomatic radiation-induced complications. Therefore, GKRS cannot be considered as an ideal alternative to surgery for MTLE. Long-term follow-up studies including MR imaging with contrast medium are required for the patients even after successful control of seizures.",Excluded
2240,"Comparison between dose values specified at the ICRU reference point and the mean dose to the planning target volume. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare dose values specified at the reference point, as recommended by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, ICRU, and the mean dose to the planning target volume, PTV.MATERIAL AND METHODS: CT-based dose calculations were performed with a 3-D treatment planning system for 6 series of patients treated for bladder, brain, breast, lung, oropharynx and parotid gland tumour. All patients were arbitrarily chosen from a set of previously treated patients irradiated with a two- or three-field technique using customised blocks. Appropriate wedge angles and beam weights were chosen to make the dose distribution as homogeneous as possible.RESULTS: The dose at the ICRU reference point was generally higher than the mean dose to the PTV. The difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV for an individual patient was less than 3% in 88% of cases and less than 2% in 72% of the cases. The differences were larger in those patients where the dose distribution is significantly influenced by the presence of lungs or air gaps. For each series of patients the mean difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV was calculated. The difference between these two values never exceeded 2%. Because not all planning systems are able to calculate the mean dose to the PTV, the concept of the mean central dose, the mean of the dose values at the centre of the PTV in each CT slice, has been introduced. The mean central dose was also calculated for the same patients and was closer to the mean dose to the PTV than the ICRU reference dose.CONCLUSION: The mean dose to the PTV is well estimated by either the ICRU reference dose or the mean central dose for a variety of treatment techniques for common types of cancer.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that ionizing radiation may be associated with unexpected side-effects in melanoma patients treated with concomitant BRAF inhibitors. A large multicenter analysis was carried out to generate reliable safety data and elucidate the mechanism.METHODS: A total of 161 melanoma patients from 11 European skin cancer centers were evaluated for acute and late toxicity, of whom 70 consecutive patients received 86 series of radiotherapy with concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy. To further characterize and quantify a possible radiosensitization by BRAF inhibitors, blood samples of 35 melanoma patients were used for individual radiosensitivity testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization of chromosomal breaks after ex vivo irradiation.RESULTS: With radiotherapy and concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy the rate of acute radiodermatitis >=2degree was 36% and follicular cystic proliferation was seen in 13% of all radiotherapies. Non-skin toxicities included hearing disorders (4%) and dysphagia (2%). Following whole-brain radiotherapy, rates of radiodermatitis >=2degree were 44% and 8% (P < 0.001) for patients with and without BRAF inhibitor therapy, respectively. Concomitant treatment with vemurafenib induced acute radiodermatitis >=2degree more frequently than treatment with dabrafenib (40% versus 26%, P = 0.07). In line with these findings, analysis of chromosomal breaks ex vivo indicated significantly increased radiosensitivity for patients under vemurafenib (P = 0.004) and for patients switched from vemurafenib to dabrafenib (P = 0.002), but not for patients on dabrafenib only. No toxicities were reported after stereotactic treatment.CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy with concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy is feasible with an acceptable increase in toxicity.

In a previous study using Oregon Green BAPTA-1 fluorescence we found that intracellular calcium concentration in spider mechanoreceptor neurons rose during mechanical stimulation. We also showed that calcium elevation required the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels by action potentials, and could not be produced by the receptor potential alone. While evidence for mechanisms of calcium elevation in these neurons was clear, our estimates of actual calcium concentration depended on properties of the fluorescent dye in the neuron cytoplasm that could not be verified. We have now developed a method for ratiometric estimation of calcium concentration in these neurons using Fura Red dye, excitation by two light emitting diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths, and an avalanche photodiode fluorescence detector. The method is simple and economical to implement, allows concentration changes to be measured in the millisecond time range, and could easily be applied to a wide range of preparations.

Of the 21 men and 8 women who were treated, 1 had stage IIB (T3N0M0) and the remainder had stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Mean patient age at surgery was 53.4 years. There were 15 right pneumonectomies, of which 2 were for pancoast tumors. All patients received concurrent preoperative chemoradiation. Mean total radiation dose was 61.1 Gy. All patients went on to have complete (R0) resection by pneumonectomy. Pathologic complete response was found in 16 patients (55.2%). All patients were discharged alive from the hospital after pneumonectomy. Median hospital length of stay was 5 days (mean 8.6). Ninety-day mortality after surgery was 3.4% (n = 1). Recurrences have been found in 11 patients (38%), including brain metastases (n = 6), bone metastases (n = 4), liver metastases (n = 2), and cervical lymph node metastases (n = 2). One patient had a contralateral new primary lung cancer develop 70 months after undergoing pneumonectomy. Estimated 5-year disease-free survival is 48%.

1634,"Genetic delivery of a miRNA cluster with polycistronic siRNAs reduces expression of epidermal growth receptor in human glioblastoma cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common malignancy of the brain, is a grade IV astrocytoma. It is one of the most rapidly growing and invasive types of glial tumors. The standard therapy includes surgical removal, radiation and chemotherapy with a median survival of about 14 months. In addition, systemic therapies are limited by the blood-brain barrier. To bypass the barrier, we are developing a gene delivery strategy to inhibit the expression of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR), which are commonly upregulated in GBM. One TKR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is overexpressed in GBM leading to uncontrolled growth and proliferation. Our approach is to recruit the RNA interference pathway. Although small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are often utilized to silence gene expression, exogenously expressed siRNAs are not an effective strategy to treat human disease due to both extracellular and intracellular nucleases as well as activation of cellular immunity against foreign nucleic acids. To bypass these degradatory mechanisms, we use a natural miRNA cluster genetic background to effectively deliver the DNA encoding multiple anti-EGFR siRNAs by inserting them into the tertiary structure of the miRNA cluster, miR-17-92. The anti-EGFR polycistronic miRNA cluster (pAAV-miR-IP1) expresses six siRNAs directed against EGFR, specifically targeting the extracellular ligand binding domain, transmembrane domain, intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and 3' untranslated region of the EGFR transcript. The vector, pAAV-miR-IP1, was transfected into the human GBM cell lines, A172 and U87MG. Results demonstrate that pAAV-miR-IP1 was expressed at high levels with a subsequent reduction in EGFR mRNA expression. Additional strategies include using the polycistronic delivery mechanism to target multiple TKRs in addition to EGFR.",Excluded

Alternating electric fields at an intermediate frequency (100~300 kHz), called tumor treating fields (TTFs), are reported to interrupt the process of mitosis via apoptosis and to act as an inhibitor of cell proliferation. Although the presence of an antimitotic effect of TTFs has been widely reported, the efficacy of TTFs is still controversial issue among medical experts. To resolve this controversial issue, the comparison study between the effects of TTFs and the effect of other conventional cancer treatment techniques need to be carried out. In this study, experimental evidence of the synergistic antimitotic effect of TTFs in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) is reported. For these experiments, aggressive brain cancer cells, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (U373 and U87), were treated either with TTFs alone, with IR alone or with TTFs followed by ionizing radiation (IR). The percentages of cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and mitotic abnormalities were increased by the application of TTFs alone and its quantity was markedly increased when TTFs were combined with IR. Our results also suggested that radiotherapy together with TTFs may be clinically beneficial since the combination treatment seemed to synergistically suppress both cell migration and invasion, based on the inhibition of MMP-9 and vimentin.",Excluded

She reported a similar episode 1 week prior after which her vision recovered, as well as a month-long history of left-sided temporal headaches associated with photosensitivity. Review of systems was positive for episodic paresthesias of bilateral forearms, hands, and feet. She denied constitutional symptoms, rash, joint pain, and drug use of any kind. Family history was remarkable for father with ocular migraine, and grandparents with rheumatoid arthritis and neurosarcoidosis. Exam revealed a left monocular lower quandrantanopsia, normal venous pulsations, no cherry red spot and a normal neurological exam. An extensive rheumatic and infectious workup was negative, including a hypercoaguability panel, antinuclear antibody, ESR, CRP, and hemoglobin evaluation. A brain MRI/MRA without contrast showed patent bilateral ophthalmic arteries. Face and neck MRI with contrast, transthoracic echocardiography with bubble study, electromyography, as well as nerve conduction studies were all unremarkable. Given the negative workup, the presumable etiology was thought to be vasospasm with migraine.

DISCUSSION: Overall, central and branch retinal artery occlusions (CRAO and BRAO) are rare with an incidence of approximately 1 to 10 in 100,000, with an affected mean age of 60-65 years. The etiology varies with age, with carotid artery atherosclerosis being most common overall, as high as 70%; however, for patients less than 40 years of age, cardiogenic embolism is much more likely. Therefore, workup for younger patients should be focused on evaluating for sources of cardiogenic embolism such as arrhythmias, murmurs, congenital heart disease, and substance abuse. For older patients, temporal arteritis should be ruled out. Vascular diseases such as fibromuscular dysplasia, radiation injury, or hematologic diseases including sickle cell anemia, hypercoagulable states, and hyperviscosity syndrome can affect all ages and should be investigated if other causes are excluded. Rare causes of CRAO/BRAO include infections due to Bartonella, toxoplasmosis, and varicella; ocular surgery; fat or amniotic fluid embolism; and vasospasm with or without migraine, which is a diagnosis of exclusion. There have only been case studies describing CRAO associated with vasculitis.",Excluded
1234,"[Carbon-11 labeled diacylglycerol for signal transduction imaging: effect of the solubilizer on the distribution and radiation dosimetry]. Carbon-11 labeled diacylglycerol (11C-DAG) has been developed as a signal transduction imaging agent for the CNS, and it can visualize the second messenger. For clinical application by positron CT (PET), the 11C-DAG solution must be prepared for intravenous injection. However, the 11C-DAG does not dissolve in water because of its lipophilicity and requires a solubilizer such as human serum albumin (HSA) and Tween 80 (TW-80). We examined the influence of these solubilizers on the tissue distribution of 11C-DAG, and estimated the radiation dosimetry. In the brain, uptake of 11C-DAG dissolved with HSA was 1.3-1.8 times higher than that of dissolved with TW-80. On the other hand, the lung and spleen showed a higher uptake of 11C-DAG using TW-80 than when using HSA. Especially, the lungs showed 20-40 times higher uptake than when using HSA. Also, the washout of radioactivity from tissue was slower, and the dose of radiation exposure was estimated to be higher, with TW-80 than with HSA. Therefore, between TW-80 and HSA with different solubilizing mechanisms, the later was suggested to be a better solubilizer of 11C-DAG.",Excluded

1630,"Characterization of Na+-activated K+ currents in larval lamprey spinal cord neurons. Potassium channels play an important role in controlling neuronal firing and synaptic interactions. Na(+)-activated K(+) (K(Na)) channels have been shown to exist in neurons in different regions of the CNS, but their physiological function has been difficult to assess. In this study, we have examined if neurons in the spinal cord possess K(Na) currents. We used whole cell recordings from isolated spinal cord neurons in lamprey. These neurons display two different K(Na) currents. The first was transient and activated by the Na(+) influx during the action potentials, and it was abolished when Na(+) channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin. The second K(Na) current was sustained and persisted in tetrodotoxin. Both K(Na) currents were abolished when Na(+) was substituted with choline or N-methyl-D-glucamine, indicating that they are indeed dependent on Na(+) influx into neurons. When Na(+) was substituted with Li(+), the amplitude of the inward current was unchanged, whereas the transient K(Na) current was reduced but not abolished. This suggests that the transient K(Na) current is partially activated by Li(+). These two K(Na) currents have different roles in controlling the action potential waveform. The transient K(Na) appears to act as a negative feedback mechanism sensing the Na(+) influx underlying the action potential and may thus be critical for setting the amplitude and duration of the action potential. The sustained K(Na) current has a slow kinetic of activation and may underlie the slow Ca(2+)-independent afterhyperpolarization mediated by repetitive firing in lamprey spinal cord neurons.",Excluded
1896,"Characterisation of GafchromicTM EBT3 dosimetric film for use at high dose levels in commissioning of radiosurgery. Aim: A robust tool is required for the dosimetric verification of high dose small fields associated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (SRT). The response characteristics of EBT3 have been determined for the high dose range. The application of the film in SRS/SRT quality assurance testing has been evaluated. Method(s): The response characteristics of EBT3 (Lot# 07221303) were examined using an Epson Expression 10000XL flatbed scanner in combination with ImageJ and RIT software. Red, green and blue channel responses were analysed for 0-40 Gy. Green channel inter and intra film uniformity, dose rate dependence and post exposure darkening were characterised at high doses. Film uniformity was compared using two films from the same batch, each divided into 16 equal pieces and irradiated with 15 Gy. The characterisation was complemented by verifying a cranial SRS treatment with the film positioned in a LucyTM phantom. Result(s): The dose response curves of the three colour channels were compared across a 0-40 Gy dose range. Green channel analysis was found to be optimal for doses above 10 Gy due to its wider dynamic range. The dose response curves of two 6 MV beams delivered at 1000 MU/min and 600 MU/min rep rate across a 0-40 Gy dose range were found to agree with a maximum variation of 1.3%. The postirradiation darkening of EBT3 for 10, 15 and 25 Gy was determined. The dose distribution of an iPlanTM SRS treatment was verified. Conclusion(s): The new generation EBT3 film is suitable for use with high doses up to the manufacturer's recommended limit of 40 Gy. Analysis with the green channel is recommended. Calibration at the dose rate used for delivery should be considered.",Excluded
1286,"Predictors of individual tumor local control after stereotactic radiosurgery for non-small cell lung cancer brain metastases. Purpose: To evaluate local control rates and predictors of individual tumor local control for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Methods and Materials: Between June 1998 and May 2011, 401 brain metastases in 228 patients were treated with Gamma Knife single-fraction SRS. Local failure was defined as an increase in lesion size after SRS. Local control was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to identify an optimal cutpoint for conformality index relative to local control. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Median age was 60 years (range, 27-84 years). There were 66 cerebellar metastases (16%) and 335 supratentorial metastases (84%). The median prescription dose was 20 Gy (range, 14-24 Gy). Median overall survival from time of SRS was 12.1 months. The estimated local control at 12 months was 74%. On multivariate analysis, cerebellar location (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94, P=.009), larger tumor volume (HR 1.09, P<.001), and lower conformality (HR 0.700, P=.044) were significant independent predictors of local failure. Conformality index cutpoints of 1.4-1.9 were predictive of local control, whereas a cutpoint of 1.75 was the most predictive (P=.001). The adjusted Kaplan-Meier 1-year local control for conformality index >=1.75 was 84% versus 69% for conformality index <1.75, controlling for tumor volume and location. The 1-year adjusted local control for cerebellar lesions was 60%, compared with 77% for supratentorial lesions, controlling for tumor volume and conformality index. Conclusions: Cerebellar tumor location, lower conformality index, and larger tumor volume were significant independent predictors of local failure after SRS for brain metastases from NSCLC. These results warrant further investigation in a prospective setting. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2354,"The distribution of thirteen GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain. III. Embryonic and postnatal development. The embryonic and postnatal expression of 13 GABAA receptor subunit genes in the rat CNS was studied by in situ hybridization. Each transcript exhibited a unique regional and temporal developmental expression profile. For example, in both embryonic and early postnatal cortex and thalamus, expression of the alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and beta 3 mRNAs was pronounced. In particular, the alpha 5 gene expression underwent a prominent peak in early brain. Subsequently, the thalamocortical expression of these four genes substantially diminished and was superseded in the adult by the alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, and delta subunit mRNAs. Similarly, gamma 1 and gamma 3 gene expression also dropped markedly during development, their initial stronger expression being restricted to relatively few structures. In contrast, gamma 2 gene expression was widespread and mostly remained constant with increasing age. The medial septum and globus pallidus were regions expressing few subunits in both early postnatal and adult stages, allowing clear developmental combinatorial changes to be inferred (alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 1 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 1/gamma 2, respectively). In contrast, cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibited no developmental switch, expressing only the alpha 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs from birth to adult. Certain GABAA transcripts were also detected in germinal zones (e.g., beta 1, beta 3, gamma 1) and in embryonic peripheral tissues such as dorsal root ganglia (e.g., alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 3, gamma 2) and intestine (gamma 3). Some parallels in regional and temporal CNS expression were noted (e.g., alpha 1 beta 2, alpha 2 beta 3, alpha 4/alpha 6 delta), whereas the alpha 5 and beta 1 regional mRNA expressions converted over time. The changes of GABAA receptor subunit gene expression suggest a molecular explanation for earlier observations on changing ligand binding affinities. Thus, the composition, and presumably properties, of embryonic/early postnatal rat GABAA receptors differs markedly from those expressed in the adult brain.",Excluded

1859,"Hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFX RT) followed by multiagent chemotherapy (CHT) in patients with malignant glioma: a phase II study. PURPOSE: Forty-eight patients with malignant glioma were treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy followed by multiagent chemotherapy to explore feasibility and toxicity of such combined modality treatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: There were 34 males and 14 females with a median age of 53 years (range, 32-74 years) and median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1 (range, 0-3). Histology included anaplastic astrocytoma in 11 patients and glioblastoma multiforme in 37 patients. Radiation was given at 1.2 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day, for a total dose of 72 Gy, with a reduction in field size after 52.8 Gy. Four weeks after completion of hyperfractionated radiation therapy multiagent chemotherapy was introduced with bischlorethyl nitrosourea (BCNU) 50 mg/m2, days 1-3, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (max. 2 mg), day 1, procarbazine 50 mg/m2, days 1-7 and cisplatin 20 mg/m2, days 1-3. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks to a maximum of six cycles or until tumor progression was noted.RESULTS: Median survival time for all patients was 52 weeks (range, 16-185 weeks) and median time to tumor progression was 30.5 weeks (range, 12-131 weeks). Besides age, histology, performance status, and extent of surgery, interfraction interval and location of tumor influenced survival in glioblastoma multiforms patients on univariate analysis: Patients treated with shorter intervals (4.5-5 h) did better than those treated with longer intervals (5.5-6 h); also, glioblastoma multiforme patients with frontal tumors did better than those with tumors of the other locations. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the performance status, interfraction interval, and tumor location were significant prognostic factors in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Acute toxicity was mild. No cases of brain necroses were observed.CONCLUSION: Hyperfractionated radiation therapy followed by multiagent chemotherapy was well tolerated with mild acute and virtually no late toxicity. More patients and longer follow-up are needed for further evaluation of its activity and late effects in anaplastic astrocytoma patients.",Excluded
2098,"Surgeon education decreases radiation dose in complex endovascular procedures and improves patient safety. OBJECTIVE: Complex endovascular procedures such as fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) are associated with higher radiation doses compared with other fluoroscopically guided interventions (FGIs). The purpose of this study was to determine whether surgeon education on radiation dose control can lead to lower reference air kerma (RAK) and peak skin dose (PSD) levels in high-dose procedures.METHODS: Radiation dose and operating factors were recorded for FGI performed in a hybrid room over a 16-month period. Cases exceeding 6 Gy RAK were investigated according to institutional policy. Information obtained from these investigations led to surgeon education focused on reducing patient dose. Points addressed included increasing table height, utilizing collimation and angulation, decreasing magnification modes, and maintaining minimal patient-to-detector distance. Procedural RAK doses and operating factors were compared 8 months pre- (group A) and 8 months post- (group B) educational intervention using analysis of variance with Tukey pairwise comparisons and t-tests. PSD distributions were calculated using custom software employing input data from fluoroscopic machine logs.RESULTS: Of 447 procedures performed, 300 FGIs had sufficient data to be included in the analysis (54% lower extremity, 11% thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair, 10% cerebral, 8% FEVAR, 7% endovascular aneurysm repair, 5% visceral, and 5% embolization). Twenty-one cases were investigated for exceeding 6 Gy RAK. FEVAR comprised 70% of the investigated cases and had a significantly higher median RAK dose compared with all other FGIs (P < .0001). There was no difference in body mass index between groups A and B; however, increasing body mass index was an indicator for increased RAK. PSD calculations were performed for the 122 procedures that focused on the thorax and abdomen (group A, 80 patients; group B, 42 patients). Surgeon education most strongly affected table height, with an average table height elevation of 10 cm per case after education (P < .0001). The dose index (PSD/RAK ratio) was used to track changes in operating practices, and it decreased from 1.14 to 0.79 after education (P < .0001). These changes resulted in an estimated 16% reduction in PSD. There was a trend toward a decrease in patient to detector distance, and the use of collimation increased from 25% to 40% (P < .001) for all cases; however, these did not result in a decrease in PSD. The number of cases that exceeded 6 Gy RAK did not change after education; however, the proportion of non-FEVAR cases that exceeded 6 Gy decreased from 40% to 20%.CONCLUSIONS: Surgeon education on the appropriate use of technical factors during FGIs improved operating practice, reduced patient radiation dose, and decreased the number of non-FEVAR cases that exceeded 6 Gy. It is essential that vascular surgeons be educated in best operating practices to lower PSD; nonetheless, FEVAR remains a high-dose procedure.",Excluded

The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (Atm) protein kinase is a central regulator of the cellular response to DNA damage. Although Atm can regulate p53, it is not known if this Atm function varies between tissues. Previous studies showed that the induction of p53 and apoptosis by whole-body ionizing radiation varies greatly between tissue and tumor types, so here we asked if Atm also had a tissue-specific role in the ionizing radiation response. Irradiated Atm-null mice showed impaired p53 induction and apoptosis in thymus, spleen, and brain. In contrast, radiation-induced p53, apoptosis, phosphorylation of Chk2, and G(2)-M cell cycle arrest were slightly delayed in Atm(-/-) epithelial cells of the small intestine but reached wild-type levels by 4 h. Radiation-induced p53 and apoptosis in Atm(-/-) hair follicle epithelial cells were not impaired at any of the time points examined. Thus, Atm is essential for radiation-induced apoptosis in lymphoid tissues but is largely dispensable in epithelial cells. This indicates that marked differences in DNA damage signaling pathways exist between tissues, which could explain some of the tissue-specific phenotypes, especially tumor suppression, associated with Atm deficiency.",Excluded
2393,"Clinical and histopathologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) after stereotactic radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma entails uncertain long-term risk of tumor recurrence and delayed cranial neuropathies. In addition, the underlying histopathologic changes to the tumor bed are not fully characterized. We seek to understand the clinical and histologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma after stereotactic radiation therapy.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Four patients who underwent microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannoma after primary stereotactic radiation therapy.INTERVENTION: Patients were treated primarily with gamma knife radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy followed by salvage microsurgery. Retrosigmoid craniotomy was used in all cases.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histopathologic review. Preoperative and postoperative facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann scale.RESULTS: We observed highly inconsistent radiation changes in the cerebellopontine angle and internal auditory canal. Fibrosis outside and within the tumor bed varied markedly, complicating microsurgical dissection. Light microscopy confirmed the presence of viable tumor in all cases. Histopathologic features were typical of vestibular schwannoma, and there was no significant scarring that could be attributed to radiation effect.CONCLUSIONS: The variable fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle and lack of radiation changes seen histopathologically in irradiated vestibular schwannoma suggest that a uniform treatment effect was not achieved in these cases. Although all four patients with preoperative cranial neuropathies were found intraoperatively to have fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle, excellent preservation of facial nerve anatomy and function was possible with salvage microsurgical resection. Additional analyses are needed to clarify the histopathologic and molecular characteristics associated with vestibular schwannoma growth after stereotactic radiation. [References: 58]",Excluded

Weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can induce long lasting changes in cortical excitability. In the present study we asked whether tDCS applied to the left primary motor cortex (M1) also produces aftereffects distant from the site of the stimulating electrodes. We therefore tested corticospinal excitability in the left and the right M1 and transcallosal excitability between the two cortices using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after applying tDCS. Eight healthy subjects received 10 min of anodal or cathodal tDCS (1 mA) to the left M1. We examined the amplitude of contralateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and the onset latency and duration of transcallosal inhibition with single pulse TMS. MEPs evoked from the tDCS stimulated (left) M1 were increased by 32% after anodal and decreased by 27% after cathodal tDCS, while transcallosal inhibition evoked from the left M1 remained unchanged. The effect on MEPs evoked from the left M1 lasted longer for cathodal than for anodal tDCS. MEPs evoked from the right M1 were unchanged whilst the duration of transcallosal inhibition evoked from the right M1 was shortened after cathodal tDCS and prolonged after anodal tDCS. The duration of transcallosal inhibition returned to control values before the effect on the MEPs from the left M1 had recovered. These findings are compatible with the idea that tDCS-induced aftereffects in the cortical motor system are limited to the stimulated hemisphere, and that tDCS not only affects corticospinal circuits involved in producing MEPs but also inhibitory interneurons mediating transcallosal inhibition from the contralateral hemisphere.",Excluded

As a proof of principle, we applied this technique to the motor cortex of transgenic mice expressing ChR2 in cortical pyramidal cells. Photostimulation induced limb movements that were time-locked with millisecond precision and could be induced at frequencies up to 20 Hz. By scanning this light beam, we could map the distribution of neurons associated with limb movement. With this approach we could simultaneously define motor maps controlling two limbs and could reproducibly generate such cortical motor maps over periods of weeks.

In congenitally deaf mice, ""auditory cortex"" contained neurons that responded to somatosensory, visual, or both somatosensory and visual stimulation; the primary visual area contained a larger proportion of neurons that responded to somatosensory stimulation than in normal animals, and the primary visual area had significantly increased in size. Thus, cortical architecture and functional specification were de-correlated. When results are considered in the light of molecular studies and studies in which peripheral activity is altered in development, it becomes clear that similar types of changes to the neocortex, such as alterations in cortical field size, can be achieved in more than one way in the developing and evolving neocortex.",Excluded

Purpose: The O-arm-based navigation increases the accuracy of pedicle screw positioning and offers the possibility of performing a 3D scan before wound closure. However, repeating the 3D scan exposes the patient to additional radiation. We combined O-arm navigation with pedicle screw (PS) stimulation followed by a 3D scan to evaluate their accuracy and aimed for the creation of a protocol that maximizes the safety and minimizes radiation. Method(s): Patients had pedicle screws insertion using O-arm spinal navigation, then had PS triggered electromyography (EMG), and finally a 3D scan to evaluate the accuracy of screw position. Result(s): 447 screws were inserted in 71 patients. In 10 patients, 11 screws needed repositioning. Comparing results of PS triggered EMG responses to the 3D scan, we found: (a) negative stimulation response with negative 3D scan findings, corresponding to 432 acceptable screw position (96.6 %) in 58 patients (81.7 %). In these cases, the redo 3D scan could be avoided. (b) Positive stimulation response with positive 3D scan findings, corresponding to 7 unacceptable screw position (1.5 %) in 6 patients (8.4 %). In these cases, PS stimulation detected malpositioned screws that would be missed without a redo 3D scan. Conclusion(s): We propose a protocol of routinely performing PS stimulation after screw insertion using spinal navigation. In case of positive stimulation, a 3D scan must be performed to rule out a probable screw mal position (6 patients 8.4 %). However, in case of negative stimulation, redo 3D scan can be avoided in 81.7 % of patients. Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans with a poor clinical outcome.

Therefore development of new targeted drugs and their combination with radiation offer new treatment possibilities. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the radiosensitizing abilities of ZRBA1combi-molecule designed to block bothEGFR-TKsignaling pathways while additionally inducing significant levels of DNA damage. In cancer cells the binary property ofZRBA1can be limited byDNArepair mechanismtherefore in order to increase its efficacy we combined this drug with ionizing radiation. The effect of ZRBA1 on the radiosensitivity of three human glioblastoma cell lines (U87, U343 and U373) was evaluated using MTT and clonogenic assays whereas DNA damage/repair and cell cycle were evaluated using gH2AX antibody and FACS assay. Our results demonstrate that exposure of cells to 25uM of ZRBA1 resulted in an increase in radiosensitivity of all tested cell lines with dose enhancement factors at a surviving fraction of 0.1 ranging from 1.4 to 1.7. Importantly, in contrast to Temozolomide which enhances radiation response most effectively in MGMT-negative cells, radiosensitizing proprieties of ZRBA1 does not depend on theMGMTmethylation status. Additionally, as a measure ofDNAdouble strand breaks, the number of gH2AXfoci per cell was significantly greater at 24h after the combined modality compared with the individual treatments with radiation, Temozolomide or ZRBA1 alone. Overall, our results have demonstrated of increased levels of DNA double strand breaks when ZRBA1 was combined with radiation and suggests that the radiosensitizing proprieties of ZRBA1 relay on inhibition of DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. Therefore we postulate that ZRBA1 may be developed as a potent and innovative radiosensitizing agent for malignant glioma tumors.",Excluded

Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common type of epilepsy in adults, is often medically refractory, and due to broad actions and long-time scales, current systemic treatments have major negative side-effects. However, temporal lobe seizures tend to arise from discrete regions before overt clinical behaviour, making temporally and spatially specific treatment theoretically possible. Here we report the arrest of spontaneous seizures using a real-time, closed-loop, response system and in vivo optogenetics in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Either optogenetic inhibition of excitatory principal cells, or activation of a subpopulation of GABAergic cells representing <5% of hippocampal neurons, stops seizures rapidly upon light application. These results demonstrate that spontaneous temporal lobe seizures can be detected and terminated by modulating specific cell populations in a spatially restricted manner.

CT (n=1) or MRI (n=66) images of 67 patients with a total of 437 treatment-naive brain metastases from breast cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were grouped according to the biological subtype of the tumor [luminal A, 28; luminal B, 9; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive, 14; triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), 16]. All images were standardized to the human brain MRI atlas provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 database. The distribution pattern of brain metastases after image standardization was analyzed. The cerebellum and the frontal lobe were more commonly affected by breast cancer brain metastases. Brain metastases from luminal A and B types of breast cancer arose more often in the cerebellum. Brain metastases from HER2-positive type breast cancer occurred more often in the putamen and the thalamus and less frequently in the cerebellum than other types (P=0.0057). The subtypes of breast cancer are related to differences in the spatial distributions of their brain metastases. These differences may be utilized to plan different cranial irradiation strategies according to the breast cancer subtypes. Copyright © 2021, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1745,"Electrophysiological characterisation of central sensitisation in canine spontaneous osteoarthritis. In man, central sensitisation (CS) contributes to the pain of osteoarthritis (OA). Dogs with spontaneous OA may also exhibit CS. Electrophysiological reflex measurements are more objective than behavioural assessments and can be used to evaluate CS in preclinical and clinical studies. It was hypothesised that dogs suffering from OA would exhibit electrophysiological characteristics indicative of CS, associated with reduced diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNICs). One hundred and seventeen client-owned dogs were recruited to the study. Hind limb nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds, stimulus response, and temporal summation characteristics were recorded, during alfaxalone anaesthesia, from 46 OA dogs, 29 OA dogs receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OANSAIDs), and 27 breed- and weight-matched control dogs. Efficacy of DNIC was evaluated in 12 control and 11 of the OA dogs, by application of a mechanical conditioning stimulus to the contralateral forelimb. Nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds were higher in OA compared with control dogs (P = 0.02). Stimulus response characteristics demonstrated an augmented response in OANSAID dogs compared with OA (P < 0.001) and control (P < 0.001) dogs. Temporal summation demonstrated exaggerated C-fibre-mediated responses in both OA (P < 0.001) and OANSAID (P = 0.005) groups, compared with control animals. Conditioning stimulus application resulted in inhibition of test reflex responses in both OA and control animals (P < 0.001); control animals demonstrated greater inhibition compared with OA (P = 0.0499). These data provide evidence of neurophysiological changes consistent with CS in dogs with spontaneous OA and demonstrate that canine OA is associated with reduced DNIC.",Excluded
1862,"The treatment options of recurred brain metastasis after prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with small-cell lung cancer. Background: Even after prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), many small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients succumb to brain metastasis. Brain metastasis after PCI is an unsolved issue in SCLC in terms of its dismal prognosis and the limitation of further treatment options. Regarding the treatment option, it is not determined whether re-whole brain radiotherapy (re-WBRT) is safe or gamma-knife surgery (GKS) has its role in SCLC. We investigated which treatment option could be recommended as the up-front therapy to improve survival for SCLC patients with brain metastasis who were previously treated with PCI. Method(s): The medical records were reviewed for SCLC patients who experienced brain metastases after receiving PCI from 2000 to 2010. We compared overall survival according to the modality of up-front therapy. Overall survival was determined as time from brain metastasis to death due to any cause. Result(s): In total, 245 patients had received PCI in a state of limited disease (n = 204) or extensive disease status (n = 41). Among them, 47 (19.2%) experienced brain metastases: 16.7% (34/204) in LD and 31.7% (13/41) in ED. At the time when brain metastasis developed, extracrainal disease was also on progressing state in 19 patients (40.4%). The modality of up-front therapy for brain metastasis was as follows: 17 (36.1%) got GKS, 14(29.8%) re-WBRT, 7 (14.9%) up-front chemotherapy without local therapy, and 9 (19.1%) did not receive any further treatment. The median overall survival after brain metastasis was 4.9 months. Among 31 patients who received GKS or re-WBRT, 10 patients received at least one subsequent chemotherapy in their lifetime after GKS (6/17, 35.3%) or re-WBRT (4/14, 28.6%). The median survival of GKS, re-WBRT and chemotherapy was 14.3, 3.9 and 6.0 months (P = 0.24), which showed the tendency favoring for up-front GKS. Although it failed to meet statistical significance. Conclusion(s): The up-front GKS showed longer survival in patients who experienced brain metastasis after PCI for SCLC, compared with re-WBRT or chemotherapy only. However, the number of participants was too small to get confirmatory results requiring a prospective therapy to demonstrate the role of GKS in this setting.",Excluded
1648,"Functional alterations in immature cultured rat hippocampal neurons after sustained exposure to static magnetic fields. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, gradual increases were seen in the expression of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), in proportion to increased duration, up to 9 days in vitro (DIV). Sustained exposure to static magnetic fields at 100 mT for up to 9 DIV significantly decreased expression of MAP-2 and NeuN in cultured rat hippocampal neurons without markedly affecting GAP-43 expression. Although a significant increase was seen in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampal neuronal preparations cultured for 6-9 DIV under sustained magnetism, GFAP and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression were not affected markedly in cultured astrocytes prepared from rat hippocampus and neocortex, irrespective of cellular maturity. No significant alteration was seen in cell survivability of hippocampal neurons or astrocytes cultured under sustained magnetism. In hippocampal neurons cultured for 3 DIV under sustained magnetism, marked mRNA expression was seen for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits, NR1, NR2A-2C, NR2D, and NR3A. In addition, significant potentiation of the ability of NMDA to increase intracellular free Ca(2+) ions was observed. Differential display analysis revealed a significant decrease in mRNA expression for the transcription factor ALF1 in response to sustained magnetism for 3 DIV. These results suggest that sustained exposure to static magnetic fields may affect cellular functionality and maturity in immature cultured rat hippocampal neurons through modulation of expression of particular NMDA receptor subunits.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Targeted therapy (TT) and immunotherapies (ITs) have dramatically improved survival in metastatic melanoma (MM). However, their efficacy on brain metastasis (BM) remains limited and poorly documented.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of consecutive MM patients (pts) with BMs, all systematically upfront treated by Gamma-Knife (GK) at first BM and retreated in case of new BMs, from 2010 to 2015 at the time when ipilimumab BRAF +/- MEK inhibitors and anti-PD1 were introduced in practice. Survival after 1st GK (OS<sub>GK1</sub>) according to prognostic factors and treatment.RESULTS: Among 179 consecutive pts treated by GK, 109 received IT and/or TT after the 1st GK. Median OS<sub>GK1</sub> was 10.95 months and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 49.5% and 27.4%, respectively, versus a median overall survival (OS) of 2.29 months (p < .001) in those who did not receive IT or TT. In pts who initially had a single BM, median OS and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 14.46 months, 66.7% and 43.4%, respectively; in pts with 2-3 BMs: 8.85 months, 46.4% and 31%, respectively; in pts with >3 BMs: 7.25 months, 37.2% and 11.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis for OS<sub>GK1</sub> confirmed that IT and TT were significantly and highly protective. Best OS<sub>GK1</sub> was observed in BRAF-wild-type pts receiving anti-PD1 or in BRAF-mutated pts receiving BRAF-inhibitors and anti-PD1 (12.26 and 14.82 months, respectively).CONCLUSION: In real-life MM pts with BMs, a strategy aiming at controlling BM with GK together with TT and/or TT seems to achieve unprecedented survival rates.",Excluded
1538,"The time course of the light-induced extracellular potassium change around receptors and at the vitreal surface compared with the time course of slow PIII wave in the isolated rabbit retina. The experimental preparation was a piece of isolated rabbit retina, the lower side of which was superfused in a chamber with a plasma-saline mixture kept at 35 degrees C to which, in some experiments, either sodium aspartate and glutamate, or Mg2+, were added to suppress second order neuronal activity. The upper side was exposed to an atmosphere of humidified oxygen. With longlasting light stimuli (30-180 s) the [K+]0 around receptors first falls from its dark-adaptation value (4.6 +/- 0.4 mM) to 3.3 +/- 0.6 mM and then reaccumulates nearly to the pre-stimulus value. The time course of reaccumulation varies greatly (30-180 s) between preparations. The peak time (90% value) of the [K+]0 decrease is several seconds. It seems that the more rapidly the retina is prepared the shorter the peak time of the [K+]0 reaccumulation and the more rapid the [K+]0 reaccumulation. This suggests that the [K+]0 reaccumulation is effected by active, oxygen-dependent mechanisms. PIII always precedes the [K+]0 change, its peak time is several 100 ms. During longlasting light stimuli (30-180 s) slow PIII reflects the difference in the [K+]0 changes around the photoreceptors and at the vitreal surface. The rapidly and carefully isolated preparations exhibit a slow cornea-positive potential similar to a c-wave, when second order neuronal activity is not suppressed.",Excluded
1831,"Non tumor perfusion changes following stereotactic radiosurgery to brain metastases. Purpose: To evaluate early perfusion changes in normal tissue following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Method(s): Nineteen patients harboring twenty-two brain metastases treated with SRS were imaged with dynamic susceptibility magnetic resonance imaging (DSC MRI) at baseline, 1 week and 1 month post SRS. Relative cerebral blood volume and flow (rCBV and rCBF) ratios were evaluated outside of tumor within a combined region of interest (ROI) and separately within gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) ROIs. Threedimensional dose distribution from each SRS plan was divided into six regions: (1) <2 Gy; (2) 2-5 Gy; (3) 5-10 Gy; (4) 10-12 Gy; (5) 12-16 Gy; and (6) >16 Gy. rCBV and rCBF ratio differences between baseline, 1 week and 1 month were compared. Best linear fit plots quantified normal tissue dose-dependency. Result(s): Significant rCBV ratio increases were present between baseline and 1 month for all ROIs and dose ranges except for WM ROI receiving <2 Gy. rCBV ratio for all ROIs was maximally increased from baseline to 1 month with the greatest changes occurring within the 5-10 Gy dose range (53.1%). rCBF ratio was maximally increased from baseline to 1 month for all ROIs within the 5-10 Gy dose range (33.9-45.0%). Both rCBV and rCBF ratios were most elevated within GM ROIs. A weak, positive but not significant association between dose, rCBV and rCBF ratio was demonstrated. Progressive rCBV and rCBF ratio increased with dose up to 10 Gy at 1 month. Conclusion(s): Normal tissue response following SRS can be characterized by dose, tissue, and time specific increases in rCBV and rCBF ratio. Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.",Excluded
2047,"Riluzole enhances ionizing radiation-induced cytotoxicity in human melanoma cells that ectopically express metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 in vitro and in vivo. PURPOSE: Brain metastases are a common preterminal event in patients with metastatic melanoma and require radiation therapy. Our group has previously shown that human GRM1 (hGRM1) expressing melanoma cells release excess extracellular glutamate and are growth inhibited by riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release. Riluzole-treated cells accumulate in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle at 24 hours, and then undergo apoptotic cell death. We evaluated whether riluzole enhanced radiosensitivity in melanoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clonogenic assays were performed to evaluate clonogenic survival after treatment in hGRM1 expressing and nonexpressing melanoma cells. Western immunoblots were performed to confirm apoptotic cell death. A xenograft mouse model was used to validate the in vitro experiments. Tumors harvested from the xenografts were fixed and stained for apoptosis and DNA damage markers.RESULTS: In the hGRM1-positive cell lines C8161 and UACC903, riluzole enhanced the lethal effects of ionizing radiation; no difference was seen in the hGRM1-negative UACC930 cell line. C8161 cells treated with riluzole plus irradiation also showed the highest levels of the cleaved forms of PARP and caspase-3; excised C8161 xenografts showed the greatest number of apoptotic cells by immunohistochemistry (P < 0.001). On cell cycle analysis, a sequence-dependent enrichment in the G(2)/M phase was shown with the combination of riluzole and irradiation. Xenografts treated with riluzole and weekly radiation fractions showed significant growth inhibition and revealed markedly increased DNA damage.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown, in vitro and in vivo, that the combination of riluzole and ionizing radiation leads to greater cytotoxicity.

1756,"Direct correlation between cardiac and striatal <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA uptake in de novo Parkinson's disease. Background Even at the early stage of Parkinson's Disease (PD) nuclear medicinetechniques, such as <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT SPECT and <sup>123</sup>I -MIBG scintigraphy, may reveal pathological findings, showing striatum and cardiac reduced uptake, respectively. This information about nigro-striatal and sympathetic cardiac neuronal loss may contribute to the early diagnosis of PD and provide relevant elements for differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndrome. The main limitation to investigate these different neuronal systems, is related to the need of two scans, with two tracers and double radiation exposure for patients. <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA is a dopamine precursor able to evaluate synthetic and storage capacity of dopamine in pre-synaptic terminals. This PET radiopharmaceutical is a sensitive bio-marker to assess nigro-striatal dysfunction and its diagnostic accuracy is comparable to those of <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT. However, <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA has never been validate so far as a biomarker of cardiac sympathetic denervation, despite its cardiac uptake. Our aim is evaluating the association between cardiac and striatal <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA uptake in de novo PD, in order to test whether it may be further evaluated as a biomarker of cardiac neuronal loss. Methods Sixteen patients with de novo PD were included in this study. Patients with history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. The patients were given carbidopa (2,5 mg/Kg) orally, and after 60 min, received 185 MBq of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA. PET/CT was acquired 90 min after the injection. Cardiac <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA-PET/CT was acquired at the end of brain scan. Automatic segmentation and semiquantification of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA striatal uptake was asses using basal ganglia matching tools package. Regions of interest were drawn over the heart and mediastinum. The ratio between the uptake in the left ventricle and mediastinum (H/M ratio) was recorded for each scan. Results Both in case of putamen (r=0.75, p=0.0009) and caudate (r=0.57, p=0.02) , a significant correlation between the more affected site of striatal uptake and H/M ratio was found. Direct correlation between striatal uptake and H/M ratio was confirmed also in the controlateral site (putamen: r=0.63, p= 0.0096; caudate: r=0.54, p=0.03). No significant inverse correlation was found between UPDRS III and H/M ratio (r=- 0.3630, p= 0.16). Conclusion These findings support the hypothesis that cardiac 18FDOPA uptake may be used as a biomarker of cardiac neuronal loss.

BACKGROUND: The neuropathological mechanism of heart rhythm disorders, following spinal cord pathologies, to our knowledge, has not yet been adequately investigated. In this study, the effect of the ischemic neurodegeneration of the thoracic sympathetic nuclei (TSN) on the heart rate (HR) was examined following a spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SSAH).METHODS: This study was conducted on 22 rabbits. Five rabbits were used as a control group, five as SHAM, and twelve as a study group. The animals' HRs were recorded via monitoring devices on the first day, and those results were accepted as baseline values. The HRs were remeasured after injecting 0.5 cc of isotonic saline for SHAM and 0.5 cc of autolog arterial blood into the thoracic spinal subarachnoid space at T4-T5 for the study group. After a three-week follow-up with continuous monitoring of their HRs, the rabbit's thoracic spinal cords and stellate ganglia were extracted. The specimens were evaluated by histopathological methods. The densities of degenerated neurons in the TSN and stellate ganglia were compared with the HRs.RESULTS: The mean HRs and mean degenerated neuron density of the TSN and stellate ganglia in control group were 251+/-18/min, 5+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 3+/-1/mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The mean HRs and the mean degenerated neuron density of the TSN and stellate ganglia were detected as 242+/-13/min, 6+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 4+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup> in SHAM (P>0.05 vs. control); 176+/-19/min, 94+/-12/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 28+/-6/mm<sup>3</sup> in the study group (P<0.0001 vs. control and P<0.005 vs. SHAM), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: SAH induced TSN neurodegeneration may have been responsible for low HRs following SSAH.

Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the early neurovascular alterations of the retina in radiation encephalopathy (RE) patients with normal-ranged visual acuity after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Method(s): Fifty-five RE patients and 54 healthy age-matched subjects were enrolled in this retrospective cross-sectional case-control study. The best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) of the included eye should not be more than 0. The vessel density and thickness of different locations in the retina were acquired automatically using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The data were then compared between the RE patients and the controls. The location included the whole retina, the superficial vascular plexus (SVP)/the ganglion cell complex (GCC), the deep vascular plexus (DVP), and the choroid in the macular area, as well as the inside disc and peripapillary area in the optic nerve head (ONH). The risk factors in OCTA retinal impairments were analyzed using a backward multiple linear regression. The relationships between mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) in the visual field (VF) and the OCTA parameters were also analyzed in RE patients. Result(s): The vessel density of the GCC was significantly reduced in RE patients compared with controls (p = 0.018), and the reductions were mainly shown in the parafoveal (p = 0.049) and perifoveal fields (p = 0.006). The thickness of the GCC was correspondingly reduced (whole image GCC mean thickness: p = 0.044; parafoveal thickness: p = 0.038; perifoveal thickness: p = 0.038). In addition, the sub-foveal choroidal thickness (p = 0.039) was also reduced in RE patients. The vessel density of the GCC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.643) and DVP (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.777) had a significant positive correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and had a significant negative correlation with age (GCC: HDL-C, beta = 29.89, p = 0.005; ApoA1, beta = 78.92, p = 0.002; age, beta = -0.886, p = 0.001; DVP: HDL-C, beta = 40.09, p = 0.003; ApoA1, beta = 62.65, p = 0.013; age, beta = -1.31, p = 0.001). The vessel density of the GCC also had a significant negative correlation with apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (beta = -32.18, p = 0.006). In the VF, MD had a significant positive correlation with the vessel density inside disc (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.241, beta = 0.304, p = 0.045), whereas PSD showed a significant negative correlation with the vessel density inside disc and the average GCC thickness, respectively (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.437; vessel density inside disc, beta = -0.358, p = 0.004; average GCC thickness, beta = -0.510, p < 0.001).

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT angiography and perfusion imaging is an important prognostic tool in the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of advanced imaging in patients with SAH, incorporating the risks of radiation exposure from CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The risks of radiation-induced brain cancer and cataracts were incorporated into our established decision model comparing the cost-effectiveness of CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging and transcranial Doppler sonography in SAH. Cancer risk was calculated by using National Cancer Institute methodology. The remaining input probabilities were based on literature data and a cohort at our institution. Outcomes were expected quality-adjusted life years gained, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging were the dominant strategies, resulting in both better health outcomes and lower costs, even when incorporating brain cancer and cataract risks. Our results remained robust in 2-way sensitivity analyses varying the prolonged latency period up to 30 years, with either brain cancer risk up to 50 times higher than the upper 95% CI limit or the probability of cataracts from 0 to 1. Results were consistent for scenarios that considered either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with SAH. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed our findings over a broad range of selected input parameters.CONCLUSIONS: While risks of radiation exposure represent an important consideration, CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging remained the preferred imaging compared with transcranial Doppler sonography in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SAH, with improved health outcomes and lower health care costs, even when modeling a significantly higher risk and shorter latency period for both cataract and brain cancer than that currently known.",Excluded

It's incidence increases with age, slightly more in men than women. Less than 20% live longer than 1 year. Method(s): We present a case of a female patient who was diagnosed with a colo-rectal cancer. The cancer was staged as pT-3, N-0, M-0, G-2, R-0. He underwent a surgical intervention with colo-anal anastomosis. Than he was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: 5-FU and radiation. He was followed -up at the outpatient clinic of surgery. Two years later the patient complaint of back pain. A CT scan was performed, which found a solid lesion of the body of the pancreas with peripancreatic and truncus celiacus infiltration. Multiple liver metastes were found. A thoracic CT scan revealed metastatic lesions of both lungs, 7-8 mm in diameter. In these conditions the clinical diagnosis was made: Pancreatic cancer with pulmonary and liver metastatis, diabetes mellitus. Result(s): The stratification of the cancer showed a Stage 4 B, non resecable. The celiac plexus was accessed percutaneosly.

1999,"Recent advances in neuro-imaging and the impact on neuro-ophthalmology. Neuro-imaging is an essential part of the evaluation in patients with neuro-ophthalmologic disorders. Over the last two decades enormous advances in this area have been made allowing noninvasive evaluation of the orbit and brain. The idea of using nuclear magnetic resonance technology to produce images rather than the ionizing radiation of computed tomography (CT) began to emerge clinically in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Although the quality of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was not much better than CT images, by the early 1990s, it became obvious that MRI had particular strength in identifying lesions in the posterior fossa, and demyelinating plaques. With advances in magnetic strength, computer software, surface coils, contrast medium, and more attention to the basic physics of magnet technology, the clarity of MR images improved dramatically. Recent advances in CT scanning (spiral and three-dimensional CT) and MRI (functional MRI and cine MRI) continue to affect significant changes in the discipline of neuro-ophthalmology. Furthermore, advances in MR angiography promise to allow excellent and noninvasive analysis of the cerebral vasculature. This review highlights the recent advances in neuro-imaging.

The effects of hematoporphyrin derivative, light, and cobalt 60 (60Co) irradiation were studied in a rat glioma model using an in vivo and an in vitro clonogenic assay. There was no effect on tumor growth by visible light or by a single dose of 60Co irradiation at 4 Gy or 8 Gy, whereas 16 Gy inhibited tumor growth to 40% versus the control. Hematoporphyrin derivative alone slightly stimulated growth (P less than 0.1). Light in the presence of 10 mg hematoporphyrin derivative/kg inhibited tumor growth to 32%. 60Co irradiation in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a significant tumor growth inhibition (P less than 0.02). This growth inhibition was directly related to the concentration of hematoporphyrin derivative. The addition of 60Co to light in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a greater growth inhibition than light or 60Co irradiation alone. This effect was most pronounced when light was applied 30 minutes before 60Co irradiation. Our experiments in a subcutaneous rat glioma model suggest a radiosensitizing effect of hematoporphyrin derivative. Furthermore, the photodynamic inactivation is enhanced by the addition of 60Co irradiation.

Major depression has a high incidence in patients with cancer, but treatment guidelines for this vulnerable population are missing and antidepressants seem to be less effective than in patients not affected by cancer. We report the case of a patient with bronchial cancer with a single temporo-occipital brain metastasis that had been treated by radiotherapy (whole-brain radiation, 40 Gy, followed by a stereotactic radiotherapy, 15 Gy). The patient developed a major depressive episode and was successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy without relevant adverse events. This case further underscores the safety and effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy after radiotherapy of the brain and demonstrates a viable alternative for severely depressed patients with cancer who do not adequately respond to psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone.",Excluded

Study of the patterns of the postradiation death of differentiating and proliferating cells in the subependymal zone of the rat brain. [Russian]. The post-irradiation cell kinetics was studied in vivo autoradiographically with 3H-thymidine, injected 60-80 minutes before the whole body X-irradiation of rats in doses of 50, 150 or 300 R. The wavy character of death was shown in the proliferating and differentiating rat's brain subependymal cells. After cell irradiation in G2- and S-phases four peaks of labeled mitotic cells with pycnotic nuclei (""mitotic death"") were recorded. The application of the double labelling technique with 3H- and 14C-thymidine showed that the lethally damaged cells irradiated in G1-phase had lost their ability to synthesize DNA. The nuclei of these cells became pycnotic later than 4 hours after irradiation, as follows indirectly from data recorded by Shmakova et al. (1972). The conformity in the time and alternation of the death peak appearance of differentiating cells and of the appearance of the death peaks and mitoses in proliferating cells enabled us to assume the persistence of the cycle (""short cycle"") in differentiating cells with the rhythm similar to that in the mitotic cycle. All the cells of the system were blocked during one hour, independently of the dose of irradiation, in one of six points of the cycle (mitotic cycle, short cycle). All these data suggest that the death of the differentiating cells and of cells which at the time of irradiation were in G1-phase could be timed to the final phase of the cycle (short cycle, mitotic cycle), coinciding in time with M-phase of the mitotic cycle.",Included
1857,"Irradiation induces glioblastoma cell senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and fatal primary brain tumors in humans. The standard therapy for the treatment of GBM is surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. However, the frequency of tumor recurrence in GBM patients is very high, and the survival rate remains poor. Delineating the mechanisms of GBM recurrence is essential for therapeutic advances. Here, we demonstrate that irradiation rendered 17-20 % of GBM cells dead, but resulted in 60-80 % of GBM cells growth-arrested with increases in senescence markers, such as senescence-associated beta-galactosidase-positive cells, H3K9me3-positive cells, and p53-p21(CIP1)-positive cells. Moreover, irradiation induced expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) mRNAs and NFkappaB transcriptional activity in GBM cells. Strikingly, compared to injection of non-irradiated GBM cells into immune-deficient mice, the co-injection of irradiated and non-irradiated GBM cells resulted in faster growth of tumors with the histological features of human GBM. Taken together, our findings suggest that the increases in senescent cells and SASP in GBM cells after irradiation is likely one of main reasons for tumor recurrence in post-radiotherapy GBM patients.",Excluded

2133,"Phase I/II trial of simultaneous whole-brain irradiation and dose-escalating topotecan for brain metastases. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Topotecan penetrates the blood-brain barrier and sensitizes tumor cells against radiation. A phase I/II dose-escalating trial of repetitive daily i. v. topotecan application simultaneously with whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) was conducted to estimate toxicity, maximum tolerated dose and survival in patients with inoperable brain metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 47 patients suffering from previously untreated brain metastases, topotecan was applied on a daily i. v. schedule simultaneously with WBRT (36 Gy/3-Gy fractions). The infusion schedule started at the beginning of WBRT and was discontinued during weekends. Each infusion was completed within 1-2 h before irradiation. In a dose-finding study, topotecan was escalated from 5 x 0.5 mg/m(2), 8 x 0.5 mg/m(2), 12 x 0.5 mg/m(2) to 12 x 0.6 mg/m(2).RESULTS: Altogether, 38/47 patients (81%) completed the prescribed schedule. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were dose-limiting. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 5/32 chemonaive patients (16%) and 7/15 patients (47%) with previous chemotherapy. At 12 x 0.6 mg/m(2), 2/4 patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia/thrombopenia. Nonhematologic toxicities were generally mild to moderate and unrelated to topotecan. Response evaluation was possible in 26/47 patients, overall response rate was 58% (CR [complete remission] 5/26, PR [partial remission] 10/26, NC [no change] 8/26). Median survival amounted to 5.1 months. In 15/42 patients (36%), brain metastases were the dominant cause of death.CONCLUSION: For a daily topotecan schedule simultaneous to WBRT, the maximum tolerated dose is 12 x 0.5 mg/m(2) in chemonaive patients. For chemo-pretreated patients, daily doses should be reduced to 0.4 mg/m(2). A phase III trial has now been started to find out whether WBRT + topotecan increases survival compared to WBRT alone.",Excluded

Continuous irradiation in utero is reported to produce mental retardation and gross abnormalities of the brain in the human. A few experimental studies conducted so far also report gross brain defects in animals exposed to continuous irradiation in utero. Despite the increasing use of nuclear energy for power and radioisotopes in medicine, there is hardly any literature available on the effect of continuous irradiation on the structural details of the developing brain. After intraperitoneal injections of different doses of 131I (8, 18 and 32 microCi) and 32P (10 microCi) in new-born rats on the 6th postnatal day, cerebella stained by Golgi techniques were cut sagittally and the sections were examined on the 10th, 15th and 21st postnatal days. In the animals injected with 18 and 32 microCi of 131I and 10 microCi of 32P a large number of Purkinje cells showed morphological alterations not seen in the control groups or in the groups injected with 8 microCi of 131I. The changes observed included persistence of the perisomatic processes beyond the 10th postnatal day, multiple primary dendrites, angulation of the primary dendrites, long segments of primary dendrites without branches and significantly reduced dendritic volume. The number of affected cells was less on the 21st postnatal day. The effective radiation dose estimated in these groups ranged from 15 to 26 rad. Since the rats irradiated with 6 rad had not shown such changes it is believed that there is a threshold dose of radiation beyond which only changes are perceptible at neuronal level.",Excluded
2194,"Modulation of rod photoreceptor potassium Kx current by divalent cations. Similarities between photoreceptor Kx channels and EAG and KCNQ channels suggest that the Kx channel may be related to one or both of these families of potassium channels. To provide a basis for further comparison of these channels, as well as to reveal the role of zinc (endogenously present in photoreceptors) in Kx channel modulation, we studied the effects of divalent cations on activation and kinetic properties of the noninactivating potassium current, I(Kx), in salamander rod photoreceptors. We found that divalent cations slowed the activation of I(Kx) and shifted its activation curve to positive potentials, effects attributable to surface charge screening. The effect of zinc on I(Kx) kinetics was considerably stronger than that expected from the activation curve shift alone. None of the divalent ions studied changed the monoexponential nature of I(Kx) activation. A simple model of a rod photoreceptor was created using NEURON software. In the model, zinc accelerated and sharpened the light response, broadening the frequency response of rod photoreceptors. Our results show that although the overall effects of divalent cations are in part due to surface charge screening effects, zinc also induced a specific change in I(Kx) activation kinetics, and this action profoundly alters rod response properties.",Excluded

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a systemic cytotoxic radiation therapy using a compound of beta-emitting radionuclide chelated to a peptide for the treatment of tumor with overexpressed specific cell receptor such as somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) of neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Surgical resection should be performed for the curative treatment for NETs when it is feasible; however, a multi-disciplinary approach is needed when locally advanced or metastasized disease. PRRT with lutetium-177 (Lu-177)-labeled somatostatin analogues, as a new treatment modality targeting metastatic or inoperable NETs expressing the SSTR2, have been developed and successfully used for the past two decades. As Lu-177 emits both beta- and gamma-radiation, it has the ability as a theragnostic agent for NETs compared with only beta-emitting yttrium-90 labeled PRRT. Several recent studies reported that Lu-177 gave an overall positive response and improved the patients' quality of life. To fully exploit its potential, large comparative studies are needed for the assessment of distinct efficacies of Lu-177 labeled PRRT. Additionally, for extending the indications and developing new regimens of Lu-177-based PRRT, more dedicated clinical research is required.

2362,"Celiac plexus radiosurgery: A new palliative modality for upper gastrointestinal malignancies-Final results of a proof-ofconcept clinical trial. Background: Many patients with upper-abdominal malignancies suffer from severe lower back pain radiating to the epigastrium, caused by infiltration of the celiac plexus. The celiac plexus is a network of nociceptive nerves, located along the aorta. Contemporary approaches (opioids, celiac plexus chemical neurolysis, systemic chemotherapy) are often inadequate. The celiac plexus has not previously been targeted using radiation. We hypothesized that ablative radiation targeted to the celiac plexus would alleviate pain. Method(s): We conducted a single arm prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients had celiac-pain > 4/10 on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), ECOG <= 3, no previous abdominal RT, and were evaluable if they completed treatment per protocol with at least one post-treatment visit. The celiac plexus was irradiated from D12 to L2. Radiation was given as either five fractions of 9 Gy or a single-fraction 25 Gy. The primary endpoint was NRS pain 3 weeks post-treatment. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, pain at 6w, analgesic use, and pain interference with daily activities as evaluated by 'Brief Pain Inventory' before and after radiation. Result(s): 21 patients were evaluable: 2 received fractionated treatment, 19 received 25Gy single fraction. The median age of the study population was 63 yr with a median ECOG of 1, 86% had pancreatic cancer. Patients were a median of 8 months out from diagnosis, and had received a median of one systemic treatment. Toxicity was limited to grade 1-2. All patients reported decreased celiac pain: median baseline pain was 6/10 (IQR 5-7.7), was reduced to 2.3/10 (IQR 0.9-3.9) (p < 0.0005) at 3w, and to 1.8/10 (IQR 0-3.2) (p < 0.0005) at 6w post-treatment. Seven patients reported their celiac pain had been eliminated entirely. Median morphine consumption decreased (NS). Improvement was seen in multiple quality of life measures, includ. total wellbeing (p = 0.0001), daily activity (p = 0.005) and sleep quality (p = 0.002).

2214,"Improved plan quality with automated radiotherapy planning for whole brain with hippocampus sparing: a comparison to the RTOG 0933 trial. BACKGROUND: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) with hippocampus sparing (HS) has been investigated by the radiation oncology working group (RTOG) 0933 trial for patients with multiple brain metastases. They showed a decrease of adverse neurocognitive effects with HS WBRT compared to WBRT alone. With the development of automated treatment planning system (aTPS) in the last years, a standardization of the plan quality at a high level was achieved. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using an aTPS for the treatment of HS WBRT and see if the RTOG 0933 dose constraints could be achieved and improved.METHODS: Ten consecutive patients treated with HS WBRT were enrolled in this study. 10 x 3 Gy was prescribed according to the RTOG 0933 protocol to 92% of the target volume (whole-brain excluding the hippocampus expanded by 5 mm in 3-dimensions). In contrast to RTOG 0933, the maximum allowed point dose to normal brain was significantly lowered and restricted to 36.5 Gy. All patients were planned with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique using four arcs. Plans were optimized using Auto-Planning (AP) (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems) with one single AP template and optimization.RESULTS: All the constraints from the RTOG 0933 trial were achieved. A significant improvement for the maximal dose to 2% of the brain with a reduction of 4 Gy was achieved (33.5 Gy vs. RTOG 37.5 Gy) and the minimum hippocampus dose was reduced by 10% (8.1 Gy vs. RTOG 9 Gy). A steep dose gradient around the hippocampus was achieved with a mean dose of 27.3 Gy at a distance between 0.5 cm and 1 cm from the hippocampus. The effective working time to optimize a plan was kept below 6'.CONCLUSION: Automated treatment planning for HS WBRT was able to fulfil all the recommendations from the RTOG 0933 study while significantly improving dose homogeneity and decreasing unnecessary hot spot in the normal brain. With this approach, a standardization of plan quality was achieved and the effective time required for plan optimization was minimized.",Excluded
1327,"Relationship between acoustic pressure used for BBB disruption and amount of MRI contrast agent delivered to the brain. Objectives: The acoustic intensity needs to be very well known to efficiently open the Blood-brain Barrier (BBB) since it is mainly ruled by the mechanical index [1]. Previous studies have shown that a narrow range of peak negative pressure (PNP) is acceptable, corresponding to sufficient stable cavitation of injected microbubbles without reaching inertial cavitation responsible for irreversible damages. Within this range, only few data are available about how the pressure affects the strength of BBB disruption that is to say the amount of delivered drugs. We propose two new methods to evidence the opening threshold in vivo and measure this relationship after a MRI controlled protocol of the BBB opening: 1) Several different pressures are used at several brain locations during the same BBB opening session 2) A single point focal opening is performed and the brain uptake of contrast agent is correlated in each voxel with the pressure estimated from a MR-acoustic radiation force image [2]. Methods We use our previously introduced motorized MR-compatible FUS sys-tem [3] (Image Guided Therapy, France). An 8 channel annular array transducer operating at 1.5MHz (Imasonic, France) was calibrated in a water tank and acoustic transmission factors through rat skulls were measured in another study. This ability to shrewdly control the pressure we deliver in vivo in the brain is crucial for the two proposed methods. Fisher F344 rats (n=5, body weight=220g) were shaved and installed in the MRI bed of a 7T MRI scanner (Bruker) under isoflurane anesthesia. The transducer was coupled to the head with echographic gel. In a first experiment, after intravenous injection of microbubbles (Sonovue), a square trajectory was played with the transducer continuously shooting. 4 different pressures (0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 MPa) were applied on the 4 sides of the square. The transducer was moving at 10 mm/s, the size of the square was 5 mm and the trajectory was played 60 times. Then a 200muL Gadolinium based MRI contrast agent (Dotarem, Guerbet, France) was intravenously injected, at different time after the opening (10 minutes, 4 hours and 24 hours), and its uptake into the brain was quantitatively measured thank to T<inf>1</inf> maps. In a second experiment, the BBB was focally open with 0.6 MPa peak negative pressure at focus. Before the opening session, an Acoustic Radiation Force Image was acquired in order to estimate in vivo the pressure applied in each voxel during the BBB opening. After the opening, Dotarem was intravenously injected and the contrast agent concentration was measured in each voxel by acquiring T<inf>1</inf> maps [4]. The concentration in each voxel is then correlated to the pressure which has been used in this voxel to open the BBB. Results The first experiment with the square trajectory gives a rough estimation of the pressure threshold. Indeed it appears clearly (see Fig. 130) that the BBB is not open on the 0.25 and 0.35 MPa sides while it is open on the 0.45 and 0.55 MPa sides. The acoustic threshold must be between 0.35 and 0.45 MPa. With the second injection, we also found that the BBB was already close as soon as 4 hours after the opening even for the 0.55 MPa region. The second experiment gives a more accurate estimation of the pressure threshold. By plotting the concentrations in contrast agent in the voxel versus the pressure used in these voxel to open the BBB (see Fig. 131), two trends are observables. In a first pressure range, from 0 to 0.4 MPa, the pressure is not sufficient to open the BBB so the concentration is not significant. In a higher pressure range, from 0.4 MPa to 0.6MPa, the pressure is sufficient to open the BBB and the concentration increases as the pressure increases in a roughly linear way. With this experiment the found pressure threshold is about 0.4 MPa. A third way of determining the opening threshold is to study the width of the opening on the sides [LB1] of the square of the first ex-periment. Indeed it is possible to plot the concentration profile across the lines of the opening and t compare it to the Gaussian profile of the pressure which has been studied in water tank. It appeared that the width where the BBB is open matches with the width on the Gaussian profile where the pressure is higher than 0.4 MPa. Conclusions The two different methods proposed for the study of the dependency of drug uptake after BBB disruption with acoustic pressure give consistent results. We find an acoustic pressure threshold for the BBB opening of 0.4 MPa, for a 1.5 MHz working frequency. This result is in good accordance with the literature [5]. By acquiring T2 weighted images after those experiments, we are confident we caused no damages up to 0.6 MPa. This pressure is close to the one for which adverse effects started to appear in our previous studies thought. As a consequence, the pressure window for a safe and efficient BBB opening is quite narrow which highlights that the pressure in vivo has to be very well controlled. [LB1] Above the opening threshold, the relationship between drug uptake and acoustic pressure is linear. The knowledge of this relationship is key in order to predict drug pharmacokinetics after BBB disruption.",Excluded
2130,"2MO Radiotherapy in cancer is associated with a deletion signature that contributes to poor patient outcomes. Background: Diffuse gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumors that invariably relapse despite treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy. Treatment with alkylating chemotherapy can drive tumors to develop a hypermutator phenotype. In contrast, the genomic effects of radiation therapy (RT) remain unknown. Method(s): We analyzed the mutational spectra following treatment with ionizing radiation in sequencing data from 190 paired primary-recurrent gliomas from the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) dataset and 2249 post-treatment metastatic tumors from the Hartwig Medical Foundation. Result(s): We identified a significant increase in the burden of small deletions following radiation therapy that was independent of other factors. These novel deletions demonstrated distinct characteristics when compared to pre-existing deletions present prior to RT-treatment and deletions in RT-untreated tumors. Radiation therapy-acquired deletions were characterized by a larger deletion size (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=1.2e-02 and P=8e-11, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test), an increased distance to repetitive DNA elements (P<2.2e-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and a reduction in microhomology at breakpoints (P=3.2e-02, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These observations suggested that canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) was the preferred pathway for DNA double strand break repair of RT-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, radiotherapy resulted in frequent chromosomal deletions and significantly increased frequencies of CDKN2A homozygous deletions. Finally, a high burden of RT-associated deletions was associated with worse clinical outcomes (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=4.7e-02, HR=2.59 [95% CI: 1.01, 6.60] and P=2.5e-02, HR=1.43 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.94], respectively; multivariable Cox regression). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that effective repair of RT-induced DNA damage is detrimental to patient survival and that inhibiting c-NHEJ may be a viable strategy for improving the cancer-killing effect of radiotherapy. Taken together, the identified genomic scars as a result of radiation therapy reflect a more aggressive tumor with increased levels of resistance to follow up treatments.

2277,"Malignant melanoma-a rare cause of metastatic pancreatic cancer. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Diagnosing metastatic malignant melanoma after resection of superficial melanoma. CASE: A 56-year-old Caucasian female who is a practicing minister started behaving unusually during one of her services. She began walking up to the alter at inappropriate times and her family was concerned about her behavior. This change in mentation continued into the next day and the decision was made to bring her to the hospital. The patient had a history of superficial malignant melanoma to the left axilla, which was treated with axillary dissection 13 years ago. Sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time was negative and the patient did not receive any further chemotherapy or radiation. She was monitored for 5 years with serial PET scans every 6 months along with chest Xrays, routine blood work and annual skin exams without evidence of disease recurrence. On this presentation, the patient had multiple episodes of tonicclonic seizures while in the ED for which she was given Ativan, Versed and IV Keppra. The patient denied previous CNS symptoms including headache, seizures, or vision changes. Imaging of the head revealed a large hemorrhagic frontal temporal brain lesion with smaller scattered lesions concerning for metastatic disease. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a 2.2 x 1.6 cm peripancreatic tail mass. An endoscopic ultrasound was performed which showed a mass in the region of the tail of the pancreas. FNA was done with pathology positive for metastatic melanoma. Patient was referred to Oncology service for further management. IMPACT: Most pancreatic metastases occur in the first 1-3 years after treatment of the primary tumor and current guidelines recommend follow up 3-5 years thereafter. This case report raises a question about how long patient should be monitored after the successful treatment of superficial malignant melanoma. DISCUSSION: A variety of primary neoplasms metastasize to the pancreas. About 2% of pancreatic tumors are metastatic tumors. Common metastatic sites include the kidney, lung and colon. Metastasis of malignant melanoma to pancreas occurs as manifestation of widespread disease burden. Several factors influence survival in patients with primary melanoma, including specific clinical and pathological factors, histological subtype, anatomical location and lymph node involvement. Prognostic factors influencing survival in patients with malignant melanoma are largely unknown, but a longer disease free interval between the successful resection of primary malignancy and eventual development of metastasis to the pancreas has been reported to be associated with improved survival. Our patient presented 13 years following the treatment of primarymelanoma. The prognosis of metastatic malignant melanoma is poor. Studies suggest amean survival of only 6- 8 months in patients with systemic disease from melanoma. In several case series five-year survival rates are reported at less than 10%.",Excluded
1448,"Dose painting with Gamma Knife: Two techniques for delivering different doses to areas of recurrent or residual tumor after resection of brain metastases. Purpose: We investigated the feasibility of using Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery for ""dose painting"" to deliver higher doses to residual or recurrent nodules and surgical cavity after resection of brain metastases. Methods and materials: Two integrated boost techniques were developed with GK. The single-target technique delineated both the surgical cavity (cavity) and gross disease (nodule) as a single target. Dose was prescribed to the target with the goal of covering the nodule with a higher dose. The 2-target technique delineated the cavity and nodule as separate target volumes, each prescribed to its own dose and planned separately. Two cases were used to illustrate each technique. The single-target technique was used to deliver 16 Gy to a smaller cavity (7 cm<sup>3</sup>) and a 20-Gy integrated boost to 2 nodules (case 1). The 2-target technique was used to deliver 12 Gy to a larger cavity (21.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) and 20 Gy to a single nodule (case 2). Result(s): For both cases, the cavity coverage with the prescribed dose was 100% with the standard plan and integrated boost techniques. For case 1, compared with a standard plan, the single-target technique improved the 20-Gy nodule coverage from 89.7% (nodule 1) and 97.9% (nodule 2) to 100% (both) and increased the minimum dose from 16.6 Gy to 20.8 Gy (nodule 1) and from 19.4 Gy to 20.8 Gy (nodule 2). For case 2, compared with a standard plan, the 2-target technique improved the 20-Gy nodule coverage from 4% to 100% and the minimum dose from 13.8 Gy to 21 Gy. Conclusion(s): Both GK integrated boost approaches allowed for effective delivery of higher doses to residual or recurrent nodules in a surgical cavity. In our experience, the single-target technique works well for small cavities, whereas the 2-target technique is well suited for larger cavities.

1943,"Test of the paired-flash electroretinographic method in mice lacking b-waves. Previous studies of rod photoreceptors in vivo have employed a paired-flash electroretinographic (ERG) technique to determine rod response properties. To test whether absence versus presence of the ERG b-wave affects the photoreceptor response derived by the paired-flash method, we examined paired-flash-derived responses obtained from nob mice, a mutant strain with a defect in signal transduction between photoreceptors and ON bipolar cells that causes a lack of the b-wave. Normal littermates of the nob mice served as controls. The normalized amplitude-intensity relation of the derived response determined in nob mice at the near-peak time of 86 ms was similar to that determined for the controls. The full time course of the derived rod response was obtained for test flash strengths ranging from 0.11 to 17.38 scotopic cd s m(-2) (sc cd s m(-2)). Time-course data obtained from nob and control mice exhibited significant but generally modest differences. With saturating test flash strengths, half-recovery times for the derived response of nob versus control mice differed by approximately 60 ms or less about the combined (nob and control) average respective values. Time course data also were obtained before versus after intravitreal injection of L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB) (which blocks transmission from photoreceptors to depolarizing bipolar cells) and of cis 2,3-piperidine dicarboxylic acid (PDA) (which blocks transmission to OFF bipolar cells, and to horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells). Neither APB nor PDA substantially affected derived responses obtained from nob or control mice. The results provide quantitative information on the effect of b-wave removal on the paired-flash-derived response in mouse. They argue against a substantial skewing effect of the b-wave on the paired-flash-derived response obtained in normal mice and are consistent with the notion that, to good approximation, this derived response represents the isolated flash response of the photoreceptors in both nob and normal mice.",Excluded

Alternative management strategies should be pursued for T2b glottis carcinomas.",Excluded
2166,"Radiobiological characteristics for the medical proton beam with an energy of 1000 mev. [German]. The effects MeV a narrow proton beam with an energy of 1000 mew were studied with the survival test in a phantom behind 7 g/cm<sup>2</sup> of mass on the haploid prototrophic strain of yeast-cells and by the response of canine cerebral tissue in the area of the central ray and at the edge of the range of action. Following the survival test the relative biological effectiveness (RBW) after the action of primary protons and of secondary particles on yeast-cells was estimated for the depth studied with approximately 1 related to the therapeutic X-radiation. The damaging radiation effect to yeast-cells was found to be limited to a distance of 60 mm which nearly corresponds to the 0.1-0.2% isodose with a dose in the middle of 1,000,000 rad. The effect on the brain consists of circumscript necroses in the area of radiation focussing and a narrow about 1 mm wide area of perifocal changes. The neighbouring cerebral structures, on the other hand, possess a high integrity. The authors give reasons for the possible use of a proton beam for stereotactical interventions with the application of rotation-convergence irradiation technique.",Excluded

1854,"Cerebellar Liponeurocytoma with an Unusually Aggressive Clinical Course: Case Report. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Liponeurocytomas are rare cerebellar neoplasms in adults, with benign histological features and a favorable clinical prognosis. Current clinical opinion is based on a total of less than 20 published cases and suggests that gross total resection and long-term follow-up monitoring, with possible additional surgery and radiotherapy for treatment of recurrent tumors, represent the best treatment approach for this relatively benign tumor type. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old Caucasian woman presented with worsening unsteady gait and headaches, suggesting increased intracranial pressure. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent subtotal resection of a cerebellar liponeurocytoma, followed by fractionated radiotherapy (total dose of 54 Gy). She experienced a local recurrence of the tumor 12 months later and underwent additional surgery for removal of the cerebellar mass. A second recurrent tumor was diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging scans 3 months later and was surgically resected. The tumor histological findings were consistently devoid of atypical features, apart from leptomeningeal invasion noted in the first surgical specimen. CONCLUSION(S): This unusual case demonstrated an atypical clinical course of a highly aggressive and radiation-resistant tumor, despite the consistent absence of aggressive histological features. Cerebellar liponeurocytomas may not be as benign as the current literature and typical low-grade cytological and histological features suggest.",Excluded

Objective(s): To study the protective effects of intravascular low dose laser irradiation to ischemic reperfusion of rats and explore its mechanism. Design(s): A randomised and controlled trial based on experimental animals. Setting(s): Department of Neurology of a hospital of a university. Materials: The experiment was completed in the Surgery Experimental Animal Center of West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Healthy male SD rats of class II which aged between 5 to 6 months with weight of 372 to 418 grams [mean weight(388.48 +/- 10. 57) g] were provided by Animal Research Center of Sichuan University.

2364,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight. Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded
1815,"Genetic and firefly metaheuristic algorithms for an optimized neuro-fuzzy prediction modeling of wildfire probability. In the terrestrial ecosystems, perennial challenges of increased frequency and intensity of wildfires are exacerbated by climate change and unplanned human activities. Development of robust management and suppression plans requires accurate estimates of future burn probabilities. This study describes the development and validation of two hybrid intelligence predictive models that rely on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA) and firefly algorithm (FA), for the spatially explicit prediction of wildfire probabilities. A suite of ten explanatory variables (altitude, slope, aspect, land use, rainfall, soil order, temperature, wind effect, and distance to roads and human settlements) was investigated and a spatial database constructed using 32 fire events from the Zagros ecoregion (Iran). The frequency ratio model was used to assign weights to each class of variables that depended on the strength of the spatial association between each class and the probability of wildfire occurrence. The weights were then used for training the ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-FA hybrid models. The models were validated using the ROC-AUC method that indicated that the ANFIS-GA model performed better (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.92; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.91) than the ANFIS-FA model (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.89; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.88). The efficiency of these models was compared to a single ANFIS model and statistical analyses of paired comparisons revealed that the two meta-optimized predictive models significantly improved wildfire prediction accuracy compared to the single ANFIS model (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.82; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.78). We concluded that such predictive models may become valuable toolkits to effectively guide fire management plans and on-the-ground decisions on firefighting strategies.

2361,"Effect of gravity and microgravity on intracranial pressure. KEY POINTS: Astronauts have recently been discovered to have impaired vision, with a presentation that resembles syndromes of elevated intracranial pressure on Earth. Gravity has a profound effect on fluid distribution and pressure within the human circulation. In contrast to prevailing theory, we observed that microgravity reduces central venous and intracranial pressure. This being said, intracranial pressure is not reduced to the levels observed in the 90 deg seated upright posture on Earth. Thus, over 24 h in zero gravity, pressure in the brain is slightly above that observed on Earth, which may explain remodelling of the eye in astronauts.ABSTRACT: Astronauts have recently been discovered to have impaired vision, with a presentation that resembles syndromes of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). This syndrome is considered the most mission-critical medical problem identified in the past decade of manned spaceflight. We recruited five men and three women who had an Ommaya reservoir inserted for the delivery of prophylactic CNS chemotherapy, but were free of their malignant disease for at least 1 year. ICP was assessed by placing a fluid-filled 25 gauge butterfly needle into the Ommaya reservoir. Subjects were studied in the upright and supine position, during acute zero gravity (parabolic flight) and prolonged simulated microgravity (6 deg head-down tilt bedrest). ICP was lower when seated in the 90 deg upright posture compared to lying supine (seated, 4 +/- 1 vs. supine, 15 +/- 2 mmHg). Whilst lying in the supine posture, central venous pressure (supine, 7 +/- 3 vs. microgravity, 4 +/- 2 mmHg) and ICP (supine, 17 +/- 2 vs. microgravity, 13 +/- 2 mmHg) were reduced in acute zero gravity, although not to the levels observed in the 90 deg seated upright posture on Earth. Prolonged periods of simulated microgravity did not cause progressive elevations in ICP (supine, 15 +/- 2 vs. 24 h head-down tilt, 15 +/- 4 mmHg). Complete removal of gravity does not pathologically elevate ICP but does prevent the normal lowering of ICP when upright. These findings suggest the human brain is protected by the daily circadian cycles in regional ICPs, without which pathology may occur.",Excluded

1722,"Opposite effects of tetanic stimulation of the auditory thalamus or auditory cortex on the acoustic startle reflex in awake rats. The amygdala mediates both emotional learning and fear potentiation of startle. The lateral amygdala nucleus (LA) receives auditory inputs from both the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus; MGN) and auditory association cortex (AAC), and is critical for auditory fear conditioning. The central amygdala nucleus, which has intra-amygdaloid connections with LA, enhances startle magnitude via midbrain connections to the startle circuits. Tetanic stimulation of either MGN or AAC in vitro or in vivo can induce long-term potentiation in LA. In the present study, behavioural consequences of tetanization of these auditory afferents were investigated in awake rats. The acoustic startle reflex of rats was enhanced by tetanic stimulation of MGN, but suppressed by that of AAC. All the tetanization-induced changes of startle diminished within 24 h. Blockade of GABAB receptors in the LA area reversed the suppressive effect of tetanic stimulation of AAC on startle but did not change the enhancing effect of tetanic stimulation of MGN. Moreover, transient electrical stimulation of MGN enhanced the acoustic startle reflex when it lagged behind acoustic stimulation, but inhibited the acoustic startle reflex when it preceded acoustic stimulation. The results of the present study indicate that MGN and AAC afferents to LA play different roles in emotional modulation of startle, and AAC afferents are more influenced by inhibitory GABAB transmission in LA.",Excluded
2388,"Initial Gamma Knife radiosurgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. OBJECT: Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) are the most common type of pituitary adenoma and, when symptomatic, typically require surgical removal as an initial means of management. Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an alternative therapeutic strategy for patients whose comorbidities substantially increase the risks of resection. In this report, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of initial GKRS for NFAs.METHODS: An international group of three academic Gamma Knife centers retrospectively reviewed outcome data in 569 patients with NFAs.RESULTS: Forty-one patients (7.2%) underwent GKRS as primary management for their NFAs because of an advanced age, multiple comorbidities, or patient preference. The median age at the time of radiosurgery was 69 years. Thirty-seven percent of the patients had hypopituitarism before GKRS. Patients received a median tumor margin dose of 12 Gy (range 6.2-25.0 Gy) at a median isodose of 50%. The overall tumor control rate was 92.7%, and the actuarial tumor control rate was 94% and 85% at 5 and 10 years postradiosurgery, respectively. Three patients with tumor growth or symptom progression underwent resection at 3, 3, and 96 months after GKRS, respectively. New or worsened hypopituitarism developed in 10 patients (24%) at a median interval of 37 months after GKRS. One patient suffered new-onset cranial nerve palsy. No other radiosurgical complications were noted. Delayed hypopituitarism was observed more often in patients who had received a tumor margin dose > 18 Gy (p = 0.038) and a maximum dose > 36 Gy (p = 0.025).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, GKRS resulted in long-term control of NFAs in 85% of patients at 10 years. This experience suggests that GKRS provides long-term tumor control with an acceptable risk profile. This approach may be especially valuable in older patients, those with multiple comorbidities, and those who have endocrine-inactive tumors without visual compromise due to mass effect of the adenoma.",Excluded

This experimental study was done on 80 male Wistar rats that were allocated into exposure and sham groups. Wi-Fi exposure to 2.4 GHz microwaves [in Service Set Identifier mode (23.6 dBm and 3% for power and duty cycle, respectively)] was done for 30 days (12 h/day). Cross-modal visual-tactile object recognition (CMOR) task was performed by four variations of spontaneous object recognition (SOR) test including standard SOR, tactile SOR, visual SOR, and CMOR tests. A discrimination ratio was calculated to assess the preference of animal to the novel object. The expression levels of M1 and GAT1 mRNA in the hippocampus were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Results demonstrated that rats in Wi-Fi exposure groups could not discriminate significantly between the novel and familiar objects in any of the standard SOR, tactile SOR, visual SOR, and CMOR tests. The expression of M1 receptors increased following Wi-Fi exposure. In conclusion, results of this study showed that chronic exposure to Wi-Fi electromagnetic waves might impair both unimodal and cross-modal encoding of information.",Excluded

Although male Caenorhabditis elegans copulation can be perturbed in the presence of stress, the mechanisms underlying its decision to sustain copulation are unclear. Here we describe a mating interference assay, which quantifies the persistence of male C. elegans copulation in noxious blue light. We show that between copulations, the male escapes from blue light illumination at intensities over 370 muW mm(-2). This response is attenuated in mutants with constitutive activation of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor family homologue SEB-3. We show that activation of this receptor causes sex-common glutamatergic lumbar ganglion interneurons (LUA) to potentiate downstream male-specific reproduction circuits, allowing copulatory behaviours to partially override the light-induced escape responses in the male. SEB-3 activation in LUA also potentiates copulation during mild starvation. We suggest that SEB-3 activation allows C. elegans to acclimate to the environment and thus continue to execute innate behaviours even under non-optimal conditions.",Excluded

The previously reported increased sensitivity to painful stimuli subsequent to medial forebrain bundle lesions or para-chlorophenylalanine administration, therefore, does not appear to be due exclusively to disruption of ascending 5-HT fibers originating in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei.

PURPOSE: We investigated whether a 3D overlay roadmap using monoplane fluoroscopy offers advantages over a conventional 2D roadmap using biplane fluoroscopy during endovascular aneurysm treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for 131 consecutive cerebral aneurysm embolizations by three neurointerventionalists at a single institution. Allowing for a transition period, the periods from January 2012 to August 2012 (Time Period 1) and February 2013 to July 2013 (Time Period 2) were analyzed for radiation exposure, contrast administration, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, angiographic results, and perioperative complications. Two neurointerventionalists (Group 1) used a conventional 2D roadmap for both Time Periods, and one neurointerventionalist (Group 2) transitioned from a 2D roadmap during Time Period 1 to a 3D overlay roadmap during Time Period 2.RESULTS: During Time Period 2, Group 2 demonstrated reduced fluoroscopy time (p<0.001), procedure time (P=0.023), total radiation dose (p=0.001), and fluoroscopy dose (P=0.017) relative to Group 1.

Introduction: Parkinson disease (PD), pure autonomic failure (PAF), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are characterized by intra-cerebral deposition of the protein alpha-synuclein and are termed synucleinopathies. Lewy body synucleinopathies involve decreased cardiac sympathetic innervation and functional abnormalities in residual noradrenergic terminals. This observational, retrospective, cohort study describes long-term trends in indices of cardiac sympathetic innervation and function in synucleinopathies. Method(s): Patients with PD (N = 31), PAF (N = 9), or MSA (N = 9) underwent repeated <sup>18</sup>F-dopamine positron emission tomography (median follow-up 3.5 years). Interventricular septal <sup>18</sup>F-dopamine-derived radioactivity 8 min after tracer injection (8' Radioactivity) was used as an index of sympathetic innervation and the slope of mono-exponential decline of radioactivity between 8 and 25 min (k<inf>8'-25'</inf>) as an index of intraneuronal vesicular storage. Healthy volunteers (HVs) (N = 33) and individuals at high risk of PD (N = 15) were controls. Result(s): Upon initial evaluation the groups with PD and orthostatic hypotension (OH), PAF, or PD and no OH had low mean 8' Radioactivity compared to HVs (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0002, p = 0.006) and had elevated k<inf>8'-25'</inf> (p = 0.0007, p = 0.007, p = 0.06). There was no significant difference between MSA and HVs. In PD 8' Radioactivity decreased by a median of 4% per year and did not decrease in MSA. k<inf>8'-25'</inf> values did not change during follow-up in any group. Conclusion(s): Neuroimaging evidence of decreased vesicular uptake in cardiac sympathetic nerves is present upon initial evaluation of patients with Lewy body synucleinopathies and may provide a biomarker of catecholaminergic dysfunction early in the disease process.

Deformation of trachea through surgical process and mechanical applications induces injury of laryngotracheal mucosa (Hussain et al. 2015). Results of recent studies studying the oxidative related values in larynx cancer indicated the importance of oxidative stress. Main reactive oxygen species (ROS) are superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. Production normal level of ROS is a physiological process, because the ROS has been using for physiological functions such as killing bacteria and viruses in the body. The excessive production of ROS is scavenged by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. 900 and 1800 MHz frequencies are used in cell phones in several countries including Turkey, although 2450 MHz has been using as Wi-Fi frequency in the countries.

AIM: Urogenital dysfunction is a common sequela following total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. This prospective study analyzed potential risk factors and investigated the impact of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring.METHOD: Included were 85 patients undergoing total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, 43 under the control of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring. Urogenital function was assessed with validated questionnaires within a 2-year follow-up period. Potential risk factors were identified by multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Overall, approximately one-third of treated patients suffered from new onset of urinary dysfunction. Initially, half of the sexually active patients were affected by sexual dysfunction; after 2 years, almost three quarters were affected. In the pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring group, urinary and sexual dysfunction rates including minor and major disturbances were significantly lower (2-year follow-up 20% vs. 51% (p = 0.004) and 56% vs. 90% (p = 0.010)). Throughout the survey, non-performance of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring was found to be an independent risk factor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was identified as an independent predictor for urogenital dysfunction in the further course one and 2 years after surgery.CONCLUSION: Pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with significantly lower rates of urinary and sexual dysfunction in the short and long run, whereas neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has a negative impact only in the long run.",Excluded
2147,"Risk of defeats in the central nervous system during deep space missions. Space flight factors (SFF) significantly affect the operating activity of astronauts during deep space missions. Gravitational overloads, hypo-magnetic field and ionizing radiation are the main SFF that perturb the normal activity of the central nervous system (CNS). Acute and chronic CNS risks include alterations in cognitive abilities, reduction of motor functions and behavioural changes. Multiple experimental works have been devoted to the SFF effects on integrative functional activity of the brain; however, the model parameters utilized have not always been ideal and consistent. Even less is known regarding the combined effects of these SFF in a real interplanetary mission, for example to Mars. Our review aims to systemize and analyse the last advancements in astrobiology, with a focus on the combined effects of SFF; as well as to discuss on unification of the parameters for ground-based models of deep space missions.",Excluded

Cardiovascular responses to electrical stimulation of the periventricular/periaqueductal grey matter were measured in 15 awake human study participants following implantation of deep brain stimulating electrodes for treatment of chronic pain. We found that stimulation of the ventral periventricular/periaqueductal grey matter caused a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 14.2+/-3.6 mmHg in seven patients and stimulation of the dorsal periventricular/periaqueductal grey matter caused a mean increase of 16.7+/-5.9 mmHg in six patients. A comparison between ventral and dorsal electrodes demonstrated significant differences (P<0.05). These changes were accompanied by analogous changes in diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, maximum dP/dt but not in the time interval between each R wave on the electrocardiogram.",Excluded

1965,"Dose-response curves and tolerance doses for late functional changes in the normal rat brain after stereotactic radiosurgery evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging: influence of end points and follow-up time. Late reaction of normal tissue is still a limiting factor in radiotherapy and radiosurgery of patients with brain tumors. Few quantitative data in terms of dose-response curves are available. In the present study, 99 animals were irradiated stereotactically at the right frontal lobe using a linear accelerator and single doses between 26 and 50 Gy. The diameter of the spherical dose distribution was 4.7 mm (80% isodose). Dose-response curves for late changes in the normal brain at 20 months were measured using T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The dependence of the dose-response curves on the follow-up time and the definition of the biological end point were determined. Tolerance doses were calculated at several effect probability levels and times after irradiation. The MRI changes were found to be dependent on dose and progressive in time. At 20 months, the tolerance doses at a 50% effect probability level were 39.6 +/- 1.0 Gy and 42.4 +/- 1.4 Gy for changes in T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. These dose-response curves can be used for further quantitative investigations on the influence of various treatment parameters, such as the application of charged particles, radiopharmaceuticals or the variation of tissue oxygenation.",Included
1936,"Salvage craniospinal irradiation for recurrent germinomas. BACKGROUND: The treatment strategies for recurrence has not been established. PURPOSE: To clarify the tumor control and complications of salvage craniospinal irradiation (CSI) for recurrent germinoma. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the medical record. Among 153 germinomas treated in Tohoku University Hospital since 1983, 22 had recurrence of germinoma. At first recurrence, 7 cases received CSI, whereas 15 cases did chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy other than craniospinal field (non- CSI). CSI was performed at 24 Gy/ 12 fractions or 30 Gy/ 25 fractions. RESULT(S): CSI had statistically significant better recurrence-free survival rate after recurrence than non-CSI (100% vs 33%, p<0.001: log-rank test). In addition, tumor control was obtained in all of four cases with the failure after non- CSI treatments for recurrence. The late complications of these 11 cases were examined. The local dose before CSI was 24- 50 Gy, and the median interval from last irradiation to CSI was 33 months. Median follow- up period after CSI was 126 months. Three patients developed newly developed visual or cognitive deficits. These patients received high-dose irradiation at initial treatment or multiple treatment before CSI. There were no late complications in the cases which had prior chemotherapy and 24 Gy of irradiation to whole ventricle only before CSI. CONCLUSION(S): Low dose CSI for the first recurrence of germinoma is effective and safe in the cases treated by chemotherapy and low dose irradiation to whole ventricle only.",Excluded
1622,"Significant tumor volume reduction of meningiomas after stereotactic radiotherapy: Results of a prospective multicenter study. OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is well established in the treatment of cranial base meningiomas. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) offers an additional treatment option. Data for radiological regression differ, ranging from 13 to 61%. Therefore, the aims of this prospective study were to quantitatively analyze tumor volume (TV) shrinkage and to calculate determining factors. METHOD(S): Eighty-four patients were examined under equal conditions before and after SRT. Fat-saturated axial T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans with 1- to 3-mm slice thickness were used. After image fusion, TV was drawn in each slice to analyze TV shrinkage three-dimensionally by the planning system. RESULT(S): Mean TV had shrunk by 33% at 24 months (P = 0.02) and by 36% at 36 months (P = 0.0007) after SRT. With regard to half-year intervals, TV reduction decreased continuously towards a steady state (P < 0.0001). Younger age (P = 0.001) and smaller TV (P = 0.01) are determining factors. There was no correlation between TV reduction, prescribed dose, histological classification, sex, or previous operations. CONCLUSION(S): Meningiomas shrink significantly after SRT. TV shrinkage declines towards a steady state, which is not yet defined. Younger age and smaller TV are determining factors. Previous operations, sex, prescribed dose, or histological subtypes do not affect TV shrinkage. Eighteen to 24 months after irradiation, when symptoms are clinically stable, is the best time for the first magnetic resonance imaging scans evaluating tumor control and shrinkage.

Six months after radiation therapy and chemotherapy for epiglottis carcinoma, he noticed paresthesia and dysesthesia in the left arm and leg. Two months after that, he complained of severe neck pain and rapidly progressing weakness in all extremities. MRI showed an enhanced intramedullary lesion with extensive edema in the cervical spinal cord. Radiation myelitis, intramedullary spinal tumor, and neurosarcoidosis were considered as differential diagnoses. Spinal cord biopsy with laminectomy was performed and radiation myelitis was diagnosed.

Bevacizumab is expected to constitute a new treatment modality for radiation necrosis. In the present cases, we observed a recurrence of radiation necrosis after temporary improvement by bevacizumab treatment. Re-treatment with bevacizumab controlled the necrosis again. A 39-year-old male and a 57-year-old female were diagnosed with glioblastoma and lung cancer metastasis, respectively. The former patient underwent partial resection of the glioblastoma, followed by boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and 30 Gy of fractionated X-ray radiotherapy. Eleven months after BNCT, he suffered from left hemiparesis and convulsions with enlargement of a perifocal edema. The latter patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery twice for the same tumor. Three months after the second radiosurgery, she had an uncontrollable convulsion and right hemiplegia with a massive perifocal edema. Both lesions were suggested to be radiation necroses by positron emission tomography using amino acids as a tracer. Neither patient responded to corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or vitamin E. They underwent treatment with 5 mg/kg bevacizumab biweekly, for a total of 6 cycles. The size of the perifocal edema was clearly reduced in response to the treatments. The neurological status of the patients improved concomitant with therapy. However, the clinical status of both patients was aggravated several months after the bevacizumab was stopped, and the perifocal edemas enlarged again. The patients underwent a second treatment with bevacizumab, and the perifocal edemas again decreased.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for acoustic neuromas, we assessed tumor control, clinical outcomes, and the risk of adverse radiation effects in patients whose tumors progressed after initial management.METHODS AND MATERIALS: During a 21-year experience at our center, 1,352 patients underwent SRS as management for their acoustic neuromas. We retrospectively identified 6 patients who underwent SRS twice for the same tumor. The median patient age was 47 years (range, 35-71 years). All patients had imaging evidence of tumor progression despite initial SRS. One patient also had incomplete surgical resection after initial SRS. All patients were deaf at the time of the second SRS. The median radiosurgery target volume at the time of the initial SRS was 0.5 cc and was 2.1 cc at the time of the second SRS. The median margin dose at the time of the initial SRS was 13 Gy and was 11 Gy at the time of the second SRS. The median interval between initial SRS and repeat SRS was 63 months (range, 25-169 months).RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 29 months after the second SRS (range, 13-71 months), tumor control or regression was achieved in all 6 patients.

1209,"Stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife radiosurgery of cystic brain metastasis. Object. Treatment options for patients with brain metastasis include tumor resection, whole-brain radiation therapy, and radiosurgery. A single treatment is not useful in cases of multiple tumors, of which at least 1 is a cystic tumor. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in the treatment of cystic brain metastasis. Methods. Between January 2001 and November 2005, 680 consecutive patients with brain metastases underwent GKS at our hospital, 30 of whom were included in this study (18 males and 12 females, mean age 60.6 +/- 11 years, range 38-75 years). Inclusion criteria were: 1) no prior whole-brain radiation therapy or resection procedure; 2) a maximum of 4 lesions on preoperative MR imaging; 3) at least 1 cystic lesion; 4) a Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 70; and 5) histological diagnosis of a malignant tumor. Results. Non-small cell lung carcinoma was the primary cancer in most patients (19 patients [63.3%]). A single metastasis was present in 13 patients (43.3%). There was a total of 81 tumors, 33 of which were cystic. Ten patients (33.3%) were in recursive partitioning analysis Class I, and 20 (66.6%) were in Class II. Before drainage the mean tumor volume was 21.8 ml (range 3.8-68 ml); before GKS the mean tumor volume was 10.1 ml (range 1.2-32 ml). The mean prescription dose to the tumor margin was 19.5 Gy (range 12-25 Gy). Overall median patient survival was 15 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 54.7% (95% confidence interval 45.3-64.1%) and 34.2% (95% confidence interval 23.1-45.3%). Local tumor control was achieved in 91.3% of the patients.

There are many important diagnostic and therapeutic aspects that must be taken into account in such situations, especially if there is an acute indication for surgery. The data is available only in the form of case reports. Method(s): The study included consecutive pregnant patients who underwent spinal surgery at five neurosurgical high-volume centers between 2010 and 2017. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical data were derived from medical records. Result(s): Overall, 23 pregnant patients were assigned to acute spinal surgery. Two of them underwent preoperative cesarian section in the 34th and 32th week. The other 21 patients underwent surgery during pregnancy. Three patients were operated upon twice or more during the same pregnancy. The median age was 33 years (min 22, max 41 years). The median gestational age was 13 completed weeks (min 7, max 34 weeks). The indications were: n = 14 lumbar herniated intervertebral discs presenting with cauda equina syndrome in 4 cases, high graded motor deficit in 7 cases, and acute pain in 3 cases; n = 4 unstable spine injuries; n = 1 intramedullary tumor with paraparesis; n = 1 paraspinal infection; n = 1 swann cell nerve root tumor presenting with higher graded paresis. Perioperative pregnancy monitoring was done with an ultrasound or ultrasound plus CTG after the 24th week of gestation in the majority of cases. All surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia (balanced anaesthesia n = 12, total intravenous anaesthesia n = 9). Median duration of surgery was 90 min (min 41, max 240). 15 patients were placed in a prone position and 6 in a right or left lateral decubitus position depending on the gestational age and the type of surgery. In 9 cases no intraoperative fluoroscopy was done, in 12 cases fluoroscopic verficiation of spine level or guidance of instrumentation placement was performed with a median fluoroscopic time of 6 s (min 1, max 24 s). No postoperative neurosurgical complications occured. Two patients underwent medical abortion due to radiation exposure before the pregnancy was diagnosed. Among the other 19 patients, 2 suffered transient gestational diabetes, and one patient presented with vaginal bleeding without any signs for fetal complications. According to our current follow-up data, no miscarriages, stillbirths or other severe obstetric complications occured during the further courses of pregnancy. All patients improved neurologically after the surgery. Conclusion(s): Spinal surgical procedures during pregnancy seem to be generally safe. Nevertheless, the indication for surgery has to be very strict and surgical procedures during pregnany should be reserved for emergency cases with acute or threatening neurological deficit. For pregnant patients the surgical strategy should be individually tailored for the mother and the fetus.",Excluded

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Permanent night-shift workers may develop shift-work disorder (SWD). In the current study, we evaluated neurophysiological and behavioral indices of distractibility across times prior to the night shift (T1), during night hours (T2), and after acute sleep deprivation (T3) in permanent hospital night workers with and without SWD.METHODS: Ten asymptomatic night workers (NW) and 18 NW with SWD participated in a 25-h sleep deprivation study. Circadian phase was evaluated by dim-light salivary melatonin onset (DLMO). Objective sleepiness was evaluated using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Electrophysiological distractibility was evaluated by brain event-related potentials (ERP), whereas behavioral distractibility was evaluated by performance on a visual task in an auditory-visual distraction paradigm.STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Comparisons of ERP results were performed by repeated-measures analysis of variance, and t-tests were used where appropriate. A Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of variables (MLST, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and DLMO) that deviated from normal.RESULTS: First, in the SWD group, the reorienting negativity ERP amplitude was significantly attenuated compared to that in the NW group. Second, the SWD group had shorter MSLT during night shift hours (4.8 +/- 4.9 min) compared to that in NW (7.8 +/- 3.7 min; U = 47; z = -2.1; P < 0.03). Third, NW with SWD had a DLMO at 20:27 +/- 5.0 h, whereas healthy NW had a DLMO at 05:00 +/- 3.4 h (U = 43.5; z = -2.22, P < 0.03). Finally, acute sleep deprivation impaired behavioral performance and the P3a ERP in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate specific deficits in neurophysiological activity in the attentional domain among the shift-work disorder group relative to night workers.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: In <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE treatments, bone marrow (BM) is one of the most important organs at risk. The authors previously developed an image-based two-compartment method for BM dosimetry, showing a significant correlation between absorbed dose to BM and hematological toxicity in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE treatments. In the present study, they aimed to further evaluate this BM dosimetry method by finding optimal settings for dividing the whole body into two compartments; in terms of minimizing the coefficient of variation (CV) for the individual absorbed doses and studying its correlation to the BM response. The authors have also added specific absorbed fractions for male and female. Finally, they compare this two-compartment method with whole-body dosimetry.METHODS: This study included 46 patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE on two to five occasions at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Planar gamma camera images were collected at four time points postinjection, and a segmentation tool using a normalized number of uptake foci (nNUF) to divide the whole body into high- and low-uptake compartments was used. The authors characterized the two-compartment model and compared it with whole-body dosimetry.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The dosimetry method was robust, with an optimal nNUF value of 0.1-0.2. Using an nNUF value of 0.15, the absorbed BM dose was estimated as 0.20 Gy/7.4 GBq, and the CV as 8.4%. Compared to whole-body dosimetry, stronger correlation was found between absorbed dose to BM and hematological response using the two-compartment method.

1589,"Quantifying the impact of antiangiogenic therapy on hypoxia and implications for radiation therapy in glioblastoma multiforme with a biomathematical model. Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor. As angiogenesis is a major hallmark of GBM, it can be inferred that hypoxia plays a prominent role in the progression of the disease. However, due to difficulty in assessing hypoxia, the development and evolution of hypoxia has not been well studied for GBM. 18F-Fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET indirectly measures hypoxia. It is known that hypoxia reduces the efficacy of radiation therapy, and one current strategy being explored is to combine anti-angiogenic therapy and radiation therapy. However, it is unclear whether anti-angiogenic therapy is ultimately reducing or increasing hypoxia nor is it clear how long the effects last. Method(s): We have developed a spatio-temporal biomathematical model for glioma proliferation and invasion that incorporates the angiogenic cascade. In this context, we can simulate the action of anti-angiogenic treatment, such as bevacizumab, by modifying the availability of angiogenic factors. By applying a pharmacokinetic model for the uptake of FMISO to the simulation results, we can generate the corresponding FMISO-PET images during and after anti-angiogenic therapy to compare with what would be seen in the clinic. Result(s): Simulation results for a wide range of tumor kinetics demonstrated that hypoxia in general decreased during anti-angiogenic therapy. However, the rates at which it decreased and the time for the hypoxia to return to pre-treatment levels were not uniform. Conclusion(s): Dynamic understanding of anti-angiogenic therapy effects on vascular normalization and hypoxia suggest that optimal timing of radiation therapy and anti-angiogenic therapies would vary by patient. This biomathematical model can be tuned to individual patients' tumors and provide similar information as a FMISO-PET image and also give insight into the dynamics of the hypoxia over time. Such insight could be invaluable to patient-specific treatment planning for combining radiation with antiangiogenics.",Excluded

Background: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a targeted type of radiotherapy that has a number of significant advantages over conventional external beam photon irradiation, especially in that radiation can be selectively delivered to tumor cells. We had, first in the world, treated with BNCT for a patient with recurrent head and neck Cancers (HNC) in 2001. Method(s): From December, 2001 to February, 2013, we have treated a total of 35 patients with recurrent HNC by means of 52 applications of BNCT. Histopathologically, there were 24 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 7 with salivary gland carcinomas and 4 with sarcomas. All of them had received standard therapy and subsequently developed recurrent disease for which there were no other treatment options. All of the patients received intravenously either a combination of two boron containing drugs, sodium borocaptate (BSH, 5g) and boronophenylalanine (BPA, 250mg/kg) or BPA (500mg/kg) alone. In this report we will summarize the clinical results and outcomes of 35 patients with HNC who had received BNCT at either the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURI) or the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) nuclear reactor. Result(s): All of the patients had advanced disease and 17 of 35 (49%) had regional lymph node metastases and 10 out of 35 (29%) had distant metastases at the time of treatment.

This human exposure study examined the relationship between field strength and biological response and tested whether the exposure levels at which the greatest effects occur differ for different endpoints. Three matched groups of 18 men each participated in two 6 h exposure test sessions. All subjects were sham exposed in one session. In the other session, each group of subjects was exposed at a different level of combined electric and magnetic field strength (low group:6 kV/m, 10 microT; medium group:9 kV/m, 20 microT; and high group: 12 kV/m, 30 microT). The study was performed double blind, with exposure order counterbalanced. Significant slowing of heart rate, as well as alternations in the latency and amplitude of event-related brain potential measures derived from the electro encephalogram (EEG), occurred in the group exposed to the 9 kV/m, 20 microT combined field (medium group). Exposure at the other field strength levels had no influence on cardiac measures and differential effects on EEG activity. Significant decrements in reaction time and in performance accuracy on a time estimation task were observed only in the low group. These results provide support for the hypothesis that humans may be more responsive to some combinations or levels of field strength than to others and that such differences in responsivity may depend, in part, on the endpoint of interest.",Excluded

1726,"Variation of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer birefringence in normal human subjects. PURPOSE: The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) exhibits linear birefringence due to the oriented cylindrical structure of ganglion cell axons. The birefringence (Deltan) depends on the density and composition of axonal organelles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distribution of birefringence around the optic nerve head (ONH) in normal subjects.METHODS: Birefringence was calculated along circular scan paths around the ONH as Deltan = R/T, where R is RNFL retardance measured by scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) and T is RNFL thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT scans on a 3.4 mm diameter circle were obtained from 26 normal subjects aged 18 to 53 years. Scans on circles with various diameters were obtained from 17 of these subjects.RESULTS: The average reproducibility of Deltan measured on three separate days in four subjects was +/- 0.05 nm/microm. In most subjects Deltan varied significantly along a circular path around the ONH, with maxima in superior and inferior bundles, minima temporally and nasally, and a mean of 0.32 +/- 0.03 nm/microm. Deltan profiles on circles of different diameter were similar, suggesting that Deltan did not vary along nerve fiber bundles.CONCLUSIONS: RNFL birefringence varies with position around the ONH. This variation may result from known structural differences among nerve fiber bundles that serve different retinal regions. Constant Deltan along bundles is consistent with this hypothesis. Measurements of RNFL birefringence may provide a means to detect early subcellular changes in glaucoma.",Excluded
1270,"Complications of gamma knife neurosurgery and their appropriate management. There are four main risks with Gamma Knife neurosurgery. Firstly, there are direct complications that would not have arisen if the patient had not undergone the specific treatment under consideration. For radiosurgery, the direct complications are radiation-induced damage to the tissues, which may be temporary or permanent. They may be expressed clinically or be clinically silent. In addition, there are complications that are specific to certain diseases and their locations, such as pituitary failure following treatment of pituitary adenomas and deafness, facial palsy, or trigeminal deficit following the treatment of vestibular schwannomas. Second, there are indirect or management-related complications arising from delayed control of the disease process, such as a re-bleed after treatment of a vascular lesion before its occlusion. Third, there is the risk of induction of neoplasia from irradiation of normal tissue or tumor. These are separate processes. An example of the first would be induction of a glioma after treatment of a vascular malformation. An example of the second would be induction of malignant change in a benign vestibular schwannoma. Finally, there is treatment failure, where tumors continue to grow after treatment or vascular malformations fail to occlude.",Excluded

In order to study whether there exist a period of activity in the human early visual cortex that contributes exclusively to visual awareness, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the early visual cortex and measured subjective visual awareness during visual forced-choice symbol or orientation discrimination tasks. TMS produced one dip in awareness 60-120 ms after stimulus onset, while forced-choice orientation discrimination was suppressed between 60 and 90 ms and symbol discrimination between 60 and 120 ms. Thus, a time window specific to visual awareness was found only in the orientation condition at 120 ms. The results imply that both conscious and unconscious perception depend on activity in early visual areas. On the basis of previous estimates of neural processing speed, we suggest that the late part of the activity period most likely involve local extrastriate-striate interactions which provide the contents for visual awareness but are not themselves sufficient for awareness to arise.",Excluded
2372,"Radionecrosis after stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases. INTRODUCTION: Radionecrosis (RN) represents the main complication of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for brain metastases. It may be observed in up to 34% of cases at 24 months after treatment and associated with significant morbidity in 10-17%.AREAS COVERED: Our aim is to discuss the results of original studies on RN related to SRT for brain metastases. Expert commentary: Although the development of RN is unpredictable, larger volume of the lesion, prior whole brain irradiation, and higher dose of radiation represent the major risk factors. RN appears on MRI as contrast-enhancing necrotic lesions, surrounded by edema, occurring at least 3 months after SRT, localized within fields of irradiation. No firm criteria are established. Surgery can provide symptomatic relief but is associated with a risk of complications. Corticosteroids are considered the standard of care treatment, despite limited efficacy and many adverse effects. Bevacizumab represents another interesting option that needs to be validated.",Excluded

Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1) was used to probe the expression of enhanced reactivation (ER) in cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT). The survival of UV-irradiated HSV-1 was increased as a result of UV- or X-preirradiation of both AT and normal cells. This result contrasts with our previous observation showing that contrary to normal cells AT cells are deficient for ER of a single-stranded DNA parvovirus. A difference between the molecular processes underlying ER of single- and double-stranded DNA viruses might explain these results.,Excluded
1937,"Terrestrial isopods congregate under a low-level beta-emitter source. Ionizing radiation is ubiquitous, but very few experiments have investigated the biological effects of the natural background radiation at very low doses (>10 mGy/yr). We examined whether the background radiation, or radiation of a slightly higher level, has a role in evoking changes in behaviors of terrestrial isopods (woodlice). Upon exposure to a source giving 15 times the background level placed at one end of a box, a significant increase in the number of woodlice gathering under the beta-source was observed with time, as compared with the sham control. Terrestrial isopods have chemoreceptors (the olfactory system) on the terminal segment of their antennae. An additional experiment confirmed the involvement of these antennae in the radiation effect on behavior. After the excision of the antennae, no beta-taxis response was observed. The behavior of the group exposed to the source giving 30 times the background tended to decrease gradually in the area of the source, and the individuals aggregated in the area away from the source. Thus, the olfactory sensor in the antennae may be an important organ involved in the prompt response to radiation exposure, and the discrimination of the radiation field strengths of radioisotopes.",Included
2472,"Hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown. The vascular endothelial cell is believed to be a major target cell of radiation-induced injury to the central nervous system. Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier is associated with radiation-induced white matter lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. Adult rats were irradiated with graded single doses of 0-22 Gy to the cervical spinal cord. At various times up to 28 weeks after radiation, blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability was assessed using immunohistochemistry with antialbumin antibody and gamma counting of (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Hypoxia was assessed using two 2-nitroimidazole markers, [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise and 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-l-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3,-pentafluoropropyl) acetamide (EF5), with binding in the rat spinal cord measured using gamma counting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In the nonirradiated rat spinal cord, there was no evidence of BSCB disruption or VEGF expression. After 16-22 Gy, there was a dose-dependent increase in albumin staining and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid activity beginning at 16 weeks, consistent with barrier breakdown. A similar dose-dependent increase in white matter astrocytes that showed immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization signals for VEGF was observed. No increase in VEGF-positive cells was observed in gray matter. By 20 weeks after 20-22 Gy, animals developed white matter necrosis associated with diffuse albumin staining. Irradiated rat spinal cord showed a dose (16-22 Gy)- and time-dependent (16-20 weeks after 22 Gy) increase in [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise accumulation compared to nonirradiated controls. A similar pattern of dose- and time-dependent EF5 immunoreactivity was also observed in white matter. Areas of EF5 expression and VEGF in situ signals colocalized with areas of albumin immunoreactivity. It is concluded that there is a dose-dependent temporal and spatial association of hypoxia, VEGF up-regulation, and radiation-induced BSCB dysfunction. Hypoxia may provide the signal for VEGF up-regulation and perpetuate endothelial permeability damage in the central nervous system after ionizing radiation.",Included

Plasmodium gallinaceum-infected blood which received up to 24 krad during exposure to gamma-rays from a cobalt-60 source produced infections of normal course and duration when injected into chickens. The prepatent period advanced with increasing exposure of infected blood to radiation, suggesting some degree of attenuation. At 26, 28 and 30 krad, the infections were transient and the parasites were morphologically abnormal. It is thought that the amount of radiation required to render the parasites non-viable is about 45 krad for an inoculum of 10(6) parasites. There is evidence that exoerythrocytic stages may be more susceptible to gamma-rays than are blood parasites. Chickens were inoculated three times, over a period of four weeks, with vaccines prepared from gamma-irradiated infected blood and brain tissue. Half the birds which had been inoculated with attenuated parasitized blood exhibited mild infections during vaccination, and they were the only birds to show at challenge immunity to both homologous blood and exoerythrocytic parasites.",Included

In this study, we investigated the adhesion and neurite outgrowth of nerve cells on a fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation. We used fluorinated polyimide because of its biocompatibility and excellent thermal and mechanical properties for ion irradiation. Rattus norvegicus chromaffin (PC12) cells were used for in vitro studies. The polyimide films were irradiated with He(+), Ne(+), or Kr(+) ions in a fluence range from 10(13) to 10(15) ions/cm(2) at 50 keV. PC12 cells selectively adhered to the polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation. The total neurite length for PC12 cells grown on the Kr(+)-irradiated film was the longest; the neurite length on the film irradiated by Kr(+) after 9 days was approximately five times longer than that for cells grown on the He(+)-irradiated film, i.e., 135 micro m. In addition, the PC12 differentiation rate on the ion-irradiated polyimide films also showed a similar trend to the total neurite length for PC12 cells cultured on the films: the rate decreased in the order Kr(+) > Ne(+) > He(+). This initial study indicated enhanced neurite outgrowth and differentiation of PC12 cells on fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation.",Excluded

1837,"Interlayer Repulsion of Retinal Ganglion Cell Mosaics Regulates Spatial Organization of Functional Maps in the Visual Cortex. In higher mammals, orientation tuning of neurons is organized into a quasi-periodic pattern in the primary visual cortex. Our previous model studies suggested that the topography of cortical orientation maps may originate from moire interference of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics, but did not account for how the consistent spatial period of maps could be achieved. Here we address this issue with two crucial findings on the development of RGC mosaics: first, homotypic local repulsion between RGCs can develop a long-range hexagonal periodicity. Second, heterotypic interaction restrains the alignment of ON and OFF mosaics, and generates a periodic interference pattern map with consistent spatial frequency. To validate our model, we quantitatively analyzed the RGC mosaics in cat data, and confirmed that the observed retinal mosaics showed evidence of heterotypic interactions, contrary to the previous view that ON and OFF mosaics are developed independently. <b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Orientation map is one of the most studied functional maps in the brain, but it has remained unanswered how the consistent spatial periodicity of maps could be developed. In the current study, we address this issue with our developmental model for the retinal origin of orientation map. We showed that local repulsive interactions between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can develop a hexagonal periodicity in the RGC mosaics and restrict the alignment between ON and OFF mosaics, so that they generate a periodic pattern with consistent spatial frequency for both the RGC mosaics and the cortical orientation maps. Our results demonstrate that the organization of functional maps in visual cortex, including its structural consistency, may be constrained by a retinal blueprint.",Excluded

Models are made of homogeneous native and coagulated gray, thalamus, and white matter as well as blood. Dual layer models, including models with a layer of cerebrospinal fluid between the fibers and the brain tissue, are also made. Simulated I780 was 0.16 for gray matter, 0.67 for coagulate gray matter, 0.36 for thalamus, 0.39 for coagulated thalamus, unity for white matter, 0.70 for coagulated white matter, and 0.24 for blood. Thalamic matter is also found to reflect more light than gray matter and less than white matter in clinical studies. In conclusion, the reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between gray and white matter during navigation. Furthermore, coagulation of light gray tissue, such as the thalamus, might be difficult to detect using I780, but coagulation in darker gray tissue should result in a rapid increase of I780.",Excluded

We have previously shown that exposure of the rat fetus to ionizing radiation produces dose-dependent (0.25-1.25 Gy) changes in postnatal growth and behavior, and decreases in cerebral cortex thickness. Pregnant rats were exposed to single doses of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy, or to two doses of 0.5 Gy (separated by a 3 h interval) on gestational day 15. Pups were weighed and subjected to behavioral tests (righting reflex; reflex suspension; negative geotaxis; continuous corridor; and length, width, and sine of gait) over postnatal days 7-28. The rats were then sacrificed and brains removed for histology. The fractionated doses produced responses that were generally intermediate between those produced by the single doses and which, by interpolation, could be expressed as equivalent to a single dose between 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. Overall, exposure of the fetal rat to two doses of 0.5 Gy separated by 3 h produced effects equivalent to a single dose of 0.85 Gy. We conclude that fractionation of radiation dose results in less damage to the developing rat cerebral cortex, as measured by postnatal growth, behavioral tests, and morphological assessment.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between calculated doses to the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) and the penile bulb (PB) and the development of erectile dysfunction (ED) after low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (LDRPB) alone.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1997 and June 1999, 84 men were treated with LDRPB alone. Inclusion criteria for this study were (1) no ED according to a self-administered questionnaire before PB, (2) treatment with PB alone (125I; 144 Gy), (3) postimplant CT scan of the prostate 1 month after PB, and (4) minimum of 24 months of continuous follow-up. Fifty men met all inclusion criteria. ED was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire completed before and at each follow-up visit after LDRPB. Radiation doses to the NVB and PB were calculated on the basis of axial postimplant CT images. Multiple variables (patient-related and dosimetric quantifiers) that may predict for the development of ED were examined by univariate analysis.RESULTS: Thirty of the 50 men (60%) were potent at last follow-up. The only patient-related variable that predicted for the development of ED was patient age (<65 vs. >65 years; p=0.03). The calculated mean maximum doses to the NVB and PB were 684 Gy (range, 195-1277 Gy) and 498 Gy (range, 44-971 Gy), respectively. The mean calculated doses to 50% of the NVB and PB were 158 Gy (range, 76-240 Gy) and 43 Gy (range, 19-101 Gy), respectively. The calculated mean maximum, mean minimum, and mean doses to 50% of the NVB or PB did not differ between those men who developed ED and those men who did not develop ED. None of the dosimetric variables examined predicted the development of ED after LDRPB.CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, higher calculated doses to the NVB or PB are not associated with ED after LDRPB.",Excluded

Background: Mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) occurs in > 70% of WHO grades II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas and secondary glioblastoma (GBM). The mutant enzyme catalyze the reduction of a-ketoglutaric acid to D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid, leading to cancer initiation. In this study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of SYC-435 (1-hydroxypyridin-2-one), a newly developed mutant IDH1inhibitor, both in vitro and in vivo in IDH1 mutant gliomas as compared with IDH1 wild type GBMs. Method(s): An established neurosphere line (BT142) of anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA), and a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of recurrent AOA (ICV0914AOA), and 2 PDOX models of GBM (IC-4687GBM and IC-3752GBM) were included. IDH1 mutations (R132H and R132C) were analyzed by pyrosequencing. To determine the in vitro antitumor activities, tumor cells were exposed to SYC-435 (0.02 to 20 [iM) and examining for changes of cell proliferation every 3-4 days till day 13 by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. For in vivo effects, orthotopic xenograft mouse models of IC-BT142AOA and IC-V0914AOA were treated with vehicle (as control), SYC-435 (i.p., 15 mg/kg/day x 28 days), temozolomide (TMZ, oral, 50 mg/kg/day x 5 days) + fractionated radiation (XRT, 2 Gy/day x 5 days) (as standard therapy), and combination of SYC-435 with standard therapy starting 2 weeks after intracranial tumor implantation. Animal survival times were analyzed by log rank analysis. Result(s): IDH1 R132H mutation (homozygous) was detected in BT142AOA neurosphere line and R132C mutation (mutant allele frequency 39-42%) in IC-V0914AOA xenograft cells, while the two GBM models (IC-4687GBM and IC-3752GBM) carried wild-type IDH1. Suppression of cell growth was observed in time- and dosedependent manner by SYC-435, particularly at the IDH1 mutant models. At 0.5 ^M, SYC-435 inhibited cell growth by 90% in BT142 and 60% in IC-V0914AOA cells, whereas in IDH wild-type GBMs only by 17% in IC-4687GBM and 19% in IC-3752GBM cells at day 13, indicating the high selectivity of SYC-435 of mutant over wild type IDH1. Systematic in vivo treatment with SYC-435 alone did not alter survival times in neither IC-BT142AOA nor IC-V0914AOA models when compared with the control group. Although standard therapy significantly prolonged animal survival times in both models (P<0.0005), combining SYC-435 with standard therapies further extended the median survival times from 106 days (in the standard therapy group) to 124 days (P<0.05) in IC-V0914AOA and exhibited similar trend in IC-BT142AOA.

OBJECT: Linear accelerator (LINAC)-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment option for patients with melanoma in whom brain metastases have developed. Very limited data are available on treating patients with >=5 lesions. The authors sought to determine the effectiveness of SRS in patients with >=5 melanoma brain metastases.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of metastatic melanoma treated with SRS in a single treatment session for >=5 lesions was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were reviewed post-SRS to evaluate local control (LC). Disease progression on imaging was defined using the 2009 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Survival curves were calculated from the date of brain metastases diagnosis or the date of SRS by using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Univariate and multivariate analysis (UVA and MVA, respectively) were performed using the Cox proportional-hazards model.RESULTS: The authors identified 149 metastatic brain lesions treated in 28 patients. The median patient age was 60.5 years (range 38-83 years), and the majority of patients (24 [85.7%]) had extracranial metastases. Four patients (14.3%) had received previous whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and 11 (39.3%) had undergone previous SRS. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 0.34 cm3 (range 0.01-12.5 cm3). Median follow-up was 6.3 months (range 1-46 months). At the time of treatment, 7% of patients were categorized as recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class I, 89% as RPA Class II, and 4% as RPA Class III. The rate of local failure was 11.4%. Kaplan-Meier LC estimates at 6 and 12 months were 91.3% and 82.2%, respectively. A PTV volume>=0.34 cm3 was a significant predictor of local failure on UVA (HR 16.1, 95% CI 3.2-292.6, p<0.0001) and MVA (HR 14.8, 95% CI 3.0-268.5, p=0.0002). Sixteen patients (57.1%) were noted to have distant failure in the brain with a median time to failure of 3 months (range 1-15 months). Nine patients with distant failures received WBRT, and 7 received additional SRS. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.4 and 7.6 months from the date of brain metastases diagnosis and the date of SRS, respectively. The KM OS estimates at 6 and 12 months were 57.8% and 28.2%, respectively, from the time of SRS treatment. The RPA class was a significant predictor of KM OS estimates from the date of treatment (p=0.02). Patients who did not receive WBRT after SRS treatment had decreased OS on MVA (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-12.0, p=0.03), and patients who did not receive WBRT prior to SRS had improved OS (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.53, p=0.007).CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery for >=5 lesions appears to be effective for selected patients with metastatic melanoma, offering excellent LC. This is particularly important for patients as new targeted systemic agents are improving outcomes but still have limited efficacy within the central nervous system.",Excluded

Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries is a diatom species associated with the production of domoic acid (DA), a water soluble neurotoxin that is easily transferred up in the food web, causing devastating effects on top marine organisms and humans. Despite studies on Pseudo-nitzschia are relevant to human health safety, partitioning of marine toxins between intracellular and extracellular fractions are poorly documented. This study aimed to determine the growth rates and DA content, both intracellular and extracellular, of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cultures at three different light settings (15, 120 and 560mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The optimal conditions for cell growth were observed at 120 and 560mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, whereas DA production was observed in P. multiseries at 15 and 120mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, ranging between 0.18-2.56 and 0.16-3.5pg DA cell<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Higher intracellular DA concentrations were found during the senescence phase at low light intensity and during the exponential phase at medium light intensity, while higher concentrations of dissolved DA were found at low and medium light intensities in the senescence phase reaching 3 and 10ng DA mL<sup>-1</sup> respectively. The amount of toxin released into the culture medium represents the most important fraction ranging between 63 and 98% during the exponential phase and nearly 99% during the senescence phase. In contrast, under low light intensity, dissolved DA was detected in the culture medium only during the senescence phase. This study confirms the importance of light intensity on DA production and clearly shows that dissolved domoic acid is an important fraction in Pseudo-nitzschia cultures, suggesting with the careful assumptions of results from static cultures extrapolated to bloom situations that waterborne exposure of marine organism should be considered during blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries.",Excluded

Modifications are described for an innovative and widely used high-performance liquid chromatography technique that resolves a very broad spectrum of lipids for quantitation by evaporative light-scattering detection. Substitution of acetone for 2-propanol in a portion of the solvent gradient program yields consistent resolution of diacylglycerol and cholesterol without sacrificing baseline resolution of the remaining major lipid classes. Moreover, previously noted instabilities in triacylglycerol retention time are eliminated. The introduction of acetone also enables a 20% reduction in flow-rate without an increase in total run time. As a further modification of the mobile phase composition, acetic acid and ethanolamine are substituted for the serine-ethylamine combination that was originally shown to improve column performance. The combination of acetic acid and ethanolamine yields the same result but the increased volatility of these solutes over serine results in decreased baseline noise.

Antisera specificity is confirmed by them recognising a approximately 350 kDa polypeptide in wild-type cells but not in A-T cells containing mutations that truncate ATM upstream of the antibody binding sites. We show that ATM is almost exclusively nuclear and is expressed in all cell lines and tissues analysed. However, ATM levels are not regulated in response to u.v. or ionising radiation. These data are consistent with ATM being a component of the DNA damage detection apparatus rather than being an inducible downstream effector of the DNA damage response. In addition, we analyse ATM protein expression in a variety of A-T patients. Strikingly, ATM expression is reduced drastically or absent in all patients analysed, including those predicted to express proteins that should be detected by our antisera. Thus, the A-T phenotype may result not only from mutations that disrupt functional domains of ATM, but also from mutations that destabilise the ATM mRNA or protein. Finally, we report that a group of patients displaying an intermediate A-T phenotype express low levels of apparently full-length ATM. This suggests that the ATM pathway is partially active in these individuals and that there is a correlation between levels of residual ATM expression and disease severity.",Excluded
2099,"[Infiltrative peripheral neuropathy of acute monoblastic leukemia during hematologic remission]. A 38-year-old woman with acute monoblastic leukemia developed severe continuous pain in the left arm while she was in hematologic remission following both systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy. A nerve conduction study (NCS) showed marked decrease of amplitude in the left ulnar nerve, consistent with infiltration of leukemic cells. The pain in the arm was reduced by irradiation to the left brachial plexus, but right facial nerve palsy occurred. No improvement was achieved by systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy plus irradiation to the whole brain and right parotid. After sometime, she complained of pains in the legs and right foot drop. NCS showed amplitude decrease in bilateral peroneal nerve. Throughout the course, bone marrow remained in complete remission, and no signs of meningeal leukemia were obtained. A treatment with high dose Ara-C appeared to be effective for the pain in the legs. The foot drop, however, persisted and peripheral neuropathy progressed even after high dose Ara-C therapy. Peripheral nerve involvement in acute leukemia appears to be rare, and even more so in case of hematologic remission. The blood-nerve barrier may allow some malignant cells to escape from cytotoxic agents. Therefore, irradiation or high dose Ara-C therapy would seem to be rational approaches to the problem.",Excluded
1462,"Differential radiosensitivity of neurons and neuroglia of the hippocampus in the adult rabbit. Adult rabbits were subjected to 4.5 Gy of whole-blody or brain alone gamma-irradiation, and their hippocampus was examined with the light and electron microscope. Pycnotic cells were found at the base of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in the so-called subgranular zone, as soon as 3 h after irradiation, and were cleared up by active phagocytosis after 48 h. Some of these cells appeared as undifferentiated, whereas others were differentiating granule cells, and possibly immature neuroglia. The extent of cell necrosis was contingent upon the age of the animal, the oldest animal studied (27 months) showing only sparse lesion of that type. Astrocytes and microglia were responsible for the phagocytosis of dead cells. Another type of lesion was found in the nuclei of the mature granule cells and consisted of light spots which appeared 1 h after the irradiation and disappeared almost completely after 48 h. Pyramidal cells did not show any of these two lesions. It is concluded that the laterations in the electrical activity of pyrimidal cells, following irradiation, are at least partly due to lesions affecting the dentate gyrus. Radionecrosis in the subgranular zone is related to the presence of immature cells in this region.",Included

PURPOSE: The association between early radiological lung reactions consequent upon radiotherapy and patients' symptoms is not well established. This prospective study examined the association between symptoms experienced by the patient, clinical findings observed by the physician and reactions visible in chest X-ray as interpreted by a radiologist, as well as the association between skin or breast symptoms and lung symptoms induced by radiotherapy after different methods of surgery.METHODS: Altogether 207 consecutive breast cancer patients entered the trial between 1st October 1997 and 31st December 1998. Chest X-rays were taken at entry and 3, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. The frequency and intensity of symptoms as well as clinical and chest X-ray findings were assessed over time.RESULTS: Skin and breast symptoms were common after radiotherapy but seldom severe (9%). Lung reactions were seen in chest X-ray in 47% of patients in re-evaluation by a radiologist at 3 months. The frequency of lung or skin symptoms did not correlate with chest X-ray findings, but there was a significant correlation between skin and lung symptoms. Radiotherapy after conservative surgery for node-positive breast cancer caused lung reactions seen in chest X-ray more often than after mastectomy when using other techniques. The reactions were most common at the 6 month evaluation (P=0.01). Concomitant adjuvant chemo- or endocrine therapy did not significantly increase the incidence of lung reactions.CONCLUSIONS: Skin, breast and lung symptoms were frequent after radiotherapy, but there was no real association between lung or skin symptoms and chest X-ray findings. The only correlation noted was between skin or breast symptoms and lung symptoms experienced by patients. Radiotherapy after conservative surgery was more frequently linked to chest X-ray findings than radiotherapy after mastectomy. We conclude that routine chest X-ray after radiotherapy gives no more clinically relevant information than the symptoms of the patient and we do not recommend routine chest X-rays for that reason.",Excluded
1640,"Effectiveness of a 1-day aspiration plus Gamma Knife surgery procedure for metastatic brain tumor with a cystic component. OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has gained increasing relevance in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors, but many metastatic tumors contain a large cystic component and often exceed the size limit for GKS. For such lesions, the authors adopted a procedure in which stereotactic aspiration is first performed and followed immediately by GKS on the same day. In this paper, the authors describe this 1-day combined procedure and evaluate its efficacy.METHODS: Between 2005 and 2010, 25 cystic metastases in 25 patients were treated at Dokkyo Medical University. The patients first underwent MRI and stereotactic aspiration of the cyst while stationary in a Leksell stereotactic frame; immediately afterward, the patients underwent a second MR imaging session and Gamma Knife treatment. Tumor volume reduction, tumor control rate, and overall survival were examined.RESULTS: Tumor volume, including the cystic component, decreased from 8.0-64.2 cm(3) (mean 20.3 cm(3)) to 3.0-36.2 cm(3) (mean 10.3 cm(3)) following aspiration, and the volume of 24 of 25 lesions decreased to less than 16.6 cm(3), which is equivalent to the volume of a 3.16-cm sphere. At least 20 Gy was delivered to the entire lesion in 24 of 25 cases. Good tumor control was obtained in 16 of 21 cases that could be evaluated during a median follow-up period of 11 months (range 1-27 months); however, reaccumulation of cyst contents was observed in 2 patients who required Ommaya reservoir placement.CONCLUSIONS: The 1-day aspiration plus GKS procedure is an effective and time-efficient treatment for large cystic brain metastases.",Excluded

1251,"Circadian clock protein BMAL1 regulates melanogenesis through MITF. The circadian clock is near ubiquitous, self-sustaining, and oscillates with a periodic cycle of about 24 hr. The skin circadian clock is known to be involved in various important cellular pathways including cell cycle, nucleotide excision repair, and metabolism by regulating the expression of specific target genes known as the clock-controlled genes (CCGs). In this study, we show that Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), an essential rate-limiting protein in melanin biosynthesis, is a transcriptional target of the circadian clock. Using primary human melanocytes, human melanoma cells and mouse skin tissues, we have established transcriptional regulation of MITF by the circadian clock, which translates into rhythmic 24 hr expression of MITF mRNA and protein levels. We also show that the circadian clock protein Brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (BMAL1) is a positive regulator of MITF, which causes an increase in melanin levels. Further, we demonstrate that upon exposure to solar UV-B radiation in presence of BMAL1, there is reduced gammaH2AX and cleaved PARP level compared to BMAL1 deficient group, which contributes to enhanced cell viability and survival. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the novel regulation of MITF by BMAL1 provides better protection against solar UV-B mediated genomic instability and melanomagenesis.",Excluded

We performed the simultaneous measurement of intrinsic optical signals (IOSs) related to metabolic activity and cellular and subcellular morphological characteristics, i.e., light scattering for a rat global ischemic brain model made by rapidly removing blood by saline infusion. The signals were measured on the basis of multiwavelength diffuse reflectances in which 605 and 830 nm were used to detect the IOSs that are thought to be dominantly affected by redox changes of heme aa(3) and CuA in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), respectively. For measuring the scattering signal, the wavelength that was found to be most insensitive to the absorption changes, e.g., approximately 620 nm, was used. The measurements suggested that an increase in the absorption due to reduction of heme aa(3) occurred soon after blood clearance, and this was followed by a large triphasic change in light scattering, during which time a decrease in the absorption due to reduction of CuA occurred. Through the triphasic scattering change, scattering signals increased by 5.2 +/- 1.5% (n = 5), and the increase in light scattering showed significant correlation with both the reflectance intensity changes at 605 and 830 nm. This suggests that morphological changes in cells correlate with reductions of heme aa(3) and CuA. Histological analysis of tissue after the triphasic scattering change showed no alteration in either the nuclei or the cytoskeleton, but electron microscopic observation revealed deformed, enlarged mitochondria and expanded dendrites. These findings suggest that the simultaneous measurement of absorption signals related to the redox changes in the CcO and the scattering signal is useful for monitoring tissue viability in the brain.",Excluded

Also antiproliferative effects have been reported against glioblastoma cell lines. DESIGN/METHODS: LAZ PEGylated liposomes (Lipo G) were developed at the University of Houston.. Glioblastoma cell line U87-expressing firefly luciferase reporter gene (100,000 cells in 2 mL) was injected intracranially in each SCID mouse. There were 4 treatment groups (n = 8-9, each): brain model (M) without treatment (control), radiation 2Gy weekly (M + R), LipoGat 5 mug/kg dose intraperitoneally twice per week (M + L) and radiation with LipoG(M + R + L). Treatment lasted three weeks. Tumor size was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), in each mouse. Mice were sacrificed after 3 weeks. Brain was harvested. Lipid peroxidation of brain tissues was quantified by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) as a surrogate biomarker. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan Meier analysis at P= 0.05. RESULT(S): BLI intensity was 4002.03+/-1737.67, 2034+/-737.72, 1387.36+/-684.53 and 2498.89+/-2521.32 % for M, M + R, M+ L and M + R + L, respectively. Tumor size of the M+ L group was reduced by 65% compared to control. There was no significant difference in tumor size of radiated groups compared to control group.MDAbrain concentration inM+ L andM+ R + L groups was significantly less than in M+ R group (8.27+/-0.78 and 10.37+/- 3.30 muM/gm vs. 23.09+/- 3.79 muM/gm). The survival mean was 22.67, 25.33, 25.22 and 27.13 days for M, M+ R, M + R + L and M + L groups, respectively. Mean survival of LAZ treated groups (M + L and M + R + L) was significantly longer than that of the control group. CONCLUSION(S): LAZ liposomal formulations reduced tumor growth by 65%.

1355,"MDM2 overexpression is associated with short survival in adults with medulloblastoma. In adult medulloblastoma, postoperative radiotherapy is significantly effective in prolonging time to recurrence and survival time; however, the response of individual cases to radiotherapy, that is the total survival, is different. Apoptosis is an important cellular response to radiation. It can be hypothesized that the individual radiosensitivity of medulloblastomas depends on the individual capability to undergo apoptosis. p53 protein is involved in the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation; loss of function of p53 can be the consequence not only of TP53 mutations, but also of amplification and/or overexpression of the MDM2 gene. We have analyzed cerebellar medulloblastomas from 51 adults (>16 years of age) for MDM2 gene amplification (by differential polymerase chain reaction assay), TP53 gene mutation (by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-8), and immunohistochemical expression of p53 (clone DO1) and MDM2 (clone IF2). The results have been evaluated in relation to age, tumor location, classic or desmoplastic type, MIB-1 labeling index, and total survival. No tumor had MDM2 amplification. Ten tumors had MDM2 positive tumor cells. One case had a mutated TP53 gene; 16/51 cases had intense p53 immunostaining. Only 2 MDM2 protein-positive tumors were also p53-positive. Both subgroups of MDM2 - and p53-positive tumors had a significantly shorter postoperative survival. In conclusion, the overexpression of MDM2 protein and the accumulation of wild-type p53 are unrelated in adult medulloblastoma; they may result in a reduced apoptotic response after radiotherapy and contribute to a shortened survival. Also, MDM2 amplification and TP53 gene mutation are rare events in medulloblastomas of adults.",Excluded
1705,"Interference between active implanted medical devices and electromagnetic field emitting devices is rare but real: Results of an incidence study in a population of physicians in France. Background and Objective Assessing the behavior of active implanted medical devices (AIMDs) in response to electromagnetic field (EMF) transmitters is a current issue of great importance. Given the numerous telecommunication systems and our lack of knowledge as to the impact of electromagnetic effects, this study investigated the reality of possible AIMD disturbance by EMFs by interviewing health professionals. Method A self-administered postal questionnaire was sent to almost 5,000 physicians in five specialties: cardiology; endocrinology; ears, nose, and throat; urology; and neurology. It collected data on the existence and annual number of incidents observed and the conditions under which they occurred, the EMF sources involved, and the means of managing the malfunctions. Results A total of 1,188 physicians agreed to participate. Sixteen percent of participants reported cases of implant failure, three-quarters of whom, mainly in cardiology, reported rates of at least one incident per year - amounting to more than 100 incidents per year in all. Severity appeared to be moderate (discomfort or transient symptoms), but frequently required resetting or, more rarely, replacing the device. Some serious incidents were, however, reported. The sources implicated were basically of two types: electronic security systems (antitheft and airport gates) and medical electromagnetic radiation devices. These incidents were poorly reported within the public health system, preventing follow-up and effective performance of alert and surveillance functions. Conclusion Although minor, the risk of interference between EMF sources and AIMDs is real and calls for vigilance. It particularly concerns antitheft and airport security gates, though other sources may also cause incidents. ©2013, The Authors. Journal compilation ©2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1925,"Severed corticospinal axons recover electrophysiologic control of muscle activity after x-ray therapy in lesioned adult spinal cord. Mechanical injury to the adult mammalian spinal cord results in permanent loss of structural integrity at the lesion site and of the brain-controlled function distal to the lesion. Some of these consequences were permanently averted by altering the cellular constituents at the lesion site with x-irradiation delivered within a critical time window after injury. We have reported in a separate article that x-irradiation of sectioned adult rat spinal cord resulted in restitution of structural continuity and regrowth of severed corticospinal axons across and deep into the distal stump. Here, we report that after x-ray therapy of the lesion site severed corticospinal axons of transected adult rat spinal cord recover electrophysiologic control of activity of hindlimb muscles innervated by motoneurons distal to the lesion. The degree of recovery of control of muscle activity was directly related to the degree of restitution of structural integrity. This restitution of electrophysiologic function implies that the regenerating corticospinal axons reestablish connectivity with neurons within the target field in the distal stump. Our data suggest that recovery of structural continuity is a sufficient condition for the axotomized corticospinal neurons to regain some of their disrupted function in cord regions distal to the lesion site.",Included

Objectives: Videofluorography (VF) is useful for diagnosing dysphagia; however, few reports have investigated appropriate effective doses for VF. The present study aimed to estimate the effective radiation dose in VF for diagnosis of dysphagia. Method(s): Radiation doses to tissues and organs were measured using the anthropomorphic RANDO woman phantom as an equivalent to the human body. Effective doses were estimated according to the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) 60 in 1990 and IRCP 103 in 2007. The tissues measured were those recommended by ICRP 60 and ICRP 103 including gonads (ovaries and testes), red bone marrow and tissues in which excessive radiation commonly causes malignant tumours including lung, thyroid gland, stomach, large intestine, liver, oesophagus, bladder, breast, bone marrow, skin, brain and salivary gland. Skin dose was also measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters. Result(s): Using ICRP 103, the effective dose was estimated as 118.1 muSv at a tube voltage of 50 kV and 82.4 muSv at 45 kV.

The proposed deep space exploration to the moon and later to Mars will result in astronauts receiving significant chronic exposures to space radiation (SR). SR exposure results in multiple neurocognitive impairments. Recently, our cross-species (mouse/rat) studies reported impaired associative memory formation in both species following a chronic 6-month low dose exposure to a mixed field of neutrons (1 mGy/day for a total dose pf 18 cGy). In the present study, we report neutron exposure induced synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex, accompanied by microglial activation and significant synaptic loss in the hippocampus. In a parallel study, neutron exposure was also found to alter fluorescence assisted single synaptosome LTP (FASS-LTP) in the hippocampus of rats, that may be related to a reduced ability to insert AMPAR into the post-synaptic membrane, which may arise from increased phosphorylation of the serine 845 residue of the GluA1 subunit. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time, that low dose chronic neutron irradiation impacts homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-cortical circuit in two rodent species, and that the ability to successfully encode associative recognition memory is a dynamic, multicircuit process, possibly involving compensatory changes in AMPAR density on the synaptic surface.",Included
2280,"The effect of increasing concentrations of intracranial albumin on fluid flow rates within adjacent white matter tracts in rats. BACKGROUND: In most systemic cancers, tumor cells are passively carried by extracellular fluid flow to regional lymph nodes. However, the mechanism of glioma cell dissemination remains controversial, as the brain does not contain a lymphatic system. Because malignant brain tumors are characterized by a disrupted blood-brain-barrier that leaks albumin from blood vessels into brain parenchyma, we hypothesize that this albumin influx will pull water in osmotically and increase flow rates and glioma cell dissemination down adjacent white matter tracts. This may have implications for future radiation planning and steroid/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor dosing. METHOD(S): Our study examines flow rates in white matter tracts after intracranial administration of albumin. We mixed 0.12-6 mg bovine albumin with 20 muL of 2% Evans Blue and injected the mixture stereotactically into the right frontal lobes of 15 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley female rats at the gray-white matter junction over 80 minutes. Seven hours later, the rats were killed and their brains sectioned into 0.5 mm coronal slices and imaged to determine interstitial flow rates. RESULT(S): All animals tolerated the infusion without difficulty. The entire brain was white except at the site of injection and in ipsilateral white matter tracts, especially the external capsule. Average flow rates (mm/hour) for rats receiving 0.12 mg of albumin were 0.43 (coronal) and 0.13 (axial) and for those receiving 6 mg albumin were 0.99 (coronal) and 0.23 (axial). Positive correlation was observed between albumin dose administered and interstitial fluid flow rates (R = 0.57 coronal and 0.36 axial). CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates higher interstitial fluid flow rates in adjacent white matter tracts in response to albumininduced- edema. These observations provide insight into expected pathways for glioma dissemination that could be used to tailor radiation plans for individual patients. Furthermore, these findings provide a rationale for interventions to reduce glioma dissemination by limiting the extravasation of albumin through the blood-brain-barrier while local radiation is being administered.",Excluded

1421,"Primary central nervous system lymphoma: Is there still a role for radiotherapy?. Purpose of Review: Adding high-dose methotrexate to whole-brain radiotherapy improves survival in primary central nervous system lymphoma. However, the high neurotoxicity rates observed, especially in the elderly, raised interest in exploring other alternatives such as reduced-dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy-only treatments. Recent Findings: Phase II studies suggested that omitting radiotherapy decreases progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival. A randomized phase III trial testing chemotherapy with/without radiation found similar results. However, interpretation of that trial has been difficult because of the chemotherapy regimen used (methotrexate with/without ifosfamide), intrinsic methodological problems and lack of neuropsychological evaluation. It also remains unclear whether chemotherapy-only treatments could ultimately result in worse cognitive outcomes in comparison with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy because the higher rates of relapses could result in additional neurotoxicity from salvage treatments and brain damage by relapsing tumor. Given differences in relapses and neurotoxicity rates according to age, it is also unclear how results apply to younger versus older patients. Summary: Given the lack of better data, omitting radiotherapy currently seems a justifiable choice in routine practice, particularly in the elderly, but the question remains unsettled. Ongoing studies are investigating other consolidation options, including reduced-dose radiotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue, aiming at improving disease control and decreasing neurotoxicity. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
1682,"Quality of life after palliative treatment for oesophageal carcinoma - A prospective comparison between stent placement and single dose brachytherapy. Metal stent placement and single dose brachytherapy are commonly used treatment modalities for the palliation of inoperable oesophageal carcinoma. We investigated generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after these palliative treatments. Patients with dysphagia from inoperable oesophageal carcinoma were randomised to placement of a covered Ultraflex stent (n=108) or single dose (12 Gy) brachytherapy (n=101). We obtained longitudinal data on disease-specific (dysphagia score, European Organisation for Reasearch and Treament of Cancer (EORTC) OES-23, visual analogue pain scale) and generic (EORTC Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnarie (QLQ-C30), Euroqol (EQ)-5D) HRQoL at monthly home visits by a specially-trained research nurse. We compared HRQoL between the two treatments and analysed changes in HRQoL during follow-up. Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy, but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy. For generic HRQoL, there was an overall significant difference in favour of brachytherapy on four out of five functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (role, emotional, cognitive and social) (P<0.05). Generic HRQoL deteriorated over time on all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and EQ-5D, in particular physical and role functioning (on average -23 and -24 on a 100 points scale during 0.5 years of follow-up). This decline was more pronounced in the stent group. Major improvements were seen on the dysphagia and eating scales of the EORTC OES-23, in contrast to other scales of this disease-specific measure, which remained almost stable during follow-up. Reported levels of chest or abdominal pain remained stable during follow-up in both treatment groups, general pain levels increased to a minor extent. The effects of single dose brachytherapy on HRQoL compared favourably to those of stent placement for the palliation of oesophageal cancer. Future studies on palliative care for oesophageal cancer should at least include generic HRQoL scales, since these were more responsive in measuring patients' functioning and well-being during follow-up than disease-specific HRQoL scales. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

1828,"Toward Improving Patients' Experiences of Acute Toxicity From Breast Radiotherapy: Insights From the Analysis of Patient-Reported Outcomes in a Large Multicenter Cohort. PURPOSE: Understanding acute toxicities after whole-breast radiotherapy is important to inform patients, guide treatment decisions, and target supportive care. We evaluated patient-reported outcomes prospectively collected from a cohort of patients with breast cancer.METHODS: We describe the maximal toxicity reported by 8,711 patients treated between 2012 and 2019 at 27 practices. Multivariable models identified characteristics associated with (1) breast pain, (2) bother from itching, stinging/burning, swelling, or hurting of the treated breast, and (3) fatigue within 7 days of completing whole-breast radiotherapy.RESULTS: Moderate or severe breast pain was reported by 3,233 (37.1%): 1,282 (28.9%) of those receiving hypofractionation and 1,951 (45.7%) of those receiving conventional fractionation. Frequent bother from at least one breast symptom was reported by 4,424 (50.8%): 1,833 (41.3%) after hypofractionation and 2,591 (60.7%) after conventional fractionation. Severe fatigue was reported by 2,008 (23.1%): 843 (19.0%) after hypofractionation and 1,165 (27.3%) after conventional fractionation. Among patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy, younger age (P < .001), higher body mass index (BMI; P < .001), Black (P < .001) or other race (P = .002), smoking status (P < .001), larger breast volume (P = .002), lack of chemotherapy receipt (P = .004), receipt of boost treatment (P < .001), and treatment at a nonteaching center predicted breast pain. Among patients receiving conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, younger age (P < .001), higher BMI (P = .003), Black (P < .001) or other race (P = .002), diabetes (P = .001), smoking status (P < .001), and larger breast volume (P < .001) predicted breast pain.CONCLUSION: In this large observational data set, substantial differences existed according to radiotherapy dose fractionation. Race-related differences in pain existed despite controlling for multiple other factors; additional research is needed to understand what drives these differences to target potentially modifiable factors. Intensifying supportive care may be appropriate for subgroups identified as being vulnerable to greater toxicity.",Excluded

The incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is low in Australia, but these patients can present with unusual infections and imaging abnormalities. We review several common CNS pathologies that affect the HIV infected patients and discuss their MR imaging features. Our hospital provides a dedicated service to this small group of patients for the state. MR imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of CNS manifestation of HIV infection. The spectrum of disease can be categorised into 4 groups: 1. Direct consequence of HIV virus: HIV encephalitis - HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) - AIDS dementia complex. 2. Opportunistic infections including toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML), tuberculosis, cryptococcosis and cytomegalovirus infection. 3. Neoplasm predominantly due to CNS lymphoma. 4. Consequence of HIV treatment: Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) related to antiviral treatment.

In the present experiments a similar effect occurred in naturally-stimulated ganglia. It occurred when the preganglionic impulses were either evoked by electrical stimulation of the preganglionic nerve or were discharged spontaneously from the central nervous system. Thus increased turnover of phosphatidylinositol appears to be a normal accompaniment of synaptic transmission in these ganglia.",Excluded

It is now possible to examine in detail exchanges between sister chromatids (SCEs) and to attempt to investigate the relationships of such exchanges to aberration formation and DNA-repair mechanisms. The frequency of SCEs is dramatically increased by chemical mutagens and may reflect the level of DNA damage. Lymphocytes from patients with ataxia telangiectasis (AT) show high levels of spontaneous chromosome damage and are hypersentive to ionising radiations and it was of interest to examine the levels of SCE induced in these cells by various mutagens. The frequencies of SCE after treatment with X=rays or three chemical mutagens were equivalent to those in normal cells. The effects of fluorodeoxyuridine and deoxycytidine on SCE frequencies were also tested.,Excluded

OBJECTIVES: The RTOG 9402 trial reported an improved Outcome in IDH mutant and 1p19q-codeleted anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors after chemotherapy (CT) with radiotherapy (RT). We evaluated the efficacy of CT and RT in patients with IDH mutant, 1p19q-noncodeleted secondary high-grade astrocytoma (sHGA) WHO grades III and IV. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment data from 109 patients with sHGA grades III and IV, developed from histologically confirmed low-grade astrocytoma grade II were retrospectively analyzed. IDH mutation-, 1p19q/codeletion- and MGMT-promoter methylation status were evaluable in all patients. Progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) in relation to adjuvant treatment modalities and molecular profiling were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULT(S): Out of 109 patients, 88 patients (80.7%) harbored an IDH1 or 2 mutations, 30 patients a 1p19q-codeletion (27.5%), and 63 patients (57.8%) exhibited a methylated MGMT-promoter status. During the follow-up time 57 patients (52.2%) died. The postsurgical treatment for the 88 IDH mutant sHGA included: RT alone in 17 patients (19.3%), a combined RT and CT (RCT) in 48 patients (54.5%) and CT alone in 20 patients (22.7%). 3 patients did not receive any adjuvant treatment due to bad neurological conditions. At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, the median OS of all IDH mutant sHGA was 5.67 years (1.9-17.4 years). The OS in patients who received RCT was 6.4 years, which is significantly longer compared with those who underwent RT alone (1.2 years, hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.32-0.51. p = 0.011). After including only IDH mutant sHGA patients without a 1p19q-codeletion, the Kaplan-Meier curves estimates a significantly improved OS in the RCT cohort (33 patients) in comparison to patients who received RT alone (10 patients) (6.4 vs 1.2 years, hazard ratio 0.4, 95% CI 0.34-0.6, p= 0.022).

2120,"Electrophysiological characterization of interlaminar entorhinal connections: an essential link for re-entrance in the hippocampal-entorhinal system. The hippocampal formation communicates with the neocortex mainly through the adjacent entorhinal cortex. Neurons projecting to the hippocampal formation are found in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex and are largely segregated from the neurons receiving hippocampal output, which are located in deep entorhinal layers. We studied the communication between deep and superficial entorhinal layers in the anaesthetized rat using field potential recordings, current source density analysis and single unit measurements. We found that subiculum stimulation was able to excite entorhinal neurons in deep layers. This response was followed by current sinks in superficial layers. Both responses were subject to frequency dependent facilitation, but not depression. Selective blockade of deep layer responses also abolished subsequent superficial layer responses. This clearly demonstrates a functional deep-to-superficial layer communication in the entorhinal cortex, which can be triggered by hippocampal output. This pathway may provide a means by which processed hippocampal output is integrated or compared with new incoming information in superficial entorhinal layers, and it constitutes an important link in the process of re-entrance of activity in the hippocampal-entorhinal network, which may be important for consolidation of memories or retaining information for short periods.",Excluded
1206,"Local irradiation not only induces homing of human mesenchymal stem cells at exposed sites but promotes their widespread engraftment to multiple organs: A study of their quantitative distribution after irradiation damage. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to migrate to various tissues. There is little information on the fate and potential therapeutic efficacy of the reinfusion of MSCs following total body irradiation (TBI). We addressed this question using human MSC (hMSCs) infused to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to TBI. Further, we tested the impact of additional local irradiation (ALI) superimposed to TBI, as a model of accidental irradiation. NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with hMSCs. Group 1 was not irradiated before receiving hMSC infusion. Group 2 received only TBI at a dose of 3.5 Gy, group 3 received local irradiation to the abdomen at a dose of 4.5 Gy in addition to TBI, and group 4 received local irradiation to the leg at 26.5 Gy in addition to TBI. Fifteen days after irradiation, quantitative and spatial distribution of the hMSCs were studied. Histological analysis of mouse tissues confirmed the presence of radio-induced lesions in the irradiated fields. Following their infusion into nonirradiated animals, hMSCs homed at a very low level to various tissues (lung, bone marrow, and muscles) and no significant engraftment was found in other organs. TBI induced an increase of engraftment levels of hMSCs in the brain, heart, bone marrow, and muscles. Abdominal irradiation (AI) as compared with leg irradiation (LI) increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (the gut, liver, and spleen). Hind LI as compared with AI increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (skin, quadriceps, and muscles). An increase of hMSC engraftment in organs outside the fields of the ALI was also observed. Conversely, following LI, hMSC engraftment was increased in the brain as compared with AI. This study shows that engraftment of hMSCs in NOD/SCID mice with significantly increased in response to tissue injuries following TBI with or without ALI. ALI induced an increase of the level of engraftment at sites outside the local irradiation field, thus suggesting a distant (abscopal) effect of radiation damage. This work supports the use of MSCs to repair damaged normal tissues following accidental irradiation and possibly in patients submitted to radiotherapy. ©AlphaMed Press.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To determine the detection rate of intracranial vessel occlusions using CT perfusion-based wavelet-transformed angiography (waveletCTA) in acute ischemic stroke patients, in whom single-phase CTA (spCTA) failed to detect an occlusion.METHODS: Subjects were selected from a cohort of 791 consecutive patients who underwent multiparametric CT including whole-brain CT perfusion. Inclusion criteria were (1) significant cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficit, (2) no evidence of vessel occlusion on spCTA and (3) follow-up-confirmed acute ischemic infarction. waveletCTA was independently analysed by two readers regarding presence and location of vessel occlusions. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of waveletCTA-detected occlusions.RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall, an occlusion was identified using waveletCTA in 31 (52.5 %) patients with negative spCTA. Out of 47 patients with middle cerebral artery infarction, 27 occlusions (57.4 %) were detected by waveletCTA, mainly located in the M2 (15) and M3 segments (8). The presence of waveletCTA-detected occlusions was associated with larger CBF deficit volumes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.335, p = 0.010) and shorter times from symptom onset (OR = 0.306, p = 0.041).CONCLUSIONS: waveletCTA is able to detect spCTA occult vessel occlusions in about half of acute ischemic stroke patients and may potentially identify more patients eligible for endovascular therapy.KEY POINTS: * waveletCTA is able to detect spCTA occult vessel occlusions in stroke patients. * waveletCTA-detected occlusions are associated with larger cerebral blood flow deficits. * waveletCTA has the potential to identify more patients eligible for endovascular therapy. * waveletCTA implies neither additional radiation exposure nor extra contrast agent.",Excluded
1845,"Validation of a death assay for Angiostrongylus cantonensis larvae (L3) using propidium iodide in a rat model (Rattus norvegicus). Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a pathogenic nematode and the cause of neuroangiostrongyliasis, an eosinophilic meningitis more commonly known as rat lungworm disease. Transmission is thought to be primarily due to ingestion of infective third stage larvae (L3) in gastropods, on produce, or in contaminated water. The gold standard to determine the effects of physical and chemical treatments on the infectivity of A. cantonensis L3 larvae is to infect rodents with treated L3 larvae and monitor for infection, but animal studies are laborious and expensive and also raise ethical concerns. This study demonstrates propidium iodide (PI) to be a reliable marker of parasite death and loss of infective potential without adversely affecting the development and future reproduction of live A. cantonensis larvae. PI staining allows evaluation of the efficacy of test substances in vitro, an improvement upon the use of lack of motility as an indicator of death. Some potential applications of this assay include determining the effectiveness of various anthelmintics, vegetable washes, electromagnetic radiation and other treatments intended to kill larvae in the prevention and treatment of neuroangiostrongyliasis.

Background Information: The acoustic properties of urinary fluid and the superficial location of the bladder make it an excellent candidate for sonographic evaluation. In addition to being a quick and portable screening modality and offering the added benefit of not exposing the patient to ionizing radiation, ultrasound can definitively diagnose a variety of pathologic processes of the bladder, both benign and malignant. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Briefly discuss ultrasound technique used in optimal evaluation of the bladder. Discuss normal sonographic appearance of the bladder. Illustrate and describe the imaging appearance associated with a variety of both benign and malignant bladder pathologies. Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Using ultrasound as the primary imaging modality, and with CT and MRI support, a variety of common and not so common pathologies of the bladder will be illustrated and discussed. These will include benign entities such as cystitis, calculi, bladder hernias, neurogenic bladder, ureterocele, bladder rupture and fistulization, foreign bodies, bladder endometriosis, and pseudotumors. Malignant processes such as urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and metastatic disease will also be included. The emphasis will be on the role of ultrasound in narrowing the differential, and in suggesting the need for further radiologic or urologic evaluation.

The cyclooxygenase-2 isoform (COX-2) was found recently to be constitutively expressed in the guinea pig inner ear. To gain knowledge about its role in sound perception, alterations in the COX-2 level of moderate noise-stimulated cochleae were determined. Staining intensities were quantified in different regions using an immunohistochemical staining procedure and computer-assisted system. After 70 dB and 90 dB noise exposure for 1 h at 8000 Hz, COX-2 downregulation was observed in the organ of Corti, which was most prominent in Deiters' cells near Hensen cells and outer hair cells. In pillar cells, COX-2 levels were only slightly reduced after 70 dB but strongly diminished after 90 dB exposure. In Hensen cells, COX-2 was downregulated after 70 dB stimulation, revealing a decreasing COX-2 content from the third to the first turn of the cochlea and a homogeneously reduced enzyme expression in all three turns after 90 dB. The COX-2 content in inner hair cells was nearly identical to unexposed cochleae after 70 dB exposure but significantly reduced after 90 dB stimulation. In spiral ganglion cells, stria vascularis, spiral ligament and limbus, COX-2 expression was unchanged after 70 dB and 90 dB. We suggest that alterations in COX-2 expression might contribute to diminished sensitivity at the cochlea after noise exposure to reduce subsequent noise distress, termed sound conditioning.",Excluded

PURPOSE: A prospective study was performed to formally relate dose-dependent radiologically defined changes in normal brain induced by radiotherapy (RT) to neurocognitive dysfunction in subjects with primary brain tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult patients receiving three-dimensional RT for central nervous system (CNS) tumors were enrolled. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and neuropsychological testing were performed before RT and 3 weeks and 6 months after treatment. Analyses were performed for correlations between changes in 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG)-PET (metabolism), (15)O-PET (relative blood flow), regional radiation dose, follow-up time, and neuropsychological test scores.RESULTS: Eleven subjects were enrolled and 6 completed follow-up studies. The PET data showed reduced FDG uptake, with average decreases of 2-6% in regions of the brain receiving greater than 40 Gy at 3 weeks' and 6 months' follow-up. The (15)O-H(2)O PET showed increases (<10%) at 3 weeks in relative regional blood flow in brain receiving greater than 30 Gy, but less at the 6-month follow-up studies. There were significant correlations between decreases in FDG uptake and increased scores from the Symptom Checklist-90-R, with an average increase in T score of 2 (p < 0.0001). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test showed a significant correlation of decreased FDG uptake with increased errors and perseveration in test performance, with an average decrease in T score of 11 (p = 0.037).CONCLUSIONS: A dose-dependent response of CNS tissue was detected using FDG PET in this small number of patients. Decreases in CNS metabolism correlated with decreased performance on neuropsychological tests for problem solving, cognitive flexibility, and global measures of psychopathology.

The light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) has rapidly become an important tool in neuroscience, and its use is being considered in therapeutic interventions. Although wild-type and known variant ChR2s are able to drive light-activated spike trains, their use in potential clinical applications is limited by either low light sensitivity or slow channel kinetics. We present a new variant, calcium translocating channelrhodopsin (CatCh), which mediates an accelerated response time and a voltage response that is ~70-fold more light sensitive than that of wild-type ChR2. CatCh's superior properties stem from its enhanced Ca2(+) permeability. An increase in [Ca2(+)](i) elevates the internal surface potential, facilitating activation of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and indirectly increasing light sensitivity. Repolarization following light-stimulation is markedly accelerated by Ca2(+)-dependent BK channel activation. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown principle: shifting permeability from monovalent to divalent cations to increase sensitivity without compromising fast kinetics of neuronal activation. This paves the way for clinical use of light-gated channels.",Excluded

Aim: To observe the therapeutic efficacy and prognostic factors that influence survival rates in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with multiple brain metastases (BMs), (more than three and less than ten). Method(s): Retrospective analyses were conducted on the clinical data of 209 NSCLC patients with multiple BMs and were admitted to our hospital between March 2007 and November 2012. All BM patients received whole-brain radiotherapy. Two hundred patients received combined chemotherapy during the treatment process; 99 received targeted drug therapy; and nine got only symptomatic and supportive treatment. Survival time was defined as the period from the start of BM therapy to the patient's death or end of the follow-up period. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the median survival time, and the 6-month, 1-, and 2-year cumulative survival rates, as well as to plot the survival curves. The patients' cultural background included their socioeconomic status, level of education, their understanding of the disease, and the degree of care and support they received from their family members. Log-rank test was employed to test the differences in the survival rates between the subgroups. Cox multivariate regression analyses were used to analyze the various factors influencing the prognoses of NSCLC with multiple BMs. Result(s): The follow-up duration was between 1 and 87 months. The median survival time for all BM patients was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 9.37-14.83). The 6-month, 1-, and 2-year cumulative survival rates were 80%, 50.2%, and 10.7%, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that the independent factors influencing survival prognoses included Karnofsky Performance Status score, control of the primary lung tumor, interval between the confirmed diagnoses of lung cancer and BM, presence of extracranial metastasis, number of chemotherapy cycles undergone, Graded Prognostic Assessment class, administration of combined targeted drug therapy, the pathological type, and the cultural backgrounds of the patients. Multivariate analyses indicated that the number of chemotherapy cycles, administration of combined drug therapy, and patients' cultural background were key independent factors influencing survival prognoses. Conclusion(s): Active treatment of NSCLC with multiple BMs was beneficial, and the patients' cultural background had a strong influence on survival prognoses. Chemotherapy combined with targeted drug therapy could increase the patients' median and overall survival rates. The number of chemotherapy cycles undergone, administration of combined targeted drug therapy, and the cultural backgrounds of the patients had significant effects on the patients' survival prognoses.

1846,"Feasibility of setting up generic alert levels for maximum skin dose in fluoroscopically guided procedures. Purpose: The feasibility of setting-up generic, hospital-independent dose alert levels to initiate vigilance on possible skin injuries in interventional procedures was studied for three high-dose procedures (chemoembolization (TACE) of the liver, neuro-embolization (NE) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) in 9 European countries. Method(s): Gafchromic films and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used to determine the Maximum Skin Dose (MSD). Correlation of the online dose indicators (fluoroscopy time, kerma- or dose-area product (KAP or DAP) and cumulative air kerma at interventional reference point (K<inf>a,r</inf>)) with MSD was evaluated and used to establish the alert levels corresponding to a MSD of 2 Gy and 5 Gy. The uncertainties of alert levels in terms of DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf>, and uncertainty of MSD were calculated. Result(s): About 20-30% of all MSD values exceeded 2 Gy while only 2-6% exceeded 5 Gy. The correlations suggest that both DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf> can be used as a dose indicator for alert levels (Pearson correlation coefficient p mostly >0.8), while fluoroscopy time is not suitable (p mostly <0.6). Generic alert levels based on DAP (Gy cm<sup>2</sup>) were suggested for MSD of both 2 Gy and 5 Gy (for 5 Gy: TACE 750, PCI 250 and NE 400). The suggested levels are close to the lowest values published in several other studies. The uncertainty of the MSD was estimated to be around 10-15% and of hospital-specific skin dose alert levels about 20-30% (with coverage factor k = 1). Conclusion(s): The generic alert levels are feasible for some cases but should be used with caution, only as the first approximation, while hospital-specific alert levels are preferred as the final approach.

Patients with testicular cancer are at risk of having severe short-term and life-threatening long-term effects; we reviewed previous reports of these sequelae. After orchidectomy and before further treatment patients have major mental distress which gradually decreases during the treatment phase. Gastrointestinal side-effects dominate during both chemo- and radiotherapy, with the risk of severe haematological, infectious and thromboembolic complications during chemotherapy. Long-term sequelae comprise second cancers, cardiovascular morbidity/mortality and gonadal dysfunction. Nevertheless, 70% of patients who attempt paternity after treatment are successful. About 20% of patients develop long-term neuro- and/or ototoxicity. The long-term quality of life of survivors of testicular cancer is comparable to that of controls. Risk-adapted treatment of patients with testicular cancer and adequate follow-up of those at risk of life-threatening toxicity are ways to reduce the short- and long-term morbidity in survivors. Patients should be informed about these potential complications and the importance of adjusting their lifestyle (e.g. smoking habits, physical activity and weight control).

1280,"Glycoprotein 41 Targeted Radioimmunotherapy as a Novel Treatment for NeuroHIV/AIDS. The HIV epidemic is a major global health threat. Nowadays HIV-infected individuals live much longer due to the inhibition of the viral replication by combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART). However, cART fails to eradicate the residual HIV-infected cells, therefore, virus persists and continues to cause damage both systemically and to central nervous system (CNS). HIV enters the CNS in infected monocytes shortly after peripheral exposure. The infection of CNS poses a challenge due to strict regulation of the entry of molecules into the brain by the blood brain barrier (BBB) which limits many cART regimens from reaching effective levels in the brain. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) uses antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for targeted delivery of cytocidal ionizing radiations to cells. The distinct advantages of RIT are its relative independence from the immune status of the patient and secondly, it is not subject to drug resistance mechanisms. These features are very useful in the management of HIV-infected individuals. The challenge in extending the RIT approach to the elimination of HIV in the CNS lies in the difficulty of the therapeutic molecules to penetrate through the BBB. Recently we have demonstrated that an antibody 2556 to gp41 was able to penetrate the in vitro human BBB and to kill infected cells in the brain compartment of the BBB model (McFarren et al AIDS 2016). In this study we have identified six human mAbs with higher pI (> 8.5) that recognizes a conserved region of HIV gp41. The penetration of these antibodies through in vitro human BBB model was pI dependent. We are now using these novel gp41-binding human mAbs conjugated with three different radioisotopes (<sup>213</sup>Bi, <sup>188</sup>Re or <sup>177</sup>Lu) enabling their more efficient penetration into the CNS through the intact BBB. To achieve this, monocytes are infected with HIV and then treated with radiolabelled mAbs. Finally, to validate these novel radiolabeled molecules, we will use a human in vitro BBB model to assess the ability of these mAbs to penetrate the BBB and to kill the HIV infected monocytes in the brain compartment of the BBB model. This study will provide a novel treatment option for the eradication of HIV-1 infection and will also be useful for treatment of drug-resistant HIV strains.

The DTI data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics and the GM volume was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Compared with the pre-RT group, the mean FA values in the left parietal lobe white matter (WM) and right cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05). In addition, the mean FA values in the right parietal lobe WM decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05), compared with the pre-RT group. The FA level in the right temporal lobe remained significantly decreased, compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT. Furthermore, compared with pre-RT group, the GM volume in the bilateral frontal lobe, right occipital lobe, left parietal lobe, right temporal lobe and left cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05), and in the bilateral temporal lobe, parietal lobe, right frontal lobe and left cerebellum, the GM volume decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05). The GM volume in the right temporal lobe, bilateral frontal lobe and bilateral cerebellum remained significantly decreased compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT. A combination of DTI and VBM may be used to determine radiation-induced brain injury in patients treated for NPC. Copyright © 2017, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included

2058,"The Treatment of Melanoma Brain Metastases. Melanoma is the malignancy with the highest rate of dissemination to the central nervous system once it metastasizes. Until recently, the prognosis of patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM) was poor. In recent years, however, the prognosis has improved due to high-resolution imaging that facilitates early detection of small asymptomatic brain metastases and early intervention with local modalities such as stereotactic radiosurgery. More recently, a number of systemic therapies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for metastatic melanoma, resulting in improved survival for many MBM patients. Registration trials for these newer therapies excluded patients with untreated brain metastases, and a number of studies specifically tailored to this population of patients have been conducted or are underway. Herein, we review contemporary locoregional and systemic therapies and describe the unique challenges posed by treatment of brain metastases, such as radionecrosis, cerebral edema, and pseudoprogression. Since the number of systemic and combined modality clinical trials has increased, we expect that the treatment landscape for patients with melanoma brain metastasis will change dramatically. In addition to ongoing clinical trials, which show great promise, we conclude that our understanding of intracranial metastasis remains quite limited. In addition to inter-disciplinary, multi-modality studies, bench-side work to better understand the process of cerebrotropism is needed to fuel more drug development and further improve outcomes.

1729,"Protection of normal brain cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis by a mitochondria-targeted triphenyl-phosphonium-nitroxide: a possible utility in glioblastoma therapy. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor. A strong rationale to identify innovative approaches to treat these tumors is required since treatment failures result in local recurrences and median survivals range from 9 to 12 months. Glioma cells are reported to have less mitochondrial content compared to adjacent normal brain cells. Based on this difference, we suggest a new strategy, utilizing protection of normal brain cells by mitochondria-targeted electron scavengers and antioxidants-nitroxides-thus allowing for the escalation of the radiation doses. In this paper, we report that a conjugate of nitroxide with a hydrophobic cation, triphenyl-phosphonium (TPEY-Tempo), significantly protected brain endothelial cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis while radiosensitizing brain tumor cells. Thus, TPEY-Tempo may be a promising adjunct in the treatment of glioblastoma with the potential to not only prolong survival but also to maintain quality of life and reduce treatment toxicity.",Included

PURPOSE: The aim was to examine low-level 7 Hz-modulated 450 MHz radiation effects on human performance in visually presented neuropsychological tasks associated with attention and short-term memory.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A homogeneous group of 100 subjects (37 female, 63 male) were randomly assigned to either the exposed (10-20 min, 0.158 mW cm(-2)) or the sham-exposed group. A battery of three different tests measured attention and short-term memory. Task 1 involved alternately selecting black digits from 1 to 25 in ascending order and white digits from 24 to 1 in descending order. The time spent on the task and the number of errors were recorded and analysed. Task 2 involved viewing a picture of 12 objects during 3 s, followed by a list of 24 words. The subject was required to select words representing previously presented objects. In task 3, an array of letters in 10 rows (60 in each row) was presented, and the subject was required to identify all examples of a particular two-letter combination.RESULTS: The results of tasks 1 and 3 showed a significant increase in variances of errors (p<0.05) in the exposed versus the sham-exposed group. The results of task 2 indicated a significant decrease in errors (p<0.05) in the exposed group.CONCLUSIONS: The data provide additional evidence that acute low-level exposure to microwaves modulated at 7 Hz can affect cognitive processes such as attention and short-term memory.",Excluded

Background: Using patient-reported and objective assessment tools, we sought to quantify cognitive symptoms and objective cognitive dysfunction in patients irradiated for skull base cancer. Method(s): Participants were assessed using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck module (MDASI-HN), with subsequent analysis. Result(s): Of the 122 participants analyzed, the majority (63%) had no frank detectable cognitive impairment by TICS, with frank impairment in 6%. Overall, mean patient-reported problems with memory (MDASI<inf>memory</inf>) was 3.3 (SD +/-2.66). On recursive partition analysis, the MDASI<inf>memory</inf> cutoff point of >=5 was associated with detectable cognitive impairment by TICS (logworth 1.69; P =.02), yet no MDASI<inf>memory</inf> threshold was associated with unambiguous absence of impairment by TICS. Conclusion(s): Approximately one third of patients had ambiguous results by TICS assessment, for whom more rigorous testing may be warranted. Moderate to severe levels of patient-reported memory complaints on the MDASI-HN module may have utility as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction in this population.

We report two cases of adults with refractory aggressive behaviour due to a neurological condition (one mainly with self-inflicted behaviour) with dramatic response to therapy with allopurinol, 300 mg/day p.o.

We hypothesized that chronic administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, to young adult male rats would prevent/ameliorate fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive impairment. Eighty 12-14-week-old young adult male Fischer 344 rats received either: (1) sham irradiation, (2) 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation delivered as two 5 Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks, (3) sham irradiation plus continuous administration of 15 mg/L of ramipril in the drinking water starting 3 days before irradiation, or (4) fractionated whole-brain irradiation plus ramipril. Cognitive function was assessed using a perirhinal cortex-dependent version of the novel object recognition task 26 weeks after irradiation. Microglial activation was determined in the perirhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus 28 weeks after irradiation using the ED1 antibody. Neurogenesis was assessed in the granular cell layer and subgranular zones of the dentate gyrus using a doublecortin antibody. Fractionated whole-brain irradiation led to: (1) a significant impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, (2) a significant increase in activated microglia in the dentate gyrus but not in the perirhinal cortex, and (3) a significant decrease in neurogenesis. Continuous administration of ramipril before, during, and after irradiation prevented the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced changes in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, as well as in microglial activation in the dentate gyrus. Thus, as hypothesized, continuous administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, can prevent the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function.",Included

The preoperative and postoperative KPS scores at three months significantly differed in both groups (P = 0.000, 0.032). The clinical efficacy at postoperative three months significantly differed between the two groups (Z = -2.048, P < 0.05). In the PET/CT group, the effective rate at postoperative three months was 61.35% (32/52), significantly higher than the 42.30% (22/52) in the control group (P = 0.032).

The radioisotope cisternogram has proven itself to be a valuable diagnostic procedure during the evaluation of patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. If it is not possible to define the origin of such a leak, extensive intracranial explorations may be required, which may or may not result in successful correction of the defect. As a functional examination with limited risk to the patient and minimal radiation exposure, the isotopic cisternogram can either establish a diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea or eliminate cerebrospinal fluid as a cause for rhinorrhea. When occurring, CSF leaks can be shown by demonstrating a ""path"" from the cranial fossage into the nasal cavity. The present technique utilizes tampons placed in each nostril. A positive diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea is made by finding a tampon impregnated with at least twice the radioactivity of a control tampon from the opposite nostril (in the presence of an intact septum). Conclusions indicate that a positive anterior fossa cisternogram may be the only evidence for hidden site of CSF leakage, especially when other signs are lacking.",Excluded
1949,"Evaluation of a new foetal shielding device for pregnant brain tumour patients. Background: The present study aimed to propose a new foetal shielding device for pregnant cancer patients to reduce the foetal dose associated with treatment techniques using multiple gantry angles, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Method(s): Three shielding structures were designed to minimise the scattered and leaked radiation from various gantry angles and radiation scattering within the patient. The base-plate part that can be placed on the treatment couch was designed to reduce the scattered and leaked radiation generated at gantry angles located near 180degree. A body shielding part that can cover the lower chest and abdomen was designed, and a neck-shielding structure was added to reduce the internal and external radiation scattering from the treatment area. Evaluation plans were generated to assess the foetal dose reduction by the foetal shielding device in terms of the shielding material thickness, distance from the field edge, and shielding component using the flattened 6 MV photon beam (6MV) and flattening filter-free 6 MV photon beam (6MV-FFF). In addition, the effectiveness of the foetal shielding device was evaluated in a pregnant brain tumour patient. Result(s): The shielding material consisting of three parts was placed on frames composed of four arch shapes with a vertical curved structure, connection bar at the top position, and base plate. Each shielding part resulted in reductions in the radiation dose according to the treatment technique, as the thickness of the shielding material increased and the foetal dose decreased. In addition, a foetal dose reduction of approximately 50% was confirmed at 50 cm from the field edge by using the designed shielding device in most delivery techniques. In patients, the newly designed shielding structures can effectively eliminate up to about 49% of the foetal dose generated from various gantry angles used in VMAT or IMRT. Conclusion(s): We designed a foetal shielding device consisting of three parts to effectively reduce the dose delivered to the foetus, and evaluated the device with various treatment techniques for a pregnant patient with brain tumour. The foetal shielding device shielded the scattered/leaked radiation from the treatment machine, and also effectively reduced internal scattering from the treatment area in the patient.

The purpose of our experiments was to examine the possible influence of the hypothalamus in supporting cellular proliferation, and thus adenoma growth. Fragments from four human pituitary adenomas (three pituitary prolactinomas; one ACTH-secreting adenoma) were transplanted into the pituitary fossa of total-body irradiated, hypophysectomized rats. The rats were killed after two weeks and perfused with a mixture of formalin and India ink. Histologic examination of serial sagittal sections through the pituitary fossa and the adjacent brain showed: vascularization of the grafts from the pituitary stalk and from the scar tissue in the sphenoid bone; survival of some adenomas; and numerous mitoses in an ACTH-secreting specimen obtained from a patient who had Cushing's disease. We conclude from these experiments that as yet unidentified hypothalamus factors are essential for the growth of certain types of pituitary adenomas.",Excluded
1864,"Increased hippocampal TrkA expression ameliorates cranial radiation-induced neurogenesis impairment and cognitive deficit via PI3K/AKT signaling. Cognitive deficit is one of the most serious complications of cranial radiotherapy of head and neck cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of this cognitive impairment remains unclear. In the present study, the role of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and its ligand neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) were investigated following whole-brain irradiation (WBI). Young male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent WBI at a single dose of 10 Gy. WBI was determined to result in notable memory decline and substantial neurogenesis impairment in the hippocampus 3 months post-irradiation. Compared with the control group, TrkA protein expression was greater in irradiated rats 1 week after WBI, which then decreased significantly by the 3-month time-point. However, no difference in NGF expression was observed from 1 day to 3 months post-WBI. Overexpression of hippocampal TrkA in rats using adeno-associated virus ameliorated memory decline induced by irradiation. Additionally, upregulating TrkA expression rescued irradiation-induced hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and promoted neurogenesis. PI3K, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were also revealed to be significantly inhibited by WBI, which was ameliorated by TrkA overexpression. Findings of the present study indicated that the TrkA-dependent signaling pathway may serve a critical role in radiotherapy-induced cognitive deficit and impairments in neurogenesis.",Included

2291,"Overview of results of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 3 radiolabeled somatostatin analogs. A new treatment modality for inoperable or metastasized gastroenteropancreatic tumors is the use of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs. Initial studies with high doses of [(111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)(0)]octreotide in patients with metastasized neuroendocrine tumors were encouraging, although partial remissions were uncommon. Another radiolabeled somatostatin analog that is used for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is [(90)Y-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide. Various phase 1 and phase 2 PRRT trials have been performed with this compound. Despite differences in the protocols used, complete and partial remissions in most of the studies with [(90)Y-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide were in the same ranges, 10%-30%; these ranges were higher than those obtained with [(111)In-DTPA(0)]octreotide. Treatment with the newest radiolabeled somatostatin analog, [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate, which has a higher affinity for the subtype 2 somatostatin receptor, resulted in complete or partial remissions in 30% of 76 patients. Tumor regression was positively correlated with a high level of uptake on OctreoScan imaging, a limited hepatic tumor mass, and a high Karnofsky performance score. Treatment with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs is a promising new tool in the management of patients with inoperable or metastasized neuroendocrine tumors. Symptomatic improvement may occur with all (111)In-, (90)Y-, or (177)Lu-labeled somatostatin analogs that have been used for PRRT. The results obtained with [(90)Y-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide and [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate are very encouraging in terms of tumor regression. Also, if kidney protective agents are used, the side effects of this therapy are few and mild, and the duration of the therapy response for both radiopharmaceuticals is more than 2 y. These data compare favorably with those for the limited number of alternative treatment approaches. [References: 19]",Excluded

Background: Acute in situ thrombosis is an ischaemic phenomenon during Pipeline embolisation device (PED) procedures with potentially high morbidity and mortality. There is controversy regarding the role of platelet function testing with P2Y12 assay as a predictor of intraprocedural thromboembolic events. There is limited knowledge on whether procedural complexity influences these events.Methods: Data were collected retrospectively on 742 consecutive PED cases at a single institution. Patients with intraprocedural acute thrombosis were compared with patients without these events.Results: A cohort of 37 PED cases with acute in situ thrombosis (mean age 53.8 years, mean aneurysm size 8.4 mm) was matched with a cohort of 705 PED cases without intraprocedural thromboembolic events (mean age 56.4 years, mean aneurysm size 6.9 mm). All patients with in situ thrombosis received intra-arterial and/or intravenous abciximab. The two groups were evenly matched in patient demographics, previous treatment/subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and aneurysm location. There was no statistical difference in postprocedural P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values between the two groups, with a mean of 156 in the in situ thrombosis group vs 148 in the control group (p=0.5894). Presence of cervical carotid tortuosity, high cavernous internal carotid artery grade, need for multiple PED and vasospasm were not significantly different between the two groups. The in situ thrombosis group had statistically significant longer fluoroscopy time (60.4 vs 38.4 min, p<0.0001), higher radiation exposure (3476 vs 2160 mGy, p<0.0001), higher rates of adjunctive coiling (24.3% vs 8.37%, p=0.0010) and higher utilisation of balloon angioplasty (37.8% vs 12.2%, p<0.0001). Clinically, the in situ thrombosis cohort had higher incidence of major and minor stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage and length of stay.Conclusions: Predictors of procedural complexity (higher radiation exposure, longer fluoroscopy time, adjunctive coiling and need for balloon angioplasty) are associated with acute thrombotic events during PED placement, independent of PRU values.",Excluded

Objectives The inducible GPCR B1 receptor (B1R) is a molecular signature of several types of solid cancers, including brain cancer. It is thought to be involved in tumor growth, invasion and angiogenesis. Thus, the B1R may represent a highly promising new target for the development of cancer-targeted theranostic agents Methods We developed a new 64Cu/NOTA-conjugated analog of our potent, selective B1R peptide antagonist, R-954 (AcOrn[Oic2,(alphaMe)Phe5,DbetaNal7,Ile8]-desArg9-bradykinin). Stability of the resulting peptide conjugate was evaluated ex vivo in undiluted rat blood samples and in vivo within systemic circulation in healthy rats. Intracellular uptake/nuclear localization and radiocytotoxicity of the conjugate were studied in cultured F98 glioma cells. In vivo biodistribution profile and efficacy of detection of malignant brain tumors by PET, were evaluated using the syngeneic, orthotopic F98 glioma rat model Results 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 showed remarkable stability in rat plasma after a 24h incubation. In vivo stability study showed mainly intact radiolabeled peptide (no occurrence of radiotracer metabolites) in rat blood circulation and urine, 90min after tail-vein injection. In vitro, the conjugate supressed, in a concentration-dependent manner, clonogenic growth of F98 cells possibly through an intracellular radiation mechanism (i.e. via cellular/nuclear uptake). Intravenous 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 properly detected relatively small brain tumors by PET at 1.5h and 20h after injection. Moreover, muPET signals coincided perfectly with those of contrast-enhanced MRI. The conjugate exhibited high tumor-to-contralateral background uptake and tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios (18:1 and 6:1, respectively) at 20h after injection. muPET signals generated by the radiotracer were i) inhibitable with excess of the unlabeled B1R antagonist R-954, ii) substantially reduced in B1R-knockdown F98 tumors, and iii) primarily absent in sham-operated animals, thus confirming the B1R-targeted tumor uptake specificity of the conjugate Conclusions Our findings provide initial proof-of-concept for the potential use of 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 radiotracer in both diagnosis and treatment of brain cancer, and possibly other types of B1R-positive solid cancers.",Excluded
1598,"Antiphosphatidylserine antibody combined with irradiation damages tumor blood vessels and induces tumor immunity in a rat model of glioblastoma. PURPOSE: The vascular targeting antibody bavituximab is being combined with chemotherapy in clinical trials in cancer patients. Bavituximab targets the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylserine, complexed with beta2-glycoprotein I. Phosphatidylserine is normally intracellular but becomes exposed on the luminal surface of vascular endothelium in tumors. Phosphatidylserine exposure on tumor vessels is increased by chemotherapy and irradiation. Here, we determined whether treatment with the murine equivalent of bavituximab, 2aG4, combined with irradiation can suppress tumor growth in a rat model of glioblastoma.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: F98 glioma cells were injected into the brains of syngeneic rats where they grow initially as a solid tumor and then infiltrate throughout the brain. Rats with established tumors were treated with 10 Gy whole brain irradiation and 2aG4.RESULTS: Combination treatment doubled the median survival time of the rats, and 13% of animals were rendered disease free. Neither treatment given individually was as effective. We identified two mechanisms. First, irradiation induced phosphatidylserine exposure on tumor blood vessels and enhanced antibody-mediated destruction of tumor vasculature by monocytes/macrophages. Second, the antibody treatment induced immunity to F98 tumor cells, which are normally weakly immunogenic. Surviving rats were immune to rechallenge with F98 tumor cells. In vitro, 2aG4 enhanced the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to generate F98-specific cytotoxic T cells. Phosphatidylserine exposure, which is induced on tumor cells by irradiation, likely suppresses tumor antigen presentation, and 2aG4 blocks this tolerogenic effect.CONCLUSION: Bavituximab combined with radiotherapy holds promise as a vascular targeting and immune enhancement strategy for the treatment of human glioblastoma.",Excluded
1984,"Brain metastases in relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer after chemotherapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Background: Brain metastases in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) occur rarely and are associated with a poor prognosis. No significant risk factors have been identified and no evidence-based treatment guidelines are currently available. Case Report: A 56-year-old EOC patient presented with seizure at the Emergency Department eleven days after completion of fourth-line chemotherapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PhD). A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple metastases. The patient received radiotherapy with a total dose of 30.8 Gy and 8 cycles of paclitaxel resulting in stable disease. Based on the current literature, treatment options are discussed. Conclusion(s): Therapeutic options for brain metastases include radiation, systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, surgery or a combination regime. Since the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy remains controversial, current research focuses on developing new anticancer drugs that penetrate the blood-brain barrier in order to prevent and/or treat brain metastases.",Excluded
2153,"Combined treatment for limited small cell lung cancer. Radiation therapy is an important component for the management of limited small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in addition to systemic treatment. The role of surgery is limited for SCLC because of the nature of the disease, which often spreads to regional lymph nodes or spreads distantly. There have been major advances in the treatment of limited-stage SCLC during the past decade because of early application of thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) with concurrent chemotherapy, accelerated TRT, the application of prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients who achieved complete response to concurrent chemotherapy and TRT, and the improvement in supportive care such as discontinuation of tobacco smoking after the diagnosis of SCLC, nutritional support, pain control, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, and adequate antibiotics. It is important to select patients with limited SCLC who are able to tolerate concurrent chemotherapy and accelerated TRT. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2031,"Comparison of tumour age response to radiation for cells derived from tissue culture or solid tumours. Direct comparison of the cell age of 9L and KHT tumour cells derived either from tissue culture or solid tumours was achieved. Cells from dissociated KHT and 9L tumours (the latter implanted either subcutaneously or intracerebrally) and cells from tissue culture were separated into homogenous sized populations by centrifugal elutriation. In both tumour models these homogeneous sized populations correspond to populations enriched at different stages of the cell cycle. The survival of these elutriated cell populations was measured after a single dose of Cs-137 gamma rays. For cells isolated from 9L solid tumours, there was little variation in radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle; however, a very small but significant increase in resistance was found in late G<inf>1</inf> cells. This lack of a large variation in radiosensitivity through the cell cycle for 9L cells from solid tumours also was seen in 9L cells growing in monolayer tissue culture. When similar experiments were performed using the KHT sarcoma tumour model, the results showed that KHT cells in vitro exhibited a fairly conventional increase in radioresistance in both mid G<inf>1</inf> and late S. However, the cell age response of KHT cells from solid tumours was different; particularly in the late S and G<inf>2</inf> + M phases. These data demonstrate that direct extrapolation of in vitro cell age responses to the in situ situation may not always be valid.",Excluded

She had previously been evaluated at an urgent care facility where she was given a course of steroids for her symptoms. Although she had brief improvement with prednisone, her symptoms returned after the course ended. She denied any other systemic symptoms specifically weight loss, fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, or change in bowel habits. She had recently noticed darkening of her urine and possible jaundice, but stated this seemed to be improving. Her physical exam was notable for jaundice without evidence of chronic liver disease. Her abdomen was soft , non-tender, and she had no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation showed AST 166 IU/L, ALT 90 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.4 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase of 401 IU/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse dilation of intrahepatic ducts and a 1.5-cm common bile duct (CBD), as well as 4.8 x 6.7 cm heterogeneous mass in the gallbladder with a second similarly enhancing lesion seen at the distal CBD. The pancreas appeared normal. An ERCP was performed which revealed a polypoid appearing mass within the distal bile duct. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed and this was biopsied after eversion into the duodenal lumen. Initial differential included biliary cystadenoma/ adenocarcinoma versus atypical cholangiocarcinoma versus lymphoma or IPMN of the bile ducts. However, biopsy specimen showed pigmented deposition on H&E stain with subsequent positive staining for S-100 and HMB proteins consistent with melanoma. Unfortunately, a staging MRI of the brain showed evidence of metastatic lesions. Thorough skin, eye, and mucosal examination did not reveal evidence of a primary lesion, and a CT-PET scan showed large, hypermetabolic lesions in the gallbladder and distal bile duct without evidence of other primary source. Therefore, our final diagnosis is primary biliary melanoma with metastatic disease to the brain. Only 10 other cases of primary biliary melanoma have been reported in the literature to date. Mortality is based on stage of disease at presentation with surgical resection providing the best chance for survival. Unfortunately, our patient had metastases present at diagnosis and was not a candidate for surgery. In the 6 months since diagnosis, she has been treated with radiation and Anti-CTLA 4 therapy and is undergoing evaluation for inclusion in clinical trials.",Excluded

However, the parameter has been observed to be significantly correlated to the speed of sound and density. These relationships are analyzed empirically as well as theoretically by developing a pressure-density relation based on a thermodynamic model and the Mie intermolecular potential. The results indicate that for many soft tissues, the coefficient of nonlinearity is largely determined by the isentropic compressibility, kappa<sub>s</sub>.

Research from several sources indicates that young (3 mo) rats exposed to heavy particle irradiation (56Fe irradiation) produces changes in motor behavior as well as alterations in neuronal transmission similar to those seen in aged (22-24 mo) rats. These changes are specific to neuronal systems that are affected by aging. Since 56Fe particles make up approximately 1-2% of cosmic rays, these findings suggest that the neuronal effects of heavy particle irradiation on long-term space flights may be significant, and may even supercede subsequent mutagenic effects in their mission capabilities. It is suggested that among other methods, it may be possible to utilize nutritional modification procedures to offset the putative deleterious effects of these particles in space.",Included
1667,"Nitric oxide transiently converts synaptic inhibition to excitation in retinal amacrine cells. Nitric oxide (NO) is generated by multiple cell types in the vertebrate retina, including amacrine cells. We investigate the role of NO in the modulation of synaptic function using a culture system containing identified retinal amacrine cells. We find that moderate concentrations of NO alter GABA(A) receptor function to produce an enhancement of the GABA-gated current. Higher concentrations of NO also enhance GABA-gated currents, but this enhancement is primarily due to a substantial positive shift in the reversal potential of the current. Several pieces of evidence, including a similar effect on glycine-gated currents, indicate that the positive shift is due to an increase in cytosolic Cl-. This change in the chloride distribution is especially significant because it can invert the sign of GABA- and glycine-gated voltage responses. Furthermore, current- and voltage-clamp recordings from synaptic pairs of GABAergic amacrine cells demonstrate that NO transiently converts signaling at GABAergic synapses from inhibition to excitation. Persistence of the NO-induced shift in E(Cl-) in the absence of extracellular Cl- indicates that the increase in cytosolic Cl- is due to release of Cl- from an internal store. An NO-dependent release of Cl- from an internal store is also demonstrated for rat hippocampal neurons indicating that this mechanism is not restricted to the avian retina. Thus signaling in the CNS can be fundamentally altered by an NO-dependent mobilization of an internal Cl- store.",Excluded
1771,"Detection of misery perfusion with split-dose <sup>123</sup>I-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with carotid occlusive diseases. Background and Purpose - Patients with carotid occlusive disease and stage 2 cerebral hemodynamic failure, characterized by an increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and otherwise known as misery perfusion, have a high risk of cerebral ischemia and subsequent stroke. In clinical practice, the detection of patients with misery perfusion through the use of widely available, noninvasive, and cost-effective modalities such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is extremely important. Methods - We evaluated the relationships between the regional hemodynamic status of cerebral circulation, measured with split-dose [<sup>123</sup>I] N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine SPECT (<sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT) and an acetazolamide challenge, and hemodynamic parameters, including OEF measured with PET, in 27 patients with both unilateral and bilateral carotid occlusive diseases. Results - A significant negative correlation was found between the SPECT-measured cerebrovascular reserve after acetazolamide administration and both the PET-measured OEF and cerebral blood volume. Neither the cerebrovascular reserve nor the cerebral blood flow index, when expressed as a SPECT-measured cerebrum-to-cerebellum ratio, was useful for detecting lesions with an elevated OEF. However, a combination of the cerebrovascular reserve and cerebral blood flow index showed high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the detection of misery perfusion. Conclusions - Our study suggests that split-dose <sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT with an acetazolamide challenge could be useful for screening patients with misery perfusion in carotid occlusive diseases.",Excluded

The effects of ionizing radiation on cell-cycle progression in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and Huntington's disease (HD) patients, and from normal individuals, were studied using DNA flow cytometric analysis. A dose of 100 rad gamma irradiation blocked a proportion of normal and HD cells in G1. A higher radiation dose applied to normal cells increased the number of cells blocked in G1 and significantly delayed cells which were in S at the time of irradiation from reaching G2 DNA content. The reduced cumulative mitotic index in irradiated cultures of normal cells 2 h after irradiation suggests that cells in G2 at the time of irradiation are delayed before entering mitosis. After irradiation HD cells responded similarly to normal cells except that a greater proportion of HD cells were blocked in G1. AT cells do not show the normal delay in progression from G1 to S, or from S to G2 in the first cycle after irradiation. The cumulative mitotic index was reduced in irradiated cells, implying that they are delayed in G2. Thus AT cells did not recognize or respond to signals from damaged DNA which in normal and HD cells caused a proportional block in G1 and an S-phase delay. The only point of arrest in cell-cycle progression in irradiated AT cells was in G2.",Excluded
1922,"Acute abdominal pain: is there a potential role for MRI in the setting of the emergency department in a patient with renal calculi?. Acute flank pain is a frequent clinical presentation encountered in emergency departments, and a work-up for obstructive urolithiasis in this setting is a common indication for computed tomography (CT). However, imaging alternatives to CT for the evaluation of renal colic are warranted in some clinical situations, such as younger patients, pregnancy, patients that have undergone multiple prior CT exams and also patients with vague clinical presentations. MRI, although relatively insensitive for the direct detection of urinary calculi, has the ability to detect the secondary effects of obstructive urolithiasis. Using rapid, single shot T2-weighted sequences without and with fat saturation provides an abdominopelvic MR examination that can detect the sequelae of clinically active stone disease, in addition to alternate inflammatory processes that may mimic the symptoms of renal colic. In addition, MR nephro-urography (MRNU) has the ability to provide quantitative analysis of renal function that has the potential to direct clinical management in the setting of obstructing calculi.

PURPOSE: Splenomegaly occurs frequently in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), indicating significant splenic metaplasia. Symptomatic radiation therapy can be delivered, but the best irradiation scheme is still unknown. Results of splenic irradiation in patients with myelofibrosis or chronic leukemia were retrospectively analyzed.PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 24 patients: 15 presented with MF and 9 with CML. Median irradiation doses were 9.8 and 7.7 Gy, respectively. The hematologic toxicity was moderate (except for platelets in the acute phase of the disease).RESULTS: No toxicity was observed. Various factors predictive of the response to radiation therapy are described. While high (around 14 Gy) radiation therapy dose appears necessary for MF and should be started before the increase in transfusion need, huge splenomegalies should be excluded in regard to CML. As for other cases, the optimal dose is still unclear, but should probably be high enough, ie, around 10 Gy.CONCLUSION: To further study and better understand biological mechanisms underlying response to radiotherapy in patients with MF, prospective radio-chemotherapy phase II trials should be conducted in both CML and MF patients.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To determine the effects of sequential versus concurrent administration of cranial radiotherapy and cisplatin/carmustine (BCNU) chemotherapy on survival and toxicity in newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytomas.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1988 to 1996, 101 patients were treated on 2 therapeutic protocols for malignant glioma that used the identical chemotherapy regimen but differed in the timing of cranial radiotherapy. The eligibility criteria for the 2 protocols were identical. In the first protocol (1988-1991, 52 patients), cisplatin 120 mg/BCNU 120 mg i.v. over 72 h, was given for 3 monthly cycles prior to cranial radiotherapy. After a response rate of 42%, with a median survival of 13 months was achieved with this sequential regimen, a successor protocol (1992-1996, 49 patients) was developed in which cranial radiotherapy began concurrently with the start of the identical chemotherapy regimen. Chemotherapy was delayed but not discontinued if prolonged grade III/IV hematologic toxicity was experienced, but protocol therapy was discontinued if disease progression or thromboembolic events occurred. Survival outcome and hematologic toxicity were compared for the patients treated on these protocols.RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of sequentially-treated patients and 68% of concurrently-treated patients completed all planned therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival was similar to concurrent or sequential administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (median 12.8 months vs. 13.8 months, respectively). Hematologic toxicity was significantly less in sequentially- versus concurrently-treated patients, with median nadir per cycle (2.9 vs. 1.8 x 10(3)/mm3) (p < 0.001), and incidence of grade 3/4 leukopenia 40% versus 77% (p = 0.002). There was also an increase in platelet transfusion requirements in concurrently-treated patients, but no significant worsening of anemia. We postulate that the worsened leukopenia results from the effects of concurrent radiotherapy on circulating stem cells.CONCLUSION: Concurrent radiotherapy with this regimen of cisplatin and BCNU chemotherapy did not improve survival, but did increase hematologic toxicity. Therefore, we do not recommend further testing of the concurrent regimen, whereas the sequential regimen is currently under evaluation in a Phase III trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the Southwest Oncology Group. In addition, these studies demonstrate that relatively small radiotherapy fields can deliver a dose to circulating stem cells sufficient to worsen the hematologic toxicity of concurrent myelosuppressive chemotherapy, a phenomena which should be considered in the design of combined modality protocols for other body sites.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Radiopeptide therapy using a somatostatin analogue labelled with a beta emitter such as (90)Y/(177)Lu-DOTATOC is a new therapeutic option in neuroendocrine cancer. Alternative treatments for patients with refractory disease are rare. Here we report the first-in-human experience with (213)Bi-DOTATOC targeted alpha therapy (TAT) in patients pretreated with beta emitters.METHODS: Seven patients with progressive advanced neuroendocrine liver metastases refractory to treatment with (90)Y/(177)Lu-DOTATOC were treated with an intraarterial infusion of (213)Bi-DOTATOC, and one patient with bone marrow carcinosis was treated with a systemic infusion of (213)Bi-DOTATOC. Haematological, kidney and endocrine toxicities were assessed according to CTCAE criteria. Radiological response was assessed with contrast-enhanced MRI and (68)Ga-DOTATOC-PET/CT.

Acute haematotoxicity was even less pronounced than with the preceding beta therapies.CONCLUSION: TAT can induce remission of tumours refractory to beta radiation with favourable acute and mid-term toxicity at therapeutic effective doses.",Excluded
1308,"Zebrafish as a ""biosensor""? Effects of ionizing radiation and amifostine on embryonic viability and development. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a popular vertebrate model system for cancer and treatment-related research. Benefits include ease of care, rapid development, optical clarity of embryos, which allows visualization of major organ systems, and opportunities for genetic manipulation. However, specific parameters of radiation sensitivity have not been systematically documented. We investigated the effects of radiation and a radiomodifier on zebrafish viability and embryonic development. Embryos were exposed to gamma-radiation (5, 10, or 20 Gy) at sequential times postfertilization and serially assessed for viability and morphologic abnormalities. As expected, lethality and morphologic perturbations were more pronounced earlier in embryogenesis and with higher radiation doses and were partially reversed by amifostine. The effects of radiation and concurrent treatment with amifostine on the developmental organization of the eye and brain were striking. Radiation resulted in hypocellularity and disorganization of the cellular layers of the retina, effects partially reversed by amifostine, as well as lens opacification. Radiation strikingly reduced the volume of brain, but the volume loss was substantially blocked by amifostine. Increased terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling signal was noted in both the irradiated eye and brain, but reduced by amifostine. Finally, irradiating embryos resulted in caspase activation detectable in 96-well microplates, which was proportional to the number of embryos and radiation dose; the degree of activation was markedly reduced by amifostine. These results together suggest the power and versatility of the zebrafish in assessing the effects of radiation and radiomodifiers on organ and tissue development.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Papillary endothelial hyperplasia (PEH) is a rare form of exuberant reactive endothelial proliferation that can mimic neoplasm. We report the largest series of patients with histologically confirmed intracranial extravascular PEH developing in the field of previous treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery.CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We collected the clinical, radiological, surgical, and pathological findings from 4 patients in whom intracranial extravascular PEH developed after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery. In all patients, the development of an enlarging hemorrhagic mass lesion at the site of previous radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging was radiographically suspicious for neoplasm and prompted biopsy or resection. All 4 patients elected to undergo biopsy or surgical resection. Histological examination of the biopsy and resection specimens in all patients demonstrated the classic features of PEH.CONCLUSION: The interval to the development of PEH ranged from 5 months to 6 years, 10 months. Clinical follow-up was available for 3 of the 4 patients. None of these 3 patients have demonstrated evidence of recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 22 months (range, 15-30 months). These patients share common radiological features, potentially allowing preoperative diagnosis and improved guidance of clinical management. These cases suggest a link between radiosurgery and the development of PEH. These findings also suggest that PEH should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients treated with radiosurgery in whom a hemorrhagic mass lesion subsequently develops at or near the site of previous treatment.

In hospitalized patients, mastoid effusion increases the risks for bacterial otitis and mastoiditis. We reasoned that cephalad fluid shifts during strict -6degree head down tilt bed rest could reproduce space-flight associated mastoid effusion and that artificial gravity may reverse the response.METHODS: The recent Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study-European Space Agency study (AGBRESA) tested influences of artificial gravity during 60 days head down bed rest on a short-arm human centrifuge in healthy participants. The two intervention groups received daily artificial gravity with 30 minutes continuous artificial gravity or intermittent artificial gravity. A third group served as a control group and received no artificial gravity. We assessed cranial magnetic resonance images for mastoid effusions 1 day before bed rest, at days 14 and 52 of bed rest, and 3 days after bed rest.RESULTS: None of the participants exhibited mastoid effusions before bed rest. Six participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 14 (4 continuous, 2 intermittent, 0 control). Fifteen participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 52 and 3 days after bed rest (7 continuous, 3 intermittent, 5 control).CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid effusions commonly occur during strict head down tilt bed rest. The model can be applied to study the mechanisms and potential countermeasures for space flight-associated mastoid effusions. Formation of mastoid effusions during head down tilt bed rest is not prevented by daily 30 minutes short-arm intermittent or continuous centrifugation.",Excluded

1863,"Focused ultrasound enhanced intranasal delivery of brain derived neurotrophic factor produces neurorestorative effects in a Parkinson's disease mouse model. Focused ultrasound-enhanced intranasal (IN + FUS) delivery is a noninvasive approach that utilizes the olfactory pathway to administer pharmacological agents directly to the brain, allowing for a more homogenous distribution in targeted locations compared to IN delivery alone. However, whether such a strategy has therapeutic values, especially in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), remains to be established. Herein, we evaluated whether the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine catalysis, could be enhanced by IN + FUS delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a toxin-based PD mouse model. Mice were put on the subacute dosing regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), producing bilateral degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway consistent with early-stage PD. MPTP mice then received BDNF intranasally followed by multiple unilateral FUS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings in the left basal ganglia for three consecutive weeks. Subsequently, mice were survived for two months and were evaluated morphologically and behaviorally to determine the integrity of their nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Mice receiving IN + FUS had significantly increased TH immunoreactivity in the treated hemisphere compared to the untreated hemisphere while mice receiving only FUS-induced BBB opening or no treatment at all did not show any differences. Additionally, behavioral changes were only observed in the IN + FUS treated mice, indicating improved motor control function in the treated hemisphere. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the method and potential of IN + FUS for the delivery of bioactive factors for treatment of neurodegenerative disorder.",Excluded

Background: Adjuvant therapy for melanoma has centered on high dose interferon for now almost 20 years. Recently, the FDA approved ipilimumab dosed at 10 mg/kg (10/kg ipi) for use in high risk resected melanoma. Though these two treatment options are available they still have limits in terms of efficacy with approximately 1 year of relapse free survival benefit (HDI and 10/kg ipi) and a modest overall survival benefit (HDI).

The second was a recently summarized data on the distributions of 11562 spontaneous, radiation- and chemical-induced forward mutations in the ad-3 region of heterokaryon 12 of Neurospora crassa. They were analyzed as large two-way contingency tables (CTs) where two kinds of profiles were compared: site (or genotypic class) profiles and origin (or mutagen) profiles. To measure similarity (homogeneity) between any pair of profiles, the relevant sufficient statistics, Kastenbaum-Hirotsu squared distance (KHi<sup>2</sup>), was used. Collapsing the similar profiles into distinct internally homogeneous clusters named 'collapsets' revealed their similarity pattern. To facilitate the procedure, the computer program, COLLAPSE, was elaborated.

In the ad-3 data set, five collapsets were revealed among origin profiles (OPs): (I) ENU=4NQO=4HAQO=FANFT=SQ18506; (II) AF-2=EI=MMS=DEP; (III) ETO=UV; (IV) AHA=PROCARB; and (V) He ions=protons. Moreover, the previous observation that MDs are dose-dependent was confirmed for X-ray-induced MDs. Profiles induced with the low doses of X-rays are similar to that induced with <sup>85</sup>Sr, and profiles induced with the medium X-ray doses to those induced with protons and He ions. Evaluated similarities appear to be rather reasonable: mutagens with similar mode of action induce similar MDs. Similarity pattern revealed among genotypic class profiles (GCPs) seems to be also interpretable. When supplemented with descriptive cluster analysis, SPAN appears to be a fruitful methodology in MS analysis. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
1892,"Restricting exposure to pulsed and broadband magnetic fields. A general procedure is described for application of the new ICNIRP exposure guidelines to pulsed and broadband magnetic fields below 100 kHz. The procedure involves weighting of the spectral components with a function that takes into account the basic restrictions and reference levels. A simple first-order RC response or its piecewise linear equivalent is proposed for the weighting function. The weighting can be performed either on the Fourier transformed sample of the measured signal or in real time by processing the signal with an analog or digital filter circuit. The cut-off frequency of the filter is 820 Hz. The occupational exposure criteria are exceeded when the weighted peak magnetic flux density exceeds 43 microT or equivalently the weighted peak dB/dt exceeds 0.22 T s(-1). The maximal peak exposures allowed by the proposed approach are compared with the stimulation thresholds computed with a stimulation model. The results strongly suggest that the safety margin to the stimulation is greater for non-sinusoidal than for sinusoidal waveforms, and at low frequencies it is higher than at high frequencies. The increase of the low-frequency safety margin is desirable to avoid magnetophosphenes and possible CNS effects that may occur below the level predicted by the classical nerve models. Measurement techniques and examples of measured magnetic fields are presented. Particularly high exposures were measured inside MRI equipment and anti-theft gates.",Excluded
1979,"Spatial buffering of light-evoked potassium increases by retinal Muller (glial) cells. Activity-dependent variations in extracellular potassium concentration in the central nervous system may be regulated, in part, by potassium spatial buffering currents in glial cells. The role of spatial buffering in the retina was assessed by measuring light-evoked potassium changes in amphibian eyecups. The amplitude of potassium increases in the vitreous humor was reduced to approximately 10 percent by 50 micromolar barium, while potassium increases in the inner plexiform layer were largely unchanged. The decrease in the vitreal potassium response was accurately simulated with a numerical model of potassium current flow through Muller cells, the principal glial cells of the retina. Barium also substantially increased the input resistance of Muller cells and blocked the Muller cell-generated M-wave, indicating that barium blocks the potassium channels of Muller cells. Thus, after a light-evoked potassium increase within the retina, there is a substantial transfer of potassium from the retina to the vitreous humor by potassium current flow through Muller cells.",Excluded
1957,"Repetitive endoscopic laser treatments for palliation of lung malignancies. Endobronchial laser therapy is generally safe and well tolerated. Because the laser is a form of nonionizing radiation, therapy can be repeated as often as needed. Two male patients, 50 and 55 years old, were referred to our clinic because of severe dyspnea and massive hemoptysis, the first 3 years ago and the second 1.5 years ago. In his medical history, the former patient had a thoracotomy for thymoma resection 5 years ago. Rigid bronchoscopy was performed under general anesthesia, Nd:YAP (neodymium-yttrium, aluminum, pevroskite) laser resection and silicon stent insertion were carried out for an endobronchial mass that was almost completely obliterating the left main bronchus. During the next 2 years, the same procedure was repeated 6 times to prevent distal tracheal obliteration. The left lung has now been totally collapsed for 2 years and the patient is still alive and healthy. The latter was a patient with a centrally located nonsmall cell lung cancer invading the middle and lower trachea, right main and upper lobe bronchi causing near-total obstruction. Rigid bronchoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. Nd:YAP laser coagulation and mechanical resection were carried out and a Dumon ""Y"" stent was inserted. In 1.5 years, therapeutic bronchoscopy was repeated 6 times. The patient is alive without dyspnea or respiratory insufficiency, although with brain metastases. Endoscopic laser resection of lung malignancies is rapid, effective, repeatable, and complementary to other treatments; although it should be considered only palliative, it could be curative in benign lesions and early cancers.",Excluded

Rabbit hypothalamic slices prelabelled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-noradrenaline and superfused with Krebs solution were stimulated electrically at a frequency of 5 Hz. Exposure to verapamil (0.1 to 10 muM) significantly increased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the electrically-evoked overflow of tritium, without affecting the spontaneous outflow of radioactivity. Exposure to diltiazem in concentrations up to 100 muM had no effect on the electrically evoked release of [<sup>3</sup>H]-noradrenaline, but increased the basal outflow of radioactivity at 10 and 100 muM. The preferential alpha<inf>2</inf>-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.1 muM) significantly antagonized the inhibitory effect of clonidine or adrenaline on [<sup>3</sup>H]-noradrenaline overflow elicited by electrical stimulation. Verapamil (3 muM) also antagonized this inhibitory effect of the alpha<inf>2</inf>-adrenoceptor agonists on [<sup>3</sup>H]-noradrenaline release. In contrast to these results, exposure to diltiazem (10 muM) was ineffective in blocking the action of te alpha<inf>2</inf>-adrenoceptor agonist.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of chordoma treatment with CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) stereotactic radiosurgery (CK/SRS).METHODS: Eighteen patients with chordoma were treated with CK/SRS as a primary adjuvant (17 patients) or the only treatment (1 patient). The series included 24 lesions (28 treatments). The median age of the patients was 60 years (range, 24-85 years). Forty-four percent of the tumors were located in the mobile spine, 39% inside the cranium, and 17% in the sacral region. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1. The mean tumor volume was 128.0 mL (range, 12.0-457.3 mL), and the median dose of 35 Gy (range, 24.0-40.0 Gy) was delivered in 5 sessions. The median follow-up period was 46 months (range, 7-65 months).RESULTS: There were 3 significant complications in patients with previous irradiation, including infection in the surgical/radiation site (2 patients) and decreased vision (1 patient). Improvement in pain and quality of life did not reach statistical significance (alpha = 0.05). Seven patients experienced recurrence at a median of 10 months (range, 5-38 months), and 4 patients with disseminated disease died 7 to 48 months after therapy. Two patients had a partial response, whereas 9 others had stable disease. The local control rate at 65 months was 59.1%, with an overall survival of 74.3% and disease-specific survival of 88.9%. We estimated an alpha/beta ratio of 2.45 for chordomas, which supports hypofractionation.CONCLUSION: The CK/SRS safety and efficacy profile compares favorably with those of other treatment delivery systems. CK/SRS appears to reduce tumor volume, given an adequate dose. The authors recommend treatment with 40 Gy in 5 sessions to the clinical treatment volume, which includes the gross tumor volume and at least a 1-cm margin.",Excluded
1438,"Combination of pGL1-TNF-alpha gene and radiation (proton and gamma-ray) therapy against brain tumor. The major goal of this study was to determine if treatment with the newly constructed plasmid vector for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (pGL1-TNF-alpha) could enhance the radiation-induced growth reduction of C6 rat glioma. In addition, two different forms of ionizing radiation (gamma-rays and protons) were utilized. Body and spleen mass, leukocyte blastogenesis, and flow cytometry analysis of cell populations in blood and spleen were performed to detect toxicity, if any, and to identify mechanisms that may correlate with the anti-tumor action of combination therapy. C6 tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice and allowed to become established before treatment initiation. pGL1-TNF-alpha was injected into the implanted tumors, which were then irradiated 16-18 hr later; each modality was administered three times over 8-9 days. The addition of pGL1-TNF-alpha significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of radiation (p < 0.05). The effect was more than additive, since pGL1-TNF-alpha alone did not slow tumor progression and radiation alone had only a modest effect. Administration of pGL1-TNF-alpha together with proton radiation resulted in tumor volumes that were 23% smaller than those following pGL1-TNF-alpha + gamma-ray treatment; a similar differential in tumor size was observed in the groups receiving only radiation. Body weights and blood and spleen cell analyses did not reveal treatment-related toxicity. High basal proliferation of blood leukocytes and increased B cell levels in the spleen were associated with pGL1-TNF-alpha + 60Co (gamma-radiation) or proton treatment. Overall, the results suggest that the pGL1-TNF-alpha/radiation combination is effective and safe under the conditions employed. This is the first study to combine gene and proton radiation therapy and to show, under controlled experimental conditions, that proton radiation may have a greater effect against malignant tumors compared to the same physical dose of gamma-radiation.",Excluded
2060,"Intraventricular glioblastoma-A rare localization of a common intracerebral tumor. Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents approx. 25% of all intracranial tumors in adults and is the most common primary brain tumor. In two thirds of cases, is the frontotemporal region affected, although this tumor can occur anywhere in the central nervous system. The intraventricular region as primary localization is extremely rare and only 29 cases have been reported, so far. Surgical gross total resection with concomitant radiation and chemotherapy is the standard therapy for best survival. Methods We report on six cases of histologically confirmed intraventricular GBM's who underwent biopsy or subtotal tumor resection at our department and were admitted between December 2015 and May 2016. Results All six cases with intraventricular mass underwent at least tumor biopsy to confirm the histology of GBM. The mean age was 58.2 +/- 15.7 years, the youngest patient was 26 years old. In terms of gender, there were 4 males and 2 females involved. The main clinical manifestations were neuropsychological deficits with personality changes, memory disorders and fatigue. Three patients presented with paresis, and one was symptomatic with headache and diffuse body pain. One patient presented with a fulminant loss of consciousness and was treated on the ICU for several days with an EVD. Four patients underwent biopsy only and two patients underwent craniotomy and subtotal tumor resection. All lesions were localized in the body of the lateral ventricle, in one case in the anterior horn, in another case in the central part of the lateral ventricle and in two cases in the posterior horn and the trigone. In the remaining two cases the tumor was found in the body of the inferior horn. The 2 patients who underwent surgery had the GBM localized in the posterior and the inferior horn and a parietooccipital approach over the trigone was used. Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy followed in 4 patients. Conclusion Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary brain tumor, but the intraventricular localization is very rare and has a rather poor prognosis due to the fact, that gross total resection mostly can not be achieved. Surgical removal might be attempted only if subtotal resection can be achieved.",Excluded

Background: The phase III ALEX study in patients with treatment-naive advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutation-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) met its primary end point of improved progression-free survival (PFS) with alectinib versus crizotinib. Here, we present detailed central nervous system (CNS) efficacy data from ALEX.Patients and methods: Overall, 303 patients aged >=18 years underwent 1:1 randomization to receive twice-daily doses of alectinib 600 mg or crizotinib 250 mg. Brain imaging was conducted in all patients at baseline and every subsequent 8 weeks. End points (analyzed by subgroup: patients with/without baseline CNS metastases; patients with/without prior radiotherapy) included PFS, CNS objective response rate (ORR), and time to CNS progression.Results: In total, 122 patients had Independent Review Committee-assessed baseline CNS metastases (alectinib, n = 64; crizotinib, n = 58), 43 had measurable lesions (alectinib, n = 21; crizotinib, n = 22), and 46 had received prior radiotherapy (alectinib, n = 25; crizotinib, n = 21). Investigator-assessed PFS with alectinib was consistent between patients with baseline CNS metastases [hazard ratio (HR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.64] and those without (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33-0.80, P interaction = 0.36). Similar results were seen in patients regardless of prior radiotherapy. Time to CNS progression was significantly longer with alectinib versus crizotinib and comparable between patients with and without baseline CNS metastases (P < 0.0001). CNS ORR was 85.7% with alectinib versus 71.4% with crizotinib in patients who received prior radiotherapy and 78.6% versus 40.0%, respectively, in those who had not.Conclusion: Alectinib demonstrated superior CNS activity and significantly delayed CNS progression versus crizotinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced ALK+ NSCLC, irrespective of prior CNS disease or radiotherapy.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02075840.",Excluded

1520,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent malignant gliomas. Purpose: To evaluate the role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of recurrent malignant gliomas. Patients and Methods: We treated 35 patients with large (median treatment volume, 28 cm<sup>3</sup>) recurrent tumors that had failed to respond to conventional treatment. Twenty-six patients (74%) had glioblastomas multiforme (GBM) and nine (26%) had anaplastic astrocytomas (AA). Result(s): The mean time from diagnosis to radiosurgery was 10 months (range, 1 to 36), from radiosurgery to death, 8.0 months (range, 1 to 23). Twenty-one GBM (81%) and six AA (67%) patients have died. The actuarial survival time for all patients was 21 months from diagnosis and 8 months from radiosurgery. Twenty-two of 26 patients (85%) died of local or marginal failure, three (12%) of noncontiguous failure, and one (4%) of CSF dissemination. Age (P = .0405) was associated with improved survival on multivariate analysis, and age (P = .0110) and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (P = .0285) on univariate analysis. Histology, treatment volume, and treatment dose were not significant variables by univariate analysis. Seven patients required surgical resection for increasing mass effect a mean of 4.0 months after radiosurgery, for an actuarial reoperation rate of 31%. Surgery did not significantly influence survival. At surgery, four patients had recurrent tumor, two had radiation necrosis, and one had both tumor and necrosis. The actuarial necrosis rate was 14% and the pathologic findings could have been predicted by the integrated logistic formula for developing symptomatic brain injury. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery appears to proofing survival for recurrent malignant gliomas and has a lower reoperative rate for symptomatic necrosis than does brachytherapy. Patterns of failure are similar for both of these techniques.",Excluded

1221,"Co-aggregation of ganglioside-containing membranes and alpha-synuclein. Parkinson's disease (PD) is accompanied by the formation of Lewy bodies, whose main components are fibrils of the protein alpha-synuclein. These aggregates include membrane lipids, while little is known about the process of lipid/alpha- synuclein co-aggregation and its implications for fibril and Lewy body formation. Ganglioside lipids are abundant in neuronal membranes and have been found to accelerate fibril formation [1] and to accumulate in PD brains. We address the effects of ganglioside-phospholipid (GM3-POPC) model membranes on the dynamics (regarding the order parameter and the correlation time of C-H bond reorientation) and structure of co-aggregates with alpha-synuclein using polarization-transfer 13C solid-state NMR [2], wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) and cryogenic electron microscopy. 31P NMR powder patterns were recorded to monitor the lipid phase behavior and the spinning sidebands at 1250 Hz MAS were used to fit the chemical shift anisotropy before and after coaggregation. It was found that both lipids are co-assembled with alpha-synuclein with reduced headgroup and acyl chain mobility, and that the mobility of alpha-synuclein is modulated by the lipid-to-protein ratio and membrane composition. As the ganglioside content of membranes was increased the mobility of alanine residues is affected, implying a modulation of the fibril core which could impact the fibrillation propensity. These effects of co-aggregation on alpha-synuclein fibril mobility are currently being further investigated by us and raises questions on the specific lipid-protein interactions and the organization of lipids inside coaggregates.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) reflectance is often used in optical methods for RNFL assessment in clinical diagnosis of glaucoma, yet little is known about the reflectance property of the RNFL under the development of glaucoma. This study measured the changes in RNFL reflectance spectra that occurred in retinal nerve fiber bundles with different degrees of glaucomatous damage.METHODS: A rat model of glaucoma with laser photocoagulation of trabecular meshwork was used. Reflectance of the RNFL in an isolated retina was measured at wavelengths of 400-830 nm. Cytostructural distribution of the bundles measured optically was evaluated by confocal imaging of immunohistochemistry staining of cytoskeletal components, F-actin, microtubules, and neurofilaments. RNFL reflectance spectra were studied in bundles with normal-looking appearance, early F-actin distortion, and apparent damage of all cytoskeletal components. Changes of RNFL reflectance spectra were studied at different radii (0.22, 0.33, and 0.44 mm) from the optic nerve head (ONH).RESULTS: Bundles in 30 control retinas and 41 glaucomatous retinas were examined. In normal retinas, reflectance spectra were similar along the same bundles. In glaucomatous retinas, reflectance spectra changed along bundles with the spectra becoming flatter as bundle areas approached the ONH.CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) causes nonuniform changes in RNFL reflectance across wavelengths. Changes of reflectance spectra occur early in bundles near the ONH and prior to apparent cytoskeletal distortion. Using the ratio of RNFL reflectance measured at different wavelengths can provide early and sensitive detection of glaucomatous damage.",Excluded

Objectives: Peptide receptor-targeted radionuclide therapy (PRRT) targeting somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) has emerged as a promising therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. Beta-particle PRRT using <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-tyr -octreotate ( <sup>11</sup>Lu- DOTATATE) has been shown to significantly improve progression-free survival for NET patients compared to the standard of care treatment in a Phase 3 trial (1). However, the overall response rate is limited and complete responses are rare. Emerging evidence suggests that alpha-particle PRRT (alpha-PRRT) has the potential to improve tumor response. However, concerns regarding potential toxicities to normal organs and tissues (e.g., kidneys, bone marrow) mandate development and evaluation of personalized dosimetric approaches which can be used in clinical studies to reduce these toxicities. In this study, we evaluated potential renal and bone marrow toxicities arising from <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTA-tyr -octreotide ( <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC) in an animal model. A dosimetry study was performed on each animal with the aim of examining the relationship between localized <sup>212</sup>Pb alpha+beta dose to kidneys (a dose-limiting organ for beta PRRT) and markers of kidney function, injury, and kidney morphological changes. Method(s): 14.8 MBq of <sup>203</sup>Pb-DOTATOC was administered to tumor-free CD1-Elite (SOPF) mice via tail vein and SPECT/CT images were obtained at 1.5 h and 22 h post-injection. After 1.5 weeks, the same group of mice (8 mice) was divided into 4 groups, and each group was injected with escalating activities of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC (0.037, 0.074, 0.118, and 0.178 MBq/g). The absorbed dose (alpha/beta) from <sup>212</sup>P b - DOTATOC was estimated by the OLINDA/EXM software based on the time-activity curves obtained from <sup>203</sup>Pb-DOTATOC SPECT/CT images. The renal mass of each mouse used in this calculation was obtained from the CT-delineated volume with an assumed density of 1.05 g/cm<sup>2</sup> . In order to assess acute and chronic kidney injury by the radiotherapeutic, blood or urine were collected at day 1, day 3, week 3, week 12, and 7 months post-injection for analysis of nephrotoxicity parameters NGal (Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and Cystatin C. Another group of four mice was injected with the highest dose (0.178 MBq/g), and hematological toxicity was evaluated by serial complete blood counts (up to 5 weeks). Result(s): Escalated activities of Pb-DOTATOC resulted in increased estimated alpha doses in kidneys (6.6 Gy to 35.2 Gy). Contributions of beta particles were minimal compared to the alpha particles accounting for less than 4% of the total absorbed dose. We found evidence for mild acute renal tubular toxicity based on measures of serum NGAL levels in 6 of the 8 treated mice, although the elevated levels appeared to show no relationship to the kidney doses in this study. There was no evidence of changes in renal function in this group when evaluated by continued normal levels of serum Cystatin C out to 12 weeks post administration of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC. We observed a 50% average decline in platelets and 40% average decline in WBC 2-3 weeks following administration of 0.178 MBq/g of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC in mice. These nadir values returned to baseline levels at 5 weeks post administration.

1476,"Mobile computerized tomography scanning in the neurosurgery intensive care unit: Increase in patient safety and reduction of staff workload. Object. Transportation of unstable neurosurgical patients involves risks that may lead to further deterioration and secondary brain injury from perturbations in physiological parameters. Mobile computerized tomography (CT) head scanning in the neurosurgery intensive care (NICU) is a new technique that minimizes the need to transport unstable patients. The authors have been using this device since June 1997 and have developed their own method of scanning such patients. Methods. The scanning procedure and radiation safety measures are described. The complications that occurred in 89 patients during transportation and conventional head CT scanning at the Department of Radiology were studied prospectively. These complications were compared with the ones that occurred during mobile CT scanning in 50 patients in the NICU. The duration of the procedures was recorded, and an estimation of the staff workload was made. Two patient groups, defined as high- and medium-risk cases, were studied. Medical and/or technical complications occurred during conventional CT scanning in 25% and 20% of the patients in the high- and medium-risk groups, respectively. During mobile CT scanning complications occurred in 4.3% of the high-risk group and 0% of the medium-risk group. Mobile CT scanning also took significantly less time, and the estimated personnel cost was reduced. Conclusions. Mobile CT scanning in the NICU is safe. It minimizes the risk of physiological deterioration and technical mishaps linked to intrahospital transport, which may aggravate secondary brain injury. The time that patients have to remain outside the controlled environment of the NICU is minimized, and the staff's workload is decreased.",Excluded

1477,"H2O2-Sensitive Isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1 Act in Bitter-Sensing Gustatory Neurons to Promote Avoidance of UV During Egg-Laying. The evolutionarily conserved TRPA1 channel can sense various stimuli including temperatures and chemical irritants. Recent results have suggested that specific isoforms of Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1) are UV-sensitive and that their UV sensitivity is due to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. However, whether such UV sensitivity served any physiological purposes in animal behavior was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms promote avoidance of UV when adult Drosophila females are selecting sites for egg-laying. First, we show that blind/visionless females are still capable of sensing and avoiding UV during egg-laying when intensity of UV is high yet within the range of natural sunlight. Second, we show that such vision-independent UV avoidance is mediated by a group of bitter-sensing neurons on the proboscis that express H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms. We show that these bitter-sensing neurons exhibit dTRPA1-dependent UV sensitivity. Importantly, inhibiting activities of these bitter-sensing neurons, reducing their dTRPA1 expression, or reducing their H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity all significantly reduced blind females' UV avoidance, whereas selectively restoring a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive isoform of dTRPA1 in these neurons restored UV avoidance. Lastly, we show that specifically expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson in these bitter-sensing neurons promotes egg-laying avoidance of red light, an otherwise neutral cue for egg-laying females. Together, these results demonstrate a physiological role of the UV-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms, reveal that adult Drosophila possess at least two sensory systems for detecting UV, and uncover an unexpected role of bitter-sensing taste neurons in UV sensing.",Excluded

1458,"Isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage in mild traumatic brain injury: is a repeat CT scan necessary? A single-institution retrospective study. BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage (iSAH) is a common finding in the emergency department. In many centers, a repeat CT scan is routinely performed 24 to72 h following the trauma to rule out further radiological progression. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical utility of the repeat CT scan in clinical practice.METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of all patients who presented to our institution with mild TBI (mTBI) and isolated SAH between January 2015 and October 2017. CT scan at admission and control after 24 to 72 h were examined for each patient in order to detect any possible change. Neurological deterioration, antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy, coagulopathy, SAH location, associated injuries, and length of stay in hospital were analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 649 TBI patients, 106 patients met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-four patients were females and 52 were males with a mean age of 68.2 years. Radiological iSAH progression was found in 2 of 106 (1.89) patients, and one of them was under antiplatelet therapy. No neurological deterioration was observed. Ten of 106 (9.4%) patients were under anticoagulation therapy, and 28 of 106 (26.4%) were under antiplatelet therapy.CONCLUSION: ISAH in mTBI seems to be a radiological stable entity over 72 h with no neurological deterioration. The clinical utility of a repeat head CT in such patients is questionable, considering its radiation exposure and cost. Regardless of anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy, neurologic observation and symptomatic treatment solely could be a reasonable alternative.",Excluded

The core of the model used a tiled convolutional neural network that analyzed frequency-domain spectra to detect artifacts.RESULTS: When compared with a panel of MRS experts, our convolutional neural network achieved high sensitivity and specificity with an area under the curve of 0.95. A visualization scheme was implemented to better understand how the convolutional neural network made its judgement on single-voxel or multivoxel MRSI, and the convolutional neural network was embedded into a pipeline capable of producing whole-brain spectroscopic MRI volumes in real time.CONCLUSION: The fully automated method for assessment of spectral quality provides a valuable tool to support clinical MRSI or spectroscopic MRI studies for use in fields such as adaptive radiation therapy planning.",Excluded
1809,"Glioma-specific cytotoxic T cells can be effectively induced by subcutaneous vaccination of irradiated wild-type tumor cells without artificial cytokine production. Effective induction of systemic antitumor immunity is a crucial step for success of immune gene therapy for intracerebral gliomas. We examined in this study the ability to induce glioma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) by subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization of irradiated whole-tumor cell vaccine with or without artificial cytokine production, and also examined in vivo efficacy of the induced CTL against a rat brain tumor model with 9L gliosarcoma cells. Murine neuroblastoma C1300 cells transduced with the interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene (C1300/IL-2, C1300/IL-4 or C1300/GM-CSF) were used as cytokine-producers. Glioma-specific CTL activity was equivalently induced in the rats vaccinated s.c. with irradiated 9L, irradiated IL-2-producing 9L cells or the mixed population of irradiated 9L and C1300/IL-2 cells, while the activity was relatively lower in the rats vaccinated with irradiated 9L cells mixed with either C1300/IL-4 or C1300/GM-CSF cells. In the rats immunized s.c. with irradiated 9L cells, intracerebral (i.c.) 9L tumors implanted together with either C1300/IL-2 or C1300/IL-4 were completely rejected. Pre-established brain tumor also could be eliminated by the s.c. immunization of irradiated 9L cells and i.c. transplantation of IL-2-producers. These results suggest that glioma-specific CTLs could be effectively induced by s.c. immunization of irradiated wild-type tumor cells without artificial cytokine production.",Excluded

2006,"Rational design of nanosystems for simultaneous drug delivery and photodynamic therapy by quantum mechanical modeling. Drug delivery systems are based on reversible interactions between carriers and drugs. Spacers are often introduced to tailor the type of interaction and to keep drugs intact. Here, we model a drug delivery system based on a functionalized curved TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle of realistic size (700 atoms - 2.2 nm) by the neurotransmitter dopamine to carry the anticancer chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX). The multiscale quantum chemical study aims at unraveling the nature and mechanism of the interactions between the components and the electronic properties of the composite system. We simulate the temperature effect through molecular dynamics runs of thermal annealing. Dopamine binds preferentially to low coordinated Ti sites on the nanoparticle through dissociated bidentate and chelate modes involving the diol groups. DOX is tethered by H-bonds, pi-pi stacking, dipole-dipole interactions and dispersion forces. Comparing different coverage densities of the spacer on the nanoparticle surface, we assess the best conditions for an effective drug transport and release: only at full coverage, DOX does not slip among the dopamine molecules to reach the nanoparticle surface, which is crucial to avoid the formation of stable coordinative bonds with under-coordinated Ti atoms. Finally, given the strong absorption properties and fluorescence of DOX and of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst, we model the effect of light irradiation through excited state calculations to localize excitons and to follow the charge carrier's life path. This fundamental study on the nature and mechanism of drug/carrier interaction provides a solid ground for the rational design of new experimental protocols for a more efficient drug transport and release and its combination with photodynamic therapy.",Excluded
2365,"Diabetic levels of glucose increase cellular reducing equivalents but reduce survival in three models of 661W photoreceptor-like cell injury. BACKGROUND: The effect of excess glucose on retinal cellular health remains controversial, and cellular reducing equivalents, as indicators of cellular energy production, are widely used as substitute indicators of retinal cellular health. These investigations hypothesised that excess energy substrate availability, as occurs in the diabetic retina, increases the susceptibility of retinal neurons to injury in the presence of increased cellular reducing equivalents.METHODS: The response of 661W cells to phototoxicity, oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and apoptosis induction by staurosporine was characterised in the presence of 5mM glucose and B27 defined media without insulin. Cellular insult was produced by phototoxicity, H2O2 and the apoptosis induction agent staurosporine. The effect of physiologically relevant alterations in environmental glucose on cellular reducing equivalents was assessed by MTT dye reduction and NAD(P)H assays, and cell survival was assessed via caspase 3/7 activation and Annexin V/PI flow cytometry.RESULTS: 661W photoreceptor-like cells underwent dose dependent cell death primarily by apoptosis in response to phototoxic insult, H2O2, and staurosporine by all measures of cellular viability. Exposure of cells to 25mM glucose (diabetic-type conditions) increased cell death in response to all insults as measured by caspase 3/7 activation and Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Cellular reducing equivalents were nonetheless increased in all models of injury in the presence of excess glucose. The mechanism of this increase was partly due to increased NADPH but not NADH levels in the presence of 25mM glucose.CONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to 25mM glucose decreased the resilience of 661W photoreceptor-like cells to a range of cellular stressors whilst maintaining or increasing cellular reducing equivalents, partly be increasing NADPH levels. This shows that in 661W cells, diabetic levels of glucose decrease cellular resilience to injury. The decoupling of cellular reducing equivalents levels from cell survival has important implications when investigating the mechanisms of neuronal damage in diabetic retinal neuropathy.",Excluded

Dosimetry was performed according to MIRD scheme. Eleven NET patients who had undergone splenectomy before PRRNT and who received 4.7-7.6 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE or (177)Lu-DOTATOC were selected as controls. RBC, WBC (total and differential), and platelet counts before and after each cycle of PRRNT were documented.RESULTS: The median dose to the spleen in the study group was 6.34 Gy (2.32-20.06 Gy). There was no significant difference in the posttherapy changes in the blood cell counts (RBC, WBC, or platelets) between the study group and the control group.

Background: In breast cancer surgery, patient-reported outcome measures are needed to measure outcomes best reported by patients (e.g., psychosocial well-being). This study aimed to develop and validate a new BREAST-Q module to address the unique concerns of patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Method(s): Phase 1 involved qualitative and cognitive interviews with women who had BCT and clinical expert input to establish content for the BCT module. A field-test (phase 2) was performed, and Rasch measurement theory (RMT) analysis was used for item reduction and examination of reliability and validity. Validation of the item-reduced scales in a clinical sample (phase 3) was conducted for further assessment of their psychometric properties. Result(s): Qualitative interviews with 24 women resulted in the addition of 15 new items across multiple existing BREAST-Q scales and the development of two new scales (Adverse Effects of Radiation and Satisfaction With Information-Radiation Therapy). Feedback from 15 patients and 5 clinical experts were used to refine the instructions, response options, and item wording. An RMT analysis of data from 3497 women resulted in item reduction. The final set of scales showed evidence of ordered response option thresholds, good item fit, and good reliability, except for the Adverse Effects of the Radiation Scale. Validity and reliability were further supported by the phase 3 data from 3125 women. Conclusion(s): The BREAST-Q BCT module can be used in research and clinical care to evaluate quality metrics and to compare surgical outcomes across all breast cancer surgery patients.

Changes in the intracellular and extracellular redox balance have been correlated with cell fate decisions in terms of proliferation versus differentiation, entering versus existing cell cycle and survival versus cell death. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been correlated with neuronal plasticity of learning and memory; however, the process is exquisitely sensitive to changes in redox balance. Cranial irradiation is an effective modality in treating brain tumours but often leads to deficits in hippocampus-related learning and memory, which is most likely due to sustained elevation of oxygen free radical production and suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. The subcellular redox environment affecting hippocampal neurogenesis is largely unknown. Using mutant mice deficient in each one of the three superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) isoforms, we have begun to determine the consequences of SOD deficiency in hippocampal neurogenesis and the related functions of learning and memory under normal condition and following cranial irradiation.",Excluded

After comparing the habituation indices, the multi-scale entropies and the time dependent intrinsic correlations of their SSVEP signals, we reached a tentative conclusion that sharp red and white light pulses flickering barely above their CFF frequencies can replace commonly used 13Hz stimuli to effectively cause SSVEP habituation among normal subjects. Empirical results showed that consecutive short bursts of light can produce more consistent responses than a single prolonged stimulation. Since these high frequency stimuli do not run the risk of triggering migraine or seizure attacks, further tests of these stimuli on migraine patients are warranted in order to verify their effectiveness.",Excluded

The radioisotope cisternogram has proven itself to be a valuable diagnostic procedure during the evaluation of patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. If it is not possible to define the origin of such a leak, extensive intracranial explorations may be required, which may or may not result in successful correction of the defect. As a functional examination with limited risk to the patient and minimal radiation exposure, the isotopic cisternogram can either establish a diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea or eliminate cerebrospinal fluid as a cause for rhinorrhea. When occurring, CSF leaks can be shown by demonstrating a 'path' from the cranial fossage into the nasal cavity. The present technique utilizes tampons placed in each nostril. A positive diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea is made by finding a tampon impregnated with at least twice the radioactivity of a control tampon from the opposite nostril (in the presence of an intact septum). Conclusions indicate that a positive anterior fossa cisternogram may be the only evidence for hidden site of CSF leakage, especially when other signs are lacking.",Excluded

High threshold evoked responses (conduction velocity was about 11 m/sec, unmyelinated A delta), which were induced by an electrical stimulation to the peripheral stump of the nerve, were significantly suppressed (9 to 19% inhibition) during low-power laser irradiation, which applied to the exposed sural nerve between the stimulus site and the recording site. The suppressive effect was reversible and recovered to the control level after the irradiation. Experimental evidence indicated that low-power laser irradiation suppressed the impulse conduction of unmyelinated A delta afferents in peripheral sensory nerve, which caused a pain sensation.

Method of local adjustment of the parameters of mathematical models (examples of application)]. To increase the accuracy of calculation of tolerance doses of the likelihood of radiation-induced complications in normal organs and tissues by using mathematical models, the author has developed a method for local mathematical model parameter adjustment (LMMPA) which included analysis of the structure of a mathematical model, systematization of clinical information and its goal-oriented use to determine the parameters of a model. The necessity of developing the LMMPA method stemmed from the complexity of the body exposed to radiation a system and from the quest for taking into account the impact of the system on the values of mathematical models. LMMPA may be regarded as the extension of determination of the parameters of mathematical models or as the interactive determination of their parameters that describing radiation exposures of complex biological systems. Different aspects of using of LMMPA are indicated how to apply it to the determination of tolerance doses for connective tissue, lung tissue, and the brain by using the Ellis and LQ models.

The properties of hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and the effect of hypoxia on the current have been studied using whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Under voltage-clamp mode, I(h), blocked by 1 mM extracellular CsCl, was present in 75.5% of mouse DRG neurons. The distribution rate increased as the neurons become larger, 5.3%, 79.8% and 94.2% in small, medium and large neurons, respectively. Both I(h) density and the rate of I(h) activation increased in response to more hyperpolarized potential. The activation of I(h) current in larger neuron was faster than in smaller neuron, there was a significant correlation between the time constant of I(h) activation and neuron's size. However, I(h) density did not show any correlation with neuron's size. Under current-clamp mode, 'depolarizing sag' was observed in all neurons with I(h) current. The reversal potential (V(rev)) and the maximal conductance density of I(h) (G(h.max-density)) were -31.0 +/- 4.8 mV and 0.17 +/- 0.02 nS/pF, with a half-activated potential (V(0.5) = -99.4 +/- 1.1 mV) and a slope factor (kappa = -10.2 +/- 0.3 mV). There was a correlation between neuron's size and G(h.max-density) only. According to the effect of hypoxia on resting membrane potential, there were hypoxia-sensitive and hypoxia-insensitive neurons. In the hypoxia-sensitive neurons, I(h) was fully abolished by hypoxia, although the resting membrane potential was hyperpolarized. V(0.5) and V(rev) were shifted about 30 mV toward hyperpolarization, whereas G(h.max-density) and kappa were not affected by hypoxia. We suggest that the kinetics and voltage-dependent characteristics of I(h) are varied in mouse DRG neurons with different size. Hypoxia inhibits I(h) in the hypoxia-sensitive neurons by shifting its activation potential to a more hyperpolarized level.",Excluded

1935,"Radiation dose reduction using real-time image processing in interventional radiology. Purpose: To characterize changes in radiation dose after introducing a new real-time image processing technology in interventional radiology systems. Method(s): Interventional radiology (IR) procedures are increasingly complex, at times requiring substantial time and radiation dose. The risk of inducing tissue reactions as well as long-term stochastic effects such as radiation-induced cancer is not trivial. To reduce this risk, IR systems are increasingly equipped with dose reduction technologies. Recently, ClarityIQ (Philips Healthcare) technology was installed in our existing neuroradiology IR (NIR) and vascular IR (VIR) suites respectively. ClarityIQ includes realtime image processing that reduces noise/artifacts, enhances images, and sharpens edges while also reducing radiation dose rates. We reviewed 412 NIR (175 pre-and 237 post-ClarityIQ) procedures and 329 VIR (156 preand 173 post-ClarityIQ) procedures performed at our institution pre-and post-ClarityIQ implementation. NIR procedures were primarily classified as interventional or diagnostic. VIR procedures included drain port, drain placement, tube change, mesenteric, and implanted venous procedures. Air Kerma (AK in units of mGy) was documented for all the cases using a commercial radiation exposure management system. Result(s): When considering all NIR procedures, median AK decreased from 1194 mGy to 561 mGy. When considering all VIR procedures, median AK decreased from 49 to 14 mGy. Both NIR and VIR exhibited a decrease in AK exceeding 50% after ClarityIQ implementation, a statistically significant (p<0.05) difference. Of the 5 most common VIR procedures, all median AK values decreased, but significance (p<0.05) was only reached in venous access (N=53), angio mesenteric (N=41), and drain placement procedures (N=31).

Most vertebrate retinas contain two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, which show different photoresponses to mediate scotopic and photopic vision, respectively. These cells contain different types of visual pigments, rhodopsin and cone visual pigments, respectively, but little is known about the molecular properties of cone visual pigments under physiological conditions, making it difficult to link the molecular properties of rhodopsin and cone visual pigments with the differences in photoresponse between rods and cones. Here we prepared bovine and mouse rhodopsin (bvRh and mRh) and chicken and mouse green-sensitive cone visual pigments (cG and mG) embedded in nanodiscs and applied time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to compare their Gt activation efficiencies. Rhodopsin exhibited greater Gt activation efficiencies than cone visual pigments. Especially, the Gt activation efficiency of mRh was about 2.5-fold greater than that of mG at 37 degreeC, which is consistent with our previous electrophysiological data of knock-in mice. Although the active state (Meta-II) was in equilibrium with inactive states (Meta-I and Meta-III), quantitative determination of Meta-II in the equilibrium showed that the Gt activation efficiency per Meta-II of bvRh was also greater than those of cG and mG. These results indicated that efficient Gt activation by rhodopsin, resulting from an optimized active state of rhodopsin, is one of the causes of the high amplification efficiency of rods.",Excluded
1442,"Morning and evening peaks of activity rely on different clock neurons of the Drosophila brain. In Drosophila, a 'clock' situated in the brain controls circadian rhythms of locomotor activity. This clock relies on several groups of neurons that express the Period (PER) protein, including the ventral lateral neurons (LN(v)s), which express the Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptide, and the PDF-negative dorsal lateral neurons (LN(d)s). In normal cycles of day and night, adult flies exhibit morning and evening peaks of activity; however, the contribution of the different clock neurons to the rest-activity pattern remains unknown. Here, we have used targeted expression of PER to restore the clock function of specific subsets of lateral neurons in arrhythmic per(0) mutant flies. We show that PER expression restricted to the LN(v)s only restores the morning activity, whereas expression of PER in both the LN(v)s and LN(d)s also restores the evening activity. This provides the first neuronal bases for 'morning' and 'evening' oscillators in the Drosophila brain. Furthermore, we show that the LN(v)s alone can generate 24 h activity rhythms in constant darkness, indicating that the morning oscillator is sufficient to drive the circadian system.",Excluded

2382,"Impact of brain metastasis velocity on neurologic death for brain metastasis patients experiencing distant brain failure after initial stereotactic radiosurgery. PURPOSE: Patients with high rates of developing new brain metastases have an increased likelihood of dying of neurologic death. It is unclear, however, whether this risk is affected by treatment choice following failure of primary stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: From July 2000 to March 2017, 440 patients with brain metastasis were treated with SRS and progressed to have a distant brain failure (DBF). Eighty-seven patients were treated within the immunotherapy era. Brain metastasis velocity (BMV) was calculated for each patient. In general, the institutional philosophy for use of salvage SRS vs whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) was to postpone the use of WBRT for as long as possible and to treat with salvage SRS when feasible. No further treatment was reserved for patients with poor life expectancy and who were not expected to benefit from salvage treatment.RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five patients were treated with repeat SRS, 91 patients were treated with salvage WBRT, and 64 patients received no salvage radiation therapy. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death after salvage SRS vs WBRT was 15% vs 23% for the low- (p = 0.06), 30% vs 37% for the intermediate- (p < 0.01), and 31% vs 48% (p < 0.01) for the high-BMV group. Salvage WBRT was associated with increased incidence of neurologic death on multivariate analysis (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.39, p = 0.01) when compared to repeat SRS. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death for patients treated within the immunotherapy era was 9%, 38%, and 38% for low-, intermediate-, and high-BMV groups, respectively (p = 0.01).CONCLUSION: Intermediate and high risk BMV groups are predictive of neurologic death.

Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that is seeing increasing use in neuro-oncology and offers an alternative to contrast-enhanced perfusion techniques for evaluation of tumor blood volume after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). To date, IVIM has not been validated against contrast enhanced techniques for brain metastases after SRS. In the present study, we measure blood volume for 20 brain metastases (15 patients) at baseline, 1 week and 1 month after SRS using IVIM and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI. Correlation between blood volume measurements made with IVIM and DCE-MRI show poor correlation at baseline, 1 week, and 1 month post SRS (r = 0.33, 0.14 and 0.30 respectively). At 1 week after treatment, no significant change in tumor blood volume was found using IVIM or DCE-MRI (p = 0.81 and 0.41 respectively). At 1 month, DCE-MRI showed a significant decrease in blood volume (p = 0.0002). IVIM, on the other hand, demonstrated the opposite effect and showed a significant increase in blood volume at 1 month (p = 0.03). The results of this study indicate that blood volume measured with IVIM and DCE-MRI are not equivalent. While this may relate to differences in the type of perfusion information each technique is providing, it could also reflect a limitation of tumor blood volume measurements made with IVIM after SRS. IVIM measurements of tumor blood volume in the month after SRS should therefore be interpreted with caution.",Excluded

We employed a triple-headed SPECT gammacamera system equipped with fan beam collimators for acquisition with line transmission sources placed at the focal lines of the fan-beam collimators. Two mode, sequential mode and simultaneous mode, of data acquisition protocols were examined. In the sequential mode, a transmission scan was carried out using three external sources for the brain phantom without emission tracer. After removing all sources, an emission scan was performed on the brain phantom containing the tracer. In the simultaneous mode, the injection was followed by a simultaneous transmission emission scan using one transmission source. The same study was conducted out for the normal volunteer, after confirming the effectiveness of these protocols with phantom studies. Corrected SPECT count values obtained with two protocols were almost identical. Simultaneous mode had advantages in avoiding misalignment between transmission and emission data and in shorter acquisition time than sequential mode.",Excluded

The amount of neutral lipids and phospholipids in nuclei of rat thymus, liver and neocortex neuron as well as the amount of lipids in rat thymus and liver chromatin are described. The metabolic responses of nuclear and chromatin lipids from thymus to different doses and dose rates of gamma-irradiation of rats are discussed. In most cases, the nuclear and chromatin lipid responses are distinct. Changes in nuclear and chromatin lipid metabolism in response to gamma-irradiation are suggested to connect with the signal transduction pathway and the regulation of the transcriptional and replicative chromatin activity. The influence of beta-carotene and picrotoxin on rat liver nuclear lipids and neocortex neuronal nuclear lipids, respectively, was analyzed. The possible involvement of the lipid traffic in the chromatin lipid responses to gamma-irradiation and other agents is suggested. [References: 66]",Excluded

We analyzed the usefulness of a symptom questionnaire to screen for radiation-induced brachial plexopathy (RIBP) after breast cancer treatment. Four questions addressed distal and proximal paresis: impaired hand functions, problems raising the arm, carrying weights, and lifting objects from a high shelf. Eighty-one relapse-free patients were neurologically examined. Treatment was mastectomy (51%) or breast-conserving surgery (49%), radiotherapy to the supraclavicular +/- axilla with median 60 Gy maximum dose. Sixty-five subsequent control patients had breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy to the breast only with 55 Gy median dose. Median follow up was 10 and 7.4 years, respectively. Sixteen patients had RIBP, 7 had Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 1, 4 grade 2, 3 grade 3, and 2 grade 4 RIBP. Thirty-seven patients had fibrosis and 32 had arm edema. Four patients with RIBP had no fibrosis (n = 2) or fibrosis of the axilla only (n = 2). Specificity of the question ""impaired hand functions"" for RIBP was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.78); sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96). Specificity of the question ""raising the arm"" was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.9-0.99) and sensitivity was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04-0.45); the rate of false-positive control patients was 3%. In multivariate analysis, ""impaired hand functions"" and fibrosis were independent indicators of RIBP (P <0.005). Patients with breast irradiation only stated moderate/pronounced impaired hand functions; and problems carrying weights and lifting objects from a high shelf in 38%, 58%, and 77%, not significantly different from patients with RIBP or the patients with supraclavicular radiation. RIBP is not necessarily associated with fibrosis. The aim of the questionnaire was screening of a population at risk for RIBP. In this group, the question ""problems raising the arm"" detected severe RIBP with high specificity. Negation of ""impaired hand functions"" excludes RIBP.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed as a key regulator and mediator of long-term synaptic modifications related to learning and memory maintenance. Our previous studies show that application of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) sufficient to elicit LTP at the dentate gyrus (DG)-CA3 pathway produces mossy fiber structural modifications 7 days after tetanic stimulation. In the present study, we show that acute intrahippocampal microinfusion of BDNF induces a lasting potentiation of synaptic efficacy in the DG-CA3 projection of anesthetized adult rats. Furthermore, we show that BDNF functional modifications in synaptic efficacy are accompanied by a presynaptic structural long-lasting reorganization at the hippocampal mossy fiber pathway. These findings support the idea that BDNF plays an important role as synaptic messenger of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult mammalian brain, in vivo.",Excluded
2295,"[Problems and chances of high field magnetic resonance imaging]. [German]. The spatial, temporal and spectral resolution in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is in many cases currently not sufficient to detect submillimeter lesions or to image the dynamics of the beating heart. At present MRI systems at 1.5 T and 3 T are the standard units for clinical imaging. The use of ultrahigh magnetic fields of 7 T and higher increases the signal-to-noise ratio, which holds promise for a significant improvement of the spatial and/or temporal resolution as well as for new contrast mechanisms. With 7 T MRI, images of the brain have been acquired routinely with a spatial resolution of 0.3 mm. The theoretical improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio is often not fully realized due to B1 inhomogeneities and contrast variations. With MRI at 7 T a notable increase in spatial resolution can be achieved. Methods such as time-of-flight MR angiography and susceptibility-weighted imaging (e.g. neurofunctional MRI, fMRI) profit especially from the higher field strengths. Transmission field inhomogeneities are still a major challenge for ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI and are also a partially unsolved safety problem. The use of UHF MRI is currently limited to special applications and the expected gain of the high field must be weighed against technical limitations in both image acquisition and interpretation.",Excluded
1350,"Reproducibility of patient positioning during routine radiotherapy, as assessed by an integrated megavoltage imaging system. A portal imaging system has been used, in conjunction with a movie measurement technique to measure set-up errors for 15 patients treated with radiotherapy of the pelvis and for 12 patients treated with radiotherapy of the brain. The pelvic patients were treated without fixation devices and the brain patients were treated with individually-moulded plastic shells. As would be expected the brain treatments were found to be more accurate than the pelvic treatments. Results are presented in terms of five error types: random error from treatment to treatment, error between mean treatment position and simulation position, random simulation error, systematic simulator-to-treatment errors and total treatment error. For the brain patients the simulation-to-treatment error predominates and random treatment errors were small (95% < or = 3 mm, 77% < or = 1.5 mm). Vector components of the systematic simulation-to-treatment errors were 1-2 mm with maximal random simulation error of +/- 5 mm (2 S.D.). There is much interest in the number of verification films necessary to evaluate treatment accuracy. These results indicate that one check film performed at the first treatment is likely to be sufficient for set-up evaluation. For the pelvis the random treatment error is larger (95% < or = 4.5 mm, 87% < or = 3 mm). The systematic simulation-to-treatment error is up to 3 mm and the maximal random simulation error is +/- 6 mm (2 S.D.).

2091,"Involvement of protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPMEG in motor learning and cerebellar long-term depression. Although protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is important for hippocampus-dependent learning, its role in cerebellum-dependent learning remains unclear. We previously found that PTPMEG, a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs), bound to the carboxyl-terminus of the glutamate receptor delta2 via the postsynaptic density-95/discs-large/ZO-1 domain of PTPMEG. In the present study, we generated PTPMEG-knockout (KO) mice, and addressed whether PTPMEG is involved in cerebellar plasticity and cerebellum-dependent learning. The structure of the cerebellum in PTPMEG-KO mice appeared grossly normal. However, we found that PTPMEG-KO mice showed severe impairment in the accelerated rotarod test. These mice also exhibited impairment in rapid acquisition of the cerebellum-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning, in which conditioned stimulus (450-ms tone) and unconditioned stimulus (100-ms periorbital electrical shock) were co-terminated. Moreover, long-term depression at parallel fiber-PC synapses was significantly attenuated in these mice. Developmental elimination of surplus climbing fibers and the physiological properties of excitatory synaptic inputs to PCs appeared normal in PTPMEG-KO mice. These results suggest that tyrosine dephosphorylation events regulated by PTPMEG are important for both motor learning and cerebellar synaptic plasticity.",Excluded

Objectives: The co-incidence of sleep disorders in cancer patients has been described but the impact of head and neck radiation on the development of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is not specifically known. Our objective was to assess the incidence of OSA in head and neck cancer (HNSCC) patients treated with radiation. Method(s): We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with oropharyngeal or laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with primary radiation therapy. Patients underwent a 3-night home sleep study (HST) and completed the Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS) and Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10). Exclusion criteria included any oncologic surgical procedure, active disease, or completion of radiation therapy within the past 3 months. Result(s): To date, 14 patients have been enrolled who are an average of 63.2 years old, with a mean body mass index of 29.2, and 93% male. Nine of 14 patients had human papillomavirus- positive tumors and were of laryngeal (4), tonsillar (5), and base of tongue (5) origin. The mean ESS and FOSQ- 10 were 7.6 and 33.3, respectively.

Objective This study aims to evaluate dynamic morphological changes of intracranial aneurysms to predict intraoperative aneurysm rupture (IAR) during clipping. Methods Included in this study were 153 patients, who had ruptured and microsurgical-clipped aneurysms. All patients underwent dual-source computed tomography examination of electrocardiography-gated dynamic 4-dimensional computed tomography angiography before clipping. Original scanning data were reconstructed to produce 20 data sets of cardiac cycles with 5% time intervals. The aneurysm neck, transverse and longitudinal diameters, and volume from the 20 groups of images were measured to calculate their respective change rates. In addition, other data and clinical characteristics were recorded. Data were analyzed by logistic regression to identify factors associated with IAR. Results Of the 153 patients, 24 patients experienced IAR. Multivariable analysis revealed that the aneurysm neck change rate (P = 0.0001; odds ratio, 1.276) and aspect ratio (height/neck ratio, P = 0.025; odds ratio, 2.387) are predictors for IAR. When the change rate was greater than or equal to 60%, and the sensitivity and specificity were 91.7% and 76.7%, respectively. Conclusions Aneurysm neck change rate is independent predictor of IAR.

2319,"Ketamine pre-treatment dissociates the effects of electroconvulsive stimulation on mossy fibre sprouting and cellular proliferation in the dentate gyrus. Electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), the experimental analogue of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), has been shown to produce both functional and structural effects in the hippocampal formation in infrahuman species. These changes may relate to the antidepressant and cognitive effects of ECT observed in patients treated for severe depressive disorders. Recent studies have described both enhanced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and sprouting of mossy fibre projections from granule cells. The behavioural significance of these effects remains uncertain. In this study, we examined whether ketamine, a clinically available non-competitive NMDA receptor channel blocker, could block both of these ""trophic"" effects. Rats were given a course of eight spaced ECS or sham treatments under either halothane or ketamine anaesthesia. The thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine was administered to assess the degree of hippocampal cell proliferation and mossy fibre sprouting was quantified using the Timm staining method. Pre-treatment with ketamine dissociated these effects such that mossy fibre sprouting was attenuated significantly, while cell proliferation was unaffected. This dissociation may prove useful in determining the behavioural significance of these hippocampal changes, if any, for either the antidepressant or cognitive consequences of ECT.",Excluded

1222,"Time course of the flash response of dark- and light-adapted human rod photoreceptors derived from the electroretinogram. 1. The a-wave of the electroretinogram was recorded from human subjects with normal vision, using a corneal electrode and ganzfeld stimulation. We applied the paired-flash technique, in which an intense 'probe' flash was delivered at different times after a 'test' flash. The amplitude of the probe-flash response provided a measure of the circulating current remaining at the appropriate time after the test flash. 2. We extended previous methods by measuring not at a fixed time, but at a range of times after the probe flash, and then calculating the ratio of the 'test-plus-probe' response to the 'probe-alone' response, as a function of time. 3. Under dark-adapted conditions the rod response derived by the paired-flash technique (in response to a relatively dim test flash) peaked at ca 120 ms, with a fractional sensitivity at the peak of ca 0.1 Td(-1) s(-1). 4. As reported previously, background illumination reduced the maximal response, reflecting a reduction in rod circulating current. In addition, it shortened the time to peak (to ca 70 ms at an intensity of 170 Td), and reduced the flash sensitivity measured at the peak. The flash sensitivity declined approximately according to Weber's Law, with a 10-fold reduction occurring at an intensity of 100-200 Td. We could not reliably measure responses at significantly higher background intensities because the circulating current became so small. 5. In order to investigate the phototransduction process after correction for response compression, we expressed the derived response as a fraction of the maximal response that could be elicited in the presence of the background. The earliest rising phase of this 'fractional response per unit intensity' was little affected by background illumination, suggesting that the amplification constant of transduction was unaltered by light adaptation.",Excluded
2042,"The Role of Advanced Imaging in Assessing Response to Definitive Chemoradiation Before Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer. We examined the responses to chemoradiation according to imaging modality in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Provided patients achieved at least a partial response, advanced imaging response neither affected survival nor added information to the decision to offer prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), suggesting that limited-stage SCLC patients with partial response using any imaging modality should not be denied PCI. Introduction: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) improves survival for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Evidence for PCI in limited-stage SCLC largely derives from studies requiring only chest x-ray (CXR) to determine remission status. We analyzed thoracic chemoradiation therapy (TCRT) outcomes according to imaging modality to determine which patients benefitted most from PCI. Patients and Methods: All limited-stage SCLC patients who received TCRT as well as PCI at our institution were reviewed. Imaging between TCRT end and PCI start was characterized as complete (CR), partial (PR), or other response. Result(s): Thirty-eight consecutive patients were assessed for TCRT response before PCI with CXR (n = 21), chest computed tomography (CT; n = 27), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (n = 11). CR was identified on 71% of CXRs, 41% of CT scans, and 18% of PET/CT scans. Median survival was 28.3 months for the entire cohort and did not differ for patients who had CXR alone versus CT and/or PET/CT for restaging (P =.78) or those with PR using any modality versus CR using all modalities (22.6 months vs. 45.5 months; P =.22). CT CR patients had numerical but not statistically significant improved 2-year (P =.18) and 3-year (P =.13) survival compared with CT PR. Conclusion(s): CXR remains an appropriate modality to assess TCRT response before PCI in limited-stage SCLC. Advanced imaging did not inform the decision to offer PCI in this study. Because of similar excellent survival profiles independent of imaging modality and TCRT response, this analysis suggests limited-stage SCLC patients with PR using any modality should not be denied PCI, akin to standards for extensive-stage SCLC.

Background: We sought to determine the surgical treatment and functional outcome and identify the predictors of survival in a retrospective cohort of patients with spinal cord ependymoma using data collected from the Korea Spinal Oncology Research Group database. Method(s): The data regarding 88 patients who had been surgically treated for histologically confirmed spinal cord intramedullary and extramedullary ependymoma from January 1989 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Histopathological examination revealed myxopapillary ependymoma in 24 patients, ependymoma in 61 patients, and anaplastic ependymoma in 3 patients. Gross total removal was achieved in 72 patients, subtotal removal in 15 patients, and partial removal in 1 patient. Twenty patients were treated with postoperative radiation. Fifty-two patients had stable or improved postoperative neurological function, while 36 experienced neurological deterioration. A permanent decrease in McCormick classification grade was seen in 17 patients. The progression-free survival rate was 87% for all patients at 5 years and 80% at 10 years. During follow-up, local recurrence/progression was seen in 13 patients. Diffuse meningeal spread developed in 2 anaplastic ependymoma patients. Postoperative radiotherapy after incomplete resection did not significantly correlate with longer times to recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed histology and surgical extent of resection as independent predictors of longer progression-free survival. Conclusion(s): Gross total removal alone is a good treatment strategy for spinal ependymomas. Early diagnosis and surgery, before severe paralysis, are important to obtain good functional outcomes. Subtotal resection with radiation therapy for intramedullary lesions appears to offer no advantages over gross total removal. © 2013 The Author(s).",Included
1623,"The influence of mineralising radionecrosis on the dose distribution in interstitial radiation therapy of brain tumours. The influences of radionecroses arising during interstitial radiation of brain tumours with 125I, 192Ir or 198Au on dose distribution was investigated using Monte Carlo methods. The necroses have a higher density than normal tissue due to radiation-induced changes in tissue composition as well as mineral deposits. They can have a diameter of up to 1 cm around the single seeds. The higher density and changed chemical composition compared to homogeneous normal tissue leads to increased absorption of radiation around the necroses which results in a lower dose rate in the surrounding tissue. It is shown that the formation of necroses during treatment with higher energy radiation such as 192Ir (340 keV) or 198Au (400 keV) may be neglected during therapy planning as the dose rate is affected by less than 2%. If low energy radiation, e.g. 125I (28 keV) is used, the dose rate can be reduced by more than 30%. In this case the influence of the necroses on dose distribution, at least for permanent 125I implantation, may not be negligible.",Excluded

All mice were assessed according to the Rapid Murine Coma and Behavioral Scale (RMCBS) score once naive mice showed ECM. We further analyzed brain pathology by using high resolution small animal MRI in order to assess brain swelling and blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), immunohistochemical staining for microglia, single plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) to locate parasites microscopically and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to study parasites on a nanoscopic level. In contrast to naive mice, that showed extensive BBBD and brain swelling, all immunized mice survived the challenge and showed either reversible brain swelling and mild BBBD or no pathological signal alteration on MRI. Furthermore, less microglial activation was found in immunized mice compared to naive mice. However, along the rostral migratory stream microglial activation appeared to be similar in both groups. Distinct brain areas with higher parasite density could be observed in both groups, although parasite distribution was more disseminated in naive mice. By employing CLEM, we demonstrated that parasites have a high propensity towards the endothelium. In summary, we showed for the first time that reversible brain swelling also occurs in a mouse model of ECM by using advanced imaging techniques. We further identified hot spots of parasite accumulation and inflammation. This model may present a valuable tool to understand the mechanisms of reversible brain swelling in ECM. .",Excluded

If eFBB can be used for AD diagnosis, it can help to reduce radiation exposure and increase patient convinnience by discriminating between amyloid nagative AD and positive NC and replacing 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Method(s): We retrospectively collected 264 cases of eFBB, which included amyloid positive NC (25.42%) and negative AD (16.82%). In order to obtain SUVr for analysis, eFBB and dFBB images of each case were spatially registered though CT template and eFBB template, and count normalization was applied to cerebellum, brainstem, and whole brain regions, respectively to identify the best pre-processing step. We evaluated the explanatory power and classification performance of the data according to the intervention of eFBB through logistic regression analysis (LRA) and stratified 4-fold cross validation. For visual observation of the image, we observed the intensity distribution of the image through the t-contrast embedded in the SPM. Result(s): As a result of LRA, the highest explanatory power and classification performance (Nagelkerke R2=0.648, Accuracy=89.4%) were observed when using eFBB template and whole brain region as a reference region. Regardless, when both eFBB and dFBB were known to the model, the explanatory power and classification performance were improved. In evaluating the generalization performance of the selected model, it was also shown that classification performance improved when eFBB was involved in general.

Mean ADC values at the various time intervals were compared with each other to see whether or not the ADC might be used as an early indicator of treatment success or failure. Result(s): The mean pretreatment value of the ADC in the metastatic tumors was 1.05 +/- 0.12 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s (mean +/- SD). This value for the tumors rose significantly (P = .009) 7 days after SRS and continued to rise with time. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that 91% of these tumors had been controlled by the SRS.

Previously, we have shown that in the cells of patients with AT simultaneously two oppositely-directed development programs are proceeding: accelerated aging or the rise of the classical markers of aging number, such as the SA-beta-ga1, SAHF, HP1-gamma, gamma-H2AX, 53BP; and transformation or a sharp decline in the effectiveness of DNA repair processes and a high level of chromosomal rearrangements.<sup>1,2,3</sup> The cause of the disease is a mutation in the protein kinase ATM localized on chromosome 11 (11q22.3).<sup>4</sup> Up until now more than 80 mutations (on the locations of which the severity of the disease is dependent) resulting in the development of AT on this gene have been described.<sup>5</sup> Basing on the dynamics of the process of repair after gamma irradiation we can determine not only the presence of the AT syndrome, but its heterozygous.

Radiotherapeutic treatment consists of targeted application of radiation beams to a tumor but exposure of surrounding healthy tissue is inevitable. In the brain, ionizing radiation induces breakdown of the blood-brain barrier by effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. Damage from directly irradiated cells can be transferred to surrounding non-exposed bystander cells, known as the radiation-induced bystander effect. We investigated involvement of connexin channels and paracrine signaling in radiation-induced bystander DNA damage in brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to focused X-rays. Irradiation caused DNA damage in the directly exposed area, which propagated over several millimeters in the bystander area. DNA damage was significantly reduced by the connexin channel-targeting peptide Gap26 and the Cx43 hemichannel blocker TAT-Gap19. ATP release, dye uptake, and patch clamp experiments showed that hemichannels opened within 5 min post irradiation in both irradiated and bystander areas. Bystander signaling involved cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and IP<inf>3</inf>, ATP, ROS, and NO signaling, with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, IP<inf>3</inf>, and ROS as crucial propagators of DNA damage.

PURPOSE: Neuropathic pain is an unavoidable treatment-related adverse event among patients with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiotherapy. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of pregabalin versus placebo in the treatment of radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in four centers in China. Eligible patients with a mean pain intensity score of 4 or more on an 11-point numeric rating scale were randomly assigned to receive either active treatment with a flexible dose of pregabalin or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was pain reduction measured on the numeric rating scale.RESULT: There were 128 patients who received treatment as randomly assigned. Pain intensity reduction was 2.44 in the pregabalin arm and 1.58 in the placebo arm at week 16, yielding an adjusted mean difference of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.30 to 1.44; P = .003). In the pregabalin arm, 38 patients (59.4%) achieved at least 30% pain relief versus 21 (32.8%) in the placebo arm ( P = .006). Nineteen patients (29.7%) in the pregabalin group and five (7.8%) in the placebo group achieved 50% or greater pain relief ( P = .003). Total scores on the Profile of Mood States-Short Form, pain severity and functional interference of Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, as well as the physiology and psychology domain of the WHO Quality of Life-BREF all were reduced significantly at week 16 in patients who received pregabalin compared with those who received placebo. There was no significant difference ( P = .29) in the incidence of experiencing at least one adverse event in the pregabalin arm (n = 35; 54.7%) versus the placebo arm (n = 29; 45.3%).CONCLUSION: Patients treated with pregabalin with radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain had greater pain alleviation, better mood states, and higher quality of life compared with patients in the placebo group, with a good tolerability.",Excluded

We recorded electroretinograms from anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys by means of three monochromatic (435, 524 or 579 nm) full-field stimuli presented with a monochromatic background light. The color of the background light was changed with 29 interference filters (400-700 nm). Waveforms were analyzed by means of principal component analysis to investigate interaction between the short-wavelength cone and other systems. With the same test lights, responses were also recorded during dark adaptation after 20,000-lux full bleach. The shape of the short-wavelength cone electroretinogram changed as a function of the wavelength of monochromatic background light. The change was clearer around 500-nm background light, to which the rod system is highly sensitive. Further, short-wavelength cone responses developed during the first 15 min in the dark; however, they became smaller with the recovery of the rod system. These findings suggest that there is interaction between the short-wavelength cone and rod systems. In addition, the results of waveform analysis confirmed the interaction between the long-wavelength and middle-wavelength cone systems.",Excluded

2115,"Inhibition of rhodopsin kinase by recoverin. Further evidence for a negative feedback system in phototransduction. Recoverin is a 23-kDa Ca(2+)-binding protein found predominantly in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Recent electrophysiological and biochemical studies suggest that recoverin may regulate the photoresponse by inhibiting rhodopsin phosphorylation. We find in both cell homogenates and reconstituted systems that the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by recoverin occurs over a significantly higher free Ca2+ range than previously reported. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at 1.5-3 microM free Ca2+ and is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2. Measurements of transducin activation demonstrate that this inhibition prolongs the lifetime of catalytically active rhodopsin. Ca(2+)-recoverin directly inhibits rhodopsin kinase activity, and Ca(2+)-dependent binding of recoverin to rod outer segment membranes is not required for its action. Extrapolation of the in vitro data to in vivo conditions based on simple mass action calculations places the Ca(2+)-recoverin regulation within the physiological free Ca2+ range in intact rod outer segment. The data are consistent with a model in which the fall in free Ca2+ that accompanies rod excitation exerts negative feedback by relieving inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation.",Excluded
2357,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for metastatic melanoma: An analysis of survival, outcome, and complications. OBJECTIVE: Although the mainstays for treatment of metastatic brain disease have been surgery and/or external beam radiation therapy, an increasing number of patients are being referred for stereotactic radiosurgery as the primary intervention for their intracranial pathological abnormalities. The lack of efficacy and cognitive and behavioral consequences of whole brain irradiation have prompted clinicians to select patients for alternative therapies. This study analyzes the effectiveness of Leksell gamma unit therapy for metastatic melanoma to the brain. METHOD(S): We present our experience with 59 Leksell gamma unit treatment sessions in 45 consecutive patients who presented with metastatic melanoma to the brain. Five of these procedures were performed as salvage therapy for patients who needed second radiosurgical treatment for new lesions that were remote from the previous targets and were not included in the overall analyses. RESULT(S): The population included 78% male patients. The mean patient age was 53 years (age range, 24-80 yr). The mean time from diagnosis of primary melanoma to discovery of brain metastasis was 43 months (median, 27.5 mo; range, 1-180 mo). At the time of diagnosis of brain disease, 35.5% of the patients (16 of 45 patients) had neurological symptoms, 77.7% (35 of 45 patients) had known visceral metastases, and 11.1% (5 of 45 patients) had seizure disorders. Eighty-six percent of the lesions (80 of 93 lesions) were cortical, 12% (11 of 93 lesions) were cerebellar, 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were pontine, and 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were thalamic. Fifty-seven percent of the sessions (31 of 54 sessions) were performed for a single lesion, 24.1% (13 of 54 sessions) for two lesions, 9.2% (5 of 54 sessions) for three lesions, 7.4% (4 of 54 sessions) for four lesions, and 1.8% (1 of 54 sessions) for five lesions. The mean treatment volume was 5.6 cc, with a mean prescription of 21.6 Gy to the 56.0% mean isodose line. The median survival time of the patients in our population, using Kaplan-Meier curves, was 43 months from the time of diagnosis of primary melanoma (range, 3-180 mo) and 8 months (range, 1-20 mo) from the time of gamma knife treatment. Complications included seizures within 24 hours of the procedure in four patients, with transient nausea and vomiting in three patients, transient worsening of preprocedure paresis responsive to steroids in three patients, and increased confusion in one patient. All 45 patients were located for follow-up (mean follow-up duration, 1 yr). After gamma knife treatment, 78% of the patients (35 of 45 patients) experienced either improved or stable neurological symptomatology before death or at the time of the latest follow-up examination. There were 26 deaths (58%). The cause of death was determined to be neurological in only 2 of 45 patients (7.7%). Follow-up magnetic resonance images revealed a 97% local tumor control rate of gamma knife-treated lesions, with 28% radiographic disappearance (9 of 32 cases). Six patients developed new lesions remote from radiosurgical targets and underwent second procedures. CONCLUSION(S): Although metastatic melanoma to the brain continues to have a foreboding prognosis for long-term survival, gamma knife radiosurgery seems to be a relatively safe, noninvasive, palliative therapy, halting or reversing neurological progression in 77.8% of treated patients (35 of 45 patients). The survival rate matches or exceeds those previously reported for surgery and other forms of radiotherapy. Only 7.7% of the patients in our study population who died as a result of metastatic melanoma (2 of 26 patients) died as a result of neurological disease. The routine use of therapeutic level antiseizure medication is emphasized, considering the findings of our review.",Excluded

Taurine (2-aminoethylsuphonic acid) is present in nearly all animal tissues, and is the most abundant free amino acid in muscle, heart, CNS, and retina. Although it is known to be a major cytoprotectant and essential for normal retinal development, its role in retinal neurotransmission and modulation is not well understood. We investigated the response of taurine in retinal ganglion cells, and its effect on synaptic transmission between ganglion cells and their presynaptic neurons. We find that taurine-elicited currents in ganglion cells could be fully blocked by both strychnine and SR95531, glycine and GABA(A) receptor antagonists, respectively. This suggests that taurine-activated receptors might share the antagonists with GABA and glycine receptors. The effect of taurine at micromolar concentrations can effectively suppress spontaneous vesicle release from the presynaptic neurons, but had limited effects on light-evoked synaptic signals in ganglion cells. We also describe a metabotropic effect of taurine in the suppression of light-evoked response in ganglion cells. Clearly, taurine acts in multiple ways to modulate synaptic signals in retinal output neurons, ganglion cells.",Excluded

Electrophysiological responses to electrical stimulation of the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal (GP) nerve (which innervates taste buds on the caudal 1/3 of the tongue) were recorded from single cells in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation was delivered as single pulses (n=55), paired-pulses (n=15) and tetanic trains (n=11). NTS cells with GP-evoked responses were also tested for responsivity to taste stimuli (0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 M sucrose, 0.01 M HCl and 0.01 M quinine HCl). Fifty-five neurons were studied: 49 cells showed GP-evoked (mean latency+/-SEM=18.0+/-1.32 ms); seven of these were taste-responsive. Spontaneous rate of these cells was low (mean+/-SEM=1.4+/-0.3 spikes per second; median=0.21 spikes per second) and many cells showed no spontaneous activity. Paired-pulse stimulation of the GP nerve in 13 rats produced both paired-pulse suppression (n=11) and paired-pulse enhancement (n=4); tetanic stimulation (25 Hz, 1.0 s) produced sustained (>20 s) increases or decreases in firing rate in 7 of 11 cells tested. Histological data suggested that GP-evoked responses recorded in the most rostral NTS were likely the result of polysynaptic connections. Cells with GP-evoked responses formed a heterogeneous group in terms of their response properties and differed from cells with evoked responses to chorda tympani (CT; which innervates taste buds on the rostral 1/3 of the tongue) nerve stimulation.

The increased pressure (up to three atmospheres) induces a 10- to 15-fold plasma oxygen concentration resulting in increased tissue oxygenation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the bactericidal capacity of leukocytes, stimulates important mechanisms in wound healing, reduces tissue oedema and maintains tissue oxygenation even in the absence of haemoglobin. Commonly accepted indications supported by scientific evidence include the decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, severe carbon monoxide poisoning, delayed radiation injury, clostridial myonecrosis and also the improvement of healing of vulnerable skin or soft tissue grafts. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is also used in healing difficulties of specific problem wounds, extreme blood loss, intracranial abscesses, necrotizing soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, crush syndrome, burns and sudden deafness. Since hyperbaric oxygenation involves the administration of oxygen in a pharmacological dose, side effects are possible due to barotrauma and oxygen toxicity. During hyperbaric oxygen therapy, an increased amount of oxygen-free radicals may be generated, depending on the duration and extent of pressure elevation during treatment. Although many different organ systems may be affected, the brain is of greatest clinical significance.

Cell genesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of 2-month-old rabbits has been investigated. After incorporation of tritiated thymidine, electron microscopic autoradiography allowed description of the ultrastructure of the cells labelled and the progressive transformation of these cells into granular neurons to be followed. Quantitative evaluation of the time course of this transformation has been performed by light microscope autoradiography using 1-micrometer sections. Precursor cells, labelled initially with 3H-thymidine, were transformed after 5 days into early neuroblasts, these cells in turn giving rise to neurons some 8 days later. At the latest time period examined (42 days), 80% of the labelled cells were neurons; more than 10% remained as precursor cells. It is suspected that the latter may behave as reserve cells. Small numbers of glial cells, astrocytes, and microglia, scattered throughout the hilus of the dentate gyrus and the molecular layer, were found labelled, and it is possible that they arise from a different precusor pool.

2025,"Stereotactic irradiation of the postoperative resection cavity for brain metastasis: a frameless linear accelerator-based case series and review of the technique. PURPOSE: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the standard of care after resection of a brain metastasis. However, concern regarding possible neurocognitive effects and the lack of survival benefit with this approach has led to the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity in place of WBRT. We report our initial experience using an image-guided linear accelerator-based frameless stereotactic system and review the technical issues in applying this technique.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the setup accuracy, treatment outcome, and patterns of failure of the first 18 consecutive cases treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The target volume was the resection cavity without a margin excluding the surgical track.RESULTS: The median number of brain metastases per patient was 1 (range, 1-3). The median planning target volume was 3.49 mL. The median prescribed dose was 18 Gy (range, 15-18 Gy) with normalization ranging from 68% to 85%. In all cases, 99% of the planning target volume was covered by the prescribed dose. The median conformity index was 1.6 (range, 1.41-1.92). The SRS was delivered with submillimeter accuracy. At a median follow-up of 12.7 months, local control was achieved in 16/18 cavities treated. True local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. No marginal failures occurred. Distant recurrence occurred in 6/17 patients. Median time to any failure was 7.4 months. No Grade 3 or higher toxicity was recorded. A long interval between initial cancer diagnosis and the development of brain metastasis was the only factor that trended toward a significant association with the absence of recurrence (local or distant) (log-rank p = 0.097).CONCLUSIONS: Frameless stereotactic irradiation of the resection cavity after surgery for a brain metastasis is a safe and accurate technique that offers durable local control and defers the use of WBRT in select patients.

The reconciliation of these somewhat opposing functions is challenging. Current literature suggests that radiation and other treatments against the NPC in the hippocampus and the SVZ may influence patient outcome.

1909,"NF-kappa B signaling pathway as a target for human tumor radiosensitization. NF-kappa B is a critical nuclear transcriptional factor that is activated in response to cellular stresses and regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and cell death. When regulated NF-kappa B activation is disrupted, cells undergo apoptosis. That is, constitutively elevated or dysregulated NF-kappa B activation leads to cell death in response to stress. These mechanisms have been shown experimentally by expressing dominant negative inhibitors of NF-kappa B (I kappa B-alpha) in cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutic agents or to ionizing radiation. NF-kappa B also plays an important role in a novel, radiation-inducible signaling pathway that involves the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase. Cells from patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation and exhibit impaired NF-kappa B activation in response to this stress. Restoration of NF-kappa B regulation in AT fibroblasts by introducing a dominant negative form of I kappa B-alpha has resulted in correction of radiation sensitivity and a reduction of ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. Expression of introduced ATM in AT cells results in correction of NF-kappa B regulation and an increase in postradiation survival without reduction in radiation-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these observations support a central role for NF-kappa B regulation in cellular intrinsic radiation sensitivity and apoptosis after exposure to ionizing radiation. Therefore, we hypothesize that the signaling pathway involving ATM/NF-kappa B/I kappa B offers attractive potential molecular targets for radiation sensitization in strategies to enhance the therapeutic ratio in cancer treatment.",Excluded

The autologous bone marrow reinjected had been taken 13 months before the transformation (8 days after the end of busulfan treatment) and frozen using a suboptimal program. Cytogenetically, the chronic phase of CML was characterized by a 46 XX Phi +/46 XX Phi - mosaic. During transformation, 3 clones were evaluated on 25 mitoses: 46 XX Phi - (7 mitoses); 46 XX Phi + (12 mitoses), and 47 XX Phi + with additional C (6 mitoses). The course of the disease after treatment was marked by: (1) disappearance of blast cells; (2) disappearance of the 47 XX Phi + population specific of transformation and of the 46 XX Phi + population. A single, normal 46 XX Phi - population remained 3 months after the bone marrow transplantation: (3) return to normal granulocyte production. However, thrombocytopenia persisted and resulted in death from cerebral haemorrhage on the 95th day. No residual blast cell infiltration was detected on post-mortem. This case shows that a massive treatment arrest acute transformation of CML. It also suggests that because busulfan had provided selective advantages or because the freezing program had been suboptimal, or both, engraftment with the 46 XX Phi -component of the initial mosaic was only partial and incomplete. Finally, it may serve as a model for the management of acute CML transformation using bone marrow autografts.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of SRT in combination with hepatic resection of primary and metastatic liver tumors. Materials/Methods: Sixteen patients completed hepatectomy and SRT for either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (6) or metastases from colorectal (5), neuroendocrine (2), uterine (2), or sarcoma (1) primary. Twenty-one operable metastases were resected in 5 patients and gold fiducials were placed into the unresectable lesions to facilitate definitive SRT. Three patients with initially unresectable tumors received preoperative SRT followed by R0 resection. SRT as a bridge to liver transplant was used in 4 patients with HCC. Four patients had salvage SRT for recurrence after surgery. All patients completed 4D-CT and 3DSPECT/ CT to define functional normal liver volume (NLV) for SRT planning. MV-fluoro was performed to confirm tumor/fiducial respiratory motion within the PTV. In retrospect, our patient's treatment planning, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were reviewed under an IRB approved outcomes study. Toxicity was graded according to CTCAE v3.0. Result(s): All patients successfully completed a combination of hepatectomy and SRT. Forty lesions were treated with hepatectomy and 20 (<= 3 per patient) received SRT with a mean PTV of 132.6 cc (range, - 9.7- 803.5). The mean dose was 47.7 Gy (range, - 36-60) prescribed to the PTV in 5-16 fractions. With median follow-up of 17.7 months (range, - 5.8-32.1), 2 patients had grade 3 elevation of Total Bilirubin prior to initiation of SRT which persisted through treatment. No incidence of > grade 1 radiation-induced liver disease was observed. The most common clinical toxicity was Grade <= 2 fatigue. No patients had grade > 2 clinical toxicity. As a group, functional NLVs defined on 3D-SPECT/CT were significantly reduced compared to liver volumes defined on CT and estimated from the Body Surface Area equation (p = 0.037 and p = 0.0012 respectively). Postoperative morbidity was <= Grade 1. On followup imaging, no in-field failures have occurred. A total of 18.7% of the patients have had a failure elsewhere in the liver. Overall survival was 75% with 4 deaths, 2 of which were from liver failure and 2 from progressive systemic disease. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary study indicates that combination of liver SRT with hepatic resection is safe and effective. It can be used preoperatively to increase resectability or postoperatively to salvage surgical failures. It can also be used to target unresectable metastases in combination with limited hepatectomies for resectable peripheral lesions thereby expanding indications for curative treatment.

The mean follow-up is 5 years. The survival curves do not differ significantly (P=0.25) between the two groups. The 4-year overall survival rate (95% confidence interval) is 22% [15-32%] in the PCI group versus 16% [10-25%] in the control group. The relative risk of death in the PCI group compared to the control group is 0.84 (95% CI=[0.62-1.13]). The incidence of brain metastasis is lower in the PCI group, but the difference is not statistically significant (P=0.14). The 4-year cumulative rate of brain metastasis is 44% [32-57%] in the PCI group compared to 51% [38-63%] in the control group. In conclusion, in this study, which had to be closed prematurely, no significant difference was found in terms of the incidence of brain metastases nor in survival.

PURPOSE: To explore the mechanism of facial nerve recovery after radiotherapy by simulating surgical treatment of parotid gland carcinoma with reserving facial nerve and studying the ability of aerobic metabolism, transmission of neurotransmitter, variation of ultrastructure of motor end and mitochondrion after radiotherapy during operation. METHOD(S): Animal models of treatment group(15Gy) and lethal dose group(17Gy) were established. Succinic dehydrogenase(SDH) and acetylcholine lipase(AchE) of orbicularis oris were measured after radiotherapy. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. RESULT(S): The activity of SDH and AchE declined after radiotherapy. There was significant difference between treatment group and lethal dose group. One month later, there was a significant improvement in the activity of SDH and AchE in treatment group, while that of lethal dose group continued to decline. CONCLUSION(S): After radiotherapy during parotid gland surgery, the activity of SDH and AchE, transmission of neurotransmitter, and the ability of aerobic metabolism decreased. The ultrastructure of motor end and mitochondrion was destroyed. The variation returned to preoperative levels in treatment group, while did not in lethal dose group.",Included
1737,"Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for the Management of Liver Metastases from Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: A Preliminary Study. INTRODUCTION: Liver metastases are common in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms. The role of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is not well understood in this population. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SABR in treating well-differentiated neuroendocrine liver metastases (WD-NELM). METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients with WD-NELM treated with SABR between January 2015-July 2019. Demographic, treatment and clinical/radiographic follow-up data were abstracted. RECIST 1.1 criteria were applied to each individual target to evaluate the response to treatment. Local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) were determined using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Toxicity was reported according to CTCAE v5.0. RESULT(S): Twenty-five patients with a total of 53 liver metastases treated with SABR were identified. Most patients (68%) had midgut tumors, were Grade II (80%) and had high volume intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic disease (76%). Median number of liver metastases treated was 2 with a median size of 2.5 cm. Median radiation dose delivered was 50Gy/5 fractions. Median follow-up was 14 months; 24 of the 25 patients were alive at time of analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was 32%, with improvement or stability in 96% of lesions treated. The median time to best response was 9 months. The 1-year LC and PFS were 92% and 44% respectively. No Grade III/IV acute or late toxicity was identified. CONCLUSION(S): Liver SABR is a safe and promising means of providing local control for WD-NELM. This treatment modality should be evaluated in select patients in concert with strategies to manage systemic disease. Copyright © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
1940,"Opposite effects of WR-2721 and WR-1065 on radiation-induced hypothermia: possible correlation with oxygen uptake. Ionizing radiation induces hypothermia in guinea pigs. While systemic injection of the radioprotectant S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721) did not block hyperthermia induced by exposure to 10 Gy of gamma radiation, central administration did attenuate it. The dephosphorylated metabolite of WR-2721, N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,3-diaminopropane (WR-1065), accentuated radiation-induced hypothermia by both routes of administration. In brain homogenates, oxygen uptake was inhibited by WR-2721 but elevated by WR-1065. These results suggest that the antagonism of radiation-induced hypothermia found only after central administration of WR-2721 is due to its direct actions and not to its dephosphorylated metabolite and that this effect may be correlated with the inhibition by WR-2721 of oxygen uptake.",Included
1946,"Diffusion tensor imaging of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus and the cerebrospinal fluid tap test. Objectives: Damaged neural tracts contribute to the symptomatology of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (INPH). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to microstructural changes in white matter not always detectable with ordinary MRI. We evaluated relationships between DTI parameters and clinical profiles in INPH patients, along with differences in these DTI measures between CSF tap test (CSFTT) responders and non-responders. Method(s): Fifty-four INPH patients (26 CSFTT responders and 28 CSFTT non-responders) constituted the final group for analysis. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were assessed using atlas-based tract mapping methods for 12 different fiber tracts. Result(s): CSFTT non-responders, when compared to responders, showed lower FA values in the left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and left cingulum-hippocampus (CgH). The associations between clinical symptoms of INPH and DTI measures were most commonly found in the CgH. Higher MD in the CgH correlated with poorer cognitive performance. Higher MD in the right CgH also correlated with gait or motor dysfunction. Lower FA in the right CgH was correlated with urinary disturbance and cognitive impairment. Lower FA values in the corticospinal tract (CST) and right ATR significantly correlated with poorer cognitive performance, and correlated with gait dysfunction. Higher MD in left CST correlated with cognitive impairment. Conclusion(s): Our findings may suggest a possibility for considering microstructural changes in white matter in ventriculomegaly patients as potential imaging markers for the prediction of CSFTT responders. We suppose that DTI parameters may help to assess cognitive dysfunction, gait, and motor deterioration in INPH, along with urinary disturbance.",Excluded
1390,"Superficial anatomy of the neonatal cerebrum - an ultrasonographic roadmap. Neurosonography is an essential imaging modality for assessing the neonatal brain, particularly as a screening tool to evaluate intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus and periventricular leukomalacia. The primary advantages of neurosonography include portability, accessibility and lack of ionizing radiation. Its main limitations are intrinsic operator dependence and the need for an open fontanelle. Neurosonographic imaging acquisition is typically performed by placing a sector transducer over the anterior fontanelle and following sagittal and coronal sweeps. The sensitivity of neurosonography has markedly improved thanks to the adoption of modern imaging equipment, the use of dedicated head probes, and the employment of advanced diagnostic US techniques. These developments have facilitated more descriptive identification of specific cerebral anatomical details, improving understanding of the cerebral anatomy by conventional US. Such knowledge is fundamental for enhanced diagnostic sensitivity and is a key to understanding pathological states. Furthermore, familiarity with normal anatomy is crucial for understanding pathological states. Our primary goal in this review was to supplement these technological developments with a roadmap to the cerebral landscape. We accomplish this by presenting a systematic approach to using routine US for consistent identification of the most crucial cerebral landmarks, reviewing their relationship with adjacent structures, and briefly describing their primary function.",Excluded
1486,"Dosimetric analyses of kidneys, liver, spleen, pituitary gland, and neuroendocrine tumors of patients treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to calculate the radiation absorbed dose to kidneys, liver, spleen, pituitary gland, and neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of patients treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. METHOD(S): We enrolled 61 patients (male/female patients, 40/21) with mean age of 48.1 +/- 15.3 years affected by different types of NETs diagnosed with Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT and biochemical markers. For radiation protection of kidneys, amino acid mixture (lysine and arginine) was coinfused; 3.7 to 7.4 GBq (100-200 mCi) of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE was infused to each patient over 30 minutes. Each patient underwent a series of 9 whole-body scans at 30 minutes (prevoid) and 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, and 168 h. The organs included in dosimetric calculation were kidney, liver, spleen, pituitary gland, and NETs. All dosimetric calculations were done using the OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software. RESULT(S): Physiological uptake of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE was seen in all patients in kidneys, liver, spleen, and pituitary gland. Radiation absorbed doses were calculated: 0.57 +/- 0.09 mGy/MBq for kidneys, 0.27 +/- 0.05 mGy/MBq for liver, 1.17 +/- 0.14 mGy/MBq for spleen, 0.058 +/- 0.011 mGy/MBq for pituitary gland, and 3.41 +/- 0.68 mGy/MBq for NETs. CONCLUSION(S): The maximum cumulative activity of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE that can be safely administered to a patient within permissible renal threshold in our study was found to be 40 GBq (1100 mCi). However, there are considerable interpatient differences in absorbed doses of all organs requiring individualized dosimetry for optimizing tumor dose.",Excluded
2351,"[Radiotherapy for brain metastases]. Radiotherapy for brain metastases has become more multifaceted. Indeed, with the improvement of the patient's life expectancy, side effects must be undeniably avoided and the retreatments or multiple treatments are common. The cognitive side effects should be warned and the most modern techniques of radiation therapy are used regularly to reach this goal. The new classifications of patients with brain metastases help guiding treatment more appropriately. Stereotactic radiotherapy has supplanted whole brain radiation therapy both for patients with metastases in place and for those who underwent surgery. Hippocampus protection is possible with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Its relevance in terms of cognitive functioning should be more clearly demonstrated but the requirement, for using it, is increasingly strong. While addressing patients in palliative phase, the treatment of brain metastases is one of the localisations where technical thinking is the most challenging.",Excluded
2207,"The effect of rowing ergometry and resistive exercise on skeletal muscle structure and function during bed rest. Exposure to microgravity causes functional and structural impairment of skeletal muscle. Current exercise regimens are time-consuming and insufficiently effective; an integrated countermeasure is needed that addresses musculoskeletal along with cardiovascular health. High-intensity, short-duration rowing ergometry and supplemental resistive strength exercise may achieve these goals. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers completed 5 wk of head-down-tilt bed rest (HDBR): 18 were randomized to exercise, 9 remained sedentary. Exercise consisted of rowing ergometry 6 days/wk, including interval training, and supplemental strength training 2 days/wk. Measurements before and after HDBR and following reambulation included assessment of strength, skeletal muscle volume (MRI), and muscle metabolism (magnetic resonance spectroscopy); quadriceps muscle biopsies were obtained to assess muscle fiber types, capillarization, and oxidative capacity. Sedentary bed rest (BR) led to decreased muscle volume (quadriceps: -9 +/- 4%, P < 0.001; plantar flexors: -19 +/- 6%, P < 0.001). Exercise (ExBR) reduced atrophy in the quadriceps (-5 +/- 4%, interaction P = 0.018) and calf muscle, although to a lesser degree (-14 +/- 6%, interaction P = 0.076). Knee extensor and plantar flexor strength was impaired by BR (-14 +/- 15%, P = 0.014 and -22 +/- 7%, P = 0.001) but preserved by ExBR (-4 +/- 13%, P = 0.238 and +13 +/- 28%, P = 0.011). Metabolic capacity, as assessed by maximal O2 consumption, (31)P-MRS, and oxidative chain enzyme activity, was impaired in BR but stable or improved in ExBR. Reambulation reversed the negative impact of BR. High-intensity, short-duration rowing and supplemental strength training effectively preserved skeletal muscle function and structure while partially preventing atrophy in key antigravity muscles. Due to its integrated cardiovascular benefits, rowing ergometry could be a primary component of exercise prescriptions for astronauts or patients suffering from severe deconditioning.",Excluded
1808,"High linear energy transfer carbon radiation effectively kills cultured glioma cells with either mutant or wild-type p53. PURPOSE: A mutation in the p53 gene is believed to play an important role in the radioresistance of many cancer cell lines. We studied cytotoxic effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon beams on glioma cell lines with either mutant or wild-type p53.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cell lines U-87 and U-138 expressing wild-type p53 and U-251 and U-373 expressing mutant p53 were used. These cells were irradiated with 290 MeV/u carbon beams generated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in the National Institute of Radiologic Science or X-rays. A standard colony-forming assay and flow cytometric detection of apoptosis were performed. Cell cycle progression and the expression of p53, p21, and bax proteins were examined.RESULTS: High LET carbon radiation was more cytotoxic than low LET X-ray treatment against glioma cells. The effects of the carbon beams were not dependent on the p53 gene status but were reduced by G(1) arrest, which was independent of p21 expression. The expression of bax remained unchanged in all four cell lines.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that high LET charged particle radiation can induce cell death in glioma cells more effectively than X-rays and that cell death other than p53-dependent apoptosis may participate in the cytotoxicity of heavy charged particles. Thus, it might prove to be an effective alternative radiotherapy for patients with gliomas harboring mutated p53 gene.",Excluded

2097,"Monte Carlo-based dose reconstruction in a rat model for scattered ionizing radiation investigations. PURPOSE: In radiation biology, rats are often irradiated, but the precise dose distributions are often lacking, particularly in areas that receive scatter radiation. We used a non-dedicated set of resources to calculate detailed dose distributions, including doses to peripheral organs well outside of the primary field, in common rat exposure settings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a detailed dose reconstruction in a rat through an analog to the conventional human treatment planning process. The process consisted of: (i) Characterizing source properties of an X-ray irradiator system, (ii) acquiring a computed tomography (CT) scan of a rat model, and (iii) using a Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine to generate the dose distribution within the rat model. We considered cranial and liver irradiation scenarios where the rest of the body was protected by a lead shield. Organs of interest were the brain, liver and gonads. The study also included paired scenarios where the dose to adjacent, shielded rats was determined as a potential control for analysis of bystander effects.RESULTS: We established the precise doses and dose distributions delivered to the peripheral organs in single and paired rats. Mean doses to non-targeted organs in irradiated rats ranged from 0.03-0.1% of the reference platform dose. Mean doses to the adjacent rat peripheral organs were consistent to within 10% those of the directly irradiated rat.CONCLUSIONS: This work provided details of dose distributions in rat models under common irradiation conditions and established an effective scenario for delivering only scattered radiation consistent with that in a directly irradiated rat.",Excluded
