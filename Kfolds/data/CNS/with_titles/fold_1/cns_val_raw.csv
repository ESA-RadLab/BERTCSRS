1358,"Pseudo-aneurysm of the carotid bifurcation secondary to radiation Pseudoaneurysms of the extracranial carotid vessels have a varied etiopathogenesis. Cases have been attributed to spontaneous rupture, following tonsillectomy or peritonsillar abscesses, trauma, postanastamotic and, rarely, postirradiation, and ECMO. The authors present a case of a pseudoaneurysm involving the carotid artery bifurcation following radiation therapy. A saphenous vein graft was used to establish continuity between the common and the internal carotid arteries. A vascular shunt was used to maintain cerebral perfusion during surgery. This case highlights the technical difficulties encountered in correcting this condition. This case exemplifies the technical difficulties that are encountered in a complicated case such as this. Numerous previous operations and radiotherapy compounded the hazards of the surgical procedure. Although technically challenging, every attempt must be made to resect pseudoaneurysms caused by radiation induced vascular damage.",Excluded
1724,"Redox balance- and radiation-mediated alteration in hippocampal neurogenesis Changes in the intracellular and extracellular redox balance have been correlated with cell fate decisions in terms of proliferation versus differentiation, entering versus existing cell cycle and survival versus cell death. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been correlated with neuronal plasticity of learning and memory; however, the process is exquisitely sensitive to changes in redox balance. Cranial irradiation is an effective modality in treating brain tumours but often leads to deficits in hippocampus-related learning and memory, which is most likely due to sustained elevation of oxygen free radical production and suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. The subcellular redox environment affecting hippocampal neurogenesis is largely unknown. Using mutant mice deficient in each one of the three superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) isoforms, we have begun to determine the consequences of SOD deficiency in hippocampal neurogenesis and the related functions of learning and memory under normal condition and following cranial irradiation.",Excluded
1863,"Focused ultrasound enhanced intranasal delivery of brain derived neurotrophic factor produces neurorestorative effects in a Parkinson's disease mouse model Focused ultrasound-enhanced intranasal (IN + FUS) delivery is a noninvasive approach that utilizes the olfactory pathway to administer pharmacological agents directly to the brain, allowing for a more homogenous distribution in targeted locations compared to IN delivery alone. However, whether such a strategy has therapeutic values, especially in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), remains to be established. Herein, we evaluated whether the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine catalysis, could be enhanced by IN + FUS delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a toxin-based PD mouse model. Mice were put on the subacute dosing regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), producing bilateral degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway consistent with early-stage PD. MPTP mice then received BDNF intranasally followed by multiple unilateral FUS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings in the left basal ganglia for three consecutive weeks. Subsequently, mice were survived for two months and were evaluated morphologically and behaviorally to determine the integrity of their nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Mice receiving IN + FUS had significantly increased TH immunoreactivity in the treated hemisphere compared to the untreated hemisphere while mice receiving only FUS-induced BBB opening or no treatment at all did not show any differences. Additionally, behavioral changes were only observed in the IN + FUS treated mice, indicating improved motor control function in the treated hemisphere. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the method and potential of IN + FUS for the delivery of bioactive factors for treatment of neurodegenerative disorder.",Excluded
2042,"The Role of Advanced Imaging in Assessing Response to Definitive Chemoradiation Before Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer We examined the responses to chemoradiation according to imaging modality in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Provided patients achieved at least a partial response, advanced imaging response neither affected survival nor added information to the decision to offer prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), suggesting that limited-stage SCLC patients with partial response using any imaging modality should not be denied PCI. Introduction: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) improves survival for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Evidence for PCI in limited-stage SCLC largely derives from studies requiring only chest x-ray (CXR) to determine remission status. We analyzed thoracic chemoradiation therapy (TCRT) outcomes according to imaging modality to determine which patients benefitted most from PCI. Patients and Methods: All limited-stage SCLC patients who received TCRT as well as PCI at our institution were reviewed. Imaging between TCRT end and PCI start was characterized as complete (CR), partial (PR), or other response. Result(s): Thirty-eight consecutive patients were assessed for TCRT response before PCI with CXR (n = 21), chest computed tomography (CT; n = 27), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (n = 11). CR was identified on 71% of CXRs, 41% of CT scans, and 18% of PET/CT scans. Median survival was 28.3 months for the entire cohort and did not differ for patients who had CXR alone versus CT and/or PET/CT for restaging (P =.78) or those with PR using any modality versus CR using all modalities (22.6 months vs. 45.5 months; P =.22). CT CR patients had numerical but not statistically significant improved 2-year (P =.18) and 3-year (P =.13) survival compared with CT PR. Conclusion(s): CXR remains an appropriate modality to assess TCRT response before PCI in limited-stage SCLC. Advanced imaging did not inform the decision to offer PCI in this study. Because of similar excellent survival profiles independent of imaging modality and TCRT response, this analysis suggests limited-stage SCLC patients with PR using any modality should not be denied PCI, akin to standards for extensive-stage SCLC.

1731,"New forms of radionuclide therapy with <sup>90</sup>Y in oncology Background: Currently, there is growing interest in the use of the beta emitter <sup>90</sup>Y in systemic therapy in oncology. For successful therapy, an appropriate ligand is chosen to carry the isotope to the place of its action. As well as performing this function, the type of the ligand influences both the course and the side effects of the treatment. For RIT of lymphomas, bone marrow becomes the critical organ; in NET patients treated with labelled somatostatin analogues, increased kidney irradiation can occur. The aim of this study was to evaluate the side effects of therapy using <sup>90</sup>Y associated with different ligands, depending on the charge to critical organs after treatment in two groups of patients: those with neuroendocrine tumours and those with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Material(s) and Method(s): 32 patients with histopathologically confirmed NET treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq/m<sup>2</sup> cumulative dose) and 30 NHL patients treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (1200 MBq max dose) were enrolled in the study. The kidney function and changes of blood indices were assessed during the course of the therapy. Result(s): 59% of NET patients treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATATE displayed transient reduction of blood indices, the largest after cycles III and IV of therapy. After 5 months an increase in creatinine level was noticed, but no statistically important changes in creatinine level and GFR were observed. In the group of patients with NHL, the change of haematological indices after RIT concerned mainly PLT, ANC and WBC. The reduction of the average PLT and WBC values started in the first weeks after the treatment application, reaching nadir in the 6th week and 8th week, respectively. No life threatening infections were observed in either group of patients. Conclusion(s): After treatment with the use of the <sup>90</sup>Y radionuclide, no significant treatment toxicity, including disorders involving the critical organs for both types of therapies, was found in the groups of neuroendocrine tumour and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.

1887,"Simulation of reflected light intensity changes during navigation and radio-frequency lesioning in the brain An electrode with adjacent optical fibers for measurements during navigation and radio frequency lesioning in the brain is modeled for Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in brain tissue. Relative reflected light intensity at 780 nm, I780, from this electrode and probes with identical fiber configuration are simulated using the intensity from native white matter as reference. Models are made of homogeneous native and coagulated gray, thalamus, and white matter as well as blood. Dual layer models, including models with a layer of cerebrospinal fluid between the fibers and the brain tissue, are also made. Simulated I780 was 0.16 for gray matter, 0.67 for coagulate gray matter, 0.36 for thalamus, 0.39 for coagulated thalamus, unity for white matter, 0.70 for coagulated white matter, and 0.24 for blood. Thalamic matter is also found to reflect more light than gray matter and less than white matter in clinical studies. In conclusion, the reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between gray and white matter during navigation. Furthermore, coagulation of light gray tissue, such as the thalamus, might be difficult to detect using I780, but coagulation in darker gray tissue should result in a rapid increase of I780.",Excluded

1219,"[Isotopic cisternography in detection of CSF Rhinorrhea (author's transl)] The radioisotope cisternogram has proven itself to be a valuable diagnostic procedure during the evaluation of patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. If it is not possible to define the origin of such a leak, extensive intracranial explorations may be required, which may or may not result in successful correction of the defect. As a functional examination with limited risk to the patient and minimal radiation exposure, the isotopic cisternogram can either establish a diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea or eliminate cerebrospinal fluid as a cause for rhinorrhea. When occurring, CSF leaks can be shown by demonstrating a ""path"" from the cranial fossage into the nasal cavity. The present technique utilizes tampons placed in each nostril. A positive diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea is made by finding a tampon impregnated with at least twice the radioactivity of a control tampon from the opposite nostril (in the presence of an intact septum). Conclusions indicate that a positive anterior fossa cisternogram may be the only evidence for hidden site of CSF leakage, especially when other signs are lacking.",Excluded
1307,"Descending modulation of pain Although interest in descending modulation of spinal cord function dates back to the time of Sherrington, the modern era began in the late 1960s when it was shown that focal electrical stimulation in the midbrain of the rat produced analgesia sufficient to permit surgery. From this report evolved the concept of endogenous systems of pain modulation. Initial interest focused on descending inhibition of spinal nociceptive processing, but we now know that descending modulation of spinal nociceptive processing can be either inhibitory or facilitatory. As our understanding of descending facilitatory, or pro-nociceptive influences grows, so too has our appreciation of its potential importance. Accumulating evidence suggests that descending facilitatory influences may contribute to the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia and thus contribute to chronic pain states.

1527,"Interleukin-6 primarily produced by non-hematopoietic cells mediates the lipopolysaccharide-induced febrile response Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is critical for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced febrile response. However, the exact source(s) of IL-6 involved in regulating the LPS-elicited fever is still to be identified. One known source of IL-6 is hematopoietic cells, such as monocytes. To clarify the contribution of hematopoietically derived IL-6 to fever, we created chimeric mice expressing IL-6 selectively either in cells of hematopoietic or, conversely, in cells of non-hematopoietic origin. This was performed by extinguishing hematopoietic cells in wild-type (WT) or IL-6 knockout (IL-6 KO) mice by whole-body irradiation and transplanting them with new stem cells. Mice on a WT background but lacking IL-6 in hematopoietic cells displayed normal fever to LPS and were found to have similar levels of IL-6 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in plasma and of IL-6 mRNA in the brain as WT mice. In contrast, mice on an IL-6 KO background, but with intact IL-6 production in cells of hematopoietic origin, only showed a minor elevation of the body temperature after peripheral LPS injection. While they displayed significantly elevated levels of IL-6 both in plasma and CSF compared with control mice, the increase was modest compared with that seen in LPS injected mice on a WT background, the latter being approximately 20 times larger in magnitude. These results suggest that IL-6 of non-hematopoietic origin is the main source of IL-6 in LPS-induced fever, and that IL-6 produced by hematopoietic cells only plays a minor role.",Excluded
1632,"Environmental toxicology: Sensitive periods of development and neurodevelopmental disorders Development of the mammalian central nervous system is a complex process whose disruption may have severe and long-lasting consequences upon brain structure and function, potentially resulting in a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Many NDDs are known to be genetic in origin, with symptom onset and their underlying mechanisms now known to be regulated during time-dependent windows or 'critical periods' during normal brain development. However, it is increasingly evident that similar disturbances to the developing nervous system may be caused by exposure to non-genetic, environmental factors. Strikingly, at least 200 industrially applied or produced chemicals have been associated with neurotoxicity in humans and exposure to these modifying compounds, through consumer products or environmental pollution, therefore poses serious threats to public health. Through a combination of human epidemiological and animal experimental studies, we identified developmental periods for increased vulnerability to environmentally-modifying compounds and determined whether and how exposure during specific sensitive time-windows could increase the risk for the NDDs of autism, ADHD or schizophrenia in the developing organism. We report that many environmental toxicants have distinct sensitive time-windows during which exposure may disrupt critical developmental events, thereby increasing the risk of developing NDDs. The majority of these time-windows occur prenatally rather than postnatally. We propose four underlying mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, immune system dysregulation, altered neurotransmission and thyroid hormone disruption. Given the complexity of underlying mechanisms and their prenatal inception, treatment options are currently limited. Thus, we conclude that preventing early exposure to environmental toxicants, by increasing public awareness and improving government and industry guidelines, may ultimately lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of NDDs.

1846,"Feasibility of setting up generic alert levels for maximum skin dose in fluoroscopically guided procedures Purpose: The feasibility of setting-up generic, hospital-independent dose alert levels to initiate vigilance on possible skin injuries in interventional procedures was studied for three high-dose procedures (chemoembolization (TACE) of the liver, neuro-embolization (NE) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) in 9 European countries. Method(s): Gafchromic films and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used to determine the Maximum Skin Dose (MSD). Correlation of the online dose indicators (fluoroscopy time, kerma- or dose-area product (KAP or DAP) and cumulative air kerma at interventional reference point (K<inf>a,r</inf>)) with MSD was evaluated and used to establish the alert levels corresponding to a MSD of 2 Gy and 5 Gy. The uncertainties of alert levels in terms of DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf>, and uncertainty of MSD were calculated. Result(s): About 20-30% of all MSD values exceeded 2 Gy while only 2-6% exceeded 5 Gy. The correlations suggest that both DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf> can be used as a dose indicator for alert levels (Pearson correlation coefficient p mostly >0.8), while fluoroscopy time is not suitable (p mostly <0.6). Generic alert levels based on DAP (Gy cm<sup>2</sup>) were suggested for MSD of both 2 Gy and 5 Gy (for 5 Gy: TACE 750, PCI 250 and NE 400). The suggested levels are close to the lowest values published in several other studies. The uncertainty of the MSD was estimated to be around 10-15% and of hospital-specific skin dose alert levels about 20-30% (with coverage factor k = 1). Conclusion(s): The generic alert levels are feasible for some cases but should be used with caution, only as the first approximation, while hospital-specific alert levels are preferred as the final approach.

1800,"[Evaluation of cerebral blood perfusion with IVR-CT/angio system during interventional procedures] An interventional-radiology computed-tomography (IVR-CT)/angio system is a combination of an angiographic unit and a CT scanner. This system allows patient's movement in and out of the two imaging units, on the same table. Since June 2003, we have applied our conventional protocol for evaluation of cerebral blood perfusion during interventional radiology (IVR) procedures. We reviewed our experience using the IVR-CT/angio system and investigated the efficacy and limitations of this technique. No complications relating to radiation exposure, contrast medium use, or IVR procedures were observed. CT perfusion was useful for detecting cerebral perfusion impairment during IVR procedures. This was helpful in deciding the postoperative management. Because patients do not need to be transported to another radiographic suite to evaluate cerebral blood perfusion, the IVR-CT/angio system is ideal for safely and simply detecting cerebral perfusion defects during IVR procedures. However, it is important to consider whether there is sufficient indication for the procedure, because radiation exposure and the amount of contrast medium use are increased if the IVR procedures become difficult.",Excluded
1271,"Effect of hypoxia on hyperpolarization-activated current in mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons The properties of hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and the effect of hypoxia on the current have been studied using whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Under voltage-clamp mode, I(h), blocked by 1 mM extracellular CsCl, was present in 75.5% of mouse DRG neurons. The distribution rate increased as the neurons become larger, 5.3%, 79.8% and 94.2% in small, medium and large neurons, respectively. Both I(h) density and the rate of I(h) activation increased in response to more hyperpolarized potential. The activation of I(h) current in larger neuron was faster than in smaller neuron, there was a significant correlation between the time constant of I(h) activation and neuron's size. However, I(h) density did not show any correlation with neuron's size. Under current-clamp mode, 'depolarizing sag' was observed in all neurons with I(h) current. The reversal potential (V(rev)) and the maximal conductance density of I(h) (G(h.max-density)) were -31.0 +/- 4.8 mV and 0.17 +/- 0.02 nS/pF, with a half-activated potential (V(0.5) = -99.4 +/- 1.1 mV) and a slope factor (kappa = -10.2 +/- 0.3 mV). There was a correlation between neuron's size and G(h.max-density) only. According to the effect of hypoxia on resting membrane potential, there were hypoxia-sensitive and hypoxia-insensitive neurons. In the hypoxia-sensitive neurons, I(h) was fully abolished by hypoxia, although the resting membrane potential was hyperpolarized. V(0.5) and V(rev) were shifted about 30 mV toward hyperpolarization, whereas G(h.max-density) and kappa were not affected by hypoxia. We suggest that the kinetics and voltage-dependent characteristics of I(h) are varied in mouse DRG neurons with different size. Hypoxia inhibits I(h) in the hypoxia-sensitive neurons by shifting its activation potential to a more hyperpolarized level.",Excluded
2408,"Long-term outcomes of surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiation therapy for treatment of spinal ependymoma: A retrospective multicenter study by the Korea Spinal Oncology Research Group Background: We sought to determine the surgical treatment and functional outcome and identify the predictors of survival in a retrospective cohort of patients with spinal cord ependymoma using data collected from the Korea Spinal Oncology Research Group database. Method(s): The data regarding 88 patients who had been surgically treated for histologically confirmed spinal cord intramedullary and extramedullary ependymoma from January 1989 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Histopathological examination revealed myxopapillary ependymoma in 24 patients, ependymoma in 61 patients, and anaplastic ependymoma in 3 patients. Gross total removal was achieved in 72 patients, subtotal removal in 15 patients, and partial removal in 1 patient. Twenty patients were treated with postoperative radiation. Fifty-two patients had stable or improved postoperative neurological function, while 36 experienced neurological deterioration. A permanent decrease in McCormick classification grade was seen in 17 patients. The progression-free survival rate was 87% for all patients at 5 years and 80% at 10 years. During follow-up, local recurrence/progression was seen in 13 patients. Diffuse meningeal spread developed in 2 anaplastic ependymoma patients. Postoperative radiotherapy after incomplete resection did not significantly correlate with longer times to recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed histology and surgical extent of resection as independent predictors of longer progression-free survival. Conclusion(s): Gross total removal alone is a good treatment strategy for spinal ependymomas. Early diagnosis and surgery, before severe paralysis, are important to obtain good functional outcomes. Subtotal resection with radiation therapy for intramedullary lesions appears to offer no advantages over gross total removal. © 2013 The Author(s).",Included
1623,"The influence of mineralising radionecrosis on the dose distribution in interstitial radiation therapy of brain tumours The influences of radionecroses arising during interstitial radiation of brain tumours with 125I, 192Ir or 198Au on dose distribution was investigated using Monte Carlo methods. The necroses have a higher density than normal tissue due to radiation-induced changes in tissue composition as well as mineral deposits. They can have a diameter of up to 1 cm around the single seeds. The higher density and changed chemical composition compared to homogeneous normal tissue leads to increased absorption of radiation around the necroses which results in a lower dose rate in the surrounding tissue. It is shown that the formation of necroses during treatment with higher energy radiation such as 192Ir (340 keV) or 198Au (400 keV) may be neglected during therapy planning as the dose rate is affected by less than 2%. If low energy radiation, e.g. 125I (28 keV) is used, the dose rate can be reduced by more than 30%. In this case the influence of the necroses on dose distribution, at least for permanent 125I implantation, may not be negligible.",Excluded

The analysis of the reactant and product molecular structures reveals the energy storage mechanism as determined by the detailed molecular rearrangements of the retinyl chromophore, including rotation of the (C11-C12) dihedral angle from -11 degrees in the 11-cis isomer to -161 degrees in the all-trans product, where the preferential sense of rotation is determined by the steric interactions between Ala-117 and the polyene chain at the C13 position, torsion of the polyene chain due to steric constraints in the binding pocket, and stretching of the salt bridge between the protonated Schiff base and the Glu-113 counterion by reorientation of the polarized bonds that localize the net positive charge at the Schiff-base linkage.

1330,"CyberKnife frameless single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery for tumors of the sacrum OBJECT: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial lesions is well established. The experience with radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal and sacral lesions is more limited. Sacral lesions should be amenable to radiosurgical treatment similar to that used for their intracranial counterparts. The authors evaluated a single- fraction radiosurgical technique performed using the CyberKnife Real-Time Image-Guided Radiosurgery System for the treatment of the sacral lesion. METHOD(S): The CyberKnife is a frameless radiosurgery system based on the coupling of an orthogonal pair of x-ray cameras to a dynamically manipulated robot-mounted linear accelerator possessing six degrees of freedom, which guides the therapy beam to the intended target without the need for frame-based fixation. All sacral lesions were located and tracked for radiation delivery relative to fiducial bone markers placed percutaneously. Eighteen patients were treated with single-fraction radiosurgery. Tumor histology included one benign and 17 malignant tumors. Dose plans were calculated based on computerized tomography scans acquired using 1.25-mm slices. Planning treatment volume was defined as the radiographically documented tumor volume with no margin. Tumor dose was maintained at 12 to 20 Gy to the 80% isodose line (mean 15 Gy). Tumor volume ranged from 23.6 to 187.4 ml (mean 90 ml). The volume of the cauda equina receiving greater than 8 Gy ranged from 0 to 1 ml (mean 0.1 ml). All patients underwent the procedure in an outpatient setting. No acute radiation toxicity or new neurological deficits occurred during the mean follow-up period of 6 months. Pain improved in all 13 patients who were symptomatic prior to treatment. No tumor progression has been documented on follow-up imaging. CONCLUSION(S): Stereotactic radiosurgery was found to be feasible, safe, and effective for the treatment of both benign and malignant sacral lesions. The major potential benefits of radiosurgical ablation of sacral lesions are relatively short treatment time in an outpatient setting and minimal or no side effects. This new technique offers a new and important therapeutic modality for the primary treatment of a variety of sacral tumors or for lesions not amenable to open surgical techniques.",Excluded

Results of splenic irradiation in patients with myelofibrosis or chronic leukemia were retrospectively analyzed.PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 24 patients: 15 presented with MF and 9 with CML. Median irradiation doses were 9.8 and 7.7 Gy, respectively. The hematologic toxicity was moderate (except for platelets in the acute phase of the disease).RESULTS: No toxicity was observed. Various factors predictive of the response to radiation therapy are described. While high (around 14 Gy) radiation therapy dose appears necessary for MF and should be started before the increase in transfusion need, huge splenomegalies should be excluded in regard to CML. As for other cases, the optimal dose is still unclear, but should probably be high enough, ie, around 10 Gy.CONCLUSION: To further study and better understand biological mechanisms underlying response to radiotherapy in patients with MF, prospective radio-chemotherapy phase II trials should be conducted in both CML and MF patients.",Excluded

However, since this discovery was made there has been no definitive explanation of the rapid eye movements Many possible explanations have been offered, and yet, the causes and contributing factors of the REM sleep phase are inadequately understood. It has often been proposed that the eyes observe the images produced during dreams, but researchers are not convinced. It is proposed here that the movements of the eyes during REM sleep are due to a feeling of disorientation and a subjective loss of landmarks. During the REM sleep phase, the brain has a reduced sensation of gravity, and the sleeper is in a state similar to weightlessness. The instinctive search for the vertical or horizontal direction triggers movements of the eyes, looking for usual points of reference. This hypothesis is reinforced by an original experiment that was conducted in space. The frequency of the eye movements of astronauts during their first night in space is 10 times more than what is experienced on the ground, and that moment in time is when the feeling or the sensation of weightlessness is certainly the most disturbing. Upon the return to Earth, the frequency of the eye movements increases again the first night after landing. These two moments are when the effects of gravity are felt most drastically. The present assumption needs to be validated experimentally and may necessitate further research.",Excluded
2341,"Allopurinol for refractory aggression and self-inflicted behaviour The impairment of the purinergic system, characterized by reduced adenosinergic activity, has been implicated in the neurobiology of aggressive behaviour. Since there are no direct adenosine agonists available for human use, inhibition of purine degradation by allopurinol was conceived as a possible strategy. We report two cases of adults with refractory aggressive behaviour due to a neurological condition (one mainly with self-inflicted behaviour) with dramatic response to therapy with allopurinol, 300 mg/day p.o. These preliminary results reinforce the involvement of the purinergic system in the neurobiology of aggression, warranting further testing of allopurinol as a new treatment for aggressive and self-inflicted behaviours.",Excluded
1550,"Principles of radiotherapy of neoplastic meningosis Neoplastic meningosis can be a complication of a tumor originating in the brain or the meninges, or it can be a complication of a solid tumor elsewhere that has metastasized to the leptomeninges. The therapeutic dilemma for a radiation oncologist is that neoplastic meningosis involves the entire neuraxis and, as a consequence, ideally, the entire neuraxis should be radiated. However, delivering the necessary radiation dose to the entire neuraxis may be associated with considerable neurologic or bone marrow toxicity. Radiotherapy of neoplastic meningosis can be performed by external beam radiation or by intrathecal injection of radioactive nuclides or radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. Intrathecal radiation has the theoretical advantage that treatment is directed towards the entire neuraxis with limited irradiation outside the neuraxis. In practice, intrathecal radiation is still under investigation and subject to some limitations and toxicities. Indications and techniques for external beam radiation may range from either therapeutic or elective cranial or craniospinal radiation to palliative involved-field radiation. Patients with neoplastic meningosis are frequently treated with a combination of radiation and chemotherapy, and/or may have been irradiated to the nervous system in the past. Both are well known risk factors for radiation damage to the nervous system. In general, current treatment protocols focus on the development of combination chemotherapy programs and reduction of the radiation dose to minimize toxicity and/or to improve tumor control.",Excluded
2018,"Dynamic instability of sheared microtubules observed by quasi-elastic light scattering The kinetics of microtubule reassembly was studied in vitro by quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS). When microtubules assembled in the absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) were sheared, they rapidly depolymerized, recovered, and reassembled. The mean length of the recovered microtubules was the same as that observed just before shearing, implying that on average one fragment per original microtubule survived the fragmentation and recovery. When microtubules that contained 25 percent brain MAP were sheared, the fragments did not depolymerize extensively and the average length of the fragments decreased by a factor of 3 relative to the unsheared sample. The results support the dynamic instability model, which predicts that cellular microtubules are latently unstable structures protected on their ends by stabilizing caps.",Excluded
2105,"Radionuclide antibody-conjugates, a targeted therapy towards cancer Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is an investigational procedure which utilises monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), peptide conjugates and/or other chemical compounds. These bio-vectors are able to transport a dose of alpha particles to destroy cancer cells. Radionuclide antibody-conjugates (RACs), labelled with beta emitters, have already been used in humans. More recently, TAT has been introduced to treat oncological diseases mainly leukaemia and lymphoma. Encouraging results have also been obtained in solid neoplasms with the administration of anti-tenascin. This chimeric antibody labelled with astatine-211 was delivered in patients with recurrent brain tumours into a surgically created cavity. Conversely, a clinical trial using a standard TAT approach to treat patients with metastatic melanoma, observed the shrinkage of the solid tumour mass. This response in melanoma may lead to an alternative mechanism for TAT, called tumour-antivascular- alpha-therapy (TAVAT), and forms the basis of a novel approach to the treatment of cancer disease states. In this paper, we will concentrate mainly on the application of TAT using antibodies. In particular, an investigation into the major general features connected with the use of alpha emitters in cancer therapy will be discussed. The prospective role of TAT with RACs will also be outlined briefly, especially focussing on the most important therapeutic strategies to date based on antibodies radiolabelled with beta emitters.",Excluded

Originally found to be activated in response to occupancy of cell surface receptors for polypeptide hormones, cytokines, and growth factors, MAPK cascades were recently found to be activated by a variety of stresses including ischemia reperfusion, neuronal injury, osmotic shock, and exposure to UV irradiation. Therefore, MAPK cascades are likely to be important regulatory elements in a variety of stress responses. [References: 83]",Excluded
1522,"Effects of electrical stimulation of the glossopharyngeal nerve on cells in the nucleus of the solitary tract of the rat Electrophysiological responses to electrical stimulation of the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal (GP) nerve (which innervates taste buds on the caudal 1/3 of the tongue) were recorded from single cells in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation was delivered as single pulses (n=55), paired-pulses (n=15) and tetanic trains (n=11). NTS cells with GP-evoked responses were also tested for responsivity to taste stimuli (0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 M sucrose, 0.01 M HCl and 0.01 M quinine HCl). Fifty-five neurons were studied: 49 cells showed GP-evoked (mean latency+/-SEM=18.0+/-1.32 ms); seven of these were taste-responsive. Spontaneous rate of these cells was low (mean+/-SEM=1.4+/-0.3 spikes per second; median=0.21 spikes per second) and many cells showed no spontaneous activity. Paired-pulse stimulation of the GP nerve in 13 rats produced both paired-pulse suppression (n=11) and paired-pulse enhancement (n=4); tetanic stimulation (25 Hz, 1.0 s) produced sustained (>20 s) increases or decreases in firing rate in 7 of 11 cells tested. Histological data suggested that GP-evoked responses recorded in the most rostral NTS were likely the result of polysynaptic connections. Cells with GP-evoked responses formed a heterogeneous group in terms of their response properties and differed from cells with evoked responses to chorda tympani (CT; which innervates taste buds on the rostral 1/3 of the tongue) nerve stimulation. These differences may reflect the respective functional specializations of the GP and CT nerves.",Excluded

2136,"Spatial attention increases high-frequency gamma synchronisation in human medial visual cortex Visual information processing involves the integration of stimulus and goal-driven information, requiring neuronal communication. Gamma synchronisation is linked to neuronal communication, and is known to be modulated in visual cortex both by stimulus properties and voluntarily-directed attention. Stimulus-driven modulations of gamma activity are particularly associated with early visual areas such as V1, whereas attentional effects are generally localised to higher visual areas such as V4. The absence of a gamma increase in early visual cortex is at odds with robust attentional enhancements found with other measures of neuronal activity in this area. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to explore the effect of spatial attention on gamma activity in human early visual cortex using a highly effective gamma-inducing stimulus and strong attentional manipulation. In separate blocks, subjects tracked either a parafoveal grating patch that induced gamma activity in contralateral medial visual cortex, or a small line at fixation, effectively attending away from the gamma-inducing grating. Both items were always present, but rotated unpredictably and independently of each other. The rotating grating induced gamma synchronisation in medial visual cortex at 30-70. Hz, and in lateral visual cortex at 60-90. Hz, regardless of whether it was attended. Directing spatial attention to the grating increased gamma synchronisation in medial visual cortex, but only at 60-90. Hz. These results suggest that the generally found increase in gamma activity by spatial attention can be localised to early visual cortex in humans, and that stimulus and goal-driven modulations may be mediated at different frequencies within the gamma range. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2174,"Brachial plexus lesions in patients with cancer: 100 cases In patients with cancer, brachial plexus signs are usually caused by tumor infiltration or injury from radiation therapy (RT). We analyzed 100 cases of brachial plexopathy to determine which clinical criteria helped differentiate tumor from radiation injury. Seventy-eight patients had tumor (34 with previous RT), and 22 had radiation injury. Severe pain occurred in 80% of tumor patients but in only 19% of patients with radiation injury. The lower trunk (C7-8, T1) was involved in 72% of the tumors, and 32% also had epidural tumors. Seventy-eight percent of the radiation injuries affected the upper plexus (C5-6). Horner syndrome was more common in tumor, and lymphedema in radiation injury. The time from RT to onset of plexus symptoms, and the dose of RT, also differed. For symptoms within 1 year of RT, doses exceeding 6000 R were associated with radiation damage, whereas lower doses were associated with infiltration. Therefore, painless upper trunk lesions with lymphedema suggest radiation injury, and painful lower trunk lesions with Horner syndrome imply tumor infiltration.",Excluded
1381,"Electron beam irradiation as protection against the environmental release of recombinant molecules for biomaterials applications In biomaterials applications there exists a need to protect against the environmental release of recombinant microorganisms and transmissible genetic material and to prevent the recovery of proprietary genetic information. Irradiation technologies have long been used to eliminate microorganisms associated with spoilage and contamination and recent studies have demonstrated that moderate doses of irradiation may be used to sterilize medically important proteins without causing adverse effects in their desirable biological properties. Recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing organophosphate hydrolase (OPH, E.C. 3.1.8.1), an important enzyme for the detection and decontamination of neurotoxic pesticides and chemical warfare agents, were subjected to electron beam irradiation to gauge its effect on enzymatic activity, cell viability and DNA recoverability. Bacterial samples were irradiated at 2, 20 and 200 kGy using a 10 MeV electron source. Irradiation levels of 2 to 20 kGy were sufficient to eliminate viable cells without affecting OPH enzymatic activity. Biologically active DNA was recovered via PCR from all samples through the 20 kGy irradiation level. While DNA was not recovered from samples at the 200 kGy exposure level, protein activity was reduced by 19 to 78%, depending on the method of cell preparation. These results demonstrate that irradiation can be effective in preventing the release of recombinant organisms intended for use in biomaterials applications without eliminating enzymatic activity and suggests that further research may indicate specific conditions whereby DNA recovery can be eliminated while retaining sufficient enzymatic activity for targeted biomaterials applications.",Excluded
1540,"IBS19.02 Novel Radiotherapy Approaches in Small Cell Lung Carcinoma - Has SABR and Radionuclide Therapy Got a Role to Play? Thoracic radiotherapy has been shown in to increase overall survival when added to systemic therapy in patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and M0 stage. The dose, fractionation, treatment time and timing issues have not been fully resolved. A recent study did not show the superiority of 66Gy in 33 daily fractions over 6.5 weeks over twice-daily radiotherapy to a dose of 45 Gy in 30 fractions over 3 weeks twice daily [1]. For stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has been clearly shown to be superior to conventional fractionation [2]. Given the clear benefit seen in early stage NSCLC, it is postulated that SABR may have a role to play in early stage SCLC. A recent multi-institutional cohort study has reported favourable outcomes in this setting [3]. However, randomised data of equivalence or indeed superiority are lacking. Furthermore, questions remain as the timing and role of systemic therapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation when SABR is used in this setting. In advanced SCLC, many tumors display neuroendocrine clinical and cytological features and many SCLC tumors express somatostatin receptor and this can be imaged using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs such as <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE [4]. Given the uptake by some SCLC tumors of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE, higher doses of the tracer have been used in an attempt to provide radiolabelled radiotherapy treatment in metastatic disease in what has been described as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) [5]. This molecularly target radiotherapy is a potentially exciting therapeutic approach, but the ideal positioning of such therapy in tumors which are suitable for treatment with PRRT and the safety of PRRT with systemic therapy have yet to be determined.

Total background ionizing radiation was also significantly correlated with AD death rate in 50 states and the District of Columbia (r = 0.452, p = 0.001). Multivariate linear regression weighted by state population demonstrated that AD death rate was significantly correlated with radon background (beta= 0.169, p < 0.001), age (beta= 0.231, p < 0.001), hypertension (beta= 0.155, p < 0.001), and diabetes (beta= 0.353, p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Our findings, like other studies, suggest that ionizing radiation is a risk factor for AD. Intranasal inhalation of radon gas could subject the rhinencephalon and hippocampus to damaging radiation that initiates AD. The damage would accumulate over time, causing age to be a powerful risk factor.",Included
1820,"A prospective phase II trial of lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( LEN-DEX) in POEMS syndrome Background. POEMS syndrome is a rare form of B cell dyscrasia combining a proliferation usually of plasma cells, a polyneuropathy, osteocondensing bone lesions and multiple other clinical signs. The pathogenesis is not well understood but VEGF plays a major role. In patients with one or two sclerotic plasmacytoma and no bone marrow involvement, first line therapy should include radiation. For patients with diffuse sclerotic lesions, bone marrow involvement or absence of any bone lesion and for those who have not demonstrated stabilization of their disease 3 to 6 months after completing radiation systemic therapy is indicated, the most effective being high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Radiation of a single lesion is effective in about every other case and is accompanied by a fairly slow improvement of the neurological symptoms, often after initial worsening. ASCT seems to be accompanied by a number of important complications, in particular engraftment syndrome. Outside these 2 treatments there is no consensus therapy. Lenalidomide (LEN), a drug without serious neurological toxicity, has the advantage of being both anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic to malignant plasma cells (Richardson PG, Blood 2002;100(9):3063-7). We have recently reported a series of 20 French patients with POEMS syndrome treated by LEN with a good efficacy. We now report the first 27 patients of a prospective phase II trial using LEN + dexamethasone (LEN-DEX), 2 cycles preceding radiation or high dose treatment trying to obtain a rapid clinical response and to avoid engraftment syndrome or 9 cycles followed by 1 year LENalone in patients who cannot receive radiation or ASCT. Methods. Newly diagnosed or relapsing patients with POEMS syndrome who needed to be treated were eligible. Patients who can be treated by local radiation or intensive treatment with stem cell support receive two 28 day cycles of LEN 25 mg PO Days 1-21 and DEX 40 mg PO Days 1,8,15,22 before radiation or intensive treatment (Group 1), the other patients receive 9 cycles of the same LEN-DEX (Group 2) and then 12 cycles of continuous low dose LEN (10 mg). LEN dose was tapered to 10 mg for patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 ml/min and DEX to 20 mg for patients above 75 years of age and for those who were frail patients. Main eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome according to criteria by Dispenzieri et al (Am J Hematol 2012;87(8):804-14), an age of 18 or more, a creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min, no prior treatment with or contraindication to LEN and no uncontrolled thrombosis. Serum and plasma VEGF, serum electrophoresis, immunofixation and free light chain measurements were centrally monitored. Neurologic evaluations were performed using the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS), the Neurological Impairment Scale (NIS) and the 10 meter walk test (10MWT). The primary endpoint was evaluation of the effectiveness of LEN-DEX combination using biological responses (decrease of monoclonal protein and serum VEGF level) and secondary endpoints were clinical and particularly neurological responses. Results. Twenty-seven patients have been included in 12 centres, median age was 61 (range 32-75), the median follow-up was 6.6 months (range 2-24). Eighteen patients were in group 1, with radiotherapy in 10 patients and ASCT in 8 patients; 9 patients were in group 2. Nineteen patients were in first line and 8 already treated. Only 2 patients experienced grade 3-4 adverse events due to LEN (cytopenia) and 2 patients had allergic rashes, no thrombotic event occurred. No engraftment syndrome was noted in the 5 patients already treated with ASCT. To date, no patient have died. Evolution of VEGF median values in serum and plasma, M-spike and dFLC levels and evolution of neurological measurements are reported in table 1. Neurological improvement was very rapid in some patients, using ONLS and 10MWT 11/18 evaluable patients had a neurological improvement after 2 cycles with an improvement of 1 or more of the ONLS score an /or change of 0.1 m/s or more in the 10MWT. Only one patient who progressed after nine cycles received another therapy. Conclusion. This is the first prospective trial of LEN-DEX in POEMS syndrome. This combination seems well tolerated in this disease with a good efficacy on VEGF measurements and rapid neurological improvement in the majority of patients. Updated data will be presented at the meeting. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

The a-wave of the electroretinogram was recorded from human subjects with normal vision, using a corneal electrode and ganzfeld stimulation. We applied the paired-flash technique, in which an intense 'probe' flash was delivered at different times after a 'test' flash. The amplitude of the probe-flash response provided a measure of the circulating current remaining at the appropriate time after the test flash. 2. We extended previous methods by measuring not at a fixed time, but at a range of times after the probe flash, and then calculating the ratio of the 'test-plus-probe' response to the 'probe-alone' response, as a function of time. 3. Under dark-adapted conditions the rod response derived by the paired-flash technique (in response to a relatively dim test flash) peaked at ca 120 ms, with a fractional sensitivity at the peak of ca 0.1 Td(-1) s(-1). 4. As reported previously, background illumination reduced the maximal response, reflecting a reduction in rod circulating current. In addition, it shortened the time to peak (to ca 70 ms at an intensity of 170 Td), and reduced the flash sensitivity measured at the peak. The flash sensitivity declined approximately according to Weber's Law, with a 10-fold reduction occurring at an intensity of 100-200 Td. We could not reliably measure responses at significantly higher background intensities because the circulating current became so small. 5. In order to investigate the phototransduction process after correction for response compression, we expressed the derived response as a fraction of the maximal response that could be elicited in the presence of the background. The earliest rising phase of this 'fractional response per unit intensity' was little affected by background illumination, suggesting that the amplification constant of transduction was unaltered by light adaptation.",Excluded

Study of the patterns of the postradiation death of differentiating and proliferating cells in the subependymal zone of the rat brain. [Russian] The post-irradiation cell kinetics was studied in vivo autoradiographically with 3H-thymidine, injected 60-80 minutes before the whole body X-irradiation of rats in doses of 50, 150 or 300 R. The wavy character of death was shown in the proliferating and differentiating rat's brain subependymal cells. After cell irradiation in G2- and S-phases four peaks of labeled mitotic cells with pycnotic nuclei (""mitotic death"") were recorded. The application of the double labelling technique with 3H- and 14C-thymidine showed that the lethally damaged cells irradiated in G1-phase had lost their ability to synthesize DNA. The nuclei of these cells became pycnotic later than 4 hours after irradiation, as follows indirectly from data recorded by Shmakova et al. (1972). The conformity in the time and alternation of the death peak appearance of differentiating cells and of the appearance of the death peaks and mitoses in proliferating cells enabled us to assume the persistence of the cycle (""short cycle"") in differentiating cells with the rhythm similar to that in the mitotic cycle. All the cells of the system were blocked during one hour, independently of the dose of irradiation, in one of six points of the cycle (mitotic cycle, short cycle). All these data suggest that the death of the differentiating cells and of cells which at the time of irradiation were in G1-phase could be timed to the final phase of the cycle (short cycle, mitotic cycle), coinciding in time with M-phase of the mitotic cycle.",Included
2069,"Biological effect of an alternating electric field on cell proliferation and synergistic antimitotic effect in combination with ionizing radiation Alternating electric fields at an intermediate frequency (100~300 kHz), referred to as tumour-treating fields (TTF), are believed to interrupt the process of mitosis via apoptosis and to act as an inhibitor of cell proliferation. Although the existence of an antimitotic effect of TTF is widely known, the proposed apoptotic mechanism of TTF on cell function and the efficacy of TTF are controversial issues among medical experts. To resolve these controversial issues, a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of TTF on cell function and the differences between the effects of TTF alone and in combination with other treatment techniques is essential. Here, we report experimental evidence of TTF-induced apoptosis and the synergistic antimitotic effect of TTF in combination with ionizing radiation (IR). For these experiments, two human Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (U373 and U87) were treated either with TTF alone or with TTF followed by ionizing radiation (IR). Cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and mitotic abnormalities were quantified after the application of TTF, and their percentages were markedly increased when TTF was combined with IR.

1902,"Macro to microdosimetric analysis for alpha particle radiopharmaceutical therapy for [<sup>211</sup>at]YC-I-27, a PSMA-targeting ligand for metastatic prostate cancer Purpose/Objective(s): Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a human transmembrane protein that is overexpressed 1000-fold in human prostate cancers (PC) and is internalized upon binding of ligands, making it an attractive target for radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). The expression of PSMA in normal tissues is limited to the prostate, brain and proximal kidney tubules. The purpose of this study was to perform a dosimetric analysis for the high-affinity PSMA-targeting ligand YC-I-27 labeled with the alpha particle emitter <sup>211</sup>At, to evaluate its possible use in alpha-RPT for metastatic PC. Materials/Methods: Mice bearing PSMA+ PC3 PIP and PSMA- PC3 flu xenografts were injected intravenously with 100 mCi of [<sup>211</sup>At]YC-I-27 and sacrificed 1 and 4 h post injection. The kidneys and tumors were harvested and measured for whole-organ/tumor dosimetry, after which, the tissues were frozen and cryosectioned for histology and alpha-Camera imaging. The alpha-Camera, a digital autoradiography imaging technology for detecting alpha particles in ex vivo tissue samples, was used to determine the distribution and activity concentration of [<sup>211</sup>At]YC-I-27 within the tissues. Whole-organ/tumor dosimetry was performed in combination with small scale sub organ/tumor dosimetry based on the alpha-Camera and histological images. Result(s): The highest uptake of [<sup>211</sup>At]YC-I-27 was 4 h post injection in the kidneys and PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumors with 98 and 40%ID/g, respectively. The whole-organ/tumor mean absorbed dose to the kidneys and PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumors were 37 and 14 mGy/kBq, respectively. The alpha-Camera images showed a heterogeneous distribution of the radioactivity with concentrations up to 5 times higher within the kidney cortex compared with the kidney average; PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumors exhibited selective uptake of [<sup>211</sup>At]YC-I-27 20-fold more compared with that of PSMA- PC3 flu tumors. The radioactivity distributions within the PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumors were overall homogenous with areas with 3-4.5 times higher concentrations than the tumor average, possibly due to uneven distribution of vasculature and necrosis within the tumors. Conclusion(s): alpha-RPT targeted to PSMA is considered as a promising treatment modality for metastatic PC, and the use of small-scale modeling combined with macro-to-micro conversion is essential to understanding alpha particle dosimetry and relating macroscopically measured activities to micro-scale absorbed doses. The PSMA-specific high tumor uptake combined with high linear energy transfer of the alpha particles confirms its therapeutic potential, and uptake in the kidneys suggests this is likely to be the dose limiting normal tissue.",Excluded
2088,"Temporal patterning of saccadic eye movement signals Electrical microstimulation is used widely in experimental neurophysiology to examine causal links between specific brain areas and their behavioral functions and is used clinically to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders in patients. Typically, microstimulation is applied to local brain regions as a train of equally spaced current pulses. We were interested in the sensitivity of a neural circuit to a train of variably spaced pulses, as is observed in physiological spike trains. We compared the effect of fixed, decelerating, accelerating, and randomly varying microstimulation patterns on the likelihood and metrics of eye movements evoked from the frontal eye field of monkeys, while holding the mean interpulse interval constant. Our results demonstrate that the pattern of microstimulation pulses strongly influences the probability of evoking a saccade, as well as the metrics of the saccades themselves. Specifically, the pattern most closely resembling physiological spike trains (accelerating pattern) was most effective at evoking a saccade, three times more so than the least effective decelerating pattern. A saccade-triggered average of effective random trains confirmed the positive relationship between accelerating rate and efficacy. These results have important implications for the use of electrical microstimulation in both experimental and clinical settings and suggest a means to study the role of temporal pattern in the encoding of behavioral and cognitive functions.",Excluded

Eight batches of microspheres containing chitosan or alginate loaded with beta-cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in two different cyclodextrin to polymer ratios were produced by spray drying. The results show that none of the tested CDs has direct cellular toxicity and they protect the cell viability from beta-peptide. The microspheres prepared are characterised by small particle sizes, ability to absorb water and to delay the in vitro dissolution rate of the CDs; good ex vivo mucoadhesive properties of the formulations are assessed.

Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the world-first tcMRgFUS system ever installed on a 1.5T MRI unit. Technical issues faced to achieve a safe and effective treatment will be discussed focusing on MR high-resolution live imaging and thermometry sequences optimization. Method(s): Patient enrollment was based on indication for functional neurosurgery and evidence of medication-refractory disease; a detailed medical history has been collected together with a complete clinical examination and a neurophysiological assessment. Eligible patients have been screened by MDCT and MRI. TcMRgFUS treatments have been performed by a neurosurgeon with proven experience in functional neurosurgery, and an experienced neuroradiologist, optimizing treatment parameters case by case. Result(s): Although this is a preliminary experience, the clinical success of our first treatments proves that this promising new technology for non-invasive treatment of various brain disorders can be safety and effectively performed also with the most popular MRI units operating at 1.5T. Conclusion(s): TcMRgFUS treatments are currently performed in a very few centers in the world and only using 3T MRI units. This is the world-first experience of functional neurosurgery successfully performed with a tcMRgFUS installed on the most popular and affordable 1.5T MR units Direct translational impacts are expected by the use of widely installed 1.5T MRI units both on patient quality of life and on savings in health spending, with reduction in the consumption of drugs, as well as in requests for medical examinations. Being able to use a radiation-free technique like the MRI as a guide and, even further, being able to verify the clinical effectiveness of such an innovative treatment before a permanent lesion is made in the targeted area of the brain is a huge step forward for both interventional radiology and functional neurosurgery.",Excluded

Thus, we explored changes in hippocampal volume according to the dose delivered and the location relative to the glioblastoma. Method(s): All patients were treated for glioblastoma with surgery, concomitant radiotherapy and temozolomide, and adjuvant temozolomide. Hippocampi were retrospectively delineated on three MRIs, performed at baseline, at the time of relapse, and on the last MRI available at the end of follow-up. A total of 98, 96, and 82 hippocampi were measured in the 49 patients included in the study, respectively. The patients were stratified into three subgroups according to the dose delivered to 40% of the hippocampus. In the group 1 (n = 6), the hippocampal D<inf>40%</inf> was < 7.4 Gy, in the group 2 (n = 13), only the H<inf>contra</inf> D<inf>40%</inf> was < 7.4 Gy, and in the group 3 (n = 30), the D<inf>40%</inf> for both hippocampi was > 7.4 Gy. Result(s): Regardless of the time of measurement, homolateral hippocampal volumes were significantly lower than those contralateral to the tumor. Regardless of the side, the volumes at the last MRI were significantly lower than those measured at baseline. There was a significant correlation among the decrease in hippocampal volume regardless of its side, and D<inf>max</inf> (p = 0.001), D<inf>98%</inf> (p = 0.028) and D<inf>40%</inf> (p = 0.0002).

Conclusion(s): There was a significant relationship between the radiotherapy dose and decrease in hippocampal volume. However, at the lowest doses, the hippocampi seem to exhibit an adaptive increase in their volume, which could indicate a plasticity effect.

1633,"Changes in intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in adult rat S1 during cortical reorganization Peripheral denervation causes significant changes in the organization of developing or adult primary somatosensory cortex (S1). However, the basic mechanisms that underlie reorganization are not well understood. Most attention has been focused on possible synaptic mechanisms associated with reorganization. However, another important determinant of cortical circuit function is the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons in the circuit. Here we document changes in the intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in cortical layer 2/3 in adult rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) after varying durations of forepaw denervation. Denervation of the forepaw induced a rapid and sustained shift in the location of the border between the forepaw and lower jaw representations of adult S1 (reorganization). Coronal slices from the reorganized region were maintained in vitro and the intrinsic properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of S1 were determined using whole cell recordings. In general, passive membrane properties were not affected by denervation; however, a variety of active properties were. The most robust changes were increases in the amplitudes of the fast and medium afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and an increase in the interval between action potentials (APs). Additional changes at some durations of denervation were observed for the AP threshold. These observations indicate that changes in intrinsic properties, mostly reflecting a decrease in overall excitation, may play a role in changes in cortical circuit properties during reorganization in adult S1, and suggest a possible role for AHPs in some of those changes.",Excluded

NPCs in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus are paradoxically associated with long-term neurocognitive sequelae of brain irradiation, as well as resistance to therapy and tumor recurrence. The reconciliation of these somewhat opposing functions is challenging. Current literature suggests that radiation and other treatments against the NPC in the hippocampus and the SVZ may influence patient outcome. As a result, both the SVZ and the hippocampus could have important implications on radiation treatment planning strategies, and future laboratory and clinical evaluations will be critical in designing studies to optimize treatment outcome, effectiveness, and safety.",Excluded

Osteoid osteoma (OO) of the cervical spine is frequently located close to the vertebral artery, spinal cord, or nerve roots and complete surgical excision is sometimes difficult by a limited approach and more extended surgery can require spinal fusion. Percutaneous radiofrequency coagulation (PRC) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of OO of the pelvis and limbs however, its role in the cervical spine is still nuclear. The Authors present a series of nine cases of OO of the cervical spine, six treated with surgical excision and three with PRC. No neurological or vascular complications occurred in both series. One case of the surgical series had only partial relief of persistent pain for 1 year due to incomplete excision, but is doing well 4 years after surgery. All the other surgical cases had complete relief of symptoms immediately after surgery and are symptom-free 3-10 years later. Two cases of PRC had complete relief of symptoms 24-48 h after surgery and are symptom-free 2 and 3 years later. One case of recurrent OO after surgery and treated with PRC with a reduced dose improved only, and still requires anti-inflammatory drugs 2 years after the procedure. Our still limited experience suggests that PRC can be safely performed in local anaesthesia with the patient awake, enabling to check for signs and symptoms of possible neurological injury. PRC can substitute extensive posterior approaches and reconstructions for OO of the posterior arch and joint pillar. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
2077,"Lu-177-Based Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy for Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a systemic cytotoxic radiation therapy using a compound of beta-emitting radionuclide chelated to a peptide for the treatment of tumor with overexpressed specific cell receptor such as somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) of neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Surgical resection should be performed for the curative treatment for NETs when it is feasible; however, a multi-disciplinary approach is needed when locally advanced or metastasized disease. PRRT with lutetium-177 (Lu-177)-labeled somatostatin analogues, as a new treatment modality targeting metastatic or inoperable NETs expressing the SSTR2, have been developed and successfully used for the past two decades. As Lu-177 emits both beta- and gamma-radiation, it has the ability as a theragnostic agent for NETs compared with only beta-emitting yttrium-90 labeled PRRT. Several recent studies reported that Lu-177 gave an overall positive response and improved the patients' quality of life. To fully exploit its potential, large comparative studies are needed for the assessment of distinct efficacies of Lu-177 labeled PRRT. Additionally, for extending the indications and developing new regimens of Lu-177-based PRRT, more dedicated clinical research is required.

1607,"Space motion sickness: incidence, etiology, and countermeasures Space motion sickness is experienced by 60% to 80% of space travelers during their first 2 to 3 days in microgravity and by a similar proportion during their first few days after return to Earth. Space motion sickness symptoms are similar to those in other forms of motion sickness; they include: pallor, increased body warmth, cold sweating, malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and anorexia. These are important because they may affect the operational performance of astronauts. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain space motion sickness: the fluid shift hypothesis and the sensory conflict hypothesis. The fluid shift hypothesis suggests that space motion sickness results from the cranial shifting of body fluids resulting from the loss of hydrostatic pressure gradients in the lower body when entering microgravity. The cranial fluid shifts lead to visible puffiness in the face, and are thought to increase the intracranial pressure, the cerebrospinal-fluid pressure or the inner ear fluid pressures, altering the response properties of the vestibular receptors and inducing space motion sickness. The sensory conflict hypothesis suggests that loss of tilt-related otolith signals upon entry into microgravity causes a conflict between actual and anticipated signals from sense organs subserving spatial orientation. Such sensory conflicts are thought to induce motion sickness in other environments. Space motion sickness is usually treated using pharmaceuticals, most of which have undesirable side effects. Further studies elucidating the underlying mechanism for space motion sickness may be required for developing new treatments. [References: 19]",Excluded

An animal model Experimental results are presented which describe induction and pathogenesis of the hydro-micrencephaly in NMRI-mice after single X-irradiation with 0.9 Gy or 1.9 Gy on gestation day (gd) 12. The ultrastructural alterations in the ventricular walls are sequentially investigated up to gross developmental damage. The ventricular zone is the most sensitive region in the developing brain. Its constituting undifferentiated and proliferating cells lose their palisade like orientation and fail subsequently to differentiate into primitive neurons, glia cells, or ependymal cells. Structurally this results in the thinning of ventricular walls by more than 50% associated with periventricular oedema and a dilation of the brain ventricles by 20-60%. Damage is clearly more pronounced with the higher dose. Repair processes originate from regions with intact Zonulae adherents which give also rise to typical globular or cylindrical heterotopic structures; these are known as rosettes and made up from undifferentiated proliferating ventricular cells. Perinatally in these rosettes cell replication persists, at a time when cell production in the ventricular zone has ceased. Histological changes are most prominent in and around the telencephalic roof consisting in replacement of the ependymal lining by a felt of glial fibers, faulty myelinisation, and periventricular oedema; postnatally these structural alterations lead to hydro-micrencephaly. Results from this animal model can be translated to the human situation because the fundamental developmental processes in the brain of mammals are similar despite species related differences of the time scale.",Excluded
1284,"Monitoring radiation treatment effects in glioblastoma: Are changes in flair volume prognostic? Purpose/Objective(s): Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity is believed to represent microscopic infiltration of tumor in glioblastoma (GBM), but is also affected by post-treatment changes. Numerous studies have evaluated the relationship between FLAIR volume and clinical outcomes, but results have been mixed. We sought to develop an objective measure of FLAIR volume that was independent of user input and not influenced by digital contrast adjustment. Using this automated method of image analysis, we evaluated the relationship between pre-radiation FLAIR volume and post-radiation changes in FLAIR volume in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed FLAIR imaging data from 56 consecutive GBM patients treated at a single institution between January 2012 and December 2013. An increase in FLAIR signal was defined as voxels 2 standard deviations above the median intensity value across the entire brain-extracted volume. This automated process was performed on the post-resection, pre-radiation MRI scan as well as all available post-radiation FLAIR sequences. The volume of voxels reaching this threshold was computed for all sequences. All patient charts were reviewed to compute the PFS, which was defined as any radiographic or clinical progression leading to a recommendation to change or stop treatment. Result(s): Of 56 patients, 24 (43%) were female and the median age was 60.5 years (range 16 e 85). Our analysis failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between the initial FLAIR volume and overall survival or clinically defined PFS. The change in FLAIR volume after radiation therapy as a function of time was also not related to these clinical outcome measures. The lack of a significant association between these measures was also true when using a more stringent threshold of FLAIR hyperintensity (5 standard deviations above the mean). Conclusion(s): With the assumption that FLAIR signal represents inflammatory edema caused by tumor infiltration into otherwise healthy tissue, many studies have attempted to correlate FLAIR volume with OS and PFS in the post-treatment setting. Results of these studies have varied, and the prognostic value of FLAIR volume has yet to be clearly demonstrated in glioblastoma. Using an automated and objective volumetric measure, we found no significant correlation between clinical outcomes and changes in FLAIR volume, a measure that is often used in routine MRI surveillance in the post-treatment setting. Our results suggest that gross edema volumes cannot directly predict PFS or OS.",Excluded

The UV wavelength was 280 nm. The radiation-induced potential shift of the voltage-dependent gating parameters was prevented or even reversed by the action of the sulfhydryl compounds (internal application), while the blocking effect was not affected. It is concluded that the two radiation effects are caused by two separate photoreactions. Internally applied N-ethylmaleimide, binding specifically to protein-SH groups, exhibits an effect similar to the ultraviolet-induced potential shift, without affecting the maximum sodium permeability. Therefore, the ultraviolet-induced potential shift might be caused by a photocatalyzed oxidation of -SH groups of membrane proteins changing the surface charge density at the inner side of the nodal membrane.",Excluded

Primary liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is still associated with a poor prognosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma are known to cause bone metastasis resulting in pain, neurologic impairment and risk of fracture. Palliative radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in symptomatic bone lesions and is usually performed as percutaneous fractionated radiotherapy. Methods and study design. From June 1987 to December 2009, 41 patients (median age, 64 years) with bonemetastasis received radiotherapy in our department. The analyzed patients were treated for 67 sites of bone lesions. We analyzed the applied fractionation schedules and the preferred sites of metastasis and symptoms, evaluated the therapeutic outcome in terms of symptomatic improvement, and described the prognosis of these patients. Results. Main indication for palliative radiotherapy was pain in 94% of all cases.Most frequent radiation protocols were 10 x 3 Gy (20 patients) and 20 x 2 Gy (19 patients). Median applied overall dose was 39 Gy (range, 4-48 Gy) and median single dose was 2.5 Gy (range, 1.8-4 Gy). The median duration of the radiotherapeutic treatment was 15 days (range, 2-24 days) and in 12 cases treatment was discontinuated. The overall response rate to palliative radiotherapy in bone metastasis was 77%. Median overall survival in both cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma patients was 4.2 months after initiation of radiotherapy (range, 0.2-38.9). Conclusions.

This study sought to develop a set of criteria identifying patients with neurogenic claudication (NC) caused by LSS and patient with radicular pain (RP) caused by LDH Results concerning NC caused by LSS are reported. Methods Phase 1: 17 spine specialists from 8 countries participated in a Delphi process, using an internet program, to rank symptoms and signs which suggest LSS as the cause of NC or DH as the cause of RP. Phase 2: 18 different spine specialists (surgeons and nonsurgeons) recruited patients during office visits and classify them with a high degree of confidence as having with either: 1) NC caused by LSS 2) RP caused by LDH or 3) non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) with non-specific leg pain radiation. Patients completed survey items and specialists documented examination signs. Signs and symptoms present in >=10 patients were analyzed by using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Patients with NC caused by LSS or NSLBP served as controls. Items with p <0.1 in univariate analysis were entered in the multivariate analysis.

Surgical treatment is a real challenge because this area is occupied by several critical neurovascular elements. Currently, surgery is the first choice of treatment, however several factors may be present that necessitate choosing the alternative treatments such as Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with CPA meningioma who were treated by GKS for a period of 8 years, were retrospectively reviewed. Factors affecting clinical and radiological improvement were analyzed.RESULTS: The median tumor volume was 6cm<sup>3</sup>. The mean values for maximal and marginal dose were 20.2 and 13.6Gy, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 31.5 months. Tumor control (lack of progression) was achieved in 96.8% of the patients and 55.9% of the patients showed tumor regression on follow-up MRI. The actuarial 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 96%. Clinical improvement was seen in 49.5% of the patients while 11.8% experienced worsening or new-onset symptoms. Adverse radiation effects were seen in 4.3% of the patients. A worse symptomatic outcome, male sex, a lower tumor coverage, and marginal doses <13.5Gy were associated with worse radiologic outcomes.

We have demonstrated that the initial migration of BrdU-labeled cells from the matrix cell zone towards the cortical plate during embryonic periods was decelerated when exposed to X-rays of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Gy on embryonic day 14, and that aberrantly placed neurons in the cerebral neocortex were noted in younger animals that were irradiated prenatally, whereas such derangement was less pronounced in mature animals. These observations suggest that some modification process might have occurred during the postnatal period.",Excluded
1729,"Protection of normal brain cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis by a mitochondria-targeted triphenyl-phosphonium-nitroxide: a possible utility in glioblastoma therapy Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor. A strong rationale to identify innovative approaches to treat these tumors is required since treatment failures result in local recurrences and median survivals range from 9 to 12 months. Glioma cells are reported to have less mitochondrial content compared to adjacent normal brain cells. Based on this difference, we suggest a new strategy, utilizing protection of normal brain cells by mitochondria-targeted electron scavengers and antioxidants-nitroxides-thus allowing for the escalation of the radiation doses. In this paper, we report that a conjugate of nitroxide with a hydrophobic cation, triphenyl-phosphonium (TPEY-Tempo), significantly protected brain endothelial cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis while radiosensitizing brain tumor cells. Thus, TPEY-Tempo may be a promising adjunct in the treatment of glioblastoma with the potential to not only prolong survival but also to maintain quality of life and reduce treatment toxicity.",Included

The protocol consisted of three treatment sessions every 3 to 4 weeks. Each session consisted of bilateral or unilateral catheterization of the hypogastric artery with the infusion of cisplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Day 1 and 2-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (FUDR) 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Day 2. An accelerated fractionation schedule of external-beam radiation was begun on Day 1 consisting of 200 rads twice daily for 4 days (1600 rads per session). Eight patients entered the protocol, and seven completed external-beam radiotherapy. Five completed three intraarterial sessions, and three, two sessions. Five of seven evaluable patients had a complete local response. Local control was sustained from 6 to 24 months in four patients. Complications included three sensorimotor neuropathies, one clinically insignificant catheter-related thrombosis, and three clinically significant radiation injuries.

1575,"Repeat radiosurgery for refractory trigeminal neuralgia OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery has become an important and minimally invasive alternative for patients with refractory trigeminal neuralgia. When a second procedure is necessary, the outcomes are unknown. The degree of pain relief and morbidity after repeat radiosurgery were studied.METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent a second gamma knife radiosurgery procedure because of unsatisfactory or unsustained relief of pain after the first procedure. Twenty-seven patients were assessable at median follow-up periods of 42.7 and 20.4 months after the first and second procedures, respectively. Most patients had undergone multiple previous operations of other types (microvascular decompression, radiofrequency rhizotomy, glycerol rhizotomy, balloon compression). The median target doses of the first and second radiosurgeries were 75 and 64 Gy, respectively. All patients were evaluated by a physician who did not participate in patient treatment.RESULTS: After the first radiosurgical procedure, 13 patients had an excellent response initially (complete relief without any medication), 3 had a good response (complete relief with some medication), 7 had a fair response (>50% relief), and 4 had a poor response (<50% pain relief or treatment failure). Repeat radiosurgery was performed in patients with recurrent or residual pain. After the second radiosurgical procedure, 5 patients had an excellent response, 8 had a good response, 10 had a fair response, and 4 had a poor response. Thirteen patients (48%) achieved complete pain relief (with or without medication). Two patients (7.4%) experienced new sensory symptoms after the first radiosurgical procedure, and three (12.7%, actuarial) experienced new sensory symptoms after the second procedure.CONCLUSION: Repeat radiosurgery provided a similar rate of pain relief as the first procedure, despite a modest dose reduction. The risk of new sensory symptoms was increased, but no other morbidity was identified. For patients who experience recurrent pain and choose to undergo a second procedure, our current procedure is to deliver a maximum dose of 50 to 60 Gy to a trigeminal target anterior to the root entry zone near the entrance of the nerve beneath the petrous dura.",Excluded
1874,"Proton-pump inhibitors can decrease gastrointestinal bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention BACKGROUND: Current medical therapies for patients who have an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) focus on the coagulation cascade and platelet inhibition. These, coupled with early use of cardiac catheterization and revascularization, have decreased morbidity and mortality rates in patients who have acute ischemic heart disease with risk of bleeding.OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The effect of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment was also analyzed.METHODS: This case-control study evaluated gastrointestinal bleeding within a year of PCI for stable angina and acute coronary syndromes at Nanjing First Hospital between 2008 and 2011. Cases were identified and outcomes assessed using linkage analysis of data from cardiology and gastroenterology department databases. Analysis of the case and control groups for both risk and protective factors was performed using independent two-sample Student's t-test with Fisher's exact P value and logistic regression.RESULTS: The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding following PCI was 1.3% (35/2680 patients). The risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding were advanced age, female gender, smoking, drinking, previous peptic ulcer and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. PPI use after PCI (P=0.000) was accompanied by a lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, with only a few cases of gastrointestinal bleeding events reported.CONCLUSION: The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel therapy was estimated to be 1.3%. Advanced age, being female, smokers, drinkers, previous peptic ulcer and previous gastrointestinal bleeding were significant independent risk factors. PPI for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding induced by the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel in patients after PCI was safe and effective.",Excluded
2022,"Localization and identification of concurrent sounds in the owl's auditory space map In nature, sounds from multiple sources sum at the eardrums, generating complex cues for sound localization and identification. In this clutter, the auditory system must determine ""what is where."" We examined this process in the auditory space map of the barn owl's (Tyto alba) inferior colliculus using two spatially separated sources simultaneously emitting uncorrelated noise bursts, which were uniquely identified by different frequencies of sinusoidal amplitude modulation. Spatial response profiles of isolated neurons were constructed by testing the source-pair centered at various locations in virtual auditory space. The neurons responded whenever a source was placed within the receptive field, generating two clearly segregated foci of activity at appropriate loci. The spike trains were locked strongly to the amplitude modulation of the source within the receptive field, whereas the other source had minimal influence. Two sources amplitude modulated at the same rate were resolved successfully, suggesting that source separation is based on differences of fine structure. The spike rate and synchrony were stronger for whichever source had the stronger average binaural level. A computational model showed that neuronal activity was primarily proportional to the degree of matching between the momentary binaural cues and the preferred values of the neuron. The model showed that individual neurons respond to and synchronize with sources in their receptive field if there are frequencies having an average binaural-level advantage over a second source. Frequencies with interaural phase differences that are shared by both sources may also evoke activity, which may be synchronized with the amplitude modulations from either source.",Excluded

1779,"A simpler method for total scalp irradiation: the multijaw-size concave arc technique The lateral electron-photon technique (LEPT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are commonly used for total scalp irradiation. However, the treatment planning and irradiation are laborious and time-consuming. We herein present the multijaw-size concave arc technique (MCAT) as a total scalp irradiation method that overcomes these problems. CT datasets for eight patients previously treated for angiosarcoma of the scalp were replanned using MCAT, LEPT, and IMRT. The MCAT was designed with a dynamic conformal arc for the total scalp, with a multileaf collimator to shield the brain. Two additional conformal arcs with a decreased upper-jaw position of the first dynamic conformal arc were used to reduce the cranial hotspots. The prescribed dose was 40 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV, defined as the total scalp plus a 4 mm margin). MCAT was compared with LEPT and IMRT with respect to the PTV dose homogeneity (D5%-95%), underdosage (V < 90%), overdosage (V > 110%), doses to the brain, and the delivery time and monitor units (MUs) for single irradiation. We were able to formulate treatment plans for all three techniques that could deliver the prescription dose in all patients. MCAT was significantly superior to LEPT with respect to PTV dose homogeneity, overdosage, and underdosage, although MCAT was inferior to IMRT with respect to dose homogeneity and overdosage. The mean brain dose and high-dosage volume of all three techniques were low, but IMRT provided larger volume to the brain than did the other two techniques in the low dosage region. In MCAT, the mean delivery time could be reduced by approximately half or more, and the mean MUs could be reduced by at least 100 compared to the other two techniques. MCAT can achieve total scalp irradiation with substantially fewer MUs and a shorter delivery time than LEPT and IMRT.",Excluded
1286,"Predictors of individual tumor local control after stereotactic radiosurgery for non-small cell lung cancer brain metastases Purpose: To evaluate local control rates and predictors of individual tumor local control for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Methods and Materials: Between June 1998 and May 2011, 401 brain metastases in 228 patients were treated with Gamma Knife single-fraction SRS. Local failure was defined as an increase in lesion size after SRS. Local control was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to identify an optimal cutpoint for conformality index relative to local control. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Median age was 60 years (range, 27-84 years). There were 66 cerebellar metastases (16%) and 335 supratentorial metastases (84%). The median prescription dose was 20 Gy (range, 14-24 Gy). Median overall survival from time of SRS was 12.1 months. The estimated local control at 12 months was 74%. On multivariate analysis, cerebellar location (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94, P=.009), larger tumor volume (HR 1.09, P<.001), and lower conformality (HR 0.700, P=.044) were significant independent predictors of local failure. Conformality index cutpoints of 1.4-1.9 were predictive of local control, whereas a cutpoint of 1.75 was the most predictive (P=.001). The adjusted Kaplan-Meier 1-year local control for conformality index >=1.75 was 84% versus 69% for conformality index <1.75, controlling for tumor volume and location. The 1-year adjusted local control for cerebellar lesions was 60%, compared with 77% for supratentorial lesions, controlling for tumor volume and conformality index. Conclusions: Cerebellar tumor location, lower conformality index, and larger tumor volume were significant independent predictors of local failure after SRS for brain metastases from NSCLC. These results warrant further investigation in a prospective setting. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1448,"Dose painting with Gamma Knife: Two techniques for delivering different doses to areas of recurrent or residual tumor after resection of brain metastases Purpose: We investigated the feasibility of using Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery for ""dose painting"" to deliver higher doses to residual or recurrent nodules and surgical cavity after resection of brain metastases. Methods and materials: Two integrated boost techniques were developed with GK. The single-target technique delineated both the surgical cavity (cavity) and gross disease (nodule) as a single target. Dose was prescribed to the target with the goal of covering the nodule with a higher dose. The 2-target technique delineated the cavity and nodule as separate target volumes, each prescribed to its own dose and planned separately. Two cases were used to illustrate each technique. The single-target technique was used to deliver 16 Gy to a smaller cavity (7 cm<sup>3</sup>) and a 20-Gy integrated boost to 2 nodules (case 1). The 2-target technique was used to deliver 12 Gy to a larger cavity (21.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) and 20 Gy to a single nodule (case 2). Result(s): For both cases, the cavity coverage with the prescribed dose was 100% with the standard plan and integrated boost techniques. For case 1, compared with a standard plan, the single-target technique improved the 20-Gy nodule coverage from 89.7% (nodule 1) and 97.9% (nodule 2) to 100% (both) and increased the minimum dose from 16.6 Gy to 20.8 Gy (nodule 1) and from 19.4 Gy to 20.8 Gy (nodule 2). For case 2, compared with a standard plan, the 2-target technique improved the 20-Gy nodule coverage from 4% to 100% and the minimum dose from 13.8 Gy to 21 Gy. Conclusion(s): Both GK integrated boost approaches allowed for effective delivery of higher doses to residual or recurrent nodules in a surgical cavity. In our experience, the single-target technique works well for small cavities, whereas the 2-target technique is well suited for larger cavities.

Methods Included in this study were 153 patients, who had ruptured and microsurgical-clipped aneurysms. All patients underwent dual-source computed tomography examination of electrocardiography-gated dynamic 4-dimensional computed tomography angiography before clipping. Original scanning data were reconstructed to produce 20 data sets of cardiac cycles with 5% time intervals. The aneurysm neck, transverse and longitudinal diameters, and volume from the 20 groups of images were measured to calculate their respective change rates. In addition, other data and clinical characteristics were recorded. Data were analyzed by logistic regression to identify factors associated with IAR. Results Of the 153 patients, 24 patients experienced IAR. Multivariable analysis revealed that the aneurysm neck change rate (P = 0.0001; odds ratio, 1.276) and aspect ratio (height/neck ratio, P = 0.025; odds ratio, 2.387) are predictors for IAR. When the change rate was greater than or equal to 60%, and the sensitivity and specificity were 91.7% and 76.7%, respectively. Conclusions Aneurysm neck change rate is independent predictor of IAR.

1283,"MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Neuroendocrine surveillance and management of neurosurgical patients Advances in the management of traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracranial tumours have led to improved survival rates and an increased focus on quality of life of survivors. Endocrine sequelae of the acute brain insult and subsequent neurosurgery, peri-operative fluid administration and/or cranial irradiation are now well described. Unrecognised acute hypopituitarism, particularly ACTH/cortisol deficiency and diabetes insipidus, can be life threatening. Although hypopituitarism may be transient, up to 30% of survivors of TBI have chronic hypopituitarism, which can diminish quality of life and hamper rehabilitation. Patients who survive SAH may also develop hypopituitarism, though it is less common than after TBI. The growth hormone axis is most frequently affected. There is also accumulating evidence that survivors of intracranial malignancy, who have required cranial irradiation, may develop hypopituitarism. The time course of the development of hormone deficits is varied, and predictors of pituitary dysfunction are unreliable. Furthermore, diagnosis of GH and ACTH deficiency require dynamic testing that can be resource intensive. Thus the surveillance and management of neuroendocrine dysfunction in neurosurgical patients poses significant logistic challenges to endocrine services. However, diagnosis and management of pituitary dysfunction can be rewarding. Appropriate hormone replacement can improve quality of life, prevent complications such as muscle atrophy, infection and osteoporosis and improve engagement with physiotherapy and rehabilitation.",Excluded

This study aimed to estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in this patient population over more than 10 years of follow-up.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohorts consisted of all patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of NPC (n=1094), whereas patients hospitalized for an appendectomy during 1997 and 1998 (n=4376) acted as the control group and surrogate for the general population. Cox proportional hazard model was performed as a means of comparing the stroke-free survival rate between the two cohorts after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors.RESULTS: Of the 292 patients with ischemic strokes, 62 (5.7%) were from the NPC cohort and 230 (5.3%) were from the control group. NPC patients ages 35-54 had a 1.66 times (95% CI, 1.16-2.86; p=0.009) higher risk of ischemic stroke after adjusting for patient characteristics, comorbidities, geographic region, urbanization level of residence, and socioeconomic status. There was no statistical difference in ischemic stroke risk between the NPC patients and appendectomy patients ages 55-64 years (hazard ratio=0.87; 95% CI, 0.56-1.33; p=0.524) after adjusting for other factors.CONCLUSIONS: Young NPC patients carry a higher risk for ischemic stroke than the general population. Besides regular examinations of carotid duplex, different irradiation strategies or using new technique of radiotherapy, such as intensity modulated radiation therapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy, should be considered in young NPC patients.",Excluded

2255,"Autonomous Optimization of Targeted Stimulation of Neuronal Networks Driven by clinical needs and progress in neurotechnology, targeted interaction with neuronal networks is of increasing importance. Yet, the dynamics of interaction between intrinsic ongoing activity in neuronal networks and their response to stimulation is unknown. Nonetheless, electrical stimulation of the brain is increasingly explored as a therapeutic strategy and as a means to artificially inject information into neural circuits. Strategies using regular or event-triggered fixed stimuli discount the influence of ongoing neuronal activity on the stimulation outcome and are therefore not optimal to induce specific responses reliably. Yet, without suitable mechanistic models, it is hardly possible to optimize such interactions, in particular when desired response features are network-dependent and are initially unknown. In this proof-of-principle study, we present an experimental paradigm using reinforcement-learning (RL) to optimize stimulus settings autonomously and evaluate the learned control strategy using phenomenological models. We asked how to (1) capture the interaction of ongoing network activity, electrical stimulation and evoked responses in a quantifiable 'state' to formulate a well-posed control problem, (2) find the optimal state for stimulation, and (3) evaluate the quality of the solution found. Electrical stimulation of generic neuronal networks grown from rat cortical tissue in vitro evoked bursts of action potentials (responses). We show that the dynamic interplay of their magnitudes and the probability to be intercepted by spontaneous events defines a trade-off scenario with a network-specific unique optimal latency maximizing stimulus efficacy. An RL controller was set to find this optimum autonomously. Across networks, stimulation efficacy increased in 90% of the sessions after learning and learned latencies strongly agreed with those predicted from open-loop experiments. Our results show that autonomous techniques can exploit quantitative relationships underlying activity-response interaction in biological neuronal networks to choose optimal actions. Simple phenomenological models can be useful to validate the quality of the resulting controllers.",Excluded

2182,"Prospective Peer Review for Patients Undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Intracranial Radiosurgery in a Multi-Site Community-Setting is Both Feasible and Effective Purpose/Objective(s): Delivery of stereotactic radiation requires a level of quality assurance beyond traditional fractionation given the impact of misdelivery. While efforts to improve peer review at academic centers have been reported, very few guidelines exist in the literature for implementation of a program with more intensive review of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or intracranial radiosurgery (SRS) in a community-based setting. Here, we report on the logistics as well as the first 260 cases reviewed in one year of a pilot program at a community-based multi-location network of radiation oncology facilities. Materials/Methods: We implemented a departmental process at four network radiation facilities affiliated with an academic institution that no SBRT or SRS case could be treated without a second physician approving the contours and plan prior to delivery of the first fraction. Coincident with this process, we began an SBRT/SRS peer review rounds for 30-60 minutes per week. Ideally, cases were reviewed initially for contour approval including targets, organs at risk (OAR), image registration, and overall directive/modality selection. Cases approved in this phase progressed to planning and were reviewed the following week for final peer approval. Cases with more urgent turnaround times, particularly intracranial radiosurgery, were often required to be reviewed outside of rounds by a second physician. Recommendations for changes in both the contouring/directive review phase and the planning phase were collected prospectively. Changes were designated major changes retrospectively by the physician team if the change materially altered the final plan. Result(s): From March 2019 to February 2020, 260 cases were treated with SBRT or SRS in our network. 56 cases (21.5%) had a change recommendation. 19 (7%) cases had a major revision. 95% (53 cases) of changes detected by this program were during the contouring/intent phase of planning with only 5% (3 cases) requiring revision at the planning phase or at treatment delivery. Most common deviations detected tracked closely with cases reported in the ASTRO RO-ILS system such as OAR (35%) and target revisions (18%), minor prescription adjustments (25%) and prior radiation dose not accounted for (9%). Near universal prospective peer review of stereotactic cases (99.5%) was accomplished using this system. Conclusion(s): Here, we demonstrate that prospective peer review is both feasible and results in a significant number of changes - 21.5% of cases reviewed. Major changes that materially altered the plan occurred in 19 of 260 cases (7%). This system allowed for near universal prospective peer review of these cases with no significant delay in planning or treatment with a low burden on physicians and staff of approximately 1 hour per week per physician. Prospective peer review also resulted in very few re-planned cases in the post-planning phase including plan check and changes discovered at the time of treatment delivery (1% overall).

2340,"Combination of surgery and stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) with 3D-SPECT/CT treatment planning for primary and metastatic liver tumors Purpose/Objective(s): Evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of SRT in combination with hepatic resection of primary and metastatic liver tumors. Materials/Methods: Sixteen patients completed hepatectomy and SRT for either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (6) or metastases from colorectal (5), neuroendocrine (2), uterine (2), or sarcoma (1) primary. Twenty-one operable metastases were resected in 5 patients and gold fiducials were placed into the unresectable lesions to facilitate definitive SRT. Three patients with initially unresectable tumors received preoperative SRT followed by R0 resection. SRT as a bridge to liver transplant was used in 4 patients with HCC. Four patients had salvage SRT for recurrence after surgery. All patients completed 4D-CT and 3DSPECT/ CT to define functional normal liver volume (NLV) for SRT planning. MV-fluoro was performed to confirm tumor/fiducial respiratory motion within the PTV. In retrospect, our patient's treatment planning, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were reviewed under an IRB approved outcomes study. Toxicity was graded according to CTCAE v3.0. Result(s): All patients successfully completed a combination of hepatectomy and SRT. Forty lesions were treated with hepatectomy and 20 (<= 3 per patient) received SRT with a mean PTV of 132.6 cc (range, - 9.7- 803.5). The mean dose was 47.7 Gy (range, - 36-60) prescribed to the PTV in 5-16 fractions. With median follow-up of 17.7 months (range, - 5.8-32.1), 2 patients had grade 3 elevation of Total Bilirubin prior to initiation of SRT which persisted through treatment. No incidence of > grade 1 radiation-induced liver disease was observed. The most common clinical toxicity was Grade <= 2 fatigue. No patients had grade > 2 clinical toxicity. As a group, functional NLVs defined on 3D-SPECT/CT were significantly reduced compared to liver volumes defined on CT and estimated from the Body Surface Area equation (p = 0.037 and p = 0.0012 respectively). Postoperative morbidity was <= Grade 1. On followup imaging, no in-field failures have occurred. A total of 18.7% of the patients have had a failure elsewhere in the liver. Overall survival was 75% with 4 deaths, 2 of which were from liver failure and 2 from progressive systemic disease. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary study indicates that combination of liver SRT with hepatic resection is safe and effective. It can be used preoperatively to increase resectability or postoperatively to salvage surgical failures. It can also be used to target unresectable metastases in combination with limited hepatectomies for resectable peripheral lesions thereby expanding indications for curative treatment.

Tests of sensitivity of these double mutants to UV and to chemical mutagens revealed that mus-26 and upr-1 belong to the same epistatic group. The UV dose-response curve of mus-26 showed a characteristic plateau in the range of 100-200 J/m2. The same characteristic was also shown in the dose-response curves of upr-1 and the double mutant, upr-1 mus-26. Photoreactivation of UV damage in mus-26, upr-1 and upr-1 mus-26 was defective but not null. Assays were made of the reversion rate of ad-8 in strains that also carried UV-sensitive mutations. The reversion frequencies of the strains with upr-1 and upr-1 mus-26 were very low for the UV dose range below 300 J/m2, similarly to mus-26. Previously reported homozygous sterility of mus-26 was not caused by the mus-26 locus itself, and fertile strains were obtained among progeny. The results of this study suggest that mus-26 and upr-1 have similar properties in DNA repair.",Excluded
2331,"Current management of brain metastases, with a focus on systemic options Brain metastases are an important sequelae of many types of cancer, most commonly lung cancer. Current treatment options include whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, and chemotherapy. Corticosteroids and antiepileptic medications are commonly used for palliation of mass effect and seizures, respectively. The overall median survival is only 4 months after WBRT. Combined-modality strategies of WBRT with either chemotherapy or novel anticancer agents are under clinical investigation. Promising results have been obtained with several experimental agents and confirmatory phase III trials are underway. Although improvement in overall survival has not been seen universally, reduction in death due to progression of brain metastases and prolongation of the time to neurologic and neurocognitive progression have been reported in selected series. On the basis of these findings, it might be possible to identify new agents that may enhance the efficacy of WBRT.",Excluded
1584,"An unusual case of radioactive seed migration to the vertebral venous plexus and renal artery with nerve root compromise PURPOSE: We report a case of prostate brachytherapy seed migration to the vertebral venous plexus and subsequently to the renal artery with corresponding dosimetry analysis describing nerve doses.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 52-year-old male with low-risk prostate carcinoma (clinical stage T1c; Gleason score=6; prostate-specific antigen level of 5.5) underwent transperineal permanent prostate seed implant. Postimplantation routine imaging had failed to locate the missing seed, but he subsequently presented with back pain and parathesia with radiation down the leg.RESULTS: CT with bony windows and MRI had located the seed in the left L5 vertebral venous plexus. Neurosurgical intervention failed to locate and remove the migrated seed. Postsurgery, the left lower limb parathesia persisted but had normal nerve conduction studies. Dose to the spinal nerve roots and nearby structures were estimated using a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation. Serial X-ray imaging and CT had found that the seed had further migrated to left renal hilum.CONCLUSIONS: Seed migration to vertebral venous plexus is uncommon and to our knowledge this is the third reported case. Its subsequent migration to the renal hilum is most unusual. CT with bony windows or MRI are required if this is suspected. There is risk of spinal or nerve root damage and dose to these structures has to be estimated using GEANT4, although the tissue tolerance in the setting of low-dose rates are unknown and long-term followup of this patient is required.",Excluded

2006,"Rational design of nanosystems for simultaneous drug delivery and photodynamic therapy by quantum mechanical modeling Drug delivery systems are based on reversible interactions between carriers and drugs. Spacers are often introduced to tailor the type of interaction and to keep drugs intact. Here, we model a drug delivery system based on a functionalized curved TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle of realistic size (700 atoms - 2.2 nm) by the neurotransmitter dopamine to carry the anticancer chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX). The multiscale quantum chemical study aims at unraveling the nature and mechanism of the interactions between the components and the electronic properties of the composite system. We simulate the temperature effect through molecular dynamics runs of thermal annealing. Dopamine binds preferentially to low coordinated Ti sites on the nanoparticle through dissociated bidentate and chelate modes involving the diol groups. DOX is tethered by H-bonds, pi-pi stacking, dipole-dipole interactions and dispersion forces. Comparing different coverage densities of the spacer on the nanoparticle surface, we assess the best conditions for an effective drug transport and release: only at full coverage, DOX does not slip among the dopamine molecules to reach the nanoparticle surface, which is crucial to avoid the formation of stable coordinative bonds with under-coordinated Ti atoms. Finally, given the strong absorption properties and fluorescence of DOX and of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst, we model the effect of light irradiation through excited state calculations to localize excitons and to follow the charge carrier's life path. This fundamental study on the nature and mechanism of drug/carrier interaction provides a solid ground for the rational design of new experimental protocols for a more efficient drug transport and release and its combination with photodynamic therapy.",Excluded
1825,"Clinical and pathological characteristics of brain metastasis resected after failed radiosurgery OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the tumor histopathology and clinical characteristics of patients who underwent resection of their brain metastasis after failed gamma knife radiosurgery.METHODS: This study was a retrospective review from a prospective database. A total of 1200 brain metastases in 912 patients were treated by gamma knife radiosurgery during a 7-year period. Fifteen patients (1.6% of patients, 1.2% of all brain metastases) underwent resective surgery for either presumed tumor progression (6 patients) or worsening neurological symptoms associated with increased mass effect (9 patients). Radiographic imaging, radiosurgical and surgical treatment parameters, histopathological findings, and long-term outcomes were reviewed for all patients.RESULTS: The mean age at the time of radiosurgery was 57 years (age range, 32-65 years). Initial pathological diagnoses included metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma in 8 patients (53%), melanoma in 4 patients (27%), renal cell carcinoma in 2 patients (13%), and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in 1 patient (7%). The mean time interval between radiosurgery and surgical extirpation was 8.5 months (range, 3 weeks to 34 months). The mean treatment volume for the resected lesion at the time of radiosurgery was 4.4 cm(3) (range, 0.6-8.4 cm(3)). The mean dose to the tumor margin was 21Gy (range, 18-24 Gy). In addition to the 15 tumors that were eventually resected, a total of 32 other metastases were treated synchronously, with a 78% control rate. The mean volume immediately before surgery for the 15 resected lesions was 7.5 cm(3) (range, 3.8-10.2 cm(3)). Histological findings after radiosurgery varied from case to case and included viable tumor, necrotic tumor, vascular hyalinization, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, reactive gliosis in surrounding brain tissue, and an elevated MIB-1 proliferation index in cases with viable tumor. The mean survival for patients in whom viable tumor was identified (9.4 months) was significantly lower than that of patients in whom only necrosis was seen (15.1 months; Fisher's exact test, P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Radiation necrosis and tumor radioresistance are the most common causes precipitating a need for surgical resection after radiosurgery in patients with brain metastasis.",Excluded
1653,"Enhancement of ERK phosphorylation and photic responses in Vc/C1 neurons of a migraine model Although it is well known that migraine pain is enhanced by photic stimulation of the eye, the mechanisms underlying this response are not yet understood. Noxious stimulation to the dura is known to activate trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis and upper cervical spinal cord (Vc/C1) neurons, causing migraine pain. Intense photic stimulation to the eye is also known to activate certain Vc/C1 neurons, thus increasing migraine pain. In this study, we hypothesized that Vc/C1 neurons receiving noxious dural input would be further activated by intense photic stimulation, resulting in the enhancement of migraine pain. However, mechanisms underlying the interactions between dural and photic sensory information in Vc/C1 neurons is unknown. To evaluate the above hypothesis, we studied phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) -immunoreactive (IR) cells in Vc/C1 in dural mustard oil (DMO)-administrated rats. The change in neuronal excitability of Vc/C1 nociceptive neurons receiving input from the dura in DMO rats was examined and tested if those neurons were modulated by intense flush light stimulation. There were many pERK-IR cells in the lateral portion of Vc/C1 after MO administration to the dura. Flashlight presentation to the eye in DMO rats caused an enhancement of ERK phosphorylation in Vc/C1 neurons and pERK-IR cells were significantly suppressed after intracisternal administration of MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. Dura-light sensitive (DL) neurons were recorded in the lateral portion of Vc/C1 and photic responses of DL neurons were significantly enhanced following dural MO administration. These findings indicate that DL Vc/C1 neurons in DMO rats intensified their responses to intense photic stimulation and that ERK phosphorylation in Vc/C1 neurons receiving noxious dural input increased with intense photic stimulation, suggesting that Vc/C1 nociceptive neurons are involved in the enhancement of dural nociception associated with intense light stimulation.",Excluded
1699,"Quantitative analysis of calcium-dependent vesicle recruitment and its functional role at the calyx of Held synapse Recruitment of release-ready vesicles at synapses is one of the important factors, which determine dynamic properties of signaling between neurons in the brain. It has been shown that the rate of vesicle recruitment is accelerated by strong synaptic activity. An elevated concentration of calcium ions in the presynaptic terminal ([Ca2+]i) has been proposed to be responsible for this effect. However, the precise relationship between [Ca2+]i and recruitment has not been established yet, and the functional consequences of accelerated recruitment during synaptic activity have not been quantified experimentally. To probe the intracellular Ca2+ dependence of vesicle recruitment and to examine its functional role during trains of action potential (AP)-like stimuli, we monitored [Ca2+]i and synaptic responses simultaneously with paired recordings at the calyx of Held synapse. We found that a distinct, rapidly releasing vesicle pool is replenished with a rate that increases linearly with [Ca2+]i, without any apparent cooperativity. The slope factor for this increase is approximately 1 pool/(microM x s). Blocking Ca2+-dependent recruitment specifically with a calmodulin binding peptide revealed that the steady-state EPSCs during 100 Hz AP-like trains were maintained through this Ca2+-dependent recruitment mechanism. Using a simple model of vesicle dynamics, we estimated that the recruitment rate accelerated 10-fold during the steady-state compared with the rate at resting [Ca2+]i. We could also demonstrate an approximate sixfold increase in release probability (facilitation) during the initial 5-15 AP-like stimuli of such trains in our experimental condition, regardless of EPSC depression.",Excluded
1979,"Spatial buffering of light-evoked potassium increases by retinal Muller (glial) cells Activity-dependent variations in extracellular potassium concentration in the central nervous system may be regulated, in part, by potassium spatial buffering currents in glial cells. The role of spatial buffering in the retina was assessed by measuring light-evoked potassium changes in amphibian eyecups. The amplitude of potassium increases in the vitreous humor was reduced to approximately 10 percent by 50 micromolar barium, while potassium increases in the inner plexiform layer were largely unchanged. The decrease in the vitreal potassium response was accurately simulated with a numerical model of potassium current flow through Muller cells, the principal glial cells of the retina. Barium also substantially increased the input resistance of Muller cells and blocked the Muller cell-generated M-wave, indicating that barium blocks the potassium channels of Muller cells. Thus, after a light-evoked potassium increase within the retina, there is a substantial transfer of potassium from the retina to the vitreous humor by potassium current flow through Muller cells.",Excluded

Gastrointestinal side-effects dominate during both chemo- and radiotherapy, with the risk of severe haematological, infectious and thromboembolic complications during chemotherapy. Long-term sequelae comprise second cancers, cardiovascular morbidity/mortality and gonadal dysfunction. Nevertheless, 70% of patients who attempt paternity after treatment are successful. About 20% of patients develop long-term neuro- and/or ototoxicity. The long-term quality of life of survivors of testicular cancer is comparable to that of controls. Risk-adapted treatment of patients with testicular cancer and adequate follow-up of those at risk of life-threatening toxicity are ways to reduce the short- and long-term morbidity in survivors. Patients should be informed about these potential complications and the importance of adjusting their lifestyle (e.g. smoking habits, physical activity and weight control).

In this study, the seven-person crew (four men, three women) lived a Martian sol (24.65 h) for 37 d during a long-term stay at the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) on Devon Island, Canada. Crewmembers underwent cardiopulmonary monitoring for signs of circadian disruption and completed a modified Pittsburgh Sleep Diary to monitor subjective fatigue. Crewmembers underwent cognitive testing to identify the effects, if any, of sleep disruption upon cognitive skill.METHODS: A Martian sol was implemented for 37 d during the Arctic mission. Each crewmember completed an adapted version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary in tandem with electrocardiograph (ECG) cardiopulmonary monitoring of sleep by the Cardiac Adapted Sleep Parameters Electrocardiogram Recorder (CASPER). Crewmembers also underwent cognitive testing during this time period.RESULTS: Sleep diary data indicate improvement in alertness with the onset of the sol (fatigue decreasing from 5.1 to 4.0, alertness increasing from 6.1 to 7.0). Cardiopulmonary data suggest sleep instability, though trends were not statistically significant. Crewmember decision speed time scores improved from pre-Mars to Mars (average improving from 66.5 to 84.0%), though the remainder of cognitive testing results were not significant.DISCUSSION: While subjective data demonstrate improved sleep and alertness during the sol, objective data demonstrate no significant alteration of sleep patterns.

1551,"Effects on the nervous system by exposure to electromagnetic fields: experimental and clinical studies Exposure to electromagnetic fields may cause various types of effects on nervous tissue, in severe cases even irreversible damage. The exposure conditions, i.e. frequency including type and extent of modulation, time, intensity, wave form, as well as shape, size and position of exposed subject and possible treatment with drugs, are factors determining if damage, acute or chronic, ultimately result. Long term exposure of newborn rabbits, rats and mice to electromagnetic fields of power frequency (10-14 kV/m; 50 or 60 Hz; sinusoidal wave form; 21-24 h per day) may cause affection and even damage to the nervous system. Large nerve cells showed reactive changes such as lamellar bodies and cytoskeletal alteration to an extent varying with exposure conditions. Reactive neuroglial changes as well as increase in neuroglial marker proteins could concomitantly be demonstrated. The changes seemed to be reversible although we only have incomplete data available. Exposure in vitro of frog sciatic nerve to 16-60 Hz sinusoidal low current (50-1000 nA) for 17 h induced cytoskeletal changes. Exposure of rabbits to pulsed microwaves of moderate to high intensity (3.1 GHz; 300 Hz modulation; peak duration 1.4 usec with maximal peak intensity about 1000 times average; 55 mW/cm; SAR in the brain cortex about 20 W/kg; increase of temperature as measured by lightguide-equipped instruments in right brain hemisphere about 1-2 degrees C) during 1 h per day during three days resulted in no obvious initial changes in behaviour. Minimal acute dam- age could be demonstrated. However, after two to four months and later on both structural, immunohistochemical and biochemical changes could be documented. Radar technicians accidently and/or occupationally exposed to microwaves showed psychoneurological signs of affection as well as changes in cerebrospinal fluid protein pattern. No related changes have been noticed among matched controls. Exposure of nervous tissue to electromagnetic fields ranging from power frequency to microwaves may thus exert a wide range of effects, mostly by mechanisms we know little about.",Excluded

Given the numerous telecommunication systems and our lack of knowledge as to the impact of electromagnetic effects, this study investigated the reality of possible AIMD disturbance by EMFs by interviewing health professionals. Method A self-administered postal questionnaire was sent to almost 5,000 physicians in five specialties: cardiology; endocrinology; ears, nose, and throat; urology; and neurology. It collected data on the existence and annual number of incidents observed and the conditions under which they occurred, the EMF sources involved, and the means of managing the malfunctions. Results A total of 1,188 physicians agreed to participate. Sixteen percent of participants reported cases of implant failure, three-quarters of whom, mainly in cardiology, reported rates of at least one incident per year - amounting to more than 100 incidents per year in all. Severity appeared to be moderate (discomfort or transient symptoms), but frequently required resetting or, more rarely, replacing the device. Some serious incidents were, however, reported. The sources implicated were basically of two types: electronic security systems (antitheft and airport gates) and medical electromagnetic radiation devices. These incidents were poorly reported within the public health system, preventing follow-up and effective performance of alert and surveillance functions. Conclusion Although minor, the risk of interference between EMF sources and AIMDs is real and calls for vigilance. It particularly concerns antitheft and airport security gates, though other sources may also cause incidents. ©2013, The Authors. Journal compilation ©2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

I report here measurements of outer segment current in individual rod photoreceptors which demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations occur at a greatly increased rate following bleaches of around 1%, and that these fluctuations have the form expected for random occurrences of the single photon events.

2323,"Proposed mechanism for reduced jugular vein flow in microgravity Internal jugular flow is reduced in space compared with supine values, which can be associated with internal jugular vein (IJV) thrombosis. The mechanism is unknown but important to understand to prevent potentially serious vein thromboses on long duration flights. We used a novel, microgravity-focused numerical model of the cranial vascular circulation to develop hypotheses for the reduced flow. This model includes the effects of removing hydrostatic gradients and tissue compressive forces - unique effects of weightlessness. The IJV in the model incorporates sensitivity to transmural pressure across the vein, which can dramatically affect resistance and flow in the vein. The model predicts reduced IJV flow in space. Although tissue weight in the neck is reduced in weightlessness, increasing transmural pressure, this is more than offset by the reduction in venous pressure produced by the loss of hydrostatic gradients and tissue pressures throughout the body. This results in a negative transmural pressure and increased IJV resistance. Unlike the IJV, the walls of the vertebral plexus are rigid; transmural pressure does not affect its resistance and so its flow increases in microgravity. This overall result is supported by spaceflight measurements, showing reduced IJV area inflight compared with supine values preflight. Significantly, this hypothesis suggests that interventions that further decrease internal IJV pressure (such as lower body negative pressure), which are not assisted by other drainage mechanisms (e.g. gravity), might lead to stagnant flow or IJV collapse with reduced flow, which could increase rather than decrease the risk of venous thrombosis.

Intralesionally applied radioimmunotherapy is a possible therapeutical option with the potential to improve survival of patients with malignant glioma. We investigated side effects and survival after surgery, conventional radiotherapy and additional radioimmunotherapy with labelled tenascin-antibodies in patients with malignant glioma.METHODS: Since 1995, 37 patients were treated with radioimmunotherapy after resection and radiotherapy of a malignant glioma. Patients received antibodies labelled with yttrium-90 and iodine-131 in different doses into the tumour cavity via a previously implanted ommaya-reservoir. Treatment was applied in up to 8 cycles (mean 2.96 cycles) in time intervals of 6-8 weeks. Mean age was 46 years, histology was anaplastic astrocytoma in 13 patients and glioblastoma in 24 patients.RESULTS: For the whole group median survival time has not yet been reached. For glioblastoma the median survival time is 17 months, 5-year survival probability for anaplastic astrocytoma is 85% approximately. Quality of life was acceptable. Acute side effects following treatment were headache, seizures and worsening of pre-existing neurological symptoms.

1582,"Classifying the risk of ionizing radiation exposure after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Learning Objectives: We hypothesized that patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) could be classified by their risk of receiving potentially harmful ionizing radiation exposure (PHIRE) from diagnostic tests and medical procedures. Method(s): The EMR of all patients admitted to our institution with aSAH from 01/2012-12/2015 were retrospectively evaluated using an IRB-approved protocol for patient-specific and disease-specific data. Patients were excluded if they died prior to discharge. Total effective dose of ionizing radiation (TEDIR) was calculated from published data. PHIRE was considered to have occurred in patients with TEDIR> 50 mSV, the annual radiation exposure limit for radiation workers. A multivariate classification tree was created to predict PHIRE risk groups. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk of PHIRE between the risk groups. Result(s): Data were collected from 108 aSAH patients. The mean TEDIR was 47.8 mSv. After development of the multivariate classification tree, the tree was pruned to include only ventriculostomy (EVD), Hunt/Hess score (HH), and aneurysm location, according to normal statistical conventions. Patients who did not have an ventriculostomy (EVD) were at low risk for PHIRE (N = 2/35, (5.7%)). Patients with an EVD + HH 2 + anterior circulation aneurysms were at moderate risk for PHIRE (N = 17/42, 40.5%). (OR = 11.2, p = 0.002). Patients with an EVD + HH < 2 or EVD + HH 2 + posterior circulation aneurysms were at high risk for PHIRE (N = 23/31, 74.2%) (OR = 47.4, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In this study, aSAH patients were categorized into low, moderate and high risk groups of PHIRE according to three factors: EVD, HH, and aneurysm location. These groups likely represent differential baseline neurologic status and risk of neurologic complications. Alternative diagnostic or therapeutic modalities should be utilized, when possible, for patients in the high-risk group and should be considered for patients in the moderate-risk group.

1614,"Automated image enhancement (clarityiq) to reduce radiation dosage without loss of image quality Background: Excess radiation exposure is related with adverse events. Therefore the allowed radiation dosage for healthcare workers is regulated by governing agencies. Although the dosage patients receive is relatively limited, the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle still applies. ClarityIQ is an automated algorithm developed to reduce the radiation dosage used without loss of image quality. Method(s): Diagnostic coronary angiography images of the left coronary artery (LCA) were acquired in LAO 45 with 20 cranial angulation with hand injected contrast dye. Quality of ClarityIQ (50% radiation reduction) was compared with standard image acquisition (100% radiation exposure). Images were reviewed by three independent reviewers and scored on subjective image quality, good, fair, poor. Result(s): Our preliminary data demonstrate that 47 patients (mean age 62.8 +/- 11.1) were enrolled with a mean BMI of 26.6 kg/m2 +/- 3.7. All had normal kidney function (MDRD > 60) and no known previous myocardial infarction of the LCA. The image quality of the ClarityIQ images was of adequate diagnostic quality in all patients as assessed by the operator. Independent reviewers assessed the images as good in 29, fair in 18 and poor in none. Reduction in mean DAP was 58%, mean DAP of ClarityIQ was 1126 mGy.cm2 and 1955 mGy.cm2 for the standard image acquisition. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that with a novel acquisition technique that enhances the coronary tree based on a computer algorithm, adequate images can be acquired with a reduction of 58% of radiation dose.

Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the 210 LD-SCLC patients, who were treated with CRT at Seoul National University Hospital from Apr 1999 to Nov 2012. The relationship between downstaging and OS was analyzed, and subgroup analysis on the responders was performed. Result(s): Patients showing CR, partial remission (PR), and stable disease (SD)/progressive disease (PD) were 37.1% (n=78), 46.2% (n=97), and 16.7% (n=35), respectively. The median OS for CR, PR, and SD/PD were 47.9 months (mo), 21.8 mo, and 11.2 mo, respectively (P <0.001). Patients showing downstaging and no change/upstaging were 61.5% (n=129) and 38.5% (n=81), respectively. The median OS for downstaging and no change/upstaging were 36.5 mo and 14.4 mo, respectively (P <0.001). Among the 97 patients achieving PR, OS were statistically differed by downstaging (26.0 mo in patients with downstaging and 17.7 mo in patients without downstaging [P =0.021]). In the multivariate analyses, female, downstaging, lower initial TNM stage, and prophylactic cranial irradiation were independent good prognostic factors for OS. Conclusion(s): Downstaging was independent prognostic factor in LD-SCLC. Especially, downstaging is useful for further stratification of patients achieving PR. Additional treatments after CRT may be needed for the patients who achieving PR without downstaging.",Excluded

[Chinese] METHODS: The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed in 59 patients with DAVF treated with Onyx embolization using long-distance injection method (28 patients) and routine injection method (31 patients). The efficacy, safety, injection time and radiation exposure during Onyx embolization were compared between the two injections methods. RESULTS: The average radiation dose exposure to the surgeon per procedure was significantly lower in the long-distance injection group than in the routine group. The injection time (P=0.53), injection volume (P=0.78), number of supply arteries (P=0.80), Cognard types (P=0.67), and effect of embolization (P=0.88) were all similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Endovaseular treatment of intracranial DAVF with Onyx embolization using the long-distance injection method is feasible, safe and effective and can reduce the radiation exposure to the surgeon. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, clinical characteristics, safety, injection time and radiation exposure of Onyx embolization using a long-distance injection method and routine injection method for management of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF).",Excluded
1726,"Variation of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer birefringence in normal human subjects PURPOSE: The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) exhibits linear birefringence due to the oriented cylindrical structure of ganglion cell axons. The birefringence (Deltan) depends on the density and composition of axonal organelles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distribution of birefringence around the optic nerve head (ONH) in normal subjects.METHODS: Birefringence was calculated along circular scan paths around the ONH as Deltan = R/T, where R is RNFL retardance measured by scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) and T is RNFL thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT scans on a 3.4 mm diameter circle were obtained from 26 normal subjects aged 18 to 53 years. Scans on circles with various diameters were obtained from 17 of these subjects.RESULTS: The average reproducibility of Deltan measured on three separate days in four subjects was +/- 0.05 nm/microm. In most subjects Deltan varied significantly along a circular path around the ONH, with maxima in superior and inferior bundles, minima temporally and nasally, and a mean of 0.32 +/- 0.03 nm/microm. Deltan profiles on circles of different diameter were similar, suggesting that Deltan did not vary along nerve fiber bundles.CONCLUSIONS: RNFL birefringence varies with position around the ONH. This variation may result from known structural differences among nerve fiber bundles that serve different retinal regions. Constant Deltan along bundles is consistent with this hypothesis. Measurements of RNFL birefringence may provide a means to detect early subcellular changes in glaucoma.",Excluded
1350,"Reproducibility of patient positioning during routine radiotherapy, as assessed by an integrated megavoltage imaging system A portal imaging system has been used, in conjunction with a movie measurement technique to measure set-up errors for 15 patients treated with radiotherapy of the pelvis and for 12 patients treated with radiotherapy of the brain. The pelvic patients were treated without fixation devices and the brain patients were treated with individually-moulded plastic shells. As would be expected the brain treatments were found to be more accurate than the pelvic treatments. Results are presented in terms of five error types: random error from treatment to treatment, error between mean treatment position and simulation position, random simulation error, systematic simulator-to-treatment errors and total treatment error. For the brain patients the simulation-to-treatment error predominates and random treatment errors were small (95% < or = 3 mm, 77% < or = 1.5 mm). Vector components of the systematic simulation-to-treatment errors were 1-2 mm with maximal random simulation error of +/- 5 mm (2 S.D.). There is much interest in the number of verification films necessary to evaluate treatment accuracy. These results indicate that one check film performed at the first treatment is likely to be sufficient for set-up evaluation. For the pelvis the random treatment error is larger (95% < or = 4.5 mm, 87% < or = 3 mm). The systematic simulation-to-treatment error is up to 3 mm and the maximal random simulation error is +/- 6 mm (2 S.D.). Thus corrections made solely on the basis of a first day check film may not be sufficient for adequate set-up evaluation.",Excluded

1461,"[Acoustic neuroma in Iceland for 30 years (1979-2009)] INTRODUCTION: Acoustic neuroma (AN) is a tumor of the 8th cranial nerve. The goal of this study was to find the incidence of AN in Iceland from 1979 - 2009 as well as investigate other epidemiological factors.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group of patients with the AN diagnosis was gathered retrospectively through medical records. We looked at several epidemiological factors including age and symptoms at diagnosis, and the treatment chosen for each individual.RESULTS: The incidence rate of AN in Iceland is 1.24/100,000. About 10% of diagnosed tumors were found incidentally. Most of those were found in the last 10 years of the investigation and in that period fewer large and giant tumors at diagnosis. Present complaints of patients at diagnosis were hearing loss (69%), dysequilibrium/dizziness (47%) and tinnitus (43%). Treatments were surgery (n=47), observation (n=30) and gamma knife radiosurgery (n=16). We had information concerning postoperative hearing loss and facial paralysis in 39 patients who underwent surgery. Loss of hearing postoperatively occurred in 69% (n=27) and 44% (n=17) had facial paralysis. For an average of 3.5 years, 17% of tumors followed by imaging grew.CONCLUSION: The incidence of AN is similar to that in Europe and is increasing. More tumors are found incidentally. Small tumors can be followed by regular imaging, at least for the short term. Larger tumors are treated by surgery or gamma knife radiosurgery. A high percentage of patients receiving surgery lost their hearing postoperatively.",Included
1844,"Textiloma mimicking a recurrent high-grade astrocytoma Introduction: Textiloma (Txm) is defined as a foreign body-related inflammatory pseudotumor arising from retained nonabsorbable cotton matrix with the associated inflammatory reaction. In current neurosurgical practice, Txm often refers to a resorbable hemostatic agent that is intentionally left in place to prevent the potentially disastrous consequences of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage. Imaging is essential to the workup for Txm, but it cannot be easily distinguished from a recurrent tumor or abscess due to their nonspecific characteristics. Parameter calculations of diffusion weighted imaging are based on complex pharmacokinetic compartment models that allow only an approximation of the biological conditions. This report describes a case of a Txm mimicking a recurrent high-grade astrocytoma including altered advanced neuroimaging techniques in an effort to highlight this possibility in the setting of tumoral recurrence. Materials And Methods: A 69-year-old female presented to our facility with a 6-month history of progressive left-sided weakness. Neuroimaging studies revealed a large non-enhancing mass in the right frontoparietal lobe. Pathology reported a diffuse astrocytoma, WHO grade II with wildtype IDH-1, EGFR amplification and PTEN negative results. After surgical intervention, external beam radiation was given to the remaining areas of residual tumor. Routine MRI revealed a nodular area of contrast enhancement in the dorsal and inferior margin of the biopsy tract, growing between interval scans, perfusion-weighted imaging parameters were elevated, clinically asymptomatic. Result(s): She underwent a complete resection of this area of interest and pathology returned as a Txm with surgicel fibers. Reactive changes were also seen consistent with radiation effect and areas of atypical cells consistent with residual tumor but not significantly mitotically active. She did notrequire any further treatments and was on observation with imaging only for 14 months until another area of progression was seen. Conclusion(s): After treatment of a neoplasm, if unexpected clinical or imaging evidence of recurrence is present, it may be a foreign body reaction to hemostatic material used during the initial surgery. The implications of this case lie in recognizing this entity to avoid unnecessary procedures. Given the technical variability of advanced MRI techniques, there are limits to the sensitivity and specificity of such. The standardization of advanced MRI is well recognized as a pressing clinical and research need.",Excluded

Previously, we have shown that in the cells of patients with AT simultaneously two oppositely-directed development programs are proceeding: accelerated aging or the rise of the classical markers of aging number, such as the SA-beta-ga1, SAHF, HP1-gamma, gamma-H2AX, 53BP; and transformation or a sharp decline in the effectiveness of DNA repair processes and a high level of chromosomal rearrangements.<sup>1,2,3</sup> The cause of the disease is a mutation in the protein kinase ATM localized on chromosome 11 (11q22.3).<sup>4</sup> Up until now more than 80 mutations (on the locations of which the severity of the disease is dependent) resulting in the development of AT on this gene have been described.<sup>5</sup> Basing on the dynamics of the process of repair after gamma irradiation we can determine not only the presence of the AT syndrome, but its heterozygous.

2146,"Localization of glutathione and induction of glutathione synthesis-related proteins in mouse brain by low doses of gamma-rays First, we determined the cerebral localization of reduced glutathione (GSH) in normal mice by means of autoradiography using 99mTc-meso-hexamethyl propylene oxime. A highly specific localization of GSH in the cerebellum and hippocampus was observed. Secondly, we measured the elevation of GSH level in the brain after low-dose gamma-irradiation. The cerebral GSH levels increased soon after irradiation with 50 cGy of gamma-rays, reaching a maximum at 3 h post-treatment, then remaining significantly higher than that of the non-irradiated control until 12 h and returning to the control level by 24 h. Thirdly, we examined the induction of the activities and the mRNAs of proteins involved in the synthesis and regeneration of GSH in the brain of mice subjected to low-dose gamma-ray irradiation. The level of mRNA for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase was significantly increased at 0.5 h, and remained high until 2 h post-irradiation (50 cGy). The level was transiently lowered to the non-irradiated control level at 3 h and slightly increased again after 6 h post-irradiation. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was significantly increased 3 h after irradiation, and remained high up to 24 h post-irradiation. As for glutathione reductase, the mRNA level was increased at 0.5 h, and peaked strongly at 2 h, while the enzyme activity was significantly increased at 6 h after irradiation, and continued to increase up to 24 h. The level of mRNA for thioredoxin, which contributes to GSH biosynthesis by supplying cysteine to the de novo pathway, peaked between 0.5 h and 2 h post-irradiation, and rapidly declined thereafter. The content of thioredoxin showed a transient decrease immediately after irradiation, but was then remarkably elevated, reaching a maximum at 3 h, and thereafter declining sharply. These results indicate that the increase in endogenous GSH in mouse brain soon after low-dose gamma-ray irradiation is a consequence of the induction of GSH synthesis-related proteins and occurs via both the de novo synthesis and the regeneration pathways.",Included
1276,"Comparative study of anatomical connectivity of prelemniscal radiations in healthy subjects and Parkinso's disease patients Objective: Characterize the anatomic connectivity of prelemniscal radiations (Raprl) and identify differences in the fiber populations that conform the Raprl using probabilistic tractography. Background(s): The Raprl have been proposed as a neurosurgical target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of PD since 1970's. Despite its clinical usefulness the anatomic connectivity of the Raprl remains unknown. Method(s): Images from 12 healthy subjects and 6 PD patients were acquired using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner. Diffusionweighted images were acquired using 120 unique diffusion-gradient directions with beta=2000s/mm2 (voxel size of 2x2x2mm3). Constrained spherical deconvolution was performed, followed by the creation of track-density images using MRtrix (Brain Research Institute Australia), resulting in final resolution of 0.2x0.2x0.2mm3; these images were crucial for the accurate manual segmentation of subthalamic structures. We seeded 50000 streamlines at the level of the Raprl, differences of streamlines interconnecting the Raprl between groups were assessed by Student's t-test. Result(s): All subjects showed Raprl connectivity with cortical and subcortical structures, when these fiber bundles enter the posterior limb of internal capsule they show a clear spatial organization according to their targets, from anterior to posterior as follows: 1) orbitofrontal cortex, 2) globus pallidus (GP) 3) supplementary motor area and 4) primary motor cortex and cerebellum. In 87.5% of healthy subjects GP showed connectivity with the contralateral dorsal brainstem in a region that corresponds to the location of the contralateral pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), the same connectivity pattern is present in 83.3% of PD patients. The number of reconstructed streamlines obtained showed differences between groups in the connectivity to pallidum (left p=0.017, right p=0.045) and in thalamus (left p=0.02, right p=0.006). Conclusion(s): PD patients that have undergone Raprl-DBS show an improvement on gait that also occurs after unilateral GP-DBS, which could be explained because of the bilateral connections from Raprl to PPN through fibers crossing the midline at lower midbrain. Our findings provide new insights into subthalamic connectivity that allow explaining clinical benefits obtained after Raprl-DBS.",Excluded
1360,"MIBG thyroid uptake Background-Aim: Cardiac sympathetic innervation imaging by 123I-MIBG has been widely adopted in evaluating Pts affected by congestive heart failure (CHF) to assess prognosis, response to treatment, risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death and prediction of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy. The same tracer has been used in patients with neurological disease to assess the state of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system at a post-ganglionic level that is altered in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), even without clinical signs of dysautonomia, and normal in other Parkinsonism such as multisystem atrophy (MSA). Both cardiological and neurological pts are pretreated with Lugol's oral solution and/or potassium perchlorate to prevent thyroid uptake of unlabeled 123I and to limit the thyroid radiation exposure. However, despite the inhibition of the iodide pump a thyroid visualization is frequently observed in MIBG scans in pts imaged for cardiac or neurological disorders. Recently a pt with hyperthyroidism, normal calcitonin level and CHF came to our observation for MIBG imaging. There was a high thyroid uptake of the tracer despite he was on therapy with Amiodarone. A scan with 123I-Iodide confirmed the absence of any uptake. Aim of the study was the evaluation of the thyroid uptake in pts undergone to 123I-MIBG scan for CHF and movement disorders. Method(s): We have reviewed the 123I-MIBG scintigraphies of 57 pts recruited in three different centres (Brescia, Castelfranco Veneto and Veruno) who were imaged at 15' and 4 h and in whom the thyroid was included in the field of view of the thorax. 42 pts underwent MIBG imaging for cardiological purposes and 15 for neurological disorders. 2/3 centres pretreated the pts with Lugol's oral solution and/or potassium perchlorate and one centre did not and the pts were referred as control group. The following parameters were evaluated. Tracer wash out from heart (HWO) and thyroid (TWO), heart to mediastinum ratio (H/M), thyroid to mediastinum ratio (T/M) at 15' and 4 h Results: In the cardiac pts HWO was 23 +/- 7.2 % and TWO was 11.4 +/- 8.2 % (p<.0001). The TWO was 12.2 +/- 13.4 % in centres 1 and 2 and 10.05 +/- 8.97 % in centre 3 (control group), p = n.s. The T/M ratio was 1.37 +/- 0.17 in Centre 1-2 and 1.3 +/- 0.35 in Centre 3 p = n.s. (Control group- no pretreatment). In neurological pts the HWO was 26 +/- 8.1 % and the TWO was 20,32c6,41, p<.05. The difference in TWO was statistically significant (p<.01) between cardiological and neurological pts, whereas the HWO was not (p = ns). The 4 h H/M was 1.49 +/- 0.23 in cardiological pts and 1.4 +/- 0.39 in neurological pts (p = n.s.) The 4 h T/M was 1.33 +/- 0.3 in cardiological pts and 1.15 +/- 0.13 in neurological pts (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the thyroid visualization in MIBG imaging is not related to accumulation of 123I-iodide but to 123IMIBG uptake as an expression of thyroid sympathetic innervation. On the basis of our observation pretreatment with Lugol's oral solution and/or potassium perchlorate is therefore not justified and the procedure guidelines should be revised. Different values of TWO and T/M ratio in cardiological and neurological disorders probably express a different attitude of thyroid dopaminergic receptors in more generalized sympathetic disorder in Parkinson's disease rather than an activation of the sympatho-adrenergic system in CHF.",Excluded

1292,"Role for ATM in DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1 The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia is characterized by immunodeficiency, progressive cerebellar ataxia, radiosensitivity, cell cycle checkpoint defects, and cancer predisposition. The gene product [ataxia-telangiectasia mutation (ATM)] mutated in this syndrome is a component of the DNA damage detection pathway. Loss of ATM function in human and mouse cells causes defects in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control and, not surprisingly, humans and mice with compromised ATM function are prone to cancers. An excess of breast cancer in the relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia patients has also been reported by epidemiological studies. Predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers is also observed in women with germline mutations in BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene. BRCA1 is a nuclear protein with a cell cycle-regulated expression pattern and is hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA-damaging agents. Here we show that rapid ionizing radiation-induced in vivo phosphorylation of BRCA1 requires the presence of functional ATM protein. Furthermore, we show that ATM interacts with BRCA1, and this association is enhanced by radiation. We also demonstrate that BRCA1 is a substrate of ATM kinase in vitro and in vivo. Using phospho-specific antibodies against serines 1387, 1423, and 1457 of BRCA1, we demonstrate radiation-induced, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA1 at these sites. These findings show that BRCA1 is regulated by an ATM-dependent mechanism as a part of the cellular response to DNA damage. This interaction between ATM and BRCA1 argues in favor of the involvement of particular aspects of ATM function in breast cancer predisposition.",Excluded

However, the implementation of CT-angiography does not always exclude the necessity of conventional angiography. Our objective was to determine the practical utility and cost-effectiveness of CT-angiography.METHODS: All patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted to our university hospital after implementation of CT-angiography between June 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012 were retrospectively analyzed in regard to factors of treatment flow, radiation exposure, harms of contrast medium loading, and diagnostic costs. A control group of the same size was assembled from previously admitted SAH patients, who did not undergo pretreatment CT-angiography. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analysis was performed.RESULTS: The final analysis consisted of 93 patients in each group. Of 93 patients with pretreatment CT-angiography, 74 had to undergo conventional angiography for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. CT-angiography had significant impact on the reduction of collective effective radiation dose by 4.419 mSv per person (p = 0.0002) and was not associated with additional harms. Despite the significantly earlier detection of aneurysms with CT-angiography (p < 0.0001), there were no significant differences in the timing of aneurysm repair and duration of ICU and general hospital stay. There was an increase of diagnostic costs-the cost-effectiveness analysis showed, however, that benefits of CT-angiography in respect to radiation exposure and risk of conventional angiography-related complications justify the additional costs of CT-angiography.CONCLUSIONS: Although the implementation of CT-angiography in SAH diagnosis cannot completely replace conventional angiography, it can be approved in regard to radiation hygiene and cost-effectiveness.",Excluded
1208,"Inhibition decorrelates visual feature representations in the inner retina The retina extracts visual features for transmission to the brain. Different types of bipolar cell split the photoreceptor input into parallel channels and provide the excitatory drive for downstream visual circuits. Mouse bipolar cell types have been described at great anatomical and genetic detail, but a similarly deep understanding of their functional diversity is lacking. Here, by imaging light-driven glutamate release from more than 13,000 bipolar cell axon terminals in the intact retina, we show that bipolar cell functional diversity is generated by the interplay of dendritic excitatory inputs and axonal inhibitory inputs. The resulting centre and surround components of bipolar cell receptive fields interact to decorrelate bipolar cell output in the spatial and temporal domains. Our findings highlight the importance of inhibitory circuits in generating functionally diverse excitatory pathways and suggest that decorrelation of parallel visual pathways begins as early as the second synapse of the mouse visual system.",Excluded

The mutant enzyme catalyze the reduction of a-ketoglutaric acid to D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid, leading to cancer initiation. In this study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of SYC-435 (1-hydroxypyridin-2-one), a newly developed mutant IDH1inhibitor, both in vitro and in vivo in IDH1 mutant gliomas as compared with IDH1 wild type GBMs. Method(s): An established neurosphere line (BT142) of anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA), and a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of recurrent AOA (ICV0914AOA), and 2 PDOX models of GBM (IC-4687GBM and IC-3752GBM) were included. IDH1 mutations (R132H and R132C) were analyzed by pyrosequencing. To determine the in vitro antitumor activities, tumor cells were exposed to SYC-435 (0.02 to 20 [iM) and examining for changes of cell proliferation every 3-4 days till day 13 by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. For in vivo effects, orthotopic xenograft mouse models of IC-BT142AOA and IC-V0914AOA were treated with vehicle (as control), SYC-435 (i.p., 15 mg/kg/day x 28 days), temozolomide (TMZ, oral, 50 mg/kg/day x 5 days) + fractionated radiation (XRT, 2 Gy/day x 5 days) (as standard therapy), and combination of SYC-435 with standard therapy starting 2 weeks after intracranial tumor implantation. Animal survival times were analyzed by log rank analysis. Result(s): IDH1 R132H mutation (homozygous) was detected in BT142AOA neurosphere line and R132C mutation (mutant allele frequency 39-42%) in IC-V0914AOA xenograft cells, while the two GBM models (IC-4687GBM and IC-3752GBM) carried wild-type IDH1. Suppression of cell growth was observed in time- and dosedependent manner by SYC-435, particularly at the IDH1 mutant models. At 0.5 ^M, SYC-435 inhibited cell growth by 90% in BT142 and 60% in IC-V0914AOA cells, whereas in IDH wild-type GBMs only by 17% in IC-4687GBM and 19% in IC-3752GBM cells at day 13, indicating the high selectivity of SYC-435 of mutant over wild type IDH1. Systematic in vivo treatment with SYC-435 alone did not alter survival times in neither IC-BT142AOA nor IC-V0914AOA models when compared with the control group. Although standard therapy significantly prolonged animal survival times in both models (P<0.0005), combining SYC-435 with standard therapies further extended the median survival times from 106 days (in the standard therapy group) to 124 days (P<0.05) in IC-V0914AOA and exhibited similar trend in IC-BT142AOA.

TMS produced one dip in awareness 60-120 ms after stimulus onset, while forced-choice orientation discrimination was suppressed between 60 and 90 ms and symbol discrimination between 60 and 120 ms. Thus, a time window specific to visual awareness was found only in the orientation condition at 120 ms. The results imply that both conscious and unconscious perception depend on activity in early visual areas.

Both sensitisers showed intracellular localisation to discrete organelle sites and exhibited considerably less 'dark' cytotoxicity than HpD. The kinetics of uptake of porphyrins 7 and 8 was studied in the mouse C6 glioma model as well as in biopsy samples from normal brain, liver, spleen and blood. Maximal drug uptake levels in tumour occurred 9 and 6 h after intraperitoneal injection for 7 and 8 respectively, at which time the tumour to normal brain ratios were 15:1 and 13:1 respectively. The effect of PDT using porphyrin 7 activated by the gold metal vapour laser tuned to 627.8 nm was studied in Wistar rats bearing intracerebral C6 glioma. At a drug dose of 10 mg porphyrin 7 kg-1 body weight and laser doses of up to 400 J cm-2 light, selective tumour kill with sparing of normal brain was achieved, with a maximal depth of tumour kill of 1.77+/-0.40. mm. Irradiation following a higher drug dose of 75 mg porphyrin 7 kg-1 body weight resulted in a greater depth of tumour kill, but also significantly increased the likelihood and extent of necrosis in normal brain.",Excluded
1762,The effect of laser hemotherapy on the acid glycosaminoglycan content of the liver and blood plasma in rats in the dynamics of an alcoholic coma. [Russian] The aim of the study was determination of the content of acid glycosaminoglicans (GAG) in hepatic tissue and blood plasma of rats in the course of alcoholic coma and in response to laser irradiation of venous blood. The alcoholic intoxication was achieved by introduction of 40% ethanol through a metal probe into the stomach. The content of acid GAG was defined according to Diche. Alcoholic coma caused reduction of GAG levels in hepatic tissue and an increase in blood plasma which were correlated with the severity of neurological state. Laser irradiation of venous blood promoted a trend to normalization of GAG content in the investigated tissues. A relative reduction in GAG plasma levels after laser hemotherapy indicates effectiveness of the conducted therapy.,Excluded
2116,"Neurointerventionalist and Patient Radiation Doses in Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke PURPOSE: To evaluate the patient and the neurointerventionalist radiation dose levels during endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and to analyze factors affecting doses.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 2017 to January 2019, we prospectively collected patient radiation data and neurointerventionalist data from real-time dosimetry from all consecutive thrombectomies. Multivariate analysis was performed to analyze patient total dose area product (DAP) and neurointerventionalist dose variability in terms of clinical characteristics and the technical parameters of thrombectomies. Local dose reference levels (RL) were derived as the 75th percentile of the patient dose distributions.RESULTS: A total of 179 patients were treated during the study period and included in this study. Local dose RL for thrombectomy was derived for total DAP to 34 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>, cumulative air kerma of 242 mGy and fluoroscopy time of 12 min. The mean neurointerventionalist dose for thrombectomy was 7.7 +/- 7.4 microSv. Height (P = 0.018), weight (P = 0.004), body mass index (P = 0.015), puncture to recanalisation (P < 0.001), fluoro time (P < 0.001), number of passes (P < 0.001), thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b/3 recanalisation (P = 0.034) and aspiration thrombectomy (P < 0.001) were independent factors affecting patient total DAP, whereas baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (P = 0.043), puncture to recanalisation (P = 0.003), fluoroscopy time (P = 0.009) and number of passes (P = 0.009) were factors affecting the neurointerventionalist dose.CONCLUSION: New reference patient doses lower than those in previously published studies were defined.

2003,"Clinical analysis of the approximate, 3-dimensional, biological effective dose equation in multiphase treatment plans A multiphase, approximate biological effective dose (BED<inf>A</inf>) equation was introduced because most treatment planning systems (TPS) are incapable of calculating the true BED (BED<inf>T</inf>). This work investigates the accuracy and precision of the multiphase BED<inf>A</inf> relative to the BED<inf>T</inf> in clinical cases. Ten patients with head and neck cancer and 10 patients with prostate cancer were studied using their treatment plans from Pinnacle<sup>3</sup> 9.2 (Philips Medical, Fitchburg, WI). The organs at risk (OARs) that were studied are the normal brain, left and right optic nerves, optic chiasm, spinal cord, brainstem, bladder, and rectum. BED<inf>A</inf> and BED<inf>T</inf> distributions were calculated using MATLAB 2010b (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and analyzed on a voxel basis for percent error, percent error volume histograms (PEVHs), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman analysis. The maximum BED values that were calculated using the BED<inf>A</inf> and BED<inf>T</inf> methods were also analyzed. BED<inf>A</inf> was found to always underestimate BED<inf>T</inf>. The accuracy and precision of BED<inf>A</inf> distributions varied between the organs: for optic chiasm and brainstem, 50% of the patients had an overall BED<inf>A</inf> percent error of <1%; for left and right optic nerves, rectum, and bladder, 60% to 70% of the patients had an overall BED<inf>A</inf> percent error of <1%; and for normal brain and spinal cord, 80% of the patients had an overall BED<inf>A</inf> percent error of <1%. BED<inf>A</inf> distributions had maximum errors ranging from 2% to 11%, with the 11% error occurring for bladder. BED<inf>A</inf> produced much more accurate maximum BED values with adjacent organs such as normal brain, bladder, and rectum.

2265,"Effective techniques for reduction of radiation dosage to patients undergoing invasive cardiac procedures The goal of this study was to improve radiation dose reduction techniques in invasive cardiology and after patients' radiation data had approached minimal levels, to evaluate predictors of their radiation exposure resulting from invasive cardiac procedures. Over the course of 1 year (and 1996 procedures) we minimized cinegraphic frames and runs, as well as fluoroscopy time, and trained ourselves to achieve effective fluoroscopy-saving positioning of blinds and filters toward the regions of interest. We were consequently able to reduce the mean dose-area products (DAP) for coronary angiography and angioplasty, combined interventions, high-frequency rotational atherectomy, and excimer laser angioplasty: from levels of 53.9 Gy cm(2), 79.6 Gy cm(2), 112.3 Gy cm(2), 119.4 Gy cm(2), and 168.0 Gy cm(2) as currently reported in the literature, to 12.9 Gy cm(2), 13.3 Gy cm(2), 25.9 Gy cm(2), 33.0 Gy cm(2), and 27.1 Gy cm(2), respectively. The mean DAP due to interventions in acute myocardial infarction was 38.3 Gy cm(2). DAP was influenced by body mass index, complexity of coronary artery disease, tube angulation, documented structure, coronary recanalization, emergency circumstances, and the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) target vessel involved, but not by stent implantation. By favouring radiation-reducing cranial posteroanterior views over standard left anterior oblique views for visualization of the left anterior descending and the diagonal artery, we consequently achieved mean PTCA-DAPs of 10.4 Gy cm(2) and 8.6 Gy cm(2), respectively: levels significantly lower than those for PTCA of the right coronary artery (13.3 Gy cm(2)), left circumflex artery (13.7 Gy cm(2)), and obtuse marginal branch (16.9 Gy cm(2)).

1610,"COX-2 expression in the guinea pig cochlea is partly altered by moderate sound exposure The cyclooxygenase-2 isoform (COX-2) was found recently to be constitutively expressed in the guinea pig inner ear. To gain knowledge about its role in sound perception, alterations in the COX-2 level of moderate noise-stimulated cochleae were determined. Staining intensities were quantified in different regions using an immunohistochemical staining procedure and computer-assisted system. After 70 dB and 90 dB noise exposure for 1 h at 8000 Hz, COX-2 downregulation was observed in the organ of Corti, which was most prominent in Deiters' cells near Hensen cells and outer hair cells. In pillar cells, COX-2 levels were only slightly reduced after 70 dB but strongly diminished after 90 dB exposure. In Hensen cells, COX-2 was downregulated after 70 dB stimulation, revealing a decreasing COX-2 content from the third to the first turn of the cochlea and a homogeneously reduced enzyme expression in all three turns after 90 dB. The COX-2 content in inner hair cells was nearly identical to unexposed cochleae after 70 dB exposure but significantly reduced after 90 dB stimulation. In spiral ganglion cells, stria vascularis, spiral ligament and limbus, COX-2 expression was unchanged after 70 dB and 90 dB. We suggest that alterations in COX-2 expression might contribute to diminished sensitivity at the cochlea after noise exposure to reduce subsequent noise distress, termed sound conditioning.",Excluded
2004,"Extracranial radiosurgery (stereotactic body radiation therapy) for oligometastases Extracranial radiosurgery, also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), is an increasingly used method of treatment of limited cancer metastases located in a variety of organs/sites including the spine, lungs, liver, and other areas in the abdomen and pelvis. The techniques used to perform SBRT were initially modeled after intracranial radiosurgery, although considerable evolution in technique and conduct has occurred for extracranial applications. Unlike intracranial radiosurgery, SBRT requires characterization and accounting for inherent organ movement including breathing motion. Potent dose hypofractionation schedules have been used with SBRT such that the treatment is generally both ablative and convenient. Because the treatment is severely damaging to tissues within and about the target, the volume of adjacent normal tissue must be strictly minimized to avoid toxic late effects. Outcomes in various sites show very high rates of local control with toxicity mostly related to tubular tissues like the airways and bowels. With proper conduct though, SBRT can be an extremely effective treatment option for oligometastases. [References: 67]",Excluded

Multinomial logistic regression and one-way analyses of variance were used to examine the differences among subgroups.MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Depressed mood, cognitive disturbance, fatigue, insomnia, pain, and functional performance.FINDINGS: Patients were classified into four distinct subgroups based on their symptom cluster experience: all low symptom, high fatigue and low pain, high pain, and all high symptom. Such patient classification patterns were consistent across the treatment trajectory, although group memberships were inconsistent. After initiating treatment, two additional subgroups emerged: high depressed mood and cognitive disturbance, and high fatigue and insomnia. Subgroups differed in physical performance status at baseline, symptom burden, and treatment modality in a relatively consistent pattern across time points. Patients in the all-high-symptom subgroup experienced the most serious limitations in activities across all time points.CONCLUSIONS: Patient subgroups exist that share the unique experience of psychoneurologic symptoms.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Findings are useful to determine who needs more intensive symptom management during cancer treatment. Future studies should examine whether specific symptom management strategies are more efficient for certain subgroups.",Excluded

Irinotecan/cisplatin have been shown to be superior to a standard treatment with etoposide/cisplatin in extensive disease SCLC. The present phase I study aims to assess the feasibility of irinotecan/cisplatin administered concurrently with radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients were treated concurrently with conventional fractionated radiotherapy (1.8-45 Gy + 9 Gy (RP)) and two cycles of irinotecan (40/50/60 mg/m2, Day 1/8/15, 29/36/43) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2, Days 1-3, 29-31), and four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy (CT). In addition, patients in complete remission (CR) received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any case grade III/IV non-hematological toxicity (esophagitis grade IV), grade IV leukopenia or grades III/IV thrombopenia (CTC) during RCT.RESULTS: No DLT was observed; an irinotecan dose of 60 mg/m2 is recommended. 3/12 patients developed grade III leukopenia, one grade II pneumonitis. The predominant toxicity was esophagitis, grade II in 7/12 patients, grade III in 5/12.

At the time of diagnosis, the mean tumor depth was 3.7 mm (+/-SD:1.6 mm). The mean dose at the tumor apex was 141.4 Gy (+/- SD: 12.1 Gy) and 557.7 Gy (+/- SD: 257.3 Gy) to the sclera.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 69.5 months (+/- SD: 53.8 months). Thirty-four patients (87.1%) remained free of recurrence. Twenty-six patients (66.7%) demonstrated a complete tumor regression after a median period of 12 months (3-60 mon.). By the final examination, the visual acuity of 26 patients (66.7%) was better than 20/200, and 12 patients (30.7%) had a visual acuity better than 20/40. Retinopathy was detected in 11 patients (28.2%). After treatments only one patient (5.1%) had active vascular changes by the last examination. Moderate optic neuropathy was observed in 4 patients (10.3%). Cataract development was diagnosed in 21 patients (53.8%), and 16 patients (41%) had bilateral cataract development.

2019,"Neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in a psychopathological animal model are suggestive of antidepressant-like effects The neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) were investigated in two rat lines selectively bred for high and low anxiety-related behavior. The stimulation parameters were adjusted according to the results of accurate computer-assisted and magnetic resonance imaging-based reconstructions of the current density distributions induced by rTMS in the rat and human brain, ensuring comparable stimulation patterns in both cases. Adult male rats were treated in two 3-day series under halothane anesthesia. In the forced swim test, rTMS-treatment induced a more active coping strategy in the high anxiety-related behavior rats only (time spent struggling; 332% vs. controls), allowing these animals to reach the performance of low anxiety-related behavior rats. In contrast, rTMS-treated low anxiety-related behavior rats did not change their swimming behavior. The development of active coping strategies in high anxiety-related behavior rats was accompanied by a significantly attenuated stress-induced elevation of plasma corticotropin and corticosterone concentrations. In summary, the behavioral and neuroendocrine effects of rTMS of frontal brain regions in high anxiety-related behavior rats are comparable to the effects of antidepressant drug treatment. Interestingly, in the psychopathological animal model repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induced changes in stress coping abilities in the high-anxiety line only.",Excluded

1690,"Distinct functional domains of Nbs1 modulate the timing and magnitude of ATM activation after low doses of ionizing radiation The ATM kinase is a tumour suppressor and a key activator of genome integrity checkpoints in mammalian cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) and other insults that elicit DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In response to IR, autophosphorylation on serine 1981 causes dissociation of ATM dimers and initiates cellular ATM kinase activity. Here, we show that the kinetics and magnitude of ATM Ser1981 phosphorylation after exposure of human fibroblasts to low doses (2 Gy) of IR are altered in cells deficient in Nbs1, a substrate of ATM and a component of the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex involved in processing/repair of DSBs and ATM-dependent cell cycle checkpoints. Timely phosphorylation of both ATM Ser1981 and the ATM substrate Smc1 after IR were rescued via retrovirally mediated reconstitution of Nbs1-deficient cells by wild-type Nbs1 or mutants of Nbs1 defective in the FHA domain or nonphosphorylatable by ATM, but not by Nbs1 lacking the Mre11-interaction domain. Our data indicate that apart from its role downstream of ATM in the DNA damage checkpoint network, the MRN complex serves also as a modulator/amplifier of ATM activity. Although not absolutely required for ATM activation, the MRN nuclease complex may help reach the threshold activity of ATM necessary for optimal genome maintenance and prevention of cancer.",Excluded

At 2 months post-irradiation, cellular markers of inflammation (total, activated, and newborn microglia) and neurogenesis (newborn neurons) were measured in 40 mum sections of the dentate gyrus (DG).RESULTS: Although the total number of microglia in the DG/hilus was not significantly different (p > 0.7) in unirradiated, single dose, and fWBI rats, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.003) increase in the percent-activated microglia; fWBI did not (p > 0.1). Additionally, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.002) dose-dependent increase in surviving newborn microglia; fWBI did not (p < 0.8). Although total proliferation in the DG was reduced equally by single and fWBI doses, single doses produced a significant dose-dependent (p < 0.02) decrease in surviving newborn neurons; fWBI did not (p > 0.6).CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the rat brain's cellular response to single doses often does not predict its cellular response to 'biologically equivalent' fWBI doses.",Included
1504,"Nontraumatic vascular emergencies: Imaging and intervention in acute occlusion Risk factors for acute venous occlusion range from prolonged immobilization to hypercoagulability syndromes, trauma, and malignancy. The aim of this review article is to illustrate the different imaging options for the diagnosis of acute venous occlusion and to assess the value of interventional strategies for venous thrombosis treatment in an emergency setting. First, diagnosis and treatment of the most common form of venous occlusion, at the level of the lower extremities, is presented, followed by pelvic vein and inferior vena cava occlusion, mesenteric venous thrombosis, upper extremity occlusion, acute cerebral vein thrombosis, and finally acute venous occlusion of hemodialysis access. In acute venous occlusion of the lower extremity phlebography is still the reference gold standard. Presently, duplex ultrasound with manual compression is the most sensitive and specific noninvasive test. Limitations of ultrasonography include isolated distal calf vein occlusion, obesity, and patients with lower extremity edema. If sonography is non-diagnostic, venography should be considered. Magnetic resonance venography can differentiate an acute occlusion from chronic thrombus, but because of its high cost and limited availability, it is not yet used for the routine diagnosis of lower extremity venous occlusion only. Regarding interventional treatment, catheter-directed thrombolysis can be applied to dissolve thrombus in charily selected patients with symptomatic occlusion and no contraindications to therapy. Acute occlusion of the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava, often due to extension from the femoropopliteal system, represents a major risk for pulmonary embolism. Color flow Doppler imaging is often limited owing to obesity and bowel gas. Venography has long been considered the gold standard for identifying proximal venous occlusion. Both CT scanning and MR imaging, however, can even more accurately diagnose acute pelvis vein or inferior vena cava occlusion. MRI is preferred because it is noninvasive, does not require contrast agent, carries no exposure to ionizing radiation, and is highly accurate and reproducible. Apart from catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy has proven to be a quick and safe treatment modality by enabling the recanalization of thrombotic occlusions in conjunction with minimal invasiveness and a low bleeding risk. Mechanical thrombectomy devices should only be used in conjunction with a temporary cava filter. Contrast-enhanced CT is at present considered the examination of choice for acute mesenteric vein occlusion which has mortality rates as high as 80%. Patients with proven acute mesenteric venous occlusion and contraindications to surgical therapy and no identified bleeding disposition without looming bowel ischemia or infarction are possible contenders to the less invasive percutaneous approach either by (in)direct thrombolysis or mechanical means. Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of upper extremity thrombosis. Computed tomography and MRI are in addition helpful in diagnosing central chest vein occlusions. The interventionalist is rarely involved in the treatment of this entity. Catheter-directed thrombolysis is known to improve lysis rates. Together with balloon angioplasty good results have been obtained. If stenosis or thrombus remains after thrombolysis and angioplasty, stent placement should follow. Within the first two weeks, thrombosed dural sinus and cerebral venous vessels are typically hyperdense on CT compared with brain parenchyma; after the course of 2 weeks, the thrombus will become isodense. In MRI an axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, an axial diffusion-weighted MRI, coronal T1-weighted spinecho and T2-weighted turbo-spinecho sequences, a coronal gradientecho and a 3D phase-contrast venous angiogram should be performed. Local thrombolysis is needed only when patients have an exacerbation of clinical symptoms or imaging signs of worsening disease despite sufficient anticoagulation therapy. Acute occlusions of dialysis grafts and fistulae are a frequently encountered complication. Among the various methods described for acute occlusion screening, ultrasonography and MRI have been proven to be accurate and noninvasive; however, if immediate treatment can be anticipated, imaging should be performed directly by digital subtraction angiography before the percutaneous intervention. Initial percutaneous thrombectomy is very effective with success rates and patency rates comparable to those of surgical thrombectomy. A short thrombosis can be treated with balloon angioplasty alone, whereas an extensive thrombosis requires a combination of mechanical devices and/or thrombolytic agents with adjunctive balloon angioplasty.",Excluded

This information about nigro-striatal and sympathetic cardiac neuronal loss may contribute to the early diagnosis of PD and provide relevant elements for differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndrome. The main limitation to investigate these different neuronal systems, is related to the need of two scans, with two tracers and double radiation exposure for patients. <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA is a dopamine precursor able to evaluate synthetic and storage capacity of dopamine in pre-synaptic terminals. This PET radiopharmaceutical is a sensitive bio-marker to assess nigro-striatal dysfunction and its diagnostic accuracy is comparable to those of <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT.

Methods Sixteen patients with de novo PD were included in this study. Patients with history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. The patients were given carbidopa (2,5 mg/Kg) orally, and after 60 min, received 185 MBq of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA. PET/CT was acquired 90 min after the injection. Cardiac <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA-PET/CT was acquired at the end of brain scan. Automatic segmentation and semiquantification of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA striatal uptake was asses using basal ganglia matching tools package. Regions of interest were drawn over the heart and mediastinum. The ratio between the uptake in the left ventricle and mediastinum (H/M ratio) was recorded for each scan. Results Both in case of putamen (r=0.75, p=0.0009) and caudate (r=0.57, p=0.02) , a significant correlation between the more affected site of striatal uptake and H/M ratio was found. Direct correlation between striatal uptake and H/M ratio was confirmed also in the controlateral site (putamen: r=0.63, p= 0.0096; caudate: r=0.54, p=0.03). No significant inverse correlation was found between UPDRS III and H/M ratio (r=- 0.3630, p= 0.16). Conclusion These findings support the hypothesis that cardiac 18FDOPA uptake may be used as a biomarker of cardiac neuronal loss. If they were confirmed, it will be feasible to image striatal and cardiac pre-synaptic monoaminergic function with a single radiopharmaceutical, dual acquisition, and PET/CT resolution, thus sparing radiation exposure and costs.",Excluded

This study aimed to develop and validate a new BREAST-Q module to address the unique concerns of patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Method(s): Phase 1 involved qualitative and cognitive interviews with women who had BCT and clinical expert input to establish content for the BCT module. A field-test (phase 2) was performed, and Rasch measurement theory (RMT) analysis was used for item reduction and examination of reliability and validity. Validation of the item-reduced scales in a clinical sample (phase 3) was conducted for further assessment of their psychometric properties. Result(s): Qualitative interviews with 24 women resulted in the addition of 15 new items across multiple existing BREAST-Q scales and the development of two new scales (Adverse Effects of Radiation and Satisfaction With Information-Radiation Therapy). Feedback from 15 patients and 5 clinical experts were used to refine the instructions, response options, and item wording. An RMT analysis of data from 3497 women resulted in item reduction. The final set of scales showed evidence of ordered response option thresholds, good item fit, and good reliability, except for the Adverse Effects of the Radiation Scale. Validity and reliability were further supported by the phase 3 data from 3125 women.

Sustained exposure to static magnetic fields at 100 mT for up to 9 DIV significantly decreased expression of MAP-2 and NeuN in cultured rat hippocampal neurons without markedly affecting GAP-43 expression. Although a significant increase was seen in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampal neuronal preparations cultured for 6-9 DIV under sustained magnetism, GFAP and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression were not affected markedly in cultured astrocytes prepared from rat hippocampus and neocortex, irrespective of cellular maturity. No significant alteration was seen in cell survivability of hippocampal neurons or astrocytes cultured under sustained magnetism. In hippocampal neurons cultured for 3 DIV under sustained magnetism, marked mRNA expression was seen for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits, NR1, NR2A-2C, NR2D, and NR3A. In addition, significant potentiation of the ability of NMDA to increase intracellular free Ca(2+) ions was observed. Differential display analysis revealed a significant decrease in mRNA expression for the transcription factor ALF1 in response to sustained magnetism for 3 DIV.

ILC3-autonomous ablation of the circadian regulator Arntl led to disrupted gut ILC3 homeostasis, impaired epithelial reactivity, a deregulated microbiome, increased susceptibility to bowel infection and disrupted lipid metabolism. Loss of ILC3-intrinsic Arntl shaped the gut 'postcode receptors' of ILC3s. Strikingly, light-dark cycles, feeding rhythms and microbial cues differentially regulated ILC3 clocks, with light signals being the major entraining cues of ILC3s. Accordingly, surgically or genetically induced deregulation of brain rhythmicity led to disrupted circadian ILC3 oscillations, a deregulated microbiome and altered lipid metabolism. Our work reveals a circadian circuitry that translates environmental light cues into enteric ILC3s, shaping intestinal health, metabolism and organismal homeostasis.",Excluded
1876,"Suppressive effects of low-power laser irradiation on bradykinin evoked action potentials in cultured murine dorsal root ganglion cells The effects of Ga-Al-As diode laser (830 nm, 16.2 mW) irradiation on the distal portion of the processes of cultured murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons associated with C-fibers were studied by patch-clamp whole-cell recording of membrane potentials at the cell body. The chemical as well as laser light stimulations were limited to the processes of the neuron isolated from the cell body with a separator. The action potentials elicited by bradykinin (BK) in the cell body were reversibly suppressed by the irradiation of laser light. The laser irradiation may block the conduction of nociceptive signals in primary afferent neurons. The present experimental method offers a simple and easy to use procedure for studying the pain relief effects by laser irradiation.",Excluded
2280,"The effect of increasing concentrations of intracranial albumin on fluid flow rates within adjacent white matter tracts in rats BACKGROUND: In most systemic cancers, tumor cells are passively carried by extracellular fluid flow to regional lymph nodes. However, the mechanism of glioma cell dissemination remains controversial, as the brain does not contain a lymphatic system. Because malignant brain tumors are characterized by a disrupted blood-brain-barrier that leaks albumin from blood vessels into brain parenchyma, we hypothesize that this albumin influx will pull water in osmotically and increase flow rates and glioma cell dissemination down adjacent white matter tracts. This may have implications for future radiation planning and steroid/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor dosing. METHOD(S): Our study examines flow rates in white matter tracts after intracranial administration of albumin. We mixed 0.12-6 mg bovine albumin with 20 muL of 2% Evans Blue and injected the mixture stereotactically into the right frontal lobes of 15 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley female rats at the gray-white matter junction over 80 minutes. Seven hours later, the rats were killed and their brains sectioned into 0.5 mm coronal slices and imaged to determine interstitial flow rates. RESULT(S): All animals tolerated the infusion without difficulty. The entire brain was white except at the site of injection and in ipsilateral white matter tracts, especially the external capsule. Average flow rates (mm/hour) for rats receiving 0.12 mg of albumin were 0.43 (coronal) and 0.13 (axial) and for those receiving 6 mg albumin were 0.99 (coronal) and 0.23 (axial). Positive correlation was observed between albumin dose administered and interstitial fluid flow rates (R = 0.57 coronal and 0.36 axial). CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates higher interstitial fluid flow rates in adjacent white matter tracts in response to albumininduced- edema. These observations provide insight into expected pathways for glioma dissemination that could be used to tailor radiation plans for individual patients. Furthermore, these findings provide a rationale for interventions to reduce glioma dissemination by limiting the extravasation of albumin through the blood-brain-barrier while local radiation is being administered.",Excluded

1855,"Enhanced excitability induced by ionizing radiation in the kindled rat Evidence derived from both clinical and experimental investigations has suggested an influence of ionizing radiation on focal epileptogenicity. To better characterize this influence we applied focal ionizing radiation to a kindled epileptic focus in the rat amygdala. The right and left basolateral amygdala and right frontal cortex were implanted with concentric bipolar electrodes. Rats were kindled through a minimum of 10 stage 5 seizures by afterdischarge-threshold electrostimulation of the left amygdala, after which generalized seizure thresholds were determined prior to irradiation. The left amygdala was exposed to single-fraction central-axis doses of either 18 or 25 Gy using a beam-collimated (60)Co source (1.25 MeV). Generalized seizure thresholds were then redetermined at weekly intervals for 10 weeks and at monthly intervals for an additional 3 months. We observed no significant changes in seizure threshold during the postirradiation interval; however, we did observe persistent changes in seizure dynamics manifesting within the first week postirradiation. These consisted of an increased tendency for seizure activity to propagate into brain stem circuits during the primary ictus (i.e., ""running fits"") and an increased tendency for secondary convulsions to emerge postictally. These effects involving seizure dynamics have not been reported previously and appear to represent a radiation-induced disinhibition of one or more neural circuits. The disparity between these effects and earlier reports of seizure-suppressive effects resulting from analogous radiation exposures is discussed in relation to kindling and status epilepticus-induced pathogenesis within the hippocampus.",Included
1497,"Use of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay to measure radiation-induced chromosome damage in lymphoblastoid cell lines To establish the optimal experimental conditions for the use of the micronuclei (MN) test to determine the level of chromosomal damage induced by ionising radiation (IR) exposure in lymphoblastoid cell lines, a time-course study was performed comparing a normal and an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cell line, the latter being characterised by an extreme radiation sensitivity. Several parameters were analysed: the use of cytochalasin-B (Cyt-B) to quantify MN, the optimum fixation time to measure radiation-induced MN, the most appropriate treatment dose of IR to distinguish between the normal and the radiosensitive cells and the cell-cycle distribution after irradiation. The results obtained showed that the spontaneous as well as the radiation-induced levels of MN were significantly higher in the AT cell compared to the normal cells (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). In both cell types the number of radiation-induced MN were lower in the cultures without Cyt-B than those with Cyt-B (P < 0.001), with the AT cells being distinguished in terms of IR-induced MN from the normal cells only with the addition of Cyt-B. The level of MN formation was independent of the dose of Cyt-B used (3 or 6 microg/ml). The optimum time for radiation-induced MN measured was found to be between 48 and 72 h post-irradiation, with 2 and 4 Gy exposures inducing similar levels of MN. However, as the higher dose caused a greater delay in the cell-cycle, treatment with 2 Gy with MN measurement at 48 h in the presence of 3 microg/ml Cyt-B were chosen as the optimum experimental conditions. This choice was validated using two additional normal and AT cell lines. In conclusion, our results show that the use of Cyt-B increases the sensitivity of the MN test for comparing differences in radiosensitivity between lymphoblastoid cell lines.",Excluded
1712,"Morphological changes in ICP pulse waveform as potential markers for early determination of external ventricular drain clamping trial outcome Introduction External ventricular drains (EVD) are used to manage intracranial pressure (ICP) in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) patients. After days of use a decision is made to remove the drain or place a shunt, involving EVD clamping and CT imaging to observe ventricular size and clinical status. This practice leads to prolonged hospital stay and radiation exposure. This study applies a validated morphological clustering analysis of KCP pulse (MOCAIP) algorithm to differentiate an intact CSF system from an abnormal one during EVD clamping. We hypothesize that pulses with similar mean ICP should have similar shapes in an intact CSF system. Methods This is a retrospective study with 43 aSAH patients with reported clamping trial, admitted to our institution between 03/2013 and 08/2014. By reviewing clinical notes and pre/post brain imaging results, 25 patients were determined with an intact cSf system (A) and 18 with an impaired one (B). MOCAIP algorithm was applied to ICP signals to form series of artifact-free dominant pulses. Finally, pulses with similar mean ICP were identified and Euclidean and geodesic inter-pulse distances calculated in a 4-hour moving window. Results ANOVA analyses showed significant difference on the standard deviations of Euclidean (p< 0.001) and geodesic distance (p=0.001), between groups A and B. Mann-Whitney U tests were used on the mean distances, showing significant difference on the Euclidean (p=0.007) and geodesic distance (p=0.02) between the two groups. The area under the ROC curve was 0.79 and 0.78 for the standard deviations and 0.74 and 0.71 for the mean Euclidean and geodesic distance respectively. Conclusions Patients with an impaired CSF system showed a larger mean and variability of inter-pulse distances, indicating frequent changes on the morphology of pulses.. This technique may provide a method to rapidly determine if patients will need placement of a shunt or can simply have the EVD removed.",Excluded
2298,"Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain caused by acute radiation injuries Moderate to severe acute pain is a common consequence of fullcourse radiotherapy. Improved analgesics are needed, but therapeutic development requires an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie acute radiation-associated pain (RAP). Our preliminary data suggest that transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels on sensory neurons play important roles in RAP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of various Trp channels in acute RAP using a mouse model of oral radiation-induced mucositis. Mice underwent high dose single fraction lingual irradiation or sham irradiation. This resulted in glossitis that was most severe at 10-12 days postirradiation and resolved within 20 days. Micewere euthanized on days 1, 5, 11, 21, and 45 post-irradiation. Functional analysis of trigeminal ganglia neurons was assessed via calcium imaging; this revealed significantly increased proportions of neurons that were sensitive to capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist), histamine (TRPV4 partial agonist), or TNF-alpha (a general inflammatory marker). These changes were seen as early as 1-day post-irradiation and lasted until the 21st day. Via quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy, we documented Trpv1 overexpression in the trigeminal ganglia neurons of tongueirradiated mice on days 11 and 21. Together, these results indicate that both TRPV1 and TRPV4 are activated and upregulated, and contribute to the acute response of oral tissues to therapeutic irradiation. Thus, future studies should focus on assessing these two Trp channels as potential targets for RAP mitigation in human and animal cancer patients.",Included

The frequency of SCEs is dramatically increased by chemical mutagens and may reflect the level of DNA damage. Lymphocytes from patients with ataxia telangiectasis (AT) show high levels of spontaneous chromosome damage and are hypersentive to ionising radiations and it was of interest to examine the levels of SCE induced in these cells by various mutagens. The frequencies of SCE after treatment with X=rays or three chemical mutagens were equivalent to those in normal cells. The effects of fluorodeoxyuridine and deoxycytidine on SCE frequencies were also tested.,Excluded
2354,"The distribution of thirteen GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain. III. Embryonic and postnatal development The embryonic and postnatal expression of 13 GABAA receptor subunit genes in the rat CNS was studied by in situ hybridization. Each transcript exhibited a unique regional and temporal developmental expression profile. For example, in both embryonic and early postnatal cortex and thalamus, expression of the alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and beta 3 mRNAs was pronounced. In particular, the alpha 5 gene expression underwent a prominent peak in early brain. Subsequently, the thalamocortical expression of these four genes substantially diminished and was superseded in the adult by the alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, and delta subunit mRNAs. Similarly, gamma 1 and gamma 3 gene expression also dropped markedly during development, their initial stronger expression being restricted to relatively few structures. In contrast, gamma 2 gene expression was widespread and mostly remained constant with increasing age. The medial septum and globus pallidus were regions expressing few subunits in both early postnatal and adult stages, allowing clear developmental combinatorial changes to be inferred (alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 1 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 1/gamma 2, respectively). In contrast, cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibited no developmental switch, expressing only the alpha 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs from birth to adult. Certain GABAA transcripts were also detected in germinal zones (e.g., beta 1, beta 3, gamma 1) and in embryonic peripheral tissues such as dorsal root ganglia (e.g., alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 3, gamma 2) and intestine (gamma 3). Some parallels in regional and temporal CNS expression were noted (e.g., alpha 1 beta 2, alpha 2 beta 3, alpha 4/alpha 6 delta), whereas the alpha 5 and beta 1 regional mRNA expressions converted over time. The changes of GABAA receptor subunit gene expression suggest a molecular explanation for earlier observations on changing ligand binding affinities. Thus, the composition, and presumably properties, of embryonic/early postnatal rat GABAA receptors differs markedly from those expressed in the adult brain.",Excluded
1640,"Effectiveness of a 1-day aspiration plus Gamma Knife surgery procedure for metastatic brain tumor with a cystic component OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has gained increasing relevance in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors, but many metastatic tumors contain a large cystic component and often exceed the size limit for GKS. For such lesions, the authors adopted a procedure in which stereotactic aspiration is first performed and followed immediately by GKS on the same day. In this paper, the authors describe this 1-day combined procedure and evaluate its efficacy.METHODS: Between 2005 and 2010, 25 cystic metastases in 25 patients were treated at Dokkyo Medical University. The patients first underwent MRI and stereotactic aspiration of the cyst while stationary in a Leksell stereotactic frame; immediately afterward, the patients underwent a second MR imaging session and Gamma Knife treatment. Tumor volume reduction, tumor control rate, and overall survival were examined.RESULTS: Tumor volume, including the cystic component, decreased from 8.0-64.2 cm(3) (mean 20.3 cm(3)) to 3.0-36.2 cm(3) (mean 10.3 cm(3)) following aspiration, and the volume of 24 of 25 lesions decreased to less than 16.6 cm(3), which is equivalent to the volume of a 3.16-cm sphere. At least 20 Gy was delivered to the entire lesion in 24 of 25 cases. Good tumor control was obtained in 16 of 21 cases that could be evaluated during a median follow-up period of 11 months (range 1-27 months); however, reaccumulation of cyst contents was observed in 2 patients who required Ommaya reservoir placement.CONCLUSIONS: The 1-day aspiration plus GKS procedure is an effective and time-efficient treatment for large cystic brain metastases.",Excluded

This prospective study examined the association between symptoms experienced by the patient, clinical findings observed by the physician and reactions visible in chest X-ray as interpreted by a radiologist, as well as the association between skin or breast symptoms and lung symptoms induced by radiotherapy after different methods of surgery.METHODS: Altogether 207 consecutive breast cancer patients entered the trial between 1st October 1997 and 31st December 1998. Chest X-rays were taken at entry and 3, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. The frequency and intensity of symptoms as well as clinical and chest X-ray findings were assessed over time.RESULTS: Skin and breast symptoms were common after radiotherapy but seldom severe (9%). Lung reactions were seen in chest X-ray in 47% of patients in re-evaluation by a radiologist at 3 months. The frequency of lung or skin symptoms did not correlate with chest X-ray findings, but there was a significant correlation between skin and lung symptoms. Radiotherapy after conservative surgery for node-positive breast cancer caused lung reactions seen in chest X-ray more often than after mastectomy when using other techniques. The reactions were most common at the 6 month evaluation (P=0.01). Concomitant adjuvant chemo- or endocrine therapy did not significantly increase the incidence of lung reactions.CONCLUSIONS: Skin, breast and lung symptoms were frequent after radiotherapy, but there was no real association between lung or skin symptoms and chest X-ray findings. The only correlation noted was between skin or breast symptoms and lung symptoms experienced by patients. Radiotherapy after conservative surgery was more frequently linked to chest X-ray findings than radiotherapy after mastectomy. We conclude that routine chest X-ray after radiotherapy gives no more clinically relevant information than the symptoms of the patient and we do not recommend routine chest X-rays for that reason.",Excluded

No attempt was made to spare the hippocampus. NCF testing was conducted at baseline and 18 months follow-up, on a prospective clinical trial. Regression-based standardized z scores were calculated by using similar healthy control individuals evaluated at the same test-retest interval. NCF impairment was defined as a z score <=-1.5. After delineation of the bilateral hippocampi according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group contouring atlas, dose-volume histograms were generated for the left and right hippocampi and for the composite pair. Biologically equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractions (EQD(2)) assuming an alpha/beta ratio of 2 Gy were computed. Fisher's exact test and binary logistic regression were used for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. Dose-response data were fit to a nonlinear model.RESULTS: Of 29 patients enrolled in this trial, 18 completed both baseline and 18-month NCF testing. An EQD(2) to 40% of the bilateral hippocampi >7.3 Gy was associated with impairment in Wechsler Memory Scale-III Word List (WMS-WL) delayed recall (odds ratio [OR] 19.3; p = 0.043). The association between WMS-WL delayed recall and EQD(2) to 100% of the bilateral hippocampi >0.0 Gy trended to significance (OR 14.8; p = 0.068).CONCLUSION: EQD(2) to 40% of the bilateral hippocampi greater than 7.3 Gy is associated with long-term impairment in list-learning delayed recall after FSRT for benign or low-grade adult brain tumors. Given that modern intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques can reduce the dose to the bilateral hippocampi below this dosimetric threshold, patients should be enrolled in ongoing prospective trials of hippocampal sparing during cranial irradiation to confirm these preliminary results.",Excluded

In this study, a purified, recombinant chlorotoxin-like peptide from the scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch (named rBmK CTa) was characterized by in vivo and in vitro studies. The results from cell proliferation assay with human glioma (SHG-44) cells showed that rBmK CTa inhibits the growth of glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of approximately 0.28microM. Under the same conditions, the IC(50) value for normal astrocytes increased to 8microM. This clearly indicated that rBmK CTa had specific toxicity against glioma cells but not astrocytes. Results from whole-cell patch-clamp recording showed that chloride current in SHG-44 was inhibited by rBmK CTa in a voltage-dependent manner and percent inhibitions for the blocking action of rBmK CTa (0.07 and 0.14microM) on I(Cl) was 17.64+/-3.06% and 55.86+/-2.83%, respectively.

1413,"CT and MR imaging in Hodgkin's disease - Present and future Initial staging of Hodgkin's disease is crucial to determine the location and extent of disease, and is the hallmark for the choice of treatment. At present, the established radiological technique for staging Hodgkin's disease is computed tomography (CT). Modern multidetector row CT scanners allow fast imaging from the scull base to the groins during a single breath hold with a spatial resolution of approximately 1 mm. Both, nodal and extranodal involvement of Hodgkin's disease can be diagnosed with CT. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is another useful cross-sectional imaging modality for staging Hodgkin's disease. The development of fast MR imaging techniques has considerably reduced imaging time without compromising the quality of MR images. As a consequence, MR imaging is now considered to be as diagnostic as CT for staging Hodgkin's disease. The excellent soft-tissue contrast and the lack of exposure to ionizing radiation are the main advantages of MR imaging. For the detection of extranodal Hodgkin's disease, MR imaging is superior to assess involvement of the brain, the spinal cord and bone marrow; while CT allows excellent evaluation of lung disease. Common major problems in staging Hodgkin's disease are still the detection of nodal involvement in normal sized lymph nodes and residual tumor masses after therapy. In the future, newly developed lymphotropic contrast agents for MR imaging might be helpful to answer these questions. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.",Excluded

1837,"Interlayer Repulsion of Retinal Ganglion Cell Mosaics Regulates Spatial Organization of Functional Maps in the Visual Cortex In higher mammals, orientation tuning of neurons is organized into a quasi-periodic pattern in the primary visual cortex. Our previous model studies suggested that the topography of cortical orientation maps may originate from moire interference of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics, but did not account for how the consistent spatial period of maps could be achieved. Here we address this issue with two crucial findings on the development of RGC mosaics: first, homotypic local repulsion between RGCs can develop a long-range hexagonal periodicity. Second, heterotypic interaction restrains the alignment of ON and OFF mosaics, and generates a periodic interference pattern map with consistent spatial frequency. To validate our model, we quantitatively analyzed the RGC mosaics in cat data, and confirmed that the observed retinal mosaics showed evidence of heterotypic interactions, contrary to the previous view that ON and OFF mosaics are developed independently. <b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Orientation map is one of the most studied functional maps in the brain, but it has remained unanswered how the consistent spatial periodicity of maps could be developed. In the current study, we address this issue with our developmental model for the retinal origin of orientation map. We showed that local repulsive interactions between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can develop a hexagonal periodicity in the RGC mosaics and restrict the alignment between ON and OFF mosaics, so that they generate a periodic pattern with consistent spatial frequency for both the RGC mosaics and the cortical orientation maps. Our results demonstrate that the organization of functional maps in visual cortex, including its structural consistency, may be constrained by a retinal blueprint.",Excluded

We investigated the potential of targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) to improve the therapeutic outcome of combined radiotherapy and TMZ in glioblastoma. METHODS ANDMATERIALS: We evaluated the preclinical potential of a STAT3 inhibitor, Cpd188 combined with temozolomide and radiation by in vitro clonogenic assays using two established glioblastoma cell lines (U251, U87) and two patients-derived glioblastoma cell lines (GBL12, GBL28) and in vivo studies using nude mice bearing intracranial U251 xenografts. RESULT(S): Cpd188 potentiated the radiosensitizing effect ofTMZ in U251 glioblastoma cell line which has high levels of p-STAT3 expression and in vitro. Increased radiosensitizing effects ofTMZwere associated with the induction of apoptosis and the reversion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cpd188 delayed in vivo tumor growth both alone and in combination with fractionated radiation and TMZ with a trend toward improved survival rates. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections showed that Cpd188 decreased the expression of CD31 (a marker of endothelial proliferation), vascular endothelial growth factor, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, suggesting that Cpd188 also has anti-angiogenic effects. We also confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of Cpd188 of GBL28 cell line which was originated from a patient who had a glioblastoma and also was confirmed high level of STAT3 expression and unmethylated MGMT. CONCLUSION(S): These data indicate that Cpd188 has the potential to improve the therapeutic outcome of combined radiotherapy and TMZ in human glioblastoma, especially in patients whose tumor has a high level of STAT3 expression regardless of MGMT methylation status.",Excluded
1708,"Focused Ultrasound-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Opening Enhances GSK-3 Inhibitor Delivery for Amyloid-Beta Plaque Reduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is the leading cause of age-related dementia. Currently, therapeutic agent delivery to the CNS is a valued approach for AD therapy. Unfortunately, the CNS penetration is greatly hampered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Focused-ultrasound (FUS) has been demonstrated to temporally open the BBB, thus promoting therapeutic agent delivery to the CNS. Recently, the BBB opening procedure was further reported to clear the deposited Abeta plaque due to microglia activation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the use of FUS-induced BBB opening to enhance GSK-3 inhibitor delivery, which would bring additive effect of Abeta plaque clearance by FUS with the reduction of Abeta plaque synthesis by GSK-3 inhibitor in an AD mice model. FUS-induced BBB opening on APPswe/PSEN1-dE9 transgenic mice was performed unilaterally, with the contralateral hemisphere serving as a reference. GSK-3 level was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and autoradiography (ARG) was also conducted to quantitatively confirm the Abeta plaque reduction. Results from IHC showed GSK-3 inhibitor effectively reduced GSK-3 activity up to 61.3% with the addition of FUS-BBB opening and confirming the proposed therapeutic route.

In the present cases, we observed a recurrence of radiation necrosis after temporary improvement by bevacizumab treatment. Re-treatment with bevacizumab controlled the necrosis again. A 39-year-old male and a 57-year-old female were diagnosed with glioblastoma and lung cancer metastasis, respectively. The former patient underwent partial resection of the glioblastoma, followed by boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and 30 Gy of fractionated X-ray radiotherapy. Eleven months after BNCT, he suffered from left hemiparesis and convulsions with enlargement of a perifocal edema. The latter patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery twice for the same tumor. Three months after the second radiosurgery, she had an uncontrollable convulsion and right hemiplegia with a massive perifocal edema. Both lesions were suggested to be radiation necroses by positron emission tomography using amino acids as a tracer. Neither patient responded to corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or vitamin E. They underwent treatment with 5 mg/kg bevacizumab biweekly, for a total of 6 cycles. The size of the perifocal edema was clearly reduced in response to the treatments. The neurological status of the patients improved concomitant with therapy. However, the clinical status of both patients was aggravated several months after the bevacizumab was stopped, and the perifocal edemas enlarged again. The patients underwent a second treatment with bevacizumab, and the perifocal edemas again decreased.

Three glioma, rat C6, and human T98G and U87 cell lines were treated with the NO generating agents, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP). These agents released NO in the cell culture media and inhibited the growth of the glioma cells. Growth-inhibition was attenuated by hemoglobin, a known inhibitor of NO, suggesting it is mediated by NO. When C6 and T98G cells were irradiated in the presence of SNAP or SNP at 100 microM, radiosensitization was observed. SNAP at 100 microM exhibited a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.4 for C6 cells and 1.8 for T98G cells. SNP at 100 microM only radiosensitized T98G cells with a SER of 1.9. The effect of SNP on radiosensitization of C6 cells was unclear. We conclude that NO generating agents are potential growth inhibitors and radiosensitizers for malignant glioma cells. NO mediated radiosensitization of glioma cells by NO generating agents may offer a new therapeutic approach for malignant glioma.",Excluded

2378,"Treatment of cerebral radionecrosis by hyperbaric oxygen therapy Clinically observed adverse radiation effects (ARE) are rather uncommon, but modern imaging reveals that they are more common after radiosurgery than previously believed. Little is known about the pathogenesis, and current treatment is mostly empirical. The benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) on radiation-induced bone and soft tissue necrosis is known in lesions in the maxillofacial area, the mouth and in the head and neck. HBO raises the tissue pO2 and initiates a cellular and vascular repair mechanism. This forms the basis for the hypothesis that it might also help alleviate the results of cerebral radionecrosis. This study is a preliminary attempt to test this hypothesis. Two patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were chosen for the study. They had been treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and had developed imaging signs consistent with ARE. They were treated by breathing 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (250 kPa) in sessions of 60 minutes per day. This treatment was repeated 40 times in cycles of ten sessions. Both responded well to HBO, one lesion disappeared and the other was reduced significantly in size. No adjuvant steroids were given. These results give evidence that HBO has a potential value in treating ARE but further experience will be needed to confirm its definite benefit.",Excluded
1574,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for nonvestibular schwannomas This article summarizes tumor control and functional outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with nonvestibular schwannomas, in comparison with those treated with microsurgical resection. To date, surgical resection has been a common treatment for nonvestibular schwannomas. Because these tumors are generally benign, complete tumor resection is a desirable curative treatment. However, it is almost infeasible to completely remove these tumors without any complications, even for experienced neurosurgeons, because of adherence to surrounding critical structures such as cranial nerves, brainstem, or vessels. SRS provides a good tumor control rate with much less morbidity than microsurgical resection.",Excluded
1503,"Complete homonymous hemianopia due to cerebral infarction of the lateral geniculate body: A case report with diffusion tensor image findings Background: The human lateral geniculate body (LGB) is the thalamic visual center linking the retina to the striate cortex. The human LGB has dual blood supplies from the anterior choroidal artery of the internal carotid artery and the lateral posterior choroidal artery of the posterior cerebral artery. Thus, complete homonemous hemianopia caused by cerebral infarction of the LGB is extremely rare. Case Report: A 63-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus presented due to a sudden visual field defect. He had no other vascular risk factors or focal neurological deficits. Five days later, complete right homonymous hemianopia was detected by Humphrey automated perimetry. Brain MRI and DWI revealed an infarction at the left LGB. MRA revealed no obstruction or stenosis. Diffusion tensor image (DTI) showed decreased fractional anisotrophy value in the left occipital subcortical area (right, 0.436; left, 0.384). The density of optic radiation decreased more on the right side in tractography than on the left side. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Quadruple sectoranopia can be caused by lesions in the medial and lateral portions of the LGB which are supplied by the anterior choroidal artery. The lateral posterior choroidal artery supplies the central part of the LGB. Thus, occlusion of this artery produces a wedge-shaped homonymous hemianopsia or horizontal sectoranopia. However, despite the LGB lesion, our patient showed a complete homonemous hemianopia probably due to involvement of the whole LGB through occlusion of a variant vessel that supplied the whole LGB rather than simultaneous occlusion of 2 vessels. The patient's DTI findings were well consistent with his clinical features.",Excluded
1401,"Autophosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A Ionizing radiation induces autophosphorylation of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase on serine 1981; however, the precise mechanisms that regulate ATM activation are not fully understood. Here, we show that the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) induces autophosphorylation of ATM on serine 1981 in unirradiated cells at concentrations that inhibit protein phosphatase 2A-like activity in vitro. OA did not induce gamma-H2AX foci, suggesting that it induces ATM autophosphorylation by inactivation of a protein phosphatase rather than by inducing DNA double-strand breaks. In support of this, we show that ATM interacts with the scaffolding (A) subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), that the scaffolding and catalytic (C) subunits of PP2A interact with ATM in undamaged cells and that immunoprecipitates of ATM from undamaged cells contain PP2A-like protein phosphatase activity. Moreover, we show that IR induces phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of PP2A from ATM and loss of the associated protein phosphatase activity. We propose that PP2A plays an important role in the regulation of ATM autophosphorylation and activity in vivo.",Excluded

We propose that one or several of the humoral factors necessary for the growth of pituitary adenomas is missing in these experimental environments. The purpose of our experiments was to examine the possible influence of the hypothalamus in supporting cellular proliferation, and thus adenoma growth. Fragments from four human pituitary adenomas (three pituitary prolactinomas; one ACTH-secreting adenoma) were transplanted into the pituitary fossa of total-body irradiated, hypophysectomized rats. The rats were killed after two weeks and perfused with a mixture of formalin and India ink. Histologic examination of serial sagittal sections through the pituitary fossa and the adjacent brain showed: vascularization of the grafts from the pituitary stalk and from the scar tissue in the sphenoid bone; survival of some adenomas; and numerous mitoses in an ACTH-secreting specimen obtained from a patient who had Cushing's disease. We conclude from these experiments that as yet unidentified hypothalamus factors are essential for the growth of certain types of pituitary adenomas.",Excluded
1268,"Melatonin: A Potential Anti-Oxidant Therapeutic Agent for Mitochondrial Dysfunctions and Related Disorders Mitochondria play a central role in cellular physiology. Besides their classic function of energy metabolism, mitochondria are involved in multiple cell functions, including energy distribution through the cell, energy/heat modulation, regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium homeostasis, and control of apoptosis. Simultaneously, mitochondria are the main producer and target of ROS with the result that multiple mitochondrial diseases are related to ROS-induced mitochondrial injuries. Increased free radical generation, enhanced mitochondrial inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production, decreased respiratory complex activity, impaired electron transport system, and opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores have all been suggested as factors responsible for impaired mitochondrial function. Because of these, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and aging, are caused by ROS-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions. Melatonin, the major hormone of the pineal gland, also acts as an anti-oxidant and as a regulator of mitochondrial bioenergetic function. Melatonin is selectively taken up by mitochondrial membranes, a function not shared by other anti-oxidants, and thus has emerged as a major potential therapeutic tool for treating neurodegenerative disorders. Multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown the protective role of melatonin for preventing oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction seen in experimental models of PD, AD, and HD. With these functions in mind, this article reviews the protective role of melatonin with mechanistic insights against mitochondrial diseases and suggests new avenues for safe and effective treatment modalities against these devastating neurodegenerative diseases. Future insights are also discussed. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",Excluded
1988,"Study of antioxidative effects and anti-inflammatory effects in mice due to low-dose X-irradiation or radon inhalation Low-dose irradiation induces various stimulating effects, especially activation of the biological defense system including antioxidative and immune functions. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause cell damage and death and can induce many types of diseases. This paper reviews new insights into inhibition of ROS-related diseases with low-dose irradiation or radon inhalation. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before or after carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment inhibits hepatopathy in mice. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before ischemia-reperfusion injury or cold-induced brain injury also inhibits edema. These findings suggest that low-dose X-irradiation has antioxidative effects due to blocking the damage induced by free radicals or ROS. Moreover, radon inhalation increases superoxide dismutase activity in many organs and inhibits CCl4-induced hepatic and renal damage and streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes. These findings suggest that radon inhalation also has antioxidative effects. This antioxidative effect against CCl4-induced hepatopathy is comparable to treatment with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) at a dose of 500 mg/kg weight, or alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) treatment at a dose of 300 mg/kg weight, and is due to activation of antioxidative functions. In addition, radon inhalation inhibits carrageenan-induced inflammatory paw edema, suggesting that radon inhalation has anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, radon inhalation inhibits formalin-induced inflammatory pain and chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, suggesting that radon inhalation relieves pain. Thus, low-dose irradiation very likely activates the defense systems in the body, and therefore, contributes to preventing or reducing ROS-related injuries, which are thought to involve peroxidation.",Included
1306,"Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and structural chromosome aberration in mutagenicity testing Data from previous studies published on the induction by mutagens of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and structural chromosome damage were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. Although a good correlation between the incidence of both cytogenetic phenomena has been pointed out in many previous publications, about 30% of the agents for which comparable data were available yielded non-corresponding qualitative results concerning both indicator effects. However, even in groups with good qualitative agreement distinct quantitative differences indicated different molecular mechanisms of the formation of SCEs and breaks. Additional information supporting the importance of these differences for the validity of both indicator systems has been derived from the results obtained using strong clastogens exhibiting a low or no SCE-inducing activity and vice versa, from special observations on chromosomal breakage syndromes, and from studies on the action of known co- and anti-clastogens on SCE-induction by chemical mutagens. As a result, it has been suggested that the SCE-technique should be considered as a valuable additional method for cytogenetic mutagenicity testing, which, however, is not adequate to replace the classical methods of analysis of structural chromosome damage.

1465,Acute effects of X irradiation on membrane potential and membrane resistance of snail neurones. [German] Acute X irradiation of the metacerebral giant neurons of Helix pomatia above 1000 R or 3.4 kR/min (dose or dose rate threshold) leads to a significant reduction of the membrane potential. After blocking the afferent excitatory synapses the radiation depolarizations are strongly decreased but not completely suppressed. Long time irradiation at high dose rates and after the blocking of afferent synapses produced a depolarization in 2 phases: an immediate quick depolarization of about 10 mV is followed by a much slower decrease of the membrane potential. Substitution of extracellular sodium by tris ions suppresses the quick depolarization phase. The input resistance of the cell shows a transient increase at the begin of irradiation followed by a substantial decrease. These results are discussed in view of the possible mechanisms of radiation induced permeability changes in excitable membranes.,Included

1203,"Potential role for LINAC-based stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of 5 or more radioresistant melanoma brain metastases OBJECT: Linear accelerator (LINAC)-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment option for patients with melanoma in whom brain metastases have developed. Very limited data are available on treating patients with >=5 lesions. The authors sought to determine the effectiveness of SRS in patients with >=5 melanoma brain metastases.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of metastatic melanoma treated with SRS in a single treatment session for >=5 lesions was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were reviewed post-SRS to evaluate local control (LC). Disease progression on imaging was defined using the 2009 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Survival curves were calculated from the date of brain metastases diagnosis or the date of SRS by using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Univariate and multivariate analysis (UVA and MVA, respectively) were performed using the Cox proportional-hazards model.RESULTS: The authors identified 149 metastatic brain lesions treated in 28 patients. The median patient age was 60.5 years (range 38-83 years), and the majority of patients (24 [85.7%]) had extracranial metastases. Four patients (14.3%) had received previous whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and 11 (39.3%) had undergone previous SRS. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 0.34 cm3 (range 0.01-12.5 cm3). Median follow-up was 6.3 months (range 1-46 months). At the time of treatment, 7% of patients were categorized as recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class I, 89% as RPA Class II, and 4% as RPA Class III. The rate of local failure was 11.4%. Kaplan-Meier LC estimates at 6 and 12 months were 91.3% and 82.2%, respectively. A PTV volume>=0.34 cm3 was a significant predictor of local failure on UVA (HR 16.1, 95% CI 3.2-292.6, p<0.0001) and MVA (HR 14.8, 95% CI 3.0-268.5, p=0.0002). Sixteen patients (57.1%) were noted to have distant failure in the brain with a median time to failure of 3 months (range 1-15 months). Nine patients with distant failures received WBRT, and 7 received additional SRS. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.4 and 7.6 months from the date of brain metastases diagnosis and the date of SRS, respectively. The KM OS estimates at 6 and 12 months were 57.8% and 28.2%, respectively, from the time of SRS treatment. The RPA class was a significant predictor of KM OS estimates from the date of treatment (p=0.02). Patients who did not receive WBRT after SRS treatment had decreased OS on MVA (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-12.0, p=0.03), and patients who did not receive WBRT prior to SRS had improved OS (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.53, p=0.007).CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery for >=5 lesions appears to be effective for selected patients with metastatic melanoma, offering excellent LC. This is particularly important for patients as new targeted systemic agents are improving outcomes but still have limited efficacy within the central nervous system.",Excluded

2387,"Human glycine alpha1 receptor inhibition by quercetin is abolished or inversed by alpha267 mutations in transmembrane domain 2 Quercetin, one of the flavonoids, is a compound of low molecular weight found in fruits and vegetables. Besides its antioxidative effect, quercetin also shows a wide range of diverse neuropharmacological actions. However, the cellular mechanisms of quercetin's actions, especially on ligand-gated ion channels and synaptic transmissions, are not well studied. We investigated the effect of quercetin on the human glycine alpha1 receptor channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Application of quercetin reversibly inhibited glycine-induced current (I(Gly)). Quercetin's inhibition depends on its dose, with an IC(50) of 21.5+/-.2 microM. The inhibition was sensitive to membrane voltages. Site-directed mutations of S267 to S267Y but not S267A, S267F, S267G, S267K, S267L and S267T at transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) nearly abolished quercetin-induced inhibition of I(Gly). In contrast, in site-directed mutant receptors such as S267 to S267I, S267R and S267V, quercetin enhanced I(Gly) compared to the wild-type receptor. The EC(50) was 22.6+/-1.4, 25.5+/-4.2, and 14.5+/-3.1 microM for S267I, S267R and S267V, respectively.

1326,"Influence of rotational setup errors on dose in target and organs at risk in cranial radiotherapy Purpose or Objective: The aim of this study is to detect dose aberrations in cranial radiation therapy in the target volume and adjacent organs at risk (OARs) caused by insufficient rotational setup correction. 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) fusions were considered as the gold standard and compared to 4 DOF and 3 DOF registrations. Material(s) and Method(s): Setup errors of 12 patients with cranial lesions undergoing radiotherapy and positioned with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were analyzed. The PTVs of the included patients were large and irregularly shaped and located near or overlapping cranial OARs such as brainstem, chiasm, optical nerves or lenses. A registration between planning CT and the first CBCT of the treatment course was performed using 6 DOF, 4 DOF and 3 DOF. Differences between the three registrations were implemented and the planning CT and associated structure set shifted and warped accordingly. To detect the DOF with the largest influence on the delivered dose a rotational error of 2degree, 3degree and 4degree was simulated in one rotational dimension at a time. Using the original parameters, the treatment plan was copied and recalculated to the warped image set. Dmax and Dmean of the cranial OARs and D98 and D2 for the respective CTV and PTV were analyzed. Result(s): Differences between 6 DOF and 4 or 3 DOF fusion ranged between -1.4degree and 2degree in pitch direction, -2.5degree to 2degree in yaw, and -4.4degree to 4.2degree in roll direction. Resulting median D98 in the PTV decreased by 0.7 Gy using only 3 DOF and increased by 0.08 Gy if 4 DOF were included. Maximum dose reduction of the PTV D98 was 2.96 Gy using 3 DOF and 0.39 Gy using 4 DOF. CTV dose decreased by 0.68 using only 3 DOF and by 0.03 Gy using 4 DOF. Resulting median dose effects in the OARs are displayed in Figure 1, with largest effects of additional 0.2 and 0.8 Gy for the left and right lenses, respectively. Doses for individual patients varied up to additional 6 Gy in the lenses and 3 Gy in the optic nerves. Effects on doses in the OARs and target volumes were generally larger with 3 DOF than with 4 DOF included, except for the brainstem with no visible difference. Pitch and roll setup errors had larger effects on the OARs compared to yaw setup deviations, as demonstrated in Figure 2. 2degree roll setup errors caused more than 5 Gy dose effect on the ipsilateral optical nerve and chiasm, followed by 2degree pitch errors resulting in over 3 Gy additional dose. The simulated 2degree yaw error had an effect of under 1 Gy on dose delivery. [Figure Presented] [Figure Presented] Conclusion(s): For cases involving higher dose effects on the evaluated structures, 4DOF registration improved plan conformity compared to 3DOF. Clinically relevant dose deviations in the CTV were not found in this patient collective. While mean dose delivery to OARs increased only slightly, up to 6 Gy in additional dose occurred for individual patient cases in this collective because of rotational errors. Safety margins for OARs could be a solution to this matter. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded

2040,"Crosstalk of ERBB2 with lef1 regulates jagged1-mediated radioresistance in glioblastoma ErbB2 (Her2) belongs to the family of EGF receptor tyrosine kinases and plays a vital oncogenic role in several cancers. Gliomas are reported to have aberrant overexpression of ErbB2, but its role in glioma biology and treatment resistance have not been well studied. We have previously reported that ionizing radiation (IR) increases cell invasiveness and radioresistance. In our preliminary studies, we observed that shRNA mediated ErbB2 silencing in glioma cell lines resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation and invasion which was associated with a suppression of Notch signaling. To examine its role in radioresistance, we treated glioma cells with IR and observed that the cells exhibited a significant increase in invasiveness associated with nuclear translocation of ErbB2 and transcriptional upregulation of the Notch receptor ligand, Jagged-1. To further investigate the relationship between ErbB2 translocation and Notch signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation and transcription factor binding array studies in IR-treated cells which revealed an interesting association of nuclear ErbB2 with the TCF1/ LEF1 complex that is known to transcriptionally regulate Jagged-1 expression. In addition, chromatin-binding assays showed recruitment of ErbB2 to putative LEF1 consensus sites of the Jagged-1 promoter, suggesting a potential role for ErbB2 in the transcriptional regulation of Jagged-1 and consequently of Notch signaling after radiation in glioma cells. Further, downregulation of ErbB2 inhibited Notch signaling and decreased IR-induced invasion in these cells. These in vitro findings were further validated in an orthotopic intracranial glioma model that showed significant growth inhibition of intracranial ErbB2. shRNA-tumors compared to controls.

2154,"Thoracic radiation-YES Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15%-20% of all lung cancers, and the overwhelming majority (>95%) are associated with tobacco exposure. The incidence of all types of lung cancer, including SCLC, has been declining in the United States with the onset of tobacco smoking cessation programs, although this trend took nearly 20 years to become evident among men. Overall survival (OS) rates for patients with lung cancer have also increased by about 5% since the advent of low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning to detect early lung cancer. The prognosis for patients with SCLC continues to be poor but has improved with the advent of smoking cessation campaigns, more effective chemotherapy agents and radiation planning and delivery techniques, and the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for those who experience a complete response to therapy. Consolidation with chest radiotherapy has improved OS among patients with extensive-stage SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. SCLC often presents as bulky symptomatic masses, and mediastinal involvement is common with or without pleural effusion and extrathoracic disease. Extrathoracic spread (i.e., extensive-stage disease) is also quite common, being present in 80%-85% of cases at diagnosis. Brain metastases are present in approximately 20% of patients at diagnosis; roughly half of these metastases are symptomatic and the other half are detected by imaging. Predictors of poor prognosis include poor performance status, older age, and being male. The pathologic subtypes of the disease (small cell carcinoma and combined small cell carcinoma) all carry a similarly poor prognosis. Current guidelines of the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend the use of positron emission tomography (PET), CT scanning, or fused PET/CT scanning of the chest, liver, adrenals, bone, and other areas of concern in the diagnosis and staging of SCLC (NCCN guideline-SCLC 2017). Thoracic radiotherapy has also become important for improving OS among patients with SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. In one prospectively randomized study of 498 patients with extensive-stage SCLC (WHO performance status score 0-2) who achieved complete response to chemotherapy, patients who received consolidation thoracic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) had significantly better 2-year OS rates than did those who did not receive thoracic radiotherapy (13% vs. 3%, P=0.004). Thoracic radiotherapy further improved thoracic-only failure rates (19.8% vs. 46% without, P=0.001) (Slotman B et al, Lancet Oncol 2015;385:36- 42). However, many patients with extensive-stage SCLC do not respond to the standard etoposide/cisplatin chemotherapy (Fig 1). Those patients may need to receive molecular-targeted therapies or immunotherapy with the consolidating thoracic radiotherapy. Several histologic and immunohistochemical markers have been evaluated for diagnosing or monitoring treatment response in SCLC, including transcription thyroid factor-1 (positive in >85% of SCLC cases); cytokeratin 7; deletions in chromosome 3; Leu-7; chromogranin A; synaptophysin; myc amplification; and p53 mutations (present in ~75% of cases). Deletions in tumor-suppressor genes are also relatively common and include fragile histidine triad (FHIT) (80%); RAS effector homologue (RASSF1) (>90%); TP53 (>75%); retinoblastoma- 1 (RB1) (>90%); and retinoic acid receptor-beta (72%). However, to date no biomarkers have been validated for use in diagnosing SCLC. Moreover, mutations that are often present in non-small cell lung cancer (such as epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]) are rare in SCLC. Several clinicopathologic features have been linked with worse prognosis, including poor performance status, significant weight loss, high lactate dehydrogenase levels, large numbers of metastatic sites, and the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes. Because SCLC has the among the highest rates of somatic driver mutations, and because more than 95% of patie ts with SCLC are former or current smokers, immunotherapy seems a reasonable approach, as high mutation burdens correlate with good response to chemoradiotherapy and sensitivity to immunomodulators (Peifer M et al., Nat Genet 2012;44(10):1104-10). At MD Anderson Cancer Center, an ongoing phase I/II study of patients with extensive-stage SCLC has been proposed to the NRG as a prospective randomized study (PI J Welsh) (Fig 2). Use of thoracic radiotherapy to consolidate a site at which SCLC is quite likely to recur is reasonable, given that recurrence considerably reduces quality of their life as well as OS. In summary, in most cases SCLC presents as extensive-stage disease, for which outcomes are very poor. Consolidation with thoracic radiotherapy for patients who achieve a complete response to chemotherapy can improve 2-year OS rates. However, less toxic and more effective systemic treatment is also required to derive the greatest benefit from consolidation thoracic radiotherapy.",Excluded
2472,"Hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown The vascular endothelial cell is believed to be a major target cell of radiation-induced injury to the central nervous system. Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier is associated with radiation-induced white matter lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. Adult rats were irradiated with graded single doses of 0-22 Gy to the cervical spinal cord. At various times up to 28 weeks after radiation, blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability was assessed using immunohistochemistry with antialbumin antibody and gamma counting of (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Hypoxia was assessed using two 2-nitroimidazole markers, [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise and 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-l-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3,-pentafluoropropyl) acetamide (EF5), with binding in the rat spinal cord measured using gamma counting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In the nonirradiated rat spinal cord, there was no evidence of BSCB disruption or VEGF expression. After 16-22 Gy, there was a dose-dependent increase in albumin staining and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid activity beginning at 16 weeks, consistent with barrier breakdown. A similar dose-dependent increase in white matter astrocytes that showed immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization signals for VEGF was observed. No increase in VEGF-positive cells was observed in gray matter. By 20 weeks after 20-22 Gy, animals developed white matter necrosis associated with diffuse albumin staining. Irradiated rat spinal cord showed a dose (16-22 Gy)- and time-dependent (16-20 weeks after 22 Gy) increase in [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise accumulation compared to nonirradiated controls. A similar pattern of dose- and time-dependent EF5 immunoreactivity was also observed in white matter. Areas of EF5 expression and VEGF in situ signals colocalized with areas of albumin immunoreactivity. It is concluded that there is a dose-dependent temporal and spatial association of hypoxia, VEGF up-regulation, and radiation-induced BSCB dysfunction. Hypoxia may provide the signal for VEGF up-regulation and perpetuate endothelial permeability damage in the central nervous system after ionizing radiation.",Included

We observed a significant reduction in SSI among those receiving topical vancomycin compared to those without (0.8% vs 4.9%, p<0.001). The cohorts were similar in demographics and baseline comorbidities, KPS, tumor characteristics, and surgical factors. We identified length-of-stay, previous radiation and preoperative steroid dose as independent risk factors for SSI. Thus, our study identifies potential modifiable risk factors for the prevention of SSI in patient undergoing craniotomy for primary CNS tumors.",Excluded
1285,"Vestibular adaptation to centrifugation does not transfer across planes of head rotation Out-of-plane head movements performed during fast rotation produce non-compensatory nystagmus, sensations of illusory motion, and often motion sickness. Adaptation to this cross-coupled Coriolis stimulus has previously been demonstrated for head turns made in the yaw (transverse) plane of motion, during supine head-on-axis rotation. An open question, however, is if adaptation to head movements in one plane of motion transfers to head movements performed in a new, unpracticed plane of motion. Evidence of transfer would imply the brain builds up a generalized model of the vestibular sensory-motor system, instead of learning a variety of individual input/output relations separately. To investigate, over two days 9 subjects performed pitch head turns (sagittal plane) while rotating, before and after a series of yaw head turns while rotating. A Control Group of 10 subjects performed only the pitch movements. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and sensations of illusory motion were recorded in the dark for all movements. Upon comparing the two groups we failed to find any evidence of transfer from the yaw plane to the pitch plane, suggesting that adaptation to cross-coupled stimuli is specific to the particular plane of head movement. The findings have applications for the use of centrifugation as a possible countermeasure for long duration spaceflight. Adapting astronauts to unconstrained head movements while rotating will likely require exposure to head movements in all planes and directions. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

1771,"Detection of misery perfusion with split-dose <sup>123</sup>I-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with carotid occlusive diseases Background and Purpose - Patients with carotid occlusive disease and stage 2 cerebral hemodynamic failure, characterized by an increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and otherwise known as misery perfusion, have a high risk of cerebral ischemia and subsequent stroke. In clinical practice, the detection of patients with misery perfusion through the use of widely available, noninvasive, and cost-effective modalities such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is extremely important. Methods - We evaluated the relationships between the regional hemodynamic status of cerebral circulation, measured with split-dose [<sup>123</sup>I] N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine SPECT (<sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT) and an acetazolamide challenge, and hemodynamic parameters, including OEF measured with PET, in 27 patients with both unilateral and bilateral carotid occlusive diseases. Results - A significant negative correlation was found between the SPECT-measured cerebrovascular reserve after acetazolamide administration and both the PET-measured OEF and cerebral blood volume. Neither the cerebrovascular reserve nor the cerebral blood flow index, when expressed as a SPECT-measured cerebrum-to-cerebellum ratio, was useful for detecting lesions with an elevated OEF. However, a combination of the cerebrovascular reserve and cerebral blood flow index showed high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the detection of misery perfusion. Conclusions - Our study suggests that split-dose <sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT with an acetazolamide challenge could be useful for screening patients with misery perfusion in carotid occlusive diseases.",Excluded

Chemotherapy is able to convert macroscopic to microscopic disease permitting a dose reduction to the tumor site and possibly the ventricular system and is investigated in prospective trials. Chemotherapy alone cannot replace radiotherapy as sole treatment. Whole-ventricular radiotherapy followed by a boost to tumor site without chemotherapy might be feasible.

In the sequential mode, a transmission scan was carried out using three external sources for the brain phantom without emission tracer. After removing all sources, an emission scan was performed on the brain phantom containing the tracer. In the simultaneous mode, the injection was followed by a simultaneous transmission emission scan using one transmission source. The same study was conducted out for the normal volunteer, after confirming the effectiveness of these protocols with phantom studies. Corrected SPECT count values obtained with two protocols were almost identical. Simultaneous mode had advantages in avoiding misalignment between transmission and emission data and in shorter acquisition time than sequential mode.",Excluded
2285,"Combination of hypomorphic mutations of the Drosophila homologues of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and nucleosome assembly protein family genes disrupts morphogenesis, memory and detoxification Aryl hydrocarbon receptor is essential for biological responses to endogenous and exogenous toxins in mammals. Its Drosophila homolog spineless plays an important role in fly morphogenesis. We have previously shown that during morphogenesis spineless genetically interacts with CG5017 gene, which encodes a nucleosome assembly factor and may affect cognitive function of the fly. We now demonstrate synergistic interactions of spineless and CG5017 in pathways controlling oxidative stress response and long-term memory formation in Drosophila melanogaster. Oxidative stress was induced by low doses of X-ray irradiation of flies carrying hypomorphic mutation of spineless, mutation of CG5017, and their combination. To determine the sensitivity of these mutants to pharmacological modifiers of the irradiation effect, we irradiated flies growing on standard medium supplemented by radiosensitizer furazidin and radioprotector serotonin. The effects of irradiation were investigated by analyzing leg and antenna morphological structures and by using real-time PCR to measure mRNA expression levels for spineless, Cyp6g1 and Gst-theta genes. We also examined long-term memory in these mutants using conditioned courtship suppression paradigm. Our results show that the interaction of spineless and CG5017 is important for regulation of morphogenesis, long-term memory formation, and detoxification during oxidative stress. Since spineless and CG5017 are evolutionary conserved, these results must be considered when evaluating the risk of combining similar mutations in other organisms, including humans.",Excluded
1701,"Effect of protons on the mechanical response of rat muscle nociceptive fibers and neurons in vitro Strong exercise makes muscle acidic, and painful. The stimulus that activates muscle nociceptors in such instance may be protons. Reportedly, however, not many afferents are excited by protons alone. We, therefore, posited that protons sensitize muscular nociceptors to mechanical stimuli. We examined effects of protons on mechanical sensitivity of muscle nociceptors by single-fiber recording from rat muscle-nerve preparations in vitro and by whole cell patch-clamp recording of mechanically activated (MA) currents from cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. We recorded 38 Adelta- and C-fibers. Their response magnitude was increased by both pH 6.2 and pH 6.8; in addition the mechanical threshold was lowered by pH 6.2. Decrease in the threshold by pH6.2 was also observed in MA currents. Presently observed sensitization by protons could be involved in several types of ischemic muscle pain, and may also be involved in cardiovascular and respiratory controls during exercise.",Excluded
1363,"Adult patient doses in interventional neuroradiology We investigated radiation doses to 149 adult patients who underwent interventional neuroradiologic procedures, consisting of 132 patients who had diagnostic imaging examinations and 17 patients who had therapeutic procedures. The interventional procedures were carried out on a biplane system capable of performing fluoroscopy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The x-ray imaging system was interfaced to a patient dosimetry system, which computed surface (skin) doses based on the selected radiographic technique factors in each of the radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging modes. For each patient, an assessment was made of the maximum surface dose received during the procedure, which predicts the possibility of inducing deterministic effects. Knowledge of the surface doses, beam quality and x-ray cross sectional area permitted the computation of the total energy imparted to each patient. Energy imparted values were converted to effective dose, which provides an estimate of the stochastic radiation risk to the patient. The median surface dose for the frontal plane during diagnostic imaging examinations was 1.3 Gy, with a maximum surface dose of 5.1 Gy. The median surface dose for the frontal plane during therapeutic procedures was 2.8 Gy with a maximum surface dose of 5.0 Gy. Ratios of the lateral to frontal median surface doses were 0.47 for diagnostic examinations and 0.68 for interventional procedures. The median energy imparted was 1.8 J during fluoroscopy, and 4.3 J during radiography, showing that on average, 66% of the patient exposure comes from radiographic imaging (DSA). For diagnostic examinations, the median patient effective dose was 33 mSv, with a maximum of 152 mSv. For therapeutic procedures, the median patient effective dose was 74 mSv, with a maximum of 156 mSv. In interventional neuroradiology, surface doses could induce deterministic effects, and the corresponding effective doses are noticeably higher than those normally encountered in diagnostic radiology.",Excluded

2306,"Analysis of the ATM protein in wild-type and ataxia telangiectasia cells Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a human disorder that results in a number of clinical symptoms, including cerebellar degeneration and increased cancer predisposition. Recently the gene that is defective in A-T has been cloned and designated ATM. Here, we describe the production of antisera raised against the approximately 350 kDa ATM protein. Antisera specificity is confirmed by them recognising a approximately 350 kDa polypeptide in wild-type cells but not in A-T cells containing mutations that truncate ATM upstream of the antibody binding sites. We show that ATM is almost exclusively nuclear and is expressed in all cell lines and tissues analysed. However, ATM levels are not regulated in response to u.v. or ionising radiation. These data are consistent with ATM being a component of the DNA damage detection apparatus rather than being an inducible downstream effector of the DNA damage response. In addition, we analyse ATM protein expression in a variety of A-T patients. Strikingly, ATM expression is reduced drastically or absent in all patients analysed, including those predicted to express proteins that should be detected by our antisera. Thus, the A-T phenotype may result not only from mutations that disrupt functional domains of ATM, but also from mutations that destabilise the ATM mRNA or protein. Finally, we report that a group of patients displaying an intermediate A-T phenotype express low levels of apparently full-length ATM. This suggests that the ATM pathway is partially active in these individuals and that there is a correlation between levels of residual ATM expression and disease severity.",Excluded

1861,"Evaluation of results of linac-based radiosurgery for brain metastases from primary lung cancer Aim: The purpose of our review was to evaluate results of radiosurgery for patients with brain metastases from lung cancer. Background(s): Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer and the most common source of brain metastases. Radiosurgery allows the precise focal delivery of a high single radiation dose to brain metastases and results in high rates of local control. Material(s) and Method(s): 83 patients were treated between 2006 and 2008. We evaluated local control and outcome after radiosurgery and identified prognostic factors. Result(s): Median survival in the whole group was 7.8 months from radiosurgery and 11 months from diagnosis. Median survival in classes I, II and III was 13.2, 8.2 and 2.2 months. For 94% of patients symptoms improved or stabilised at the first follow-up visit and this status did not change during 7.1 months. According to the univariate analysis, factors associated with improved survival included: RPA class 1 compared with RPA 2 and 3, RPA class 2 compared with RPA 3, KPS>70, control of the primary disease, radiosurgery performed more than once, level of haemoglobin >7mmol/1, absence of extracranial metastases, volume of the biggest lesion <11cm<sup>3</sup>. The multivariate analysis confirmed a significant influence on survival for the following factors: RPA class 1 as compared with RPA 3, KPS>70, absence of extracranial metastases, multiplicity of radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment. It proved to be effective and safe in older patients. Selection of patients who are likely to benefit most should be based on prognostic factors. KPS proved to be the most important prognostic factor. In the RPA III group (patients with KPS. <. 70) survival time was similar to that achieved after symptomatic medical management. © 2013 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.",Excluded

Method(s): Participants were assessed using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck module (MDASI-HN), with subsequent analysis. Result(s): Of the 122 participants analyzed, the majority (63%) had no frank detectable cognitive impairment by TICS, with frank impairment in 6%. Overall, mean patient-reported problems with memory (MDASI<inf>memory</inf>) was 3.3 (SD +/-2.66). On recursive partition analysis, the MDASI<inf>memory</inf> cutoff point of >=5 was associated with detectable cognitive impairment by TICS (logworth 1.69; P =.02), yet no MDASI<inf>memory</inf> threshold was associated with unambiguous absence of impairment by TICS. Conclusion(s): Approximately one third of patients had ambiguous results by TICS assessment, for whom more rigorous testing may be warranted. Moderate to severe levels of patient-reported memory complaints on the MDASI-HN module may have utility as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction in this population.

1693,"""Critical periods"" in vestibular development or adaptation of gravity sensory systems to altered gravitational conditions? 1. A feature of sensory, neuronal and motor systems is the existence of a critical period during their development. Modification of environmental conditions during this specific period of life affects development in a long-term manner, or even irreversibly. Deprivation is the prefered approach to study the existence and duration of critical periods. For gravity sensory systems, space flights offer the only opportunity for deprivation conditions. 2. Studies in a fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) and an amphibian (Xenopus laevis) revealed a significant sensitivity of their roll-induced static vestibuloocular reflex (rVOR) to a 9- to 10-day gravity deprivation (microgravity) during a spaceflight. In some instances, the rVOR was augmented after the flight as demonstrated in young Oreochromis which were launched when their rVOR had not been developed, and in Xenopus tadpoles launched after their rVOR had developed. Fish which could perform the rVOR at launch were insensitive to microgravity exposure. A similar insensitivity to microgravity was observed in Xenopus tadpoles with normal body shape which had not yet developed their rVOR at launch. Some tadpoles, however, developed an upward bended tail during their space flight; their rVOR was significantly depressed after termination of microgravity independent of the age at onset of the flight. Hypergravity depressed the rVOR for all so far tested developmental stages in both Oreochromis and Xenopus. 3. Both adaptive processes during exposure to altered gravity as well as the existence of a critical period in vestibular development might be responsible for the modulation of the rVOR recorded after exposure to altered gravity. Deprivation studies have to be extended to older developmental stages to test the possibility of a critical period; however, this approach is limited due to the low number of space flights.

The PS analysis showed that in non-irradiated animals but supplemented with omega-3 there was a decrease in the power of the beta rhythm, while the DFA applied to different frequency ranges of the ECoG showed a significant increase in the long-range correlation only for the theta wave when compared with non-supplemented animals. In the evaluation of the radiation effect through the PS, an increase in the power of the theta rhythm was observed in both groups (non-supplemented and supplemented animals) only when they were evaluated one week after irradiation. The DFA method also showed difference in this wave. The PS and DFA methods applied to the ECoG record allowed a quantitative analysis of the cortical electrical activity in rats in response to the omega-3 effects, ionizing radiation, or both.",Included

Motor cortex excitability was tested by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation of the hand area of the left motor cortex. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. In addition, spinal and neuromuscular excitability were tested. All measures were obtained immediately before GFC intake (baseline), and 2, 6, and 24 h later.RESULTS: GFC decreased the slope of the MEP intensity curve, increased paired-pulse short-interval intracortical inhibition, and decreased paired-pulse intracortical facilitation and I-wave facilitation. These effects were maximal at 2-6 h and returned to baseline at 24 h. Motor threshold, cortical silent period, and the measures of spinal (peripheral silent period, F waves) and neuromuscular excitability (maximum M wave) remained unaffected.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on the effects of an anti-noradrenergic drug on human motor cortex excitability. GFC reduced cortical excitability by disfacilitation and increased inhibition. These findings support the idea that anti-noradrenergic drugs are detrimental for cortical plasticity and learning which are down-regulated by disfacilitation or increased inhibition.",Excluded

The patient had noticed a hard induration in the right breast twelve years previously and had a radical operation for right breast cancer. After surgery, she remained well until 7 years ago when she noted a right supraclavicular mass. Based on a diagnosis of metastasis of breast cancer at the right supraclavicular lymph node, she received radiation therapy at 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the lesion. Seven years after radiation therapy, the patient noted muscle weakness of II-V fingers of the right hand, followed by muscle atrophy of the right forearm.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome and toxicity of intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IOERT) in advanced and recurrent EOC.METHODS: Forty-five women with EOC were treated with IOERT. Twenty-five patients had primary disease (PD) without distant metastasis at IOERT, and 20 patients had an isolated local recurrence (ILR) after surgery. All 45 patients in this series underwent optimal cytoreductive (<= 1 cm) surgery. The whole pelvic (WP) radiotherapy was intraoperatively delivered using 12 Mev electron beam; 43 patients received 18-20 Gy and two patients received 10 Gy. Thirty-three patients received postoperateive intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy, while seven patients received intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. Five patients refused concurrent chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Tumor recurrence and metastasis were observed in 16 patients (35.6%). Of those, 14 patients (31.1%) relapsed and two patients (4.4%) had distant metastasis alone. Eight of 25 (32%) local failures were observed in the PD group, as compared to 6/20 (30%) in the ILR group (P = 0.885). Actuarial local control at five year follow-up was 31/45 (68.9%). Seventeen of the total 45 (37.8%) patients died. Nine of 25 (36%) in the PD group died, as compared to 8 of 20 (40%) in the ILR group. The 5-year OS and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 28/45 (62.2%) and 25/45 (55.6%), respectively. In the PD group, the 5-year OS and DFS rates were 16/25 (64%) and 14/25 (56%) (P > 0.05, vs. the ILR group at 12/20 and 11/20, respectively). The OS and DFS in the IOERT plus IP group were 25/33 (75.8%) and 23/33 (69.7%), respectively, which were superior to the rates achieved with IOERT plus IV chemotherapy (P < 0.05, 2/7 and 1/7, respectively). The major complication of IOERT was neuropathy. Five (11.1%) patients developed peripheral neurotoxicity.CONCLUSIONS: IOERT may be feasible and effective as a boosting technique for advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer. IOERT plus IP chemotherapy may achieve high locoregional disease control and survival benefit with a low risk of toxicity. Peripheral nerves in the IOERT field are dose-limiting structures requiring nerve protection policies or a dose compromise to ensure against severe neurological damage.",Excluded

1643,"Thyroid follicular cell carcinogenesis Ample information in experimental animals indicates a relationship between inhibition of thyroid-pituitary homeostasis and the developmental thyroid follicular cell neoplasms. This is generally the case when there are long-term reductions in circulating thyroid hormones which have triggered increases in circulating thyroid stimulating hormone. Such hormonal derangements leading to neoplasms have been produced by different regimens, including dietary iodide deficiency, subtotal thyroidectomy, and administration of natural and xenobiotic chemical substances. The carcinogenic process proceeds through a number of stages, including follicular cell hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and benign and sometimes malignant neoplasms. Given the interrelationship between the thyroid and pituitary glands, conditions that result in stimulation of the thyroid can also result in stimulation of the pituitary, with the development of hyperplastic and neoplastic changes. The progression of events leading to thyroid (and pituitary) neoplasms can be reversed under certain circumstances be reestablishing thyroid-pituitary homeostasis. Most chemicals that have induced follicular cell tumors seem to operate through inhibition of the synthesis of thyroid hormone or an increase in their degradation and removal. For some of these compounds, it appears that genotoxic reactions may not be playing a dominant role in the carcinogenic process. A seemingly small group of thyroid carcinogens seems to lack influence on thyroid-pituitary status and may in part be operating via their genotoxic potential. In contrast with the well-established relationship between thyroid-pituitary derangement and follicular cell neoplasms in animals, the state of information in humans is much less certain. At this time, ionizing radiation is the only acknowledged human thyroid carcinogen, a finding well established in experimental systems as well. Although humans respond to goitrogenic stimuli as do animals, with the development of cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and under certain circumstances nodular lesions, disagreement exists as to whether malignant transformation occurs in any predictable manner. It would seem that if humans develop thyroid tumors following long-term derangement in thyroid-pituitary status, they may be less sensitive than the commonly used animal models.

Using a cranial window model, we showed that anti-VEGF treatment may achieve these effects via normalizing the tumor vasculature, improving vessel perfusion, and delivery of oxygenation. It is known that oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer; therefore, we further demonstrated that combining anti-VEGF with radiation therapy can achieve a better tumor control and help lower the radiation dose and, thus, minimize radiation-related neurological toxicity.

1476,"Mobile computerized tomography scanning in the neurosurgery intensive care unit: Increase in patient safety and reduction of staff workload Object. Transportation of unstable neurosurgical patients involves risks that may lead to further deterioration and secondary brain injury from perturbations in physiological parameters. Mobile computerized tomography (CT) head scanning in the neurosurgery intensive care (NICU) is a new technique that minimizes the need to transport unstable patients. The authors have been using this device since June 1997 and have developed their own method of scanning such patients. Methods. The scanning procedure and radiation safety measures are described. The complications that occurred in 89 patients during transportation and conventional head CT scanning at the Department of Radiology were studied prospectively. These complications were compared with the ones that occurred during mobile CT scanning in 50 patients in the NICU. The duration of the procedures was recorded, and an estimation of the staff workload was made. Two patient groups, defined as high- and medium-risk cases, were studied. Medical and/or technical complications occurred during conventional CT scanning in 25% and 20% of the patients in the high- and medium-risk groups, respectively. During mobile CT scanning complications occurred in 4.3% of the high-risk group and 0% of the medium-risk group. Mobile CT scanning also took significantly less time, and the estimated personnel cost was reduced. Conclusions. Mobile CT scanning in the NICU is safe. It minimizes the risk of physiological deterioration and technical mishaps linked to intrahospital transport, which may aggravate secondary brain injury. The time that patients have to remain outside the controlled environment of the NICU is minimized, and the staff's workload is decreased.",Excluded

High-energy radiation bombardment of intact frozen telencephalon resulted in a biphasic inactivation curve for [3H]AMPA binding. At a 5.8-Mrad radiation dose, the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding was increased (54 nM), but there was no apparent alteration in the Bmax value (2.76 pmol/mg of protein). We attribute this phenomenon to the inactivation of a high molecular weight modulatory protein that down-regulates the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding. The estimated molecular masses of the AMPA binding site and of the modulatory component were 59 and 108 kDa, respectively. Solubilisation with n-octyl-beta-glucopyranoside resulted in an increase in the Bmax (4.7 pmol/mg of protein) with no pronounced alteration in the affinity (109 nM) of [3H]AMPA binding. However, the solubilisation-induced increase in Bmax did not occur in telencephalon irradiated before solubilisation. In contrast, the increase in affinity induced by radiation treatment was still detected in solubilised extracts. These results suggest that the number and affinity of [3H]AMPA sites in chick telencephalon are closely regulated and that the modulatory systems involved are affected by both irradiation and solubilisation.",Excluded

1585,"[""Glare vision"". I. Physiological principles of vision change with increased test field luminance] Clinical tests of visual acuity are an important measure of visual function. However visual acuity is usually determined only in narrow range of luminance levels between 160 and 320 cd/m2; therefore losses of visual acuity in other ranges of light intensity can not be detected. In a distance of 80 cm from the patients eyes, Landolt rings of varying sizes were presented on a small test field whose light intensity can be varied between 0.1 and 30,000 cd/m2. Thereby an acuity-luminance-function can be obtained. We studied such functions under different conditions of exposure time both with constant and with increasing luminance of the test field. We found that persons with normal vision can increase their visual acuity with increasing test field luminance up to a range of 5000 cd/m2. The maximum values of visual acuity under optimal lightening conditions lie (varying with age) between 2.2 and 0.9. Under pathological conditions visual acuity falls at high luminances accompanied by sensations of glare. Tests of glare sensitivity as a function of exposure time showed 4 sec to be a critical time of exposure since after 4 sec normal persons just reach their maximum visual acuity at high luminances. The underlying physiological mechanisms lead us to suppose that patients with neuronal light adaptation disturbances display a greater visual loss as a result of decreased time of exposure than those with disturbances in the ocular media. Visual acuity as well as the capacity to increase the patients visual acuity under optimal conditions of lighting were both found to be strongly age-dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
1338,"Evidence of time-dependent prognostic factors predicting early death but not long-term outcome in primary CNS lymphoma: A Study of 91 patients Long-term primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) survivors could have multiple adverse prognostic factors at diagnosis such as age, performance status (PS), site of the tumour (deep vs superficial), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and CSF protein level. Whether these five prognostic factors integrated in the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) score have a time-dependent effect is questionable. Among 132 PCNSL patients treated at our institution between 1984 and 2006, 91 available patients for IELSG score were evaluated by time-segmented analysis. Of the 91 patients, 21% had 0-1, 59% had 2-3 and 20% had 4-5 adverse IELSG prognostic scores. With a median follow-up of 102months, the median overall survival (OS) of the 91 patients with the five prognostic factors of IELSG score was 33months (95% CI, 17 to 55) compared with 14months (95% CI, 3 to 23) for the remaining 41 patients whose CSF protein level was lacking in the IELSG score. These 41 patients who did not have lumbar puncture presented a poorer PS at diagnosis and a lower treatment response rate. While confirming the prognostic value of the IELSG score, we observed a time-dependent effect of age, PS and tumour site; all three lost their prognostic value after 6months from diagnosis, while LDH remained a constant predictor of OS. No prognostic impact of CSF protein level was reported. Patients with older age, poor PS and deep brain involvement are at risk of death during the first months after diagnosis but could have a favourable long-term outcome after the treatment period. New prognostic factors predicting long-term outcome remain to be determined. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded
2193,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mRNA and protein expression in large versus small diameter dorsal root ganglion neurons: correlation with hyperpolarization-activated current gating Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) are responsible for the functional hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We studied HCN1-4 channel mRNA and protein expression and correlated these findings with I(h) functional properties in rat DRG neurons of different size. Quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) analysis demonstrated that HCN2 and HCN1 mRNAs were more abundantly expressed in large diameter (55-80 microm) neurons, while HCN3 mRNA was preferentially expressed in small diameter (20-30 microm) neurons. HCN4 mRNA expression was very low in neurons of all sizes. At the protein level, subunit-selective polyclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence indicated that HCN1 and HCN3 are present in large diameter neurons and small diameter neurons. Staining in small diameter neurons was in IB4-positive (non-peptidergic) and IB4-negative (peptidergic) cells. HCN2 immunofluorescent staining was heterogeneous and predominantly in large diameter neurons and in small diameter IB4-negative neurons. HCN4 was poorly expressed in all neurons. Functionally, I(h) amplitude and density were significantly larger, and activation kinetics faster, in large diameter neurons when compared with small neurons. I(h) activation rates in small and large diameter DRG neurons were consistent with the relative abundance of HCN subunits in the respective cell type, considering the reported HCN channel activation rates in heterologous systems (HCN1>HCN2 approximately HCN3>HCN4), suggesting exclusivity of roles of different HCN subunits contributing to the excitability of DRG neurons of different size. Additionally, a functional role of I(h) in small DRG neuron excitability was evaluated using a computational model.",Excluded

1561,"Diurnal changes in retinula cell sensitivities and receptive fields (two-dimensional angular sensitivity functions) in the apposition eyes of Ligia exotica (Crustacea, Isopoda) The structural organization of the retinula cells in the eye of Ligia exotica changes diurnally. At night, the microvilli elongate, losing the regular and parallel alignment characteristic of the day condition. Crystalline cones and distal rhabdom tips are not pushed into each other during the day, but at night the rhabdoms protrude into the crystalline cones by up to 5 microm. Screening pigment granules in the retinula cells disperse during the night, but migrate radially towards the vicinity of the rhabdom during the day. No such displacements of the pigment granules of either distal or proximal screening pigment cells were observed. The sensitivity of the eye, monitored by electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, changes diurnally: values at midnight are, on average, 10 times those occurring during the day. However, intracellular recordings from single retinula cells (50 during the day and 50 at night) indicate that the difference between night and day sensitivities is only 2.5-fold. Two-dimensional angular sensitivity curves, indicative of a single unit's spatial sensitivity, had considerably less regular outlines at night than during the day. If based on the 50 % sensitivity level, day and night eyes possessed receptive fields of almost identical width (approximately 2 degrees), but if sensitivities below the 50 % limit were included, then receptive fields at night were significantly more extensive. We suggest that the morphological adaptations and diurnal changes in chromophore content seen in the apposition eye of L. exotica allow this animal to improve its photon capture at night while preserving at least some of the spatial resolving power characteristic of the light-adapted state. This would explain why this animal is capable of performing complex escape behaviours in the presence of predators both in bright and in very dim light.",Excluded
1982,"Angiographic, hemodynamic, and histological changes in an animal model of brain arteriovenous malformations treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery Object Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a major cause of stroke. Many AVMs are effectively obliterated by stereotactic radiosurgery, but such treatment for lesions larger than 3 cm is not as effective. Understanding the responses to radiosurgery may lead to new biological enhancements to this treatment modality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hemodynamic, morphological, and histological effects of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in an animal model of brain AVM. Methods An arteriovenous fistula was created by anastomosing the left external jugular vein to the side of the common carotid artery in 64 male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 345 +/- 8.8 g). Six weeks after AVM creation, 32 rats were treated with a single dose of GKS (20 Gy); 32 animals received sham radiation. Eight irradiated and 8 control animals were studied at each specified time point (1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks) for hemodynamic, morphological, and histological characterization. Results Two AVMs showed partial angiographic obliteration at 6 weeks. Angiography revealed complete obliteration in 3 irradiated rats at 12 weeks. Blood flow in the ipsilateral proximal carotid artery (p < 0.001) and arterialized jugular vein (p < 0.05) was significantly lower in the irradiated group than in the control group. The arterialized vein's external diameter was significantly smaller in GKS-treated animals at 6 (p < 0.05) and 12 (p < 0.001) weeks. Histological changes included subendothelial cellular proliferation and luminal narrowing in GKS-treated animals. Neither luminal obliteration nor thrombus formation was identified at any of the time points in either irradiated or nonirradiated animals. Conclusions GKS produced morphological, angiographic, and histological changes in the model of AVM as early as 6 weeks after treatment. These results support the use of this model for studying methods to enhance radiation response in AVMs. Copyright © AANS, 2015.",Excluded

2013,"A new reference point for patient dose estimation in neurovascular interventional radiology In interventional radiology, dose estimation using the interventional reference point (IRP) is a practical method for obtaining the real-time skin dose of a patient. However, the IRP is defined in terms of adult cardiovascular radiology and is not suitable for dosimetry of the head. In the present study, we defined a new reference point (neuro-IRP) for neuro-interventional procedures. The neuro-IRP was located on the central ray of the X-ray beam, 9 cm from the isocenter, toward the focal spot. To verify whether the neuro-IRP was accurate in dose estimation, we compared calculated doses at the neuro-IRP and actual measured doses at the surface of the head phantom for various directions of the X-ray projection. The resulting calculated doses were fairly consistent with actual measured doses, with the error in this estimation within approximately 15%.

Four questions addressed distal and proximal paresis: impaired hand functions, problems raising the arm, carrying weights, and lifting objects from a high shelf. Eighty-one relapse-free patients were neurologically examined. Treatment was mastectomy (51%) or breast-conserving surgery (49%), radiotherapy to the supraclavicular +/- axilla with median 60 Gy maximum dose. Sixty-five subsequent control patients had breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy to the breast only with 55 Gy median dose. Median follow up was 10 and 7.4 years, respectively. Sixteen patients had RIBP, 7 had Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 1, 4 grade 2, 3 grade 3, and 2 grade 4 RIBP. Thirty-seven patients had fibrosis and 32 had arm edema. Four patients with RIBP had no fibrosis (n = 2) or fibrosis of the axilla only (n = 2). Specificity of the question ""impaired hand functions"" for RIBP was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.78); sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96). Specificity of the question ""raising the arm"" was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.9-0.99) and sensitivity was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04-0.45); the rate of false-positive control patients was 3%. In multivariate analysis, ""impaired hand functions"" and fibrosis were independent indicators of RIBP (P <0.005). Patients with breast irradiation only stated moderate/pronounced impaired hand functions; and problems carrying weights and lifting objects from a high shelf in 38%, 58%, and 77%, not significantly different from patients with RIBP or the patients with supraclavicular radiation. RIBP is not necessarily associated with fibrosis. The aim of the questionnaire was screening of a population at risk for RIBP. In this group, the question ""problems raising the arm"" detected severe RIBP with high specificity. Negation of ""impaired hand functions"" excludes RIBP.

Also antiproliferative effects have been reported against glioblastoma cell lines. DESIGN/METHODS: LAZ PEGylated liposomes (Lipo G) were developed at the University of Houston.. Glioblastoma cell line U87-expressing firefly luciferase reporter gene (100,000 cells in 2 mL) was injected intracranially in each SCID mouse. There were 4 treatment groups (n = 8-9, each): brain model (M) without treatment (control), radiation 2Gy weekly (M + R), LipoGat 5 mug/kg dose intraperitoneally twice per week (M + L) and radiation with LipoG(M + R + L). Treatment lasted three weeks. Tumor size was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), in each mouse. Mice were sacrificed after 3 weeks. Brain was harvested. Lipid peroxidation of brain tissues was quantified by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) as a surrogate biomarker. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan Meier analysis at P= 0.05. RESULT(S): BLI intensity was 4002.03+/-1737.67, 2034+/-737.72, 1387.36+/-684.53 and 2498.89+/-2521.32 % for M, M + R, M+ L and M + R + L, respectively. Tumor size of the M+ L group was reduced by 65% compared to control. There was no significant difference in tumor size of radiated groups compared to control group.MDAbrain concentration inM+ L andM+ R + L groups was significantly less than in M+ R group (8.27+/-0.78 and 10.37+/- 3.30 muM/gm vs. 23.09+/- 3.79 muM/gm).

1810,"Evaluation of effective dose from a RANDO phantom in videofluorography diagnostic procedures for diagnosing dysphagia Objectives: Videofluorography (VF) is useful for diagnosing dysphagia; however, few reports have investigated appropriate effective doses for VF. The present study aimed to estimate the effective radiation dose in VF for diagnosis of dysphagia. Method(s): Radiation doses to tissues and organs were measured using the anthropomorphic RANDO woman phantom as an equivalent to the human body. Effective doses were estimated according to the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) 60 in 1990 and IRCP 103 in 2007. The tissues measured were those recommended by ICRP 60 and ICRP 103 including gonads (ovaries and testes), red bone marrow and tissues in which excessive radiation commonly causes malignant tumours including lung, thyroid gland, stomach, large intestine, liver, oesophagus, bladder, breast, bone marrow, skin, brain and salivary gland. Skin dose was also measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters. Result(s): Using ICRP 103, the effective dose was estimated as 118.1 muSv at a tube voltage of 50 kV and 82.4 muSv at 45 kV. However, using ICRP 60 the effective dose for 1 min of VF was estimated at 62.4 muSv and 47.2 muSv under the same exposure conditions. Conclusion(s): Using ICRP 103, the effective dose for VF per examination at a total estimation time of 1 min was estimated as approximately 2.5-8.3 times that observed for digital panoramic radiography and 1/12 to 3 times depending on the measurement device for cone beam CT (CBCT).

1580,"Inhibition of PI3K signalling increases the efficiency of radiotherapy in glioblastoma cells Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumour, is also considered one of the most lethal cancers per se. It is highly refractory to therapeutic intervention, as highlighted by the mean patient survival of only 15 months, despite an aggressive treatment approach, consisting of maximal safe surgical resection, followed by radio- and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy, in particular, can have effects on the surviving fractions of tumour cells, which are considered adverse to the desired clinical outcome: It can induce increased cellular proliferation, as well as enhanced invasion. In this study, we established that differentiated glioblastoma cells alter their DNA repair response following repeated exposure to radiation and, therefore, high single-dose irradiation (SD-IR) is not a good surrogate marker for fractionated dose irradiation (FD-IR), as used in clinical practice. Integrating irradiation into a combination therapy approach, we then investigated whether the pharmacological inhibition of PI3K signalling, the most abundantly activated survival cascade in glioblastoma, enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy. Of note, treatment with GDC-0941, which blocks PI3K-mediated signalling, did not enhance cell death upon irradiation, but both treatment modalities functioned synergistically to reduce the total cell number. Furthermore, GDC-0941 not only prevented the radiation-induced increase in the motility of the differentiated cells, but further reduced their speed below that of untreated cells. Therefore, combining radiotherapy with the pharmacological inhibition of PI3K signalling is a potentially promising approach for the treatment of glioblastoma, as it can reduce the unwanted effects on the surviving fraction of tumour cells.",Excluded
1270,"Complications of gamma knife neurosurgery and their appropriate management There are four main risks with Gamma Knife neurosurgery. Firstly, there are direct complications that would not have arisen if the patient had not undergone the specific treatment under consideration. For radiosurgery, the direct complications are radiation-induced damage to the tissues, which may be temporary or permanent. They may be expressed clinically or be clinically silent. In addition, there are complications that are specific to certain diseases and their locations, such as pituitary failure following treatment of pituitary adenomas and deafness, facial palsy, or trigeminal deficit following the treatment of vestibular schwannomas. Second, there are indirect or management-related complications arising from delayed control of the disease process, such as a re-bleed after treatment of a vascular lesion before its occlusion. Third, there is the risk of induction of neoplasia from irradiation of normal tissue or tumor. These are separate processes. An example of the first would be induction of a glioma after treatment of a vascular malformation. An example of the second would be induction of malignant change in a benign vestibular schwannoma.

Biological effective dose (BED) is a dosimetric parameter that incorporates a time component to adjust for mechanisms of deoxyribonucleic acid repair activated during treatment.OBJECTIVE: To assess mean gland BED as a predictor of post-SRS hypopituitarism, as compared to mean gland dose, in a contemporary cohort study of patients undergoing single-fraction SRS for pituitary adenoma.METHODS: Cohort study of 97 patients undergoing single-fraction SRS from 2007 to 2014. Eligible patients had no prior pituitary irradiation, normal pre-SRS endocrine function, and >24 mo of endocrine follow-up. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess mean gland dose and BED as predictors of new post-SRS hypopituitarism.RESULTS: Median post-SRS follow-up was 48 mo (interquartile range [IQR], 34-68). A total of 27 patients (28%) developed new hypopituitarism at a median 22 mo (IQR, 12-36). Actuarial rates of new endocrinopathy were 17% at 2 yr (95% CI 10%-25%) and 31% at 5 yr (95% CI 20%-42%). On univariate analysis, sex (P = .02), gland volume (P = .03), mean gland dose (P < .0001), and BED significantly predicted new hypopituitarism (P < .0001).

1935,"Radiation dose reduction using real-time image processing in interventional radiology Purpose: To characterize changes in radiation dose after introducing a new real-time image processing technology in interventional radiology systems. Method(s): Interventional radiology (IR) procedures are increasingly complex, at times requiring substantial time and radiation dose. The risk of inducing tissue reactions as well as long-term stochastic effects such as radiation-induced cancer is not trivial. To reduce this risk, IR systems are increasingly equipped with dose reduction technologies. Recently, ClarityIQ (Philips Healthcare) technology was installed in our existing neuroradiology IR (NIR) and vascular IR (VIR) suites respectively. ClarityIQ includes realtime image processing that reduces noise/artifacts, enhances images, and sharpens edges while also reducing radiation dose rates. We reviewed 412 NIR (175 pre-and 237 post-ClarityIQ) procedures and 329 VIR (156 preand 173 post-ClarityIQ) procedures performed at our institution pre-and post-ClarityIQ implementation. NIR procedures were primarily classified as interventional or diagnostic. VIR procedures included drain port, drain placement, tube change, mesenteric, and implanted venous procedures. Air Kerma (AK in units of mGy) was documented for all the cases using a commercial radiation exposure management system. Result(s): When considering all NIR procedures, median AK decreased from 1194 mGy to 561 mGy. When considering all VIR procedures, median AK decreased from 49 to 14 mGy. Both NIR and VIR exhibited a decrease in AK exceeding 50% after ClarityIQ implementation, a statistically significant (p<0.05) difference. Of the 5 most common VIR procedures, all median AK values decreased, but significance (p<0.05) was only reached in venous access (N=53), angio mesenteric (N=41), and drain placement procedures (N=31).

Patients are scheduled for 4 treatments with 8-10 weeks in between. Cells in the red bone marrow are vulnerable to radiation and are together with the kidneys the organs at risk in patients undergoing 177Lu-Dotatate therapy. The effective dose given to the red bone marrow can be estimated from the calculated accumulated radioactivity in the blood. Aim(s): To described the procedure for collection of blood samples, measurement of radioactivity in the blood and for estimating the effective dose to bone marrow following 177Lu-Dotatate therapy. Method(s): At the first treatment a total of eight blood samples is collected at the following time points: 45, 90, 150 and 210 minutes, 8 and 24 hours, and 4 and 7 days after the administration of 177Lu-Dotatate. For the following three treatments no blood samples are collected at day 4 and 7, resulting in a total of six samples. The first four blood samples are drawn from a venflon or venipuncture in the opposite arm of the infusion of the radionuclide in order to avoid contamination of the samples. The exact time of sampling is recorded for all blood samples. The activity of Lu-177 in the blood is so high shortly after administration that even small sample volumes causes lack of accuracy due to the dead time of the counting apparatus. Therefore samples are stored for seven days before they are prepared for counting. Measurements during the development of the data collection procedure showed that the radioactivity was at least 1.5 greater in whole blood than in plasma. Measurement of radioactivity is therefore done on whole blood from which samples of 500 muL blood is taken. The amount of Lu-177 in the 500 muL blood samples (duplicate samples for every time point) is measured in a well counter (Canberra Cobra-II auto-gamma) using a 15-400 keV window and a counting time of 10 min which is sufficient for good count statistics. Based on the measured cpm/sample the Lu-177 concentration in the blood (Bq/ml) is calculated for every time point and the result are plotted in a time-activity graph. Conclusion(s): It is possible to measure accumulated radioactivity in the blood over time and thereby estimate the effective dose to the red bone marrow using a time-activity graph obtained from the described procedure.",Excluded

2215,"Electrophysiological characterisation of the infrared organ of the Australian ""Little Ash Beetle"" Acanthocnemus nigricans (Coleoptera, Acanthocnemidae) This study characterises the response properties of the sensilla located on the prothoracic disc organ of the beetle Acanthocnemus nigricans, such as intensity response functions and temporal coding properties. Warming the sensilla by a red laser accelerated their ongoing spiking activity, cessation of the stimulus suppressed their firing as revealed by extracellular recordings. Convective heat sources also increased sensillum activity, but stimuli of other modalities failed to elicit responses. The response threshold was between 11 and 25 mW/cm2 and latencies ranged between 20 and 40 ms. Repeating stimuli with frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz were reliably resolved by the sensilla. This temporal resolution enables the disc sensilla to represent behaviourally relevant changes in heat stimuli in a thermally patchy environment. These findings complement our knowledge on the sensory physiology of pyrophilous insects by hinting at two different, elementary orientation strategies evolved in the three pyrophilous beetle species described. A. nigricans seems to be best adapted to short-range orientation on freshly burnt areas.",Excluded
2481,"Short- and long-term effects of irradiation on laryngeal mucosa of the rat Although radiotherapy is often used to treat laryngeal carcinoma, there is little information on the effects of this treatment on laryngeal structures. Rats were irradiated to the head and neck region and the larynges were studied by light- and electron-microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Ten days after irradiation, a change in the ultrastructural appearance of the granules of the subglottic glands was observed. Substance P-, bombesin- and enkephalin-like immunoreactivity was increased in local ganglionic cells and glandular nerve fibres. The mast cells were reduced in number. At examination 4 6 months after irradiation, there were no obvious differences compared with controls concerning mast-cell numbers and neuropeptide expression. The ultrastructural changes seen in the subglottic glands remained to some extent. The results show that structural changes in the subglottic glands occur concomitantly with an increased expression of certain neuropeptides in the innervation of these glands, which implies a relationship between these two parameters. The mast cells respond drastically to irradiation, but in the long run, regeneration of these cells occurs.",Included

1218,"Isotopic cisternography in detection of CSF rhinorrhea. [German] The radioisotope cisternogram has proven itself to be a valuable diagnostic procedure during the evaluation of patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. If it is not possible to define the origin of such a leak, extensive intracranial explorations may be required, which may or may not result in successful correction of the defect. As a functional examination with limited risk to the patient and minimal radiation exposure, the isotopic cisternogram can either establish a diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea or eliminate cerebrospinal fluid as a cause for rhinorrhea. When occurring, CSF leaks can be shown by demonstrating a 'path' from the cranial fossage into the nasal cavity. The present technique utilizes tampons placed in each nostril. A positive diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea is made by finding a tampon impregnated with at least twice the radioactivity of a control tampon from the opposite nostril (in the presence of an intact septum). Conclusions indicate that a positive anterior fossa cisternogram may be the only evidence for hidden site of CSF leakage, especially when other signs are lacking.",Excluded

Indeed, with the improvement of the patient's life expectancy, side effects must be undeniably avoided and the retreatments or multiple treatments are common. The cognitive side effects should be warned and the most modern techniques of radiation therapy are used regularly to reach this goal. The new classifications of patients with brain metastases help guiding treatment more appropriately. Stereotactic radiotherapy has supplanted whole brain radiation therapy both for patients with metastases in place and for those who underwent surgery. Hippocampus protection is possible with intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

1865,"Structural Basis of the Molecular Switch between Phosphatase and Mutase Functions of Human Phosphomannomutase 1 under Ischemic Conditions The human phosphomannomutases PMM1 and PMM2 catalyze the interconversion of hexose 6-phosphates and hexose 1-phosphates. The two isoforms share 66% sequence identity and have kinetic properties similar to those of mutases in vitro but differ in their functional roles in vivo. Though the physiological role of PMM2 is catalysis of the mutase reaction that provides the mannose 1-phosphate (Man-1-P) essential for protein glycosylation, PMM1 is thought to provide a phosphohydrolase activity in the presence of inosine monophosphate (IMP), converting glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Glu-1,6-P<inf>2</inf>) to glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P), rescuing glycolysis during brain ischemia. To uncover the structural basis of how IMP binding converts PMM1 from a mutase to a phosphatase, the 1.93 A resolution structure of PMM1 complexed with IMP was determined. The structure reveals IMP bound at the substrate recruitment site, thus inhibiting the mutase activity while simultaneously activating a phosphatase activity (IMP K<inf>act</inf> = 1.5 muM) resulting from the hydrolysis of the phospho-enzyme. The bound structure and site-directed mutagenesis confirm that the long-range electrostatic interactions provided by Arg180 and Arg183 conserved in PMM1 are the major contributors to IMP binding, and their oblation removes phosphatase but not mutase activity. These residues are not present in the PMM2 isoform, which consequently lacks significant phosphatase activity in the presence of IMP. T<inf>2</inf> relaxation nuclear magnetic resonance and small angle X-ray scattering together support the hypothesis that binding of IMP to PMM1 favors an enzyme conformation that is catalytically competent for water attack at the phosphoaspartyl intermediate. Such a mechanism may be generalizable to other enzymes that act through covalent intermediates. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",Excluded
1374,"Theranostic potential of a new [64Cu]-radiolabeled R-954 conjugate for kinin B1R positive tumors Objectives The inducible GPCR B1 receptor (B1R) is a molecular signature of several types of solid cancers, including brain cancer. It is thought to be involved in tumor growth, invasion and angiogenesis. Thus, the B1R may represent a highly promising new target for the development of cancer-targeted theranostic agents Methods We developed a new 64Cu/NOTA-conjugated analog of our potent, selective B1R peptide antagonist, R-954 (AcOrn[Oic2,(alphaMe)Phe5,DbetaNal7,Ile8]-desArg9-bradykinin). Stability of the resulting peptide conjugate was evaluated ex vivo in undiluted rat blood samples and in vivo within systemic circulation in healthy rats. Intracellular uptake/nuclear localization and radiocytotoxicity of the conjugate were studied in cultured F98 glioma cells. In vivo biodistribution profile and efficacy of detection of malignant brain tumors by PET, were evaluated using the syngeneic, orthotopic F98 glioma rat model Results 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 showed remarkable stability in rat plasma after a 24h incubation. In vivo stability study showed mainly intact radiolabeled peptide (no occurrence of radiotracer metabolites) in rat blood circulation and urine, 90min after tail-vein injection. In vitro, the conjugate supressed, in a concentration-dependent manner, clonogenic growth of F98 cells possibly through an intracellular radiation mechanism (i.e. via cellular/nuclear uptake). Intravenous 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 properly detected relatively small brain tumors by PET at 1.5h and 20h after injection. Moreover, muPET signals coincided perfectly with those of contrast-enhanced MRI. The conjugate exhibited high tumor-to-contralateral background uptake and tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios (18:1 and 6:1, respectively) at 20h after injection. muPET signals generated by the radiotracer were i) inhibitable with excess of the unlabeled B1R antagonist R-954, ii) substantially reduced in B1R-knockdown F98 tumors, and iii) primarily absent in sham-operated animals, thus confirming the B1R-targeted tumor uptake specificity of the conjugate Conclusions Our findings provide initial proof-of-concept for the potential use of 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 radiotracer in both diagnosis and treatment of brain cancer, and possibly other types of B1R-positive solid cancers.",Excluded

Clinical, biochemical, and microscopic and ultramicroscopic studies were performed. An open-label trial of capsaicin cream application was initiated in 15 patients.RESULTS: An almost equal number of men and women were seen with an average age of 44 years. Brown-eyed and blue-eyed patients were seen with equal frequency. Most patients (86%) had outdoor occupations or avocations. The pruritus was intense, usually bilateral (72%) and invariably affected the lateral (as opposed to medial) aspects of the arm(s) in the absence of primary lesions. The most commonly affected area was the elbow area superficial to the brachioradialis and extensor carpi longus muscles, but extension of the pruritus to include the forearm and/or upper arm was common. Biopsy specimens (stained with hematoxylin and eosin) were normal or showed mild actinic elastosis in 15 patients tested. Ultramicroscopy showed myelin sheath splitting in all four patients studied. This is a nonspecific finding that may also be found in diabetic or alcoholic neuropathy. Ten of thirteen patients completing the capsaicin-cream study found significant relief (itching much improved or gone) after 3 weeks compared with the untreated control arm.CONCLUSIONS: The cause of solar pruritus remains unknown, but circumstantial evidence implicates chronic exposure to solar radiation. Capsaicin may offer relief to these patients, but the patients need to be cautioned about the burning sensation that occurs with capsaicin cream.",Excluded

1375,"Evaluation of intracellular and extracellular domoic acid content in Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cell cultures under different light regimes Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries is a diatom species associated with the production of domoic acid (DA), a water soluble neurotoxin that is easily transferred up in the food web, causing devastating effects on top marine organisms and humans. Despite studies on Pseudo-nitzschia are relevant to human health safety, partitioning of marine toxins between intracellular and extracellular fractions are poorly documented. This study aimed to determine the growth rates and DA content, both intracellular and extracellular, of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cultures at three different light settings (15, 120 and 560mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The optimal conditions for cell growth were observed at 120 and 560mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, whereas DA production was observed in P. multiseries at 15 and 120mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, ranging between 0.18-2.56 and 0.16-3.5pg DA cell<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Higher intracellular DA concentrations were found during the senescence phase at low light intensity and during the exponential phase at medium light intensity, while higher concentrations of dissolved DA were found at low and medium light intensities in the senescence phase reaching 3 and 10ng DA mL<sup>-1</sup> respectively. The amount of toxin released into the culture medium represents the most important fraction ranging between 63 and 98% during the exponential phase and nearly 99% during the senescence phase. In contrast, under low light intensity, dissolved DA was detected in the culture medium only during the senescence phase. This study confirms the importance of light intensity on DA production and clearly shows that dissolved domoic acid is an important fraction in Pseudo-nitzschia cultures, suggesting with the careful assumptions of results from static cultures extrapolated to bloom situations that waterborne exposure of marine organism should be considered during blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries.",Excluded

Optimal management of recurrent CNSL is poorly defined. Objective We aim to determine the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of recurrent CNSL. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of patients having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for recurrent intracranial CNSL between 1999 and 2011. Results Fourteen patients (20 tumors) underwent SRS. The median patient age was 71 years (range, 18-82 years). Seven patients (50%) had primary CNSL. All had received prior chemotherapy, and nine patients (64%) had undergone prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with a median dose of 40 Gy in 25 fractions. The median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Score was 80. The median tumor volume was 6.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 0.5-37.7); the median margin dose was 15.5 Gy (range, 10-18). Eleven patients (79%) had tumor regression (n = 11) shown on MRI after SRS. The median overall survival after SRS was 9.5 months. No patient had a major radiation-related complication. Conclusion Stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with recurrent CNSL is well tolerated and has a high rate of radiographic response. A marginal dose of 15.5 Gy or greater, a Karnofsky score of 80 or greater, and the absence of pre-SRS WBRT were associated with significantly longer overall survival.

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of 11C-methionine (MET)-PET radiomics for distinguishing recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, as compared with conventional tumor-to-normal cortex (T/N) ratio evaluation. We enrolled 41 patients with metastatic brain tumor or glioma treated using radiation therapy who underwent MET-PET. The area with a standardized uptake value > 1.3 times that of the normal brain cortex was contoured. Forty-two PET features were extracted and used in a random forest classifier and the diagnostic performance was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Gini index was measured to identify relevant PET parameters for classification. The reference standard was surgical histopathological analysis or more than 6 months of follow-up with MRI. Forty-four lesions were used for the analysis. Thirty-three and 11 lesions were confirmed as recurrent brain tumor and radiation necrosis, respectively. Radiomics and T/N ratio evaluation showed sensitivities of 90.1% and 60.6%, and specificities of 93.9% and 72.7% with areas under the curve of 0.98 and 0.73, respectively.

2098,"Surgeon education decreases radiation dose in complex endovascular procedures and improves patient safety OBJECTIVE: Complex endovascular procedures such as fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) are associated with higher radiation doses compared with other fluoroscopically guided interventions (FGIs). The purpose of this study was to determine whether surgeon education on radiation dose control can lead to lower reference air kerma (RAK) and peak skin dose (PSD) levels in high-dose procedures.METHODS: Radiation dose and operating factors were recorded for FGI performed in a hybrid room over a 16-month period. Cases exceeding 6 Gy RAK were investigated according to institutional policy. Information obtained from these investigations led to surgeon education focused on reducing patient dose. Points addressed included increasing table height, utilizing collimation and angulation, decreasing magnification modes, and maintaining minimal patient-to-detector distance. Procedural RAK doses and operating factors were compared 8 months pre- (group A) and 8 months post- (group B) educational intervention using analysis of variance with Tukey pairwise comparisons and t-tests. PSD distributions were calculated using custom software employing input data from fluoroscopic machine logs.RESULTS: Of 447 procedures performed, 300 FGIs had sufficient data to be included in the analysis (54% lower extremity, 11% thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair, 10% cerebral, 8% FEVAR, 7% endovascular aneurysm repair, 5% visceral, and 5% embolization). Twenty-one cases were investigated for exceeding 6 Gy RAK. FEVAR comprised 70% of the investigated cases and had a significantly higher median RAK dose compared with all other FGIs (P < .0001). There was no difference in body mass index between groups A and B; however, increasing body mass index was an indicator for increased RAK. PSD calculations were performed for the 122 procedures that focused on the thorax and abdomen (group A, 80 patients; group B, 42 patients). Surgeon education most strongly affected table height, with an average table height elevation of 10 cm per case after education (P < .0001). The dose index (PSD/RAK ratio) was used to track changes in operating practices, and it decreased from 1.14 to 0.79 after education (P < .0001). These changes resulted in an estimated 16% reduction in PSD. There was a trend toward a decrease in patient to detector distance, and the use of collimation increased from 25% to 40% (P < .001) for all cases; however, these did not result in a decrease in PSD. The number of cases that exceeded 6 Gy RAK did not change after education; however, the proportion of non-FEVAR cases that exceeded 6 Gy decreased from 40% to 20%.CONCLUSIONS: Surgeon education on the appropriate use of technical factors during FGIs improved operating practice, reduced patient radiation dose, and decreased the number of non-FEVAR cases that exceeded 6 Gy. It is essential that vascular surgeons be educated in best operating practices to lower PSD; nonetheless, FEVAR remains a high-dose procedure.",Excluded

She had menstruated once, when she was 13 years old. When she was 14 years old, she was diagnosed with a suprasellar germinoma measuring 10 mm in diameter, which led to diabetes insipidus. Cranial irradiation with a total dose of 24 Gy and chemotherapy resulted in complete tumor remission. She developed severe hypopituitarism [luteinizing hormone (LH) = 0.4 mIU/mL, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) = 1.7 mIU/mL, and serum estradiol (E2) level < 10 pg/mL]. She had received multiple hormone replacement therapies for many years. When she was 29 years old, she expressed a desire to become pregnant. Serum gonadotropin and E2 levels increased (LH = 5.8 mIU/mL, FSH = 5.9 mIU/mL, and E2 = 58 pg/mL). She conceived with clomiphene therapy, and then delivered a healthy baby. Eight months after parturition, her basal body temperature and serum progesterone levels indicated recovery of ovulatory cycles. Ten months after parturition, she also spontaneously conceived.Conclusion: Menstrual restoration is very rare in severe panhypopituitarism after cranial irradiation.

2055,"Successful endoscopic hemostasis with cryotherapy for a case of refractory esophageal cancer bleeding Gastrointestinal malignancy bleeding (GIMB) can be a clinical challenge. Options for treatment include surgical resection, radiation, angiography with embolization and endoscopic treatment (ET). Currently there is no standard of care for ET of GIMB. Modalities tried in the past include epinephrine injection, contact thermal devices, argon plasma coagulation (APC) and hemoclip (HC) placement. Cryotherapy (cryo) is a modality used for tumor ablation. It has also been successfully used in treatment of benign bleeding such as radiation proctitis and gastric antral vascular ectasia. There is one case report of cryo use in refractory GIMB leading to short term hemostasis (HS). We present a case of long term HS achieved by cryo in a patient with refractory GIMB. A 51 year old male with a history of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presented with melena. He was successfully treated with APC and was then referred for external beam radiation to prevent further bleeding. This combination achieved HS for around 8 months after which he presented with recurrent melena. A second attempt at treatment with APC achieved initial hemostasis but bleeding recurred 2 days later. Cryo was offered to him to aid with his dysphagia and possibly hemostasis. On EGD a fungating tumor oozing blood was seen in the distal third of the esophagus. Cryo was performed with 15 second freeze cycles. The patient experienced significant improvement in his dysphagia and resolution of his melena. The patient expired 2 months later due to newly diagnosed brain metastasis without recurrence of his melena. ET of GIMB continues to be a challenge. Multiple modalities can be tried including standard hemostatic maneuvers. Bleeding often recurs and can become refractory. Hemospray has been reported to be effective in these situations but is not available in the United States. Cryo, proven effective in refractory benign bleeding and approved for tumor ablation was used successfully in this patient. Cryo effect at standard application duration is limited to the superficial 5 mm of tissue. In addition to tumor necrosis has the theoretical advantage of forming crystal in the microvasculature leading to thrombosis and possibly hemostasis. This is a case of long term hemostasis achieved by cryotherapy in a patient with refractory tumor bleeding. A prospective study is needed to determine whether these effects can be reproduced in other patients. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

Acute flank pain is a frequent clinical presentation encountered in emergency departments, and a work-up for obstructive urolithiasis in this setting is a common indication for computed tomography (CT). However, imaging alternatives to CT for the evaluation of renal colic are warranted in some clinical situations, such as younger patients, pregnancy, patients that have undergone multiple prior CT exams and also patients with vague clinical presentations. MRI, although relatively insensitive for the direct detection of urinary calculi, has the ability to detect the secondary effects of obstructive urolithiasis. Using rapid, single shot T2-weighted sequences without and with fat saturation provides an abdominopelvic MR examination that can detect the sequelae of clinically active stone disease, in addition to alternate inflammatory processes that may mimic the symptoms of renal colic. In addition, MR nephro-urography (MRNU) has the ability to provide quantitative analysis of renal function that has the potential to direct clinical management in the setting of obstructing calculi.

Anesthetized female Fisher 344 rats received irradiation to 2 cm of the cervical spine with a telecobalt unit (dose rate 1.14 Gy/min). Radiation was administered in two, four or eight fractions spread over a 48-h period with or without fludarabine. Animals assigned to combined therapy received two daily intraperitoneal injections of fludarabine (150 mg/kg) given 3 h prior to the first daily radiation fraction. It was found that fludarabine reduced the iso-effect dose required to induce leg paresis at 9 months after irradiation for all fractionation schedules. Dose modification factors of 1.23, 1.29 and greater than 1.27 were obtained for two, four and eight fractions, respectively. Fitting the data with the direct analysis method of Thames et al. with an incomplete repair model [18] showed that the potentiating effect of fludarabine may be mediated through reduction in the number of 'tissue-rescuing units' (InK). Alpha and beta values were slightly but not significantly decreased, whereas the alpha/beta ratio was unchanged. These features suggest that fludarabine did not significantly inhibit cellular repair processes but rather reduced the spinal cord tolerance by a fixed additive toxic effect on the same target cells. In rodent models, the combination of fludarabine and fractionated radiation has previously been found to yield a therapeutic gain, i.e., the drug enhanced tumor response to a greater extent than it reduced normal tissue tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

2063,"Late effects of <sup>1</sup>H irradiation on hippocampal physiology NASA's Missions to Mars and beyond will expose flight crews to potentially dangerous levels of charged-particle radiation. Of all charged nuclei, <sup>1</sup>H is the most abundant charged particle in both the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) and solar particle event (SPE) spectra. There are currently no functional spacecraft shielding materials that are able to mitigate the charged-particle radiation encountered in space.

1365,"Treatment of radiation-induced nervous system injury with heparin and warfarin When radiation is used to treat nervous system cancer, exposure of adjacent normal nervous system tissue is unavoidable, and radiation-induced injury may occur. Acute injury is usually mild and transient, but late forms of radiation-induced nervous system injury are usually progressive and debilitating. Treatment with corticosteroids, surgery, and antioxidants is often ineffective. We treated 11 patients with late radiation-induced nervous system injuries (eight with cerebral radionecrosis, one with a myelopathy, and two with plexopathies, all unresponsive to dexamethasone and prednisone) with full anticoagulation. Some recovery of function occurred in five of the eight patients with cerebral radionecrosis, and all the patients with myelopathy or plexopathy. Anticoagulation was continued for 3 to 6 months. In one patient with cerebral radionecrosis, symptoms recurred after discontinuation of anticoagulation and disappeared again after reinstitution of treatment. We hypothesize that anticoagulation may arrest and reverse small-vessel endothelial injury--the fundamental lesion of radiation necrosis--and produce clinical improvement in some patients.",Excluded

2314,"Mapping by laser photostimulation of connections between the thalamic reticular and ventral posterior lateral nuclei in the rat We used laser scanning photostimulation through a focused UV laser of caged glutamate in an in vitro slice preparation through the rat's somatosensory thalamus to study topography and connectivity between the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral posterior lateral nucleus. This enabled us to focally stimulate the soma or dendrites of reticular neurons. We were thus able to confirm and extend previous observations based mainly on neuroanatomical pathway tracing techniques: the projections from the thalamic reticular nucleus to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus have precise topography. The reticular zone, which we refer to as a ""footprint,"" within which photostimulation evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in relay cells, was relatively small and oval, with the long axis being parallel to the border between the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral posterior lateral nucleus. These evoked IPSCs were large, and by using appropriate GABA antagonists, we were able to show both GABA(A) and GABA(B) components. This suggests that photostimulation strongly activated reticular neurons. Finally, we were able to activate a disynaptic relay cell-to-reticular-to- relay cell pathway by evoking IPSCs in relay cells from photostimulation of the region surrounding a recorded relay cell. This, too, suggests strong responses of relay cells, responses strong enough to evoke spiking in their postsynaptic reticular targets. The regions of photostimulation for these disynaptic responses were much larger than the above-mentioned reticular footprints, and this suggests that reticulothalamic axon arbors are less widespread than thalamoreticular arbors, that there is more convergence in thalamoreticular connections than in reticulothalamic connections, or both.",Excluded
1864,"Increased hippocampal TrkA expression ameliorates cranial radiation-induced neurogenesis impairment and cognitive deficit via PI3K/AKT signaling Cognitive deficit is one of the most serious complications of cranial radiotherapy of head and neck cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of this cognitive impairment remains unclear. In the present study, the role of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and its ligand neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) were investigated following whole-brain irradiation (WBI). Young male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent WBI at a single dose of 10 Gy. WBI was determined to result in notable memory decline and substantial neurogenesis impairment in the hippocampus 3 months post-irradiation. Compared with the control group, TrkA protein expression was greater in irradiated rats 1 week after WBI, which then decreased significantly by the 3-month time-point. However, no difference in NGF expression was observed from 1 day to 3 months post-WBI. Overexpression of hippocampal TrkA in rats using adeno-associated virus ameliorated memory decline induced by irradiation. Additionally, upregulating TrkA expression rescued irradiation-induced hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and promoted neurogenesis. PI3K, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were also revealed to be significantly inhibited by WBI, which was ameliorated by TrkA overexpression. Findings of the present study indicated that the TrkA-dependent signaling pathway may serve a critical role in radiotherapy-induced cognitive deficit and impairments in neurogenesis.",Included
1539,"Management of small-cell lung cancer: Incremental changes but hope for the future Over 25,000 people are diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the United States annually. SCLC is a highly aggressive tumor with a propensity for early metastases and a high case-fatality rate. Systemic treatment with etoposide plus a platinum agent is recommended for all stages of this disease and has been a standard first-line therapy for SCLC since the 1980s. Three recently presented randomized clinical trials failed to show superiority of newer regimens over etoposide and cisplatin. Patients with limited-stage (LS) disease benefit from the addition of radiotherapy to systemic chemotherapy, a combination that affords high complete response rates and potential cures. Incremental improvements in radiotherapy delivery over the past decade include the use of accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radlotherapy for LS disease. Prophylactic cranial irradiation, previously recommended for patients with LS disease, has recently been shown to benefit those with extensive-stage (ES) disease as well. Surgery, largely abandoned in the 1970s, is being reevaluated as primary local therapy inpatients with very early-stage SCLC. Topotecan remains the only US Food and Drug Administration - approved therapy for recurrent disease. Amrubicin has demonstrated single-agent activity in multiple phase II trials in both chemotherapy-sensitive and -refractory relapse. The past 2 decades have been marked by an improved understanding of SCLC biology, and these discoveries are reflected in the number and diversity of novel therapies entering early-phase testing in this disease.",Excluded
2289,"Effect of space flight and head-down bedrest on neuroendocrine response to metabolic stress in physically trained subjects The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of plasma epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) responses to insulin induced hypoglycemia (ITT) 3 weeks before the space flight (SF), on the 5th day of SF, on the 2nd and 16th days after the landing in the first Slovak astronaut, and before and on the 5th day of prolonged subsequent head-down (-6 degrees) bed rest (BR) in 15 military aircraft pilots. Blood samples during the test were collected via cannula inserted into cubital vein, centrifuged in the special appliance Plasma-03, frozen in Kryogem-03, and at the end of the 8-day space flight transferred to Earth in special container for hormonal analysis. Insulin hypoglycemia was induced by i.v. administration of 0.1 IU/kg BW insulin (Actrapid HM) in bolus. Insulin administration led to a comparable hypoglycemia in pre-flight, in-flight conditions and before and after bed rest. ITT led to a pronounced increase in EPI levels and moderate increase in NE in pre-flight studies. However, an evidently reduced EPI response was found after insulin administration during SF and during BR. Thus, during the real microgravity in SF and simulated microgravity in BR, insulin-induced hypoglycemia activates the adrenomedullary system to less extent than at conditions of the Earth gravitation. Post-flight changes in EPI and NE levels did not significantly differ from those of pre-flight since SF was relatively short (8 days) and the readaptation to Earth gravitation was fast. It seems, that an increased blood flow in brain might be responsible for the reduced EPI response to insulin. Responses to ITT in physically fit subjects indicate the stimulus specificity of deconditioning effect of 5 days bed rest on stress response. Thus, the data indicate that catecholamine responses to ITT are reduced after exposure to real as well as simulated microgravity.",Excluded

Fifty (50) <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC therapies were given to 30 patients diagnosed with refractory stage IV neuroendocrine tumors (20 patients received two therapies, 10 patients received one therapy).

Amino acid coadministration for renal protection was performed. Measurements of activity in whole-body and single-photon emission computed tomography images were acquired at various time points after the administration of the radiopharmaceutical. The dosimetry for whole body, kidneys, and tumor was based on these data. The interpatient variability (the ratio of the maximum absorbed dose per injected activity for all patients) was larger than the intrapatient variability (the ratio of absorbed dose per injected activity for subsequent therapies in the same patient for whole body, kidneys, and tumor. These results imply that the first therapy could serve as a guide for future therapies.

1758,"Localization of glial aquaporin-4 and Kir4.1 in the light-injured murine retina Excessive light causes damage to photoreceptor and pigment epithelial cells, and a local edema in the outer retina. Since Muller glial cells normally mediate the osmohomeostasis in the inner retina (mainly via channel-mediated transport of potassium and water), we determined whether retinal light injury causes an alteration in the retinal localization of glial water (aquaporin-4) and potassium (Kir4.1) channels, and in the potassium conductance of Muller cells. Mice were treated with bright white light (intensity, 15,000lx) for 2h. Light treatment results in Muller cell gliosis as indicated by the enhanced staining of the glial fibrillary acidic protein and an increase in the cell membrane area reflecting cellular hypertrophy. In light-injured retinas, the immunostaining of the photoreceptor water channel aquaporin-1 disappeared along with the degeneration of the outer retina, and the outer nuclear layer contained large spherical bodies representing photoreceptor nuclei which were fused together. The immunostainings of the aquaporin-4 and Kir4.1 proteins were increased in the outer retina after light treatment. Since the amplitude of the potassium currents of Muller cells remained largely unaltered, the increase in the Kir4.1 immunostaining is supposed to be caused by a redistribution of the channel protein. The data indicate that Muller glial cells respond to excessive light with an alteration in the localization of Kir4.1 and aquaporin-4 proteins; this alteration is thought to be a response to the edema in the outer retina and may support the resolution of edema.",Excluded
2429,"Elevated DNA damage in a mouse model of oxidative stress: impacts of ionizing radiation and a protective dietary supplement Transgenic growth hormone (Tg) mice express elevated free radical processes and a progeroid syndrome of accelerated ageing. We examined bone marrow cells of Tg mice and their normal (Nr) siblings for three markers of DNA damage and assessed the impact of free radical stress using ionizing radiation. We also evaluated the radiation protection afforded by a dietary supplement that we previously demonstrated to extend longevity and reduce cognitive ageing of Nr and Tg mice. Spectral karyotyping revealed few spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in Nr or Tg. Tg mice, however, had significantly greater constitutive levels of both gammaH2AX and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) compared to Nr. When exposed to a 2-Gy whole-body dose of ionizing radiation, both Nr and Tg mice showed significant increases in DNA damage. Compared to Nr mice, irradiated Tg mice had dramatically higher levels of gammaH2AX foci and double the levels of chromosomal aberrations. In unirradiated mice, the dietary supplement significantly reduced constitutive gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in both Nr and Tg mice (normalizing both gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in Tg), with little difference in gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG over constitutive levels. Induced chromosomal aberrations were also reduced, and in Nr mice, virtually absent. Remarkably, supplemented mice expressed 6-fold lower levels of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations compared to unsupplemented Nr or Tg mice. Based on our data, the dietary supplement appeared to scavenge free radicals before they could cause damage. This study validates Tg mice as an exemplary model of oxidative stress and radiation hypersensitivity and documents unprecedented radioprotection by a dietary supplement comprised of ingredients available to the general public.",Included
1501,"In vivo imaging of human limbic responses to nitrous oxide inhalation Human behavioral studies have shown that nitrous oxide, in subanesthetic concentrations, impairs psychomotor function, cognitive performance, and learning and memory processes. However, the cerebral mechanisms of such effects remain unknown. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to map the brain areas associated with nitrous oxide effects. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in eight volunteers, during room air (control) or 20% nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide) inhalation using 15(O)-water, to reflect regional neuronal activity. To control for the possibility that 20% nitrous oxide uncoupled cerebral blood flow and metabolism, in four of the subjects, regional cerebral metabolic rate (rCMR) was also measured using 18F-deoxyglucose during the two experimental conditions. Results of rCBF and rCMR scans were compared between conditions using the statistical parametric mapping method, and areas of nitrous oxide-related activation or deactivation were identified at a significance level of 0.005. Percent changes in rCBF scan pixels from these activated or deactivated areas were then compared with those of stereotactically corresponding rCMR scan pixels with t statistics (P < 0.05 was defined as a significant difference). It was found that cerebral blood flow and metabolism were not uncoupled by 20% nitrous oxide, since percent changes in rCBF and rCMR, detected during nitrous oxide inhalation, did not differ significantly from each other (P < 0.05). Nitrous oxide inhalation was associated with significant activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a limbic area known to mediate psychomotor and cognitive processes. Deactivation was found in the posterior cingulate, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and visual association cortices in both hemispheres; the former two regions are known to mediate learning and memory. These areas identified by PET in vivo may provide the neuroanatomical basis for the behavioral responses associated with subanesthetic nitrous oxide inhalation.",Excluded

In addition to being a quick and portable screening modality and offering the added benefit of not exposing the patient to ionizing radiation, ultrasound can definitively diagnose a variety of pathologic processes of the bladder, both benign and malignant. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Briefly discuss ultrasound technique used in optimal evaluation of the bladder. Discuss normal sonographic appearance of the bladder. Illustrate and describe the imaging appearance associated with a variety of both benign and malignant bladder pathologies. Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Using ultrasound as the primary imaging modality, and with CT and MRI support, a variety of common and not so common pathologies of the bladder will be illustrated and discussed. These will include benign entities such as cystitis, calculi, bladder hernias, neurogenic bladder, ureterocele, bladder rupture and fistulization, foreign bodies, bladder endometriosis, and pseudotumors. Malignant processes such as urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and metastatic disease will also be included.

1634,"Genetic delivery of a miRNA cluster with polycistronic siRNAs reduces expression of epidermal growth receptor in human glioblastoma cells Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common malignancy of the brain, is a grade IV astrocytoma. It is one of the most rapidly growing and invasive types of glial tumors. The standard therapy includes surgical removal, radiation and chemotherapy with a median survival of about 14 months. In addition, systemic therapies are limited by the blood-brain barrier. To bypass the barrier, we are developing a gene delivery strategy to inhibit the expression of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR), which are commonly upregulated in GBM. One TKR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is overexpressed in GBM leading to uncontrolled growth and proliferation. Our approach is to recruit the RNA interference pathway. Although small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are often utilized to silence gene expression, exogenously expressed siRNAs are not an effective strategy to treat human disease due to both extracellular and intracellular nucleases as well as activation of cellular immunity against foreign nucleic acids. To bypass these degradatory mechanisms, we use a natural miRNA cluster genetic background to effectively deliver the DNA encoding multiple anti-EGFR siRNAs by inserting them into the tertiary structure of the miRNA cluster, miR-17-92. The anti-EGFR polycistronic miRNA cluster (pAAV-miR-IP1) expresses six siRNAs directed against EGFR, specifically targeting the extracellular ligand binding domain, transmembrane domain, intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and 3' untranslated region of the EGFR transcript. The vector, pAAV-miR-IP1, was transfected into the human GBM cell lines, A172 and U87MG. Results demonstrate that pAAV-miR-IP1 was expressed at high levels with a subsequent reduction in EGFR mRNA expression. Additional strategies include using the polycistronic delivery mechanism to target multiple TKRs in addition to EGFR.",Excluded
1488,"A convolutional neural network to filter artifacts in spectroscopic MRI PURPOSE: Proton MRSI is a noninvasive modality capable of generating volumetric maps of in vivo tissue metabolism without the need for ionizing radiation or injected contrast agent. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging has been shown to be a viable imaging modality for studying several neuropathologies. However, a key hurdle in the routine clinical adoption of MRSI is the presence of spectral artifacts that can arise from a number of sources, possibly leading to false information.METHODS: A deep learning model was developed that was capable of identifying and filtering out poor quality spectra. The core of the model used a tiled convolutional neural network that analyzed frequency-domain spectra to detect artifacts.RESULTS: When compared with a panel of MRS experts, our convolutional neural network achieved high sensitivity and specificity with an area under the curve of 0.95. A visualization scheme was implemented to better understand how the convolutional neural network made its judgement on single-voxel or multivoxel MRSI, and the convolutional neural network was embedded into a pipeline capable of producing whole-brain spectroscopic MRI volumes in real time.CONCLUSION: The fully automated method for assessment of spectral quality provides a valuable tool to support clinical MRSI or spectroscopic MRI studies for use in fields such as adaptive radiation therapy planning.",Excluded
1626,"Synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held under in vivo like activity levels One of the hallmarks of auditory neurons in vivo is spontaneous activity that occurs even in the absence of any sensory stimuli. Sound-evoked bursts of discharges are thus embedded within this background of random firing. The calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) has been characterized in vitro as a fast relay that reliably fires at high stimulus frequencies (< or =800 Hz). However, inherently due to the preparation method, spontaneous activity is absent in studies using brain stem slices. Here we first determine in vivo spontaneous firing rates of MNTB principal cells from Mongolian gerbils and then reintroduce this random firing to in vitro gerbil brain stem synapses at near-physiological temperature. After conditioning synapses with afferent fiber stimulation for 2 min at Poisson averaged rates of 20, 40, and 60 Hz, we observed a number of differences in the properties of synaptic transmission between conditioned and unconditioned synapses. Foremost, we observed reduced steady-state EPSC amplitudes that depressed even further during an embedded short-stimulation train of 100, 300, or 600 Hz (a protocol that thus simulates in vitro what probably occurs at the in vivo MNTB after a short sound stimulus in a silent background). Accordingly, current-clamp, dynamic-clamp, and loose-patch recordings revealed a number of action potential failures at the postsynaptic cell during high-frequency-stimulation trains, although the initial onset of evoked activity was still transmitted with higher fidelity. We thus propose that some in vivo auditory synapses are in a tonic state of reduced EPSC amplitudes as a consequence of high spontaneous spiking and this in vivo-like conditioning has important consequences for the encoding of signals throughout the auditory pathway.",Excluded

Methods : A retrospective study was conducted on 320 patients (median age 56 years, range 24-87 years) who underwent primary Gamma Knife radiosurgery for asymptomatic meningiomas between 1998 and 2012. The median tumor volume was 2.7 cc (range 0.2-10.5 cc) and the median follow-up was 48 months (range 24-168 months). Volumetric data sets for tumors and PTE on serial MRIs were analyzed. The edema index (EI) was defined as the ratio of the volume of PTE including tumor to the tumor volume, and the relative edema indices (rEIs) were calculated from serial EIs normalized against the baseline EI. Risk factors for PTE were analyzed using logistic regression. Results : Newly developed or increased PTE was noted in 49 patients (15.3%), among whom it was symptomatic in 28 patients (8.8%). Tumor volume larger than 4.2 cc (p<0.001), hemispheric tumor location (p=0.005), and pre-treatment PTE (p<0.001) were associated with an increased risk of PTE. rEI reached its maximum value at 11 months after SRS and decreased thereafter, and symptoms resolved within 24 months in most patients (85.7%). Conclusion : Caution should be exercised in decision-making on SRS for asymptomatic meningiomas of large volume (>4.2 cc), of hemispheric location, or with pre-treatment PTE. PTE usually develops within months, reaches its maximum degree until a year, and resolves within 2 years after SRS. Copyright © 2015 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded
1727,"Wavelength-dependent change of retinal nerve fiber layer reflectance in glaucomatous retinas PURPOSE: Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) reflectance is often used in optical methods for RNFL assessment in clinical diagnosis of glaucoma, yet little is known about the reflectance property of the RNFL under the development of glaucoma. This study measured the changes in RNFL reflectance spectra that occurred in retinal nerve fiber bundles with different degrees of glaucomatous damage.METHODS: A rat model of glaucoma with laser photocoagulation of trabecular meshwork was used. Reflectance of the RNFL in an isolated retina was measured at wavelengths of 400-830 nm. Cytostructural distribution of the bundles measured optically was evaluated by confocal imaging of immunohistochemistry staining of cytoskeletal components, F-actin, microtubules, and neurofilaments. RNFL reflectance spectra were studied in bundles with normal-looking appearance, early F-actin distortion, and apparent damage of all cytoskeletal components. Changes of RNFL reflectance spectra were studied at different radii (0.22, 0.33, and 0.44 mm) from the optic nerve head (ONH).RESULTS: Bundles in 30 control retinas and 41 glaucomatous retinas were examined. In normal retinas, reflectance spectra were similar along the same bundles. In glaucomatous retinas, reflectance spectra changed along bundles with the spectra becoming flatter as bundle areas approached the ONH.CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) causes nonuniform changes in RNFL reflectance across wavelengths. Changes of reflectance spectra occur early in bundles near the ONH and prior to apparent cytoskeletal distortion. Using the ratio of RNFL reflectance measured at different wavelengths can provide early and sensitive detection of glaucomatous damage.",Excluded

Eighty 12-14-week-old young adult male Fischer 344 rats received either: (1) sham irradiation, (2) 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation delivered as two 5 Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks, (3) sham irradiation plus continuous administration of 15 mg/L of ramipril in the drinking water starting 3 days before irradiation, or (4) fractionated whole-brain irradiation plus ramipril. Cognitive function was assessed using a perirhinal cortex-dependent version of the novel object recognition task 26 weeks after irradiation. Microglial activation was determined in the perirhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus 28 weeks after irradiation using the ED1 antibody. Neurogenesis was assessed in the granular cell layer and subgranular zones of the dentate gyrus using a doublecortin antibody. Fractionated whole-brain irradiation led to: (1) a significant impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, (2) a significant increase in activated microglia in the dentate gyrus but not in the perirhinal cortex, and (3) a significant decrease in neurogenesis. Continuous administration of ramipril before, during, and after irradiation prevented the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced changes in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, as well as in microglial activation in the dentate gyrus. Thus, as hypothesized, continuous administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, can prevent the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function.",Included
1668,"Hippocampal sparing radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients: a planning study using volumetric modulated arc therapy BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to reduce exposure of the contralateral hippocampus in radiotherapy for glioblastoma using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).METHODS: Datasets of 27 patients who had received 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for glioblastoma with a prescribed dose of 60Gy in fractions of 2Gy were included in this planning study. VMAT plans were optimized with the aim to reduce the dose to the contralateral hippocampus as much as possible without compromising other parameters. Hippocampal dose and treatment parameters were compared to the 3D-CRT plans using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The influence of tumour location and PTV size on the hippocampal dose was investigated with the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.RESULTS: The median reduction of the contralateral hippocampus generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) with VMAT was 36 % compared to the original 3D-CRT plans (p < 0.05). Other dose parameters were maintained or improved. The median V30Gy brain could be reduced by 17.9 % (p < 0.05). For VMAT, a parietal and a non-temporal tumour localisation as well as a larger PTV size were predictors for a higher hippocampal dose (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Using VMAT, a substantial reduction of the radiotherapy dose to the contralateral hippocampus for patients with glioblastoma is feasible without compromising other treatment parameters. For larger PTV sizes, less sparing can be achieved. Whether this approach is able to preserve the neurocognitive status without compromising the oncological outcome needs to be investigated in the setting of prospective clinical trials.",Excluded
2217,"Proton radiation therapy for retinoblastoma: Comparison of various intraocular tumor locations and beam arrangements To study the optimization of proton beam arrangements for various intraocular tumor locations; and to correlate isodose distributions with various target and nontarget structures. We considered posterior-central, nasal, and temporal tumor locations, with straight, intrarotated, or extrarotated eye positions. Doses of 46 cobalt grey equivalent (CGE) to gross tumor volume (GTV) and 40 CGE to clinical target volume (CTV) (2 CGE per fraction) were assumed. Using three-dimensional planning, we compared isodose distributions for lateral, anterolateral oblique, and anteromedial oblique beams and dose-volume histograms of CTVs, GTVs, lens, lacrimal gland, bony orbit, and soft tissues. All beam arrangements fully covered GTVs and CTVs with optimal lens sparing. Only 15% of orbital bone received doses <20 CGE with a lateral beam, with 20-26 CGE delivered to two of three growth centers. The anterolateral oblique approach with an intrarotated eye resulted in additional reduction of bony volume and exposure of only one growth center. No appreciable dose was delivered to the contralateral eye, brain tissue, or pituitary gland. Proton therapy achieved homogeneous target coverage with true lens sparing. Doses to orbit structures, including bony growth centers, were minimized with different beam arrangements and eye positions. Proton therapy could reduce the risks of second malignancy and cosmetic and functional sequelae. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

We analyzed demography, treatment and survival outcome data of 56 patients of ODG registered in our institute from 2000 to 2013. Method(s): All patients (Pts) underwent maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant RT 60 Gy in 30 fractions. After 2004, pts underwent chemoradiation with daily Temozolomide TMZ) (75 mg/m2) and maintenance TMZ (150-200 mg/m2 D1-D5) for a total of six cycles. An event was described as death for overall survival, progression/ recurrence of disease, or neuro-deterioration for progression free survival. Log-rank test was used to compare event-free survival (EFS) distribution. Result(s): Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (range-19-77). 39 patients were male and 17 patients were female with a male: female ratio of 2.3:1. Headache was the commonest symptom seen in 56.4% patients followed by seizures (53.8%) and motor deficit (12.8%).Median duration of symptoms was 8.5 months. Frontal location was most common in 66% of the patients followed by temporal and parietal location (12.5% each). 46(82.1%) patients had pure anaplastic ODG histology while 10(17.9%) patients had mixed anaplastic oligodendroglial tumor. 29(51.8%) patients underwent a gross total excision while others underwent a subtotal resection or a biopsy only. All patients except one underwent adjuvant RT with a median dose of 60 Gy (range 40-60 Gy). 38(67.9%) patients had recieved concurrent chemotherapy and 31(55.4%) patients also recieved adjuvant chemotherapy. The median number of adjuvant cycles was 6. The estimated 5 year overall survival was 83.5%.The median progression free survival (PFS) was 5.2 years and the 5 year PFS was 55.1%. Age, sex, extend of surgery, use of chemotherapy, tumor location were not found to be significant factors affecting PFS on univariate analysis. Conclusion(s): The use of adjuvant RT and chemotherapy in patients with anaplastic ODG is associated with a good 5 year OS of 83.5% and a 5 year PFS of 55.1%.

1888,"Electrohypersensitivity: state-of-the-art of a functional impairment Recently, a new category of persons, claiming to suffer from exposure to electromagnetic fields, has been described in the literature. In Sweden, electrohypersensitivity (EHS) is an officially fully recognized functional impairment (i.e., it is not regarded as a disease). Survey studies show that somewhere between 230,000-290,000 Swedish men and women report a variety of symptoms when being in contact with electromagnetic field (EMF) sources. The aim of our studies has been to investigate possible alterations, in the cellular and neuronal systems of these person' skin. As controls, age- and sex-matched persons, without any subjective or clinical symptoms or dermatological history, served. Immunohistochemistry using antisera to the previously characterized marker substances of interest has been utilized. In summary, it is evident from our preliminary data that various alterations are present in the electrohypersensitive person' skin. In view of recent epidemiological studies, pointing to a correlation between long-term exposure from power-frequent magnetic fields or microwaves and cancer, our data ought to be taken seriously and further analyzed.

Method(s): The criteria for inclusion in this study were as follows: (1) previously untreated maxillary sinus cancer; (2) squamous cell carcinoma; (3) T4 disease; and (4) curative-intent treatment. The data for 118 patients were obtained from 28 institutions across Japan and analyzed for overall survival and local control rates by local extension site. Result(s): Sites with a poor prognosis included the cribriform plate, dura, nasopharynx, middle cranial fossa, and cranial nerves other than V2. There was a significant correlation among these sites, except for the cranial nerves. Additionally, the hard palate was the only site that correlated with nodal involvement and showed a poor treatment outcome.

1732,"Update on small cell lung cancer management Small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) account for,15-20% of all lung cancers. Because SCLC is almost always associated with long-term tobacco smoking, abstinence from smoking and smoking cessation are crucial for primary prevention. Because symptoms are generally unspecific, the disease is often diagnosed late, with 70% of patients already in stage IIIb or IV at the time of diagnosis. Early detection of SCLC through screening is under investigation. Chemotherapy, generally a platinum-based combination, is the mainstay of therapy and is generally combined with radiation in the first-line treatment of tumours up to stage IIIb. Surgery has a place in the diagnosis and therapy of stage I SCLC, but plays no key role in advanced cancer. In patients who respond to first-line therapy, prophylactic cranial irradiation can prevent brain metastases and improve overall survival. Although the initial response to treatment is usually good, SCLC tends to relapse quickly. This makes second-line therapy quite important. Topotecan is the most studied and widely used agent in second-line therapy; however, newer agents, including biological therapies, are under study.",Excluded
1743,"Effect of proton pump inhibitors in hospitalization on mortality of patients with hepatic encephalopathy and cirrhosis but no active gastrointestinal bleeding BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric complication of decompensated cirrhosis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), used as potent acid suppressants, are associated with HE occurrence in cirrhotic patients. However, it is still unknown if PPIs contribute to mortality in cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastrointestinal bleeding.METHODS: We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database to identify 1004 cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastric bleeding, who received oral PPIs between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. On the basis of comorbid disorder data, we used propensity score matching at a 1:4 ratio to select 4016 cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastric bleeding who did not receive PPIs as a comparison group. All patients were followed up for one year from the index time.RESULTS: The overall 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities were 36.1%, 52.6%, and 70.1% in PPI group, and 27.5%, 41.7%, and 62.4% in non-PPI group. Using Cox regression model analysis with adjustment for age, gender, and other comorbid disorders, we obtained hazard ratios of 1.360 (95% CI: 1.208-1.532, P<0.001), 1.563 (95% CI: 1.314-1.859; P<0.001), and 1.187 (95% CI: 1.008-1.398; P=0.040) for, respectively, 30-day, 30-day to 90-day, and 90-day to 1-year mortality in patients taking PPIs.CONCLUSION: PPIs increase short-term and long-term mortality of cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastrointestinal bleeding.",Excluded
2194,"Modulation of rod photoreceptor potassium Kx current by divalent cations Similarities between photoreceptor Kx channels and EAG and KCNQ channels suggest that the Kx channel may be related to one or both of these families of potassium channels. To provide a basis for further comparison of these channels, as well as to reveal the role of zinc (endogenously present in photoreceptors) in Kx channel modulation, we studied the effects of divalent cations on activation and kinetic properties of the noninactivating potassium current, I(Kx), in salamander rod photoreceptors. We found that divalent cations slowed the activation of I(Kx) and shifted its activation curve to positive potentials, effects attributable to surface charge screening. The effect of zinc on I(Kx) kinetics was considerably stronger than that expected from the activation curve shift alone. None of the divalent ions studied changed the monoexponential nature of I(Kx) activation. A simple model of a rod photoreceptor was created using NEURON software. In the model, zinc accelerated and sharpened the light response, broadening the frequency response of rod photoreceptors. Our results show that although the overall effects of divalent cations are in part due to surface charge screening effects, zinc also induced a specific change in I(Kx) activation kinetics, and this action profoundly alters rod response properties.",Excluded
2111,"One-step Minimally Invasive Pedicle Screw Instrumentation Using O-Arm and Stealth Navigation STUDY DESIGN: Description of a navigated, single-step, minimally invasive technique for the placement of pedicle screws.OBJECTIVE: To describe a new technique for minimally invasive placement of pedicle screws in the lumbar spine using O-arm and StealthStation navigation in combination.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive surgical techniques are described in the literature as safe and effective methods for pedicle screw instrumentation. These techniques increase radiation exposure and prompt multiple instrument passes through the pedicle.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 35 adult patients (187 screws) underwent lumbar surgery with pedicle screw placement using the 1- (8 patients/48 screws) or 2-step (27 patients/139 screws) technique. Complications associated with instrumentation were noted. Pedicle screw position was evaluated.RESULTS: Of 187 screws placed, 181 (96.8%) were found to be fully contained within the pedicle (grade 1) and 4 (2.1%) had a breach of <2 mm. In the 1-step technique, no screws were malpositioned. One screw at S1 with inadequate fixation was replaced with a screw 1 mm larger in diameter. In the 2-step technique, 2 screws (1.06% overall) were revised due to inferior breach of the pedicle. No neurological sequelae were noted. Also, 1 screw was deemed too long at S1 and was replaced with a shorter screw. None of the revised pedicle screws caused neuromonitoring changes and the breaches were found intraoperatively on 3D imaging.CONCLUSIONS: Using O-arm and StealthStation navigation with minimally invasive surgical technology for placement of posterior spinal instrumentation is safe, effective, and limits radiation exposure.",Excluded
1492,"Changes in the vestibular function during space flight An analysis of observations and investigations carried out in space flight has shown that some cosmonauts and astronauts have experienced vestibular disorders during the transition to weightlessness. Vestibular-sensory disorders include: Spatial illusions (the feelings of falling down, being in an upside-down position, the sensations of rotation of the craft or the body) and vertigo occurring during the onset of the orbital flight and head movements; Feelings, similar to those experienced in response to Coriolis accelerations on the Earth, which occasionally develop in weightlessness during the spacecraft rotation upon abrupt head and body movements and restrained feet; Feelings ""of the load on the vestibular analyser which is unlike any Earth-bound effects"" upon abrupt head movements during the first hours of an orbital flight and ""a prolonged movement"" during the switch-off of thrusters in weightlessness. Vestibular-vegetative disorders comprise a complex of symptoms similar to those of motion sickness: loss of appetite, stomach awareness (12%), hypersalination, nausea (9.6%) and vomiting (4.8%). Soviet studies suggest that the vestibular tolerance to the flight effects depends on the natural stability and training to the cumulative effect of adequate vestibular stimuli. This has been used in the development of the system of vestibular selection. Changes in the vestibular function seem to play the major role in the development of motion sickness in weightlessness, extra-labyrinthine factors being contributory. The current hypotheses have not yet been adequately confirmed in experiments. A detailed physiological analysis allows the conclusion that the decisive factor in the development of motion sickness may be the disturbance of the function of analysers responsible for spatial orientation which take the form of sensory conflicts as well as an altered reactivity of the organism due to the hemodynamic rearrangement.

We retrospectively reviewed our experience of repeat WBRT in an era where stereotactic radiosurgery was also available.METHODS: In our IRB-approved database, 49 patients received repeat WBRT from 1996 to 2011. Median initial dose of WBRT was 30 Gy in 10 fractions (range, 27 to 37.5 Gy); median reirradiation dose was 20 Gy in 10 fractions (range, 14 to 30 Gy). Median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) at reirradiation was 70 (range, 40 to 90). Median number of discrete lesions at reirradiation was 6 (range, 1 to 30). Median interval between initial diagnosis of brain metastases and relapse requiring repeat WBRT was 11.5 months (range, 1.5 to 49.2 mo). Overall survival and relapse-free survival were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare outcomes between groups.RESULTS: Ninety percent of patients completed repeat WBRT. Median survival after repeat WBRT was 3 months (95% CI, 1.9-4.0). Thirteen patients had improved neurological symptoms (27%), 12 were stable (24%), and 14 had worsening symptoms (29%). On radiographic follow-up of 22 patients, 10 (46%) were improved, 4 (18%) were stable, and 8 (36%) progressed. Improved neurological symptoms after repeat WBRT and higher KPS at first follow-up were associated with improved survival (P=0.05 and 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: Repeat WBRT was well tolerated. Modest survival times are seen. Prognostic factors for survival include improved neurological symptoms after repeat WBRT and higher KPS at first follow-up. Repeat WBRT may be useful to improve neurological symptoms in patients with limited treatment options, especially those who are not appropriate stereotactic radiosurgery candidates.",Excluded
2329,"Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation over the human motor cortex on corticospinal and transcallosal excitability Weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can induce long lasting changes in cortical excitability. In the present study we asked whether tDCS applied to the left primary motor cortex (M1) also produces aftereffects distant from the site of the stimulating electrodes. We therefore tested corticospinal excitability in the left and the right M1 and transcallosal excitability between the two cortices using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after applying tDCS. Eight healthy subjects received 10 min of anodal or cathodal tDCS (1 mA) to the left M1. We examined the amplitude of contralateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and the onset latency and duration of transcallosal inhibition with single pulse TMS. MEPs evoked from the tDCS stimulated (left) M1 were increased by 32% after anodal and decreased by 27% after cathodal tDCS, while transcallosal inhibition evoked from the left M1 remained unchanged. The effect on MEPs evoked from the left M1 lasted longer for cathodal than for anodal tDCS. MEPs evoked from the right M1 were unchanged whilst the duration of transcallosal inhibition evoked from the right M1 was shortened after cathodal tDCS and prolonged after anodal tDCS. The duration of transcallosal inhibition returned to control values before the effect on the MEPs from the left M1 had recovered. These findings are compatible with the idea that tDCS-induced aftereffects in the cortical motor system are limited to the stimulated hemisphere, and that tDCS not only affects corticospinal circuits involved in producing MEPs but also inhibitory interneurons mediating transcallosal inhibition from the contralateral hemisphere.",Excluded
2202,"Invasive tracheal metastasis: Fatal complication of stereotactic body radiation therapy Introduction: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an important and increasing public health threat in the developed world. In the US 17 % of patients diagnosed with de novo RCC present with metastatic disease most often to lung (50-60%), bone (30-40%), liver (20%) and brain (5-11%). No treatment is effective for majority of patients with systemic disease; median survival time of those with metastatic disease is 6-12 months with a 2-year survival rate of 10-20%<sup>1</sup>. Stereotactic body high-dose fraction radiation therapy (SBRT) has shown a high local control rate however it is not without complications. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66 year old male with medical history of RCC clear cell type s/p left nephrectomy in 2007 with metastasis to bone presented to clinic with persistent cough and submassive hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy revealed tracheal mass nearly obstructing the tracheal lumen 1 cm proximal to main carina. Endobronchial biopsy, cytology brush, and bronchoalveolar lavage were all negative for malignant cells. PET/CT showed avidity with SUV 5.0 in distal trachea. Multidisciplinary discussion occurred and decision was made to proceed with SBRT for presumptive metastatic renal cell carcinoma with tracheal invasion. Patient completed 5000 cGy radiation in 5 equal fractions with improvement in symptoms. Repeat bronchoscopy 4 months after SBRT therapy revealed necrotic tracheal tissue with concern of mediastinitis. Hospitalization 5 months after SBRT was due to recurrence of submassive hemoptysis. Repeat CT chest revealed acute mediastinitis with aortic ulceration of ascending aorta. Patient also reported expectorating pieces of thick tissue found to be remnants of tracheal cartilage. Rapid decline in hemodynamic status ensued and patient subsequently exsanguinated from ultimate aortic perforation. DISCUSSION: Without definitive therapy this patient would almost certainly have died of metastatic carcinoma to trachea. The patient could also die from aggressive treatment in context of treatment-related complications affecting lung parenchyma and adjacent vasculature. Conclusion(s): SBRT continuously evolves and is at the precipice of the technological advancements in image guidance, dosimetric parameters, and radiation delivery to direct radiation ablation doses to tumors. Careful evaluation and management of patients in multidisciplinary clinical setting, as well as a very thorough informed consent process are essential to ensuring the best possible treatment and outcome.",Excluded
1776,"Effect of exposure to radio frequency radiation emitted by cell phone on the developing dorsal root ganglion of chick embryo: a light microscopic study With an ever increasing number of cell phone users since late twenty first century, magnitude of the problem of exposure to radiation emitted by cell phone is self evident. Extensive research had been devoted to incriminate or absolve it as a health hazard. Radiofrequency radiation emitted by cell phone had been stated to be a potent carcinogen, cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic and neurobehavioral teratogen. Its effect on the brain had been a subject of extensive research evidently due to its proximity to the user's brain. While considering the biological effects of radiofrequency radiation, its intensity, frequency and the duration of exposure are important determinants. Nevertheless the results of these different studies have not been unequivocal. Considering the contradictory reports, the present work was undertaken to study the effect of such an exposure on the developing neural tissue of chick embryo. The processes of cell division and differentiation are fundamental to the development of any living being and are a sensitive index of any insult sustained at this stage. Neurons of dorsal root ganglion were selected for the present study as these ganglia were fully differentiated as early as fourth day of embryonic life. By varying duration of exposure, the embryos were exposed to different doses of radiation, sacrificed at different periods of incubation and subjected to histological processing. On light microscopic study it was observed that developing neurons of dorsal root ganglion suffered a damage which was dose dependent and persisted in spite of giving the exposure-free period between two exposures.",Excluded

Method(s): Fifty-five RE patients and 54 healthy age-matched subjects were enrolled in this retrospective cross-sectional case-control study. The best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) of the included eye should not be more than 0. The vessel density and thickness of different locations in the retina were acquired automatically using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The data were then compared between the RE patients and the controls. The location included the whole retina, the superficial vascular plexus (SVP)/the ganglion cell complex (GCC), the deep vascular plexus (DVP), and the choroid in the macular area, as well as the inside disc and peripapillary area in the optic nerve head (ONH). The risk factors in OCTA retinal impairments were analyzed using a backward multiple linear regression. The relationships between mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) in the visual field (VF) and the OCTA parameters were also analyzed in RE patients. Result(s): The vessel density of the GCC was significantly reduced in RE patients compared with controls (p = 0.018), and the reductions were mainly shown in the parafoveal (p = 0.049) and perifoveal fields (p = 0.006). The thickness of the GCC was correspondingly reduced (whole image GCC mean thickness: p = 0.044; parafoveal thickness: p = 0.038; perifoveal thickness: p = 0.038). In addition, the sub-foveal choroidal thickness (p = 0.039) was also reduced in RE patients.

The vessel density of the GCC also had a significant negative correlation with apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (beta = -32.18, p = 0.006). In the VF, MD had a significant positive correlation with the vessel density inside disc (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.241, beta = 0.304, p = 0.045), whereas PSD showed a significant negative correlation with the vessel density inside disc and the average GCC thickness, respectively (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.437; vessel density inside disc, beta = -0.358, p = 0.004; average GCC thickness, beta = -0.510, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): With the aid of OCTA, we found that neurovascular alterations of the retina may exist in RE patients with normal-ranged visual acuity. Herein, we suggest the implementation of OCTA to assist ophthalmologists in the early detection and consistent monitoring of radiation-related eye diseases to avoid delayed diagnosis. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Zhan, Xiao and Lan.",Included

The series included 24 lesions (28 treatments). The median age of the patients was 60 years (range, 24-85 years). Forty-four percent of the tumors were located in the mobile spine, 39% inside the cranium, and 17% in the sacral region. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1. The mean tumor volume was 128.0 mL (range, 12.0-457.3 mL), and the median dose of 35 Gy (range, 24.0-40.0 Gy) was delivered in 5 sessions. The median follow-up period was 46 months (range, 7-65 months).RESULTS: There were 3 significant complications in patients with previous irradiation, including infection in the surgical/radiation site (2 patients) and decreased vision (1 patient). Improvement in pain and quality of life did not reach statistical significance (alpha = 0.05). Seven patients experienced recurrence at a median of 10 months (range, 5-38 months), and 4 patients with disseminated disease died 7 to 48 months after therapy. Two patients had a partial response, whereas 9 others had stable disease. The local control rate at 65 months was 59.1%, with an overall survival of 74.3% and disease-specific survival of 88.9%. We estimated an alpha/beta ratio of 2.45 for chordomas, which supports hypofractionation.CONCLUSION: The CK/SRS safety and efficacy profile compares favorably with those of other treatment delivery systems. CK/SRS appears to reduce tumor volume, given an adequate dose. The authors recommend treatment with 40 Gy in 5 sessions to the clinical treatment volume, which includes the gross tumor volume and at least a 1-cm margin.",Excluded

A dose of 100 rad gamma irradiation blocked a proportion of normal and HD cells in G1. A higher radiation dose applied to normal cells increased the number of cells blocked in G1 and significantly delayed cells which were in S at the time of irradiation from reaching G2 DNA content. The reduced cumulative mitotic index in irradiated cultures of normal cells 2 h after irradiation suggests that cells in G2 at the time of irradiation are delayed before entering mitosis. After irradiation HD cells responded similarly to normal cells except that a greater proportion of HD cells were blocked in G1. AT cells do not show the normal delay in progression from G1 to S, or from S to G2 in the first cycle after irradiation. The cumulative mitotic index was reduced in irradiated cells, implying that they are delayed in G2. Thus AT cells did not recognize or respond to signals from damaged DNA which in normal and HD cells caused a proportional block in G1 and an S-phase delay. The only point of arrest in cell-cycle progression in irradiated AT cells was in G2.",Excluded

CASE: A 56-year-old Caucasian female who is a practicing minister started behaving unusually during one of her services. She began walking up to the alter at inappropriate times and her family was concerned about her behavior. This change in mentation continued into the next day and the decision was made to bring her to the hospital. The patient had a history of superficial malignant melanoma to the left axilla, which was treated with axillary dissection 13 years ago. Sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time was negative and the patient did not receive any further chemotherapy or radiation. She was monitored for 5 years with serial PET scans every 6 months along with chest Xrays, routine blood work and annual skin exams without evidence of disease recurrence. On this presentation, the patient had multiple episodes of tonicclonic seizures while in the ED for which she was given Ativan, Versed and IV Keppra. The patient denied previous CNS symptoms including headache, seizures, or vision changes. Imaging of the head revealed a large hemorrhagic frontal temporal brain lesion with smaller scattered lesions concerning for metastatic disease. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a 2.2 x 1.6 cm peripancreatic tail mass. An endoscopic ultrasound was performed which showed a mass in the region of the tail of the pancreas. FNA was done with pathology positive for metastatic melanoma. Patient was referred to Oncology service for further management. IMPACT: Most pancreatic metastases occur in the first 1-3 years after treatment of the primary tumor and current guidelines recommend follow up 3-5 years thereafter. This case report raises a question about how long patient should be monitored after the successful treatment of superficial malignant melanoma. DISCUSSION: A variety of primary neoplasms metastasize to the pancreas. About 2% of pancreatic tumors are metastatic tumors. Common metastatic sites include the kidney, lung and colon. Metastasis of malignant melanoma to pancreas occurs as manifestation of widespread disease burden. Several factors influence survival in patients with primary melanoma, including specific clinical and pathological factors, histological subtype, anatomical location and lymph node involvement. Prognostic factors influencing survival in patients with malignant melanoma are largely unknown, but a longer disease free interval between the successful resection of primary malignancy and eventual development of metastasis to the pancreas has been reported to be associated with improved survival. Our patient presented 13 years following the treatment of primarymelanoma. The prognosis of metastatic malignant melanoma is poor. Studies suggest amean survival of only 6- 8 months in patients with systemic disease from melanoma. In several case series five-year survival rates are reported at less than 10%.",Excluded

Although Atm can regulate p53, it is not known if this Atm function varies between tissues. Previous studies showed that the induction of p53 and apoptosis by whole-body ionizing radiation varies greatly between tissue and tumor types, so here we asked if Atm also had a tissue-specific role in the ionizing radiation response. Irradiated Atm-null mice showed impaired p53 induction and apoptosis in thymus, spleen, and brain. In contrast, radiation-induced p53, apoptosis, phosphorylation of Chk2, and G(2)-M cell cycle arrest were slightly delayed in Atm(-/-) epithelial cells of the small intestine but reached wild-type levels by 4 h. Radiation-induced p53 and apoptosis in Atm(-/-) hair follicle epithelial cells were not impaired at any of the time points examined. Thus, Atm is essential for radiation-induced apoptosis in lymphoid tissues but is largely dispensable in epithelial cells. This indicates that marked differences in DNA damage signaling pathways exist between tissues, which could explain some of the tissue-specific phenotypes, especially tumor suppression, associated with Atm deficiency.",Excluded
2257,"ANG1005 in leptomeningeal disease (ANGLeD) trial: A randomized, open-label, phase 3 study of ANG1005 compared with Physician's Best Choice in HER2-negative breast cancer patients with newly diagnosed leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and previously treated brain metastases Background: Annually, more than 4,000 patients are diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) from breast cancer in the U.S. Since most therapies cannot cross the Blood-CSF-Barrier (BCB) and the Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB), treatment options for LC are limited to local radiation and few chemotherapy agents, none of which have provided durable clinical benefit, leading to short overall survival (OS) of 3-4 months. ANG1005 is a novel peptide-drug conjugate, consisting of 3 paclitaxel molecules covalently linked to a peptide that targets the LRP-1 receptor to cross both BCB and BBB, and enter the tumor cells, where the paclitaxel is cleaved off to exert its anti-tumor activity. ANG1005 has previously shown in a phase 2 study to prolong OS in LC patients from breast cancer with brain metastases (BM) to 8 months. Trial Design: This is an open-label, multi-center phase 3 randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of ANG1005 in HER2-negative breast cancer patients with newly diagnosed LC and documented history of previously treated BM when compared to Physician Best Choice (PBC). Hundred and fifty (150) patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either ANG1005 experimental treatment or an Investigator assigned PBCcontrol treatment. ANG1005 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at a starting dose of 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks. Allowed PBC therapies include capecitabine, eribulin, or high-dose IV methotrexate. CNS disease (LC and BM) will be evaluated at screening and every 6 weeks by MRI, CSF cytology and neurological assessments according to LANO and RANO-BM criteria. Extracranial disease will be evaluated by CT scans according to RECIST at screening and every 6-12 weeks. All patients will be foliowed for survival every 6-8 weeks from the date of the last dose until death, lost to follow-up or consent withdrawal. Eligibility Criteria: Eligible patients are adults (E 18 years old) with HER2-negative breast cancer, newly diagnosed LC and documented history of previously treated BM. Patients must be neurologically stable and have adequate blood counts, organ and bone marrow function with an ECOG status grade 2. Patients previously treated with ANG1005 or with known allergy to paclitaxel or its components are excluded. Specific aims: The primary endpoint is OS. Secondary endpoints include CNS (LC and BM) progression-free survival and clinical benefit rate, 6-and 12-month OS rates, LC response rate and duration of response, OS for triple negative patients and safety. Statistical Methods: This study is sized for testing the hypothesis of improved OS for ANG1005 versus PBC in all patients (HR=0.58, two-sided test, overall type 1 error of 5%). Interim analysis for OS (using O'Brien Fleming boundaries for efficacy and a fixed HR=1 for futility) will be performed when a total of 55 death events are reached across both arms.

1425,"Dose response study of human exposure to 60 Hz electric and magnetic fields This human exposure study examined the relationship between field strength and biological response and tested whether the exposure levels at which the greatest effects occur differ for different endpoints. Three matched groups of 18 men each participated in two 6 h exposure test sessions. All subjects were sham exposed in one session. In the other session, each group of subjects was exposed at a different level of combined electric and magnetic field strength (low group:6 kV/m, 10 microT; medium group:9 kV/m, 20 microT; and high group: 12 kV/m, 30 microT). The study was performed double blind, with exposure order counterbalanced. Significant slowing of heart rate, as well as alternations in the latency and amplitude of event-related brain potential measures derived from the electro encephalogram (EEG), occurred in the group exposed to the 9 kV/m, 20 microT combined field (medium group). Exposure at the other field strength levels had no influence on cardiac measures and differential effects on EEG activity. Significant decrements in reaction time and in performance accuracy on a time estimation task were observed only in the low group. These results provide support for the hypothesis that humans may be more responsive to some combinations or levels of field strength than to others and that such differences in responsivity may depend, in part, on the endpoint of interest.",Excluded

1644,"Patient-reported outcomes after chest radiation for hodgkin (HL) and non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) Purpose/Objective(s): Multimodality treatment results in excellent outcomes for many patients with HL and NHL; however, these survivor populations are at risk for late effects. Here, we describe patient reported outcomes after chest radiation, a treatment recognized to be associated with late effects. Materials/Methods: Patient-reported data were gathered via convenience sample frame from HL/ NHL survivors voluntarily using an Internet tool for creation of survivorship care plans. The tool requires entry of data regarding diagnosis, demographics, and treatments, and provides customized guidelines for future care. It is publically available and free, having >30,0000 total users since 2007. During use of the tool, survivors are queried regarding experience with late effects associated with specific treatments. Result(s): Of 7912 survivors using the most current version of the tool (2011-2014), 9% (710) were HL or NHL survivors (32% and 68%, respectively). Of these, 61% were female, 81% Caucasian, 88% US residents, with median diagnosis age 29y (R18-51) for HL survivors and 52y (R18-91) for NHL, and median fu 9y and 4 y, respectively. Per report, 11% had previous survivorship information and 20% had received a treatment summary; current healthcare being provided by an oncologist only for 47%, PCP only for 13%, both for 36%, and neither for 3%. Chemotherapy was delivered to 89% of HL and 91% of NHL survivors, and radiation to 66% and 29%, respectively. Of those receiving radiation, 78% HL and 76% NHL survivors received chest/mantle RT (n = 246). When users were queried regarding outcomes, 86% reported being free of cancer, 10% with recurrent or secondary malignancy, and 4% with metastatic disease. Patients who had received chest RT reported: hyper or hypothyroidism (25%), thyroid nodules (10%), speaking/swallowing changes (19%), heart disease (15%), pulmonary fibrosis or pneumonitis (8%), and skin cancers within the radiation field (6%). Six of 246 reported secondary breast cancers (2%), compared to zero in the group not receiving chest RT, with median time to breast cancer 11.5y (R 1-32y). Receipt of chemotherapy was associated with: Chronic fatigue (46%), perceived cognitive change (43%), peripheral neuropathy (28%), sexual change (13% of male users, 27% of female), osteoporosis (13%) and heart disease (5%). Conclusion(s): Survivors of HL and NHL remain at significant risk for late effects, despite excellent disease outcomes overall. Radiation to the chest appears significantly associated with patient-reported late effects including thyroid, heart, and lung disease, although more survivors report problematic fatigue, cognitive changes, neuropathies, and sexual changes after chemotherapy. These data indicate need for improved survivor support both for known radiation late effects, and for other negative outcomes that may be subtle to clinicians, but significantly impact quality of life.",Excluded
1204,"Lipid bilayer and water proton magnetization transfer: effect of cholesterol Magnetization transfer between macromolecules and water can be a significant factor contributing to tissue water 1H relaxation. Using saturation transfer techniques, the degree of magnetization transfer between the macromolecular matrix and bulk water 1H can be directly measured and magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) can be generated in MR images. A significant degree of MTC has been observed in tissues with high plasma membrane content such as kidney and brain. The purpose of this study was to establish whether lipid bilayers, as models for cell membranes, could exchange magnetization with the water solvent and whether this effect could contribute to MTC observed in intact tissues. Magnetization transfer was measured in aqueous dispersions of egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) in the presence and absence of cholesterol. It was found that neither EPC bilayers nor cholesterol by themselves significantly exchanged magnetization with bulk water 1H. However, as the concentration of cholesterol was increased, the pseudo-first-order magnetization exchange rate increased to a maximum value of approximately 1 s-1. The cholesterol-induced 1H magnetization exchange may be related either to longer correlation times of the lipid or to an increase in the number of water molecules associated with the bilayer. These results indicate that EPC-cholesterol bilayers exchange 1H magnetization with bulk water. These results are consistent with lipid bilayer contributions to bulk water relaxation and MTC in intact biological tissues.",Excluded

Twenty-eight patients (42 sites) with painful bone metastases who received EBRT and were analyzed retrospectively. Eight patients (12 sites) received SF. Of the remaining 20 patients (30 sites), 10 received MFs at moderate doses (20-30 Gy; 17 sites) and 10 received MFs at high doses (36-52 Gy; 13 sites). Overall response was achieved at 83% (35) of all sites; 75% (9) and 87% (26) for the SF and MF patients (88%, moderate dose; 85%, high dose), respectively. No significant differences in overall response were observed between each fraction schedule.

2318,"Short and long-term evaluation of the impact of proton minibeam radiation therapy on motor, emotional and cognitive functions Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most frequently used methods for cancer treatment. Despite remarkable advancements in RT techniquesthe treatment of radioresistant tumours (i.e. high-grade gliomas) is not yet satisfactory. Finding novel approaches less damaging for normal tissues is of utmost importance. This would make it possible to increase the dose applied to tumours, resulting in an improvement in the cure rate. Along this line, proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) is a novel strategy that allows the spatial modulation of the dose, leading to minimal damage to brain structures compared to a high dose (25 Gy in one fraction) of standard proton therapy (PT). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether pMBRT also preserves important cerebral functions. Comprehensive longitudinal behavioural studies were performed in irradiated (peak dose of 57 Gy in one fraction) and control rats to evaluate the impact of pMBRT on motor function (motor coordination, muscular tonus, and locomotor activity), emotional function (anxiety, fear, motivation, and impulsivity), and cognitive function (learning, memory, temporal processing, and decision making). The evaluations, which were conducted over a period of 10 months, showed no significant motor or emotional dysfunction in pMBRT-irradiated rats compared with control animals. Concerning cognitive functions, similar performance was observed between the groups, although some slight learning delays might be present in some of the tests in the long term after irradiation.

SR exposure results in multiple neurocognitive impairments. Recently, our cross-species (mouse/rat) studies reported impaired associative memory formation in both species following a chronic 6-month low dose exposure to a mixed field of neutrons (1 mGy/day for a total dose pf 18 cGy). In the present study, we report neutron exposure induced synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex, accompanied by microglial activation and significant synaptic loss in the hippocampus. In a parallel study, neutron exposure was also found to alter fluorescence assisted single synaptosome LTP (FASS-LTP) in the hippocampus of rats, that may be related to a reduced ability to insert AMPAR into the post-synaptic membrane, which may arise from increased phosphorylation of the serine 845 residue of the GluA1 subunit. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time, that low dose chronic neutron irradiation impacts homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-cortical circuit in two rodent species, and that the ability to successfully encode associative recognition memory is a dynamic, multicircuit process, possibly involving compensatory changes in AMPAR density on the synaptic surface.",Included
2024,"Effect of cell-mediated immune factors on the replication of an attenuated temperature-sensitive mutant of vaccinia virus Studies of the in vivo multiplication of an attenuated temperature-sensitive strain of vaccinia virus (ts2) indicated that temperature sensitivity alone could not account for the attenuation. Immunodepressive treatment of intracerebrally inoculated mice had a dramatic stimulatory effect on the multiplication of the attenuated strain and suggested that establishment of ts2 infection in the mice was hindered by host defense mechanisms mediated by cellular elements. Experiments carried out in vitro with the 51Cr release assay showed that cells infected with the ts2 mutant represented more susceptible targets to the cytotoxic action of immune spleen cells than cells infected with the parent vaccinia strain. Moreover, it appeared that ts2 replication, compared with wild-type replication in vitro, was more inhibited by the immune spleen cells. Although this work did not evaluate the role of specifically sensitized lymphocytes within the lesions, indirect evidence suggests that lymphocytes could cause a more effective halt in ts2 virus multiplication than in wild-type multiplication.",Excluded

To date, all MRI studies on RF heating of medical implants have been performed in horizontal closed-bore systems. Vertical MRI scanners have a fundamentally different distribution of electric and magnetic fields and are now available at 1.2T, capable of high-resolution structural and functional MRI. This work presents the first simulation study of RF heating of DBS implants in high-field vertical scanners. Method(s): We performed finite element electromagnetic simulations to calculate specific absorption rate (SAR) at tips of DBS leads during MRI in a commercially available 1.2T vertical coil compared to a 1.5T horizontal scanner. Both isolated leads and fully implanted systems were included. Result(s): We found 10- to 30-fold reduction in SAR implication at tips of isolated DBS leads, and up to 19-fold SAR reduction at tips of leads in fully implanted systems in vertical coils compared to horizontal birdcage coils. Conclusion(s): If confirmed in larger patient cohorts and verified experimentally, this result can open the door to plethora of structural and functional MRI applications to guide, interpret, and advance DBS therapy.

After comparing the habituation indices, the multi-scale entropies and the time dependent intrinsic correlations of their SSVEP signals, we reached a tentative conclusion that sharp red and white light pulses flickering barely above their CFF frequencies can replace commonly used 13Hz stimuli to effectively cause SSVEP habituation among normal subjects. Empirical results showed that consecutive short bursts of light can produce more consistent responses than a single prolonged stimulation. Since these high frequency stimuli do not run the risk of triggering migraine or seizure attacks, further tests of these stimuli on migraine patients are warranted in order to verify their effectiveness.",Excluded

It either did not form a tumor, or grew into a small encapsulated tumor, and did not cause death or neurological deficits in the animals. Gamma-irradiation of the animals (head only) with implanted C6#11 induced a fully developed invasive tumor that killed them within 25 days. Three grays of radiation of C6#11 cells two hours prior to implantation induced their tumorigenicity as well.

The lack of efficacy and cognitive and behavioral consequences of whole brain irradiation have prompted clinicians to select patients for alternative therapies. This study analyzes the effectiveness of Leksell gamma unit therapy for metastatic melanoma to the brain. METHOD(S): We present our experience with 59 Leksell gamma unit treatment sessions in 45 consecutive patients who presented with metastatic melanoma to the brain. Five of these procedures were performed as salvage therapy for patients who needed second radiosurgical treatment for new lesions that were remote from the previous targets and were not included in the overall analyses. RESULT(S): The population included 78% male patients. The mean patient age was 53 years (age range, 24-80 yr). The mean time from diagnosis of primary melanoma to discovery of brain metastasis was 43 months (median, 27.5 mo; range, 1-180 mo). At the time of diagnosis of brain disease, 35.5% of the patients (16 of 45 patients) had neurological symptoms, 77.7% (35 of 45 patients) had known visceral metastases, and 11.1% (5 of 45 patients) had seizure disorders. Eighty-six percent of the lesions (80 of 93 lesions) were cortical, 12% (11 of 93 lesions) were cerebellar, 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were pontine, and 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were thalamic. Fifty-seven percent of the sessions (31 of 54 sessions) were performed for a single lesion, 24.1% (13 of 54 sessions) for two lesions, 9.2% (5 of 54 sessions) for three lesions, 7.4% (4 of 54 sessions) for four lesions, and 1.8% (1 of 54 sessions) for five lesions. The mean treatment volume was 5.6 cc, with a mean prescription of 21.6 Gy to the 56.0% mean isodose line. The median survival time of the patients in our population, using Kaplan-Meier curves, was 43 months from the time of diagnosis of primary melanoma (range, 3-180 mo) and 8 months (range, 1-20 mo) from the time of gamma knife treatment. Complications included seizures within 24 hours of the procedure in four patients, with transient nausea and vomiting in three patients, transient worsening of preprocedure paresis responsive to steroids in three patients, and increased confusion in one patient. All 45 patients were located for follow-up (mean follow-up duration, 1 yr). After gamma knife treatment, 78% of the patients (35 of 45 patients) experienced either improved or stable neurological symptomatology before death or at the time of the latest follow-up examination. There were 26 deaths (58%). The cause of death was determined to be neurological in only 2 of 45 patients (7.7%). Follow-up magnetic resonance images revealed a 97% local tumor control rate of gamma knife-treated lesions, with 28% radiographic disappearance (9 of 32 cases). Six patients developed new lesions remote from radiosurgical targets and underwent second procedures. CONCLUSION(S): Although metastatic melanoma to the brain continues to have a foreboding prognosis for long-term survival, gamma knife radiosurgery seems to be a relatively safe, noninvasive, palliative therapy, halting or reversing neurological progression in 77.8% of treated patients (35 of 45 patients). The survival rate matches or exceeds those previously reported for surgery and other forms of radiotherapy.

Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) involves intensity-modulated RT using a coplanar arc. An inclined head position might improve dose distribution during HS-WBRT using VMAT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study analyzed 8 patients receiving brain RT with inclined head positioning. A comparable set of CT images simulating a non-inclined head position was obtained by rotating the original CT set. HS-WBRT plans of coplanar VMAT for each CT set were generated with a prescribed dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Maximum dose to the hippocampi was limited to 16 Gy; to the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and eyeballs this was confined to less than 37.5 Gy; for the lenses to 8 Gy. Dosimetric parameters of the two different plans of 8 patients were compared with paired t-test.RESULTS: Mean inclined head angle was 11.09 +/- 0.73degree.

2190,"Calvarial and skull base metastases: expanding the clinical utility of Gamma Knife surgery OBJECT: Traditionally, the treatment of choice for patients with metastases to the calvaria or skull base has been conventional radiation therapy. Because patients with systemic malignancies are also at risk for intracranial metastases, the utility of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for these patients has been explored to reduce excess radiation exposure to the perilesional brain parenchyma. The purpose of this study was to report the efficacy of GKS for the treatment of calvarial metastases and skull base lesions.METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of 21 patients with at least 1 calvarial or skull base metastatic lesion treated with GKS during 2001-2013. For 7 calvarial lesions, a novel technique, in which a bolus was placed over the treatment site, was used. For determination of local control or disease progression, radiation therapy data were examined and posttreatment MR images and oncology records were reviewed. Survival times from the date of procedure were estimated by using Kaplan-Meier analyses.RESULTS: The median patient age at treatment was 57 years (range 29-84 years). A total of 19 (90%) patients received treatment for single lesions, 1 patient received treatment for 3 lesions, and 1 patient received treatment for 4 lesions. The most common primary tumor was breast cancer (24% of patients). Per lesion, the median clinical and radiographic follow-up times were 10.3 months (range 0-71.9 months) and 7.1 months (range 0-61.3 months), respectively. Of the 26 lesions analyzed, 14 (54%) were located in calvarial bones and 12 (46%) were located in the skull base. The median lesion volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 0.3-55.6 cm(3)), and the median prescription margin dose was 15 Gy (range 13-24 Gy). The median overall survival time for all patients was 35.9 months, and the 1-year local control rate was 88.9% (95% CI 74.4%-100%). Local control rates did not differ between lesions treated with the bolus technique and those treated with traditional methods or between calvarial lesions and skull base lesions (p > 0.05). Of the 3 patients for whom local treatment failed, 1 patient received no further treatment and 2 patients responded to salvage chemotherapy. Subsequent brain parenchymal metastases developed in 2 patients, who then underwent GKS.CONCLUSIONS: GKS is an effective treatment modality for patients with metastases to the calvarial bones or skull base. For patients with superficial calvarial lesions, a novel approach with bolus application resulted in excellent rates of local control. GKS provides an effective therapeutic alternative to conventional radiation therapy and should be considered for patients at risk for calvarial metastases and brain parenchymal metastases.",Excluded
1736,"A phase I dose escalation study of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy as salvage therapy for persistent or recurrent malignant glioma Purpose: A phase I dose escalation of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (H-SRT) in recurrent or persistent malignant gliomas as a means of increasing the biologically effective dose and decreasing the high rate of reoperation due to toxicity associated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and brachytherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): From November 1994 to September 1996, 25 lesions in 20 patients with clinical and/or imaging evidence of malignant glioma persistence or recurrence received salvage H-SRT, Nineteen patients at the time of initial diagnosis had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and one patient had an anaplastic astrocytoma. All of these patients with tumor persistence or recurrence had received initial fractionated radiation therapy (RT) with a mean and median dose of 60 Gy (44.0-72.0 Gy). The median time from completion of initial RT to H-SRT was 3.1 months (0.7-45.5 months). Salvage H-SRT was delivered using daily 3.0- 3.5 Gy fractions (fxs). Three different total dose levels were sequentially evaluated: 24.0 Gy/3.0 Gy fxs (five lesions), 30.0 Gy/3.0 Gy fxs (10 lesions), and 35.0 Gy/3.5 Gy fxs (nine lesions). Median treated tumor volume measured 12.66 cc (0.89-47.5 cc). The median ratio of prescription volume to tumor volume was 2,8 (1.4-5.0). Toxicity was judged by RTOG criteria. Response was determined by clinical neurologic improvement, a decrease in steroid dose without clinical deterioration, and/or radiologic imaging. Result(s): No grade 3 toxicities were observed and no reoperation due to toxicity was required. At the time of analysis, 13 of 20 patients had died. The median survival time from the completion of H-SRT is 10.5 months with a 1-year survival rate of 20%. Neurological improvement was found in 45% of patients. Decreased steroid requirements occurred in 60% of patients. Minor imaging response was noted in 22% of patients. Using Fisher's exact test, response of any kind correlated strongly to total dose (p = 0.0056). None of six lesions treated with 21 Gy or 24 Gy responded, whereas there was a 79% response rate among the 19 lesions treated with 30 or 35 Gy. Tumor volumes <=20 cc were associated with a higher likelihood of response (p = 0.053). Conclusion(s): H-SRT used in this cohort of previously irradiated patients with malignant glioma was not associated with the need for reoperation due to toxicity or grade 3 toxicity. This low toxicity profile and encouraging H- SRT dose-related response outcome justifies further evaluation and dose escalation.",Excluded
1686,"Intracranial hyperthermia through local photothermal heating with a fiberoptic microneedle device BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The fiberoptic microneedle device (FMD) seeks to leverage advantages of both laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to increase volumetric dispersal of locally infused chemotherapeutics through sub-lethal photothermal heat generation. This study focused on determination of photothermal damage thresholds with 1,064 nm light delivered through the FMD into in vivo rat models.MATERIALS AND METHODS: FMDs capable of co-delivering laser energy and fluid agents were fabricated through a novel off-center splicing technique involving fusion of a multimode fiberoptic to light-guiding capillary tubing. FMDs were positioned at a depth of 2.5 mm within the cerebrum of male rats with fluoroptic temperature probes placed within 1 mm of the FMD tip. Irradiation (without fluid infusion) was conducted at laser powers of 0 (sham), 100, 200, 500, or 750 mW. Evans blue-serum albumin conjugated complex solution (EBA) and laser energy co-delivery were performed in a second set of preliminary experiments.RESULTS: Maximum, steady-state temperatures of 38.7 +/- 1.6 and 42.0 +/- 0.9 degreeC were measured for the 100 and 200 mW experimental groups, respectively. Histological investigation demonstrated needle insertion damage alone for sham and 100 mW irradiations. Photothermal damage was detected at 200 mW, although observable thermal damage was limited to a small penumbra of cerebral cortical microcavitation and necrosis that immediately surrounded the region of FMD insertion. Co-delivery of EBA and laser energy presented increased volumetric dispersal relative to infusion-only controls.CONCLUSION: Fluoroptic temperature sensing and histopathological assessments demonstrated that a laser power of 100 mW results in sub-lethal brain hyperthermia, and the optimum, sub-lethal target energy range is likely 100-200 mW. The preliminary FMD-CED experiments confirmed the feasibility of augmenting fluid dispersal using slight photothermal heat generation, demonstrating the FMD's potential as a way to increase the efficacy of CED in treating MG.",Excluded
2384,"Patterns of care and outcomes of chemoradiation versus radiation alone for MGMT promoter unmethylated glioblastoma OBJECTIVE: The recommended treatment for O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter unmethylated glioblastoma (GBM) is radiation therapy with concurrent/adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). However, it is well known that the clinical benefit from TMZ is lower in these patients. We sought to analyze patterns of care and outcomes of chemoradiation versus radiation alone in this cohort using a large, hospital database.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM from 2010 to 2012 who received radiation (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT) were identified in the National Cancer Database. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of receiving chemoradiation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess overall survival (OS) by treatment group and Cox regression analysis was used to assess impact of covariates on OS.RESULTS: There were 738 patients who met the study criteria, of which 107 (14.5%) received RT alone and 631 (85.5%) received CRT with median RT dose 6000cGy for both groups. Median follow up for living patients was 21.9 months. Ninety-two (12.5%) patients did not undergo any resection, 330 (44.7%) underwent a subtotal resection and 316 (42.8%) had a gross total resection. The median and 2-year OS was 16.8 months and 24.7% for RT alone compared to 15.6 months and 25.9% for the CRT group (p=0.250). On multivariable analysis, the addition of chemotherapy had no impact on survival (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86-1.46, p=0.396).CONCLUSION: Despite the routine use of chemoradiation among patients with MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM, there does not appear to be a survival benefit compared to radiation alone.",Excluded
2152,"Interdigitating versus concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for limited small cell lung cancer Purpose: Sequencing and timing of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for limited small-cell lung cancer (LSCLC) was studied in two consecutive trials. Methods and Materials: In the interdigitating (IDG) trial, three cycles of COPE (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/M<sup>2</sup> IV Day 1, vincristine 2 mg IV Day 8, cisplatin [DDP] 20 mg/M<sup>2</sup> Days 1-3, etoposide 100 mg/M<sup>2</sup> IV Days 1-3), were followed by thoracic radiation therapy (1.5 Gy bid 5-6 h apart, repeated twice at 3-week intervals) to give 45 Gy in 9 weeks; COPE was given during the intervals and for two more cycles. Operable patients had thoracotomy followed by IDG. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), 2.0 Gy x 15 fractions with a total dose of 30 Gy in 3 weeks, was given to the complete responders (CR) after completion of chemotherapy. In the concurrent (CON) trial, patients received DDP 60 mg/M<sup>2</sup> IV Day 1, and etoposide 120 mg/M<sup>2</sup> IV Days 1-3 for four cycles, every 3 weeks, and concurrent thoracic radiation therapy to 45 Gy with either 1.8 Gy daily, for 5 weeks or 1.5 Gy bid for 3 weeks. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was given to the complete responders, 2.5 Gy daily for 2 weeks (25 Gy) (approximately 3 months after the initiation of treatment). Result(s): The IDG group had 28 evaluable patients with median follow-up of 17.5 months. The CON group had 33 evaluable patients with median follow-up of 21 months. Overall survival rates for IDG patients were 79% at 1 year, 39% at 2 years, 30% at 3 years, and 27% at 4 years compared to 93%, 70%, 51%, and 46%, respectively, for the patients treated with CON (p = 0.01). Loco-regional recurrence (44%) and distant metastasis (48%) was more frequent as the first site of failure in the IDG group compared to the CON group (30% and 30%, respectively). Brain metastases constituted 30% of first metastases with IDG compared to none with CON. Esophagitis was significantly greater with CON. Hematologic and pulmonary toxicity were similar with IDG and CON. One death due to infection was seen in each treatment group. Conclusion(s): Concurrent chemoradiotherapy appears to be more effective than IDG. Earlier administration of PCI with concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation may reduce the risk of brain metastasis.",Excluded
2381,"A semianalytic model to investigate the potential applications of x-ray scatter imaging Although x-ray scatter is generally regarded as a nuisance that reduces radiographic contrast (C) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in conventional images, many technologies have been devised to extract useful information from the scattered x rays. A systematic approach, however, for analyzing the potential applications of x-ray scatter imaging has been lacking. Therefore, we have formulated a simple but useful semianalytic model to investigate C and SNR in scatter images. Our model considers the imaging of a target object against a background material of the same dimensions when both are situated within a water phantom. We have selected biological materials (liver, fat, bone, muscle, blood, and brain matter) for which intermolecular form factors for coherent scattering were available. Analytic relationships between C and SNR were derived, and evaluated numerically as the target object thickness (0.01-40 mm) and photon energy (10-200 keV) were systematically varied. The fundamental limits of scatter imaging were assessed via calculations that assumed that all first-order scatter exiting the phantom, over 4pi steradians, formed the signal. Calculations for a restricted detector solid angle were then performed. For the task of imaging white brain matter versus blood in a 15 cm thick water phantom, the maximum SNR, over all energies, for images based on the detection of all forward scatter within the angular range 2degree- 12degreeis greater than that of primary images for target object thicknesses <= 23 mm. Use of the backscattered x rays within the range 158degree-178degreeto image objects 3 cm below the surface of a 25 cm thick water phantom allows the liver to be distinguished from fat with a SNR superior to that of primary imaging when the objects are <=22 mm thick. Our analysis confirms the usefulness of scattered x rays, and provides simple methods for determining the regimes of medical interest in which x-ray scatter imaging could outperform conventional imaging.",Excluded
2262,"Radiation-induced intra- and extra-cranial high-grade myxofibrosarcoma with tumor bleeding Radiation-induced secondary malignant neoplasms in central nervous system tumor survivors have become a problem of increasing concern over the last 20 years because of rare but serious and potentially fatal complications.

He underwent craniotomy with gross total removal of the tumor and surrounding hematoma in August 2005. The tumor was a high-grade malignant myxofibrosarcoma (Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer Grade III [out of III]). Radiation-induced malignant myxofibrosarcoma with tumor bleeding is an infrequent complication of radiotherapy. Although rare, it should always be kept in mind with regards to the differential diagnosis of a lesion that develops several years after radiation therapy.

2276,"Dynamics of Ca(2+) and Na(+) in the dendrites of mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells evoked by parallel fibre stimulation Ca2+ and Na+ play important roles in neurons, such as in synaptic plasticity. Their concentrations in neurons change dynamically in response to synaptic inputs, but their kinetics have not been compared directly. Here, we show the mechanisms and dynamics of Ca2+ and Na+ transients by simultaneous monitoring in Purkinje cell dendrites in mouse cerebellar slices. High frequency parallel fibre stimulation (50 Hz, 3-50-times) depolarized Purkinje cells, and Ca2+ transients were observed at the anatomically expected sites. The magnitude of the Ca2+ transients increased linearly with increasing numbers of parallel fibre inputs. With 50 stimuli, Ca2+ transients lasted for seconds, and the peak [Ca2+] reached approximately 100 microm, which was much higher than that reported previously, although it was still confined to a part of the dendrite. In contrast, Na+ transients were sustained for tens of seconds and diffused away from the stimulated site. Pharmacological interventions revealed that Na+ influx through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and Ca2+ influx through P-type Ca channels were essential players, that AMPA receptors did not operate as a Ca2+ influx pathway and that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through inositol trisphosphate receptors or ryanodine receptors did not contribute greatly to the large Ca2+ transients.",Excluded
1364,"Effect of radiographic techniques (kVp and mAs) on image quality and patient doses in digital subtraction angiography We investigated how varying the x-ray tube voltage and image receptor input exposure affected image quality and patient radiation doses in interventional neuroradiologic imaging. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images were obtained of a phantom with 1 mm diameter vessels containing iodine at concentrations between 4.5 and 50 mg/cc. The detection threshold concentration of iodine was determined by inspecting DSA images obtained at a range of x-ray tube voltages and input exposure levels. Surface doses were obtained from measured x-ray tube output data, and corresponding values of energy imparted were determined using the exposure-area product incident on the phantom. In one series of experiments, the air kerma at the image intensifier (X) was varied between 0.44 muGy per frame and 8.8 muGy per frame at a constant x-ray tube voltage of 70 kVp. In a second series of experiments, the tube voltage was varied between 50 and 100 kVp, and the mAs adjusted to maintain a constant exposure level at the input of the image intensifier. At a constant x-ray tube voltage, the surface dose and energy imparted were directly proportional to the input exposure per frame used to acquire the DSA images. On our DSA system operated below 2.2 muGy per frame, the threshold iodine concentration was found to be proportional to X<sup>-0.57</sup>, which is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction for a quantum noise limited imaging system. Above 2.2 muGy per frame, however, the threshold iodine concentration was proportional to X<sup>-0.26</sup>, indicating that increasing the input exposure above this value will only achieve modest improvements in image quality. At a constant image intensifier input exposure level, increasing the x-ray tube voltage from 50 kVp to 100 kVp reduced the surface dose by a factor of 6.1, and the energy imparted by a factor of 3.5. The detection threshold iodine concentration was found to be proportional to kVp<sup>n</sup>, where n was 2.1 at 1.1 muGy per frame, and 1.6 at 3.9 muGy per frame. For clinical situations that can be modeled by a uniform phantom, reducing the x-ray tube voltage rather than increasing the exposure level would best achieve improvements on our DSA imaging system performance. © 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded

One year and six months later, he was resected for a right temporal-occipital brain metastatic tumor, and local cerebral irradiation at 30 Gy was performed. Four months later, new multiple brain metastases were detected in the cerebellum. We tried paclitaxel administration. It was continued on a weekly basis at 70 mg/m(2), and the brain metastases continued to diminish; in addition, gamma knife therapy led to an improvement in the quality of life. Although the patient had been told that he had only a month to live, he was improving dramatically. However, he died of sepsis due to Fournier's gangrene about 5 months later.

Beliefs about lung cancer and screening, particularly across race and ethnicity, and their influence on CT screening utilization are largely unexamined. Our study recruited asymptomatic, high-risk smokers, 55-74 years of age from primary care clinics in an academic urban hospital. Guided by the self-regulation theory, we evaluated cognitive and affective beliefs about lung cancer. Intention to screen for lung cancer with a CT scan was assessed by self-report. We used univariate and logistic regression analyses to compare beliefs about screening and intention to screen among minority (Blacks and Hispanics) and non-minority participants. Overall, we enrolled 108 participants, of which 40% were Black and 34% were Hispanic; the mean age was 62.3 years, and median pack-years of smoking was 26. We found that intention to screen was similar among minorities and non-minorities (p=0.19); however, Hispanics were less likely to report intention to screen if they had to pay for the test (p=0.02). Fatalistic beliefs, fear of radiation exposure, and anxiety related to CT scans were significantly associated with decreased intention to screen (p<0.05). Several differences were observed in minority versus non-minority participants' beliefs toward lung cancer and screening. In conclusion, we found that concerns about cost, which were particularly prominent among Hispanics, as well as fatalism and radiation exposure fears may constitute barriers to lung cancer screening. Lung cancer screening programs should address these factors to ensure broad participation, particularly among minorities.",Excluded

1781,"Experimental approaches to radiation-induced developmental abnormalities of the brain The developing mammalian brain is highly susceptible to ionizing radiation. Significant increases in microcephalus, heterotopic cortical gray matter, and mental retardation have been noted in prenatally exposed survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the highest risk in those exposed during 8-15 weeks after fertilization. This stage corresponds to day 15 of pregnancy for rats and day 13 for mice in terms of brain development. The initial damage produced by radiation at this stage is cell death in the ventricular zone of the brain mantle, the radiosensitive germinal cell population. Disturbances in the production of neuronal germinal cells, and their migration to the cerebral cortex, give rise to malformations of the brain, such as microcephalus, an absent corpus callosum, disorganized cortical architecture, and heterotopic gray matter. Histological abnormalities are produced by about 500 mGy or more, and reduced brain weight is produced by 250 mGy or more. Mitotic delay, on the other hand, in the ventricular cells is caused by 100 mGy or more. A similar threshold level is suggested in human cases in the induction of mental retardation. The lowest doses of X- and gamma-radiation that induce detectable biological effects in rats and mice are around 30 mGy in increasing acute cell death.",Excluded

1231,"The cortically evoked secondary depolarization affects the integrative properties of thalamic reticular neurons Corticothalamic terminals on thalamic reticular (RE) neurons account for most synapses from afferent pathways onto this nucleus and these inputs are more powerful than those from axon collaterals of thalamocortical neurons. Given the supremacy of cortical inputs, we analysed here the characteristics and possible mechanisms underlying a secondary component of the cortically elicited depolarization in RE neurons, recorded in cats under barbiturate anesthesia. Electrical stimulation of corticothalamic axons in the internal capsule evoked fixed and short-latency excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that, by increasing stimulation intensity and at hyperpolarized levels (< -70 mV), developed into low-threshold spikes and spindle oscillations. The threshold for spindle oscillations was 60% higher than that required for evoking minimal EPSPs. The evoked EPSPs included a secondary depolarizing component, which appeared approximately 5 ms after the peak of the initial component and was voltage dependent, i.e. most prominent between -70 mV and -85 mV, while being greatly reduced or absent at more hyperpolarized levels. The secondary depolarizing component was sensitive to QX-314 in the recording micropipette. We suggest that the secondary component of cortically evoked EPSPs in RE neurons is due to the dendritic activation of T-currents, with a probable contribution of the persistent Na+ current. This late component affected the integrative properties of RE neurons, including their spiking output and temporal summation of incoming cortical inputs.",Excluded

There is controversy regarding the role of platelet function testing with P2Y12 assay as a predictor of intraprocedural thromboembolic events. There is limited knowledge on whether procedural complexity influences these events.Methods: Data were collected retrospectively on 742 consecutive PED cases at a single institution. Patients with intraprocedural acute thrombosis were compared with patients without these events.Results: A cohort of 37 PED cases with acute in situ thrombosis (mean age 53.8 years, mean aneurysm size 8.4 mm) was matched with a cohort of 705 PED cases without intraprocedural thromboembolic events (mean age 56.4 years, mean aneurysm size 6.9 mm). All patients with in situ thrombosis received intra-arterial and/or intravenous abciximab. The two groups were evenly matched in patient demographics, previous treatment/subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and aneurysm location. There was no statistical difference in postprocedural P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values between the two groups, with a mean of 156 in the in situ thrombosis group vs 148 in the control group (p=0.5894). Presence of cervical carotid tortuosity, high cavernous internal carotid artery grade, need for multiple PED and vasospasm were not significantly different between the two groups. The in situ thrombosis group had statistically significant longer fluoroscopy time (60.4 vs 38.4 min, p<0.0001), higher radiation exposure (3476 vs 2160 mGy, p<0.0001), higher rates of adjunctive coiling (24.3% vs 8.37%, p=0.0010) and higher utilisation of balloon angioplasty (37.8% vs 12.2%, p<0.0001). Clinically, the in situ thrombosis cohort had higher incidence of major and minor stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage and length of stay.Conclusions: Predictors of procedural complexity (higher radiation exposure, longer fluoroscopy time, adjunctive coiling and need for balloon angioplasty) are associated with acute thrombotic events during PED placement, independent of PRU values.",Excluded

All but one (chloramphenicol) of these bioactive reagents substantially retarded the recovery and increased the death rate of such ""dark"" neurons. As concerns the dehydrating drugs and ion channel modulators, these effects are considered to be consequences of the fact that relatively large volumes (more than half of the original cell volume) of cytoplasmic fluid (water molecules, inorganic ions and metabolites) leave the affected cells through passive pores within a few minutes. The effects of the mitochondrial enzyme inhibitors appear to indicate that restoration of the original cell volume (recovery) demands metabolic (enzyme-mediated) energy.

1477,"H2O2-Sensitive Isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1 Act in Bitter-Sensing Gustatory Neurons to Promote Avoidance of UV During Egg-Laying The evolutionarily conserved TRPA1 channel can sense various stimuli including temperatures and chemical irritants. Recent results have suggested that specific isoforms of Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1) are UV-sensitive and that their UV sensitivity is due to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. However, whether such UV sensitivity served any physiological purposes in animal behavior was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms promote avoidance of UV when adult Drosophila females are selecting sites for egg-laying. First, we show that blind/visionless females are still capable of sensing and avoiding UV during egg-laying when intensity of UV is high yet within the range of natural sunlight. Second, we show that such vision-independent UV avoidance is mediated by a group of bitter-sensing neurons on the proboscis that express H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms. We show that these bitter-sensing neurons exhibit dTRPA1-dependent UV sensitivity. Importantly, inhibiting activities of these bitter-sensing neurons, reducing their dTRPA1 expression, or reducing their H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity all significantly reduced blind females' UV avoidance, whereas selectively restoring a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive isoform of dTRPA1 in these neurons restored UV avoidance.

Together, these results demonstrate a physiological role of the UV-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms, reveal that adult Drosophila possess at least two sensory systems for detecting UV, and uncover an unexpected role of bitter-sensing taste neurons in UV sensing.",Excluded
1715,"Radiation dose and intra-articular access: comparison of the lateral mortise and anterior midline approaches to fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections PURPOSE: To compare the lateral mortise and anterior midline approaches to fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections with respect to successful intra-articular needle placement, fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, and dose area product (DAP).MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant. 498 fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections were performed or supervised by one of nine staff radiologists from 11/1/2010-12/31/2013. The injection approach was determined by operator preference. Images were reviewed on a PACS workstation to determine the injection approach (lateral mortise versus anterior midline) and to confirm intra-articular needle placement. Fluoroscopy time (minutes), radiation dose (mGy), and DAP (muGy-m(2)) were recorded and compared using the student's t-test (fluoroscopy time) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test (radiation dose and DAP).RESULTS: There were 246 lateral mortise injections and 252 anterior midline injections. Two lateral mortise injections were excluded from further analysis because no contrast was administered. Intra-articular location of the needle tip was documented in 242/244 lateral mortise injections and 252/252 anterior midline injections. Mean fluoroscopy time was shorter for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (0.7 +/- 0.5 min versus 1.2 +/- 0.8 min, P < 0.0001). Mean radiation dose and DAP were less for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (2.1 +/- 3.7 mGy versus 2.5 +/- 3.5 mGy, P = 0.04; 11.5 +/- 15.3 muGy-m(2) versus 13.5 +/- 17.3 muGy-m(2), P = 0.006).CONCLUSION: Both injection approaches resulted in nearly 100% rates of intra-articular needle placement, but the lateral mortise approach used approximately 40% less fluoroscopy time and delivered 15% lower radiation dose and DAP to the patient.",Excluded
1884,"Late effects of intracranial radiation induces resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy that is partially reversible with CSF-1R inhibition Primary and metastatic CNS malignancies remain incurable despite aggressive therapy with surgery and radiation. Immunotherapy has shown promise in many solid and hematologic malignancies, however, results have been disappointing in recurrent primary CNS tumors. Additionally, while upfront immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) has shown equal efficacy intracranially and extracranially, these responses are abrogated in previously irradiated brain lesions. Together, we hypothesize that radiation modulates the brain microenvironment to permit tumor growth and suppress anti-tumor immunity. As such, we developed a mouse model whereby orthotopic transplantation of murine gliomas into previously irradiated normal brain results in a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Moreover, the ICB-sensitive glioma cell line, GL261, is resistant to ICB therapy when implanted into a previously irradiated brain microenvironment. Immunophenotyping revealed a decreased ratio of CD8:CD4 T cells within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from previously irradiated mice though the relative frequency of neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells was slightly increased and no difference in PD-1 expression was observed. Alternatively, the frequency of microglia and tumor-infiltrating CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was increased following irradiation suggesting a potential role for these myeloid cells in the immunosuppressive effects noted. Consistently, the administration of a CSF-1R inhibitor, which has been shown to reduce the number of microglia and block MDSCs, partially resensitizes GL261 cells to ICB therapy. In summary, we have developed a model that recapitulates the late effects of radiation on immunotherapy-resistance in CNS tumors. Preliminary results suggest that these late radiation effects are mediated through an increased myeloid population, and that inhibition of these cell subsets via the CSF-1R pathway can partially restore efficacy of ICB therapy. Furthermore, this model may provide further insight into additional therapeutic strategies that can be used to overcome these mechanisms of resistance induced by radiation therapy in the CNS.",Excluded
1906,"Impact of brain tumors and radiotherapy on the presence of gadolinium in the brain after repeated administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents: an experimental study in rats PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations induced by an experimental tumor and radiotherapy on MRI signal intensity (SI) in deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and the presence of gadolinium after repeated administration of a linear gadolinium-based contrast agent in rats.METHODS: Eighteen Fischer rats were divided into a tumor (gliosarcoma, GS9L model), a radiotherapy, and a control group. All animals received 5 daily injections (1.8 mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine. For tumor-bearing animals, the BBB disruption was confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI. Animals from the tumor and radiation group underwent radiotherapy in 6 fractions of 5 Gray. The SI ratio between DCN and brain stem was evaluated on T1-weigthed MRI at baseline and 1 week after the last administration. Subsequently, the brain was dissected for gadolinium quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was done with the Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTS: An increased but similar DCN/brain stem SI ratio was found for all three groups (p = 0.14). The gadolinium tissue concentrations (median, nmol/g) were 6.7 (tumor), 6.3 (radiotherapy), and 6.8 (control) in the cerebellum (p = 0.64) and 17.8/14.6 (tumor), 20.0/18.9 (radiotherapy), and 17.8/15.9 (control) for the primary tumor (p = 0.98) and the contralateral hemisphere (p = 0.41) of the cerebrum, respectively.CONCLUSION: An experimental brain tumor treated by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone did not alter DCN signal hyperintensity and gadolinium concentration in the rat brain 1 week after repeated administration of gadopentetate. This suggests that a local BBB disruption does not affect the amount of retained gadolinium in the brain.",Included
1198,"Radiation necrosis or glioma recurrence: is computer-assisted stereotactic biopsy useful? Fifty-one patients with supratentorial glioma treated with external beam radiotherapy (median dose 59.5 Gy) who then demonstrated clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression underwent stereotactic biopsy to differentiate tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis. The original tumor histological type was diffuse or fibrillary astrocytoma in 21 patients (41%), oligodendroglioma in 13 (26%), and oligoastrocytoma in 17 (33%); 40 tumors (78%) were low-grade (Kernohan Grade 1 or 2). The median time to suspected disease progression was 28 months. Stereotactic biopsy showed tumor recurrence in 30 patients (59%), radiation necrosis in three (6%), and a mixture of both in 17 (33%); one patient (2%) had a parenchymal radiation-induced chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The tumor type at stereotactic biopsy was similar to the original tumor type and was astrocytoma in 24 patients (47%), oligodendroglioma in eight (16%), oligoastrocytoma in 16 (31%), unclassifiable in two (4%), and chondroblastic osteosarcoma in one patient (2%). At biopsy, however, only 19 tumors (37%) were low grade (Kernohan Grade 1 or 2). Subsequent surgery confirmed the stereotactic biopsy histological findings in eight patients. Follow-up examination showed 14 patients alive with a median survival of 1 year for the entire group. Median survival times after biopsy were 0.83 year for patients with tumor recurrence and 1.86 years for patients with both tumor recurrence and radionecrosis; these findings were significantly different (p = 0.008, log-rank test). No patient with radiation necrosis alone died. Other factors associated with reduced survival were a high proportion of residual tumor (p = 0.024), a low proportion of radionecrosis (p < 0.001), and a Kernohan Grade of 3 or 4 (p = 0.005). In conclusion, in patients with previously irradiated supratentorial gliomas in whom radionecrosis or tumor recurrence was clinically or radiographically suspected, results of stereotactic biopsy could be used to differentiate tumor recurrence, radiation necrosis, a mixture of both lesions, or radiation-induced neoplasm. In addition, biopsy results could predict survival rates.",Excluded

2319,"Ketamine pre-treatment dissociates the effects of electroconvulsive stimulation on mossy fibre sprouting and cellular proliferation in the dentate gyrus Electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), the experimental analogue of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), has been shown to produce both functional and structural effects in the hippocampal formation in infrahuman species. These changes may relate to the antidepressant and cognitive effects of ECT observed in patients treated for severe depressive disorders. Recent studies have described both enhanced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and sprouting of mossy fibre projections from granule cells. The behavioural significance of these effects remains uncertain. In this study, we examined whether ketamine, a clinically available non-competitive NMDA receptor channel blocker, could block both of these ""trophic"" effects. Rats were given a course of eight spaced ECS or sham treatments under either halothane or ketamine anaesthesia. The thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine was administered to assess the degree of hippocampal cell proliferation and mossy fibre sprouting was quantified using the Timm staining method. Pre-treatment with ketamine dissociated these effects such that mossy fibre sprouting was attenuated significantly, while cell proliferation was unaffected. This dissociation may prove useful in determining the behavioural significance of these hippocampal changes, if any, for either the antidepressant or cognitive consequences of ECT.",Excluded

Initial screening was done using questionnaires emphasizing on impaired sexual function and menstrual disturbance plus measurement of serum levels of thyroxine, free thyroxine index, thyrotropic hormone, prolactin, and additionally testosterone for males only. Those showing abnormalities were subjected to detailed pituitary function tests. Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction was found in 7 female patients and only 1 male patient. A delayed TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone suggesting a hypothalamic disorder was seen in 6 of the affected female patients, and hyperprolactinaemia in also 6. None of the patients had evidence of diabetes insipidus. Hypopituitarism became symptomatic 2-5 years after RT with a mean latent interval of 3.8 years. A practical protocol for regular endocrine assessment for NPC patients after RT has been proposed. Multiple linear regression analysis of the radiotherapeutic data from the 11 female patients indicates that the likelihood of late occurrence of symptomatic hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction following RT is dependent on the TDF of the target dose to the nasopharyngeal region and the height of the upper margin of the opposed lateral facial fields above the diaphragma sellae (coefficient of multiple correlation = 0.9025). Except when the sphenoid sinus or the middle cranial fossa is involved, it is advisable to set the height of the upper margin of the lateral facial field at a level no higher than the diaphragma sellae. The hypothalamus and possibly the pituitary stalk as well may sustain permanent damage by doses of radiation within the conventional radiotherapeutic range for carcinomas.",Excluded

[Czech] Within 12-year period (1992-2004) 19 patients with trigeminal schwannomas underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery at our department of Na Homolce Hospital. Fifteen patients already had a follow-up after the treatment, and they were observed for the minimum of 12 and the maximum of 120 months, median 54 months. The group of patients consisted of 8 women and 7 men with the median age of 45 years. Seven patients underwent one to three microsurgical operations before radjosurgery. The tumour target volume ranged from 2 100 mm<sup>3</sup> to 18 000 mm<sup>3</sup> (median 9 600 mm<sup>3</sup>). Thirteen patients were subjected to irradiation of the whole tumour volume, in two cases the irradiation was only partial. The minimum tumour marginal dose ranged from 10 to 15 Gy (median 12 Gy) and it was delivered to 50% isoclose line. The tumour growth control was reached in 93% (14 cases). In 3 patients, the tumour regressed completely, and in 8 patients there occurred a significant reduction of the tumour volume. No further tumour growth was seen in one case, progress appeared in three cases. Eleven (73%) patients showed clinical improvement, 2 were without any change, and new neurological symptoms occurred in one patient. The fifteenth patient whose large tumour compressing the brain stem had been subjected to partial irradiation died of septicaemia 9 months after the treatment. Five patients had a cystic type of schwannomas, and four of them suffered from transient neurological deficits after irradiation as a consequence of an enlargement of the cystic part of the tumour. Two cases were tackled by stereopuncture, the third case was dealt with by the cyst marsupialisation. Radiosurgery has shown to be an effective primary as well as secondary treatment modality for small- and medium-size trigeminal schwannomas as the local tumour growth control is 93 % with a low morbidity.",Excluded
2188,"Hearing loss raises excitability in the auditory cortex Developmental hearing impairments compromise sound discrimination, speech acquisition, and cognitive function; however, the adjustments of functional properties in the primary auditory cortex (A1) remain unknown. We induced sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in developing gerbils and then reared the animals for several days. The intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were subsequently examined in a thalamocortical brain slice preparation with whole-cell recordings and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. SNHL neurons displayed a depolarized resting membrane potential, an increased input resistance, and a higher incidence of sustained firing. They also exhibited significantly larger thalamocortically and intracortically evoked excitatory synaptic responses, including a greater susceptibility to the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 and the NR2B subunit antagonist ifenprodil. This correlated with an increase in NR2B labeling of asymmetric synapses, as visualized ultrastructurally. Furthermore, decreased frequency and increased amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in SNHL neurons suggest that a decline in presynaptic release properties is compensated by an increased excitatory response. To verify that the increased thalamocortical excitation was elicited by putative monosynaptic connections, minimum amplitude ventral medial geniculate nucleus-evoked EPSCs were recorded. These minimum-evoked responses were of larger amplitude, and the NMDAergic currents were also larger and longer in SNHL neurons. These findings were supported by significantly longer AP-5-sensitive durations and larger amplitudes of mEPSCs. Last, the amplitudes of intracortically evoked monosynaptic and polysynaptic GABAergic inhibitory synaptic responses were significantly smaller in SNHL neurons. These alterations in cellular properties after deafness reflect an attempt by A1 to sustain an operative level of cortical excitability that may involve homeostatic mechanisms.",Excluded
2056,"Similarity pattern analysis in mutational distributions The validity and applicability of the statistical procedure - similarity pattern analysis (SPAN) - to the study of mutational distributions (MDs) was demonstrated with two sets of data.

The second was a recently summarized data on the distributions of 11562 spontaneous, radiation- and chemical-induced forward mutations in the ad-3 region of heterokaryon 12 of Neurospora crassa. They were analyzed as large two-way contingency tables (CTs) where two kinds of profiles were compared: site (or genotypic class) profiles and origin (or mutagen) profiles. To measure similarity (homogeneity) between any pair of profiles, the relevant sufficient statistics, Kastenbaum-Hirotsu squared distance (KHi<sup>2</sup>), was used. Collapsing the similar profiles into distinct internally homogeneous clusters named 'collapsets' revealed their similarity pattern. To facilitate the procedure, the computer program, COLLAPSE, was elaborated. The results of SPAN for the lacI spectra were found comparable with the results of their previous analysis with two multivariate statistical methods, the factor and cluster analyses. In the ad-3 data set, five collapsets were revealed among origin profiles (OPs): (I) ENU=4NQO=4HAQO=FANFT=SQ18506; (II) AF-2=EI=MMS=DEP; (III) ETO=UV; (IV) AHA=PROCARB; and (V) He ions=protons. Moreover, the previous observation that MDs are dose-dependent was confirmed for X-ray-induced MDs. Profiles induced with the low doses of X-rays are similar to that induced with <sup>85</sup>Sr, and profiles induced with the medium X-ray doses to those induced with protons and He ions. Evaluated similarities appear to be rather reasonable: mutagens with similar mode of action induce similar MDs. Similarity pattern revealed among genotypic class profiles (GCPs) seems to be also interpretable. When supplemented with descriptive cluster analysis, SPAN appears to be a fruitful methodology in MS analysis. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
2291,"Overview of results of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 3 radiolabeled somatostatin analogs A new treatment modality for inoperable or metastasized gastroenteropancreatic tumors is the use of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs. Initial studies with high doses of [(111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)(0)]octreotide in patients with metastasized neuroendocrine tumors were encouraging, although partial remissions were uncommon. Another radiolabeled somatostatin analog that is used for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is [(90)Y-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide. Various phase 1 and phase 2 PRRT trials have been performed with this compound. Despite differences in the protocols used, complete and partial remissions in most of the studies with [(90)Y-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide were in the same ranges, 10%-30%; these ranges were higher than those obtained with [(111)In-DTPA(0)]octreotide. Treatment with the newest radiolabeled somatostatin analog, [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate, which has a higher affinity for the subtype 2 somatostatin receptor, resulted in complete or partial remissions in 30% of 76 patients. Tumor regression was positively correlated with a high level of uptake on OctreoScan imaging, a limited hepatic tumor mass, and a high Karnofsky performance score. Treatment with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs is a promising new tool in the management of patients with inoperable or metastasized neuroendocrine tumors. Symptomatic improvement may occur with all (111)In-, (90)Y-, or (177)Lu-labeled somatostatin analogs that have been used for PRRT. The results obtained with [(90)Y-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide and [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate are very encouraging in terms of tumor regression. Also, if kidney protective agents are used, the side effects of this therapy are few and mild, and the duration of the therapy response for both radiopharmaceuticals is more than 2 y. These data compare favorably with those for the limited number of alternative treatment approaches. [References: 19]",Excluded
1563,"Fission reactor neutron sources for neutron capture therapy--a critical review The status of fission reactor-based neutron beams for neutron capture therapy (NCT) is reviewed critically. Epithermal neutron beams, which are favored for treatment of deep-seated tumors, have been constructed or are under construction at a number of reactors worldwide. Some of the most recently constructed epithermal neutron beams approach the theoretical optimum for beam purity. Of these higher quality beams, at least one is suitable for use in high through-put routine therapy. It is concluded that reactor-based epithermal neutron beams with near optimum characteristics are currently available and more can be constructed at existing reactors. Suitable reactors include relatively low power reactors using the core directly as a source of neutrons or a fission converter if core neutrons are difficult to access. Thermal neutron beams for NCT studies with small animals or for shallow tumor treatments, with near optimum properties have been available at reactors for many years. Additional high quality thermal beams can also be constructed at existing reactors or at new, small reactors. Furthermore, it should be possible to design and construct new low power reactors specifically for NCT, which meet all requirements for routine therapy and which are based on proven and highly safe reactor technology.

Therefore, we analyzed the outcome and toxicity of SRS alone compared to SRS in combination with TT/IT.METHODS: Patients with MBM treated with single session SRS at our department between 2014 and 2017 with a minimum follow-up of 3 months after first SRS were included. The primary endpoint of this study was local control (LC). Secondary endpoints were distant intracranial control, radiation necrosis-free survival (RNFS), and overall survival (OS). The local/ distant intracranial control rates, RNFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to test differences between groups. Cox proportional hazard model was performed for univariate continuous variables and multivariate analyses.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (17 male and 11 female) with 52 SRS-lesions were included. The median follow-up was 19 months (range 14-24 months) after first SRS. Thirty-six lesions (69.2%) were treated with TT/IT simultaneously (4 weeks before and 4 weeks after SRS), while 16 lesions (30.8%) were treated with SRS alone or with sequential TT/IT. The 1-year local control rate was 100 and 83.3% for SRS with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.023), respectively. The estimated 1-year RNFS was 90.0 and 82.1% for SRS in combination with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.935). The distant intracranial control rate after 1 year was 47.7 and 50% for SRS in combination with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.933). On univariate analysis, the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment including the BRAF status (Melanoma-molGPA) was associated with a significantly improved LC. Neither gender nor SRS-PTV margin had a prognostic impact on LC.

Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 595 NSCLC BM patients treated consecutively at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between 2013 to 2015. We assigned the patients into 4 dose groups of WBRT: none, < 30, 30-39, and >= 40 Gy and assessed their relationship with OS and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS). Cox models were utilized. Covariates included sex, age, KPS, BM lesions, extracranial metastasis, BM and lung tumor resection, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and focal radiotherapy modalities. Result(s): Patients had a mean age of 59 years and were 44% female. Their median survival time (MST) of OS and iPFS were 9.3 and 8.9 months. Patients receiving none (344/58%), < 30 (30/5%), 30-39 (93/16%), and >= 40 (128/22%) Gy of WBRT had MST of OS (iPFS) of 7.3 (6.8), 6.0 (5.4), 10.3 (11.9) and 11.9 (11.9) months, respectively. Compared to none, other WBRT groups had adjusted HRs for OS - 1.23 (p > 0.20), 0.72 (0.08), 0.61 (< 0.00) and iPFS - 1.63 (0.03), 0.71 (0.06), 0.67 (< 0.01).

Radiation effects on this cytokine network have not yet been elucidated. We investigated the effect of gamma-irradiation on microglia stimulated with Zymosan A and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which alone induce the expression of some cytokines and neurotoxic products by microglial cells. In the resting condition (ramified microglia), radiation had no effect on the mRNA level corresponding to cytokines such as IL1beta or IL-6, although TGF-beta1 mRNA was minimally enhanced by irradiation. However, in the activated microglia (amoeboid microglia) stimulated with Zymosan A, radiation-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was increased about two-fold in comparison with non-irradiation. IL-1beta was slightly induced by 2 Gy irradiation, but was not induced by higher doses. TGF-beta1 mRNA was not enhanced by radiation following Zymosan stimulation. In the LPS-stimulated condition, IL-6 mRNA was induced only by 2 Gy of irradiation, but no change in the expression of other genes was detected. These results suggested that radiation exerted different effects on cytokine gene transcription in microglia depending on their morphological state.",Included

Previously we had shown that the increased chromosome aberrations in ATM and NBS defective lines was due to a significantly larger quadratic dose-response term compared to normal fibroblasts for both simple and complex exchanges. The linear dose-response term for simple exchanges was significantly higher in NBS cells compared to wild type cells, but not for AT cells. However, AT cells have a high background level of exchanges compared to wild type or NBS cells that confounds the understanding of low dose responses. To understand the sensitivity differences for high to low doses, chromosomal aberration analysis was first performed at low dose-rates (0.5Gy/d), and results provided further evidence for the lack of sensitivity for exchanges in AT cells below doses of 1Gy. Normal lung fibroblast cells treated with KU-55933, a specific ATM kinase inhibitor, showed increased numbers of exchanges at a dose of 1Gy and higher, but were similar to wild type cells at 0.5Gy or below. These results were confirmed using siRNA knockdown of ATM. The present study provides evidence that the increased radiation sensitivity of AT cells for chromosomal exchanges found at high dose does not occur at low dose.",Excluded
1777,"Mutagenesis at the ad-3A and ad-3B loci in haploid UV-sensitive strains of Neurospora crassa. V. Comparison of dose--response curves of single- and double-mutant strains with wild-type The interactions of mutant alleles that individually confer radiation sensitivity in Neurospora crassa are being studied with regard to their effects on radiation-induced inactivation and forward-mutation induction at the ad-3 loci. This paper reports attempts to construct 3 double-mutant strains containing the following pair-wise combinations of repair-deficient mutants: upr-1,uvs-2; uvs-2,uvs-6; and uvs-3,uvs-6. The double-mutant strain with the 2 excision-repair-deficient mutants upr-1 and uvs-2 shows increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced mutagenesis and inactivation, relative to that shown by either of the parental single-mutant strains. This double mutant is no more sensitive than the parental single-mutant strains to either UV mutagenesis or inactivation. The combination of the uvs-2 and uvs-6 double-mutant strain is considerably more sensitive to both UV and X-ray inactivation than either the uvs-2 or uvs-6 strain, but it shows no greater sensitivity than the parental strains to ad-3 mutation induction by either agent. The combination of the uvs-3 and uvs-6 alleles is inviable. Tetrad analysis and microscopical examination of ascospores shows that ascospores of presumptive genotype uvs-3, uvs-6 do not grow beyond the formation of a few hyphal threads. The lethal and mutagenic effects of UV and X-irradiation in these double-mutant strains are interpreted in terms of the repair systems in Neurospora and other microorganisms.",Excluded
2295,"[Problems and chances of high field magnetic resonance imaging]. [German] The spatial, temporal and spectral resolution in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is in many cases currently not sufficient to detect submillimeter lesions or to image the dynamics of the beating heart. At present MRI systems at 1.5 T and 3 T are the standard units for clinical imaging. The use of ultrahigh magnetic fields of 7 T and higher increases the signal-to-noise ratio, which holds promise for a significant improvement of the spatial and/or temporal resolution as well as for new contrast mechanisms. With 7 T MRI, images of the brain have been acquired routinely with a spatial resolution of 0.3 mm. The theoretical improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio is often not fully realized due to B1 inhomogeneities and contrast variations. With MRI at 7 T a notable increase in spatial resolution can be achieved. Methods such as time-of-flight MR angiography and susceptibility-weighted imaging (e.g. neurofunctional MRI, fMRI) profit especially from the higher field strengths. Transmission field inhomogeneities are still a major challenge for ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI and are also a partially unsolved safety problem. The use of UHF MRI is currently limited to special applications and the expected gain of the high field must be weighed against technical limitations in both image acquisition and interpretation.",Excluded
1427,"Protection against focal cerebral ischemia following exposure to a pulsed electromagnetic field There is evidence that electromagnetic stimulation may accelerate the healing of tissue damage following ischemia. We undertook this study to investigate the effects of low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) exposure on cerebral injury in a rabbit model of transient focal ischemia (2 h occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion). PEMF exposure (280 V, 75 Hz, IGEA Stimulator) was initiated 10 min after the onset of ischemia and continued throughout reperfusion (six exposed, six controls). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology were used to measure the degree of ischemic injury. Exposure to pulsed electromagnetic field attenuated cortical ischemia edema on MRI at the most anterior coronal level by 65% (P < 0.001). On histologic examination, PEMF exposure reduced ischemic neuronal damage in this same cortical area by 69% (P < 0.01) and by 43% (P < 0.05) in the striatum. Preliminary data suggest that exposure to a PEMF of short duration may have implications for the treatment of acute stroke.",Excluded
1683,"Qualitative assessment of intra-arterial cone beam CT angiography in precise anatomic localisation and treatment planning of intracranial and spinal arteriovenous fistulas Background and Purpose Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is considered the standard for characterisation of intracranial/spinal arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Although DSA offers superior spatial and temporal resolution, it is limited by 2D planar imaging. We directly paralleled DSA and intra-arterial cone-beam CT angiography (IACBCTA) modalities to assess the relative IACBCTA efficacy in the anatomical identification/localisation of AVFs and utility for surgical/endovascular treatment planning. Materials and Methods Patients with intracranial/spinal AVFs underwent biplane DSA and IACBCTA procedures (AXIOMArtis FlatDetector Biplane-Angiosuite, Siemens) at two institutions with identical contrast injection, radiation exposure, and postprocessing techniques. Images were reviewed retrospectively and independently by two neurointerventionalists on a de-identified PACS workstation. Observers were blinded to clinical information and reviewed both DSA and IACBCTA images in tandem, obtained from the same IA injection. Qualitative image analysis was performed based on the level of delineation on a scale of 1-3 (3: Excellent/Good with minimal attenuation; 2: Moderate, relevant visibility with restrictions; 1: Poor, nondiagnostic). The following parameters were scored: a) Arterial feeders, b) Venous drainers and course, c) Fistula site, d) Adjacent anatomical landmarks for cross-sectional localisation, and e) Overall diagnostic value for interpretation. Differences between the scores were defined as the IACBCTA efficacy value. For evaluation of IACBTA treatment planning efficacy, observers described the treatment strategy at the end of DSA and IACBCTA grading respectively and scored its adjunctive value: altered or more confident treatment plan versus no value. Wilcoxon signed rank test compared scores of image quality parameters. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Kendall W coefficient of concordance. Results Thirty-two consecutive patients [22M/10F, mean age 60.9 +/- 12.4 years (29-83 years)] were studied. Intracranial AVFs were classified as Cognard type I (n=3), type II (n=11), type III (n=3), type IV (n=1) and metameric dural/pial (n=5). Spinal AVFs were limited to Anson-Spetzler type I (n=9). Interobserver agreement of overall diagnostic value for IACBCTA was good (K = 0.59, P=0.001) while it was fair for IACBCTA overall efficacy value (K = 0.32, P=0.046); however, no significant difference was observed between two observers' IACBCTA efficacy values (P=0.3). Both observers assigned significantly higher scores to IACBCTA for overall diagnostic value (both observers: P<0.0001). No significant differences were observed between DSA and IACBCTA scores while evaluating arterial feeders (observer 1: P=1.0, observer 2: P=0.5) or venous drainers (observer 1: P=0.08, observer 2: P=0.1). Both readers assigned significantly higher scores to IACBCTA when evaluating the fistula site (observer 1: P <0.0001, observer 2: P=0.0003) and adjacent anatomic landmarks/cross-sectional localisation (both observers: P<0.0001). In 30/32 cases, both observers noted that IACBCTA did not alter the treatment plan; but provided a more confident endovascular or surgical treatment approach. Both observers altered their treatment plan from an endovascular approach to microsurgery in one case based on IACBCTA. Conclusion IACBCTA adjunctively improves the anatomical delineation of AVFs, particularly in terms of fistula site and localisation; biplane DSA may be equally sensitive for arterial feeder and venous drainer identification. IACBCTA confers a more confident endovascular or surgical approach when performed in conjunction with DSA.",Excluded

1462,"Differential radiosensitivity of neurons and neuroglia of the hippocampus in the adult rabbit Adult rabbits were subjected to 4.5 Gy of whole-blody or brain alone gamma-irradiation, and their hippocampus was examined with the light and electron microscope. Pycnotic cells were found at the base of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in the so-called subgranular zone, as soon as 3 h after irradiation, and were cleared up by active phagocytosis after 48 h. Some of these cells appeared as undifferentiated, whereas others were differentiating granule cells, and possibly immature neuroglia. The extent of cell necrosis was contingent upon the age of the animal, the oldest animal studied (27 months) showing only sparse lesion of that type. Astrocytes and microglia were responsible for the phagocytosis of dead cells. Another type of lesion was found in the nuclei of the mature granule cells and consisted of light spots which appeared 1 h after the irradiation and disappeared almost completely after 48 h. Pyramidal cells did not show any of these two lesions. It is concluded that the laterations in the electrical activity of pyrimidal cells, following irradiation, are at least partly due to lesions affecting the dentate gyrus. Radionecrosis in the subgranular zone is related to the presence of immature cells in this region.",Included

2037,"Impacts of Microgravity Analogs to Spaceflight on Cerebral Autoregulation It is well known that exposure to microgravity in astronauts leads to a plethora physiological responses such as headward fluid shift, body unloading, and cardiovascular deconditioning. When astronauts return to Earth, some encounter problems related to orthostatic intolerance. An impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA), which could be compromised by the effects of microgravity, has been proposed as one of the mechanisms responsible for orthostatic intolerance. CA is a homeostatic mechanism that maintains cerebral blood flow for any variations in cerebral perfusion pressure by adapting the vascular tone and cerebral vessel diameter. The ground-based models of microgravity are useful tools for determining the gravitational impact of spaceflight on human body. The head-down tilt bed rest (HDTBR), where the subject remains in supine position at -6 degrees for periods ranging from few days to several weeks is the most commonly used ground-based model of microgravity for cardiovascular deconditioning. head-down bed rest (HDBR) is able to replicate cephalic fluid shift, immobilization, confinement, and inactivity. Dry immersion (DI) model is another approach where the subject remains immersed in thermoneutral water covered with an elastic waterproof fabric separating the subject from the water. Regarding DI, this analog imitates absence of any supporting structure for the body, centralization of body fluids, immobilization and hypokinesia observed during spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of microgravity on CA. Here, we review the fundamental principles and the different mechanisms involved in CA. We also consider the different approaches in order to assess CA. Finally, we focus on the effects of short- and long-term spaceflight on CA and compare these findings with two specific analogs to microgravity: HDBR and DI.",Excluded

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13) patients carrying dominant-negative mutations in Kcnc3 and Kcnc3-null mutant mice both display motor incoordination, suggested in mice by increased lateral deviation while ambulating and slips on a narrow beam. Motor skill learning, however, is spared. Mice lacking Kcnc3 also exhibit muscle twitches. In addition to broadened spikes, recordings of Kcnc3-null Purkinje cells revealed fewer spikelets in complex spikes and a lower intraburst frequency. Targeted reexpression of Kv3.3 channels exclusively in Purkinje cells in Kcnc3-null mice as well as in mice also heterozygous for Kv3.1 sufficed to restore simple spike brevity along with normal complex spikes and to rescue specifically coordination. Therefore, spike parameters requiring Kv3.3 function in Purkinje cells are involved in the ataxic null phenotype and motor coordination, but not motor learning.",Excluded
1457,"Prospective trial evaluating difference in radiation target volume on 3T versus 1.5T mr for patients with malignant gliomas Purpose/Objective(s): It is hypothesized that there is a difference in the peritumoral and tumor related signal abnormality detected by 1.5 tesla (T) versus 3T T2 FLAIR magnet resonance imaging (MRIs). We assessed the difference in radiation treatment gross tumor volumes (GTVs) defined by four investigators for high-grade gliomas as determined using 1.5T vs. 3T MRIs. Materials/Methods: A total of 23 patients with newly diagnosed, high grade-gliomas were enrolled in this IRB approved prospective trial. All patients underwent a 1.5T and 3T MR scans within a 24-hour period, with no treatment or steroid dose change between scans. The 1.5T study was part of the clinical standard of care and hence was the MR imaging with intravenous gadolinium administration and was used for radiation treatment planning. Gadolinium was not given at 3T imaging. The imaging parameters for T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were those that are clinically employed at this institution. Image processing and radiation planning was performed using radiation oncology software. MRIs were fused by a designated physicist and were reviewed by a radiation oncologist. GTV delineation was independently performed by 4 experienced investigators: 2 radiation oncologists and 2 neurosurgeons. To decrease inherent biases, investigators contoured 1.5T and 3T MRs separately, with a minimum of 72 hours between contours, blinded to other contours. GTV was defined by the extent of peritumoral edema depicted by high T2 FLAIR signal abnormality. For each patient and investigator the volumes defined by FLAIR images at 1.5 and 3T were determined and the ratio of the volumes (GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup>) were calculated. The mean volume ratios were calculated for each investigator as well as an overall average. To assess the consistency of contours from investigator to investigator, the standard deviations and range of the volumes amongst all investigators were determined for each patient at each field strength. Result(s): The volumes ratios for each investigator (GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup>) were 0.86 +/- 0.20 (range, 0.37-1.03), 0.90 +/- 0.20 (range, 0.19-1.08), 0.94 +/- 0.18 (range, 0.37-1.14), and 0.98 +/- 0.14 (range, 0.66-1.18). One patient was clearly an outlier, with 3T volumes 0.19 to 0.66 that of the 1.5T volumes. The overall GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup>ratio was 0.95 +/- 0.19. Excluding the outlier produced an overall GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup> ratio 0.94 +/- 0.13 (range, 0.57-1.18). The 1.5T studies produced less variability from investigator to investigator. Thirty-nine percent of contoured volumes were different by greater than 10%. Conclusion(s): At this institution, it was found that flair defined GTVs for high grade gliomas were on average smaller that at 3T. There was increased volume variability on 3T MR.",Excluded
1950,"Predictors of hearing preservation after stereotactic radiosurgery for acoustic neuroma OBJECT: Many patients with acoustic neuromas (ANs) have hearing function at diagnosis and desire to maintain it. To date, radiosurgical techniques have been focused on conformal irradiation of the tumor mass, with less attention to inner ear structures for which there was scant radiobiological information. The authors of this study evaluated tumor control and hearing preservation as they relate to tumor volume, imaging characteristics, and nerve and cochlear radiation dose following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using the Gamma Knife.METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with ANs had serviceable hearing (Gardner-Robertson [GR] Class I or II) and underwent SRS between 2004 and 2007. This interval reflected more recent measurements of inner ear dosimetry during the authors' 21-year experience. The median patient age was 52 years (range 22-82 years). No patient had undergone any prior treatment for the ANs. The median tumor volume was 0.75 cm(3) (range 0.07-7.7 cm(3)), and the median radiation dose to the tumor margin was 12.5 Gy (range 12-13 Gy). At diagnosis, a greater distance from the lateral tumor to the end of the internal auditory canal correlated with better hearing function.RESULTS: At a median of 20 months after SRS, no patient required any other additional treatment. Serviceable hearing was preserved in 71% of all patients and in 89% (46 patients) of those with GR Class I hearing. Significant prognostic factors for maintaining the same GR class included (all pre-SRS) GR Class I hearing, a speech discrimination score (SDS) >or= 80%, a pure tone average (PTA) < 20 dB, and a patient age < 60 years. Significant prognostic factors for serviceable hearing preservation were (all pre-SRS) GR Class I hearing, an SDS >or= 80%, a PTA < 20 dB, a patient age < 60 years, an intracanalicular tumor location, and a tumor volume < 0.75 cm(3). Patients who received a radiation dose of < 4.2 Gy to the central cochlea had significantly better hearing preservation of the same GR class. Twelve of 12 patients < 60 years of age who had received a cochlear dose < 4.2 Gy retained serviceable hearing at 2 years post-SRS.CONCLUSIONS: As currently practiced, SRS with the Gamma Knife preserves serviceable hearing in the majority of patients. Tumor volume and anatomy relate to the hearing level before radiosurgery and influence technique. A low radiosurgical dose to the cochlea enhances hearing preservation.",Excluded

Re-irradiation with concomitant bevacizumab represents an option. Retrospectively, we analyzed a cohort of heavily pretreated patients (n = 14) with relapsing HGGs who underwent re-irradiation with conventional 3D-conformal or intensified modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Ten of them received re-irradiation in combination with bevacizumab. The study population consisted of eight GBMs and six anaplastic gliomas. All patients had previously undergone irradiation for first-line therapy, including seven patients with radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. Patients without contraindications started with two infusions of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg of body weight every other week) prior to re-irradiation and continued through re-irradiation until progression. The median patient age was 45 years with a median Karnofsky performance scale of 70. The median dose of re-irradiation was 41.6 Gy [39-55 Gy]. The median physical cumulative radiation dose was 101.6 Gy [65-110.4 Gy]. The median PFS from re-irradiation was 5.1 months [1.6-17.4] based on clinical and RANO criteria.

Although widely considered a safe and effective therapy, RAI has been associated with elevated risks of total and site-specific cancer death among patients with hyperthyroidism. Objective(s): To determine whether greater organ- or tissue-absorbed doses from RAI treatment are associated with overall and site-specific cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study is a 24-year extension of the multicenter Cooperative Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Follow-up Study, which has followed up US and UK patients diagnosed and treated for hyperthyroidism for nearly 7 decades, beginning in 1946. Patients were traced using records from the National Death Index, Social Security Administration, and other resources. After exclusions, 18805 patients who were treated with RAI and had no history of cancer at the time of the first treatment were eligible for the current analysis. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100-mGy dose to the organ or tissue were calculated using multivariable-adjusted linear dose-response models and were converted to relative risks (RR = 1 + ERR). The current analyses were conducted from April 28, 2017, to January 30, 2019. Exposures: Mean total administered activity of sodium iodide I 131 was 375 MBq for patients with Graves disease and 653 MBq for patients with toxic nodular goiter. Mean organ or tissue dose estimates ranged from 20 to 99 mGy (colon or rectum, ovary, uterus, prostate, bladder, and brain/central nervous system), to 100 to 400 mGy (pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, female breast, lung, oral mucosa, and marrow), to 1.6 Gy (esophagus), and to 130 Gy (thyroid gland). Main Outcomes and Measures: Site-specific and all solid-cancer mortality. Result(s): A total of 18805 patients were included in the study cohort, and the mean (SD) entry age was 49 (14) years. Most patients were women (14671 [78.0%]), and most had a Graves disease diagnosis (17615 [93.7%]). Statistically significant positive associations were observed for all solid cancer mortality (n = 1984; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P =.002), including female breast cancer (n = 291; RR at 100-mGy dose to the breast = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.003-1.32; P =.04) and all other solid cancers combined (n = 1693; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P =.01). The 100-mGy dose to the stomach and breast corresponded to a mean (SD) administered activity of 243 (35) MBq and 266 (58) MBq in patients with Graves disease. For every 1000 patients with hyperthyroidism receiving typical doses to the stomach (150 to 250 mGy), an estimated lifetime excess of 19 (95% CI, 3-40) to 32 (95% CI, 5-66) solid cancer deaths could occur. Conclusions and Relevance: In RAI-treated patients with hyperthyroidism, greater organ-absorbed doses appeared to be modestly positively associated with risk of death from solid cancer, including breast cancer. Additional studies are needed of the risks and advantages of all major treatment options available to patients with hyperthyroidism. Copyright © 2019 American Medical Association.

2158,"Lipid alteration following proton beam irradiation in mouse brain of radiation necrosis model INTRODUCTION: Brain radiation necrosis (RN) is irreversible severe adverse effect after radiation therapy for brain tumors over 60 Gy. Effective treatment for this irreversible event has not been established. The lying mechanism of RN is to be elucidated in order to establish a new therapy. We have established brain RN mouse model using proton beam at the Wakasa Wan Energy research Center. In this model, RN was induced 8 months after irradiation and the histology of the necrosis recapitulated the human RN patients [Kondo N.2015]. So far, some researchers investigated the mechanism of RN based on protein level. However, with the advanced mass spectrometry technology, lipid mediator response to ionizing radiation was reported [Laiakis EC, 2014]. Therefore, in this study, lipid alteration after proton beam irradiation was investigated in mouse brain RN model using high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizing imaging mass spectrometry (HR-MALDI-IMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Generation of mouse brain RN model: C57BL/6J mice were irradiated in the restricted area of right brain at 60 Gy using proton beam. Tissue preparation: After 4 months later mouse was sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with cold PBS. The brain was extracted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in-80degreeC. The brain was sliced to a thickness of 4 mum with a cryostat and placed onto an indium tin oxide coated glass slide and stored at-20 degreeC until matrix application and subsequent HR-MALDI-IMS analysis. Each slide was anchored in vacuum deposition equipment and coated with 9-aminoacridine hemihydrates (9-AA) matrix layer obtained by sublimation at 220degreeC. The sequential sections were mounted onto glass slides for hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) staining. HR-MALDI-IMS analysis: HR-MALDI-IMS analysis was performed on a high-resolution microscopic imaging mass spectrometer (iMScope; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectrometry data were acquired in negative and positive mode in the mass range of m/z 700-1000. Statistical Analysis: Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed by Imaging MS Solution (ver 1, 12, 26; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). RESULT(S): Compared to non-irradiated area, in the irradiated right hemisphere, i) elevation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (34:1, 36:4, 36:1, 38:6, 40:6) and ii) decline of phosphatidylinositol (PI) (36:4, 38:4) were detected. CONCLUSION(S): The data indicated the phospholipid alterations after irradiation in mouse brain RN model in the chronic phase before establishment of RN. Further analysis for component of these phospholipids may include the precursor of lipid mediator, arachidonic acid (AA) or other fatty acids.

The XP90TO and XP92TO fibroblasts exhibited the typical XPF characteristics of a threefold higher sensitivity to the lethal effect of 254 nm UV and a reduced level of 12% unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) compared with normal cells. Clinically, both patients manifested moderate to severe acute sun sensitivity by age 8, pigmented freckles by age 10 and skin malignancies at higher ages (6 basaliomas at 42 years in XP90TO; 1 basalioma at 41 years in XP92TO).

Application of therapeutic doses of neurotropin 3 months after radiation levelled the pattern of chronic radiation stress and diencephalic disorders that underlie disturbances of some systemic functions of the organism.",Included
1929,"Localization dependent sensitivity of cerebral Na,K-ATPase to irradiation induced oxidative imbalance in rats Na,K-ATPase represents the key enzyme maintaining the ionic gradient across plasma membrane. It was documented that in directly irradiated organs the activity of this enzyme is decreased. The aim of present study was to clarify the remote effect of irradiation in mediastinal area on the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in selected brain regions in rats. Ionizing radiation in single dose 25 Gy induced alterations in oxidative status of blood plasma. Irradiation also decreased the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in cerebral cortex. Measurements of kinetic properties of the enzyme dependently on the concentration of energy substrate ATP or cofactor Na<sup>+</sup> indicated that the lowered enzyme activity is probably a consequence of decreased number of active molecules of the enzyme, as suggested by lowered V<sub>max</sub> values (by 13 - 14%). Immunoblot analysis revealed that this effect is connected namely to decreased presence of alpha2 and alpha3 subunits (by 25% and 30% respectively). Considering the current concepts about involvement of the malfunction of alpha2 alpha3 subunits in development of primary brain dysfunctions, it may be hypothesized that the lowered functionality of those subunits of Na,K-ATPase may represent a predisposition to neurodegenerative disorders after irradiation. The observed effect seems to be localization dependent as the enzyme in cerebellum resisted to irradiation.",Included
1998,"Risk Factor Analysis for Newly Developed Urogenital Dysfunction after Total Mesorectal Excision and Impact of Pelvic Intraoperative Neuromonitoring-a Prospective 2-Year Follow-Up Study AIM: Urogenital dysfunction is a common sequela following total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. This prospective study analyzed potential risk factors and investigated the impact of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring.METHOD: Included were 85 patients undergoing total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, 43 under the control of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring. Urogenital function was assessed with validated questionnaires within a 2-year follow-up period. Potential risk factors were identified by multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Overall, approximately one-third of treated patients suffered from new onset of urinary dysfunction. Initially, half of the sexually active patients were affected by sexual dysfunction; after 2 years, almost three quarters were affected. In the pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring group, urinary and sexual dysfunction rates including minor and major disturbances were significantly lower (2-year follow-up 20% vs. 51% (p = 0.004) and 56% vs. 90% (p = 0.010)). Throughout the survey, non-performance of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring was found to be an independent risk factor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was identified as an independent predictor for urogenital dysfunction in the further course one and 2 years after surgery.CONCLUSION: Pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with significantly lower rates of urinary and sexual dysfunction in the short and long run, whereas neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has a negative impact only in the long run.",Excluded

1559,"Experimental glutamatergic excitotoxicity in rabbit retinal ganglion cells: block by memantine PURPOSE: Excessive activity of NMDA-type (N-methyl-d-aspartate) glutamatergic channels has been implicated as a mechanism for neuronal injury in neurologic disorders, including glaucoma, and retinal disease. This study was designed to characterize the retinal response to experimental manipulations that mimic features of glutamatergic excitotoxic insult and also to determine whether memantine, an NMDA-type glutamatergic channel blocker, is effective in reversing experimental excitotoxicity.METHODS: Recordings of the electroretinogram (ERG) and spiking activity of single retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were made from rabbit retinas. Excitotoxic insult was induced by either (1) application of NMDA, a selective NMDA receptor agonist; (2) application of TBOA (dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid), a selective inhibitor of glutamate transporters, or (3) perfusion with magnesium-free medium. For each condition, memantine was coapplied to determine its efficacy for reversal of experimental excitotoxicity. Memantine was also applied in isolation to characterize any effect on retinal responses to light stimuli.RESULTS: All three experimental manipulations were associated with an increase in the tonic level of RGC spiking activity, a reduction in RGC spike amplitude, and, in some cells, block of spike generation. Experimental excitotoxicity had little or no effect on ERG responses. Coapplication of memantine was associated with recovery of RGC tonic spiking activity and spike amplitude toward control levels. Application of memantine in isolation was associated with a dose-dependent effect on the timing of ERG and RGC-OFF responses.CONCLUSIONS: Memantine was effective in reversing acute experimental excitotoxicity at concentrations that have little effect on retinal light signaling.",Excluded

Because the laser is a form of nonionizing radiation, therapy can be repeated as often as needed. Two male patients, 50 and 55 years old, were referred to our clinic because of severe dyspnea and massive hemoptysis, the first 3 years ago and the second 1.5 years ago. In his medical history, the former patient had a thoracotomy for thymoma resection 5 years ago. Rigid bronchoscopy was performed under general anesthesia, Nd:YAP (neodymium-yttrium, aluminum, pevroskite) laser resection and silicon stent insertion were carried out for an endobronchial mass that was almost completely obliterating the left main bronchus. During the next 2 years, the same procedure was repeated 6 times to prevent distal tracheal obliteration. The left lung has now been totally collapsed for 2 years and the patient is still alive and healthy. The latter was a patient with a centrally located nonsmall cell lung cancer invading the middle and lower trachea, right main and upper lobe bronchi causing near-total obstruction. Rigid bronchoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. Nd:YAP laser coagulation and mechanical resection were carried out and a Dumon ""Y"" stent was inserted. In 1.5 years, therapeutic bronchoscopy was repeated 6 times. The patient is alive without dyspnea or respiratory insufficiency, although with brain metastases.

1995,"Fail-Safe Therapy by Gamma-Ray Irradiation Against Tumor Formation by Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Progenitors Cell replacement therapy holds great promise for Parkinson's disease (PD), but residual undifferentiated cells and immature neural progenitors in the therapy may cause tumor formation. Although cell sorting could effectively exclude these proliferative cells, from the viewpoint of clinical application, there exists no adequate coping strategy in the case of their contamination. In this study, we analyzed a component of proliferative cells in the grafts of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors and investigated the effect of radiation therapy on tumor formation. In our differentiating protocol, analyses of neural progenitors (day 19) revealed that the proliferating cells expressed early neural markers (SOX1, PAX6) or a dopaminergic neuron progenitor marker (FOXA2). When grafted into the rat striatum, these immature neurons gradually became postmitotic in the brain, and the rosette structures disappeared at 14 weeks. However, at 4-8 weeks, the SOX1(+)PAX6(+) cells formed rosette structures in the grafts, suggesting their tumorigenic potential. Therefore, to develop a fail-safe therapy against tumor formation, we investigated the effect of radiation therapy. At 4 weeks posttransplantation, when KI67(+) cells comprised the highest ratio, radiation therapy with (137)Cs Gammacell Exactor for tumor-bearing immunodeficient rats showed a significant decrease in graft volume and percentage of SOX1(+)KI67(+) cells in the graft, thus demonstrating the preventive effect of gamma-ray irradiation against tumorigenicity.

1681,"Rapid separation and quantitation of combined neutral and polar lipid classes by high-performance liquid chromatography and evaporative light-scattering mass detection Modifications are described for an innovative and widely used high-performance liquid chromatography technique that resolves a very broad spectrum of lipids for quantitation by evaporative light-scattering detection. Substitution of acetone for 2-propanol in a portion of the solvent gradient program yields consistent resolution of diacylglycerol and cholesterol without sacrificing baseline resolution of the remaining major lipid classes. Moreover, previously noted instabilities in triacylglycerol retention time are eliminated. The introduction of acetone also enables a 20% reduction in flow-rate without an increase in total run time. As a further modification of the mobile phase composition, acetic acid and ethanolamine are substituted for the serine-ethylamine combination that was originally shown to improve column performance. The combination of acetic acid and ethanolamine yields the same result but the increased volatility of these solutes over serine results in decreased baseline noise. Finally, 1,2-hexadecanediol is introduced as an internal standard that is well suited for this method. The chromatographic performance obtained with these modifications is demonstrated in compositional analyses of lipid extracts from rat liver, heart, kidney and brain.",Excluded
2058,"The Treatment of Melanoma Brain Metastases Melanoma is the malignancy with the highest rate of dissemination to the central nervous system once it metastasizes. Until recently, the prognosis of patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM) was poor. In recent years, however, the prognosis has improved due to high-resolution imaging that facilitates early detection of small asymptomatic brain metastases and early intervention with local modalities such as stereotactic radiosurgery. More recently, a number of systemic therapies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for metastatic melanoma, resulting in improved survival for many MBM patients. Registration trials for these newer therapies excluded patients with untreated brain metastases, and a number of studies specifically tailored to this population of patients have been conducted or are underway. Herein, we review contemporary locoregional and systemic therapies and describe the unique challenges posed by treatment of brain metastases, such as radionecrosis, cerebral edema, and pseudoprogression. Since the number of systemic and combined modality clinical trials has increased, we expect that the treatment landscape for patients with melanoma brain metastasis will change dramatically. In addition to ongoing clinical trials, which show great promise, we conclude that our understanding of intracranial metastasis remains quite limited. In addition to inter-disciplinary, multi-modality studies, bench-side work to better understand the process of cerebrotropism is needed to fuel more drug development and further improve outcomes.

1481,"Disease-related microstructural differences in the brain in females with localized provoked vulvodynia Localized provoked vulvodynia (LPVD) affects almost 15% of females and is characterized by localized sensitivity of the vulvar vestibule. Very little research has been performed to characterize central abnormalities in LPVD using neuroimaging. The few studies that are available indicate that neural alterations may play a causal role in symptom generation or are secondary responses to the chronic pain condition. The aim of the study was to utilize diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to identify unique microstructural differences in the brain. We compare LPVD to HCs to assess whether alterations in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), which are measures of cohesive axonal orientation and tissue compactness, are specific to pain, and with IBS to determine distinct or shared mechanisms with another chronic pelvic-pain disorder. Structural and DTI MRIs were conducted in a sample of 58 age-matched premenopausal females. FA and MD were processed using the FMBRIB Diffusion Toolbox. Voxelwise and ICBM atlas based region of interest analyses were performed using pairwise t-tests with age as a covariate. LPVD vs. HC: Patients with LPVD demonstrated significantly higher FA in brainstem regions including the left superior cerebellar peduncle as well as the medial lemniscus. There were also higher FA values in frontal lobe connections, right internal capsule, right corona radii, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, and primary sensory and motor regions. Higher MD was observed within the cingulum bundle and left anterior limb of internal capsule. LPVD vs. IBS: FA and MD differences between LPVD and IBS patients were less extensive and only localized to regions near the right posterior corona radiata and left posterior thalamic radiation. The significant group-related microstructural differences in deep gray matter structures included regions that are associated with sensorimotor tasks and cognitive-emotional tasks, suggesting increased processing and modulation of sensory and endogenous pain modulatory systems in LPVD.",Excluded
1515,"Wirelessly powered endoscopically implantable devices into the submucosa as the possible treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a rather common disease with a prevalence reaching up to 10 or 20% in the western world. The most specific symptoms which point to the diagnosis of GERD are feelings of heartburn and the regurgitation of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus. However, a certain number of patients do not respond to standard therapy, and in these cases, it is necessary to resort to other treatment methods, such as laparoscopic fundoplication or electrostimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter. The aim of our work was to design and manufacture a miniature, battery-less stimulator to provide electric stimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter, which could be implanted deep into the submucosa of the distal esophagus. The main goal was to provide a battery-less system as opposed to traditional battery neurostimulators to reduce the size and weight of the device. An electronic prototype of a wirelessly powered implantable device was developed. We used animal models for the experiments. The device is designed to treat GERD via electrical stimulation of the muscularis propria. It is implanted into the submucosal pocket by the lower esophageal sphincter with an endoscope. This method of implantation is superior to esophageal stimulators used today because of very low invasiveness of the surgery. Bipolar neurostimulation via two gold-plated leads is provided. The device does not have any source of energy; it is powered wirelessly which reduces the risk of potential battery leakage and reduces the overall dimensions. Copyright © 2019 J. Hajer et al.

1459,"Fractionated radiosurgery for painful spinal metastases: DOSIS - a phase II trial BACKGROUND: One third of all cancer patients will develop bone metastases and the vertebral column is involved in approximately 70% of these patients. Conventional radiotherapy with of 1-10 fractions and total doses of 8-30 Gy is the current standard for painful vertebral metastases; however, the median pain response is short with 3-6 months and local tumor control is limited with these rather low irradiation doses. Recent advances in radiotherapy technology - intensity modulated radiotherapy for generation of highly conformal dose distributions and image-guidance for precise treatment delivery - have made dose-escalated radiosurgery of spinal metastases possible and early results of pain and local tumor control are promising. The current study will investigate efficacy and safety of radiosurgery for painful vertebral metastases and three characteristics will distinguish this study. 1) A prognostic score for overall survival will be used for selection of patients with longer life expectancy to allow for analysis of long-term efficacy and safety. 2) Fractionated radiosurgery will be performed with the number of treatment fractions adjusted to either good (10 fractions) or intermediate (5 fractions) life expectancy. Fractionation will allow inclusion of tumors immediately abutting the spinal cord due to higher biological effective doses at the tumor - spinal cord interface compared to single fraction treatment. 3) Dose intensification will be performed in the involved parts of the vertebrae only, while uninvolved parts are treated with conventional doses using the simultaneous integrated boost concept.METHODS / DESIGN: It is the study hypothesis that hypo-fractionated image-guided radiosurgery significantly improves pain relief compared to historic data of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Primary endpoint is pain response 3 months after radiosurgery, which is defined as pain reduction of >= 2 points at the treated vertebral site on the 0 to 10 Visual Analogue Scale. 60 patients will be included into this two-centre phase II trial.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study will refine the methods of patient selection, target volume definition, treatment planning and delivery as well as quality assurance for radiosurgery.

1722,"Opposite effects of tetanic stimulation of the auditory thalamus or auditory cortex on the acoustic startle reflex in awake rats The amygdala mediates both emotional learning and fear potentiation of startle. The lateral amygdala nucleus (LA) receives auditory inputs from both the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus; MGN) and auditory association cortex (AAC), and is critical for auditory fear conditioning. The central amygdala nucleus, which has intra-amygdaloid connections with LA, enhances startle magnitude via midbrain connections to the startle circuits. Tetanic stimulation of either MGN or AAC in vitro or in vivo can induce long-term potentiation in LA. In the present study, behavioural consequences of tetanization of these auditory afferents were investigated in awake rats. The acoustic startle reflex of rats was enhanced by tetanic stimulation of MGN, but suppressed by that of AAC. All the tetanization-induced changes of startle diminished within 24 h. Blockade of GABAB receptors in the LA area reversed the suppressive effect of tetanic stimulation of AAC on startle but did not change the enhancing effect of tetanic stimulation of MGN. Moreover, transient electrical stimulation of MGN enhanced the acoustic startle reflex when it lagged behind acoustic stimulation, but inhibited the acoustic startle reflex when it preceded acoustic stimulation. The results of the present study indicate that MGN and AAC afferents to LA play different roles in emotional modulation of startle, and AAC afferents are more influenced by inhibitory GABAB transmission in LA.",Excluded
1857,"Irradiation induces glioblastoma cell senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and fatal primary brain tumors in humans. The standard therapy for the treatment of GBM is surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. However, the frequency of tumor recurrence in GBM patients is very high, and the survival rate remains poor. Delineating the mechanisms of GBM recurrence is essential for therapeutic advances. Here, we demonstrate that irradiation rendered 17-20 % of GBM cells dead, but resulted in 60-80 % of GBM cells growth-arrested with increases in senescence markers, such as senescence-associated beta-galactosidase-positive cells, H3K9me3-positive cells, and p53-p21(CIP1)-positive cells. Moreover, irradiation induced expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) mRNAs and NFkappaB transcriptional activity in GBM cells. Strikingly, compared to injection of non-irradiated GBM cells into immune-deficient mice, the co-injection of irradiated and non-irradiated GBM cells resulted in faster growth of tumors with the histological features of human GBM. Taken together, our findings suggest that the increases in senescent cells and SASP in GBM cells after irradiation is likely one of main reasons for tumor recurrence in post-radiotherapy GBM patients.",Excluded

1628,"Normal tissue contour variation and the dosimetric impact on radiation therapy treatment planning Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate how variability in contouring normal tissues affects dose assessment for radiation therapy treatment planning. Materials/Methods: Computed tomography (CT) scans of individual patients treated for tumors of the brain, head and neck, thorax, pancreas and prostate were selected for this study. For each scan, a radiation oncologist, who primarily treats the disease site and a diagnostic radiologist, outlined the normal tissues (""gold"" contours) using RTOG guidelines. A total of 27 organs were delineated. Independently, five board-certified dosimetrists and one trainee then outlined the same set of contours on the individual scans. A radiation treatment plan was calculated for each of the disease sites based on PTVs, gold contours and doses defined by the physician. Dose-volume constraints were defined per RTOG protocol criteria for each disease site. Result(s): For the 27 gold organs contoured, a total of 156 organs were outlined by dosimetrists. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for each dosimetrist drawn organ and compared with the gold contours. Of the 34 dosimetric endpoints that were evaluated, 56% of the organs had dosimetric parameters that agreed to within 10% of those obtained by the gold contours. Maximum and mean dose variation for the dosimetrist's contours that were greater than 10% when compared to the dose of the gold contours were reviewed. Organs with the highest variation in dose were the optic lens maximum dose (45%) and the mandible maximum dose (40%). Moderate variation was seen for the mean left parotid gland dose (15%) and the cervical spinal cord (13%). When evaluating the prostate plan, the V80Gy, V75Gy and V65Gy for the bladder and the V70Gy and V50Gy for the rectum were obtained. Minimal variation was observed in the absolute volumes at each dose level, however the relative variation was larger (10-25%). This difference is due to the small volume of the organs receiving these doses and was determined not to be clinically relevant. Conclusion(s): The results of this study demonstrated that the normal tissue contours produced by our dosimetrists showed good dosimetric agreement with the gold contours for over half of the organs evaluated. For the remaining organs, our expectation is that the establishment of contouring competencies will ensure more accurate treatments and dose assessment in radiotherapy treatment planning and delivery.",Excluded
1749,"Variability in EMF permittivity values: implications for SAR calculations Digital anatomical models of man and animals are available for use in numerical calculations to predict electromagnetic field (EMF)-induced specific absorption rate (SAR) values. To use these models, permittivity values are assigned to the various tissues for the EMF frequencies of interest. There is, as yet, no consensus on what are the best permittivity data. This study analyzed the variability in published permittivity data and investigated the effects of permittivity values that are proportional on SAR calculations. Whole-sphere averaged and localized SAR values along the diameter of a 4-cm sphere are calculated for EMF exposures in the radio frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 GHz. When the dimensions of a sphere are small compared to the wavelength (i.e., wavelength inside the material is greater than ten times the dimensions of the object), the whole-sphere averaged SAR is inversely proportional to the permittivity of the material composing the sphere. However, the localized SAR values generally do not have the same relation and, as a matter of fact, vary greatly depending on the location within the sphere. These results indicate that care must be taken in choosing the permittivity values used in calculating SAR values and some estimate of the dependence of the calculated SAR values on variability in permittivity should be determined.",Excluded
1483,"Radiation Induced Metabolic Alterations Associate With Tumor Aggressiveness and Poor Outcome in Glioblastoma Glioblastoma (GBM) is uniformly fatal with a 1-year median survival, despite best available treatment, including radiotherapy (RT). Impacts of prior RT on tumor recurrence are poorly understood but may increase tumor aggressiveness. Metabolic changes have been investigated in radiation-induced brain injury; however, the tumor-promoting effect following prior radiation is lacking. Since RT is vital to GBM management, we quantified tumor-promoting effects of prior RT on patient-derived intracranial GBM xenografts and characterized metabolic alterations associated with the protumorigenic microenvironment. Human xenografts (GBM143) were implanted into nude mice 24 hrs following 20 Gy cranial radiation vs. sham animals. Tumors in pre-radiated mice were more proliferative and more infiltrative, yielding faster mortality (p < 0.0001). Histologic evaluation of tumor associated macrophage/microglia (TAMs) revealed cells with a more fully activated ameboid morphology in pre-radiated animals. Microdialyzates from radiated brain at the margin of tumor infiltration contralateral to the site of implantation were analyzed by unsupervised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In pre-radiated animals, metabolites known to be associated with tumor progression (i.e., modified nucleotides and polyols) were identified. Whole-tissue metabolomic analysis of pre-radiated brain microenvironment for metabolic alterations in a separate cohort of nude mice using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR revealed a significant decrease in levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC)), NAD<sup>+</sup>, Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates, and rise in energy carriers (ATP, GTP). GSH and ASC showed highest Variable Importance on Projection prediction (VIPpred) (1.65) in Orthogonal Partial least square Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA); Ascorbate catabolism was identified by GC-MS. To assess longevity of radiation effects, we compared survival with implantation occurring 2 months vs. 24 hrs following radiation, finding worse survival in animals implanted at 2 months. These radiation-induced alterations are consistent with a chronic disease-like microenvironment characterized by reduced levels of antioxidants and NAD<sup>+</sup>, and elevated extracellular ATP and GTP serving as chemoattractants, promoting cell motility and vesicular secretion with decreased levels of GSH and ASC exacerbating oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest IR induces tumor-permissive changes in the microenvironment with metabolomic alterations that may facilitate tumor aggressiveness with important implications for recurrent glioblastoma. Harnessing these metabolomic insights may provide opportunities to attenuate RT-associated aggressiveness of recurrent GBM.",Excluded

Although the presence of an antimitotic effect of TTFs has been widely reported, the efficacy of TTFs is still controversial issue among medical experts. To resolve this controversial issue, the comparison study between the effects of TTFs and the effect of other conventional cancer treatment techniques need to be carried out. In this study, experimental evidence of the synergistic antimitotic effect of TTFs in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) is reported. For these experiments, aggressive brain cancer cells, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (U373 and U87), were treated either with TTFs alone, with IR alone or with TTFs followed by ionizing radiation (IR). The percentages of cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and mitotic abnormalities were increased by the application of TTFs alone and its quantity was markedly increased when TTFs were combined with IR.

The spleens of irradiated mice were removed aseptically and the splenocytes were extracted from the individual spleens and cultured. The micronuclei were prepared 72 hours after irradiation in binucleate splenocytes by blocking cytokinesis with cytochalasin-B. Irradiation of mice resulted in a dose-dependent elevation in the micronucleated splenocytes. The exposure of mice not only elevated splenocytes bearing one micronucleus but also cells bearing 2 and multiple (>2) micronuclei indicating induction of complex DNA damage after irradiation. Oral treatment of mice with 50 mg/kg body weight of jamun leaf extract protected against the radiation-induced micronuclei formation. Jamun extract also protected against the formation of 2 and multiple micronuclei indicating repair or inhibition of complex DNA damage. The assessment of lipid peroxidation in mice brain homogenate has indicated a concentration dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation by jamun extract. Studies in a cell free system revealed that jamun extract inhibited the formation of OH, O(2)-, DPPH, and ABTS(+) free radicals in a concentration dependent manner.

Result(s): The mean time from diagnosis to radiosurgery was 10 months (range, 1 to 36), from radiosurgery to death, 8.0 months (range, 1 to 23). Twenty-one GBM (81%) and six AA (67%) patients have died. The actuarial survival time for all patients was 21 months from diagnosis and 8 months from radiosurgery. Twenty-two of 26 patients (85%) died of local or marginal failure, three (12%) of noncontiguous failure, and one (4%) of CSF dissemination. Age (P = .0405) was associated with improved survival on multivariate analysis, and age (P = .0110) and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (P = .0285) on univariate analysis. Histology, treatment volume, and treatment dose were not significant variables by univariate analysis. Seven patients required surgical resection for increasing mass effect a mean of 4.0 months after radiosurgery, for an actuarial reoperation rate of 31%. Surgery did not significantly influence survival. At surgery, four patients had recurrent tumor, two had radiation necrosis, and one had both tumor and necrosis. The actuarial necrosis rate was 14% and the pathologic findings could have been predicted by the integrated logistic formula for developing symptomatic brain injury. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery appears to proofing survival for recurrent malignant gliomas and has a lower reoperative rate for symptomatic necrosis than does brachytherapy. Patterns of failure are similar for both of these techniques.",Excluded
2131,"Changes in intracortical circuits of the human motor cortex following theta burst stimulation of the lateral cerebellum OBJECTIVE: The cerebellum takes part in several motor functions through its influence on the motor cortex (M1). Here, we applied the theta burst stimulation (TBS) protocol, a novel form of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) over the lateral cerebellum. The aim of this study was to test whether TBS of the lateral cerebellum could be able to modulate the excitability of the contralateral M1 in healthy subjects.METHODS: Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) amplitude, short intracortical inhibition (SICI), long intracortical inhibition (LICI) and short intracortical facilitation (SICF) were tested in the M1 before and after cerebellar continuous TBS (cTBS) or intermittent TBS (iTBS).RESULTS: We found that cTBS induced a reduction of SICI and an increase of LICI. On the other hand, cerebellar iTBS reduced LICI. MEPs amplitude also differently vary following cerebellar stimulation with cTBS or iTBS, resulting in a decrease by the former and an increase by the latter.CONCLUSIONS: Although the interpretation of these data remains highly speculative, these findings reveal that the cerebellar cortex undergoes bidirectional plastic changes that modulate different intracortical circuits within the contralateral primary motor cortex.SIGNIFICANCE: Long-lasting modifications of these pathways could be useful to treat various pathological conditions characterized by an altered cortical excitability.",Excluded

2198,"Detection of abasic sites and oxidative DNA base damage using an ELISA-like assay Reactive oxygen species produce a wide spectrum of DNA damage, including oxidative base damage and abasic (AP) sites. Many procedures are available for the quantification and detection of base damage and AP sites. However, either these procedures are laborious or the starting materials are difficult to obtain. A biotinylated aldehyde-specific reagent, ARP, has been shown to react specifically with the aldehyde group present in AP sites, resulting in biotin-tagged AP sites in DNA. The biotin-tagged AP sites can then be determined colorimetrically with an ELISA-like assay, using avidin/biotin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase as the indicator enzyme. The ARP assay is thus a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the detection of AP sites in DNA. Furthermore, removal of damaged base by DNA N-glycosylases generates AP sites that can be measured by the ARP reagent. By coupling the ARP assay with either endonuclease III from Escherichia coli or 8-oxoguanine N-glycosylase (OGG1) from yeast, investigators can rapidly determine the amount of oxidative pyrimidine damage (endonuclease III-sensitive sites) or purine damage (OGG1-sensitive sites) in cellular DNA, respectively. An increased levei of oxidative damage has been implicated in several age-related human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease, as well as the aging process. The sensitivity and simplicity of the ARP assay thus make it a valuable method for investigators who are interested in estimating the level of oxidative DNA damage in cells and tissues derived from patients with various age-related diseases or cancers. © 2000 Academic Press.",Excluded
2073,"Mechanisms of radiation-induced brain toxicity and implications for future clinical trials Radiation therapy is widely used in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors and metastatic tumors of the brain with either curative or palliative intent. The limitation of cancer radiation therapy does not derive from the inability to ablate tumor, but rather to do so without excessively damaging the patient. Among the varieties of radiation-induced brain toxicities, it is the late delayed effects that lead to severe and irreversible neurological consequences. Following radiation exposure, late delayed effects within the CNS have been attributable to both parenchymal and vascular damage involving oligodendrocytes, neural progenitors, and endothelial cells. These reflect a dynamic process involving radiation-induced death of target cells and subsequent secondary reactive neuroinflammatory processes that are believed to lead to selective cell loss, tissue damage, and functional deficits. The progressive, late delayed damage to the brain after high-dose radiation is thought to be caused by radiation-induced long-lived free radicals, reactive oxygen species, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Experimental studies suggest that radiation-induced brain injury can be successfully mitigated and treated with several well established drugs in wide clinical use which exert their effects by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This review highlights preclinical and early clinical data that are translatable for future clinical trials. [References: 85]",Excluded
2345,"Repair and mutagenesis at oxidized DNA lesions in the developing brain of wild-type and Ogg1-/- mice OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1) is one of the main DNA glycosylases present in mammalian cells. The enzyme removes 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions, believed to be the most important oxidized lesions due to their relatively high incidence and their miscoding properties. This study shows that in prenatal mice brains the repair capacity for 8-oxoG is 5-10-fold higher than in adult mice brains. Western blot analysis and repair activity in extracts from Ogg1(-/-) mice revealed that OGG1 was responsible for the efficient 8-oxoG removal from prenatal mice. To investigate how OGG1 protects against oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis, pregnant Big Blue/wild-type and Big Blue/Ogg1(-/-) mice were exposed to nontoxic doses of gamma radiation. A 2.5-fold increase in the mutation frequency in Ogg1(-/-) mouse brains was obtained by exposure to 3.5 Gy at day 19 postfertilization. This was largely due to GC to TA transversions, believed to originate from 8-oxoG mispairing with A during replication. Furthermore, rapid cell divisions seemed to be required for fixation of mutations, as a similar dose of radiation did not increase the mutation frequency, or the frequency of GC to TA transversion, in the adult brain.",Excluded
1824,"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. [German] Hyperbaric oxygenation is defined as the administration of 100% oxygen in a compression chamber at an ambient pressure greater than one atmosphere absolute. The increased pressure (up to three atmospheres) induces a 10- to 15-fold plasma oxygen concentration resulting in increased tissue oxygenation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the bactericidal capacity of leukocytes, stimulates important mechanisms in wound healing, reduces tissue oedema and maintains tissue oxygenation even in the absence of haemoglobin. Commonly accepted indications supported by scientific evidence include the decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, severe carbon monoxide poisoning, delayed radiation injury, clostridial myonecrosis and also the improvement of healing of vulnerable skin or soft tissue grafts. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is also used in healing difficulties of specific problem wounds, extreme blood loss, intracranial abscesses, necrotizing soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, crush syndrome, burns and sudden deafness. Since hyperbaric oxygenation involves the administration of oxygen in a pharmacological dose, side effects are possible due to barotrauma and oxygen toxicity. During hyperbaric oxygen therapy, an increased amount of oxygen-free radicals may be generated, depending on the duration and extent of pressure elevation during treatment. Although many different organ systems may be affected, the brain is of greatest clinical significance. Neurotoxicity is manifested by visual disturbances, auditory hallucinations, nausea, facial twitching, irritability, dizziness and convulsion.",Excluded
1933,"Tryptophan pet has a strong prognostic value in post-treatment high-grade gliomas BACKGROUND: MRI has limited prognostic value in patients with previously treated high-grade gliomas. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with alpha[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT), a radiotracer tracking tryptophan transport and metabolism via the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway, can accurately differentiate glioma recurrence from radiation injury (J Nucl Med 2012;53:1058-64). We evaluated AMT uptake as a prognostic marker for survival in post-treatment patients with high-grade glioma. METHOD(S): AMT-PET was performed in 39 patients > 1 month (median: 325 days) after resection and chemoradiation of a grade III or IV astrocytic glioma. All patients were followed for at least 1 year or until death after PET. Maximum standardized uptake values (AMT-SUVmax) were measured in brain regions suspicious for tumor on MRI. Unidirectional AMT uptake (K) was also quantified from dynamic PETand blood radioactivity data (available in 34 cases). Optimal cutoff thresholds for prediction of 1-year survival were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and survival of patients with above vs. below threshold values was evaluated in thewhole group, and in two subgroups (glioblastoma [n = 33], no further surgical or radiation treatment after PET [n = 22]). RESULT(S): For 1-year survival, sensitivity/specificity was 84%/80% for AMT-SUVmax and 76%/88% for lesion/cortex K-ratio, when using ROC-defined cutoff thresholds. Both AMT-SUVmax and K-ratio were highly prognostic for survival in all patient groups. Estimated median survival after PET was 966 and 876 days in the low, vs. 177 days in both the high AMT-SUVmax and high K-ratio groups, respectively (log-rank: p, > 001). Age- and gradecorrected Cox regression analyses showed a robust association between high AMT values and shorter overall survival after the PET scan (SUVmax: OR= 6.2 [2.2-17.5], K-ratio: OR= 6.6 [2.3-18.6]; p<= > 001). CONCLUSION(S): Focal increase of AMT uptake on PET has a strong prognostic value for 1-year and overall survival in patients with a previously treated high-grade glioma.",Excluded
2307,"TRESK is a key regulator of nocturnal suprachiasmatic nucleus dynamics and light adaptive responses The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a complex structure dependent upon multiple mechanisms to ensure rhythmic electrical activity that varies between day and night, to determine circadian adaptation and behaviours. SCN neurons are exposed to glutamate from multiple sources including from the retino-hypothalamic tract and from astrocytes. However, the mechanism preventing inappropriate post-synaptic glutamatergic effects is unexplored and unknown. Unexpectedly we discovered that TRESK, a calcium regulated two-pore potassium channel, plays a crucial role in this system. We propose that glutamate activates TRESK through NMDA and AMPA mediated calcium influx and calcineurin activation to then oppose further membrane depolarisation and rising intracellular calcium. Hence, in the absence of TRESK, glutamatergic activity is unregulated leading to membrane depolarisation, increased nocturnal SCN firing, inverted basal calcium levels and impaired sensitivity in light induced phase delays. Our data reveals TRESK plays an essential part in SCN regulatory mechanisms and light induced adaptive behaviours.",Excluded

Optimal management for older glioblastoma patients is unknown as they have not been extensively studied in clinical trials. We report data from a series of 156 consecutive glioblastoma patients treated at our institution from 2007 to 2017. Compared to glioblastoma patients aged 70 or less, the patients older than 70 were less likely to undergo surgical resection (34% vs. 64%; p = 0.0003), be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (37% vs. 59%; p = 0.01) or radiation therapy (36% vs. 56%; p = 0.03). Disease-specific survival was significantly shorter in this age group (4.7 vs. 15.3 months; p = 0.002). Nonetheless, when older patients did undergo surgery or chemotherapy, the proportional improvement in cancer-specific survival was similar to the one recorded in younger patients, which is concordant with the findings of other published reports. A multidisciplinary input from neurosurgeons, medical and radiation oncologists, oncology pharmacists and geriatricians remain paramount for the optimal management of glioblastoma in patients older than 70.

1882,"Reduction of Iba1-expressing microglial process density in the hippocampus following electroconvulsive shock Recent studies place emphasis on the modulations of immune system in various psychiatric disorders and/or treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the implications of immune-related glial cells in a rapid-acting treatment for depression, namely, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Specifically, the effects of electroconvulsive shock (ECS; animal model of ECT) on microglia were morphologically determined in the mouse hippocampus by using ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) immunocytochemistry. For comparison, S100beta-positive astrocytes, another type of glial cells, were also tested. After 24 hours of acute ECS administration, a meshwork of Iba1-positive microglial processes was largely diminished, although the change was transient. In mice that received chronic ECS administration, the decline of Iba1-positive microglial process meshwork continued even 1 month after the last shock. Morphometric image analysis revealed the significant reduction of Iba1-positive microglial process density following ECS administration. On the other hand, neither acute nor chronic ECS administration made alterations in the patterns of expression of S100beta immunoreactivity. No significant changes were detected in the cell surface area of S100beta-positive astrocytes following ECS administration. The optical disector analysis demonstrated that ECS did not affect the numerical densities of Iba1-positive microglia and S100beta-positive astrocytes in the hippocampus. These results provide some key to understand the potential role of microglia and astrocytes in the antidepressant action of ECT.",Excluded

2382,"Impact of brain metastasis velocity on neurologic death for brain metastasis patients experiencing distant brain failure after initial stereotactic radiosurgery PURPOSE: Patients with high rates of developing new brain metastases have an increased likelihood of dying of neurologic death. It is unclear, however, whether this risk is affected by treatment choice following failure of primary stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: From July 2000 to March 2017, 440 patients with brain metastasis were treated with SRS and progressed to have a distant brain failure (DBF). Eighty-seven patients were treated within the immunotherapy era. Brain metastasis velocity (BMV) was calculated for each patient. In general, the institutional philosophy for use of salvage SRS vs whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) was to postpone the use of WBRT for as long as possible and to treat with salvage SRS when feasible. No further treatment was reserved for patients with poor life expectancy and who were not expected to benefit from salvage treatment.RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five patients were treated with repeat SRS, 91 patients were treated with salvage WBRT, and 64 patients received no salvage radiation therapy. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death after salvage SRS vs WBRT was 15% vs 23% for the low- (p = 0.06), 30% vs 37% for the intermediate- (p < 0.01), and 31% vs 48% (p < 0.01) for the high-BMV group. Salvage WBRT was associated with increased incidence of neurologic death on multivariate analysis (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.39, p = 0.01) when compared to repeat SRS. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death for patients treated within the immunotherapy era was 9%, 38%, and 38% for low-, intermediate-, and high-BMV groups, respectively (p = 0.01).CONCLUSION: Intermediate and high risk BMV groups are predictive of neurologic death.

2256,"First-in-human phase 0 trial of oral 5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose (IPDR) in patients with advanced malignancies Background: Iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd or IUDR), a halogenated nucleoside analog, has produced responses in patients with high-grade anaplastic astrocytomas and sarcomas when administered as a radiosensitizer via continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion over the course of radiation therapy. Since continuous i.v. infusion is impractical for several weeks of radiotherapy, we conducted a phase 0 trial of IPdR, an oral prodrug of IdUrd, in patients (pts) with advanced malignances. Prior to embarking on large-scale clinical trials, our objective was to determine whether the oral route was a feasible alternative to continuous i.v. infusion. Plasma concentrations of IPdR, IdUrd, and other metabolites were measured after a single oral dose of IPdR. Trial design: Eligible pts had advanced refractory malignancies; age >=18 years; ECOG PS <= 2; adequate organ function; were at least 2 weeks from prior anticancer therapy. All pts verbalized their understanding of the non-therapeutic nature of the trial prior to signing the consent form. A single oral dose of IPdR was administered per pt; dose escalations were planned (150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, 1200 mg, 2400 mg) with one pt per dose level and 6 pts at the highest dose level. Blood sampling was performed over a 24-hour period for pharmacokinetic analysis. All pts were followed for 14 days for safety assessments. Significant toxicities were defined as grade >=2 non-hematologic toxicities; grade >=2 thrombocytopenia; grade >=3 anemia, leucopenia, or neutropenia. If one pt developed significant toxicity, no additional patients were to be enrolled. Result(s): There were no drug-related adverse events. Ten pts were enrolled; median age 60 yrs (range 45-66 yrs); M/F 8/2; diagnosis (# of pts): thyroid (2), lymphoma (1), neuroendocrine (1), hepatocellular (1), adenoid cystic (1), bladder (1), colorectal (2), breast cancer (1). A dosedependent increase in the plasma concentration was observed for IdUrd from 150 mg to 2400 mg. At the 2400 mg dose, all 6 pts achieved peak IdUrd levels of (mean+/-SD) 4.0+/-1.02mM (25% CV) at 1.67+/-1.21 h. Peak levels of iodouracil, the major metabolite, were 133+/-42mM at 3.3+/-1.0 h post IPdR administration. Conclusion(s): Single-dose oral IPdR was well tolerated, and adequate plasma levels were obtained to justify proceeding with a phase I trial of IPdR in combination with radiation.

Prospective sources or reactive oxygen species (ROS) include mitochondria and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2). We tested the causal role of Nox2 in unloading induced atrophy using a peptidyl inhibitor (gp91ds-tat) with the following groups: ambulatory controls (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 7 days with scrambled sequence (HUScr), and unloading for 7 days + 5 mg/kg/day gp91dsTAT (HUG). Nox2 inhibition provided significant against HU-induced reduction of plantarflexor muscle mass and soleus muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), measured using ImageJ and SMASH programs. There was a trend towards protection against a partial shift in fiber-type shift from slow to fast twitch. Loss of sarcolemmal nNOSmu activity with HU, visualized using NADPH diaphorase and confirmed with immunofluorescence were also mitigated by gp91dsTAT. Gp91dsTAT also attenuated membrane localization of the Nox2 subunit p67phox. We conclude that Nox2 inhibition protects against muscle fiber atrophy and translocation of nNOSmu.",Excluded

Conclusion(s): Although, in general, outcomes have been inconsistent and comparison between individual studies is difficult, enhanced electroencephalogram alpha-band power has been noted in several of the studies, a phenomenon also observed in some animal studies. Performance decrements observed in some recent extremely low frequency studies are consistent with enhanced alpha-band power, highlighting the possible role of extremely low frequency fields associated with battery current in mobile phone handsets. However, more complex cognitive tasks appear to show improved performance in relation to mobile phone exposure. Significant cognitive effects have been reported using both modulated and unmodulated radiofrequency carriers. The possibility of putative effects being due to extremely low frequency demodulation is therefore unlikely.

Microembolic signals (MES) have been associated with stroke and neurological impairment. However, the incidence of MES during PVAI, and their relationship to microbubble formation and radiofrequency (RF) parameters are unknown.OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the relationship between MES, microbubble detection, and neurological outcome and the impact of RF titration strategy on these parameters.METHODS: We studied 202 patients in two groups undergoing PVAI using an intracardiac echocardiography (ICE)-guided technique. MES were detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) using insonation of the middle cerebral arteries. The number of microbubbles on ICE were qualitatively labeled as FEW, MODERATE, and SHOWER. In group I (n = 107), RF output was titrated to avoid microbubble formation and in group II (n = 95), standard power-limited RF output was used.RESULTS: TCD detected MES in all 202 patients during PVAI with an average of 1,793 +/- 547 per patient; 90% were detected during left atrial ablation. Over 85% of MES occurred after microbubbles. Group I patients had significantly lower numbers of MES (1,015 +/- 438 per patient) compared to group II patients (2,250 +/- 864 per patient) (P < 0.05). Group II also had a 3.1% incidence of acute neurological complications versus 0.9% in group I (P = 0.10). Patients with clinical events had significantly higher numbers of MES. There were no significant correlations between RF power, temperature, or impedence and MES number.CONCLUSIONS: MES directly correlate to the amount of microbubble formation on ICE, and may result in cerebroembolic complications. Titration of RF according to microbubble formation by ICE during PVAI may be important for minimizing the occurrence of MES and possibly acute neurological complications.",Excluded

We used a non-dedicated set of resources to calculate detailed dose distributions, including doses to peripheral organs well outside of the primary field, in common rat exposure settings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a detailed dose reconstruction in a rat through an analog to the conventional human treatment planning process. The process consisted of: (i) Characterizing source properties of an X-ray irradiator system, (ii) acquiring a computed tomography (CT) scan of a rat model, and (iii) using a Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine to generate the dose distribution within the rat model. We considered cranial and liver irradiation scenarios where the rest of the body was protected by a lead shield. Organs of interest were the brain, liver and gonads. The study also included paired scenarios where the dose to adjacent, shielded rats was determined as a potential control for analysis of bystander effects.RESULTS: We established the precise doses and dose distributions delivered to the peripheral organs in single and paired rats. Mean doses to non-targeted organs in irradiated rats ranged from 0.03-0.1% of the reference platform dose. Mean doses to the adjacent rat peripheral organs were consistent to within 10% those of the directly irradiated rat.CONCLUSIONS: This work provided details of dose distributions in rat models under common irradiation conditions and established an effective scenario for delivering only scattered radiation consistent with that in a directly irradiated rat.",Excluded

Namely, stimulation of the pC1 neuronal cluster initiates unilateral wing extension and vibration of both sides, whereas stimulation of the pC2l cluster initiates only contralateral wing displays. In addition, stimulation of pC2l but not pC1 neurons induced abdominal bending and proboscis extension. Ca(2+) imaging of the pC1 cluster revealed periodic Ca(2+) rises, each corresponding to a turn of the male fly during courtship.

These cells contain different types of visual pigments, rhodopsin and cone visual pigments, respectively, but little is known about the molecular properties of cone visual pigments under physiological conditions, making it difficult to link the molecular properties of rhodopsin and cone visual pigments with the differences in photoresponse between rods and cones.

Rhodopsin exhibited greater Gt activation efficiencies than cone visual pigments. Especially, the Gt activation efficiency of mRh was about 2.5-fold greater than that of mG at 37 degreeC, which is consistent with our previous electrophysiological data of knock-in mice. Although the active state (Meta-II) was in equilibrium with inactive states (Meta-I and Meta-III), quantitative determination of Meta-II in the equilibrium showed that the Gt activation efficiency per Meta-II of bvRh was also greater than those of cG and mG. These results indicated that efficient Gt activation by rhodopsin, resulting from an optimized active state of rhodopsin, is one of the causes of the high amplification efficiency of rods.",Excluded

Significant progress has been made in recent years both in understanding the mechanisms of immune regulation in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as tumor-induced and host-mediated immunosuppression elicited by gliomas. In this review, after discussing the special requirements needed for the initiation and control of immune responses in the CNS, we focus on immunological phenomena observed in glioma patients, discuss different immunological approaches to attack glioma-associated target structures and touch on further strategies to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy of gliomas.

2130,"2MO Radiotherapy in cancer is associated with a deletion signature that contributes to poor patient outcomes Background: Diffuse gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumors that invariably relapse despite treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy. Treatment with alkylating chemotherapy can drive tumors to develop a hypermutator phenotype. In contrast, the genomic effects of radiation therapy (RT) remain unknown. Method(s): We analyzed the mutational spectra following treatment with ionizing radiation in sequencing data from 190 paired primary-recurrent gliomas from the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) dataset and 2249 post-treatment metastatic tumors from the Hartwig Medical Foundation. Result(s): We identified a significant increase in the burden of small deletions following radiation therapy that was independent of other factors. These novel deletions demonstrated distinct characteristics when compared to pre-existing deletions present prior to RT-treatment and deletions in RT-untreated tumors. Radiation therapy-acquired deletions were characterized by a larger deletion size (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=1.2e-02 and P=8e-11, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test), an increased distance to repetitive DNA elements (P<2.2e-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and a reduction in microhomology at breakpoints (P=3.2e-02, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These observations suggested that canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) was the preferred pathway for DNA double strand break repair of RT-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, radiotherapy resulted in frequent chromosomal deletions and significantly increased frequencies of CDKN2A homozygous deletions. Finally, a high burden of RT-associated deletions was associated with worse clinical outcomes (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=4.7e-02, HR=2.59 [95% CI: 1.01, 6.60] and P=2.5e-02, HR=1.43 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.94], respectively; multivariable Cox regression). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that effective repair of RT-induced DNA damage is detrimental to patient survival and that inhibiting c-NHEJ may be a viable strategy for improving the cancer-killing effect of radiotherapy. Taken together, the identified genomic scars as a result of radiation therapy reflect a more aggressive tumor with increased levels of resistance to follow up treatments.

1404,"Pion therapy at TRIUMF. Treatment results for astrocytoma grades 3 and 4: a pilot study At TRIUMF, (located on the University of B.C. Campus), 53 patients with supratentorial astrocytoma grades 3 and 4 were treated with pions between 1982 and 1985. A 3-dimensional spot-scanning treatment technique has proven to be practical. The accuracy of the beam alignment system used for treatment was reproducible daily within 2 mm. Low pion flux has hindered optimal beam shaping but this will soon be remedied as flux improves. The overall median survival observed (53 patients) is 262 days from date of first radiation treatment. Younger (less than 49 years) patients have significantly better survival than older (greater than 50 years) patients (p = 0.001). From a base line dose of 40 Gy photons whole brain and 17.5 Gy pion boost, doses were escalated to 33 Gy pions localised to the primary tumour and the median survival improved from 198 to 436 days. Survival curves for patients treated with localised pion techniques to doses above 30 Gy are significantly better than for those treated with schedules of pions mixed with photons (p = 0.04). It appears that optimal pion dose for brain tumours is 33 Gy minimum with a possible maximum of 36 Gy and doses delivered in 15 fractions in 3 weeks.

1780,"Re-evaluation of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited-stage small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matched analysis We attempted to re-evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) with more recent data. A total of 179 patients with LS-SCLC received radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy at our institution between 1998 and 2018. One hundred twenty-eight patients who achieved complete response (CR), good partial response (PR), and PR without progression for at least for one year after initial therapy were enrolled in this study. These patients were divided into a PCI group (group A, n=43), and a non-PCI group (group B, n=85). Survival outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. Because several background factors differed significantly between groups A and B, propensity score (PS) matching was performed as 1:1 match of the two groups. Finally, we analyzed 64 patients (group A/B=32/32). Median follow-up periods were 53 and 31 months in groups A and B, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups' backgrounds. Two-year overall survival (OS) rates were 77% in group A and 62% in group B (p=0.224). Two-year brain metastasis free survival (BMFS) rates were 85% in group A and 57% in group B (p=0.008). The number of patients who underwent a brain imaging test for confirmation of no brain metastasis (BM) after radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy (before PCI) was 84 (group A/B=32/52). A PS matched analysis for cases of pre-PCI brain imaging group, two-year OS rates for group A/B were 73/59% (p=0.446). Two-year BMFS rates for group A/B were 91/52% (p=0.021). Retrospectively, PS matched analysis revealed that adding PCI to LS-SCLC patients who achieved good thoracic control significantly improved BMFS, but OS did not improve.

1991,"Set-up uncertainties: online correction with X-ray volume imaging AIM: To determine interfractional three-dimensional set-up errors using X-ray volumetric imaging (XVI).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2007 and August 2009, 125 patients were taken up for image-guided radiotherapy using online XVI. After matching of reference and acquired volume view images, set-up errors in three translation directions were recorded and corrected online before treatment each day. Mean displacements, population systematic (SIGMA), and random (sigma) errors were calculated and analyzed using SPSS (v16) software. Optimum clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin was calculated using Van Herk's (2.5SIGMA + 0.7 sigma) and Stroom's (2SIGMA + 0.7 sigma) formula.RESULTS: Patients were grouped in 4 cohorts, namely brain, head and neck, thorax, and abdomen-pelvis. The mean vector displacement recorded were 0.18 cm, 0.15 cm, 0.36 cm, and 0.35 cm for brain, head and neck, thorax, and abdomen-pelvis, respectively. Analysis of individual mean set-up errors revealed good agreement with the proposed 0.3 cm isotropic margins for brain and 0.5 cm isotropic margins for head-neck. Similarly, 0.5 cm circumferential and 1 cm craniocaudal proposed margins were in agreement with thorax and abdomen-pelvic cases.CONCLUSION: The calculated mean displacements were well within CTV-PTV margin estimates of Van Herk (90% population coverage to minimum 95% prescribed dose) and Stroom (99% target volume coverage by 95% prescribed dose). Employing these individualized margins in a particular cohort ensure comparable target coverage as described in literature, which is further improved if XVI-aided set-up error detection and correction is used before treatment.",Excluded

2021,"Eleven-Year Results Of Interstitial HDRBT APBI After BCS For Low-Risk Breast Cancer Purpose or Objective The role of APBI for patients with low-risk breast cancer has gained popularity as an alternative to the conventional whole breast irradiation (WBI) with external beam radiation. Multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy with flexible catheters located around the lumpectomy cavity is one of the oldest APBI techniques with the longest experience. The aim of the study was to report the results of 218 patients with at least 5-year follow-up treated with APBI using interstitial multicatheter high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) after breast-conserving surgery. Material and Methods From July 2006 to October 2017, 443 women with lowrisk invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ after BCS underwent APBI using interstitial multicatheter HDR brachytherapy at our department. In the analyzed group, 218 patients were followed up for 5 years or longer. The inclusion criteria were: ZUBROD 0 or 1, age <sup>3</sup>50 years, T1-2N0M0, T<=3cm, unifocally, invasive carcinoma without neuroinvasion, angioinvasion, minimal surgical margin 2mm or DCIS with minimal margin at least 5mm, without EIC (extensive intraductal component), positive estrogen receptors. The time between surgery and HDR-BT was more than 12 weeks. 78% of the analyzed patients underwent APBI under local anesthesia. The total dose was 32Gy in 8 fractions delivered twice-daily with a minimum 6-hour break. The primary endpoint was local recurrence. Results The median age was 62 years (range 47-86 years). All patients completed treatment without interruptions. There were no serious complications during the procedure. In 18% of the patients a hematoma following catheter insertion was noticed, which typically resolved within 2 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated. Near 2% of the patients developed local inflammation, requiring oral antibiotic therapy. In almost 20% of cases, prophylactic antibiotic therapy was applied. PTV range was 17.1-175cm<sup>3</sup>. The median D10 and D2 for the lungs were 29.4% and 38.1% reference dose, respectively. The median skin dose was 43.7% reference dose (range 17- 68%). The median PTV<inf>100</inf> was 95%, DHI 0.68 and COIN 0.69. The median follow-up for 218 patients was 87 months (range 61-133 months). There were no late serious complications. In the group of 218 patient we found 4 failures (1.83%), including 3 local recurrences and one case of distant metastases.

2176,"Phenomenology of spatial illusory reactions under conditions of weightlessness Sensory interaction and sensory adaptation in short- and long-lasting space flights (SF) and the dynamics of stability of adaptive shifts were studied by the phenomenology of spontaneous and visually induced illusory reactions. It was shown that perceptive impairment developed during the initial adaptation to microgravity should be considered regular reactions of sensory systems under given environmental conditions rather than special features of the individuals examined. The classification of spontaneous illusory reactions (SIR) under conditions of microgravity and the results of investigation of the vertical vection (vection is a visual illusion evoked by the optokinetic stimulation) are presented. The following previously unknown phenomena were registered for the first time: inversion of the vertical vection illusion (VVI) evoked by vertical and sinusoidal optokinetic stimulation, impairment of perception of the body schema during VVI, change in the character of VVI, and development of VVI asymmetry. During long-lasting existence under conditions of weightlessness the anomalous perceptive reactions continued to be registered episodically (the period of adaptation was replaced by that of deadaptation). A hypothesis was suggested for the possible mechanisms of the phenomena found. [Translated from Fiziologiya Cheloveka, vol. 21, no. 4, p. 50-62, July-August, 1995]",Excluded
1474,"Sleep loss, circadian mismatch, and abnormalities in reorienting of attention in night workers with shift work disorder STUDY OBJECTIVES: Permanent night-shift workers may develop shift-work disorder (SWD). In the current study, we evaluated neurophysiological and behavioral indices of distractibility across times prior to the night shift (T1), during night hours (T2), and after acute sleep deprivation (T3) in permanent hospital night workers with and without SWD.METHODS: Ten asymptomatic night workers (NW) and 18 NW with SWD participated in a 25-h sleep deprivation study. Circadian phase was evaluated by dim-light salivary melatonin onset (DLMO). Objective sleepiness was evaluated using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Electrophysiological distractibility was evaluated by brain event-related potentials (ERP), whereas behavioral distractibility was evaluated by performance on a visual task in an auditory-visual distraction paradigm.STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Comparisons of ERP results were performed by repeated-measures analysis of variance, and t-tests were used where appropriate. A Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of variables (MLST, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and DLMO) that deviated from normal.RESULTS: First, in the SWD group, the reorienting negativity ERP amplitude was significantly attenuated compared to that in the NW group. Second, the SWD group had shorter MSLT during night shift hours (4.8 +/- 4.9 min) compared to that in NW (7.8 +/- 3.7 min; U = 47; z = -2.1; P < 0.03). Third, NW with SWD had a DLMO at 20:27 +/- 5.0 h, whereas healthy NW had a DLMO at 05:00 +/- 3.4 h (U = 43.5; z = -2.22, P < 0.03). Finally, acute sleep deprivation impaired behavioral performance and the P3a ERP in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate specific deficits in neurophysiological activity in the attentional domain among the shift-work disorder group relative to night workers.",Excluded
1234,"[Carbon-11 labeled diacylglycerol for signal transduction imaging: effect of the solubilizer on the distribution and radiation dosimetry] Carbon-11 labeled diacylglycerol (11C-DAG) has been developed as a signal transduction imaging agent for the CNS, and it can visualize the second messenger. For clinical application by positron CT (PET), the 11C-DAG solution must be prepared for intravenous injection. However, the 11C-DAG does not dissolve in water because of its lipophilicity and requires a solubilizer such as human serum albumin (HSA) and Tween 80 (TW-80). We examined the influence of these solubilizers on the tissue distribution of 11C-DAG, and estimated the radiation dosimetry. In the brain, uptake of 11C-DAG dissolved with HSA was 1.3-1.8 times higher than that of dissolved with TW-80. On the other hand, the lung and spleen showed a higher uptake of 11C-DAG using TW-80 than when using HSA. Especially, the lungs showed 20-40 times higher uptake than when using HSA. Also, the washout of radioactivity from tissue was slower, and the dose of radiation exposure was estimated to be higher, with TW-80 than with HSA. Therefore, between TW-80 and HSA with different solubilizing mechanisms, the later was suggested to be a better solubilizer of 11C-DAG.",Excluded

Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x ""positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined.RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.",Included

A common manifestation of the disease is diabetes insipidus even in the absence of neural involvement. Disseminated disease often involves the central nervous system, but only six isolated lesions in the infundibulum have been reported. Case report: An 18-year-old male had failed to develop secondary sexual characteristics. He also had diabetes insipidus for more than 1 year. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a 1-cm homogeneously enhancing mass in the region of the infundibulum. No other lesions were found in other organ systems. The patient underwent an orbitozygomatic osteotomy and pterional craniotomy. The lesion, which was adherent to the infundibulum, was partially resected. Microscopic analysis showed multiple lymphocytes and eosinophils with Langerhans cells that stained positive for S-100. Langerhans cell histiocytosis was diagnosed, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6 with no neurological deficits. His diabetes insipidus persisted, and he underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy to the sellar region. Conclusion(s): Isolated Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the infundibulum is rare. The usual presentation is hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and diabetes insipidus. Patients with diabetes insipidus of unknown origin should undergo MRI of the sellar region to rule out infundibular abnormalities. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",Excluded
1834,"Analysis of occupational radiation exposure during cerebral angiography utilizing a new real time radiation dose monitoring system BACKGROUND: Thermoluminescent dosimeter badges currently utilized to monitor occupational radiation exposures are limited in their ability to provide timely feedback, restricting workers' ability to identify unnecessary exposure. New real time radiation monitoring systems provide an opportunity for workers to immediately identify and alter problematic behaviors in the neuroangiography suite, decreasing unnecessary exposures, lowering risk, and maximizing safety efforts.METHODS: Real time radiation monitoring was performed for 120 diagnostic cerebral angiography procedures. Data were collected in two phases, for procedures performed by two physician participants (30 procedures per physician per phase). Workers were blinded to their real time dose in phase I, and unblinded in phase II. Individual exposures (Sv) and the incidence of red events (exposure rates >=2.0 mSv/h) were collected for each assigned participating role (physician A, physician B, nurse, scrubbed technologist, and circulating technologist). The dose area product was collected for each procedure to standardize against variations in procedure duration or intensity.RESULTS: In phase II, significant decreased radiation exposure was observed for all roles except physician A. Physician B decreased most from 24.3x10(-8) to 6.9x10(-8) Sv/Gy-cm(2) (p<0.0001).

1518,"Early effects of whole-body (56)Fe irradiation on hippocampal function in C57BL/6J mice Relatively little is known about early irradiation effects on hippocampal function in wild-type mice. In this study, the effects of (56)Fe irradiation on hippocampal function were assessed starting 2 weeks after whole-body irradiation. Compared to sham irradiation, radiation impaired novel object recognition in female and male C57BL/6J wild-type mice. There were no effects of irradiation on contextual fear conditioning or spatial memory retention in the water maze. It is possible that oxidative damage might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive changes. Therefore, hippocampal and cortical levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and lipid peroxidation, measures of oxidative damage were assessed. There were no effects of irradiation on these measures of oxidative damage. As (56)Fe irradiation can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which may contribute to the impairments in novel object recognition, the effects of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on cognition following sham irradiation and irradiation were also assessed. ALA did not prevent radiation-induced impairments in novel object recognition and impaired spatial memory retention of sham-irradiated and irradiated mice in the probe trial after the first day of hidden platform training in the water maze. Thus, the novel object recognition test is particularly sensitive to detect early cognitive effects of (56)Fe irradiation through a mechanism unlikely involving ROS or oxidative damage.",Included

[Russian] The factors of a various energetic nature the extreme levels of which both directly (via special receptors) and mediately influence and change the functions of nervous system are studied. Empirical data suggest conclusively that the general biological regularities of the effects of an ""intensity-time"" type is also valid on the organism level if the central nervous system is thought of as an irritable object. In all cases the initial cause of the disturbed cerebral activity is an external energetic irritative action. It is demonstrated that the character of human response to the extreme effects of some flight factors corresponds to general biological regularity of the reaction toward irritating stimulus. In this case the general mechanism of such reactions of the nervous system is an exhaustion of the energetic brain resources. There have been derived the equalities which define the quantitative relationships among the equivalent levels of extreme flight factor effects and the common unit of their measurement is introduced. On the basis of general biological regularities of the body response to irritating stimulus, the method for estimating and predicting useful consciousness time of the pilot in case of a combined effect of the flight factors under extreme conditions is suggested.

Minimum T(brain) (38.5+/-0.4 degrees C) and T(carotid) (37.8+/-0.2 degrees C) in winter were higher than the minimum T(brain) (37.7+/-0.5 degrees C) and T(carotid) (36.4+/-0.8 degrees C) in summer that we have reported previously. Compared with summer, winter body temperature patterns were characterized by an absence of selective brain cooling (SBC), a higher range of T(brain), a range of T(carotid) that was significantly narrower (1.8 degrees C) than in summer (3.1 degrees C), and changes in T(carotid) and T(brain) that were more highly correlated (r=0.99 in winter vs r=0.83 in summer). These findings suggest that in winter the effects of the carotid rete are reduced, which eliminates SBC and prevents independent regulation of T(brain), thus coupling T(brain) to T(carotid). The net effect is that T(carotid) varies little. A possible consequence is depression of metabolism, with the survival advantage of conservation of energy. These findings also suggest that the carotid rete has wider thermoregulatory effects than its traditional SBC function.",Excluded
1299,"Neuro-oncological diagnosis in patients without histological confirmation The impossibility to conduct a histological diagnosis could be due to different reasons: (1) patient's refusal to undergo surgery/biopsy. (2) Technical difficulties: despite the advance in surgical procedures, the removal of lesions that are located either in critical or in deep areas represents a considerable risk for patients. (3) Quality/quantity of the sample. In rare cases even when the surgical sample is achieved it could be impossible to reach a histological confirmation, for example due to the small amount of tissue obtained. The lack of histology leads to suboptimal therapy, incorrect prognosis, and misinterpretation of clinical trials and furthermore undermines the possibility to perform most radiation and chemotherapy protocols. In this setting the morphological data obtained with conventional MR imaging may be integrated with the metabolic, structural and perfusional information provided by new MR and metabolic techniques (spectroscopy, SPECT, PET in particular). © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
2283,"[Palliation of brain metastases: factors associated with survival] One hundred ten patients with brain metastases (76 lung cancer, 11 breast cancer, 7 colorectal cancer and others) were treated with radiotherapy, and the results were retrospectively evaluated. Neurologic symptoms were improved in 66% of patients. The relationship between improvement of neurologic symptoms and several factors, including irradiation dose, primary lesion, histology, term between first treatment and recurrence, clinical symptoms and CT findings, was analyzed. There was no significant correlation between symptom relief and these factors except for the number of metastatic lesions. Four of 110 patients could survive more than 2 years after radiotherapy: one with lung cancer, one with breast cancer, one with rectum cancer and one with uterine cancer. The factors that were analyzed for symptom relief were also studied to determine their effect on the survival of lung cancer patients with brain metastases. The patients who had higher dose irradiation (50 Gy) of improvement of neurological symptoms after radiotherapy survived significantly longer than those who had 30 Gy of irradiation or no symptom relief. Multivariate analysis of these factors showed that improvement of symptoms and irradiation dose were similarly important prognostic factors, whereas the others were not correlated with survival.",Excluded
1769,"Intraocular gene transfer of pigment epithelium-derived factor rescues photoreceptors from light-induced cell death In this study, we investigated whether intraocular gene transfer of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) ameliorates the extent of light-induced photoreceptor cell death. Lewis rats received intravitreous injection of 3 x 10(9) particles of adenoviral vector expressing PEDF (AdPEDF.11) in one eye and 3 x 10(9) particles of empty adenoviral vector (AdNull.11) in the contralateral eye. The rats were then dark-adapted for 3 days after which they were continuously exposed to fluorescent light (2,500 lux) for 0, 6, 24, 96, and 168 h. Both eyes were then enucleated and processed for morphometric analysis. Cell death in the retina was examined using TUNEL staining with a propidium iodide counterstain. The photoreceptor cell counts in each of the three groups were significantly different (P < 0.001). Eyes that received intravitreous injection of AdNull.11 or no injection showed a greater number of pyknotic photoreceptor cells and a reduced photoreceptor cell density as compared to eyes treated with intravitreous AdPEDF.11 injection. AdNull.11 treated eyes showed a lesser but still significant protection of photoreceptor cells when compared to untreated eyes. Fewer TUNEL-positive photoreceptor cells were present in AdPEDF.11 treated eyes than in AdNull.11 treated or untreated eyes (P = 0.004). The amplitudes of the ERG a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potentials (OPs) were increased significantly by treatment (P < 0.05). These data suggest that adenovirus vector-mediated intraocular expression of PEDF significantly increases photoreceptor cell survival following excessive light exposure. Neuroprotection may result from inhibition of light-induced apoptotic processes. This study provides proof of concept for a gene transfer approach to modulating retinal cell death resulting from photo-oxidative damage and supports the hypothesis that gene transfer of PEDF is broadly applicable to modulating apoptosis in the retina.",Excluded

She reported a similar episode 1 week prior after which her vision recovered, as well as a month-long history of left-sided temporal headaches associated with photosensitivity. Review of systems was positive for episodic paresthesias of bilateral forearms, hands, and feet. She denied constitutional symptoms, rash, joint pain, and drug use of any kind. Family history was remarkable for father with ocular migraine, and grandparents with rheumatoid arthritis and neurosarcoidosis. Exam revealed a left monocular lower quandrantanopsia, normal venous pulsations, no cherry red spot and a normal neurological exam. An extensive rheumatic and infectious workup was negative, including a hypercoaguability panel, antinuclear antibody, ESR, CRP, and hemoglobin evaluation. A brain MRI/MRA without contrast showed patent bilateral ophthalmic arteries. Face and neck MRI with contrast, transthoracic echocardiography with bubble study, electromyography, as well as nerve conduction studies were all unremarkable. Given the negative workup, the presumable etiology was thought to be vasospasm with migraine. She was started on low dose aspirin for secondary stroke prevention, and propranolol for migraine prophylaxis. IMPACT: This case highlights the clinical manifestations of retinal artery occlusion, as well as the possible etiologies of retinal artery occlusion. Workup should be tailored to an age appropriate differential. DISCUSSION: Overall, central and branch retinal artery occlusions (CRAO and BRAO) are rare with an incidence of approximately 1 to 10 in 100,000, with an affected mean age of 60-65 years. The etiology varies with age, with carotid artery atherosclerosis being most common overall, as high as 70%; however, for patients less than 40 years of age, cardiogenic embolism is much more likely. Therefore, workup for younger patients should be focused on evaluating for sources of cardiogenic embolism such as arrhythmias, murmurs, congenital heart disease, and substance abuse. For older patients, temporal arteritis should be ruled out. Vascular diseases such as fibromuscular dysplasia, radiation injury, or hematologic diseases including sickle cell anemia, hypercoagulable states, and hyperviscosity syndrome can affect all ages and should be investigated if other causes are excluded. Rare causes of CRAO/BRAO include infections due to Bartonella, toxoplasmosis, and varicella; ocular surgery; fat or amniotic fluid embolism; and vasospasm with or without migraine, which is a diagnosis of exclusion. There have only been case studies describing CRAO associated with vasculitis.",Excluded
1937,"Terrestrial isopods congregate under a low-level beta-emitter source Ionizing radiation is ubiquitous, but very few experiments have investigated the biological effects of the natural background radiation at very low doses (>10 mGy/yr). We examined whether the background radiation, or radiation of a slightly higher level, has a role in evoking changes in behaviors of terrestrial isopods (woodlice). Upon exposure to a source giving 15 times the background level placed at one end of a box, a significant increase in the number of woodlice gathering under the beta-source was observed with time, as compared with the sham control. Terrestrial isopods have chemoreceptors (the olfactory system) on the terminal segment of their antennae. An additional experiment confirmed the involvement of these antennae in the radiation effect on behavior. After the excision of the antennae, no beta-taxis response was observed. The behavior of the group exposed to the source giving 30 times the background tended to decrease gradually in the area of the source, and the individuals aggregated in the area away from the source. Thus, the olfactory sensor in the antennae may be an important organ involved in the prompt response to radiation exposure, and the discrimination of the radiation field strengths of radioisotopes.",Included
1815,"Genetic and firefly metaheuristic algorithms for an optimized neuro-fuzzy prediction modeling of wildfire probability In the terrestrial ecosystems, perennial challenges of increased frequency and intensity of wildfires are exacerbated by climate change and unplanned human activities. Development of robust management and suppression plans requires accurate estimates of future burn probabilities. This study describes the development and validation of two hybrid intelligence predictive models that rely on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA) and firefly algorithm (FA), for the spatially explicit prediction of wildfire probabilities. A suite of ten explanatory variables (altitude, slope, aspect, land use, rainfall, soil order, temperature, wind effect, and distance to roads and human settlements) was investigated and a spatial database constructed using 32 fire events from the Zagros ecoregion (Iran). The frequency ratio model was used to assign weights to each class of variables that depended on the strength of the spatial association between each class and the probability of wildfire occurrence. The weights were then used for training the ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-FA hybrid models. The models were validated using the ROC-AUC method that indicated that the ANFIS-GA model performed better (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.92; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.91) than the ANFIS-FA model (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.89; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.88). The efficiency of these models was compared to a single ANFIS model and statistical analyses of paired comparisons revealed that the two meta-optimized predictive models significantly improved wildfire prediction accuracy compared to the single ANFIS model (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.82; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.78). We concluded that such predictive models may become valuable toolkits to effectively guide fire management plans and on-the-ground decisions on firefighting strategies.

1568,"The effects of electrode material, charge density and stimulation duration on the safety of high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in rats High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of deep brain structures is a powerful therapeutic tool for the treatment of various movement disorders in patients. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of this therapeutic approach on basal ganglia network function are still largely unknown. Hitherto, experimental studies have focused on short-term stimulation. Since patients receive HFS for many years, animal studies which reproduce the conditions of long-term stimulation will be necessary to accurately investigate the effects of HFS. However, stimulation parameters of acute HFS cannot be easily transferred to long-term conditions. Accordingly, for this purpose we studied the influence of different charge densities (0, 3, 6.5, 13 and 26 microC/cm2/phase) and duration (4 h or 3 days) of subthalamic nucleus (STN)-HFS using stainless-steel and platinum-iridium (Pt/Ir) electrodes on neuronal tissue damage in rats. Our data demonstrate the advantage of Pt/Ir over stainless-steel electrodes when used in short-term HFS (frequency 130 Hz, pulse width 60 micros) and indicate that HFS using Pt/Ir-electrodes pulsed with 3 microC/cm2/phase over 3 days did not produce any relevant tissue damage in the STN.",Excluded
2114,"Ultra light-sensitive and fast neuronal activation with the Ca2+-permeable channelrhodopsin CatCh The light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) has rapidly become an important tool in neuroscience, and its use is being considered in therapeutic interventions. Although wild-type and known variant ChR2s are able to drive light-activated spike trains, their use in potential clinical applications is limited by either low light sensitivity or slow channel kinetics. We present a new variant, calcium translocating channelrhodopsin (CatCh), which mediates an accelerated response time and a voltage response that is ~70-fold more light sensitive than that of wild-type ChR2. CatCh's superior properties stem from its enhanced Ca2(+) permeability. An increase in [Ca2(+)](i) elevates the internal surface potential, facilitating activation of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and indirectly increasing light sensitivity. Repolarization following light-stimulation is markedly accelerated by Ca2(+)-dependent BK channel activation. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown principle: shifting permeability from monovalent to divalent cations to increase sensitivity without compromising fast kinetics of neuronal activation. This paves the way for clinical use of light-gated channels.",Excluded

Here we investigated the role of morning light exposure as a countermeasure for impaired cognitive performance and mood under sleep restriction (SR). Seventeen participants took part of a 48h laboratory protocol, during which three different light settings (separated by 2 wks) were administered each morning after two 6-h sleep restriction nights: a blue monochromatic LED (light-emitting diode) light condition (BL; 100 lux at 470 nm for 20 min) starting 2 h after scheduled wake-up time, a dawn-simulating light (DsL) starting 30 min before and ending 20 min after scheduled wake-up time (polychromatic light gradually increasing from 0 to 250 lux), and a dim light (DL) condition for 2 h beginning upon scheduled wake time (<8 lux). Cognitive tasks were performed every 2 h during scheduled wakefulness, and questionnaires were administered hourly to assess subjective sleepiness, mood, and well-being. Salivary melatonin and cortisol were collected throughout scheduled wakefulness in regular intervals, and the effects on melatonin were measured after only one light pulse. Following the first SR, analysis of the time course of cognitive performance during scheduled wakefulness indicated a decrease following DL, whereas it remained stable following BL and significantly improved after DsL. Cognitive performance levels during the second day after SR were not significantly affected by the different light conditions. However, after both SR nights, mood and well-being were significantly enhanced after exposure to morning DsL compared with DL and BL. Melatonin onset occurred earlier after morning BL exposure, than after morning DsL and DL, whereas salivary cortisol levels were higher at wake-up time after DsL compared with BL and DL. Our data indicate that exposure to an artificial morning dawn simulation light improves subjective well-being, mood, and cognitive performance, as compared with DL and BL, with minimal impact on circadian phase. Thus, DsL may provide an effective strategy for enhancing cognitive performance, well-being, and mood under mild sleep restriction.",Excluded

Lewy body synucleinopathies involve decreased cardiac sympathetic innervation and functional abnormalities in residual noradrenergic terminals. This observational, retrospective, cohort study describes long-term trends in indices of cardiac sympathetic innervation and function in synucleinopathies. Method(s): Patients with PD (N = 31), PAF (N = 9), or MSA (N = 9) underwent repeated <sup>18</sup>F-dopamine positron emission tomography (median follow-up 3.5 years). Interventricular septal <sup>18</sup>F-dopamine-derived radioactivity 8 min after tracer injection (8' Radioactivity) was used as an index of sympathetic innervation and the slope of mono-exponential decline of radioactivity between 8 and 25 min (k<inf>8'-25'</inf>) as an index of intraneuronal vesicular storage. Healthy volunteers (HVs) (N = 33) and individuals at high risk of PD (N = 15) were controls. Result(s): Upon initial evaluation the groups with PD and orthostatic hypotension (OH), PAF, or PD and no OH had low mean 8' Radioactivity compared to HVs (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0002, p = 0.006) and had elevated k<inf>8'-25'</inf> (p = 0.0007, p = 0.007, p = 0.06).

Trans-Mitrofanoff access limits the size of endoscopic stone fragmenting devices, risking prolonged procedures, incomplete stone clearance and damage to the continent conduit. Access through previous surgical access sites risks bowel injury. This case series reports outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous cystolitholapaxy (PCCL), using ultrasound-guided access and direct track closure, thereby limiting radiation exposure and avoiding suprapubic catheters (SPCs). Patients and Methods: Seven PCCL procedures were performed in five patients with closed urethras. Average age 32 years, primary diagnoses: spina bifida, vertebrae, anus, trachea, esophagus, renal (VATER) syndrome, bladder exstrophy and traumatic brain injury. Four used Mitrofanoff stomas and one an SPC. Average largest stone was 18.57 mm (range 10-30 mm). Five procedures were for multiple stones (range 2-30 stones). Result(s): Each PCCL achieved complete stone clearance. Average operative time: 146 min (range 72-250 min). No intraoperative blood loss or bladder perforation.

Brain metastasis after PCI is an unsolved issue in SCLC in terms of its dismal prognosis and the limitation of further treatment options. Regarding the treatment option, it is not determined whether re-whole brain radiotherapy (re-WBRT) is safe or gamma-knife surgery (GKS) has its role in SCLC. We investigated which treatment option could be recommended as the up-front therapy to improve survival for SCLC patients with brain metastasis who were previously treated with PCI. Method(s): The medical records were reviewed for SCLC patients who experienced brain metastases after receiving PCI from 2000 to 2010. We compared overall survival according to the modality of up-front therapy. Overall survival was determined as time from brain metastasis to death due to any cause. Result(s): In total, 245 patients had received PCI in a state of limited disease (n = 204) or extensive disease status (n = 41). Among them, 47 (19.2%) experienced brain metastases: 16.7% (34/204) in LD and 31.7% (13/41) in ED. At the time when brain metastasis developed, extracrainal disease was also on progressing state in 19 patients (40.4%). The modality of up-front therapy for brain metastasis was as follows: 17 (36.1%) got GKS, 14(29.8%) re-WBRT, 7 (14.9%) up-front chemotherapy without local therapy, and 9 (19.1%) did not receive any further treatment. The median overall survival after brain metastasis was 4.9 months. Among 31 patients who received GKS or re-WBRT, 10 patients received at least one subsequent chemotherapy in their lifetime after GKS (6/17, 35.3%) or re-WBRT (4/14, 28.6%). The median survival of GKS, re-WBRT and chemotherapy was 14.3, 3.9 and 6.0 months (P = 0.24), which showed the tendency favoring for up-front GKS. Although it failed to meet statistical significance.

If eFBB can be used for AD diagnosis, it can help to reduce radiation exposure and increase patient convinnience by discriminating between amyloid nagative AD and positive NC and replacing 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Method(s): We retrospectively collected 264 cases of eFBB, which included amyloid positive NC (25.42%) and negative AD (16.82%). In order to obtain SUVr for analysis, eFBB and dFBB images of each case were spatially registered though CT template and eFBB template, and count normalization was applied to cerebellum, brainstem, and whole brain regions, respectively to identify the best pre-processing step. We evaluated the explanatory power and classification performance of the data according to the intervention of eFBB through logistic regression analysis (LRA) and stratified 4-fold cross validation. For visual observation of the image, we observed the intensity distribution of the image through the t-contrast embedded in the SPM. Result(s): As a result of LRA, the highest explanatory power and classification performance (Nagelkerke R2=0.648, Accuracy=89.4%) were observed when using eFBB template and whole brain region as a reference region. Regardless, when both eFBB and dFBB were known to the model, the explanatory power and classification performance were improved. In evaluating the generalization performance of the selected model, it was also shown that classification performance improved when eFBB was involved in general.

2170,"[Molecular and cellular mechanisms of late radiation injuries] Late radiation damages arise more often in nonproliferating or slow proliferating tissues after local irradiation in large (intolerable) doses of ionizing radiation. Obviously the late radiation effects are induced by radiation damages to capillaries and disturbances of microcirculation in tissues. This is a basis for tissue hypoxia, ""oxidative stress"" and loss of parenchyma cells. The direct radiation effect on parenchyma cells has as a rule little importance for production of late radiation damages. Other type of late radiation damages can be discovered after sublethal irradiation of whole body. This is a cause of decrease of life span. In this case the important factors are also damages of vessels, disturbances in microcirculation and loss of parenchyma cells in ""target"" organs especially in neuroendocrine and immune systems. The new data on the possibility to decrease the late radiation damages after local or whole body irradiation using postradiation treatment with pulsed electric field (PEF) are considered.

Methods and Materials: In reviewing our experience with PCI as part of a complex protocol for advanced breast cancer, we present descriptive data on late central nervous system outcomes in those receiving PCI. After high-dose anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy, Stage IIIB/IV breast cancer responders underwent tandem autologous marrow transplantation. Those in continued remission were referred for PCI. Whole-brain radiotherapy was delivered by usual means, at 36 Gy in 20 fractions. Result(s): Twenty-four women, with median age 45 (28-61), were enrolled between 1995 and 1998. Disease was largely metastatic (79%), and 75% were previously exposed to chemotherapy or hormonotherapy. Ten patients received PCI, at a median of 13.4 (11.8-16.5) months from study entry. Six patients developed brain metastases, 2 despite PCI. Striking functional decline was documented in 3 patients (at 9 months, 4 years, and 5 years post-PCI), including one previously high-functioning woman requiring full care for posttreatment dementia.

Any further investigation of PCI in high-risk breast cancer will need to be approached with caution. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2011,"Serious adverse effects of gamma knife radiosurgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been proposed as an alternative to surgical resection. We report serious adverse effects of the treatment after follow-up periods over 9 years in 11 patients treated with GKRS between 1997 and 2000. The target volume of the entorhinoamygdalohippocampectomy area was 4.8-17.1 ml. Marginal dose of 20-25 Gy to the 50% isodose was delivered. One patient was drowned after suffering seizure 7 months after GKRS. Two patients did not show any reduction in seizure frequency over 9 and 18 months. Both patients requested open surgery and became seizure-free postoperatively. Four of the other eight patients were classified as Engel's class I within 4 years after GKRS. One of the four patients experienced symptomatic radiation-induced cerebral edema transiently, one developed radiation necrosis and required surgery 5 years after GKRS, and one developed cognitive impairment with hemiparesis 10 years after GKRS. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed a large cyst in the irradiated temporal lobe. This patient recovered fully after the cyst excision. Only one patient became seizure-free and antiepileptic drug-free without symptomatic radiation-induced complications. However, MR imaging revealed abnormal enhancement, cyst formation, and diffuse white matter change in the irradiated temporal lobe 9 years after GKRS. GKRS for MTLE causes adverse effects of delayed seizure remission and symptomatic radiation-induced complications. Therefore, GKRS cannot be considered as an ideal alternative to surgery for MTLE. Long-term follow-up studies including MR imaging with contrast medium are required for the patients even after successful control of seizures.",Excluded
1709,"Red LED photobiomodulation reduces pain hypersensitivity and improves sensorimotor function following mild T10 hemicontusion spinal cord injury BACKGROUND: The development of hypersensitivity following spinal cord injury can result in incurable persistent neuropathic pain. Our objective was to examine the effect of red light therapy on the development of hypersensitivity and sensorimotor function, as well as on microglia/macrophage subpopulations following spinal cord injury.METHODS: Wistar rats were treated (or sham treated) daily for 30 min with an LED red (670 nm) light source (35 mW/cm(2)), transcutaneously applied to the dorsal surface, following a mild T10 hemicontusion injury (or sham injury). The development of hypersensitivity was assessed and sensorimotor function established using locomotor recovery and electrophysiology of dorsal column pathways. Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL were performed to examine cellular changes in the spinal cord.RESULTS: We demonstrate that red light penetrates through the entire rat spinal cord and significantly reduces signs of hypersensitivity following a mild T10 hemicontusion spinal cord injury. This is accompanied with improved dorsal column pathway functional integrity and locomotor recovery. The functional improvements were preceded by a significant reduction of dying (TUNEL(+)) cells and activated microglia/macrophages (ED1(+)) in the spinal cord. The remaining activated microglia/macrophages were predominantly of the anti-inflammatory/wound-healing subpopulation (Arginase1(+)ED1(+)) which were expressed early, and up to sevenfold greater than that found in sham-treated animals.CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that a simple yet inexpensive treatment regime of red light reduces the development of hypersensitivity along with sensorimotor improvements following spinal cord injury and may therefore offer new hope for a currently treatment-resistant pain condition.",Excluded

1538,"The time course of the light-induced extracellular potassium change around receptors and at the vitreal surface compared with the time course of slow PIII wave in the isolated rabbit retina The experimental preparation was a piece of isolated rabbit retina, the lower side of which was superfused in a chamber with a plasma-saline mixture kept at 35 degrees C to which, in some experiments, either sodium aspartate and glutamate, or Mg2+, were added to suppress second order neuronal activity. The upper side was exposed to an atmosphere of humidified oxygen. With longlasting light stimuli (30-180 s) the [K+]0 around receptors first falls from its dark-adaptation value (4.6 +/- 0.4 mM) to 3.3 +/- 0.6 mM and then reaccumulates nearly to the pre-stimulus value. The time course of reaccumulation varies greatly (30-180 s) between preparations. The peak time (90% value) of the [K+]0 decrease is several seconds. It seems that the more rapidly the retina is prepared the shorter the peak time of the [K+]0 reaccumulation and the more rapid the [K+]0 reaccumulation. This suggests that the [K+]0 reaccumulation is effected by active, oxygen-dependent mechanisms. PIII always precedes the [K+]0 change, its peak time is several 100 ms. During longlasting light stimuli (30-180 s) slow PIII reflects the difference in the [K+]0 changes around the photoreceptors and at the vitreal surface. The rapidly and carefully isolated preparations exhibit a slow cornea-positive potential similar to a c-wave, when second order neuronal activity is not suppressed.",Excluded

In this study, we investigated the expression and origin of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the subacute brain injury after a single high-dose irradiation using 60 Sprague-Dawley rats. The right cerebral hemispheres of rats were exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays using Ir-192. The radiation effect was assessed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks after irradiation, and the results were compared with those in sham operation group. Histological changes characteristic of radiation injury were correlated with the duration after the single dose irradiation. The loss of cortical thickness also increased with the lapse of time after irradiation. The TNF-alpha expression in the irradiated cerebral hemispheres was significantly increased compared with that in the sham operation group. TGF-beta 1 expression was also increased in the irradiated hemispheres. Immunohistochemical study revealed that TGF-beta 1 was expressed predominantly by infiltrating macrophages and astrocytes around the necrotic areas. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 may play prominent roles in the radiation injuries after a single high-dose irradiation.",Included
1751,"Predicting ophthalmoscopic visibility of retinal photocoagulation lesions byhigh-speedOCT: An animal studyinrabbits Purpose: Optical tomography (OCT) was successfully used to investigate tissue changes after photocoagulation. It is able to grade the strength and spatial extension of the lesions with high accuracy. We developed a high-speed OCT (840 nm, 200,000 A-scans/s) and a slitlamp-based OCT (1060 nm, 90,000 A-scans/s), to visualizes effects of the laser irradiation during laser exposure. Based on ex-vivo results changes in tissue scattering and, by use of the Doppler signal, tissue motion caused by thermal expansion and coagulation-induced tissue contraction were measured in rabbits. Aim was to develop algorithms for quantitative detection of visible photocoagulation lesions in-vivo. Method(s): OCT image series (up to 1000 B-Scans/s) were recorded in Chinchilla Grey rabbits during laser exposure. Lesions were applied with different spot size and exposure times. Irradiance was varied from below threshold until strong lesions were visible in the fundus. Using cross-correlation of images, motion due to heart beat was corrected. More than 200 lesions having sufficient image quality with respect to noise and motion artifacts were evaluated. Tissue scattering and axial movement of the neuronal retina was automatically determined from the images sequence and 26 different parameters were calculated which were then correlated with the ophthalmoscopic visibility of the lesions. Sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were calculated. Result(s): During coagulation an increase of scattering was observed near the retinal pigment epithelium. It predicted the ophthalmoscopic visibility of lesions with 80% sensitivity and 78% specificity. Area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.78, Youden index 0.58. Axial tissue motion predicted lesions only with a Youden index of 0.45; sensitivity and specificity were 63% and 80%, respectively. The AUC was 0.74. Considerably better results were obtained when the local tissue expansion was calculated. This parameter is sensitive to local changes of the tissue morphology and corrects for global tissue motion. AUC reached 0.82 with 71% sensitivity, 91% specificity and a Youden index of 0.62. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, high-speed OCT recording during photocoagulation was able to predict the visibility of the lesion with good reliability. It does provide information on tissue effects of photocoagulation and may be used for an online dosimetry.",Excluded
1980,"Effect of low-power laser irradiation on impulse conduction in anesthetized rabbits Low-power laser analgesic effect was generally accepted in clinical cases, whereas there was no direct evidence to indicate that low-power laser irradiation suppressed an impulse conduction within a peripheral nerve. The effect of low-power laser irradiation on electrically evoked responses within the sural nerve was electrophysiologically analyzed in anesthetized rabbits. High threshold evoked responses (conduction velocity was about 11 m/sec, unmyelinated A delta), which were induced by an electrical stimulation to the peripheral stump of the nerve, were significantly suppressed (9 to 19% inhibition) during low-power laser irradiation, which applied to the exposed sural nerve between the stimulus site and the recording site. The suppressive effect was reversible and recovered to the control level after the irradiation. Experimental evidence indicated that low-power laser irradiation suppressed the impulse conduction of unmyelinated A delta afferents in peripheral sensory nerve, which caused a pain sensation. Our data suggest that low-power laser acts as a reversible direct suppressor of neuronal activity.",Excluded
1237,"Improvement of dose distribution with irregular surface compensator in whole brain radiotherapy The aim of this study was to evaluate the dosimetries of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) using irregular surface compensator (ISC) compare with conventional radiotherapy. The ISC involves modulation of the beam with the multileaf collimator (MLC), and increases the dose homogeneity to the target volume while decrease the absorbed dose in irradiated tissues outside the targeted tissue. Treatment plans were produced for 10 patients. All treatments were carried out with 10 MV photon energy from a Clinac iX with 120 MLC (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The prescription dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions at the isocenter. With Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems), the anisotropic analytical algorithm was used for the dose calculation. The tissue heterogeneity correction was used in all the treatment plans. For ISC, the skin flash tool application was used to extend the optimal fluence. These two treatment plans were compared in terms of does in the planning target volume (PTV), the dose homogeneity index (DHI), the maximum doses, eye and lens doses and the monitor unit (MU) counts required for treatment. Average values were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Compared with the conventional WBRT, the ISC significantly reduced the DHI, the maximum dose, the volumes received at 105% of the prescription dose, as well as reducing both eye and lens doses (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). By contrast, the monitor unit counts were increased for ISC technique compared to the conventional WBRT (819 vs. 327, p < 0.01). The ISC technique for WBRT enables significantly better dose distribution in the PTV. As patients who receive WBRT have improved survival, the long-term side effects of radiotherapy become of increasing important. It is expected that with this technique, the risk of late radiotherapy- associated complication will be reduced. The ISC technique has been used in select patients with a long life expectancy at our institution.",Excluded
2031,"Comparison of tumour age response to radiation for cells derived from tissue culture or solid tumours Direct comparison of the cell age of 9L and KHT tumour cells derived either from tissue culture or solid tumours was achieved. Cells from dissociated KHT and 9L tumours (the latter implanted either subcutaneously or intracerebrally) and cells from tissue culture were separated into homogenous sized populations by centrifugal elutriation. In both tumour models these homogeneous sized populations correspond to populations enriched at different stages of the cell cycle. The survival of these elutriated cell populations was measured after a single dose of Cs-137 gamma rays. For cells isolated from 9L solid tumours, there was little variation in radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle; however, a very small but significant increase in resistance was found in late G<inf>1</inf> cells. This lack of a large variation in radiosensitivity through the cell cycle for 9L cells from solid tumours also was seen in 9L cells growing in monolayer tissue culture. When similar experiments were performed using the KHT sarcoma tumour model, the results showed that KHT cells in vitro exhibited a fairly conventional increase in radioresistance in both mid G<inf>1</inf> and late S. However, the cell age response of KHT cells from solid tumours was different; particularly in the late S and G<inf>2</inf> + M phases.

To investigate prostaglandin- induced radiation protection against alopecia, the hair of B6D2F<inf>1</inf> male mice was plucked from the right thigh and surrounding area to induce anagen. Fourteen days later, mice were injected subcutaneously in the neck with 10 mug 16,16 dm PGE<inf>2</inf> in 0.2 ml of vehicle, or with the vehicle alone.

On day 21 post-plucking, all animals were killed and a portion of the irradiated site was excised. The average hair counts per field in irradiated animals were 85 +/- 4 (6.5 Gy), 25 +/- 5 (8.5 Gy), and 5.5 +/- 0.7 (10 Gy). Animals receiving the prostaglandin systemically had values of 60 +/- 10 (6.5 Gy), 54 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 66 +/- 6 (10 Gy), and 30.1 +/- 8 (12.5 Gy). Topical application of the prostaglandin resulted in protection that yielded 52 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 34 +/- 4 (10 Gy), and 3.2 +/- 0.9 (12.5 Gy) hairs per field.

2238,"Co-delivery of pemetrexed and miR-21 antisense oligonucleotide by lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles and effects on glioblastoma cells Combination therapy using anticancer drugs and nucleic acid is a more promising strategy to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer and to enhance apoptosis. In this study, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs), which contain both pemetrexed and miR-21 antisense oligonucleotide (anti-miR-21), have been developed for treatment of glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain tumor. Prepared LPNs have been well characterized by particle size distribution and zeta potential measurements, determination of encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release experiments. Morphology of LPNs was determined by transmission electron microscopy. LPNs had a hydrodynamic size below 100 nm and exhibited sustained release of pemetrexed up to 10 h. Encapsulation of pemetrexed in LPNs increased cellular uptake from 6% to 78%. Results of confocal microscopy analysis have shown that co-delivery of anti-miR-21 significantly improved accumulation of LPNs in the nucleus of U87MG cells. Nevertheless, more effective cytotoxicity results could not be obtained due to low concentration of anti-miR-21, loaded in LPNs. We expect that the effective drug delivery systems can be obtained with higher concentration of anti-miR-21 for the treatment of glioblastoma.

Inclusion criteria for this study were (1) no ED according to a self-administered questionnaire before PB, (2) treatment with PB alone (125I; 144 Gy), (3) postimplant CT scan of the prostate 1 month after PB, and (4) minimum of 24 months of continuous follow-up. Fifty men met all inclusion criteria. ED was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire completed before and at each follow-up visit after LDRPB. Radiation doses to the NVB and PB were calculated on the basis of axial postimplant CT images. Multiple variables (patient-related and dosimetric quantifiers) that may predict for the development of ED were examined by univariate analysis.RESULTS: Thirty of the 50 men (60%) were potent at last follow-up. The only patient-related variable that predicted for the development of ED was patient age (<65 vs. >65 years; p=0.03). The calculated mean maximum doses to the NVB and PB were 684 Gy (range, 195-1277 Gy) and 498 Gy (range, 44-971 Gy), respectively.

There was no effect on tumor growth by visible light or by a single dose of 60Co irradiation at 4 Gy or 8 Gy, whereas 16 Gy inhibited tumor growth to 40% versus the control. Hematoporphyrin derivative alone slightly stimulated growth (P less than 0.1). Light in the presence of 10 mg hematoporphyrin derivative/kg inhibited tumor growth to 32%. 60Co irradiation in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a significant tumor growth inhibition (P less than 0.02). This growth inhibition was directly related to the concentration of hematoporphyrin derivative. The addition of 60Co to light in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a greater growth inhibition than light or 60Co irradiation alone. This effect was most pronounced when light was applied 30 minutes before 60Co irradiation. Our experiments in a subcutaneous rat glioma model suggest a radiosensitizing effect of hematoporphyrin derivative. Furthermore, the photodynamic inactivation is enhanced by the addition of 60Co irradiation.

Information was collected on IDDS function, treatment goals, treatment fields, prescribed doses, treatment energies, and cumulative radiation doses to the pump and the catheter.RESULTS: A total of 39 patients received 60 separate courses of radiation therapy, of which 12 patients received radiation with either the pump or the catheter in the field. The remaining patients received scatter radiation only. The goal of radiation was palliative in all but one of the patients. Cumulative pump doses ranged from 5 to 36 Gy, and catheter doses ranged from 15 to 45 Gy. Beam energies ranged from 6 to 18 MV photons. All devices were checked after the completion of radiotherapy with a median follow-up of 4.5 months, and all were found to be in good working condition.CONCLUSIONS: IDDS failures related to external beam radiation therapy seem to represent a rare occurrence.

Method of local adjustment of the parameters of mathematical models (examples of application)] To increase the accuracy of calculation of tolerance doses of the likelihood of radiation-induced complications in normal organs and tissues by using mathematical models, the author has developed a method for local mathematical model parameter adjustment (LMMPA) which included analysis of the structure of a mathematical model, systematization of clinical information and its goal-oriented use to determine the parameters of a model. The necessity of developing the LMMPA method stemmed from the complexity of the body exposed to radiation a system and from the quest for taking into account the impact of the system on the values of mathematical models. LMMPA may be regarded as the extension of determination of the parameters of mathematical models or as the interactive determination of their parameters that describing radiation exposures of complex biological systems. Different aspects of using of LMMPA are indicated how to apply it to the determination of tolerance doses for connective tissue, lung tissue, and the brain by using the Ellis and LQ models. The extended LMMPA is shown how to determine the parameters of a mathematical models for calculation of the likelihood of radiation-induced complications in the lung tissue.",Excluded
1279,"Carcinoma of the skin with perineural invasion Purpose. To evaluate the outcome and patterns of relapse in patients treated for skin carcinoma of the head and neck with either microscopic or clinical perineural invasion. Methods and Materials. Radiotherapy alone or combined with surgery was used to treat 135 patients with microscopic or clinical evidence of perineural invasion of skin carcinoma. All patients had at least 2 years of follow-up. Results. The 5-year local control rates without salvage therapy were 87% with microscopic perineural invasion and 55% with clinical perineural invasion. Overall, 88% of the local failures occurred in patients with positive margins. Almost half of the recurrences in patients with microscopic perineural invasion were limited to the first-echelon regional nodes. However, only 1 of 11 patients with basal cell carcinoma with microscopic perineural invasion had a nodal failure. Ninety percent of recurrences in patients with clinical perineural invasion occurred at the primary site. Cranial nerve deficits rarely improved after successful treatment of the primary disease. Radiographic abnormalities remained stable 30% of the time when patients had clinical evidence of progressive disease. Conclusions. Radiotherapy in patients with skin cancer with clinical perineural invasion should include treatment of the first-echelon regional lymphatics. The risk of regional node involvement is also relatively high for patients with squamous cell carcinoma with microscopic perineural invasion. In patients with clinical perineural invasion, the poor local control rates with conventional radiotherapy suggest a need for dose escalation with or without concomitant chemotherapy. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

1928,"Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance features of gynecologic abnormalities in women presenting with acute or chronic abdominal pain Advances in technology and improved availability have led to increased use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate women presenting to the emergency department or to their primary care provider with abdominal and/or pelvic pain. Computed tomographic examinations are often performed to evaluate the presence of appendicitis or renal stone disease. However, gynecologic abnormalities are frequently identified on these examinations. Although ultrasound remains the primary modality by which complaints specific to the pelvis are evaluated, in many instances, CT and MRI imaging occurs before sonographic evaluation.Historically, because of cost, radiation exposure, and relative ease of use, ultrasound examinations have preceded all other imaging modalities when evaluating pelvic disorders. However, as CT and MRI technology have improved, their use in diagnosing causes of pelvic pain has become equal to that of ultrasound. In some cases, primarily because of historic comfort with sonographic evaluation, gynecologic abnormalities originally diagnosed on CT or MRI may be immediately and unnecessarily reevaluated by ultrasound. For a woman in her reproductive years, the most common adnexal masses are physiological cysts, endometriomas, and cystic teratomas. Although lesions are often asymptomatic and incidentally detected, they can present with pain, and they increase the risk of ovarian torsion. Common causes of chronic pelvic pain in this population include leiomyomata and adenomyosis. In postmenopausal women, ovarian carcinoma, which often does not present clinically until a late stage, has to be included in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. If a gynecologic pathology is discovered on CT or MRI, an immediate follow-up ultrasound need not be pursued if the lesion can be characterized as benign, needing immediate surgical intervention, or a variant of normal anatomy. If, on the other hand, findings demonstrate a mass that either is uncharacteristic of a benign lesion, has an indeterminate risk for malignancy, or demonstrates suspicious characteristics for malignancy (such as enhancing mural nodules), further evaluation by serial ultrasound, biochemical marker, and/or CT or MRI is warranted. The purpose of this review is to present a series of commonly encountered gynecologic abnormalities with either CT or MR to make radiologists more familiar with gynecologic pathology on CT and MRI.

Recently, an in vitro study showed reduced clonogenic survival of mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) lung cancer cell lines in response to ionizing radiation compared with that of the wild type. To elucidate the role of EGFR mutations in radiation treatment, we evaluated the clinical response to WBRT and survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastases.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of 63 patients with brain metastases from lung adenocarcinoma who were treated with WBRT. Demographic data, EGFR mutation status, response to WBRT, and survival data were collected. Clinical response was assessed 1 month after the start of WBRT. Univariate and logistic regression models were used to test potential predictive factors associated with clinical response. Log-rank test and Cox regression were analyzed to identify factors that affected survival.RESULTS: Clinical response to WBRT was observed in 29 patients (46%), with 34 nonresponder patients (54%). Patients with EGFR mutations had higher response rates to WBRT compared with those with the wild-type (54% versus 24%; P = 0.045). Both the administration of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (P = 0.034) and EGFR mutation (P = 0.029) were independently associated with response to WBRT. In Cox regression analysis, WBRT responder (P = 0.010) and absence of extracranial metastases (P = 0.002) were associated with better survival.CONCLUSIONS: Both the EGFR mutations and the administration of EGFR TKI during WBRT were independent predictors of response to WBRT in brain metastases of lung adenocarcinoma.",Excluded
1251,"Circadian clock protein BMAL1 regulates melanogenesis through MITF The circadian clock is near ubiquitous, self-sustaining, and oscillates with a periodic cycle of about 24 hr. The skin circadian clock is known to be involved in various important cellular pathways including cell cycle, nucleotide excision repair, and metabolism by regulating the expression of specific target genes known as the clock-controlled genes (CCGs). In this study, we show that Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), an essential rate-limiting protein in melanin biosynthesis, is a transcriptional target of the circadian clock. Using primary human melanocytes, human melanoma cells and mouse skin tissues, we have established transcriptional regulation of MITF by the circadian clock, which translates into rhythmic 24 hr expression of MITF mRNA and protein levels. We also show that the circadian clock protein Brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (BMAL1) is a positive regulator of MITF, which causes an increase in melanin levels. Further, we demonstrate that upon exposure to solar UV-B radiation in presence of BMAL1, there is reduced gammaH2AX and cleaved PARP level compared to BMAL1 deficient group, which contributes to enhanced cell viability and survival. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the novel regulation of MITF by BMAL1 provides better protection against solar UV-B mediated genomic instability and melanomagenesis.",Excluded

1301,"Alopecia after prophylactic cranial irradiation. [Polish] Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is currently widely used in the treatment of patients with lung cancer, but despite that the data on alopecia after this type of treatment are limited. Aim. The aim of the study was to identify factors influencing the duration of alopecia after prophylactic cranial irradiation. Material and methods. Two groups of patients were analyzed: group I - 34 patients radically treated fornon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and group II - 18 patients undergoing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In group I 12 patients were treated with radiotherapy only, the remaining patients were treated with neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin + vinorelbin: PN or cisplatin + gemcitabin: PG) in 2 to 6 cycles. PCI was administered during the last tree weeks of thoracic irradiation or >=2 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy and consisted of 15 fractions of 2 Gy per day (30 Gy), 5 days per week. Patients from group II received 25 Gy in 10 fractions starting from the second week of thoracic irradiation; chemotherapy (cisplatin + vepesid: PE every 21 days) started concurrently with thoracic irradiation. Results. Alopecia occurred in all patients treated with PCI; hair loss began 2-3 weeks after the initiation of therapy. In group I full re-growth of hair occurred in 33 patients, one patient died during treatment, before hair re-growth had the chance to take place. Time to re-growth (TRG) was 1.5-6 months, median 2.5 months. In this group we observed a trend towards longer re-growths in patients who had received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.07). In group II hair re-growths occurred between 5 and 12 months after the completion of treatment, with median time of 10 months, and was significantly longer than in group I. Conclusion. The results suggest that the most important factor for TRG is the type and the number of chemotherapy cycles.",Excluded
2134,"Phase I study of weekly nedaplatin and concurrent pelvic radiotherapy as adjuvant therapy after radical surgery for cervical cancer Nedaplatin is an analog of cisplatin that was developed in Japan, and it exhibits less nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity than cisplatin. This study aimed to determine the recommended dose of weekly nedaplatin chemoradiotherapy in high-risk patients following radical surgery. Fifteen patients who required postoperative pelvic radiotherapy after radical surgery for cervical cancer were enrolled in the present study. Nedaplatin was designed to be administered for eight cycles (minimum five cycles) beginning at a weekly dose of 22.5 mg/m(2) and then escalating to 25, 27.5, and then to 30 mg/m(2). Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy and/or planned chemotherapy (prior to the completion of five cycles) due to toxicity. Nedaplatin administration was interrupted prior to the completion of five cycles in one of six patients at a dose of 27.5 mg/m(2). A more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy did not occur in any patient. Nedaplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) was safely administered, and two of three patients could receive the planned chemotherapy consisting of eight cycles of weekly nedaplatin. Our recommended weekly nedaplatin dose was determined to be 30 mg/m(2) administered for more than five cycles and up to eight cycles if possible. Weekly administration of nedaplatin may be more tolerable and less toxic than weekly administration of cisplatin.",Excluded
1469,"Ocular and cerebral hemo-fluid dynamics in microgravity: A mathematical model Purpose: Long-term exposure to microgravity is known to lead to visual impairment in many astronauts (VIIP syndrome). Upper body fluid shift, alterations in intraocular pressure (IOP), intracranial pressure (ICP), tissue biomechanics and blood flow are among the many factors hypothesized to contribute to VIIP. Due to the difficulty to single out each of these factors using in-vivo studies, we present a mathematical model to theoretically evaluate the interactions between fluid flows and pressures in the brain (blood, cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid) and eyes (blood and aqueous humor) and their possible mechanical implications in VIIP. Method(s): We propose a 0-dimensional (0d) mathematical model of fluid circulation in the eyes and brain, embedded into a 0d whole-body circulation model. The model includes retinal, choroidal and ciliary circulations in the eyes. As suggested in the literature, the effect of microgravity is accounted for by i) considering zero hydrostatic pressure, ii) imposing zero central venous pressure, iii) decreasing the blood/aqueous humor oncotic pressure difference (iv) increasing the blood-brain barrier permeability. The model simulates microgravity-induced fluid redistribution in the upper body vasculature and variations in IOP and ICP, which are critical factors for VIIP. Result(s): The model predicts that, in microgravity conditions, ICP and IOP increase (Fig1a) and ocular blood flow decreases markedly in the choroid and ciliary circulations (Fig1b). Blood flow in the retina is found to experience smaller variations, owing to a purely mechanical perfusion control mechanism mainly enacted by the intraocular venous segments. Conclusion(s): The model suggests that i) the venous segments play a fundamental role in controlling pressures and fluxes in the ocular circulation, owing to the possibility of their collapse, and ii) the retinal circulation is less susceptible to microgravity-induced alterations than choroid and ciliary. These findings point towards further clinical assessment of ocular venous function in microgravity as a potential determinant factor for VIIP.",Excluded

1954,"Temporal evolution of perfusion parameters in brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery: comparison of intravoxel incoherent motion and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that is seeing increasing use in neuro-oncology and offers an alternative to contrast-enhanced perfusion techniques for evaluation of tumor blood volume after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). To date, IVIM has not been validated against contrast enhanced techniques for brain metastases after SRS. In the present study, we measure blood volume for 20 brain metastases (15 patients) at baseline, 1 week and 1 month after SRS using IVIM and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI. Correlation between blood volume measurements made with IVIM and DCE-MRI show poor correlation at baseline, 1 week, and 1 month post SRS (r = 0.33, 0.14 and 0.30 respectively). At 1 week after treatment, no significant change in tumor blood volume was found using IVIM or DCE-MRI (p = 0.81 and 0.41 respectively). At 1 month, DCE-MRI showed a significant decrease in blood volume (p = 0.0002). IVIM, on the other hand, demonstrated the opposite effect and showed a significant increase in blood volume at 1 month (p = 0.03). The results of this study indicate that blood volume measured with IVIM and DCE-MRI are not equivalent. While this may relate to differences in the type of perfusion information each technique is providing, it could also reflect a limitation of tumor blood volume measurements made with IVIM after SRS. IVIM measurements of tumor blood volume in the month after SRS should therefore be interpreted with caution.",Excluded

The celiac plexus is a network of nociceptive nerves, located along the aorta. Contemporary approaches (opioids, celiac plexus chemical neurolysis, systemic chemotherapy) are often inadequate. The celiac plexus has not previously been targeted using radiation. We hypothesized that ablative radiation targeted to the celiac plexus would alleviate pain. Method(s): We conducted a single arm prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients had celiac-pain > 4/10 on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), ECOG <= 3, no previous abdominal RT, and were evaluable if they completed treatment per protocol with at least one post-treatment visit. The celiac plexus was irradiated from D12 to L2. Radiation was given as either five fractions of 9 Gy or a single-fraction 25 Gy. The primary endpoint was NRS pain 3 weeks post-treatment. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, pain at 6w, analgesic use, and pain interference with daily activities as evaluated by 'Brief Pain Inventory' before and after radiation. Result(s): 21 patients were evaluable: 2 received fractionated treatment, 19 received 25Gy single fraction. The median age of the study population was 63 yr with a median ECOG of 1, 86% had pancreatic cancer. Patients were a median of 8 months out from diagnosis, and had received a median of one systemic treatment. Toxicity was limited to grade 1-2. All patients reported decreased celiac pain: median baseline pain was 6/10 (IQR 5-7.7), was reduced to 2.3/10 (IQR 0.9-3.9) (p < 0.0005) at 3w, and to 1.8/10 (IQR 0-3.2) (p < 0.0005) at 6w post-treatment. Seven patients reported their celiac pain had been eliminated entirely. Median morphine consumption decreased (NS). Improvement was seen in multiple quality of life measures, includ. total wellbeing (p = 0.0001), daily activity (p = 0.005) and sleep quality (p = 0.002).

Even rarer still are the subset of small cell lung cancers arising within the pulmonary artery. The prognostic significance of intravascular invasion into the pulmonary artery by lung cancer in the absence of metastatic is unclear but generally believed to be ominous. Method(s): We describe the case of a 64 year-old female diagnosed with Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome who was subsequently found to have left pulmonary artery tumour. Decision was made to move to VATS pneumonectomy due to the usually grim prognosis of related to nonoperative management of the more common pulmonary artery sarcomas, and anatomical limitations for safe biopsy of the pulmonary artery. Unexpectedly histopathology revealed limited stage small cell lung cancer. We present this case to highlight problems encountered in diagnosing pulmonary artery tumours, the VATS approach to intrapericardial pneumonectomy and ultimately, the surgical and histopathological findings for a very rare presentation.

1878,"Reversible brain swelling in experimental cerebral malaria Recently, reversible brain swelling has been identified in cerebral malaria patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is unknown, if similar pathology occurs in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). We thus examined immunized C57BL/6 mice after single vaccination with radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) and naive C57BL/6 mice upon infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA-expressing mCherry. All mice were assessed according to the Rapid Murine Coma and Behavioral Scale (RMCBS) score once naive mice showed ECM. We further analyzed brain pathology by using high resolution small animal MRI in order to assess brain swelling and blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), immunohistochemical staining for microglia, single plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) to locate parasites microscopically and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to study parasites on a nanoscopic level. In contrast to naive mice, that showed extensive BBBD and brain swelling, all immunized mice survived the challenge and showed either reversible brain swelling and mild BBBD or no pathological signal alteration on MRI. Furthermore, less microglial activation was found in immunized mice compared to naive mice. However, along the rostral migratory stream microglial activation appeared to be similar in both groups. Distinct brain areas with higher parasite density could be observed in both groups, although parasite distribution was more disseminated in naive mice. By employing CLEM, we demonstrated that parasites have a high propensity towards the endothelium. In summary, we showed for the first time that reversible brain swelling also occurs in a mouse model of ECM by using advanced imaging techniques. We further identified hot spots of parasite accumulation and inflammation. This model may present a valuable tool to understand the mechanisms of reversible brain swelling in ECM. .",Excluded
2443,"The source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the goldfish: a differential irradiation protocol We have used a partial irradiation paradigm to examine the provenance of cells that participate in Wallerian cellular responses in the goldfish visual system. Animals which received 50 Gy whole-body gamma-irradiation showed virtually complete inhibition of the proliferative burst usually seen after optic nerve section. These animals did, however, show a robust hyperplastic response in the optic tract that we believe represents the migration of nearby microglial cells into the affected tract. When only the postcephalic body was irradiated, proliferating cells in the major hematopoietic organs of the fish, the kidney and pronephros, were substantially inhibited. Despite this, the Wallerian cellular response in the visual paths was essentially normal. Thus, there is no obligate requirement for peripheral proliferative cells to participate in central Wallerian degeneration in the fish. However, when only the head was irradiated, and the hematopoietic organs were spared, there was a proliferative response in the visual system. We believe this represents the invasion of the visual pathways by peripheral blood cells through the optic nerve lesion and blood vessels in the nerve itself. This invasion, however, is not sufficient to generate substantial hyperplasia. In summary, although we find evidence for a small contribution by exogenous cells, the major source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the fish is the endogenous microglia. Our data underscore the importance of elucidating the mechanisms by which microglial cells are activated and the role that they play in regeneration.",Included
1725,"Oxidative stress and adult neurogenesis-Effects of radiation and superoxide dismutase deficiency Hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory and in spatial navigation. Production of new neurons that are functionally integrated into the hippocampal neuronal network is important for the maintenance of functional plasticity. In adults, production of new neurons in the hippocampus takes place in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of dentate gyrus. Neural progenitor/stem cells go through processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and maturation. This process is exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress, and perturbation in the redox balance in the neurogenic microenvironment can lead to reduced neurogenesis. Cranial irradiation is an effective treatment for primary and secondary brain tumors. However, even low doses of irradiation can lead to persistent elevation of oxidative stress and sustained suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are major antioxidant enzymes for the removal of superoxide radicals in different subcellular compartments. To identify the subcellular location where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated after cranial irradiation, different SOD deficient mice have been used to determine the effects of irradiation on hippocampal neurogenesis. The study results suggest that, regardless of the subcellular location, SOD deficiency leads to a significant reduction in the production of new neurons in the SGZ of hippocampal dentate gyrus. In exchange, the generation of new glial cells was significantly increased. The SOD deficient condition, however, altered the tissue response to irradiation, and SOD deficient mice were able to maintain a similar level of neurogenesis after irradiation while wild type mice showed a significant reduction in the production of new neurons. © 2012.",Included
2020,"Systemic HDAC3 inhibition ameliorates impairments in synaptic plasticity caused by simulated galactic cosmic radiation exposure in male mice Deep space travel presents a number of measurable risks including exposure to a spectrum of radiations of varying qualities, termed galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) that are capable of penetrating the spacecraft, traversing through the body and impacting brain function. Using rodents, studies have reported that exposure to simulated GCR leads to cognitive impairments associated with changes in hippocampus function that can persist as long as one-year post exposure with no sign of recovery. Whether memory can be updated to incorporate new information in mice exposed to GCR is unknown. Further, mechanisms underlying long lasting impairments in cognitive function as a result of GCR exposure have yet to be defined. Here, we examined whether whole body exposure to simulated GCR using 6 ions and doses of 5 or 30 cGy interfered with the ability to update an existing memory or impact hippocampal synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism believed to underlie memory processes, by examining long term potentiation (LTP) in acute hippocampal slices from middle aged male mice 3.5-5 months after radiation exposure. Using a modified version of the hippocampus-dependent object location memory task developed by our lab termed ""Objects in Updated Locations"" (OUL) task we find that GCR exposure impaired hippocampus-dependent memory updating and hippocampal LTP 3.5-5 months after exposure. Further, we find that impairments in LTP are reversed through one-time systemic subcutaneous injection of the histone deacetylase 3 inhibitor RGFP 966 (10 mg/kg), suggesting that long lasting impairments in cognitive function may be mediated at least in part, through epigenetic mechanisms.",Included

Current exercise regimens are time-consuming and insufficiently effective; an integrated countermeasure is needed that addresses musculoskeletal along with cardiovascular health. High-intensity, short-duration rowing ergometry and supplemental resistive strength exercise may achieve these goals. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers completed 5 wk of head-down-tilt bed rest (HDBR): 18 were randomized to exercise, 9 remained sedentary. Exercise consisted of rowing ergometry 6 days/wk, including interval training, and supplemental strength training 2 days/wk. Measurements before and after HDBR and following reambulation included assessment of strength, skeletal muscle volume (MRI), and muscle metabolism (magnetic resonance spectroscopy); quadriceps muscle biopsies were obtained to assess muscle fiber types, capillarization, and oxidative capacity. Sedentary bed rest (BR) led to decreased muscle volume (quadriceps: -9 +/- 4%, P < 0.001; plantar flexors: -19 +/- 6%, P < 0.001). Exercise (ExBR) reduced atrophy in the quadriceps (-5 +/- 4%, interaction P = 0.018) and calf muscle, although to a lesser degree (-14 +/- 6%, interaction P = 0.076).

1832,"Control of rat hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons by a circadian clock that is entrained by the daily light-off signal Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that the immediate-early gene, c-fos can regulate, through its protein product Fos, the expression of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene. In the present study, immunohistochemistry for Fos and beta-endorphin was used to assess the basal activity of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin-producing neurons throughout a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Here, we showed that Fos is undetectable in most beta-endorphin neurons from late morning until 30 min after light offset in the evening, whereas Fos is spontaneously expressed in these neurons after 1 h following dark onset. The number of beta-endorphin neurons expressing Fos increases continuously during the first half of the dark phase, is maximal at the middle of this phase and decreases through late night and early morning, reaching a nadir 2-3 h after light onset. Acute shifts of lighting parameters allowed us to demonstrate that the light-off signal per se is neither sufficient nor necessary for Fos expression in beta-endorphin neurons. However, when recurrent, this signal is able to entrain Fos expression after a period of adaptation to the new light/dark schedule. Moreover, an expression of Fos in beta-endorphin neurons persists during subjective night in rat exposed to constant light or constant dark for two to three days. Thus, the occurrence of the daily rhythmic increase in the expression of Fos protein in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons exclusively at (subjective) night suggests that these neurons are, most likely, controlled by a (circadian) nocturnal oscillator. Our data also reveal an interesting property of this oscillator: its entrainment by the daily light-to-dark transition signal.",Excluded
1496,"SPECT image segmentation for estimation of tumour volume and activity concentration in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE radionuclide therapy Background: Dosimetry in radionuclide therapy has the potential to allow for a treatment tailored to the individual patient. One therapeutic radiopharmaceutical where patient-specific dosimetry is feasible is <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE, used for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours. The emission of gamma photons by <sup>177</sup>Lu allows for imaging with SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). One important step for dosimetry using this imaging technique is the SPECT image segmentation, which needs to be robust and accurate for the estimated quantities to be reliable. This work investigates different methods for automatic tumour delineation in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE SPECT images. Three segmentation methods are considered: a fixed 42% threshold (FT), the Otsu method (OM) and a method based on Fourier surfaces (FS). Effects of including resolution compensation in the iterative SPECT image reconstruction are also studied. Evaluation is performed based on Monte Carlo-simulated SPECT images from 24 h and 336 h post injection (p.i.), for determination of the volume, activity concentration and dice similarity coefficient. In addition, patient data are used to investigate the correspondence of tumour volumes when delineated in SPECT or morphological CT or MR images. Patient data are also used to examine the sensitivity to the operator-dependent initialization. Result(s): For simulated images from 24 h p.i. reconstructed without resolution compensation, a volume and activity-concentration root-mean-square error below 15% is typically obtained for tumours above approximately 10 cm<sup>3</sup> when using OM or FS, while FT performs considerably worse. When including resolution compensation, the tumour volume becomes underestimated and the activity concentration overestimated. The FS method appears to be robust to noise, as seen for the 336 h images. The differences between the tumour volumes estimated from the SPECT images and the volumes estimated from morphological images are generally larger than the discrepancies seen for the simulated data sets. Conclusion(s): Segmentation results are encouraging for future dosimetry of tumours with volumes above approximately 10 cm<sup>3</sup>.

1402,"Weiss Lecture. Effects of radiations of different qualities on cells: molecular mechanisms of damage and repair Studies of ionizing radiations of different quality are discussed with particular emphasis on damage to DNA of mammalian cells. Three related themes are followed. Firstly, inactivation and mutation experiments with ultrasoft X-rays and slow heavy ions, coupled with theoretical analyses of the structures of the radiation tracks, have emphasized the biological importance of localized track features over nanometre dimensions. This led to the suggestion that the critical physical features of the tracks are the stochastic clusterings of ionizations, directly in or very near to DNA, resulting in clustered initial molecular damage including various combinations of breaks, base damages, cross-links, etc. in the DNA. The quantitative hypotheses imply that final cellular effects from high-LET radiations are dominated by their more severe, and therefore less repairable, clustered damage, and that these are qualitatively different from the dominant low-LET damage. Second, relative effectiveness of different types of radiation led to questions on the mechanisms of induction of chromosome exchanges. The high efficiency of ultrasoft X-rays, despite their very short track lengths, suggested that single sites of DNA damage may lead to exchanges by a molecular process involving interaction with undamaged DNA. Also it is shown that a single site-specific DNA break, introduced by restriction enzymes, sometimes leads to a large deletion when misrepaired by cell extracts. These deletions occur between short DNA repeats, and are therefore a form of 'illegitimate' recombination, but clearly do not involve the interaction of two damage sites. Third, it was shown that cells from patients with the radiosensitive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) lack a post-irradiation recovery process. The sensitivity of AT cells to high LET radiations was found to be reduced relative to that for normal cells, reinforcing the concept that high LET damage is less easy to repair. AT patients are prone to lymphoreticular cancers, and their cells show characteristic chromosomal rearrangements, which may be associated with misrepair at specific genomic sequences. Similarly, studies of radiation-induced leukaemia in the mouse have implicated rearrangement at specific interstitial chromosome sites, which are rich in telomere-like repeat sequences.

In parallel, we also examined the un-targeted contralateral striatum over the control for potential changes in proteins patterns that may have occurred due to the effects of irradiation to the unilateral striatum. A total of 17 reproducible and differentially expressed silver nitrate-stained protein spots in the irradiated striatum was detected on 2-D gel. Their subsequent analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-LC-MS/MS) resulted in the identification of 13 nonredundant proteins. Interestingly, out of these 13 changed proteins, 2 proteins were also detected in the contralateral striatum. Some of the significantly changed proteins identified were creatine kinase, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (PDA3), and peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2). Western analysis with anti-PDA3 and anti-Prx2 antibodies revealed 4 and 2 cross-reacting protein spots on 2-D gel blots. Interestingly, after GKS, in the irradiated and un-irradiated striata, these spots showed a shift toward the acidic side, suggesting post-translational modifications. Taken together, these results indicate that unilateral irradiation during GKS triggers molecular changes in the bilateral striata.",Included

1845,"Validation of a death assay for Angiostrongylus cantonensis larvae (L3) using propidium iodide in a rat model (Rattus norvegicus) Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a pathogenic nematode and the cause of neuroangiostrongyliasis, an eosinophilic meningitis more commonly known as rat lungworm disease. Transmission is thought to be primarily due to ingestion of infective third stage larvae (L3) in gastropods, on produce, or in contaminated water. The gold standard to determine the effects of physical and chemical treatments on the infectivity of A. cantonensis L3 larvae is to infect rodents with treated L3 larvae and monitor for infection, but animal studies are laborious and expensive and also raise ethical concerns. This study demonstrates propidium iodide (PI) to be a reliable marker of parasite death and loss of infective potential without adversely affecting the development and future reproduction of live A. cantonensis larvae. PI staining allows evaluation of the efficacy of test substances in vitro, an improvement upon the use of lack of motility as an indicator of death. Some potential applications of this assay include determining the effectiveness of various anthelmintics, vegetable washes, electromagnetic radiation and other treatments intended to kill larvae in the prevention and treatment of neuroangiostrongyliasis.

1897,"More than skin deep Introduction: A 47-year-old female without significant past medical history presented to her PCP with complaints of generalized pruritus for 3 weeks. She had previously been evaluated at an urgent care facility where she was given a course of steroids for her symptoms. Although she had brief improvement with prednisone, her symptoms returned after the course ended. She denied any other systemic symptoms specifically weight loss, fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, or change in bowel habits. She had recently noticed darkening of her urine and possible jaundice, but stated this seemed to be improving. Her physical exam was notable for jaundice without evidence of chronic liver disease. Her abdomen was soft , non-tender, and she had no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation showed AST 166 IU/L, ALT 90 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.4 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase of 401 IU/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse dilation of intrahepatic ducts and a 1.5-cm common bile duct (CBD), as well as 4.8 x 6.7 cm heterogeneous mass in the gallbladder with a second similarly enhancing lesion seen at the distal CBD. The pancreas appeared normal. An ERCP was performed which revealed a polypoid appearing mass within the distal bile duct. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed and this was biopsied after eversion into the duodenal lumen. Initial differential included biliary cystadenoma/ adenocarcinoma versus atypical cholangiocarcinoma versus lymphoma or IPMN of the bile ducts. However, biopsy specimen showed pigmented deposition on H&E stain with subsequent positive staining for S-100 and HMB proteins consistent with melanoma. Unfortunately, a staging MRI of the brain showed evidence of metastatic lesions. Thorough skin, eye, and mucosal examination did not reveal evidence of a primary lesion, and a CT-PET scan showed large, hypermetabolic lesions in the gallbladder and distal bile duct without evidence of other primary source. Therefore, our final diagnosis is primary biliary melanoma with metastatic disease to the brain. Only 10 other cases of primary biliary melanoma have been reported in the literature to date. Mortality is based on stage of disease at presentation with surgical resection providing the best chance for survival. Unfortunately, our patient had metastases present at diagnosis and was not a candidate for surgery. In the 6 months since diagnosis, she has been treated with radiation and Anti-CTLA 4 therapy and is undergoing evaluation for inclusion in clinical trials.",Excluded
2454,"Acute brain radiation injury of rabbits: A control study on proton MRS findings and histopathological changes. [Chinese] Objective: To establish radiation induced brain injury rabbit models for observing <sup>1</sup>H-MRS changes and probing on the correlation between MRS findings and histopathological changes. Method(s): Twenty-seven adult New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 9 groups (each n=3). The rabbit brains were irradiated with a single dose of 25 Gy. The observation posts included pre-radiation and 1 to 8 weeks after radiation. Each group underwent single-voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS, after the completion of image acquisition, the animals were sacrificed, and histological specimens were obtained. Pathological changes were analyzed combined with MRS changes. Result(s): The metabolic ratios of choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) increased first and then decreased obviously. Cho/Cr was 1.52 +/- 0.28 pre-radiation, 3.20 +/- 0.72 at 4 weeks, and 2.04 +/- 0.05 at 8 weeks after radiation. The metabolic ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/Cr showed significant decrease tendency, which decreased to 1.28 +/- 0.05 8 weeks after radiation from pre-radiation value of 1.97 +/- 0.25. The metabolic ratios of Cho/NAA showed significant increase after irradiation, which increased to 2.04 +/- 0.78 at 8 weeks after radiation, while the value was 1.19 +/- 0.15 pre-irradiation. After irradiation, vascular changes included telangiectasias and thrombosis, which appeared 2 weeks after irradiation in the histology samples. From 4 weeks after irradiation, ueuron swelling, cytoplasm edema, astrocytosis and microglia hyperplasia could be observed, and demyelination were observed in the white matter and corpus callosum. Conclusion(s): The changes of MRS index are closely related with histopathological findings of acute brain radiation injury of rabbits. MRS can be used as an imaging method for early diagnosis of radiation brain injury. Copyright © 2012 by the Press of Chinese Journal of Medical Imaging Technology.",Included
1889,"The future of radiation therapy in comprehensive cancer care Cancer is a very challenging condition and one of the fastest growing health challenges in the developed world. As cancer is not one but hundredsof conditions it cannot be expected to be managed by one approach. The cellular, metabolic and genetic factors as well as location, stage and extent all contribute to the characterisation of the disease as well as the therapeutic approach. Radiation should be viewed as a very powerful therapeutic agent in the arsenal to combat cancer. New technological advances have given us tools to apply radiation in a variety of ways dependent on clinical situation. Increasing precision of the radiation therapy systems is creating a trend towards higher doses delivered over shorter time periods. The use of stereotactic techniques is becoming more common. This increased precision, facilitated by image guidance integrated with systems, is decreasing exposure to the healthy tissue and hence with reduced complications. From being viewed as palliative care, radiation therapy has transformed to being applied with a curative intention in many clinical situations. A case example is Leksell Gamma Knife that delivers high doses with pin-point accuracy to tumours in the brain. In Gamma Knife surgery the therapeutic dose is delivered in one session and image guidance relies on advanced MRI technologies. In brain metastase patients the treatment has the potential to significantly transform the outcome and management options for large patient groups, having breast and lung cancer as primary cancer disease. Technologies applied in modern cancer care are continuously evolving and we have seen how radiation protocols are being combined with other methods in integrated management approaches. By combining radiation with other modalities such as surgery as well as biological agents and drugs further improvement can be achieved. Future more comprehensive care processes require collaboration between specialties and information and communication become important features to be able to utilize the most cost effective treatment. In this paper the global utilization of RT is further discussed with an overview of some national and global examples how the care practice of RT has been evolving. Trends and recent advancement will be discussed as well as cost-effectiveness aspects of radiation therapy. The need for strengthening partnership between industry and healthcare providers will be discussed as both are critical partners in the fight against cancer. Technological advancements and methods would not become available to health systems around the world without an Industry that develops solutions, secure that products meets regulatory demands and are properly tested prior to introduction.",Excluded
1961,"Clinical outcomes and prognostic factors in HER-2 positive breast cancer with brain metastasis: a single-centre experience Objective: To determine the characteristics and prognosis of brain metastasised HER-2 positive breast cancer (BC) patients. Study Design: Descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Turkey between 2000 and 2019. Methodology: HER-2 positive BC patients were analysed retrospectively and 105 patients were included in the study. Age 18 years and over, HER-2 positive BC, with BM (brain metastases) were the inclusion criteria. Patients with secondary malignancies, those with missing data, and irregular follow-up were excluded from the study. The age, type of treatment, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score, BM date, and the last contact date of the patients were obtained from the hospital records. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the time to BM and OS. Independent factors affecting OS and time to BM were determined using the Cox regression model. Result(s): Patients with ECOG PS score of 0-1 at the time of the BM had 19 months median overall survival (OS), while patients with ECOG PS score of 2 had 8 months (p <0.01). Median OS after BM was 32 and 14 months for patients with one BM and patients with multiple BM, respectively (p <0.01). Multivariate cox regression analyses revealed that time to progression of BM was shorter in patients with high-grade tumors compared to patients with low-grade tumors (p= 0.048), and in patients with de-novo metastasis compared to patients without de-novo metastasis (p= 0.003). Conclusion: Tumor grade and de-novo metastasis (extracranial metastasis at the time of diagnosis) are independent predictive factors that may cause the earlier occurrence of BM and affect mortality in BC patients.

2100,"5-Aminolevulinic acid strongly enhances delayed intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by ionizing irradiation: quantitative analyses and visualization of intracellular ROS production in glioma cells in vitro Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy has important roles in multimodal treatment for highly aggressive malignant gliomas. Previously, we demonstrated that multi-dose ionizing irradiation with repetitive administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) enhanced the host antitumor response and strongly inhibited tumor growth in experimental glioma. However, the mechanism of the radiosensitizing effect of 5-ALA is not known. Ionizing irradiation not only causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation initially by water radiolysis but also induces delayed production of mitochondrial ROS for mediating the long-lasting effects of ionizing irradiation on tumor cells. 5-ALA leads to high accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the mitochondria of tumor cells, yet can also improve dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in tumor cells. Here, we assessed the effect of 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis and delayed production of intracellular ROS after ionizing irradiation with 5-ALA in glioma cells in vitro. Temporal changes in intracellular 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis after ionizing irradiation in glioma cell lines were evaluated using flow cytometry (FCM). Then, the effect of 5-ALA on delayed production of intracellular ROS 12 h after ionizing irradiation in glioma cells was evaluated by FCM and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Ionizing irradiation had no effect on 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis in glioma cells. Delayed intracellular production of ROS was significantly higher than that just after ionizing irradiation, but 5-ALA pretreatment strongly enhanced the delayed intracellular production of ROS, mainly in the cytoplasm of glioma cells. This 5-ALA-induced increase in the delayed production of ROS tended to be higher in the case of 5-ALA treatment before rather than after ionizing irradiation. These results suggest that 5-ALA can affect tumor cells under ionizing irradiation, and greatly increase secondary intracellular production of ROS long after ionizing irradiation, thereby causing a radiosensitizing effect in glioma cells.",Excluded

1311,"Substantial radiation exposure for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage Increasing attention is being paid to the cancer risk conferred by imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT). Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) often are critically ill and require numerous imaging studies. A nonradiating diagnostic modality, transcranial Doppler (TCD), effectively screens for cerebral vasospasm. But when TCD is not available, CT angiography or conventional angiography may be ordered, increasing a patient's total radiation dose. This study investigated the total amount of radiation to which patients with SAH are exposed, and whether that amount was decreased by the availability of TCD. Patients with nontraumatic SAH who were admitted to an intensive care unit within 48 hours of symptom onset and who survived and remained hospitalized for at least 7 days were eligible. TCD was available for one group (TCD group) but not for the other group (no-TCD group). The total radiation dose for each patient was tallied. There were no differences in demographic variables or significant difference in radiation exposure between the 2 groups. Average total radiation exposure was 82.03 mSv in the TCD group and 89.79 mSv in the no-TCD group (P=.60). Head imaging accounted for 97.2% of the total radiation exposure in the TCD group and 90% of that in the no-TCD group. Patients with SAH are exposed to a substantial amount of radiation, almost all of which is centered on the head. Using Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII cancer risk estimates, the average lifetime attributable risk from SAH management was approximately 1 in 125.

1904,"Intraoperative pulmonary embolism during craniotomy: A case report Background: Acute intraoperative pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious, yet rare, life-threatening event that requires swift diagnosis and intervention. Rudolf Virchow first described his famous triad of risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) >100 years ago and it remains relevant today: venous stasis, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulable state.1 Further, there is up to a 5-fold increase in the incidence of PE in the perioperative period.1 We present a case of intraoperative pulmonary embolism in a patient with known risk factors while undergoing craniotomy for tumor resection for recurrent malignancy. Case Presentation: A 52-year-old male with a history of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) status post prior resection, chemotherapy, and radiation, GERD, HTN, and obesity presented for tumor resection. Per clinical trial, patient could not receive any medications that affected CYP3A4. Twenty minutes after induction, patient started to display hemodynamic instability and had hypoxemic episodes that responded, initially, to recruitment breath maneuvers. At that time, a baseline ABG was drawn that revealed a large PaCO<inf>2</inf> end-tidal CO<inf>2</inf> gradient, which raised suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolus. Shortly thereafter, hemodynamic instability ensued, and patient was up-titrated on vasopressors: phenylephrine, then norepinephrine and epinephrine. Surgery was aborted before entering the cranial vault, and interventional radiology (IR) was contacted. Patient was transported to IR for catheterization of pulmonary arteries and was found to have massive bilateral pulmonary embolisms and subsequently systemically heparinized. Infusion catheters were placed in bilateral arteries, and tPa boluses were started for clot lysis. After boluses, patient regained some hemodynamic stability, but remained on high-dose vasopressor infusions. Bilateral infusion catheters were left in place, patient was transported to neurosurgical ICU on norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin infusions, and nitric oxide was started. Overnight, patient was weaned off norepinephrine, and oxygenation and ventilation improved. He remained on nitric oxide and catheter-directed thrombolysis. Despite cardiopulmonary improvement, patient's family elected to withdraw care given his poor prognosis with or without tumor resection. Discussion(s): An increase in alveolar dead space is associated with pulmonary thromboembolism with high sensitivity and specificity in surgical patients,1 in addition to cardiopulmonary compromise. Studies have shown a statistically significant reduction in mortality in patients with major PE who received directed thrombolysis compared with systemic heparin alone.1 Regardless of intervention, mortality in hemodynamically unstable patients with PE remains as high as 30%.2.",Excluded

We previously showed that D609 mimics glutathione. D609 has a free thiol group, which upon oxidation forms a disulfide. The resulting dixanthate is a substrate for glutathione reductase, regenerating D609. Recent studies from our laboratory have also shown that D609 reduces the Alzheimer amyloid beta-peptide (1-42)-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in neuronal cell culture. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that D609 would provide neuroprotection against free radical oxidative stress in vivo. Synaptosomes isolated from gerbils, previously injected intraperitoneally (ip) with D609, were treated with the oxidants Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or 2,2-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), which produce free radicals. Synaptosomes isolated from the gerbils ip injected with D609 and treated with Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or AAPH showed significant reduction in reactive oxygen species, levels of protein carbonyl, protein-bound hydroxynonenal (a lipid peroxidation product), and 3-nitrotyrosine (another marker of protein oxidation formed by reaction of tyrosine residues with peroxynitrite) compared to oxidative stress in synaptosomes isolated from gerbils that were injected with saline, but treated with Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H <inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or AAPH.

Compared with initial tumor, node, metastases (TNM) stage, cases that showed a lower TNM stage after treatment were defined as 'downstaging.' The relationship between downstaging and OS was analyzed, and a subgroup analysis on the responders was performed.RESULTS: After first-line treatment, 78 (37.1%) patients achieved complete response, 97 (46.2%) achieved PR, and 35 (16.7%) experienced stable disease or progressive disease. A hundred and fifty one patients (71.9%) showed downstaging of their diseases, and the remaining 59 patients (28.1%) showed no change or upstaging. The median OS for patients achieving downstaging and no change/upstaging were 32.8 months and 13.1 months, respectively (P < .001). Of the 97 patients who achieved PR, the OS was significantly longer in patients who showed downstaging than those who did not (25.8 months vs. 13.8 months, respectively; P = .004). In multivariate analyses, female sex, downstaging, lower initial TNM stage, and prophylactic cranial irradiation were independent good prognostic factors for OS.CONCLUSION: Downstaging might be an independent good prognostic factor in LD-SCLC. Specifically, downstaging is expected to be useful for stratification of patients achieving PR. Further prospective studies are warranted to verify whether patients who achieved PR without downstaging can be candidates for consolidation treatments after first-line treatment.",Excluded

No prior chest imaging was available. Patient was discharged after appendectomy and was advised to have follow up imaging, but was thereafter lost to follow up. Two years later patient presented with productive cough and scant hemoptysis. A CTscan of the chest then revealed a 6.7 cm lung mass. Carcinoid tumor was suspected but octreotide scan was negative. A CT guided lung biopsy revealed adeno-carcinoma positive for EGFR mutation. Three weeks later patient was admitted with headache and right arm weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed left sided metastases in parietal and occipital lobe, confirming stage IV disease IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Risk of a lung nodule being malignant depends on size, consistency and patient risk factors. The risk of malignancy in a nodule of 5 mm is < 1 %, 5-9 mm is 2-6%, 8-20 mm is 18% and > 20 mm is 50%. Solid nodules are at greater risk than semi solid and ground glass nodules. Significant risk factors include cigarette smoking, age> 35 years, female gender, exposure to radiation or environmental toxins, pulmonary fibrosis, alcohol consumption and positive family history. According to Fleischner society guidelines a lung nodule > 8 mm should be either resected for biopsy in patients with risk factors for lung cancer, or followed up with CT chest in 3 months in low risk patients. In patients under 35 years old with no risk factors, the chance of a lung nodule proving to be malignant is < 3%. It has also been noted that patients with nodules between 8-30 mm and concern of poor follow up (due to socioeconomic status, psychological issues, young age) should undergo either non-surgical biopsy or video assisted thoracoscopic surgery with wedge resection. Lung adenocarcinoma commonly presents as a pulmonary nodule. 5 year survival rate of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma is < 10 % while for stage I it is 60-80%. The patient in this case presented 2 years after the finding of an incidental nodule with cancer that had progressed to stage IV. We suggest that timely intervention with biopsy of the nodule on first presentation could have altered this course. Conclusion(s): Guidelines should be used in the proper clinical context as a tool to help in patient management as exceptions always exist. In any patient, including young patients with no risk factors for lung cancer presenting with nodules > 8 mm in size, there should be significant clinical suspicion of malignancy.

2303,"Characterization of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) brain-type fatty acid binding protein (fabp7) genes reveals the fates of teleost fabp7 genes following whole genome duplications Whole genome duplications (WGDs) are considered to have been a driving force in the generation of evolutionary diversity that is characteristic of higher eukaryotes. The ancestor of salmonids underwent two additional WGDs compared to mammals, one (3R) at the base of the teleost radiation and another (4R) in the common ancestor of extant salmonids. We have chosen the fatty acid binding protein (fabp) gene family as a model to study the fate of duplicated genes in teleosts following WGDs. As previously described for zebrafish, we identified two copies (fabp7a and fabp7b) of the brain-type fabp gene in several fish including rainbow smelt, but there was only a single transcript in northern pike, the closest relative of the salmonids, and two rather than the expected four fabp7 genes in Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout and grayling. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that a loss of the fabp7a gene occurred in the common ancestor of the northern pike and salmonids after it had diverged from the rainbow smelt, and that the 4R WGD then gave rise to the fabp7bI and fabp7bII observed in salmonids. This is supported by genetic mapping that placed the Atlantic salmon duplicated fabp7b genes on homeologous chromosomes. There was no evidence of neo-functionalization in the salmonid fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes based on dN/dS ratios and an examination of amino acid substitutions. Atlantic salmon fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes are both expressed broadly like fabp7b expression in northern pike. However, only Atlantic salmon fabp7bII, like its counterpart in northern pike and zebrafish, was expressed in the liver. A comparison of ~ 2000 bp upstream of Atlantic salmon fabp7b gene duplicates revealed an insertion of 62 bp in fabp7bI relative to fabp7bII. The presence of predicted transcription factor binding sites in this insertion sequence may explain the differential expression of the fabp7b gene duplicates in Atlantic salmon liver. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

1353,"Oncolytic herpes simplex virus and radiation combination therapy results in a systemic immune response to inhibit neuroblastoma tumor growth INTRODUCTION: Viral and gene therapy are promising approaches to treating neuroblastoma. An oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) expressing the cytokine Interleukin-12 (M002) was previously shown to inhibit neuroblastoma xenograft growth. We hypothesized that human neuroblastoma tumors express the viral entry receptor, CD111. Additionally, we hypothesized that M002 would produce a secondary immune response to inhibit murine neuroblastoma growth distant from the treatment site in an immunocompetent model. METHOD(S): Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human neuroblastoma tumor specimens (IRB-X111123007) were stained for CD111. NXS2 murine neuroblastoma cells (7.5x10^5 cells) were injected into bilateral flanks of immunocompetent mice (IACUC- 120409363). Established right-sided tumors were treated with M002 (1x107 pfu) and radiation (3Gy).Half of these mice received a repeat right-sided dose of M002 and radiation. Tumor volumes on both flanks were measured every 2 days. Data were compared with appropriate statistical analysis with significance p<=0.05. RESULT(S): All 12 human neuroblastoma specimens expressed CD111. In the murine bilateral flank tumor model, repeat treatment of the right flank with M002 and radiation led to significant inhibition of tumor growth in the untreated flank tumor compared to animals who received a single dose to the right flank (323.44 +/- 215.51 mm3 vs. 955.08 +/- 366.54 mm3, p<=0.05). CONCLUSION(S): CD111 expression was present in human neuroblastoma specimens, indicating that oHSV would infect these tumors. M002 inhibited progression of murine tumors both locally and distant from the site of therapy, demonstrating a systemic effect. These data support the potential use of oHSV therapy to treat recurrent or metastatic neuroblastoma.",Excluded
