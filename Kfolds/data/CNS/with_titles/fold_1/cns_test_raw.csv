1380,"Persistent or recurrent acromegaly. Long-term endocrinologic efficacy and neurologic safety of postsurgical radiation therapy As in other clinics, pituitary surgery was definitive treatment in less than 50% of cases of acromegaly treated at one institution over several decades. From 1965 to 1989, 24 acromegalic patients who had noncurative pituitary surgery received radiation therapy at the National Institutes of Health, with a basal human growth hormone level of greater than 5 ng/ml as the criterion for active disease. Using megavoltage irradiation, more than 60% of these patients stabilized at a normal hormonal range, and the overwhelming majority had decreasing growth hormone levels with time. No major side effects of irradiation were encountered except panhypopituitarism of varying degrees. The authors evolved a policy of surgery as the first option, followed by irradiation for patients with postoperative growth hormone levels more than 5 ng/ml.",Excluded
1296,"Survival of melanoma patients treated with targeted therapy and immunotherapy after systematic upfront control of brain metastases by radiosurgery BACKGROUND: Targeted therapy (TT) and immunotherapies (ITs) have dramatically improved survival in metastatic melanoma (MM). However, their efficacy on brain metastasis (BM) remains limited and poorly documented.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of consecutive MM patients (pts) with BMs, all systematically upfront treated by Gamma-Knife (GK) at first BM and retreated in case of new BMs, from 2010 to 2015 at the time when ipilimumab BRAF +/- MEK inhibitors and anti-PD1 were introduced in practice. Survival after 1st GK (OS<sub>GK1</sub>) according to prognostic factors and treatment.RESULTS: Among 179 consecutive pts treated by GK, 109 received IT and/or TT after the 1st GK. Median OS<sub>GK1</sub> was 10.95 months and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 49.5% and 27.4%, respectively, versus a median overall survival (OS) of 2.29 months (p < .001) in those who did not receive IT or TT. In pts who initially had a single BM, median OS and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 14.46 months, 66.7% and 43.4%, respectively; in pts with 2-3 BMs: 8.85 months, 46.4% and 31%, respectively; in pts with >3 BMs: 7.25 months, 37.2% and 11.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis for OS<sub>GK1</sub> confirmed that IT and TT were significantly and highly protective. Best OS<sub>GK1</sub> was observed in BRAF-wild-type pts receiving anti-PD1 or in BRAF-mutated pts receiving BRAF-inhibitors and anti-PD1 (12.26 and 14.82 months, respectively).CONCLUSION: In real-life MM pts with BMs, a strategy aiming at controlling BM with GK together with TT and/or TT seems to achieve unprecedented survival rates.",Excluded

1344,"Offline Quality Assurance for Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Treatment Plans for NRG-HN001 Head and Neck Clinical Trial Using Knowledge-Based Planning Purpose: This study aimed to investigate whether a disease site-specific, multi-institutional knowledge based-planning (KBP) model can improve the quality of intensity modulated radiation therapy treatment planning for patients enrolled in the head and neck NRG-HN001clinical trial and to establish a threshold of improvements of treatment plans submitted to the clinical trial. Methods and Materials: Fifty treatment plans for patients enrolled in the NRG-HN001 clinical trial were used to build a KBP model; the model was then used to reoptimize 50 other plans. We compared the dosimetric parameters of the submitted and KBP reoptimized plans. We compared differences between KBP and submitted plans for single- and multi-institutional treatment plans. Result(s): Mean values for the dose received by 95% of the planning target volume (PTV_6996) and for the maximum dose (D0.03cc) of PTV_6996 were 0.5 Gy and 2.1 Gy higher in KBP plans than in the submitted plans, respectively. Mean values for D0.03cc to the brain stem, spinal cord, optic nerve_R, optic nerve_L, and chiasm were 2.5 Gy, 1.9 Gy, 6.4 Gy, 6.6 Gy, and 5.7 Gy lower in the KBP plans than in the submitted plans. Mean values for D<inf>mean</inf> to parotid_R and parotid_L glands were 2.2 Gy and 3.8 Gy lower in KBP plans, respectively. In 33 out of 50 KBP plans, we observed improvements in sparing of at least 7 organs at risk (OARs) (brain stem, spinal cord, optic nerves (R & L), chiasm, and parotid glands [R & L]). A threshold of improvement of OARs sparing of 5% of the prescription dose was established for providing the quality assurance results back to the treating institution. Conclusion(s): A disease site-specific, multi-institutional, clinical trial-based KBP model improved sparing of OARs in a large number of reoptimized plans submitted to the NRG-HN001 clinical trial, and the model is being used as an offline quality assurance tool.

1405,"Effect of internal irradiation on the maturing Purkinje cells in the rat. A Golgi study Continuous irradiation in utero is reported to produce mental retardation and gross abnormalities of the brain in the human. A few experimental studies conducted so far also report gross brain defects in animals exposed to continuous irradiation in utero. Despite the increasing use of nuclear energy for power and radioisotopes in medicine, there is hardly any literature available on the effect of continuous irradiation on the structural details of the developing brain. After intraperitoneal injections of different doses of 131I (8, 18 and 32 microCi) and 32P (10 microCi) in new-born rats on the 6th postnatal day, cerebella stained by Golgi techniques were cut sagittally and the sections were examined on the 10th, 15th and 21st postnatal days. In the animals injected with 18 and 32 microCi of 131I and 10 microCi of 32P a large number of Purkinje cells showed morphological alterations not seen in the control groups or in the groups injected with 8 microCi of 131I. The changes observed included persistence of the perisomatic processes beyond the 10th postnatal day, multiple primary dendrites, angulation of the primary dendrites, long segments of primary dendrites without branches and significantly reduced dendritic volume. The number of affected cells was less on the 21st postnatal day. The effective radiation dose estimated in these groups ranged from 15 to 26 rad. Since the rats irradiated with 6 rad had not shown such changes it is believed that there is a threshold dose of radiation beyond which only changes are perceptible at neuronal level.",Excluded
1560,"A phantom study to determine the optimum size of a single collimator for shortening the treatment time in CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery of spherical targets Prolonged treatment execution time is a concern in CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery. Beam reduction and node reduction technique, and monitor unit optimization methods are adopted to reduce the treatment time. Usage of single collimator in the CyberKnife treatment plan can potentially reduce collimator exchange time. An optimal single collimator, which yields an acceptable dose distribution along with minimum number of nodes, beams, and monitor units, can be a versatile alternative for shortening treatment time. The aim of the present study is to find the optimal single collimator in CyberKnife treatment planning to shorten the treatment time with the acceptable dose distribution. A spherical planning target volume PTV1 was drawn in an anthropomorphic head and neck phantom. Plans with same treatment goals were generated for all the 12 collimators independently. D(95%) was selected as the prescribing isodose and the prescribed dose was 10 Gy. The plan of the optimal collimator size was evaluated for conformity, homogeneity, and dose spillage outside the target. The optimum collimator size and the target dimensions were correlated. The study was repeated with two other target volumes PTV2 and PTV3 for generalizing the results. Collimator sizes just above the diameter of the spherical PTVs were yielding least number of nodes and beams with acceptable dose distributions. The collimator size of 35 mm is optimum for the PTV1, whose diameter is 31.4 mm. Similarly, 50 mm collimator is optimum for PTV2 (diameter= 45.2 mm) and 20 mm collimator is optimum for PTV3 (Diameter = 17.3 mm). The total number of monitor units is found to reduce with increasing collimator size. Optimal single collimator is found to be useful for shortening the treatment time in spherical targets. Studies on two clinical targets, (a brain metastasis and a liver metastasis cases) show comparable results with the phantom study.",Excluded
1983,"[Brain lesions after radiotherapy] On the basis of literature reports up to 1988 the incidence, clinical pattern and treatment of cerebral complications following radiotherapy administered to the organs and tissues of the head are discussed. Acute radiation-induced reaction and early delayed reaction in the form of e.g. the so called somnolence syndrome or rhombencephalopathy are rare and their prognosis is usually good. In 1 to 14% of the patients delayed reaction may develop corresponding to the late radiation necrosis, usually with progressive unfavourable course. A problem of practical importance is the impossibility of differentiating radiation-induced cerebral necrosis from recurrence, expansion of the primary tumour or metastatic tumour, even using CT and MNR. Only the poorly available positron emission tomography makes possible differential diagnosis. Sometimes, surgical or pharmacological treatment of cerebral necrosis is effective.

1848,"Repeatability of PET with <sup>89</sup>Zirconium-labeled monoclonal antibodies for quantification of antibody biodistribution Objectives: PET with <sup>89</sup>Zirconium (<sup>89</sup>Zr) labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be used for in vivo quantification of antibody biodistribution and may improve prediction of efficacy and toxicity of mAb treatment. Knowledge about repeatability of these measurements is required to ensure correct interpretation, especially when assessing differences between antibody biodistributions. However, repeatability of <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb PET is unknown, as radiation exposure is significant, thereby limiting test-retest studies. The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of image reconstruction to the repeatability of tissue uptake of <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb for quantification of antibody biodistribution. Method(s): Three clinical <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb PET datasets were included: <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD20 (1, 72, 144 h post injection (p.i.) of 74MBq, n=7), <sup>89</sup>Zr-cetuximab (1, 72, 144 h p.i. of 37MBq, n=7) and <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD44 (1, 24, 96 h p.i. of 37MBq, n=13). For all original images tissue volumes of interest (VOI) were defined. Manual delineation of complete organs (volume range 107-4377 mL) was used to obtain liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain VOI. Fixed size VOI of 2.1 and 8.6 mL were placed in aortic arch and lumbar vertebrae to sample blood pool and bone marrow, respectively. Next, original PET list mode data were split before reconstruction, simulating test-retest scans. All VOI were applied to these test-retest scans. Mean activity concentrations (AC) were derived from these VOI. Repeatability was assessed using Bland-Altman plots (percentage difference versus mean activity concentration in Bq/mL, limits of agreement (LOA)), and repeatability coefficients (RC) were calculated (1.96xSD of the mean percentage difference). Result(s): Repeatability for all mAbs decreased with time. For <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD44 (18MBq), RCs were 8.0, 10.4 and 16.5% at 1, 24 and 96 h p.i., respectively. RCs for larger, manual VOIs were 7.2%, while RCs for smaller, fixed size VOIs were 28% at 96 h p.i. (Figure 1). For <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD20 (18MBq)/<sup>89</sup>Zr-cetuximab (18MBq), RCs for all VOIs were 13.7/9.9, 17.9/14.9 and 26.1/24.6% at 1, 72 and 144 h p.i., respectively. For a higher injected dose, repeatability improved. For 37MBq of <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD20, RCs were 8.2, 9.9 and 22.6% at 1, 72 and 144 hours p.i., respectively. Conclusion(s): For large, manually delineated tissue VOI a lower RC was obtained compared with smaller, fixed sized VOI. In general, RC of tissue uptake of <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb was around 15 and 25% for imaging at 72 and 144 h p.i., respectively. Changes in biodistribution beyond this established range of repeatability are likely due to biological effects.",Excluded

1282,"Helical tomotherapy in advanced and recurrence head and neck cancer: Preliminary results Introduction/Background/Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) by Helical Tomotherapy (HT) in patients affected by advanced and recurrence head and neck cancer. In both cases difficulties exist in treating large volumes near organs at risk (OAR) with high dose levels. Particularly, more difficulties can occur in cases of re-irradiation. HT allows this kind of treatment by using of IMRT technique with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) associated with daily IGRT. Materials and Methods/Patients and Methods: Between October 2010 and April 2011 thirteen patients (9 male and 4 female) with advanced or recurrence head and neck cancer were enrolled in our study; in particular: 3 primary cutaneous advanced carcinoma (involving orbital and/or paranasal cavities), 4 recurrences after previous radiotherapy in the same site, 7 advanced head and neck cancer. The mean age was 63.2 years. Six patients received concomitant chemotherapy platinum-based. All patients underwent fiber-optic endoscopy, CT imaging and MRI imaging for staging. All patients also underwent 18-FDG-PET-CT virtual-simulation for treatment planning. All patients received a supportive odontostomatological and nutritional protocol. The treatment volumes were: the gross tumor volume and positive nodes (as visible at imaging) irradiated with curative doses (66-70.5 Gy in 30 fractions, 2.2-2.35 Gy/die); nodal levels at higher risk irradiated with prophylactic doses (60 Gy/30 fractions); loco-regional nodes irradiated with prophylactic doses (54 Gy/30 fractions). The countered organ at risk were: brain, brainstem, chiasm, optic nerve, lens, spinal cord, parotid glands, mandible, temporal-mandibular joint. In patients previously irradiated the prior treatment planning was reviewed in order to evaluate the overlapping of the irradiated volumes. Results were evaluated in terms of acute and sub-acute toxicity and clinical outcome. Toxicity was evaluated according to RTOG-EORTC scale. Fiber-optic endoscopy was performed 1 month after the end of radiotherapy. CT, MRI and PET-CT imaging were performed 3 months after treatment. Result(s): All patients completed the treatment. One patient required interruption of treatment for 2 days. Five patients required infusion medical therapy, during radiotherapy, with corticosteroids, antibiotics, anti-fungal, analgesics and antiinflammatory drugs and parenteral nutrition. Acute skin toxicity was: G1 in 9 patients, G2 in 2 patients, G3 in 1 patient. Acute mucous toxicity was: G1 in 8 patients, G2 in 4 patients, G3 in 1 patient. For three patients re-planning during radiation treatment was necessary because of relevant tumor volume reduction. Three patients have a complete clinical response during treatment, confirmed at post-treatment imaging. Five patients have a partial clinical response > 50% at the end of RT, confirmed at post-treatment imaging. Two patients have a partial clinical response < 50%, and 2 patients a stable disease after RT, confirmed at posttreatment imaging. The last patient had no sufficient follow-up to evaluate response. Late toxicity was not evaluated because of the short follow-up. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Our initial experience shows that HT allows delivering of high radiation doses to the tumor volume with good precision resulting from to the ability to verify daily set-up patients by megavoltage cone beam CT. Dose escalation results in objective clinical responses already during radiation treatment with possibility of re-planning, allowing for adaptive radiotherapy. Relevant toxicity, particularly in patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy, requires close monitoring of patients and supportive care to allow completing treatment. Our supportive odontostomatological and nutritional protocol is useful in this regard. Our results are absolutely preliminary, PET-CT is mandatory for contouring before the treatment and during radiotherapy for re-planning and also at the of radiotherapy for quantitative response evaluation. Further follow up is necessary to evaluate long term outcome and late toxicity.",Excluded
2282,"Effects of cell phone (900 and 1800 MHz) and Wi-Fi (2450 MHz) frequencies on oxidative stress in laryngeal mucosa The trachea has a composite structure with individual and incomplete cartilaginous rings. Deformation of trachea through surgical process and mechanical applications induces injury of laryngotracheal mucosa (Hussain et al. 2015). Results of recent studies studying the oxidative related values in larynx cancer indicated the importance of oxidative stress. Main reactive oxygen species (ROS) are superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. Production normal level of ROS is a physiological process, because the ROS has been using for physiological functions such as killing bacteria and viruses in the body. The excessive production of ROS is scavenged by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. 900 and 1800 MHz frequencies are used in cell phones in several countries including Turkey, although 2450 MHz has been using as Wi-Fi frequency in the countries. The non-ionize cell phone and Wi-Fi frequencies induce their hazardous effects in cells including laryngeal mucosa by excessive production of ROS. Results of recent papers indicated that the antioxidant levels such as glutathione and glutathione peroxidase were decreased in the laryngeal mucosa of animals by the cell phone and Wi-Fi exposures, but oxidative stress levels were increased by the exposures (Aynali et al. 2013). In the oral presentation, I will summarize the results of recent papers on oxidative stress and antioxidants in neurons and cells including laryngeal mucosa.

Goal: To explore features and cerebral basis of ""radiation"" PTSD in the Chernobyl accident survivors. Subjects and methods: The cross-sectional study included 241 people, 219 of whom have been diagnosed with PTSD according to the DSM-IV criteria, among them 115 clean-up workers [liquidators] of the Chernobyl accident (34 with acute radiation sickness), 76 evacuees from the Chernobyl exclusion zone, 28 veterans of the war in Afghanistan, and 22 healthy unexposed individuals. Psychometric examinations, neurocognitive assessments, computerized electroencephalography, and cerebral vascular Doppler were used. Result(s): ""Radiation"" PTSD includes: ""flashforward"" phenomenon and anticipating stress (projection of fear and danger to the future); somatoform disorders, depression, trait and state anxiety; neurocognitive deficit (impaired memory and attention, auditory-verbal memory and learning, proactive and retroactive interference; cerebellar and stem symptoms, intellectual changes). The intima-media component thickness of common carotid arteries, and common and left internal carotid arteries stenosis rates are increased in the liquidators. Changes of bioelectrical brain activity as a decrease of beta- and theta-power together with an increase of alpha-power were found in the Chernobyl accident survivors with PTSD.

Background: Immune-modulatory proteins HLA-G and HLA-E were originally thought to be restricted to the protection of the fetus from maternal allorecognition. Now they are known for multiple immune-regulatory functions. We already described production of immune-modulatory molecules HLA-G and HLA-E by both microglial cells (Kren, L. et al., J Neuroimmunol 2010) and neoplastic cells (Kren, L. et al. Neuropathology 2011). We described the unexpected positive correlation of HLA-E expression by neoplastic cells in glioblastoma (GB) with the length of survival, which we hypothetized could be attributable to subsequent therapeutic modalities. Therefore, we decided to analyse the expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in three GB cell lines before and after the impact of ionizing radiation. Design(s): We used three GB cell lines: T 98G, A172 and U 87MG. The expression of HLA-G and HLA-E was assessed before application of ionizing radiation (0-2-5-10-15- 20 Gy) and then was analysed again 24h and 72 h after radiation. HLA-G and HLA-E antigens were analysed flow-cytometrically. Result(s): The expression of both HLA-G and HLA-E by all three cell lines of GB was elevated significantly after irradiation, expecially expression of HLA-E in the line T 98G. (Graph Presented) Conclusion(s): We revealed that expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in GB cell lines alters significantly after the impact of ionizing radiation. This finding may represent a new, unrecognized pathway of the effect of ionizing radiation in cancer therapy. In GB, namely, HLA-E may function, in its elevated levels, as a ligand for activating receptor CD94/NKG2C, therefore mediating increased lysis of tumor cells.",Excluded
1962,"Extravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia mimicking neoplasm after radiosurgery: case report BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Papillary endothelial hyperplasia (PEH) is a rare form of exuberant reactive endothelial proliferation that can mimic neoplasm. We report the largest series of patients with histologically confirmed intracranial extravascular PEH developing in the field of previous treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery.CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We collected the clinical, radiological, surgical, and pathological findings from 4 patients in whom intracranial extravascular PEH developed after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery. In all patients, the development of an enlarging hemorrhagic mass lesion at the site of previous radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging was radiographically suspicious for neoplasm and prompted biopsy or resection. All 4 patients elected to undergo biopsy or surgical resection. Histological examination of the biopsy and resection specimens in all patients demonstrated the classic features of PEH.CONCLUSION: The interval to the development of PEH ranged from 5 months to 6 years, 10 months. Clinical follow-up was available for 3 of the 4 patients. None of these 3 patients have demonstrated evidence of recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 22 months (range, 15-30 months). These patients share common radiological features, potentially allowing preoperative diagnosis and improved guidance of clinical management. These cases suggest a link between radiosurgery and the development of PEH. These findings also suggest that PEH should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients treated with radiosurgery in whom a hemorrhagic mass lesion subsequently develops at or near the site of previous treatment. We think that complete surgical excision is the best treatment for intracranial PEH.",Excluded
2115,"Inhibition of rhodopsin kinase by recoverin. Further evidence for a negative feedback system in phototransduction Recoverin is a 23-kDa Ca(2+)-binding protein found predominantly in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Recent electrophysiological and biochemical studies suggest that recoverin may regulate the photoresponse by inhibiting rhodopsin phosphorylation. We find in both cell homogenates and reconstituted systems that the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by recoverin occurs over a significantly higher free Ca2+ range than previously reported. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at 1.5-3 microM free Ca2+ and is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2. Measurements of transducin activation demonstrate that this inhibition prolongs the lifetime of catalytically active rhodopsin. Ca(2+)-recoverin directly inhibits rhodopsin kinase activity, and Ca(2+)-dependent binding of recoverin to rod outer segment membranes is not required for its action. Extrapolation of the in vitro data to in vivo conditions based on simple mass action calculations places the Ca(2+)-recoverin regulation within the physiological free Ca2+ range in intact rod outer segment. The data are consistent with a model in which the fall in free Ca2+ that accompanies rod excitation exerts negative feedback by relieving inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation.",Excluded

Motoneurons were divided into two classes based on intrinsic properties. The first class exhibited higher impedance (123.0 +/- 11.0 MOmega), wider spikes (0.99 +/- 0.05 ms), a single spike afterhyperpolarization (AHP), little or no spike frequency adaptation (SFA), and anomalous rectification, characterized by an initial ""sag"" in membrane potential in response to hyperpolarizing current injection. The second class exhibited lower impedance (21.8 +/- 2.5 MOmega), narrower spikes (0.74 +/- 0.03 ms), a double AHP, substantial SFA, and little or no rectification. Vestibular responses were evoked by horizontal sinusoidal rotation (1/12-1/3 Hz; peak velocity: 30-100 degrees /s). Spiking in higher-impedance cells was recruited earlier in the response and exhibited a more limited dynamic range relative to that of lower impedance cells. Spiking evoked by injecting depolarizing current during rotation was blocked during contraversive motion and was consistent with a shunting inhibition. No morphological features were identified in neurobiotin-filled cells that correlated with the two physiological classes. Recovered motoneurons were multipolar but exhibited a less-complex dendritic morphology than ocular motoneurons of similarly sized mammals. The two physiologically defined cell classes have homologues in other vertebrates, suggesting that intrinsic membrane properties play an important role in oculomotor processing.",Excluded

1843,"The cyberknife as a perfect tool for new therapeutic challenges in radiotherapy. [French] The ""wholy grale"" in radiotherapy is the search for a treatment as conformal as possible allowing to apply very high doses on the target while leaving healthy tissues as much as possible outside the prescription isodose. Radiotherapy is characterized by a never ending technical evolution aiming at increasing biological efficacy on the target while reducing toxicity at the level of the surrounding organs at risk. One of the by-products of this ever lasting quest to precision and dose concentration is the concept of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions. For a long time the technique has only been available for cranial non-moving targets, as high precision and moving targets have long been considered antinomic for technical reasons. The clinical need to apply these same concepts for extra-cranial locations, potentially suitable to move during the irradiations, has been a booster to develop informatics and robotics.

The same cases were re-planned using a test version of mMLC-based radiosurgery software for multiple static non-coplanar fields.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: For non-spherical targets, treatment planning is relatively intuitive with mMLC-based radiosurgery, reducing the amount of time required for planning. Moreover, a lower dose of radiation is delivered to normal tissue with mMLC-based radiosurgery than with arc-based radiosurgery, which theoretically should lead to a reduced risk of complications.",Excluded
1835,"Dose Assessment in Computed Tomography Examination and Establishment of Local Diagnostic Reference Levels in Mazandaran, Iran BACKGROUND: Medical X-rays are the largest man-made source of public exposure to ionizing radiation. While the benefits of Computed Tomography (CT) are well known in accurate diagnosis, those benefits are not risk-free. CT is a device with higher patient dose in comparison with other conventional radiation procedures.OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating radiation dose to patients from Computed Tomography (CT) examination in Mazandaran hospitals and defining diagnostic reference level (DRL).METHODS: Patient-related data on CT protocol for four common CT examinations including brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic were collected. In each center, Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI) measurements were performed using pencil ionization chamber and CT dosimetry phantom according to AAPM report No. 96 for those techniques. Then, Weighted Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIW), Volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI vol) and Dose Length Product (DLP) were calculated.RESULTS: The CTDIw for brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic ranged (15.6-73), (3.8-25. 8), (4.5-16.3) and (7-16.3), respectively. Values of DLP had a range of (197.4-981), (41.8-184), (131-342.3) and (283.6-486) for brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic, respectively. The 3rd quartile of CTDIW, derived from dose distribution for each examination is the proposed quantity for DRL. The DRLs of brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic are measured 59.5, 17, 7.8 and 11 mGy, respectively.CONCLUSION: Results of this study demonstrated large scales of dose for the same examination among different centers. For all examinations, our values were lower than international reference doses.",Excluded

Here, we show that the Ti:Sapphire laser in a multiphoton microscope can be used to cause localized damage within unlabeled cells or tissues at greater depths than previously possible.

A characteristic fluorescent scar allows monitoring of the damage and identifies the wound site in later observations. We were able to lesion a single axon within a bundle of nerves, locally interrupt organelle transport within one axon, cut dendrites in a zebrafish embryo, ablate a mitotic pole in a sea urchin egg, and wound the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope in starfish oocytes. The starfish nucleus collapsed approximately 1 h after wounding, indicating that loss of compartmentation barrier makes the structure unstable; surprisingly, the oocyte still completed meiotic divisions when exposed to maturation hormone, indicating that the compartmentalization and translocation of cdk1 and its regulators is not required for this process.

Considering the recent reports about some hazardous effects of Wi-Fi signals on the nervous system, this study aimed to investigate the effect of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi radiation on multisensory integration in rats. This experimental study was done on 80 male Wistar rats that were allocated into exposure and sham groups. Wi-Fi exposure to 2.4 GHz microwaves [in Service Set Identifier mode (23.6 dBm and 3% for power and duty cycle, respectively)] was done for 30 days (12 h/day). Cross-modal visual-tactile object recognition (CMOR) task was performed by four variations of spontaneous object recognition (SOR) test including standard SOR, tactile SOR, visual SOR, and CMOR tests. A discrimination ratio was calculated to assess the preference of animal to the novel object. The expression levels of M1 and GAT1 mRNA in the hippocampus were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Results demonstrated that rats in Wi-Fi exposure groups could not discriminate significantly between the novel and familiar objects in any of the standard SOR, tactile SOR, visual SOR, and CMOR tests. The expression of M1 receptors increased following Wi-Fi exposure. In conclusion, results of this study showed that chronic exposure to Wi-Fi electromagnetic waves might impair both unimodal and cross-modal encoding of information.",Excluded

1475,"Effectiveness of Radiation Protection Caps for Lowering dose to the Brain and the Eye Lenses Purpose: This work was designed to study the effectiveness of radiation protection caps in lowering the dose to the brain and the eye lens during fluoroscopically guided interventions. Material(s) and Method(s): Two types of radiation protection caps were examined with regards to their capacity to lower the radiation dose. One cap is equipped with lateral flaps, the other one is not. These caps were fitted to the head of an anthropomorphic Alderson-Rando (A.-R.) phantom. The phantom was positioned aside an angiographic table simulating the position of the first operator during a peripheral arterial intervention. One of the brain slices and both eyes of the A.-R. phantom were equipped with thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs). Result(s): The analysis of the data showed that the cap without lateral flaps reduced the dose to the brain by 11,5-27,5 percent depending on the position within the brain. The cap with lateral protection flaps achieved a shielding effect between 44,7 and 78,9 percent. When evaluating the dose to the eye, we did see an increase of dose reduction from 63,3 to 66,5 percent in the left eye and from 45,8 to 46,8 percent in the right eye for the cap without lateral protection. When wearing the cap with lateral protection we observed an increase of dose reduction from 63,4 to 67,2 percent in the left eye and from 45,8 to 50,0 percent in the right eye. Conclusion(s): Radiation protection caps can be an effective tool to reduce the dose to the brain and the eyes.

2087,"Effect of in utero radiation dose fractionation on rat postnatal development, behavior and brain structure: 3-Hour interval We have previously shown that exposure of the rat fetus to ionizing radiation produces dose-dependent (0.25-1.25 Gy) changes in postnatal growth and behavior, and decreases in cerebral cortex thickness. Pregnant rats were exposed to single doses of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy, or to two doses of 0.5 Gy (separated by a 3 h interval) on gestational day 15. Pups were weighed and subjected to behavioral tests (righting reflex; reflex suspension; negative geotaxis; continuous corridor; and length, width, and sine of gait) over postnatal days 7-28. The rats were then sacrificed and brains removed for histology. The fractionated doses produced responses that were generally intermediate between those produced by the single doses and which, by interpolation, could be expressed as equivalent to a single dose between 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. Overall, exposure of the fetal rat to two doses of 0.5 Gy separated by 3 h produced effects equivalent to a single dose of 0.85 Gy. We conclude that fractionation of radiation dose results in less damage to the developing rat cerebral cortex, as measured by postnatal growth, behavioral tests, and morphological assessment.",Excluded

1280,"Glycoprotein 41 Targeted Radioimmunotherapy as a Novel Treatment for NeuroHIV/AIDS The HIV epidemic is a major global health threat. Nowadays HIV-infected individuals live much longer due to the inhibition of the viral replication by combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART). However, cART fails to eradicate the residual HIV-infected cells, therefore, virus persists and continues to cause damage both systemically and to central nervous system (CNS). HIV enters the CNS in infected monocytes shortly after peripheral exposure. The infection of CNS poses a challenge due to strict regulation of the entry of molecules into the brain by the blood brain barrier (BBB) which limits many cART regimens from reaching effective levels in the brain. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) uses antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for targeted delivery of cytocidal ionizing radiations to cells. The distinct advantages of RIT are its relative independence from the immune status of the patient and secondly, it is not subject to drug resistance mechanisms. These features are very useful in the management of HIV-infected individuals. The challenge in extending the RIT approach to the elimination of HIV in the CNS lies in the difficulty of the therapeutic molecules to penetrate through the BBB. Recently we have demonstrated that an antibody 2556 to gp41 was able to penetrate the in vitro human BBB and to kill infected cells in the brain compartment of the BBB model (McFarren et al AIDS 2016). In this study we have identified six human mAbs with higher pI (> 8.5) that recognizes a conserved region of HIV gp41. The penetration of these antibodies through in vitro human BBB model was pI dependent. We are now using these novel gp41-binding human mAbs conjugated with three different radioisotopes (<sup>213</sup>Bi, <sup>188</sup>Re or <sup>177</sup>Lu) enabling their more efficient penetration into the CNS through the intact BBB. To achieve this, monocytes are infected with HIV and then treated with radiolabelled mAbs. Finally, to validate these novel radiolabeled molecules, we will use a human in vitro BBB model to assess the ability of these mAbs to penetrate the BBB and to kill the HIV infected monocytes in the brain compartment of the BBB model. This study will provide a novel treatment option for the eradication of HIV-1 infection and will also be useful for treatment of drug-resistant HIV strains.

""Recurrent responses to non-small-cell lung cancer brain metastases with erlotinib"", we wish to report a similar case and to provide comments. A 32-year-old Chinese never-smoker female presented a primary lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastasis and three subsequent responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib). Direct sequencing of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene exons 18 to 21 and K-ras gene was performed on tissue obtained from initial biopsies and post-chemotherapy surgical specimens. An EGFR exon 21 L858R point mutation was identified on pre- and post-chemotherapy samples. K-ras mutations and EGFR exon 20 T790M point mutations were not detected. Moreover, EGFR protein overexpression was observed by immunohistochemistry as well as EGFR gene high polysomy by fluorescent in situ hybridization. These case suggest that re-challenging patients with NSCLC several times with EGFR-TKI should be considered when progressive disease is observed under chemotherapy. However, we do not yet know whether this option should be considered in light of tumor molecular evaluation, or whether it should be proposed to patients who experienced a clinical response after a first administration.

1370,"Parietal rTMS disrupts the initiation but not the execution of on-line adjustments to a perturbation of object size Previous studies have implicated the human parietal lobes in the on-line guidance of action. However, no study to date has examined at what stage in the on-line adjustment process do the parietal lobes play their most critical role. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied over the left intraparietal sulcus as participants reached to grasp a small or large illuminated cylinder. On some trials, the illumination could suddenly switch from the small to large cylinder, or vice-versa. Small-Large switches were associated with relatively early grip aperture adjustments, whereas Large-Small switches were associated with relatively late grip aperture adjustments. When rTMS was applied early in the movement, it disrupted on-line adjustments to Small-Large target switches, but not to Large-Small switches. Conversely, when rTMS was applied late in the movement, it disrupted adjustments to Large-Small target switches but not to Small-Large switches. The timing of the disruption by rTMS appeared linked to the initiation of the adjustment. It was concluded that the left parietal lobe plays a critical role in initiating an on-line adjustment to a change in target size, but not in executing that adjustment. The implications of these results for current views of on-line control are discussed.",Excluded
1269,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation of primary motor cortex affects mental rotation Neuroimaging studies have shown that motor structures are activated not only during overt motor behavior but also during tasks that require no overt motor behavior, such as motor imagery and mental rotation. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the primary motor cortex is needed for mental rotation by using single- pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Single-pulse TMS was delivered to the representation of the hand in left primary motor cortex while participants performed mental rotation of pictures of hands and feet. Relative to a peripheral magnetic stimulation control condition, response times (RTs) were slower when TMS was delivered at 650 ms but not at 400 ms after stimulus onset. The magnetic stimulation effect at 650 ms was larger for hands than for feet. These findings demonstrate that (i) activation of the left primary motor cortex has a causal role in the mental rotation of pictures of hands; (ii) this role is stimulus-specific because disruption of neural activity in the hand area slowed RTs for pictures of hands more than feet; and (iii) left primary motor cortex is involved relatively late in the mental rotation process.",Excluded

But it was only slightly sensitive to gamma-ray, MMS, MNNG, MTC and histidine. It showed an unusual photoreactivation response. Its time course of photorecovery was similar to the photoreactivation-defective strain upr-1 of Neurospora crassa. Mutation induction by UV at the ad-3 loci in this mutant strain was lower than that at the same loci in the wild-type strain. The uvs-(SA3B) mutant maps between met-1 and col-4 in linkage group IV, and it was not allelic with the mutagen-sensitive mutant mus-8 which is located in this area.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to microstructural changes in white matter not always detectable with ordinary MRI. We evaluated relationships between DTI parameters and clinical profiles in INPH patients, along with differences in these DTI measures between CSF tap test (CSFTT) responders and non-responders. Method(s): Fifty-four INPH patients (26 CSFTT responders and 28 CSFTT non-responders) constituted the final group for analysis. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were assessed using atlas-based tract mapping methods for 12 different fiber tracts. Result(s): CSFTT non-responders, when compared to responders, showed lower FA values in the left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and left cingulum-hippocampus (CgH). The associations between clinical symptoms of INPH and DTI measures were most commonly found in the CgH. Higher MD in the CgH correlated with poorer cognitive performance. Higher MD in the right CgH also correlated with gait or motor dysfunction. Lower FA in the right CgH was correlated with urinary disturbance and cognitive impairment. Lower FA values in the corticospinal tract (CST) and right ATR significantly correlated with poorer cognitive performance, and correlated with gait dysfunction. Higher MD in left CST correlated with cognitive impairment. Conclusion(s): Our findings may suggest a possibility for considering microstructural changes in white matter in ventriculomegaly patients as potential imaging markers for the prediction of CSFTT responders.

1669,"N-desmethylclozapine an M1 receptor agonist enhances nitric oxide's cardiac vagal facilitation in the isolated innervated rat right atrium We have previously determined that neuronal nitric oxide (NO) may partly mediate its established cholinergic effect via activation of muscarinic type 1 (M1) receptors located at the preganglionic/postganglionic synapse. In this series of experiments we set out to confirm this finding using an M1 agonist. Experiments were carried out on the isolated vagally innervated right atrium in the presence of atenolol (4 microM). The right vagus was stimulated at 4, 8, 16, 32 Hz; pulse duration 1 ms at 20 V for 20 s and the effect on cardiac interval (ms) assessed. N-desmethylclozapine (100 nM), a potent M1 agonist, enhanced the vagally induced increase in cardiac interval, a lower concentration of 50 nM had no significant effect on cardiac interval. This effect was prevented by pre-treatment of the atria with the neuronal NO synthase inhibitor 1 (2-trifluoromethylphenyl)imidazole (TRIM) at 0.14 mM. The vagal stimulation protocol was repeated in order to rule out a reduction in vagal effectiveness which may have been due to the experimental stimulation protocol used in this study. TRIM (0.14 mM) alone causes a small but significant attenuation of the vagally induced increase in cardiac interval. These results show that agonism of M1 receptors on cardiac vagal preganglionic fibres enhances vagal cardiac effects which can be prevented by a neuronal NO inhibitor.",Excluded

Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with recurrent or progressive gliomas received re-irradiation between 1996 and 2011. The median age of the patients was 43 years (range, 20-63 years). Pathologic subtypes were glioblastomas in 21 patients (58.3%), WHO grade III astrocytomas in 8 patients (22.2%), and WHO grade I/II astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas in 7 patients (19.4%). In 27 patients, re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas was preceded by subtotal (19/36; 52.8%) or total (8/36; 22.2%) tumor resection. The median time interval between initial radiation therapy (RT) and re-irradiation was 30.5 months (range, 4-173 months). Radiation doses of the first and second radiation course were 32.4-70.0 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) and 30.0-64.6 Gy (median 45 Gy). The cumulative radiation doses were 82.8-123.0 Gy (median 100.2 Gy), and the median cumulative biological equivalent doses (BED) were 195.8 (a/b = 2 Gy) and 102.3 Gy (a/b = 10 Gy). All patients were followed-up until death or the time of analysis. Result(s): Thirty-two patients died of disease 2-50 months after re-irradiation and one patient was alive with disease 12 months after re-irradiation. Three patients are alive without disease 8-50 months after re-irradiation. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.5 months (range, 2-50 months), and the 6 and 12months OS rates were 83.3 and 39.4%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.5 months, and 6-months and 12-months PFS rates were 71.09 and 41.7%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <=70 (p<0.001), the dose of re-irradiation <=40 Gy(p = 0.019), and the length of time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation(p = 0.029) were associated with improvement in OS. In multivariate analysis, KPS (p=0.033) was the most important predictors for OS. Histologic subtype (GBM vs non-GBM, median OS, 8 vs 12 months, p=0.668) and surgical resection (median OS, 9 vs 12 months, p = 0.810) had no significant benefit on OS. Radiographically suspected radiation necrosis (RN) after re-irradiation was seen in 6 patients (16.7%) whose median cumulative radiation doses were 100.4 Gy, and a median cumulative BED were 198.4 Gy (a/b=2 Gy). At 3, 7 and 8 months after re-irradiation, neurological deterioration occurred in 3 patients, and was managed with dexamethasone and anticonvulsant drug. Conclusion(s): Approximately 45 Gy of re-irradiation after 60 Gy of initial radiation therapy was feasible without serious complications. Re-irradiation could be suggested as an alternative salvage treatment for selected recurrent glioma patients with good performance status and recurrence over a longer period of time.",Excluded
2120,"Electrophysiological characterization of interlaminar entorhinal connections: an essential link for re-entrance in the hippocampal-entorhinal system The hippocampal formation communicates with the neocortex mainly through the adjacent entorhinal cortex. Neurons projecting to the hippocampal formation are found in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex and are largely segregated from the neurons receiving hippocampal output, which are located in deep entorhinal layers. We studied the communication between deep and superficial entorhinal layers in the anaesthetized rat using field potential recordings, current source density analysis and single unit measurements. We found that subiculum stimulation was able to excite entorhinal neurons in deep layers. This response was followed by current sinks in superficial layers. Both responses were subject to frequency dependent facilitation, but not depression. Selective blockade of deep layer responses also abolished subsequent superficial layer responses. This clearly demonstrates a functional deep-to-superficial layer communication in the entorhinal cortex, which can be triggered by hippocampal output. This pathway may provide a means by which processed hippocampal output is integrated or compared with new incoming information in superficial entorhinal layers, and it constitutes an important link in the process of re-entrance of activity in the hippocampal-entorhinal network, which may be important for consolidation of memories or retaining information for short periods.",Excluded

There is no consensus on the optimal management of these patients. The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of patients diagnosed with an incidental meningioma who were treated with surgery or radiotherapy. Method(s): Single-center retrospective cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with an incidental intracranial meningioma (2007-2015). Outcomes recorded were postintervention morbidity, histopathologic diagnosis, and treatment response. Result(s): Out of 441 patients, 44 underwent treatment. Median age at intervention was 56.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 49.6-66.5); patients included 35 women and 9 men. The main indication for imaging was headache (25.9%). Median meningioma volume was 4.55 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR, 1.91-8.61), and the commonest location was convexity (47.7%). Six patients underwent surgery at initial diagnosis. Thirty-eight had intervention (34 with surgery and 4 with radiotherapy) after a median active monitoring duration of 24 months (IQR, 11.8-42.0). Indications for treatment were radiologic progression (n = 26), symptom development (n = 6), and patient preference (n = 12). Pathology revealed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 meningioma in 36 patients and WHO grade 2 in 4 patients. The risk of postoperative surgical and medical morbidity requiring treatment was 25%. Early and late moderate adverse events limiting activities of daily living occurred in 28.6% of patients treated with radiotherapy. Recurrence rate after surgery was 2.5%. All meningiomas regressed or remained radiologically stable after radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): The morbidity after treatment of incidental intracranial meningioma is not negligible. Considering most operated tumors are WHO grade 1, treatment should be reserved for those manifesting symptoms or demonstrating substantial growth on radiologic surveillance.

1240,"ATM is upregulated during the mitogenic response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells Patients with the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) are characterized by immunodeficiency and a predisposition to develop lymphoid malignancies. The gene mutated in A-T patients, ATM, codes for a high molecular weight protein that is implicated in DNA damage recognition and cell cycle control. The ATM protein does not change in amount or cellular distribution throughout the cell cycle or in response to DNA damaging agents. Because peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are largely in a state of quiescence and can be readily stimulated to enter a proliferative phase and because A-T cells exhibit growth abnormalities and senescence, indicative of a general intracellular defect in signalling, we chose PBMCs to examine the relationship of ATM to the proliferative status of the cell. We show here that ATM protein is present at low levels in freshly isolated PBMCs and increases approximately 6-fold to 10-fold in response to a mitogenic stimulus, reaching a maximum after 3 to 4 days. A similar, but delayed response, was evident in the presence of serum only. This increase in ATM protein was accompanied by an increase in ATM kinase activity. While expression of ATM protein increased during proliferation, ATM mRNA expression was unchanged in stimulated and unstimulated cells and there was no evidence for increased ATM protein stability in the phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-treated cells. In keeping with the reduced levels of ATM in quiescent cells, the extent of radiation-induction of the p53 pathway was significantly lower than in mitogen-stimulated cells. Basal levels of p21 were elevated in quiescent cells, and the response to radiation was negligible or reduced compared with proliferating cells over a 2-hour period. Overall, the data suggest that the increase in ATM protein in proliferating cells is due to posttranscriptional regulation and points to a role for ATM in more general signalling.",Excluded

Switching on the neurostimulators caused a decrease in the N70/P100 amplitude of the VEP (P<0.01), which inversely correlated with the intensity of DBS (black-and-white pattern: P<0.01; color pattern: P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Despite artifacts generated by neurostimulators, the VEP and resting EEG were suitable for the detection of effects related to DBS STN. The acceleration of dominant frequency in the alpha band may be evidence of DBS STN influence on speeding up of intracortical oscillations. The spectral power decrease, seen mainly in the fronto-central region, might reflect a desynchronization in the premotor and motor circuits, though no movement was executed. Similarly, desynchronization of the cortical activity recorded posteriorly may by responsible for the VEP amplitude decrease implying DBS STN-related influence even on the visual system.SIGNIFICANCE: Changes in idling EEG activity observed diffusely over scalp together with involvement of the VEP suggest that the effects of DBS STN reach far beyond the motor system influencing the basic mechanisms of rhythmic cortical oscillations.",Excluded

Exposure to verapamil (0.1 to 10 microM) significantly increased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the electrically-evoked overflow of tritium, without affecting the spontaneous outflow of radioactivity. 2 Exposure to diltiazem in concentrations up to 100 microM had no effect on the electrically evoked release of [3H]-noradrenaline, but increased the basal outflow of radioactivity at 10 and 100 microM. 3 The preferential alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.1 microM) significantly antagonized the inhibitory effect of clonidine or adrenaline on [3H]-noradrenaline overflow elicited by electrical stimulation. Verapamil (3 microM) also antagonized this inhibitory effect of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists on [3H]-noradrenaline release. In contrast to these results, exposure to diltiazem (10 microM) was ineffective in blocking the action of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. 4 These results suggest that the two Ca2+-antagonists verapamil and diltiazem differ in their ability to affect central noradrenergic neurotransmission. While verapamil is a relatively potent alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, diltiazem is devoid of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist properties.",Excluded

Studies among Japanese physicians trained in cancer pain management demonstrated over 80% prescribe antiemetics, with neuroleptic antipsychotics (prochlorperazine 88%) as the most commonly prescribed drugs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the practice among Italian experts on supportive care in cancer of the prophylactic use of antiemetics when starting opioids prescription for OINV prevention. Material(s) and Method(s): From January to March 2017, we carried out a web-based cross sectional national survey. The survey was created with the GoogleDocsTM online surveys maker (https://docs.google.com). All invited participants received e-mail with the 12-items electronic questionnaire that was only accessible through a direct link. The questionnaire assessed the physicians' practice and beliefs regarding the prophylactic antiemetics prescription when they start opioids in patients with cancer pain (7 items) and other demographics data (5 items). According to the exploratory intent of the survey, we did not predefine any formal statistical hypothesis or sample size. Result(s): 112/256 responded to the electronic questionnaire (ORR 43.7%): 54 medical oncologists, 16 anesthesiologists, 11 radiation/clinical oncologists, 5 internists, 2 geriatrics, 1 infectivologist, 1 general surgeon. 22 physicians declared no formal medical specialization. Responders were geographically evenly distributed among Italian areas and came from palliative care units (61), community hospitals (21), education hospitals (20) and comprehensive cancer centers (10). 45% prescribed prophylactic antiemetics at the beginning of opioid prescription, and the most commonly prescribed drug for this purpose were prokinetics such as metoclopramide and domperidone (84%), followed by 5-HT3 antagonists (8%), neuroleptic antipsychotics (6%), corticosteroids (2%). Among physicians who prescribed prophylactic antiemetics, 41 (82%) also prescribed antiemetics (prokinetics as well) for use as treatment at the occurrence of OINV. Conclusion(s): Italian physicians do not commonly prescribe prophylactic antiemetics for OINV. Unlike previous reported evidences, dopamine antagonists resulted the most commonly prescribed drugs.

2245,"Novel egfr/DNA binary targeting molecule zrba1 potentiates radiation response in glioblastoma tumor model Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans with a poor clinical outcome. Although no contemporary therapies are completely curative combined chemo-radiation (STUPP) has led to improved overall survival. Therefore development of new targeted drugs and their combination with radiation offer new treatment possibilities. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the radiosensitizing abilities of ZRBA1combi-molecule designed to block bothEGFR-TKsignaling pathways while additionally inducing significant levels of DNA damage. In cancer cells the binary property ofZRBA1can be limited byDNArepair mechanismtherefore in order to increase its efficacy we combined this drug with ionizing radiation. The effect of ZRBA1 on the radiosensitivity of three human glioblastoma cell lines (U87, U343 and U373) was evaluated using MTT and clonogenic assays whereas DNA damage/repair and cell cycle were evaluated using gH2AX antibody and FACS assay. Our results demonstrate that exposure of cells to 25uM of ZRBA1 resulted in an increase in radiosensitivity of all tested cell lines with dose enhancement factors at a surviving fraction of 0.1 ranging from 1.4 to 1.7. Importantly, in contrast to Temozolomide which enhances radiation response most effectively in MGMT-negative cells, radiosensitizing proprieties of ZRBA1 does not depend on theMGMTmethylation status. Additionally, as a measure ofDNAdouble strand breaks, the number of gH2AXfoci per cell was significantly greater at 24h after the combined modality compared with the individual treatments with radiation, Temozolomide or ZRBA1 alone. Overall, our results have demonstrated of increased levels of DNA double strand breaks when ZRBA1 was combined with radiation and suggests that the radiosensitizing proprieties of ZRBA1 relay on inhibition of DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. Therefore we postulate that ZRBA1 may be developed as a potent and innovative radiosensitizing agent for malignant glioma tumors.",Excluded
1854,"Cerebellar Liponeurocytoma with an Unusually Aggressive Clinical Course: Case Report OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Liponeurocytomas are rare cerebellar neoplasms in adults, with benign histological features and a favorable clinical prognosis. Current clinical opinion is based on a total of less than 20 published cases and suggests that gross total resection and long-term follow-up monitoring, with possible additional surgery and radiotherapy for treatment of recurrent tumors, represent the best treatment approach for this relatively benign tumor type. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old Caucasian woman presented with worsening unsteady gait and headaches, suggesting increased intracranial pressure. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent subtotal resection of a cerebellar liponeurocytoma, followed by fractionated radiotherapy (total dose of 54 Gy). She experienced a local recurrence of the tumor 12 months later and underwent additional surgery for removal of the cerebellar mass. A second recurrent tumor was diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging scans 3 months later and was surgically resected. The tumor histological findings were consistently devoid of atypical features, apart from leptomeningeal invasion noted in the first surgical specimen. CONCLUSION(S): This unusual case demonstrated an atypical clinical course of a highly aggressive and radiation-resistant tumor, despite the consistent absence of aggressive histological features. Cerebellar liponeurocytomas may not be as benign as the current literature and typical low-grade cytological and histological features suggest.",Excluded

Method(s): A head phantom was used as a target object. Axial CT and threedimensional CT angiograms were obtained at various effective milliampere-second values (49-350 mAs) and tube potentials (80-140 kVp) with a 64-row detector CT scanner. Lens doses were measured using a planar silicon pin-photodiode system. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and streak artefacts on the axial CT angiograms were evaluated and the image quality of the three-dimensional CT angiograms was assessed using entropy analysis. Result(s): Lens doses increased with tube potential and effective milliampere-seconds. From the evaluation of SNR and streak artefacts on axial CT angiograms, we found that the image quality was improved by setting the tube potential at 100 kVp. However, there was little visual difference in the image quality for 100 kVp between 252 (effective value recommended by the manufacturer) and 350 mAs (maximum effective value). In the entropy analysis of the image quality of three-dimensional CT angiograms, the mutual information (information gain) per lens dose was largest at 80 kVp and 252 mAs. Conclusion(s): Our results suggested that the suitable tube potentials for axial CT and three-dimensional CT angiograms were 100 and 80 kVp, respectively, and the effective milliampere-second value recommended by the manufacturer was appropriate.

To explore the underlying physiology, the effect of static magnetic fields (SMFs) on the carotid baroreflex control of microcirculation was studied. Twenty-four hemodynamic monitorings were performed in rabbits sedated by pentobarbital infusion (5 mg/kg/h) during experiments that lasted 120 min. Mean femoral artery blood pressure, heart rate, and ear lobe skin microcirculatory blood flow, measured by microphotoelectric plethysmogram (MPPG), were simultaneously recorded before and after a 40 min exposure of the sinocarotid baroreceptors to Nd(2)-Fe(14)-B alloy magnets (n = 14) or sham magnets (n = 10, control series). The local SMF field was 350 mT, at the baroreceptors' site. Arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was estimated from heart rate/blood pressure response to intravenous bolus injections of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. A significant positive correlation was found between the SMF-induced increase in BRS (DeltaBRS = BRS(afterSMF) - BRS(priorSMF)) and the increment in microvascular blood flow (DeltaMPPG = MPPG(afterSMF) - MPPG(priorSMF)) (r = 0.66, p < 0.009). The SMF probably modulated the arterial baroreflex-mediated microcirculatory control. This could represent one possible mechanism how environmental magnetic fields act on the cardiovascular system, and a method how to complexly adjust macro- and microcirculation with potential clinical implementation.",Excluded

The optimal therapeutic approach for patients with AIDS-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (AR-PCNSL) remains undefined. While its incidence declined substantially with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), AR-PCNSL remains a highly aggressive neoplasm for which whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is considered a standard first-line intervention. Methods. To identify therapy-related factors associated with favorable survival, we first retrospectively analyzed outcomes of AR-PCNSL patients treated at San Francisco General Hospital, a public hospital with a long history of dedicated care for patients with HIV and AIDS-related malignancies. Results were validated in a retrospective, multicenter analysis that evaluated all newly diagnosed patients with AR-PCNSL treated with cART plus high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX). Results. We provide evidence that CD4+ reconstitution with cART administered during HD-MTX correlates with long-term survival among patients with CD4 <100. This was confirmed in a multicenter analysis which demonstrated that integration of cART regimens with HD-MTX was generally well tolerated and resulted in longer progression-free survival than other treatments. No profound differences in immunophenotype were identified in an analysis of AR-PCNSL tumors that arose in the pre-versus post-cART eras. However, we detected evidence for a demographic shift, as the proportion of minority patients with AR-PCNSL increased since advent of cART Conclusion. Long-term disease-free survival can be achieved in AR-PCNSL, even among those with histories of opportunistic infections, limited access to health care, and medical non-adherence. Given this, as well as the long-term toxicities of WBRT, we recommend that integration of cART plus first-line HD-MTX be considered for all patients with AR-PCNSL. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2016.

1355,"MDM2 overexpression is associated with short survival in adults with medulloblastoma In adult medulloblastoma, postoperative radiotherapy is significantly effective in prolonging time to recurrence and survival time; however, the response of individual cases to radiotherapy, that is the total survival, is different. Apoptosis is an important cellular response to radiation. It can be hypothesized that the individual radiosensitivity of medulloblastomas depends on the individual capability to undergo apoptosis. p53 protein is involved in the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation; loss of function of p53 can be the consequence not only of TP53 mutations, but also of amplification and/or overexpression of the MDM2 gene. We have analyzed cerebellar medulloblastomas from 51 adults (>16 years of age) for MDM2 gene amplification (by differential polymerase chain reaction assay), TP53 gene mutation (by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-8), and immunohistochemical expression of p53 (clone DO1) and MDM2 (clone IF2). The results have been evaluated in relation to age, tumor location, classic or desmoplastic type, MIB-1 labeling index, and total survival. No tumor had MDM2 amplification. Ten tumors had MDM2 positive tumor cells. One case had a mutated TP53 gene; 16/51 cases had intense p53 immunostaining. Only 2 MDM2 protein-positive tumors were also p53-positive. Both subgroups of MDM2 - and p53-positive tumors had a significantly shorter postoperative survival. In conclusion, the overexpression of MDM2 protein and the accumulation of wild-type p53 are unrelated in adult medulloblastoma; they may result in a reduced apoptotic response after radiotherapy and contribute to a shortened survival. Also, MDM2 amplification and TP53 gene mutation are rare events in medulloblastomas of adults.",Excluded

C-fos and junB, but not c-jun, mRNA was induced within 15 min in unanesthetized irradiated mice. Induction was transient and lasted < 4 h. The response was dose-dependent with increases in c-fos and junB mRNA levels after dose of > or = 2 and 7 Gy, respectively. Anesthesia of mice with pentobarbitol delayed the increases in mRNA expression and the response was attenuated. Pre-treatment of mice with dexamethasone, in a schedule which suppressed acute-phase gene expression after brain irradiation, did not significantly change c-fos and junB induction.

2015,"Simultaneous measurement of changes in light absorption due to the reduction of cytochrome c oxidase and light scattering in rat brains during loss of tissue viability We performed the simultaneous measurement of intrinsic optical signals (IOSs) related to metabolic activity and cellular and subcellular morphological characteristics, i.e., light scattering for a rat global ischemic brain model made by rapidly removing blood by saline infusion. The signals were measured on the basis of multiwavelength diffuse reflectances in which 605 and 830 nm were used to detect the IOSs that are thought to be dominantly affected by redox changes of heme aa(3) and CuA in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), respectively. For measuring the scattering signal, the wavelength that was found to be most insensitive to the absorption changes, e.g., approximately 620 nm, was used. The measurements suggested that an increase in the absorption due to reduction of heme aa(3) occurred soon after blood clearance, and this was followed by a large triphasic change in light scattering, during which time a decrease in the absorption due to reduction of CuA occurred. Through the triphasic scattering change, scattering signals increased by 5.2 +/- 1.5% (n = 5), and the increase in light scattering showed significant correlation with both the reflectance intensity changes at 605 and 830 nm. This suggests that morphological changes in cells correlate with reductions of heme aa(3) and CuA. Histological analysis of tissue after the triphasic scattering change showed no alteration in either the nuclei or the cytoskeleton, but electron microscopic observation revealed deformed, enlarged mitochondria and expanded dendrites. These findings suggest that the simultaneous measurement of absorption signals related to the redox changes in the CcO and the scattering signal is useful for monitoring tissue viability in the brain.",Excluded

1325,"Targeting glioma stem cells with Car-T immunotherapy in xenograft animal models Recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors often arise from glioma-initiating cells or glioma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are usually resistant to the standard therapeutic regiment of radiation and chemotherapy and hence have been an attractive target for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies to treating recurrent GBMs. Chimeric antigen receptor expressing engineered T (CAR-T) cells are redirected to detect and destroy rare tumor cells that express specific tumor antigens. CAR-T cells have been successful in treating hematological cancers, and moderately effective in remission of primary GBM tumors, but not yet been successful in the immunotherapeutic targeting of GSCs or recurrent GBMs. In this study, we have treated two patient-derived GSCs and tumor cell line derived neurospheres, as well as GSC/neurosphere-derived secondary tumor cells with CAR-T cells that specifically target IL13Ralpha2 tumor antigens on GBMs. These GSCs and neurospheres were resistant to radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy but were successful in activating antigen-specific CAR-T cells- as observed by increased proliferation as well as secretion of cytokines. In vitro co-culture of CAR-T cells with GSCs, neurospheres, and secondary tumors resulted in the effective cytotoxic killing of tumor cells. In experimental animals bearing xenograft implantation of GSCs or redefined secondary tumor cells, tumors went into remission when treated with CAR-T cells, in comparison to treatment with T cells that did not express specific CAR molecule. Together, we conclude that CAR-T cell immunotherapy can be an effective approach to targeting GSCs and treating secondary or recurrent GBM tumors.",Excluded

Anxiety (measured by State Anxiety Inventory) in the GI group changed from 31.7 +/- 5.9 to 26.8 +/- 2.6 and 27.8 +/- 4.1, whereas for the music group this changed from 32.2 +/- 7.6 to 31.2 +/- 8.3 and 26.8 +/- 6.8. During centrifuge training, the maximal HR for the GI group (101.2 +/- 8.8) was lower than that of the music group (123.0 +/- 19.1). In addition GI showed a decrease in low frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) components and an increase in high frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz) components before and after centrifuge training.CONCLUSION: GI was capable of decreasing tension, anxiety, and sympathetic nervous system activity pre- or post-centrifugation.",Excluded
1562,"Epworth Sleepiness Scale-a novel tool to assess somnolence syndrome post radiotherapy to brain Introduction: Radiation to brain causes early, early-delayed and delayed side effects.1 Although early and delayed effects are well studied, there is paucity of literature regarding early-delayed effects like somnolence syndrome. The existing studies use general symptom assessment and visual analog scales.2 Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a time tested tool to assess daytime sleepiness in various conditions.3 This study is an attempt to determine the presence of somnolence in our patients using this novel scale. It is a simple questionnaire and we expect this will be able to grade the severity of somnolence. This is the first study to our knowledge to determine post radiation somnolence using Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Objective(s): To study the incidence of somnolence syndrome in patients receiving radiotherapy to brain. Material(s) and Method(s): 23 patients with primary brain tumor or metastases to brain were the subjects of the study. Patient demographics and tumor type- primary or metastatic along with grade was noted. Patients with Karnofsky performance status less than 70 and those with pre-existing sleep disorders were excluded from the study. Patients were treated with palliative whole brain radiation for brain metastases and conformal adjuvant radiotherapy for primary brain tumors as per standard guidelines. Patients were subjected to Epworth Sleepiness Scale3 at baseline, thereafter every week during radiation; also continuing weekly after cessation of radiation until 6 weeks post treatment. Result(s): All 23 patients (median age 50 years) completed the planned questionnaires until 6 weeks post radiation. 20 had primary brain tumors whereas 3 had metastatic lesions in brain. Of the 23 patients, 14 patients (60.86%) had abnormal or increased daytime sleepiness; of which 3 had ESS scores greater than 16. Conclusion(s): Somnolence occurred in 60.86% of the patients who underwent radiation treatment for brain tumors, which is in accordance with existing literature.4,5 Epworth Sleepiness Scale is an effective tool to detect and quantify somnolence, however it does not consider other symptoms of somnolence syndrome and hence should be combined with visual analog scale to get complete information.",Excluded

1809,"Glioma-specific cytotoxic T cells can be effectively induced by subcutaneous vaccination of irradiated wild-type tumor cells without artificial cytokine production Effective induction of systemic antitumor immunity is a crucial step for success of immune gene therapy for intracerebral gliomas. We examined in this study the ability to induce glioma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) by subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization of irradiated whole-tumor cell vaccine with or without artificial cytokine production, and also examined in vivo efficacy of the induced CTL against a rat brain tumor model with 9L gliosarcoma cells. Murine neuroblastoma C1300 cells transduced with the interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene (C1300/IL-2, C1300/IL-4 or C1300/GM-CSF) were used as cytokine-producers. Glioma-specific CTL activity was equivalently induced in the rats vaccinated s.c. with irradiated 9L, irradiated IL-2-producing 9L cells or the mixed population of irradiated 9L and C1300/IL-2 cells, while the activity was relatively lower in the rats vaccinated with irradiated 9L cells mixed with either C1300/IL-4 or C1300/GM-CSF cells. In the rats immunized s.c. with irradiated 9L cells, intracerebral (i.c.) 9L tumors implanted together with either C1300/IL-2 or C1300/IL-4 were completely rejected. Pre-established brain tumor also could be eliminated by the s.c. immunization of irradiated 9L cells and i.c. transplantation of IL-2-producers. These results suggest that glioma-specific CTLs could be effectively induced by s.c. immunization of irradiated wild-type tumor cells without artificial cytokine production.",Excluded

Fifteen-day-old cultures were exposed to blue actinic light or to white fluorescent light for 24 hours. Cultures were treated by the addition of different concentrations of crocin for 24 hours before light exposure or for 8 hours after light exposure. Cultures kept in the dark were used as controls. Green nucleic acid stain assay was used to evaluate cell death. Rods and cones were immunolabeled with specific antibodies and counted. TUNEL labeling was used to detect fragmented DNA in fixed cells after light exposure.RESULTS: Primary retinal cell cultures contained a mixture of retinal cells enriched in photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and Muller cells. Twenty-four-hour exposure to blue and white light induced death in 70% to 80% of the photoreceptors in bovine and primate retinal cell cultures. Crocin protected the photoreceptors against blue light- or white light-mediated damage in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of approximately 30 microM. TUNEL assays confirmed that crocin protected photoreceptors from light damage.CONCLUSIONS: These results show that blue and white light selectively induce rod and cone cell death in an in vitro model. Crocin protects retinal photoreceptors against light-induced cell death.",Excluded
1356,"Mechanisms and Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation The US Air Force Office of Scientific Research convened a meeting of researchers in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, engineering, and medicine to discuss most pressing issues facing ongoing research in the field of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and related techniques. In this study, we present opinions prepared by participants of the meeting, focusing on the most promising areas of research, immediate and future goals for the field, and the potential for hormesis theory to inform tDCS research. Scientific, medical, and ethical considerations support the ongoing testing of tDCS in healthy and clinical populations, provided best protocols are used to maximize safety. Notwithstanding the need for ongoing research, promising applications include enhancing vigilance/attention in healthy volunteers, which can accelerate training and support learning. Commonly, tDCS is used as an adjunct to training/rehabilitation tasks with the goal of leftward shift in the learning/treatment effect curves. Although trials are encouraging, elucidating the basic mechanisms of tDCS will accelerate validation and adoption. To this end, biomarkers (eg, clinical neuroimaging and findings from animal models) can support hypotheses linking neurobiological mechanisms and behavioral effects. Dosage can be optimized using computational models of current flow and understanding dose-response. Both biomarkers and dosimetry should guide individualized interventions with the goal of reducing variability. Insights from other applied energy domains, including ionizing radiation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and low-level laser (light) therapy, can be prudently leveraged.",Excluded

1997,"Opsin co-expression in Limulus photoreceptors: differential regulation by light and a circadian clock A long-standing concept in vision science has held that a single photoreceptor expresses a single type of opsin, the protein component of visual pigment. However, the number of examples in the literature of photoreceptors from vertebrates and invertebrates that break this rule is increasing. Here, we describe a newly discovered Limulus opsin, Limulus opsin5, which is significantly different from previously characterized Limulus opsins, opsins1 and 2. We show that opsin5 is co-expressed with opsins1 and 2 in Limulus lateral and ventral eye photoreceptors and provide the first evidence that the expression of co-expressed opsins can be differentially regulated. We show that the relative levels of opsin5 and opsin1 and 2 in the rhabdom change with a diurnal rhythm and that their relative levels are also influenced by the animal's central circadian clock. An analysis of the sequence of opsin5 suggests it is sensitive to visible light (400-700 nm) but that its spectral properties may be different from that of opsins1 and 2. Changes in the relative levels of these opsins may underlie some of the dramatic day-night changes in Limulus photoreceptor function and may produce a diurnal change in their spectral sensitivity.",Excluded
2044,"Ondansetron and azithromycin: A common combination that can cause QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias Case Reports: Ondansetron is a commonly used antiemetic medication which received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 19911. On September 9, 2011 the FDA announced an ongoing safety review of ondansetron due to suspicion of increasing the risk of abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart2. The FDA received numerous reports of patients taking ondansetron with abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) changes including the potentially fatal cardiac rhythm torsade de pointes2. Ondansetron labeling was updated to warn against prescribing in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. GlaxoSmith Kline, the manufacturer of Zofran, will publish results in the summer of 2012 of an ongoing study investigating the likelihood of ondansetron prolonging the QT interval2. The FDA and manufacturer recommend monitoring electrocardiograms on patients at high risk of arrhythmias1, 2. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has fewer case reports of QT interval prolongation after administration3, 4. Other macrolide antibiotics have been associated with QT interval prolongation but the manufacturer currently does not recommend monitoring electrocardiograms in patients receiving azithromycin1. However in April 2012, a recent study concluded azithromycin had a marginal increase in deaths secondary to cardiovascular causes compared to no antibiotics and treatment with amoxicillin5. In this case, a young female with no known history of structural cardiac disease has a cardiac arrest after receiving multiple doses of ondansetron and azithromycin.A 20 year old female presented to an outside hospital with a one week history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was transferred to our hospital on 9/11/2011 with persistent nausea and elevated liver function tests. She reported resolution of vomiting and diarrhea but felt weak and lethargic and complained of mild bilateral knee pain with no recent trauma. She also complained of sore throat and mild left ear discomfort. Upon presentation on 9/11/2011, she had significant transaminitis with ALT of 2644 U/L, AST of 1647 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 191 U/L. The patient had a total protein of 4.7 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL, TSH of 20.797 uIU/mL, sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 5.8 mmol/L, chloride of 89 mmol/L, and bicarbonate of 19 mmol/L, creatinine of 17.1 mg/dL, and calcium of 6.3 mg/dL. Four milligrams of intravenous ondansetron was administered at an outside emergency room on 9/10/2011 at 22:50. Figure 1 shows rhythm strips prior to the patient experiencing cardiac arrest. She has an extensive past medical history which consists of metastatic thyroid cancer status post thyroidectomy and I-331 radiation, idiopathic end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, community acquired pneumonia, anemia, renal osteodystrophy, hypertension, parathyroidectomy and malnutrition. On 9/11/2011, the patient received four doses of intravenous ondansetron 4 mg at 01:37, 09:21, 15:06, and 23:16. On 9/12/2011, the transaminitis continued with ALT of 2587 U/L, AST of 2121 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 217 U/L, total protein of 4.2 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 6.3 mmol/L, chloride of 88 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, creatinine of 16.7 mg/dL, and calcium of 5.7 mg/dL. The first dose of intravenous azithromycin 500 milligrams was given at 13:28 for possible community acquired pneumonia. At 14:00, the patient had cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation after development of sudden-onset bradycardia and profound hypotension. Cardiac rhythms from this cardiac arrest are included in Figure 2. The patient received CPR, two doses of atropine, two doses of epinephrine, and one dose of calcium chloride with brief return of spontaneous pulses. Patient was intubated, dopamine infusion began, and ventricular fibrillation developed. She was shocked once and given sodium bicarbonate. The cardiac arrest lasted twenty-five minutes and she was transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient did not receive any other oses of ondansetron. Antibiotics were broadened to include: azithromycin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and linezolid. On 9/13/2011, transaminitis persisted with ALT of 1682 U/L, AST of 712 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 185 U/L, total protein of 3.5 g/dL, and total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL. Other abnormal labs included sodium of 131 mmol/L, potassium of 4.8 mmol/L, chloride of 90 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 23 mmol/L, creatinine of 16 mg/dL, and calcium of 6.4 mg/dL (ionized calcium 0.79). Azithromycin 500 milligrams was administered intravenously at 12:09. Within the next hour, the nurse noted the patient to have large and dilated pupils and increased decerebrate posturing. Bradycardia with ventricular tachycardia resulting in pulseless electrical activity was recorded at 13:14. Figure 3 depicts rhythms from this timeframe. The code began at 13:15 with dopamine infusion and boluses of atropine, epinephrine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. She went into ventricular fibrillation and was shocked. The patient had return of spontaneous circulation with sustained ventricular tachycardia after several minutes. Azithromycin was discontinued and electrolytes were corrected. An EKG was taken on 9/13/2011 at 19:09 which showed a corrected QT interval of 499 milliseconds. She did not receive any more doses of ondansetron or azithromycin throughout the admission. CT scan of the head was negative for any acute findings.After the two codes, the patient recovered from anoxic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, and shock liver. Electrolytes were corrected daily if needed to avoid repeat cardiac arrests. After correction of electrolytes and discontinuation of azithromycin, the patient's QT interval remained prolonged. It is noted later that she had a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram from a previous admission (3/9/2011) which showed a corrected QT interval of 538 milliseconds. She received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator during this admission. DiscussionA normal QT interval depends on the balance of sodium and potassium in the heart6. QT prolongation results if cardiac potassium channels are blocked while QRS widening results when sodium channels in the heart are blocked7, 8. HERG is the cardiac potassium channel responsible for the rapid repolarizing current (IKr)7. The QT interval is influenced by the rapid repolarizing current produced by HERG as well as the slow repolarizing current produced by a different cardiac potassium channel KvLQT1 7. Blockage of sodium channels lengthens depolarization and repolarization of the action potential9 which leads to lengthening of the QRS. Patients with prolonged corrected QT intervals greater than 450 milliseconds in men and 460 milliseconds in women are at increased risk of developing arrhythmias6. As the lengthening occurs, the risk of torsade de pointes and ventricular arrythmias increases6.Known risk factors for the lengthening of the QT interval include patients with underlying heart conditions include: 9, 10, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia10,6, concomitant QT-prolonging medications10, 9, bradycardia9, 10, and female gender9. Medications that increase the QT interval include: macrolides (erythromycin and clarithromycin), droperidol, selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, 5-HT antagonists, antipsychotics, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, tacrolimus, voriconazole10, and now more recently brought to the attention by the FDA are 5-HT3 antagonists.This female patient had several comorbidities including: 6, 9 chronic renal failure11, 12,13, hypothyroidism14 and electrolyte abnormalities6, 10, 9 that can lead to prolonged QT interval and ventricular arrythmias. Because of her young age and lack of cardiac history, her previous prolonged QT interval may have been over looked. In addition to her comorbidities, concomitant medications such as ondansetron and azithromycin, which prolong the QT interval, could have resulted in her cardiac arrest. For years droperidol was commonly used for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) but was found to cause significant QT interval prolongation15. Droperidol is believed to cause QT interval prolongation by blocking the HERG potassium (IK) channel9. Droperidol received a black box warning in 2001 for the potential of QT prolongation and induction of arrhythmias9. In order to avoid this risk of QT interval prolongation and other side effects of droperidol, 5-HT3 antagonists became first-line agents for prevention and treatment of PONV15. After increased usage of ondansetron and other 5-HT3 antagonists, more reports of increased QT prolongation have emerged2. Ondansetron has been shown to block sodium channels which widens the QRS and the cardiac HERG potassium (IK) channel which prolongs the QT interval9. The impact of QT prolongation by droperidol and ondansetron has been compared in a nonrandomized fashion. A study of 16 patients determined that both droperidol and ondansetron increase the QT interval alone and in combination with each other16. In a study of 85 patients with PONV, droperidol 0.75 mg intravenously and ondansetron 4 mg intravenously produced similar QT interval prolongation15. No patients received any other QT interval-prolonging medications. Forty-three patients received 0.75 milligrams of droperidol intravenously while forty-two patients received 4 milligrams of ondansetron intravenously when PONV was experienced. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at baseline and then 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after medication administration. Although the study was nonrandomized, the electrocardiograms were analyzed after completion of the study by one blinded investigator.",Excluded

2025,"Stereotactic irradiation of the postoperative resection cavity for brain metastasis: a frameless linear accelerator-based case series and review of the technique PURPOSE: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the standard of care after resection of a brain metastasis. However, concern regarding possible neurocognitive effects and the lack of survival benefit with this approach has led to the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity in place of WBRT. We report our initial experience using an image-guided linear accelerator-based frameless stereotactic system and review the technical issues in applying this technique.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the setup accuracy, treatment outcome, and patterns of failure of the first 18 consecutive cases treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The target volume was the resection cavity without a margin excluding the surgical track.RESULTS: The median number of brain metastases per patient was 1 (range, 1-3). The median planning target volume was 3.49 mL. The median prescribed dose was 18 Gy (range, 15-18 Gy) with normalization ranging from 68% to 85%. In all cases, 99% of the planning target volume was covered by the prescribed dose. The median conformity index was 1.6 (range, 1.41-1.92). The SRS was delivered with submillimeter accuracy. At a median follow-up of 12.7 months, local control was achieved in 16/18 cavities treated. True local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. No marginal failures occurred. Distant recurrence occurred in 6/17 patients. Median time to any failure was 7.4 months. No Grade 3 or higher toxicity was recorded. A long interval between initial cancer diagnosis and the development of brain metastasis was the only factor that trended toward a significant association with the absence of recurrence (local or distant) (log-rank p = 0.097).CONCLUSIONS: Frameless stereotactic irradiation of the resection cavity after surgery for a brain metastasis is a safe and accurate technique that offers durable local control and defers the use of WBRT in select patients. This technique should be tested in larger prospective studies.",Excluded
2112,"The effects of sequential versus concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy on survival and toxicity in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytoma PURPOSE: To determine the effects of sequential versus concurrent administration of cranial radiotherapy and cisplatin/carmustine (BCNU) chemotherapy on survival and toxicity in newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytomas.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1988 to 1996, 101 patients were treated on 2 therapeutic protocols for malignant glioma that used the identical chemotherapy regimen but differed in the timing of cranial radiotherapy. The eligibility criteria for the 2 protocols were identical. In the first protocol (1988-1991, 52 patients), cisplatin 120 mg/BCNU 120 mg i.v. over 72 h, was given for 3 monthly cycles prior to cranial radiotherapy. After a response rate of 42%, with a median survival of 13 months was achieved with this sequential regimen, a successor protocol (1992-1996, 49 patients) was developed in which cranial radiotherapy began concurrently with the start of the identical chemotherapy regimen. Chemotherapy was delayed but not discontinued if prolonged grade III/IV hematologic toxicity was experienced, but protocol therapy was discontinued if disease progression or thromboembolic events occurred. Survival outcome and hematologic toxicity were compared for the patients treated on these protocols.RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of sequentially-treated patients and 68% of concurrently-treated patients completed all planned therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival was similar to concurrent or sequential administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (median 12.8 months vs. 13.8 months, respectively). Hematologic toxicity was significantly less in sequentially- versus concurrently-treated patients, with median nadir per cycle (2.9 vs. 1.8 x 10(3)/mm3) (p < 0.001), and incidence of grade 3/4 leukopenia 40% versus 77% (p = 0.002). There was also an increase in platelet transfusion requirements in concurrently-treated patients, but no significant worsening of anemia. We postulate that the worsened leukopenia results from the effects of concurrent radiotherapy on circulating stem cells.CONCLUSION: Concurrent radiotherapy with this regimen of cisplatin and BCNU chemotherapy did not improve survival, but did increase hematologic toxicity. Therefore, we do not recommend further testing of the concurrent regimen, whereas the sequential regimen is currently under evaluation in a Phase III trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the Southwest Oncology Group. In addition, these studies demonstrate that relatively small radiotherapy fields can deliver a dose to circulating stem cells sufficient to worsen the hematologic toxicity of concurrent myelosuppressive chemotherapy, a phenomena which should be considered in the design of combined modality protocols for other body sites.",Excluded
2368,"Daytime colour preference in Drosophila depends on the circadian clock and TRP channels Light discrimination according to colour can confer survival advantages by guiding animals towards food and shelter and away from potentially harmful situations<sup>1,2</sup>. Such colour-dependent behaviour can be learned or innate. Data on innate colour preference in mammals remain controversial<sup>3</sup> and there are limited data for simpler organisms<sup>4-7</sup>. Here we show that, when given a choice among blue, green and dim light, fruit flies exhibit an unexpectedly complex pattern of colour preference that changes according to the time of day. Flies show a strong preference for green in the early morning and late afternoon, a reduced green preference at midday and a robust avoidance of blue throughout the day. Genetic manipulations reveal that the peaks in green preference require rhodopsin-based visual photoreceptors and are controlled by the circadian clock. The midday reduction in green preference in favour of dim light depends on the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels dTRPA1 and Pyrexia, and is also timed by the clock. By contrast, avoidance of blue light is primarily mediated by multidendritic neurons, requires rhodopsin 7 and the TRP channel Painless, and is independent of the clock. Our findings show that several TRP channels are involved in colour-driven behaviour in Drosophila, and reveal distinct pathways of innate colour preference that coordinate the behavioural dynamics of flies in ambient light.",Excluded

Few studies have been conducted to measure them accurately.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The objective of our study is to quantify, during a PPSF carried out in different experimented centers respecting current radiation protection recommendations, this irradiation at the level of the surgeon and the patient. We have prospectively included 100 FPVP procedures for which we have collected radiation doses from the main operator. For each procedure, the doses of whole-body radiation, lens and extremities were measured.RESULTS: Our results show a mean whole body, extremity and lens exposure dose per procedure reaching 1.7+/-2.8muSv, 204.7+/-260.9muSv and 30.5+/-25.9muSv, respectively. According to these values, the exposure of the surgeon's extremities and lens will exceed the annual limit allowed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) after 2440 and 4840 procedures respectively.CONCLUSION: Recent European guidelines will reduce the maximum annual exposure dose from 150 to 20mSv. The number of surgical procedures to not reach the eye threshold, according to our results, should not exceed 645 procedures per year. Pending the democratization of neuronavigation systems, the use of conventional fluoroscopy exposes the eyes in the first place.

2361,"Effect of gravity and microgravity on intracranial pressure KEY POINTS: Astronauts have recently been discovered to have impaired vision, with a presentation that resembles syndromes of elevated intracranial pressure on Earth. Gravity has a profound effect on fluid distribution and pressure within the human circulation. In contrast to prevailing theory, we observed that microgravity reduces central venous and intracranial pressure. This being said, intracranial pressure is not reduced to the levels observed in the 90 deg seated upright posture on Earth. Thus, over 24 h in zero gravity, pressure in the brain is slightly above that observed on Earth, which may explain remodelling of the eye in astronauts.ABSTRACT: Astronauts have recently been discovered to have impaired vision, with a presentation that resembles syndromes of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). This syndrome is considered the most mission-critical medical problem identified in the past decade of manned spaceflight. We recruited five men and three women who had an Ommaya reservoir inserted for the delivery of prophylactic CNS chemotherapy, but were free of their malignant disease for at least 1 year. ICP was assessed by placing a fluid-filled 25 gauge butterfly needle into the Ommaya reservoir. Subjects were studied in the upright and supine position, during acute zero gravity (parabolic flight) and prolonged simulated microgravity (6 deg head-down tilt bedrest). ICP was lower when seated in the 90 deg upright posture compared to lying supine (seated, 4 +/- 1 vs. supine, 15 +/- 2 mmHg). Whilst lying in the supine posture, central venous pressure (supine, 7 +/- 3 vs. microgravity, 4 +/- 2 mmHg) and ICP (supine, 17 +/- 2 vs. microgravity, 13 +/- 2 mmHg) were reduced in acute zero gravity, although not to the levels observed in the 90 deg seated upright posture on Earth. Prolonged periods of simulated microgravity did not cause progressive elevations in ICP (supine, 15 +/- 2 vs. 24 h head-down tilt, 15 +/- 4 mmHg). Complete removal of gravity does not pathologically elevate ICP but does prevent the normal lowering of ICP when upright. These findings suggest the human brain is protected by the daily circadian cycles in regional ICPs, without which pathology may occur.",Excluded
1278,"Radiosurgery in the treatment of brain cavernomas. Experience with 17 lesions treated in 15 patients. [French] The aim of this study is to assess the efficiency of radiosurgery (RS) in the treatment of brain cavernomas. The series included intra-axial 17 lesions in 15 patients, 10 women and 5 men. Eleven were infratentorial lesions (brain stem and cerebellum) and 6 supratentorial (thalamus, hippocampus, brain cortex and paraventricular region). Fifteen lesions bled once or twice. Two lesions revealed by focal epilepsy displayed a rim of hemosiderin on MRI. RS was performed for all 17 lesions. The risk of morbidity was considered too high for surgery in 13 patients and 2 patients wished to be treated by RS. RS was delivered by a 6 MeV linear accelerator with a conic collimators device. Stereotactic localization and dosimetry were carried out with STP system 3.O (Fischer-Liebinger TM, Germany). Doses ranged between 16 and 23 Gy, the lower doses being delivered to brain stem lesions. All the lesions received a single fraction isocentric radiation. Lesion volumes ranged between 0.7 and 4.7 cm<sup>3</sup>. Twelve lesions disappeared on MRI, the volume reduced (50-80%) in 3 lesions, and did not change in 2 lesions. Volume reduction was significant (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). In the follow up, 4 patients experienced bleeding, 1 of them died. Edema diagnosed in 2 patients at 3 and 13 months was treated by corticosteroids. The risk of hemorrhage without treatment in this group of patients was estimated about 34.45% a year. Hemorrhage incidence observed after RS was 7.17% (significant with P < 0.01, P < 0.001). At the end of follow up, 12 patients were symptom-free, 2 had sequels from bleeding, 1 patient died. Radiosurgery is an efficient treatment of cavernomas leading to a total disappearance of 70% of the lesions and significantly reducing the risk of new hemorrhages. Â© 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

2039,"PAK4 governs radiation-induced endothelial GRO-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling and angiogenesis in glioma Aberrant neovascularization is a pathological hallmark of glioblastoma that correlates with poor clinical outcome. Factors that drive endothelial proliferation, recruitment into the tumor and angiogenesis in the context of radiotherapy are potentially novel therapeutic targets for glioma. Our studies showed high expression of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in gliomas; analyses of conditioned medium (CM) prepared from shRNA-mediated PAK4-knockdown (PAK4.sh) glioma cells using a human angiogenesis array showed a significant downregulation in key angiogenic factors including Gro-1alpha. Treatment of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) with CM from PAK4.sh-cells significantly inhibited endothelial proliferation, migration and microtubule formation compared with controls. PAK4.sh-CM treatment also suppressed CXCR2 receptor activation and decreased the expression levels of p-Stat3, MMP-2 and cyclin D1 in HBMECs. Ionizing radiation (IR, 8 Gy) activated Gro-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling in HBMECs, and induced high levels of endothelial capillary network formation on matrigel. On the other hand, PAK4.sh inhibited IR-induced angiogenesis by decreasing Gro-1alpha and CXCR2 levels in HBMECS. Further, in vivo experiments with orthotopic intracranial tumors in nude mice showed growth suppression in PAK4.sh tumors compared to control tumors. Immunohistochemical analyses of brain tumor sections showed a significant decrease in MMP-2 in PAK4.sh tumors. In summary, our studies emphasize a novel role of PAK4 as a critical mediator of tumor-endothelial cell interactions via Gro-1alpha-CXCR2signaling, and in vivo tumor growth suppression by PAK4 depletion indicates its therapeutic potential in the treatment of glioma.",Included
1605,"MR of brain radiation injury: Experimental studies in cats Two of six cats receiving small-field, single-dose, brain irradiation of 35 Gy with 6 MeV photons developed brain abnormalities in the irradiated area on MR images at 6 and 8 months, respectively, after treatment. The lesions were of high intensity on T2-weighted images and did not enhance after IV administration of gadolinium-DTPA. An additional lesion in one of these cats displayed high signal on T2-weighted images and enhanced on T1-weighted images after IV gadolinium-DTPA. Pathologic correlation revealed that the nonenhancing T2-weighted lesions consisted of edema or demyelinated regions without inflammation while the gadolinium-enhanced lesion demonstrated necrosis with inflammatory infiltrate. Focal brain irradiation may produce noninflammatory demyelination and necrosis. These histologic entities may be potentially distinguished on MR with IV gadolinium-DTPA.",Included

1703,"Mind over (white)matter: A relationship between client change talk and whitematter integrity? Diusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a method of applying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the assessment of whitemattermicrostructure. DTI is used tomeasure the directional coherence of water molecules (fractional anisotropy: FA) in white matter fiber bundles in the brain. High FA generally indicates greater axonal diameter, axonal density, & myelination. Fiber bundles including the arcuate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, have been linked to language functions (Frederici & Giheran, in press). Given the theorized role of client language in motivational interviewing (Moyers et al., 2009), and the evidence for dierences in brain activity between types of client change language (Houck et al., in press), the goal of the present study was to examine the correlation between FA and measures of client language from MI treatment sessions for alcohol use. DTI was available from9 subjects (M age = 42.4, SD = 13.5 years). Although change talk counts are linked to treatment outcomes, in the present sample these counts were also correlated with age, which has a strong independent relationship with FA. Instead we evaluated a transition probability extracted from sequential coding of MI sessions: the log-transformed odds ratio for the transition between therapist open questions and client change talk (OQ2CT).With both age and OQ2CT in the model, we observed a trend in right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (p = .24) and anterior thalamic radiation (p = .196), as well as an eect in the left cerebellum (p = .05), each indicating a negative relationship between FA and the odds of responding to an open question with change talk. Work with alcohol dependent individuals shows decreased FA in superior cingulum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Pfeferbaum et al., 2009). More recent research comparing current and remitted AUD suggests that these abnormalities are linked to recent drinking (Monnig et al., 2012). It is unlikely that within-session client speech has an immediate and direct eect upon whitematter integrity. Given the negative correlation in these data, amore plausible explanation is that participants with more severe drinking, and concomitantly greater damage to whitematter, aremore likely to describe negative consequences when asked about their drinking. Research with a larger sample and follow-up assessment is necessary before stronger conclusions can be drawn.",Excluded

1856,"Re-irradiation of adenoid cystic carcinoma: analysis and evaluation of outcome in 52 consecutive patients treated with raster-scanned carbon ion therapy BACKGROUND: Treatment of local relapse in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) following prior radiation remains a challenge: without the possibility of surgical salvage patients face the choice between palliative chemotherapy and re-irradiation. Chemotherapy yields response rates around 30% and application of tumouricidal doses is difficult due to proximity of critical structures. Carbon ion therapy (C12) is a promising method to minimize side-effects and maximize re-treatment dose in this indication. We describe our initial results for re-irradiation in heavily pre-treated ACC patients.METHODS: Patients treated with carbon ion therapy between 04/2010 and 05/2013 (N=52pts, median age: 54 a) were retrospectively evaluated regarding toxicity (NCI CTC v.4), tumour response (RECIST) and control rates. 48pts (92.3%) received carbon ions only, 4pts received IMRT plus C12.RESULTS: 4pts were treated following R1-resection, 43pts for inoperable local relapse. Most common tumour sites were paranasal sinus (36.5%), parotid (19.2%), and base of skull (17.3%). Pts received a median dose of 51GyE C12/63Gy BED and cumulative dose of 128Gy BED [67-182Gy] after a median RT-interval of 61months. Median target volume was 93ml [9-618ml]. No higher-grade (>degreeII) acute reactions were observed, 7pts showed blood-brain-barrier changes (degreeI/II: 8pts; degreeIII: 2pts), 1 pt corneal ulceration, xerophthalmia 7pts, degreeIV bleeding 1 pt, tissue necrosis 2pts, otherwise no significant late reactions. Objective response rate (CR/PR) was 56.6%. With a median follow-up of 14months [1-39months] local control and distant control at 1a are 70.3% and 72.6% respectively. Of the 18pts with local relapse, 13pts have recurred in-field, 1 pt at the field edge, 3pts out of field, and one in the dose gradient.CONCLUSION: Despite high applied doses, C12 re-irradiation shows moderate side-effects, response rates even in these heavily pre-treated patients are encouraging and present a good alternative to palliative chemotherapy. Though most local recurrences occur within the high-dose area, further dose escalation should be viewed with caution.",Excluded
1806,"GBM And Radiation: The Double-Edged Sword Effects Of Cannabis Purpose/Objective(s): Recent preclinical studies show that cannabidiol (CBD) at clinically relevant doses of 5-20 uM protects normal neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC) and fetal astrocytes from ionizing radiation while directly killing GBM cells. The precise mechanisms for these double-edged sword effects of CBD are unknown. The overall hypothesis of the present study is that CBD, by targeting the numerous signaling pathways (including those that are highly active in GBM), induces an imbalance between cell killing and cell survival mechanisms in cancer cells while demonstrating protective effects on the survival of normal neuronal cells. Materials/Methods: Human GBM cell lines (U87MG, T98G and TS543) and NSC were used as regular 2D or 3D spheroid/neurosphere cultures. Levels of autophagy were examined using LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and confirmed by immunofluorescence staining levels of SQSTM1/p62. Chloroquine (10-50 uM) was used as an inhibitor of autophagic flux. Apoptosis and necrosis were determined using Annexin-V-FITC plus Propidium Iodide staining. Levels of signaling proteins (active versus total) were detected using Western blot analysis and corresponding antibodies. Data were analyzed using the Standard t-test. Result(s): Blockage of autophagy in CBD-treated 3D tumor cultures upregulated radiation-induced cell death only modestly. CBD enhanced the pro-apoptotic activities of JNK1/2 and MAPK p38 signaling cascades by more than 3-fold while partially downregulated the pro-survival PI3K-AKT cascade, thereby enhancing the efficacy of radiation treatment of tumor cells. Co-treatment of CBD-targeted cells with inhibitors of pro-survival and inflammatory pathways effectively killed surviving GBM cells in both 2D and 3D cultures. In contrast, CBD, even at high doses (20 mM), did not induce apoptosis in NSC, but promoted their differentiation into young neurons and glial cells. Conclusion(s): Cannabidiol has both a strong apoptotic and a modest autophagic signaling pathway as shown in several GBM models. Studies to elucidate how these two contrasting pathways may be safely and optimally modulated in CBD treatment of GBM (using 3D cultures and mini-tumor models) are ongoing.

Among sham-exposed animals injected with 2 to 10 viable cells (group 1), the median survival was 70 days, with 27% of the anima sis surviving at 150 days. The median survival length and final survival fraction for animals injected with 11 to 36 viable cells (group 2) were 52 days and 14%, respectively, while the values for those injected with 37 to 100 cells (group 3) were 45 days and 0%.

1986,"Combining pedicle screw stimulation with spinal navigation, a protocol to maximize the safety of neural elements and minimize radiation exposure in thoracolumbar spine instrumentation Purpose: The O-arm-based navigation increases the accuracy of pedicle screw positioning and offers the possibility of performing a 3D scan before wound closure. However, repeating the 3D scan exposes the patient to additional radiation. We combined O-arm navigation with pedicle screw (PS) stimulation followed by a 3D scan to evaluate their accuracy and aimed for the creation of a protocol that maximizes the safety and minimizes radiation. Method(s): Patients had pedicle screws insertion using O-arm spinal navigation, then had PS triggered electromyography (EMG), and finally a 3D scan to evaluate the accuracy of screw position. Result(s): 447 screws were inserted in 71 patients. In 10 patients, 11 screws needed repositioning. Comparing results of PS triggered EMG responses to the 3D scan, we found: (a) negative stimulation response with negative 3D scan findings, corresponding to 432 acceptable screw position (96.6 %) in 58 patients (81.7 %). In these cases, the redo 3D scan could be avoided. (b) Positive stimulation response with positive 3D scan findings, corresponding to 7 unacceptable screw position (1.5 %) in 6 patients (8.4 %). In these cases, PS stimulation detected malpositioned screws that would be missed without a redo 3D scan. Conclusion(s): We propose a protocol of routinely performing PS stimulation after screw insertion using spinal navigation. In case of positive stimulation, a 3D scan must be performed to rule out a probable screw mal position (6 patients 8.4 %). However, in case of negative stimulation, redo 3D scan can be avoided in 81.7 % of patients. Copyright Â© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1537,"Medicinal plants as antiemetics in the treatment of cancer: a review Chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are the most common, intractable and unpleasant side effects in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists plus dexamethasone have significantly improved the control of acute nausea and vomiting, but delayed nausea and vomiting remains a significant clinical problem. Combined neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists with 5-HT3 antagonists and steroids are observed to be better in the control of both acute and delayed emesis. However, the use of these antiemetics is observed to possess inherent side effects. The medicinal plants such as Scutellaria baicalensis, Korean red ginseng, American ginseng berry, Ganoderma lucidum, Zingiber officinale, grape seed extract, and the oil of Mentha spicata are reported to be effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting mostly in preclinical studies. Of these, ginger has also been evaluated for its efficacy in humans and the results have been contradictory. The current review for the first time summarizes the results related to these properties. An attempt is also made to address the lacunae in these published studies and to emphasize aspects that need further investigations for these plants to be of use in clinics in the future.",Excluded
2365,"Diabetic levels of glucose increase cellular reducing equivalents but reduce survival in three models of 661W photoreceptor-like cell injury BACKGROUND: The effect of excess glucose on retinal cellular health remains controversial, and cellular reducing equivalents, as indicators of cellular energy production, are widely used as substitute indicators of retinal cellular health. These investigations hypothesised that excess energy substrate availability, as occurs in the diabetic retina, increases the susceptibility of retinal neurons to injury in the presence of increased cellular reducing equivalents.METHODS: The response of 661W cells to phototoxicity, oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and apoptosis induction by staurosporine was characterised in the presence of 5mM glucose and B27 defined media without insulin. Cellular insult was produced by phototoxicity, H2O2 and the apoptosis induction agent staurosporine. The effect of physiologically relevant alterations in environmental glucose on cellular reducing equivalents was assessed by MTT dye reduction and NAD(P)H assays, and cell survival was assessed via caspase 3/7 activation and Annexin V/PI flow cytometry.RESULTS: 661W photoreceptor-like cells underwent dose dependent cell death primarily by apoptosis in response to phototoxic insult, H2O2, and staurosporine by all measures of cellular viability. Exposure of cells to 25mM glucose (diabetic-type conditions) increased cell death in response to all insults as measured by caspase 3/7 activation and Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Cellular reducing equivalents were nonetheless increased in all models of injury in the presence of excess glucose. The mechanism of this increase was partly due to increased NADPH but not NADH levels in the presence of 25mM glucose.CONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to 25mM glucose decreased the resilience of 661W photoreceptor-like cells to a range of cellular stressors whilst maintaining or increasing cellular reducing equivalents, partly be increasing NADPH levels. This shows that in 661W cells, diabetic levels of glucose decrease cellular resilience to injury. The decoupling of cellular reducing equivalents levels from cell survival has important implications when investigating the mechanisms of neuronal damage in diabetic retinal neuropathy.",Excluded
1989,"Randomized trial of standard pain control with or without gabapentin for pain related to radiation-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer OBJECTIVE: Radiation-induced mucositis (RIM) in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for head and neck cancer (HNC) causes severe pain and worsens CRT compliance, QOL and outcome. Following retrospective reports, we conducted a randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of gabapentin for RIM-associated pain during CRT.METHODS: HNC patients (pts) receiving CRT were randomized to standard pain control (SPC) with acetaminophen and opioids, or SPC plus gabapentin (SPC+G). Gabapentin was maintained at 900mg/day for 4 weeks after CRT. Primary endpoint was maximum visual analogue scale (VAS) score during CRT, and secondary endpoints were total opioid dose, changes in QOL (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HN 35) from baseline to 4 weeks after CRT, and adverse events.RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible Stage III or IV pts were randomly assigned to SPC or SPC+G (n=11 each). Twelve were treated in a locally advanced setting and 10 in a postoperative setting. Median maximum VAS scores, median total dose of opioids at maximum VAS and total dose of opioids at 4 weeks after CRT tended to be higher in the SPC+G arm (47 in SPC vs. 74 in SPC+G, p=0.517; 215mg vs. 745.3mg, p=0.880; and 1260mg vs. 1537.5mg, p=0.9438, respectively), without significance. QOL analysis showed significantly worse scores in the SPC+G arm for weight gain (p=0.005). Adverse events related to gabapentin were manageable.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study is the first prospective randomized trial of gabapentin for RIM-related pain. Gabapentin had no apparent beneficial effect. Further research into agents for RIM-related pain is warranted.",Excluded

2342,"Gamma knife treatment for symptomatic epilepsy due to vascular malformations Introduction: Detailed prospective studies are scarce on gamma knife treatment for arteriovenous malformations (AVM) or cavernous angioma (CA) regarding epilepsy outcome. The objective of this study is to further investigate prospectively the effect of gamma knife on seizures and expand our knowledge to other aspects of epilepsy management: medication, cognition and quality of life. Method(s): We included prospectively 9 consecutive patients (4 AVM and 5 CA) who underwent radiosurgery for epilepsy caused by vascular malformation at the CHUS between August 2004 and August 2009. The mean marginal radiation dose was 20 Gy. The objective of this study is to determinate the seizure outcome after radiosurgery. Patients were followed every 3 months to evaluate seizure count over time, Engel score and medication status. Quality of life (QOLIE 89) and neuropsychological evaluation were completed before the treatment and at 12 and 24 months following the intervention. Result(s): Patients were followed for a mean period of 39 months (range from 15 to 72 months). Three patients have been seizure free for 1 year (33%). Overall 5 patients (55%) had significant improvement with an Engel score of 1 (completely seizure free or non disabling simple partial seizure only). Medication status did not change over time. The QOLIE 89 score improved by more than 25 points (on a 100 points scale) in 3 patients (43%), 2 patients (29%) reported no change and 2 patients had lower scores. Neuropsychological testing did not show any deterioration in cognition following the intervention. No adverse reaction occurred so far. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery has some efficacy for the treatment of epilepsy associated with vascular malformations and improves quality of life in a majority of patients. It seems less effective than surgical lesionectomy. No cognitive or physical morbidity was observed. This treatment could be a useful alternative for vascular lesions in eloquent areas that cannot be safely removed with microsurgery.",Excluded
1210,"New approaches in primary central nervous system lymphoma Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has long been associated with an inferior prognosis compared to other aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). However, during the past 10 years an accumulation of clinical experience has demonstrated that long-term progression-free survival (PFS) can be attained in a major proportion of PCNSL patients who receive dose-intensive consolidation chemotherapy and avoid whole brain radiotherapy. One recent approach that has reproducibly demonstrated efficacy for newly diagnosed PCNSL patients is an immunochemotherapy combination regimen used during induction that consists of methotrexate, temozolomide, and rituximab followed by consolidative infusional etoposide plus high-dose cytarabine (EA), administered in first complete remission (CR). Other high-dose chemotherapy-based consolidative regimens have shown efficacy as well. Our goal in this review is to update principles of diagnosis and management as well as data regarding the molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL, information that may constitute a basis for development of more effective therapies required to make additional advances in this phenotype of aggressive NHL.",Excluded
1740,"Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of the region of the sella turcica Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging is a versatile technique which has proved more sensitive in the detection of perisellar lesions than CT. A multiplanar facility, the demonstration of blood flow, and the lack of bone artefacts are its main advantages in this respect. Limitations are seen in its inability to identify small calcifications and to distinguish clearly perifocal oedema and tumour especially in malignant lesions. Relatively thick slices of 5-10 mm make the detection of microadenomas very difficult, mainly because of partial volume effects. T1 and T2 values alone are not sufficient to provide specific diagnosis. No reliable criteria have been determined yet, which would indicate the quality of pathological involvement of peritumorous structures by tumours of the sella region. At present NMR still plays a more complementary role to CT in the evaluation of this complex anatomical area. We are confident that with future technical refinements NMR will be able to replace ionizing radiation for the diagnostic imaging of the sella.",Excluded
1552,"The excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist MK-801 prevents the hypersensitivity induced by spinal cord ischemia in the rat Protection by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 against transient spinal cord ischemia-induced hypersensitivity was studied in rats. The spinal ischemia was initiated by vascular occlusion resulting from the interaction between the photosensitizing dye Erythrosin B and an argon laser beam. The hypersensitivity, termed allodynia, where the animals reacted by vocalization to nonnoxious mechanical stimuli in the flank area, was consistently observed during several days after induction of the ischemia. Pretreatment with MK-801 (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, iv) 10 min before laser irradiation dose dependently prevented the occurrence of allodynia. The neuroprotective effect of MK-801 was not reduced by maintaining normal body temperature during and after irradiation. There was a significant negative correlation between the delay in the administration of MK-801 after irradiation and the protective effect of the drug. Histological examination revealed slight morphological damage in the spinal cord in 38% of control rats after 1 min of laser irradiation without pretreatment with MK-801. No morphological abnormalities were observed in rats after pretreatment with MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg).

1713,"Progressive and reproducible focal cortical ischemia with or without late spontaneous reperfusion generated by a ring-shaped, laser-driven photothrombotic lesion in rats Clinical stroke is mostly of thromboembolic origin, in which the magnitude of brain damage resulting from arterial occlusions depends on the degree and duration of the concomitant ischemia. To facilitate more controllable and reproducible study of stroke-related pathophysiological mechanisms, a photothrombotic ring stroke model was initially developed in adult rats. The ring interior zone comprises an anatomically well confined cortical region-at-risk which is gradually encroached by progressive hypoperfusion, thus mimicking the situation (albeit in inverse fashion) of an ischemic penumbra or stroke-in-evolution. Modification of this model using a thinner ring irradiation beam resulted in late spontaneous reperfusion in the cortical region-at-risk and a remarkable morphological tissue recovery in this ostensibly critically injured region. On the other hand, doubling the thin irradiating beam intensity facilitates a complementary situation in which lack of reperfusion in the region-at-risk after stroke induction leads to tissue pannecrosis. The dual photothrombotic ring stroke model, effectuated either with or without reperfusion and thereby tissue recovery or pannecrosis, may be well suited for the study of events related to postischemic survival or cell death in the penumbra region. To popularize the photothrombotic ring stroke model, we present a detailed protocol of how this model is induced in either version as well as protocols for transcardial carbon black perfusion and laser-Doppler flowmetry experiments.

The paper presents the results of ultrasonic investigations of the heart, arterial and venous peripheral vessels in different parts of human body, and measurements of leg veins capacity with the use of occlusive plethysmograpy. It was shown that in the resting condition such prime hemodynamic parameters as the pumping function of the heart and blood supply of the brain, and integral parameters, i.e. arterial pressure and heat rate, were best ""protected"" as they demonstrated stability throughout long exposure in microgravity. In the absence of gravitational stimulation, arterial resistance went down in essentially all vascular regions below the heart level; to put it differently, the anti-gravity distribution of the vascular tone was annulled gradually as unneeded in microgravity. Compared with the data about arteries, venous hemodynamics was found to be particularly sensitive considering the early advent and significance of changes. Venous return slowed down, resistance of the lower body vessels declined and capacity of the leg venous net increased. Functional testing with the lower body negative pressure revealed degradation of the gravity-dependent reactions that became more conspicuous as flight duration extended further. Cardiovascular deconditioning showed itself clearly on return to Earth's gravity by decreased g-tolerance during re-entry and orthostatic instability post flight. These investigations provided objective evidence for multifactorial genesis of orthostatic instability during space flight including blood redistribution, altered tone regulation of leg's venous and arterial vessels and hypovolemia.",Excluded
1329,"Radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal melanoma metastases BACKGROUND: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating metastatic melanoma involving the spine has previously been limited. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously to limit the dose delivered to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of melanoma spinal metastases in 28 patients.METHODS: Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases were treated with a single-session radiosurgery technique (1 cervical, 11 thoracic, 13 lumbar, and 11 sacral) with a follow-up period of 3-43 months (median 13 months). Tumor volume ranged from 4.1 to 153 cm3 (mean 47.6 cm3). Twenty-three of the 36 lesions had received prior external beam irradiation.RESULTS: Maximum tumor dose was maintained at 17.5-25 Gy (mean 21.7 Gy). Spinal cord volume receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 cm3 (mean 0.26 cm3); spinal canal volume at the cauda equina level receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 cm3 (mean 0.98 cm3). No radiation-induced toxicity occurred during the follow-up period. Axial and radicular pain improved in 27 of 28 patients (96%) who were treated primarily for pain. Long-term tumor control was seen in 3 of 4 cases treated primarily for radiographic tumor progression. Two patients went on to require open surgical intervention for tumor progression resulting in neurological deficit.CONCLUSIONS: Spinal radiosurgery offers a therapeutic modality for the safe delivery of large dose fractions of radiation therapy in a single fraction for the management of spinal metastases in patients with advanced melanoma that are often poorly controlled with alternative conventional external beam radiation therapy, and is successful even in patients with previously irradiated lesions.",Excluded

However, neither the normal function of ATM in the nervous system nor the biological basis of the degeneration in AT is known. Resistance to apoptosis in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Atm-/- mice was observed after ionizing radiation. This lack of death occurred in diverse regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, which is markedly affected in AT. In wild-type, but not Atm-/- mice, up-regulation of p53 coincided with cell death, suggesting that Atm-dependent apoptosis in the CNS is mediated by p53. Further, p53 null mice showed a similar lack of radiation-induced cell death in the developing nervous system.

In whole brain, turnover of ACh was decreased after OT independently of the way of killing, but in striatum a decrease was observed only if microwave irradiation was used, which is in contrast to previous findings.

The paper covers cardiovascular and exercise physiology, barophysiology and decompression sickness, renal stone risk, immunology, neurovestibular and sensorimotor function, nutrition, pharmacotherapeutics, and reproduction. Potential health and functional impacts associated with the various physiological changes during spaceflight are discussed, and areas needing additional research are highlighted. Historically, studies of physiological responses to microgravity have not been aimed at examining gender-specific differences in the astronaut population. Insufficient data exist in most of the discipline areas at this time to draw valid conclusions about genderspecific differences in astronauts, in part due to the small ratio of women to men. The only astronaut health issue for which a large enough data set exists to allow valid conclusions to be drawn about gender differences is orthostatic intolerance following shuttle missions, in which women have a significantly higher incidence of presyncope during stand tests than do men. The most common observation across disciplines is that individual differences in physiological responses within genders are usually as large as, or larger than, differences between genders.

The results are given in the percent of Fe dose in 1 g of wet tissue. The statistical analysis (Students' t test) was performed. The results indicate that in poisoned animals the Fe distribution was different than in controls. Increased concentration of 59Fe was noted after 3 and 6 hours in stomach and after 1 day in large intestine, whereas in other organs the Fe concentration was lower, correlating usually with the Hg dose. One interesting thing was noted: the Fe concentration in almost all organs was higher in rats intoxicated with the 12 mg/kg dose of HgCl2 and given afterwards BAL (IV group), than in rats that were not given BAL.

We retrospectively identified 6 patients who underwent SRS twice for the same tumor. The median patient age was 47 years (range, 35-71 years). All patients had imaging evidence of tumor progression despite initial SRS. One patient also had incomplete surgical resection after initial SRS. All patients were deaf at the time of the second SRS. The median radiosurgery target volume at the time of the initial SRS was 0.5 cc and was 2.1 cc at the time of the second SRS. The median margin dose at the time of the initial SRS was 13 Gy and was 11 Gy at the time of the second SRS. The median interval between initial SRS and repeat SRS was 63 months (range, 25-169 months).RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 29 months after the second SRS (range, 13-71 months), tumor control or regression was achieved in all 6 patients. No patient developed symptomatic adverse radiation effects or new neurological symptoms after the second SRS.CONCLUSIONS: With this limited experience, we found that repeat SRS for a persistently enlarging acoustic neuroma can be performed safely and effectively.",Excluded
1612,"Increased seroreactivity to glioma-expressed antigen 2 in brain tumor patients under radiation BACKGROUND: Surgery and radiation are the mainstays of therapy for human gliomas that are the most common primary brain tumors. Most recently, cell culture and animal studies provided the first convincing evidence that radiation not only eliminates tumor cells, but also modulates the immune response and likely improves anti-tumor immunotherapy.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present an in vivo study that analyzes the effects of radiation on the immune response in tumor patients. As readout system, we utilized the reactivity of glioma patients' sera against antigen GLEA2 as the most frequent antigen immunogenic in glioblastoma patients. We established an ELISA assay to analyze reactivity of 24 glioblastoma patients over a period of several months. As control we used 30 sera from healthy donors as well as 30 sera from lung cancer patients. We compared the course of GLEA2 seroreactivity at different times prior, during and after radiation. The GLEA2 seroreactivity was increased by the time of surgery, decreased after surgery, increased again under radiation, and slightly decreased after radiation.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide in vivo evidence for an increased antibody response against tumor antigens under radiation. Antigens that become immunogenic with an increased antibody response as result of radiation can serve as ideal targets for immunotherapy of human tumors.",Excluded
1838,"One-photon and two-photon stimulation of neurons in a microfluidic culture system In this study, we demonstrate a novel platform for optical stimulation of neural circuits combined with a microfluidic culture method and microelectrode array measurements. Neuron-on-a-chip was designed and fabricated to isolate axons without a soma or dendrite. Thus, it is readily able to manipulate the neuronal alignment and to investigate the neuronal activity at the locations we want to observe. We adapted the optical stimulation technique to the arranged neurons to generate the neuronal signals in a non-invasive fashion. A blue light-emitting diode and a femtosecond laser with 780 nm center wavelength were used for neuronal activation and the corresponding neuronal signals were measured by MEAs at the same time. We found that one-photon light via caged glutamate provoked periodic spiking. In contrast, the femtosecond pulse irradiation generated repetitive firing at constant rates. Response times of one-photon and two-photon stimulation were around 200 ms and 50 ms, respectively. We also quantified neural responses, by varying optical parameters such as exposure time and irradiation power.",Excluded

MRIs were analyzed for presence of restricted diffusion, time to onset, pattern/location, duration of restriction, and persistence of restriction post-treatment with BEV.RESULTS: Patchy confluent areas of diffusion restriction on MRI were found in 12 patients. All 12 patients received radiation therapy followed by BEV therapy. Diffusion restriction appeared 3 to 21 months after onset of radiation and 1 to 6 months after starting BEV therapy, increased in size over time, and persisted up to 23 months while on BEV. Restricted diffusion was observed in areas that received 60 Gy or more of radiation. Areas of restricted diffusion showed low T1 and increased T2 signal intensity, minimal or no contrast enhancement, and low cerebral blood volume. A thin perimeter of susceptibility outlined the restricted areas on susceptibility-weighted images in nine patients (75%). Small focal areas of tumor recurrence within larger regions of restricted diffusion were evident in only four patients (33%). In seven patients (58%) the area of restricted diffusion showed necrosis or radiation change on histology or no metabolic activity on MR spectroscopy or PET.CONCLUSION: Restricted diffusion associated with BEV-treated cerebral gliomas occurs in regions of high-dose radiation and does not indicate high-cellularity of tumor recurrence.",Excluded
1586,"A prospective case control comparison of the ZeroGravity system versus a standard lead apron as radiation protection strategy in neuroendovascular procedures BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to compare the performance of the ZeroGravity (ZG) system (radiation protection system composed by a suspended lead suit) against the use of standard protection (lead apron (LA), thyroid shield, lead eyeglasses, table skirts, and ceiling suspended shield) in neuroangiography procedures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiation exposure data were prospectively collected in consecutive neuroendovascular procedures between December 2014 and February 2015. Operator No 1 was assigned to the use of an LA (plus lead glasses, thyroid shield, and a 1 mm hanging shield at the groin) while operator No 2 utilized the ZG system. Dosimeters were used to measure peak skin dose for the head, thyroid, and left foot.RESULTS: The two operators performed a total of 122 procedures during the study period. The ZG operator was more commonly the primary operator compared with the LA operator (85% vs 71%; p=0.04). The mean anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and cumulative dose area product (DAP) radiation exposure as well as the mean fluoroscopy time were not statistically different between the operators' cases. The peak skin dose to the head of the operator with LA was 2.1 times higher (3380 vs 1600 muSv), while the thyroid was 13.9 (4460 vs 320 muSv), the mediastinum infinitely (520 vs 0 muSv), and the foot 3.3 times higher (4870 vs 1470 muSv) compared with the ZG operator, leading to an overall accumulated dose 4 times higher. The ratio of cumulative operator received dose/total cumulative DAP was 2.5 higher on the LA operator.CONCLUSIONS: The ZG radiation protection system leads to substantially lower radiation exposure to the operator in neurointerventional procedures. However, substantial exposure may still occur at the level of the lens and thyroid to justify additional protection.",Excluded

1598,"Antiphosphatidylserine antibody combined with irradiation damages tumor blood vessels and induces tumor immunity in a rat model of glioblastoma PURPOSE: The vascular targeting antibody bavituximab is being combined with chemotherapy in clinical trials in cancer patients. Bavituximab targets the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylserine, complexed with beta2-glycoprotein I. Phosphatidylserine is normally intracellular but becomes exposed on the luminal surface of vascular endothelium in tumors. Phosphatidylserine exposure on tumor vessels is increased by chemotherapy and irradiation. Here, we determined whether treatment with the murine equivalent of bavituximab, 2aG4, combined with irradiation can suppress tumor growth in a rat model of glioblastoma.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: F98 glioma cells were injected into the brains of syngeneic rats where they grow initially as a solid tumor and then infiltrate throughout the brain. Rats with established tumors were treated with 10 Gy whole brain irradiation and 2aG4.RESULTS: Combination treatment doubled the median survival time of the rats, and 13% of animals were rendered disease free. Neither treatment given individually was as effective. We identified two mechanisms. First, irradiation induced phosphatidylserine exposure on tumor blood vessels and enhanced antibody-mediated destruction of tumor vasculature by monocytes/macrophages. Second, the antibody treatment induced immunity to F98 tumor cells, which are normally weakly immunogenic. Surviving rats were immune to rechallenge with F98 tumor cells. In vitro, 2aG4 enhanced the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to generate F98-specific cytotoxic T cells. Phosphatidylserine exposure, which is induced on tumor cells by irradiation, likely suppresses tumor antigen presentation, and 2aG4 blocks this tolerogenic effect.CONCLUSION: Bavituximab combined with radiotherapy holds promise as a vascular targeting and immune enhancement strategy for the treatment of human glioblastoma.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: One hundred twenty-eight 45-day-old Wistar rats received whole brain fractionated radiation (30 Gy), whereas 48 rats received sham irradiation. Four irradiated subgroups were defined: saline, 37.5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 150 mg/kg Ethyol. Sequential behavioral studies including one-way and two-way avoidance tasks were undertaken before and after radiation. Result(s): Before radiation, the performances of all groups were similar. For the one-way avoidance task, at 1, 3, and 6 months postradiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (75 or 150 mg/kg) irradiated rats (p <= 0.001). Nevertheless, lower percentage of avoidance (p <= 0.001) was only seen at 1 month postradiation in saline-irradiated rats, after comparison with their preradiation values. For the two-way avoidance task, performed only after radiation, saline-irradiated rats had a lower percentage of avoidance than sham- or Ethyol- (150 or 75 mg/kg) irradiated rats at 1, 2.5, 4.5, and 7.5 months (p = 0.000). Rats treated with Ethyol did not differ from sham-irradiated rats in both avoidance tasks, except for the 37.5 mg/kg-Ethyol group which showed lower performances 6 months postradiation (p = 0.005, one-way avoidance).

1695,"Temporal information loss in the macaque early visual system Stimuli that modulate neuronal activity are not always detectable, indicating a loss of information between the modulated neurons and perception. To identify where in the macaque visual system information about periodic light modulations is lost, signal-to-noise ratios were compared across simulated cone photoreceptors, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons, and perceptual judgements. Stimuli were drifting, threshold-contrast Gabor patterns on a photopic background. The sensitivity of LGN neurons, extrapolated to populations, was similar to the monkeys' at low temporal frequencies. At high temporal frequencies, LGN sensitivity exceeded the monkeys' and approached the upper bound set by cone photocurrents. These results confirm a loss of high-frequency information downstream of the LGN. However, this loss accounted for only about 5% of the total. Phototransduction accounted for essentially all of the rest. Together, these results show that low temporal frequency information is lost primarily between the cones and the LGN, whereas high-frequency information is lost primarily within the cones, with a small additional loss downstream of the LGN.",Excluded

1717,"Radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas Background: Radiosurgery has been established as an important alternative to microsurgery. We report our experience with radiosurgery for tumor control and the complications of unilateral vestibular schwannomas. Method(s): We reviewed our early experience regarding clinical presentation, management and outcomes in 45 patients with acoustic schwannomas who underwent gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery. The median follow-up period was 25 months (range, 6-48 months). Thirteen patients had undergone 1 or more previous resections before radiosurgery; 32 underwent radiosurgery as the first procedure. Median tumor volume was 4.5 mL (range, 0.5-30.0), and median radiotherapy dose was 11.5 Gy (range, 10.5-14.0 Gy). Result(s): Tumor control was achieved in 43 patients (95.6%). Loss of central contrast enhancement was a characteristic change and was noted in 29 patients (64.4%). Reduction in tumor size was shown in 15 patients (33.3%). Thirteen patients (28.9%) had good or serviceable hearing preoperatively, and in all of these, the preoperative status was retained immediately after radiosurgery. At follow-up, however, 10 patients (76.9%) had preserved hearing and 3 (23.1%) had reduced hearing on the treated side. Hearing in 1 patient that was not serviceable preoperatively later improved to a serviceable level. No patients had delayed facial palsy or lower cranial nerve dysfunction, but one had delayed trigeminal sensory loss. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery achieved a high tumor control rate and a relatively low post-radiosurgical complication rate for acoustic neuromas. Â© 2005 Elsevier. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1945,"Planning evaluation of C-arm cone beam ct angiography for target delineation in stereotactic radiation surgery of brain arteriovenous malformations Purpose: Stereotactic radiation surgery (SRS) is one of the therapeutic modalities currently available to treat cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Conventionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are used in combination to identify the target volume for SRS treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of C-arm cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the treatment planning of SRS for cerebral AVMs. Methods and Materials: Sixteen consecutive patients treated for brain AVMs at our institution were included in this retrospective study. Prior to treatment, all patients underwent MRA, DSA, and C-arm CBCT. All images were coregistered using the GammaPlan planning system. AVM regions were delineated independently by 2 physicians using either C-arm CBCT or MRA, resulting in 2 volumes: a CBCT volume (VCBCT) and an MRA volume (V<inf>MRA</inf>). SRS plans were generated based on the delineated regions. Results: The average volume of treatment targets delineated using C-arm CBCT and MRA were similar, 6.40 cm<sup>3</sup> and 6.98 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively (P=.82). However, significant regions of nonoverlap existed. On average, the overlap of the MRA with the C-arm CBCT was only 52.8% of the total volume. In most cases, radiation plans based on V<inf>MRA</inf> did not provide adequate dose to the region identified on C-arm CBCT; the mean minimum dose to V<inf>CBCT</inf> was 29.5%, whereas the intended goal was 45% (P<.001). The mean volume of normal brain receiving 12 Gy or more in C-arm CBCT-based plans was not greater than in the MRA-based plans. Conclusions: Use of C-arm CBCT images significantly alters the delineated regions of AVMs for SRS planning, compared to that of MRA/MRI images. CT-based planning can be accomplished without increasing the dose to normal brain and may represent a more accurate definition of the nidus, increasing the chances for successful obliteration.

1507,"Combined modality therapy including intraoperative electron irradiation for locally recurrent colorectal cancer PURPOSE: To evaluate survival, relapse patterns, and prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer relapse treated with curative-intent therapy, including intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: From April 1981 through January 2008, 607 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer received IOERT as a component of treatment. IOERT was preceded or followed by external radiation (median dose, 45.5 Gy) in 583 patients (96%). Resection was classified as R0 in 227 (37%), R1 in 224 (37%), and R2 in 156 (26%). The median IOERT dose was 15 Gy (range, 7.5-30 Gy).RESULTS: Median overall survival was 36 months. Five- and 10-year survival rates were 30% and 16%, respectively. Survival estimates at 5 years were 46%, 27%, and 16% for R0, R1, and R2 resection, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that R0 resection, no prior chemotherapy, and more recent treatment (in the second half of the series) were associated with improved survival. The 3-year cumulative incidence of central, local, and distant relapse was 12%, 23%, and 49%, respectively. Central and local relapse were more common in previously irradiated patients and in those with subtotal resection. Toxicity Grade 3 or higher partially attributable to IOERT was observed in 66 patients (11%). Neuropathy was observed in 94 patients (15%) and was more common with IOERT doses exceeding 12.5 Gy.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival and disease control was achievable in patients with locally recurrent colorectal cancer.

1666,"SIRT in primary and metastatic liver tumors Introduction: The liver is one of the most commonly involved organs for metastatic disease. The Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is EU approved since 2002 for treatment of primary or secondary hepatic malignancy. Methods and Results: The procedure exploits a normal physiological process: Healthy liver tissue receives most of its blood supply via the portal vein, while liver tumors receive the majority of their blood supply from the hepatic artery. The microscopic spheres, each approximately 15 to 35mum in diameter, are bonded to yttrium-90 (Y-90), a pure beta emitter with a physical half-life of 64 hours. The microspheres are trapped in the tumor's vascular bed, where they destroy the tumor by reducing its blood supply (embolic effect) and through local radiation damage to the cancer cells' DNA. Inclusion criteria for SIRT are unresectable liver-dominant or liver-only tumors, a life expectancy of more than 12 weeks and an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2. Exclusion criteria are clinical signs of liver failure (ascites, bilirubin >2.0 mg/ dL in absence of a reversible cause, serum albumin < 3.0 g/dL), a pretreatment scan showing >30 Gy exposure to the lungs or non-correctable shunting to the GI tract. Side effects are fatique, fever, nausea, abdominal pain. Potential complications are radiation gastritis, duodenitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis and radiation induced liver disease. SIRT is used in liver-only or liver-dominant disease in combination with systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) at 1<sup>st</sup>-line, 2nd-line or later. As monotherapy for mCRC and other metastatic disease and cholangiocarcinoma SIRT is used as salvage therapy in chemo-refractory patients. In hepatocellular carcinoma SIRT may potentially down-stage to reach respectability. In metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, irrespective of primary site, whether functional or non-functional, SIRT is used as first-or second-line therapy or in treatment-refractory disease. In these patients due to the much longer life expectancy re-treatment and fractionated SIRT appears possible, and may further extend disease control. Studies suggest earlier use may provide greater benefits. Conclusion(s): SIRT is a well tolerated therapy option for patients with malignant liver tumors not suitable for curative local interventions like surgery or ablation.",Excluded

The role of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is not well understood in this population. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SABR in treating well-differentiated neuroendocrine liver metastases (WD-NELM). METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients with WD-NELM treated with SABR between January 2015-July 2019. Demographic, treatment and clinical/radiographic follow-up data were abstracted. RECIST 1.1 criteria were applied to each individual target to evaluate the response to treatment. Local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) were determined using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Toxicity was reported according to CTCAE v5.0. RESULT(S): Twenty-five patients with a total of 53 liver metastases treated with SABR were identified. Most patients (68%) had midgut tumors, were Grade II (80%) and had high volume intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic disease (76%). Median number of liver metastases treated was 2 with a median size of 2.5 cm. Median radiation dose delivered was 50Gy/5 fractions. Median follow-up was 14 months; 24 of the 25 patients were alive at time of analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was 32%, with improvement or stability in 96% of lesions treated. The median time to best response was 9 months. The 1-year LC and PFS were 92% and 44% respectively. No Grade III/IV acute or late toxicity was identified.

Purpose/Objective(s): Lung adenocarcinomas are more commonly associated with metastatic disease to the brain as compared with other histologic types of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have been demonstrated to be both predictive and prognostic for patients with lung adenocarcinoma. However, its impact on brain metastases (BM) remains inconclusive. This study aimed to explore the potential association between EGFR mutation and the risk of BM in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Furthermore we also intended to identify other risk factors for BM, which may guide the selection of management strategies. Materials/Methods: Clinical data of 234 patients at our institution from March 2007 to November 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients in this cohort had known EGFR mutation status and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The relationships between EGFR mutation and BM at the initial presentation and at the last follow-up were analyzed. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the independent factors associated with BM. Result(s): A total of 76 out of 234 patients (32.5%) had developed BM during their disease course amongst 39 patients (16.7%) had BM at their initial diagnosis. Within the entire cohort, 108 patients (46.2%) had EGFR mutations. As compared with that of wild type EGFR patients, the frequency of EGFR mutation was statistically higher for patients with BM at the initial diagnosis (64.1% vs. 35.9%, P=0.014) and at the last follow-up (63.2% vs. 36.8%, P=0.000). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of extracranial metastases regardless of EGFR mutation status either at the time of diagnosis or at the last follow-up (40.9% vs. 59.1%, P=0.313; 43.3% vs. 56.7%, P=0.494). In Multivariate Logistic regression analysis, EGFR mutation was significantly associated with the risk for BM at the initial diagnosis (OR=0.393, 95% CI=0.165-0.943, P=0.034). Among those 195 patients without BM at initial diagnosis, 1- year and 2-year accumulative rates of subsequent BM were significantly different between the patients with EGFR-mutant and EGFR-wild disease (15.0% vs. 4.2%, 37.7% vs. 18.7%; P=0.001). In Multivariate Cox regression analysis, only EGFR mutation was the independent factor for the risk of BM (HR=3.446, p=0.000). Conclusion(s): In our study, we demonstrated that BM was more common among patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, which may represent one of the distinct clinical features for EGFR-mutant tumors. EGFR mutation was the only independent predictive and prognostic risk factor for BM. The potential utility of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma should be further explored.",Excluded

For instance, PET examination with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG, <sup>11</sup>C-methionine, <sup>11</sup>C-choline, or any other radiopharmaceutical can be carried out in just 7-15 min. after <sup>82</sup>Rb-chloride injection. Conclusion(s): Research demonstrated an effectiveness of <sup>82</sup>Rb-chloride application as a diagnostic agent in neurooncology. A method of dosing and administration of the generator-produced radiopharmaceutical has been worked out. It is possible to do up to 600 PET sessions using one Russian <sup>82</sup>Rb generator GR-01. The generator is proved to be reliable and easy to use. The interest in <sup>82</sup>Rb-chloride as a tumor-seeking radiopharmaceutical rose due to the active application of the modern devices PET/CT in the routine clinical practice.

1547,"Whole-body screening of atherosclerosis with magnetic resonance angiography With whole-body magnetic resonance angiography (WBMRA), it is possible to examine the whole arterial tree except intracranial and coronary vessels in a single examination without the risks involved in ionizing radiation or arterial cannulation. Whole-body magnetic resonance angiography is well suited for repeated clinical examinations in patients with systemic diseases such as vasculitis or atherosclerosis and can also be used for scientific purposes. On the basis of the WBMRA overview, a possible further development of the WBMRA concept can be to perform further acquisitions at sites with atherosclerotic plaques with higher-resolution scans to determine the degree of stenosis more accurately or to achieve plaque characterization. A total validation of WBMRA compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is not possible owing to the hazards of ionizing radiation. Studies have shown a high sensitivity and specificity for the pelvic and lower limb arteries in comparison with DSA. No systematic validation against DSA has been performed for the renal, aortic, and carotid arteries. Various methods have been used, however, for confirmation of vascular abnormalities found on WBMRA such as ultrasonography, dedicated MRA, or DSA, with reasonably high agreement. The WBMRA method has not been studied with regard to prediction of future cardiovascular (CV) events, as have intima media thickness, coronary artery calcium scoring, and the ankle-brachial index. The full usefulness of WBMRA in an epidemiological setting and as a complementary screening tool for assessing CV risk still needs to be validated against future CV events.

1444,"Driver or coincidence detector: modal switch of a corticothalamic giant synapse controlled by spontaneous activity and short-term depression Giant synapses between layer 5B (L5B) neurons of somatosensory (barrel) cortex and neurons of the posteromedial nucleus (POm) of thalamus reside in a key position of the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loop, yet their synaptic properties and contribution to CTC information processing remain poorly understood. Fluorescence-guided local stimulation of terminals were combined with postsynaptic whole-cell recordings in thalamus to study synaptic transmission at an identified giant synapse. We found large EPSCs mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and NMDA receptors. A single presynaptic electrical stimulus evoked a train of postsynaptic action potentials, indicating that a single L5B input can effectively drive the thalamic neuron. Repetitive stimulation caused strong short-term depression (STD) with fast recovery. To examine how these synaptic properties affect information transfer, spontaneous and evoked activity of L5B neurons was recorded in vivo and played back to giant terminals in vitro. We found that suprathreshold synaptic transmission was suppressed because of spontaneous activity causing strong STD of the L5B-POm giant synapse. Thalamic neurons only spiked after intervals of presynaptic silence or when costimulating two giant terminals. Therefore, STD caused by spontaneous activity of L5B neurons can switch the synapse from a ""driver mode"" to a ""coincidence mode."" Mechanisms decreasing spontaneous activity in L5B neurons and inputs synchronized by a sensory stimulus may thus gate the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop.",Excluded

2473,"Endothelial apoptosis initiates acute blood-brain barrier disruption after ionizing radiation Acute disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) is well recognized after radiation therapy to the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed the genetic regulation of acute BBB disruption and its relationship to vascular endothelial cell death in the CNS after irradiation. Adult rats were given graded single doses of X-ray to the cervical spinal cord. At different time intervals after irradiation, the irradiated spinal cord was processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Disruption of blood-spinal cord barrier was assessed using albumin immunohistochemistry, i.v. injection of Evans blue dye, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. In the rat spinal cord, there was a dose-dependent apoptotic response during the first 24 h after irradiation, and apoptotic cells consisted of both endothelial and glial cells, as described previously (1, 2). A dose-dependent reduction in endothelial cell density was observed at 24 h after irradiation. This was associated with a similar dose-dependent disruption in blood-spinal cord barrier as demonstrated by albumin immunohistochemistry. Radiation-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells has been shown to be dependent on the acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) pathway. After a single 50-Gy dose to the cervical spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was a 47.7% reduction in endothelial cell density at 24 h compared with nonirradiated controls. No decrease in endothelial cell density was observed in irradiated ASMase -/- mice. In the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was evidence of albumin immunoreactivity and Evans blue dye staining around microvessels, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid uptake increased at 24 h. Nonirradiated controls and the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase -/- mice demonstrated no evidence of leakage. We conclude that apoptosis of endothelial cells initiates acute BBB disruption in the CNS after irradiation and that acute BBB disruption after irradiation is mediated by the ASMase pathway.",Included
2163,"Secondary radiation damage as the main cause for unexpected volume effects: a histopathologic study of the parotid gland PURPOSE: To elucidate with a histopathological study the mechanism of region-dependent volume effects in the partly irradiated parotid gland of the rat.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Wistar rats were locally X-irradiated with collimators with conformal radiation portals for 100% volume and 50% cranial/caudal partial volumes. Single doses up to 40 Gy were applied. Parotid saliva samples were collected, and the three lobes of the parotid gland were examined individually on the macro- and micromorphologic level up to 1 year after irradiation.RESULTS: Dose-dependent loss of gland weight was observed 1 year after total or partial X-irradiation. Weight loss of the glands correlated very well with loss of secretory function. Irradiating the cranial 50% volume (implicating a shielded lateral lobe) resulted in substantially more damage in terms of weight loss and loss of secretory function than 50% caudal irradiation (shielding the ventral and dorsal lobe). Histologic examinations of the glands 1 year after irradiation revealed that the shielded lateral lobe was severely affected, in contrast to the shielded ventral and dorsal lobes. Time studies showed that irradiation of the cranial 50% volume caused late development of secondary damage in the shielded lateral lobe, becoming manifest between 240 and 360 days after irradiation. The possible clinical significance of this finding is discussed.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the observed region-dependent volume effect for late function loss in the rat parotid gland after partial irradiation is mainly caused by secondary events in the shielded lateral lobe. The most probable first step (primary radiation event) in the development of this secondary damage is radiation exposure to the hilus region (located between the ventral and dorsal lobe). By injuring major excretory ducts and supply routes for blood and nerves in this area, the facility system necessary for proper functioning of the nonexposed lateral lobe is seriously affected. The unexpected volume effect in the rat might have consequences for treatment strategies in radiotherapy, implicating not only salivary glands but also other organs with a seemingly homogeneous distribution of radiosensitive elements, a situation wherein volume effects have not been anticipated up to now.",Included

2050,"Intracranial applications of mr imaging-guided focused ultrasound Initially used in the treatment of prostate cancer and uterine fibroids, the role of focused ultrasound has expanded as transcranial acoustic wave distortion and other limitations have been overcome. Its utility relies on focal energy deposition via acoustic wave propagation. The duty cycle and intensity of focused ultrasound influence the rate of energy deposition and result in unique physiologic and biomechanical effects. Thermal ablation via high-intensity continuous exposure generates coagulative necrosis of tissues. High-intensity, pulsed application reduces temporally averaged energy deposition, resulting in mechanical effects, including reversible, localized BBB disruption, which enhances neurotherapeutic agent delivery. While the precise mechanisms remain unclear, low-intensity, pulsed exposures can influence neuronal activity with preservation of cytoarchitecture. Its noninvasive nature, high-resolution, radiationfree features allow focused ultrasound to compare favorably with other modalities. We discuss the physical characteristics of focused ultrasound devices, the biophysical mechanisms at the tissue level, and current and emerging applications.",Excluded

1706,"Cycling hypoxia increases U87 glioma cell radioresistance via ROS induced higher and long-term HIF-1 signal transduction activity Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors are the most common type of brain tumors and resistance to radiotherapy. This study aimed to investigate the differential effect and mechanism of tumor microenvironments, cycling hypoxia and non-interrupted hypoxia, on tumor cell radiosensitivity in the human U87 glioblastoma tumor model. We exposed U87 cells and mice bearing U87 glioma to experimentally imposed cycling or non-interrupted hypoxic stress in vitro and in vivo prior to treatment with ionizing irradiation. Clonogenic survival assay and tumor growth measurements were performed to determine tumor radiosensitivity. The differential regulation of non-interrupted vs. cycling hypoxia by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and the impact of HIF-1alpha on hypoxia-induced radioresistance were assessed by molecular assay and RNAi-knockdown technology. Our results demonstrated that cycling hypoxia induced higher and longer term HIF-1 signal transduction activity via reactive oxygen species (ROS) in U87 cells compared with non-interrupted hypoxia. Cycling hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha activation reflected ROS mediated HIF-1alpha synthesis and stabilization, whereas non-interrupted hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha activation was due to decreased HIF-1alpha degradation resulting from decreased prolyl hydroxylation. With regard to tumor radiosensitivity, cycling hypoxia induced more tumor cell radioresistance and a decreased response to radiotherapy in U87 cells compared with non-interrupted hypoxia. HIF-1 knockdown during in vitro and in vivo hypoxic stresses combined with radiotherapy suppressed cycling and non-interrupted hypoxia-induced radioresistance while increasing overall tumor radiosensitivity. Our results suggest that cycling hypoxia induces more radioresistance than non-interrupted hypoxia in U87 gliomas, and ROS mediated HIF-1alpha activation is a crucial mechanism involved in hypoxia-induced differential radioresistant in U87 gliomas.",Excluded

2074,"Exposure to long-term evolution radiofrequency electromagnetic fields decreases neuroblastoma cell proliferation via Akt/mTOR-mediated cellular senescence The aim of this study was to examine the potential effects of long-term evolution (LTE) radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) on cell proliferation using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. The growth rate and proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells were significantly decreased upon exposure to 1760 MHz RF-EMF at 4 W/kg specific absorption rate (SAR) for 4 hr/day for 4 days. Cell cycle analysis indicated that the cell cycle was delayed in the G0/G1 phase after RF-EMF exposure. However, DNA damage or apoptosis was not involved in the reduced cellular proliferation following RF-EMF exposure because the expression levels of histone H2A.X at Ser139 (gammaH2AX) were not markedly altered and the apoptotic pathway was not activated. However, SH-SY5Y cells exposed to RF-EMF exhibited a significant elevation in Akt and mTOR phosphorylation levels. In addition, the total amount of p53 and phosphorylated-p53 was significantly increased. Data suggested that Akt/mTOR-mediated cellular senescence led to p53 activation via stimulation of the mTOR pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. The transcriptional activation of p53 led to a rise in expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27. Further, subsequent inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4 produced a fall in phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb at Ser807/811), which decreased cell proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to RF-EMF might induce Akt/mTOR-mediated cellular senescence, which may delay the cell cycle without triggering DNA damage in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.

2167,"Persistent calcium current in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons The suprachiasmatic nuclei contain the primary circadian clock, and suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons exhibit a diurnal modulation of spontaneous firing rate. The present study examined the voltage-gated persistent Ca(2+) current, in acutely isolated rat suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons using a ramp-type voltage-clamp protocol. Slow triangular voltage-clamp commands from a holding potential of -85 mV to +5 mV elicited inward current (100-400 pA) that was completely blocked by Cd(2+). This current showed little or no hysteresis, and was identified as persistent Ca(2+) current. The threshold for persistent Ca(2+) current ranged between -60 and -45 mV, and it was maximal at about -8 mV. Nifedipine at 10-20 microM blocked 80-100%. To assess the role of persistent Ca(2+) current in the generation of spontaneous action potentials in both acutely isolated and intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons, the effect of Cd(2+) and nifedipine on firing rate was studied using on-cell recording. Application of Cd(2+) exerted a weak excitatory effect and nifedipine had no significant effect on the spontaneous firing rate of isolated suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. In all intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations (n=15), Cd(2+) slowly inhibited spontaneous firing; in high-frequency firing cells (four of 15), a transient increase of firing rate preceded inhibition. No significant effect of nifedipine on firing rate of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons was found. Therefore, persistent Ca(2+) current itself (as carrier of charge) does not appear to contribute significantly to spontaneous firing of suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. A slowly developing inhibitory effect of Cd(2+) on spontaneous firing of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations may be due to penetration of Cd(2+) through Ca(2+) channels, and its subsequent effect on intracellular mechanisms, while the transient increase of firing rate in high-frequency firing neurons is probably due to inhibition of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current.",Excluded
1241,"Intraspecific variation in retinal cone distribution in the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei Studies of visual ecology have typically focused on differences among species while paying less attention to variation among populations and/or individuals. Here, we show that the relative abundance of UV, violet, yellow, and red cones varies between two populations of bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei. Animals from a spring population (high-transmission UV/blue light) have a higher frequency of UV and violet cones and a lower frequency of yellow and red cones than animals from a swamp population (low-transmission UV/blue light). Visual sensitivity does not vary significantly between the populations, but spring animals tend to be more sensitive in the UV/blue wavelengths (360-440 nm) and less sensitive in longer wavelengths (560-600 nm) than swamp animals. The results have two important implications. First, the tight conservation of functional regions of opsin genes across taxa does not imply that visual systems are constrained in their evolution; differential sensitivity can arise through differential expression of cone classes within the retina. Second, intraspecific visual signals in this species may evolve to maximize contrast between the signaler and the background (as opposed to brightness); males with blue anal fins are most abundant in swamp habitats where animals express fewer UV and violet cones.",Excluded

[French] Between 1962 and 1986, 32 patients with intracranial meningiomas were referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy for external radiotherapy either after incomplete surgery, or unfavorable histology (meningiosarcoma/anaplastic meningioma), or after recurrences. In the latter case, the mean time interval between the first surgery and the recurrence was 2 years (range: 1-6 years). Radiotherapy was performed using photons, electrons or mixed phetons-electrons. The mean total dose was 48 Gy (range: 9-65 Gy) delivered in a mean time of 35 days with a 19 mean number of fractions. Radiotherapy was interrupted in three cases at 9 Gy-17 Gy-20 Gy because of neurological worsening. The actuarial 5-year survival was 64%. Among the 32 patients, 11 died, eight of tumoral progression or recurrence and three of other causes (one ovarian carcinoma, two unknown). Among the 21 alive patients, eight presented a recurrence; five of them could be reoperated on with two complete resections. None of the following factors were found to be of prognostic value on the survival nor on the recurrence occurrence: age, tumor location, first surgical resection type, and, in the group of patients treated at the time of recurrence, the quality of the surgery at the time of recurrence and the time interval between the first surgery and the recurrence. Only one factor was evidenced as of significant value on the recurrence as well as the 10-year survival: the total dose of irradiation with a 10-year survival rate of 74% for total doses higher than or equal to 47 Gy versus 14% when the total dose was lower than 47 Gy.",Excluded

D lesion rats (n equal to 2) did not differ from controls in one-way avoidance learning, except in terms of prolonged escape latencies during the first three trials. The previously reported increased sensitivity to painful stimuli subsequent to medial forebrain bundle lesions or para-chlorophenylalanine administration, therefore, does not appear to be due exclusively to disruption of ascending 5-HT fibers originating in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei. The effects of midbrain raphe lesions of avoidance learning, furthermore, depend on lesion locus, and are not due to either hypo- or hyperalgesia.",Excluded

Digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and targeted sequencing showed that total and tumor-specific cfDNA levels increased in response to radiotherapy in both early- and advanced-stage NSCLC patients.

The patients were divided into three groups, according to the time following completion of RT. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and gray matter (GM) volume were determined. The DTI data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics and the GM volume was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Compared with the pre-RT group, the mean FA values in the left parietal lobe white matter (WM) and right cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05). In addition, the mean FA values in the right parietal lobe WM decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05), compared with the pre-RT group. The FA level in the right temporal lobe remained significantly decreased, compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT. Furthermore, compared with pre-RT group, the GM volume in the bilateral frontal lobe, right occipital lobe, left parietal lobe, right temporal lobe and left cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05), and in the bilateral temporal lobe, parietal lobe, right frontal lobe and left cerebellum, the GM volume decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05).

The response characteristics of EBT3 have been determined for the high dose range. The application of the film in SRS/SRT quality assurance testing has been evaluated. Method(s): The response characteristics of EBT3 (Lot# 07221303) were examined using an Epson Expression 10000XL flatbed scanner in combination with ImageJ and RIT software. Red, green and blue channel responses were analysed for 0-40 Gy. Green channel inter and intra film uniformity, dose rate dependence and post exposure darkening were characterised at high doses. Film uniformity was compared using two films from the same batch, each divided into 16 equal pieces and irradiated with 15 Gy. The characterisation was complemented by verifying a cranial SRS treatment with the film positioned in a LucyTM phantom. Result(s): The dose response curves of the three colour channels were compared across a 0-40 Gy dose range. Green channel analysis was found to be optimal for doses above 10 Gy due to its wider dynamic range. The dose response curves of two 6 MV beams delivered at 1000 MU/min and 600 MU/min rep rate across a 0-40 Gy dose range were found to agree with a maximum variation of 1.3%. The postirradiation darkening of EBT3 for 10, 15 and 25 Gy was determined. The dose distribution of an iPlanTM SRS treatment was verified.

1348,"Enhancement of dosimetric optimization for stereotactic radiosurgery. [French] Stereotactic radiosurgery is a technique for treatment of intracranial lesions requiring high precision in all steps - from image acquisition to final irradiation. One of most difficult steps is the treatment planning phase, consisting of determination of irradiation parameters sufficient to cover the target volume by avoiding sensitive volumes. A manual and empirical definition can be very long and difficult, especially in the case of complex target volumes situated in sensitive zones. As in conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery has taken advantages from dosimetric optimization. The question is: 'What is the configuration of irradiation parameters used in order to obtain the treatment plan by satisfying defined constraints?'. The purpose of this article is to summarize optimization methods used in radiosurgery and to describe the technical alternatives proposed for this treatment as well as the possibilities of plan evaluation between different techniques. This purpose will be illustrated by the optimization methodology used in the Center Oscar Lambret of Lille, France for the radiosurgical treatment with linear accelerator.",Excluded

The paper covers cardiovascular and exercise physiology, barophysiology and decompression sickness, renal stone risk, immunology, neurovestibular and sensorimotor function, nutrition, pharmacotherapeutics, and reproduction. Potential health and functional impacts associated with the various physiological changes during spaceflight are discussed, and areas needing additional research are highlighted. Historically, studies of physiological responses to microgravity have not been aimed at examining gender-specific differences in the astronaut population. Insufficient data exist in most of the discipline areas at this time to draw valid conclusions about gender-specific differences in astronauts, in part due to the small ratio of women to men. The only astronaut health issue for which a large enough data set exists to allow valid conclusions to be drawn about gender differences is orthostatic intolerance following shuttle missions, in which women have a significantly higher incidence of presyncope during stand tests than do men. The most common observation across disciplines is that individual differences in physiological responses within genders are usually as large as, or larger than, differences between genders.

1238,"Effect of hypoxia on the contents of endogenous opioid peptides and cyclic nucleotides in rat brain. [Japanese] Effect of hypoxia on the contents of beta-endorphin, dynorphin, cAMP and cGMP was investigated in rat brain. Rats were divided into three groups, each of which was intraperitoneally injected with morphine (5 mg/kg), naloxone (5 mg/kg) or saline. Each group was further divided into two subgroups: normoxia and hypoxia (5% oxygen, 95% nitrogen for 10 min). After exposure to microwave irradiation for metabolic fixation, nine regions of the brian were excised, homogenized and extracted of opioid peptides and cyclic nucleotides to measure them by the radioimmunoassay technique. Hypoxia mainly produced changes of the contents of opioid peptides and cyclic nucleotides in the hypothalamic pituitary system, suggesting the activation of the endocrine system in response to hypoxic stress. Injection of morphine or naloxone prior to exposure to hypoxia had little effect on the contents of beta-endorphin and dynorphin suggesting that influences of morphine and naloxone on survival rate against hypoxia are not mediated by endogenous opioid peptides in the brain.",Excluded
2379,"Gravity and Mastoid Effusion BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic mastoid effusions have recently been observed in astronauts returning from long-term spaceflight. In hospitalized patients, mastoid effusion increases the risks for bacterial otitis and mastoiditis. We reasoned that cephalad fluid shifts during strict -6degree head down tilt bed rest could reproduce space-flight associated mastoid effusion and that artificial gravity may reverse the response.METHODS: The recent Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study-European Space Agency study (AGBRESA) tested influences of artificial gravity during 60 days head down bed rest on a short-arm human centrifuge in healthy participants. The two intervention groups received daily artificial gravity with 30 minutes continuous artificial gravity or intermittent artificial gravity. A third group served as a control group and received no artificial gravity. We assessed cranial magnetic resonance images for mastoid effusions 1 day before bed rest, at days 14 and 52 of bed rest, and 3 days after bed rest.RESULTS: None of the participants exhibited mastoid effusions before bed rest. Six participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 14 (4 continuous, 2 intermittent, 0 control). Fifteen participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 52 and 3 days after bed rest (7 continuous, 3 intermittent, 5 control).CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid effusions commonly occur during strict head down tilt bed rest. The model can be applied to study the mechanisms and potential countermeasures for space flight-associated mastoid effusions. Formation of mastoid effusions during head down tilt bed rest is not prevented by daily 30 minutes short-arm intermittent or continuous centrifugation.",Excluded
1711,"Prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm for head and neck paragangliomas Purpose/Objective(s): Paragangliomas of the head and neck represent a wide range of predominantly indolent tumors which may cause serious functional deficits if ignored yet its treatment may result in severe iatrogenic morbidity. Surgery and radiation therapy are both established modalities when treatment is warranted but how to integrate these two modalities to optimize tumor control, minimize iatrogenic morbidity and preserve organ function is not clearly established. To this end, a prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm was established at our center over the past decade. Patients were diagnosed by anatomic and functional imaging characteristics typically determined by CT/MRI and octreotide avidity. In general, patients who had a solitary carotid body tumor were offered surgery; while those involving the skull base were offered radiation therapy and those with multiple paragangliomas were offered either surgery for the smaller tumor and radiation for the remaining tumors or radiation for all tumors. Materials/Methods: From 1998-2011, 51 patients (42F:9M) were treated with definitive radiation therapy. Median age was 64 years (range, 19-92 year). Paraganglioma subsites were as follows: jugular 44% (n=24), tympanic 20% (n=11), vagal 15% (n=8), carotid body 13% (n=7), parasympathetic 2% (n=1). Two patients had bilateral tumors, while 2 patients had 3 synchronous tumors. The median radiation dose was 45 Gy (21-50.4 Gy) treated with 3D technique in 72% (n=39), IMRT in 20% (n=11) or SBRT 2% (n=1). During this time period, 38 patients underwent primary surgery of whom 6 received adjuvant radiation therapy. Result(s): At a median follow-up of 34 months (4-103 mos), one patient treated with radiation therapy failed at 37 months for a 3 year actuarial LC 100% and 5 year LC 94%. None of the 38 surgically treated failed. Patients who received radiation therapy experienced grade 1/2 complications including mucositis (13%) or xerostomia (23%), and two patients developed dizziness (5%). Of patients who underwent surgical excision, four patients had post-operative cranial nerve deficits, including vocal fold paresis, Horner's syndrome, hearing loss, and temporary facial nerve weakness. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this experience represents the first prospective algorithmic-based multidisciplinary approach with an emphasis on single modality treatment that demonstrates excellent tumor control, low rates of severe iatrogenic morbidity and long-term function preservation. While both surgery and radiation result in excellent tumor control, radiation therapy should be considered a primary treatment for skull-based paraganglioma for which it offers a high therapeutic ratio.",Excluded
1775,"Topiramate and cortical excitability in humans: a study with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered at 5 Hz frequency and suprathreshold intensity progressively increases the size of muscle evoked potentials (MEPs) and the duration of the cortical silent period (CSP) in normal subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of topiramate (TPM) at different doses on cortical excitability variables tested with rTMS. We tested the facilitation of the MEP size and CSP duration evoked by focal rTMS in eight patients before and after treatment with TPM at different doses for chronic neuropathic pain. In each patient, rTMS (5 Hz frequency-120% resting motor threshold) was applied at baseline and during the TPM induction phase (drug intake schedule: week I 25 mg/day, week II 50 mg/day, week III 75 mg/day, week IV 100 mg/day) and total TPM plasma concentrations were measured. The effects on the MEP size of 5 Hz-rTMS delivered over repeated sessions were tested in eight control subjects. TPM had no effect on the resting motor threshold. Antiepileptic treatment at increasing doses abolished the normal rTMS-induced MEP facilitation. ANOVA showed that this was a dose-related effect. Accordingly, in patients receiving TPM at higher doses (75 and 100 mg) rTMS failed to elicit the MEP facilitation. TPM left the progressive lengthening of the CSP during the rTMS train unchanged. In control subjects, rTMS applied over repeated sessions elicited a constant increase in MEP size. Our results suggest that TPM modulates the excitatory intracortical interneurons probably by altering rTMS-induced synaptic potentiation. These drug-induced effects are related to TPM doses and plasma concentrations. In conclusion, rTMS may be useful for quantifying the effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs and for assessing individual responses to different drugs but acting through similar mechanisms, thus combining functional neurophysiological information and laboratory data.",Excluded

Mutagenesis at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus was measured 56 days following whole-body irradiation with JANUS neutrons (single doses, 50-150 cGy) or 60Co photons (single doses, 250-750 cGy). Splenic T lymphocytes from B6CF1 mice were grown in round-bottomed 96-microwell culture plates with or without the selective agent 6-thioguanine (6-TG). The mutant frequency, as a result of exposure to neutrons or 60Co photons, increased 100-fold with dose. Doses of 150 cGy neutrons and 750 cGy 60Co photons were equally mutagenic. When animals were injected with WR-2721 at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight, i.p., 30 min before whole-body irradiation with JANUS neutrons or 60Co photons, mutant frequencies were significantly reduced at all radiation doses (i.e. protection factors of 1.4 and 2.4, respectively). Thus, the aminothiols are effective antimutagens. A novel clinical application of these compounds could be in their use to protect against radiation- and/or chemotherapy-induced genotoxic damage to normal cells.",Included
1728,"Measurements and models of electric fields in the in vivo human brain during transcranial electric stimulation Transcranial electric stimulation aims to stimulate the brain by applying weak electrical currents at the scalp. However, the magnitude and spatial distribution of electric fields in the human brain are unknown. We measured electric potentials intracranially in ten epilepsy patients and estimated electric fields across the entire brain by leveraging calibrated current-flow models. When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.8 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (r = 0.86) and depth (r = 0.88) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments. This is the first study to validate and calibrate current-flow models with in vivo intracranial recordings in humans, providing a solid foundation to target stimulation and interpret clinical trials.",Excluded
1217,"Routine Postoperative Computed Tomography Is Not Helpful After Elective Craniotomy Background: Next-day postoperative computed tomography (CT) has been routinely used to obtain radiographic ""clearance"" for transferring patients after elective craniotomy out of the intensive care unit. The value of this traditional policy, however, has repeatedly been questioned. However, the limited patient numbers might have underestimated the very rare, but catastrophic, events. Therefore, we analyzed the value of routine postoperative CT in a larger cohort of elective tumor, epilepsy, and vascular cases. Method(s): All the patients who had undergone elective craniotomy were included in our study. The routine postoperative CT scans were analyzed by a neuroradiologist who was unaware of the clinical data. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed for events of arterial hypertension and clinical deterioration. Result(s): The data from 660 patients with tumors (n = 393; 59.5%), aneurysms (n = 107; 16.2%), and skull base lesions were evaluated. In nearly one half of the patients (n = 264; 45.8%), CT depicted the presence of blood that was not associated with symptoms. Of the 660 patients, 21 (3.6%) showed a mass effect radiographically, 11 of whom underwent revision surgery. Arterial hypertension was documented in only 8 patients (1.3%) and was related to the revision surgery (P = 0.018). The overall revision rate was 2.7% (n = 18). All patients who had undergone revision for postoperative hematoma had presented with a new neurological deficit immediately before CT. Conclusion(s): Routine postoperative CT did not reveal 1 patient with a serious hematoma that would not have been identified by clinical examination. Patients could be transferred safely from the intensive care unit, if the weaning process and clinical observation findings were uneventful, without deterioration of neurological symptoms or consciousness.

2364,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded

2251,"To examine the gene expression alterations in a rat's brain by GSM900 MHz Objective: To examine the gene expression alterations in a rat's brain, treated by non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation from 900MHz-GSM mobile phone is main aim of this study. Background(s): As studies supported electromagnetic radiation may cause membrane leakage due to loss of calcium. Membrane leakage of lysosomes release DNAase which explains the fragmentation of DNA seen in cells exposed to mobile phone signals. Damage to DNA is a fundamental mechanism for developing tumors and cancer. The possibility of retaining mutations and cancer starting depends on when DNA damage exceeds the rate of DNA repair. DNA damage in brain cells can affect neurological functions and also possibly lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Method(s): In this study, we investigated whether an exposure of GSM-900 MHz irradiation from the Mobile Phone (3hours/day up to 28 days) could lead to the modulation of gene expression pattern in the rat brain. All rats were habitualised for one week prior to start the experiment in well designed circular mobile phone exposure (CCPE) cage. CCPE cage was specially designed for EMR exposure by mobile phone on the rats in the natural environment and it placed inside the exposure room where other electric appliances were not installed. In the cage, a mobile phone was placed in the center and rats were allowed to move around the device within 10 cm. radius. After 28 days, mRNA from the brain of control, sham and GSM-900 MHz exposed rats were isolated and subjected to Quantitative Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) array analysis. Gene expression was measured and expressed in fold change as described by Bandhyopadhay et.al. (2006). The qRT-PCR was performed by using Sybr green chemistry on ABI 7900HT platform. The real time quantification of amplification was done by measuring change in fluorescence by SDS2.3 software and further analyze by RQ manager. Result(s): Thus the results obtained from this study have shown that there is no significant change in expressions of genes involved in DNA damage and repair pathways such as chromatin assembly (CHAF1A), DNA damage checkpoints (Chk1), DNA synthesis (POLD1), post-transcriptional processes (RBM4), translation synthesis (POLI) and stress signaling (Hsp90) as compared with controls.

1291,"Pre-clinical implementation of a small animal image-guided irradiator Purpose/Objective: Poor precision and large field sizes used in conventional pre-clinical experiments are stumbling blocks for a fair comparison to clinical practice, where advanced RT techniques are commonly used. In addition the open problems in radiation oncology and radiobiology and the large number of possible interactions of targeted drugs in specific treatments cannot rely on clinical trials alone and emphasize the need of pre-clinical radiation research. In recent years several solutions have been proposed and here we present the implementation of a small animal IGRT (muIGRT) system (XRAD 225Cx, Precision X-Ray Inc., USA). Material(s) and Method(s): The system is designed to be able to reproduce the clinical IGRT practice and equipped with a kV x-rays source (20-225 kVp), a computer controlled couch and a high resolution a-Si detector (XRD 0820 AN, Perkin Elmer, USA) with a CsI scintillator, 200 mum pixel pitch and 1024x1024 pixels. It is designed to image (CBCT) the subject, target the area to be irradiated, position this area in the irradiation center and treat with field size down to 1 mm from different angles. This gives the possibility to perform fractionated therapy, study partial volume and dose effects and normal tissue toxicity. Result(s): Dosimetric and geometric commissioning has shown the calibrated system delivers doses (with reproducibility sigma=0.14, 0.14, 0.06 mm for LR, SI and AP respectively) in small fields (2.5 Gy/min for 5 mm field size) with 0.1 mm in-vivo targeting accuracy. The efficacy of fractionated muIGRT (4x5 Gy, 5 mm field) has been shown on various stereotactic intracranial tumour bearing mouse models (xenograft and spontaneous) where muIGRT allows local delivery of dose higher than previously used. Here the inter- and intrafraction movement has been assessed, by using image registration, to be 1.2 mm and below 0.1 mm RMS, respectively (under isoflurane anaesthesia). The additional use of multi-modality image registration (MRI to CBCT) helps improving the tumour localization of 0.3 mm (the tumour injection bore-hole used as landmark in CBCT already decreases the localization uncertainty). Normal tissue toxicity studies have been carried on for partial volume irradiation of the heart. gammaH2Ax staining of heart tissue radiation damage proved that it is feasible to accurately irradiate either the apex or the base of the heart by using image-guidance and a field size of 2.5 mm. It has been shown that left lung irradiation can be minimized while the right lung can be spared. (Figure presented). Conclusion(s): In conclusion we showed the calibrated system is capable of delivering reproducible treatments in pre-clinically convenient delivery time.

The treatment has involved a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, yet these modalities rarely extend the life of patients to more than one year from diagnosis. Integrins are expressed in tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells. Cilengitide is the first integrin inhibitor in clinical Phase III trial for glioblastoma. However, the effects of Cilengitide on these processes have not been sufficiently examined. In this study, we investigated the anti-glioma effect of Cilengitide using DNA microarray analysis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: U87DEGFR cells (human malignant glioma cell line) were used for this experiment. The cells were harvested after 16 h of Cilengitide treatment, and mRNA was extracted. Gene expression analysis, gene ontology analysis, and pathway analysis were performed using a DNA microarray (CodeLink TM Human Whole Genome Bioarray).We validated the dysregulated genes with Q-PCR analysis and Western blotting. RESULT(S): The expression of 265 genes was changed with Cilengitide treatment. The expression of 214 genes was up-regulated by more than 4-fold and the expression of 51 genes was down-regulated by more than 4-fold compared to the controls. In gene ontology analysis, genes that were associated with ""activation of pro-apoptotic gene products"" were over-represented, and genes that were associated with ""negative regulation of neuron apoptosis"" were over-represented.

1287,"Leptin restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a chronic unpredictable stress model of depression and reverses glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling Stress and glucocorticoid stress hormones inhibit neurogenesis, whereas antidepressants increase neurogenesis and block stress-induced decrease in neurogenesis. Our previous studies have shown that leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone with antidepressant-like properties, promotes baseline neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. This study aimed to determine whether leptin is able to restore suppression of neurogenesis in a rat chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model of depression. Chronic treatment with leptin reversed the CUS-induced reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis and depression-like behaviors. Leptin treatment elicited a delayed long-lasting antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim behavioral despair test, and this effect was blocked by ablation of neurogenesis with X-irradiation. The functional isoform of the leptin receptor, LepRb, and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were colocalized in hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro. Leptin treatment reversed the GR agonist dexamethasone (DEX)-induced reduction of proliferation of cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from adult hippocampus. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that leptin and DEX converged on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and beta-catenin. While DEX decreased Ser9 phosphorylation and increased Tyr216 phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, leptin increased Ser9 phosphorylation and attenuated the effects of DEX at both Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation sites of GSK-3beta. Moreover, leptin increased total level and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, a primary substrate of GSK-3beta and a key regulator in controlling hippocampal neural progenitor cell proliferation, and reversed the inhibitory effects of DEX on beta-catenin. Taken together, our results suggest that adult neurogenesis is involved in the delayed long-lasting antidepressant-like behavioral effects of leptin, and leptin treatment counteracts chronic stress and glucocorticoid-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis via activating the GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway.",Excluded

1630,"Characterization of Na+-activated K+ currents in larval lamprey spinal cord neurons Potassium channels play an important role in controlling neuronal firing and synaptic interactions. Na(+)-activated K(+) (K(Na)) channels have been shown to exist in neurons in different regions of the CNS, but their physiological function has been difficult to assess. In this study, we have examined if neurons in the spinal cord possess K(Na) currents. We used whole cell recordings from isolated spinal cord neurons in lamprey. These neurons display two different K(Na) currents. The first was transient and activated by the Na(+) influx during the action potentials, and it was abolished when Na(+) channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin. The second K(Na) current was sustained and persisted in tetrodotoxin. Both K(Na) currents were abolished when Na(+) was substituted with choline or N-methyl-D-glucamine, indicating that they are indeed dependent on Na(+) influx into neurons. When Na(+) was substituted with Li(+), the amplitude of the inward current was unchanged, whereas the transient K(Na) current was reduced but not abolished. This suggests that the transient K(Na) current is partially activated by Li(+). These two K(Na) currents have different roles in controlling the action potential waveform. The transient K(Na) appears to act as a negative feedback mechanism sensing the Na(+) influx underlying the action potential and may thus be critical for setting the amplitude and duration of the action potential. The sustained K(Na) current has a slow kinetic of activation and may underlie the slow Ca(2+)-independent afterhyperpolarization mediated by repetitive firing in lamprey spinal cord neurons.",Excluded

It constitutes less than 1 % of all intracranial tumors and approximately 2-4 % of all meningeal tumors. The authors present our institute's experience in combined modality management of 15 successive patients of HPC. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 15 patients of HPC treated in our institute from 2001 to 2011. Clinical characteristics and treatment modality, in the form of surgery and radiotherapy, were noted. Statistical analysis was done with regards to recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results The median age of the patients was 40.0 years. Nine patients were males and six patients were females. The median duration of symptoms was six months. Headache was the most common presenting symptom followed by vomiting, motor weakness and seizures. Twelve patients underwent total excision while three had subtotal excision. Seven patients had WHO grade II histology tumors and eight patients had grade III histology. Thirteen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Median RT dose delivered was 50 Gy. Five patients developed local recurrence. One patient had distant metastases. Median duration of RFS was 68 months. Conclusions HPCs are aggressive tumors. The mainstay of therapy is gross total resection at the initial surgery. Postoperative adjuvant RT should be offered to all patients, regardless of the degree of resection achieved. Long-term followup is important as local recurrences and distant metastases can develop years after the initial treatment. Â© Springer-Verlag 2012.",Excluded

The cohort consists of 60,205 people. Over a 65-year follow up period 14,830 deaths from all diseases of the circulatory system were registered. Out of this number 6,163 deaths were from ischemic heart disease, and 4,388 deaths were from cerebrovascular diseases. Analysis was performed on the basis of individualized estimates of dose accumulated in muscle tissue (both internal and external components of the dose), calculated with new Techa River Dosimetry System 2016. As per the latest calculations, mean dose to muscle tissue in members of the combined cohort was 34 mGy, maximum dose was 995 mGy. Simple parametric model of excess relative risk (ERR) was used in the analysis. The number of person-years at risk was 1836,203. The findings of the analysis show linear increase of mortality risk per unit dose from all the disease of circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy was 3%; 95% CI: 0,8%; 5,2%) and from ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy was 9,2%; 95% CI: 5,4%; 13,5%). with 15-year latent period. No statistically significant increase in mortality from the cerebrovascular diseases in the combined cohort of the population exposed in the Southern Urals over a 65-year period received evidence. The obtained results are in good agreement with those received in the analysis of the effect in the Techa River Cohort in 2013.

1667,"Nitric oxide transiently converts synaptic inhibition to excitation in retinal amacrine cells Nitric oxide (NO) is generated by multiple cell types in the vertebrate retina, including amacrine cells. We investigate the role of NO in the modulation of synaptic function using a culture system containing identified retinal amacrine cells. We find that moderate concentrations of NO alter GABA(A) receptor function to produce an enhancement of the GABA-gated current. Higher concentrations of NO also enhance GABA-gated currents, but this enhancement is primarily due to a substantial positive shift in the reversal potential of the current. Several pieces of evidence, including a similar effect on glycine-gated currents, indicate that the positive shift is due to an increase in cytosolic Cl-. This change in the chloride distribution is especially significant because it can invert the sign of GABA- and glycine-gated voltage responses. Furthermore, current- and voltage-clamp recordings from synaptic pairs of GABAergic amacrine cells demonstrate that NO transiently converts signaling at GABAergic synapses from inhibition to excitation. Persistence of the NO-induced shift in E(Cl-) in the absence of extracellular Cl- indicates that the increase in cytosolic Cl- is due to release of Cl- from an internal store. An NO-dependent release of Cl- from an internal store is also demonstrated for rat hippocampal neurons indicating that this mechanism is not restricted to the avian retina. Thus signaling in the CNS can be fundamentally altered by an NO-dependent mobilization of an internal Cl- store.",Excluded
2494,"Using superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetics to manipulate the redox environment of neural precursor cells Past work has shown that neural precursor cells are predisposed to redox sensitive changes, and that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the acute and persistent changes that occur within the irradiated CNS. Irradiation leads to a marked rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that correlates with oxidative endpoints in vivo and reductions in neurogenesis. To better understand the impact of oxidative stress on neural precursor cells, and to determine if radiation-induced oxidative damage and precursor cell loss after irradiation could be reduced, a series of antioxidant compounds (EUK-134, EUK-163, EUK-172, EUK-189) were tested, three of which possess both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and one (EUK-163) whose only significant activity is SOD. Our results show that these SOD/catalase mimetics apparently increase the oxidation of a ROS-sensitive fluorescent indicator dye, particularly after short (12 h) treatments, but that longer treatments (24 h) decrease oxidation attributable to radiation-induced ROS. Similarly, other studies found that cells incubated with CuZnSOD showed some increase in intracellular ROS levels. Subsequent data suggested that the dye-oxidising capabilities of the EUK compounds were linked to differences in their catalase activity and, most likely, their ability to catalyse peroxidative pathways. In unirradiated mice, the EUK-134 analogue induced some decrease of proliferating precursor cells and immature neurons 48 h after radiation, an effect that may be attributable to cytotoxicity and/or inhibition of precursor proliferation. In irradiated mice, a single injection of EUK-134 was not found to be an effective radioprotector at acute times (48 h). The present results support continued development of our in vitro model as a tool for predicting certain in vivo responses, and suggest that in some biological systems the capability to scavenge superoxide but produce excess H(2)O(2), as is known for CuZnSOD, may be potentially deleterious. Our results also show that the ability of catalase mimetics, like true catalases, to catalyse peroxidase reactions can complicate the interpretation of data obtained with certain fluorescent ROS-indicator dyes.",Included
2308,"[Pure motor neuropathy after radiation therapy: 6 cases] We report clinical and neurophysiological characteristics of six patients (five women and one man) presenting a pure motor bilateral asymmetric proximal and distal weakness in the setting of radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma in four cases, carcinoma of the uterus in one, and cancer of the ovary in one. Motor deficit, amyotrophy, cramps, fasciculations and tendinous areflexia were confined to the lower limbs in five patients and to the upper limbs in one. No sensory or sphincter disturbance was noted. The progression of the disease was slow with sometimes secondary stabilization. In some patients, CSF showed a slight increase in protein content with no cell. Blood and MRI medullary examination were normal. Delay between radiation therapy and onset of neurological symptoms range from 6 to 24 years (mean 15). Neurophysiological findings suggest ventral roots proximal conduction blocks. We found an increase F-waves latency, a complete distal palsy contrasting with persistent muscle action potential after distal stimulation, in most of the patients; and an evidence of a conduction block between the erb point and the cervical roots using magnetic stimulation in the patient with upper limbs involvement. Mechanisms and sites of nerve radiation injury remains still unclear. These data could indicate, as it was already reported, a proximal damage involving predominantly the motor roots.",Excluded
1739,"Vaccination of chicks against Plasmodium gallinaceum by erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic parasites attenuated by gamma irradiation Plasmodium gallinaceum-infected blood which received up to 24 krad during exposure to gamma-rays from a cobalt-60 source produced infections of normal course and duration when injected into chickens. The prepatent period advanced with increasing exposure of infected blood to radiation, suggesting some degree of attenuation. At 26, 28 and 30 krad, the infections were transient and the parasites were morphologically abnormal. It is thought that the amount of radiation required to render the parasites non-viable is about 45 krad for an inoculum of 10(6) parasites. There is evidence that exoerythrocytic stages may be more susceptible to gamma-rays than are blood parasites. Chickens were inoculated three times, over a period of four weeks, with vaccines prepared from gamma-irradiated infected blood and brain tissue. Half the birds which had been inoculated with attenuated parasitized blood exhibited mild infections during vaccination, and they were the only birds to show at challenge immunity to both homologous blood and exoerythrocytic parasites.",Included
1803,"(R)-roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, enhances tonic GABA inhibition in rat hippocampus Pharmacological agents that mediate a persistent GABAergic conductance are of considerable interest for treatment of epilepsy. (R)-roscovitine is a membrane permeable cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, designed to block cell division. It is currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial as an anticancer drug. We show that (R)-roscovitine increases a tonic GABA-mediated current in rat hippocampal neurons. This enhanced tonic current appears independent of synaptic GABA release and requires functional transmembrane GABA transport. The effect of (R)-roscovitine is associated with neither modification of GABAA receptors nor protein kinase activity, but is associated with a significant increase in intracellular GABA concentration in hippocampal GABAergic neurons. (R)-roscovitine-induced tonic inhibition significantly suppresses spontaneous spiking activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Therefore, (R)-roscovitine is a potent modulator of neuronal activity in rat hippocampus and may provide a tool for preventing paroxysmal activity.",Excluded

Ninety-six 45-day-old, 70 4-month-old, and 78 18-month-old male rats were divided in two equal groups: (i) irradiated and (ii) control. A course of whole-brain radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions over 12 days) was administered to the irradiated group, while the control group received sham irradiation. Sequential behavioral studies including one and two-way avoidance tests were undertaken before and after the 7 months following radiation. The results suggest that radiation induced progressive and irreversible memory dysfunction in elderly (18-month-old) rats, but this effect was partial or almost reversible in the 4-month-old and 45-day-old rats, respectively. In return, the learning dysfunction was age non-dependent despite the fact that is occurs more rapidly in the young (45 days, 4 months) rats.",Included
1215,"Therapeutic perspectives for brain metastases in non-oncogene addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Towards a less dismal future? Risk of brain metastases (BM) affects a remarkable number of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, impacting on their quality of life (QoL) and prognosis. While tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) showed interesting intracranial control rates in oncogene-addicted NSCLC, BM still represent an unmet need for the counterpart without driver gene mutations. For these patients, new treatment options include anti-angiogenic drugs and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, possibly combined with standard chemotherapy, even though the benefit on BM has not been clearly defined. A multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons, medical and radiation oncologists is needed in order to integrate systemic and loco-regional strategies at the right time point. Ad-hoc designed clinical trials are slowly emerging for previously treated patients with uncontrolled BM. The aim of this review is to offer a detailed and updated picture of possible approaches for non oncogene-addicted NSCLC patients having BM, in order to support clinicians in their daily practice.

The authors previously developed an image-based two-compartment method for BM dosimetry, showing a significant correlation between absorbed dose to BM and hematological toxicity in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE treatments. In the present study, they aimed to further evaluate this BM dosimetry method by finding optimal settings for dividing the whole body into two compartments; in terms of minimizing the coefficient of variation (CV) for the individual absorbed doses and studying its correlation to the BM response. The authors have also added specific absorbed fractions for male and female. Finally, they compare this two-compartment method with whole-body dosimetry.METHODS: This study included 46 patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE on two to five occasions at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Planar gamma camera images were collected at four time points postinjection, and a segmentation tool using a normalized number of uptake foci (nNUF) to divide the whole body into high- and low-uptake compartments was used. The authors characterized the two-compartment model and compared it with whole-body dosimetry.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The dosimetry method was robust, with an optimal nNUF value of 0.1-0.2. Using an nNUF value of 0.15, the absorbed BM dose was estimated as 0.20 Gy/7.4 GBq, and the CV as 8.4%. Compared to whole-body dosimetry, stronger correlation was found between absorbed dose to BM and hematological response using the two-compartment method.

1323,"Neuroendocrine asymmetry The information available at present clearly indicates that asymmetry exists from the level of elementary particles to the human cerebral cortex, the latest stage of evolution. Cerebral lateralization is one of the well-known asymmetries. This paper summarizes the data published in the past decades on the asymmetry of the neuroendocrine system. The information on the sided-differences between the gonads, adrenals, and thyroid lobes and that on the lateralization of hypothalamic, limbic, and other brain structures participating in the control of the endocrine glands as well as relevant clinical observations are reviewed here. The innervation of the peripheral endocrine glands is also briefly summarized because the afferent and efferent fibers of these glands may represent one part of the pathway involved in neuroendocrine asymmetry. The data reviewed clearly indicate that some kind of asymmetry (morphological, biochemical, physiological, pathological) is evident at different levels of the neuroendocrine system (at limbic, hypothalamic, peripheral endocrine glands and their innervation) and there are species, sex, and age differences. Most of the information accumulated deals with the CNS-gonadal system. A majority of the observations suggest that in both male and female rats there is a predominance of the right half of brain structures controlling gonadal function. The asymmetry, however, is not restricted to CNS structures: it also exists at the level of the gonads, including their innervation. It appears that the characteristic pattern of the CNS-gonadal system becomes fixed only after sexual maturation. Very few reports are available suggesting some kind of asymmetry of the CNS-adrenal cortex and the CNS-thyroid system. There are convincing findings consistent with the view that in addition to the hypothalamo-adenohypophyseal system acting via the general circulation on the peripheral endocrine glands, there is also a pure neural link between the CNS and the gonads, the CNS and the adrenal gland, and also between the CNS and the thyroid. This link contains afferent and efferent pathways and is able to modulate the functional activity or the responsiveness of the gland. It may also serve as a neural reflex arc. It is assumed that the neuroendocrine asymmetry expresses itself through (i) hypophysiotrophic neurohormones and hormones of the peripheral endocrine glands, (ii) neural pathways, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). The authors hope that this publication, in addition to providing an overview, will also stimulate research, both basic and clinical, in this exciting area of neuroendocrinology.

1697,"Reevaluation of near-infrared light propagation in the adult human head: implications for functional near-infrared spectroscopy Using both experimental and theoretical methods, we examine the contribution of different parts of the head to near-IR (NIR) signal. Time-resolved spectroscopy is employed to measure the mean optical path length (PL), and the absorption (mu(a)) and reduced scattering (mu(s)') coefficients in multiple positions of the human head. Monte Carlo simulations are performed on four-layered head models based on an individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to determine mu(a) and mu(s)' in each layer of the head by solving inverse problems, and to estimate the partial path length in the brain (p-PL) and the spatial sensitivity to regions in the brain at the source-detector separation of 30 mm. The PL is closely related to the thickness of the scalp, but not to that of other layers of the head. The p-PL is negatively related to the PL and its contribution ratio to the PL is 5 to 22% when the differential path length factor is 6. Most of the signal attributed to the brain comes from the upper 1 to 2 mm of the cortical surface. These results indicate that the NIR signal is very sensitive to hemodynamic changes associated with functional brain activation in the case that changes in the extracerebral tissue are ignorable.",Excluded

In this study, the effect of the ischemic neurodegeneration of the thoracic sympathetic nuclei (TSN) on the heart rate (HR) was examined following a spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SSAH).METHODS: This study was conducted on 22 rabbits. Five rabbits were used as a control group, five as SHAM, and twelve as a study group. The animals' HRs were recorded via monitoring devices on the first day, and those results were accepted as baseline values. The HRs were remeasured after injecting 0.5 cc of isotonic saline for SHAM and 0.5 cc of autolog arterial blood into the thoracic spinal subarachnoid space at T4-T5 for the study group. After a three-week follow-up with continuous monitoring of their HRs, the rabbit's thoracic spinal cords and stellate ganglia were extracted. The specimens were evaluated by histopathological methods. The densities of degenerated neurons in the TSN and stellate ganglia were compared with the HRs.RESULTS: The mean HRs and mean degenerated neuron density of the TSN and stellate ganglia in control group were 251+/-18/min, 5+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 3+/-1/mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of advanced imaging in patients with SAH, incorporating the risks of radiation exposure from CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The risks of radiation-induced brain cancer and cataracts were incorporated into our established decision model comparing the cost-effectiveness of CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging and transcranial Doppler sonography in SAH. Cancer risk was calculated by using National Cancer Institute methodology. The remaining input probabilities were based on literature data and a cohort at our institution. Outcomes were expected quality-adjusted life years gained, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging were the dominant strategies, resulting in both better health outcomes and lower costs, even when incorporating brain cancer and cataract risks. Our results remained robust in 2-way sensitivity analyses varying the prolonged latency period up to 30 years, with either brain cancer risk up to 50 times higher than the upper 95% CI limit or the probability of cataracts from 0 to 1. Results were consistent for scenarios that considered either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with SAH. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed our findings over a broad range of selected input parameters.CONCLUSIONS: While risks of radiation exposure represent an important consideration, CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging remained the preferred imaging compared with transcranial Doppler sonography in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SAH, with improved health outcomes and lower health care costs, even when modeling a significantly higher risk and shorter latency period for both cataract and brain cancer than that currently known.",Excluded

Patients were divided into two groups according to their treatment types. Fifty seven patients were treated with SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs, while another 57 patients were treated with WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs. The clinical efficacy, intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS), systemic progression-free survival (sPFS), overall survival (OS,) and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used for imaging evaluation in both groups and all patients underwent symptomatic treatment such as dehydration or hormone therapy according to the patient's condition. The efficacy was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1) and adverse reactions were assessed based on the criteria for toxic reaction of anti-cancer drugs of WHO.RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in general conditions between the two groups of patients. The median iPFS and median sPFS were similar between the two groups (12.2 months vs. 11.5 months and 10.7 months vs. 9.8 months respectively, p>0.05). The median OS of patients treated with SRS + EGFR-TKIs was significantly longer than in those treated with WBRT + EGFR-TKIs (25.1 months vs. 22.0 months, respectively, p=0.042). No statistically significant differences were found in the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), the incidence rates of cytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and liver dysfunction between the two groups (p>0.05). There were 8 cases with radiotherapy-associated grade 3 or higher brain damage in SRS + EGFR-TKIs group compared to 19 cases in those treated with WBRT + EGFR-TKIs, suggesting that the incidence rate of radiation-induced brain injuries in SRS + EGFR-TKIs group was remarkably lower than those in WBRT + EGFR-TKIs group (p=0.026).CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy of SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs is comparable to that of WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs in the treatment of NSCLC patients with <=3 brain metastases and EGFR-sensitive mutation and the OS of patients is longer, with lower toxic side effect and higher safety, hence SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs should be used as the preferred therapeutic regimen.",Excluded

1847,"Role of p53 in the regulation of irradiation-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells Wild-type p53 plays a crucial role in the control of apoptosis following ionizing radiation (IR); conversely, mutant p53 is associated with IR resistance. Although wild-type p53 is expressed in virtually all neuroblastoma tumors, treatment failures secondary to inadequate local control with radiotherapy are a problem in patients with advanced stage disease. This apparent paradox is the focus of our interest. The Shep-1 neuroblastoma cell line is highly resistant to IR. This cell line contains a wild-type p53 gene and is an ideal model for studying the mechanism of IR resistance in this disease. Following high-dose IR, cell fractionation demonstrated that p53 is induced and targeted to the nucleus. The induced p53 is functional as p53-responsive genes (Waf-1 and MDM-2) are appropriately induced following IR. Intriguingly, overexpression of p53 could reverse the inherent IR resistance of Shep-1 cells. Multiple cell lines expressing variable levels of exogenous temperature-sensitive p53 were generated. Pulse induction of p53 alone did not affect Shep-1 cell viability, while induction of p53, followed by IR, resulted in cell death and DNA fragmentation proportional to the dose of IR and the level of p53 expression. These findings demonstrate that p53 overexpression renders Shep-1 cells IR-sensitive and suggest that large quantities of exogenous p53 can overcome the factors inhibiting p53-mediated, IR-induced apoptosis.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: 33 patients with brain metastases were included in the study and treated with TMZ 60 mg/m2/day (days 1-16) concomitantly with WBI (36 Gy/12 fractions given in 16 days). One month after the end of radiotherapy, 6 cycles of TMZ were administered as adjuvant treatment (200 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days). Result(s): Responses were assessed using computed tomography at the end of the 3rd and 6th cycle of chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 54.5% and 57.6% after the 3rd and the 6th cycle, respectively. The median overall survival was 12 months. In patients with metastases from lung cancer the objective response rate was 11/14 (78.6%) after both the 3rd and the 6th cycle of treatment. The most common side effects were anemia (24.2%), thrombocytopenia (18.2%), as well as nausea and vomiting (18.2%). The high incidence of hepatotoxicity (45.5%) might be related to concomitantly administered antiepileptic drugs and not to TMZ.

Tests of standing and walking steadiness were administered along with cognitive and motor performance tests to Navy and Marine Corps aviators before and after their regular simulator training, resulting in records of 726 pilot exposure observations. When exposed pilots were compared to a control group who did not fly in a simulator, statistically significant decrements in postural equilibrium test scores were found for all of the moving base simulators, but for only one of the three fixed-base simulators. The size of these losses was approximately 15% of baseline. Cognitive and motor changes, while statistically significant, were complicated by learning effects in all groups for all tests. When compared to the control group, improvement in cognitive scores was always less in the simulator groups, but greater improvement occurred in the simulator groups for motor speed scores, although this latter difference was small (<1% of baseline). Further study of performance changes is recommended. In those simulators where significant effects occurred, the ataxia and the time- course of the disequilibrium should be followed.",Excluded

Larger tumors treated surgically often result in deafness and facial neuropathy. Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery was used in an effort to maintain effective therapy while minimizing toxicity of treatment.METHODS: The authors described 38 patients with acoustic neuromas, with age range 35-89 years (mean, 60 years). 2,000 cGy in divided weekly doses of 400 or 500 cGy was most commonly prescribed. Tumors > or = 3 cm (n = 16) received the 5 fraction schema. Mean tumor volume was 6.9 cm3, with range from 0.1 to 32.0 cm3.RESULTS: Median clinical follow-up was 27.1 months, while neuroimaging follow-up had a median of 16.3 months. All tumors were controlled. Of 23 tumors smaller than 3 cm, 14 (61%) decreased in size, and 9 showed cessation of growth. Thirteen of 16 (81%) large acoustic neuromas (3-5 cm) diminished in size. The remaining 3 showed cessation of growth. Median radiographic follow-up was 20 months, with a median clinical follow-up of 28 months.

Cell Tissue Res 297(3):467-473] and heat shock proteins have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders [Iwamoto K, Kakiuchi C, Bundo M, Ikeda K, Kato T (2004) Molecular characterization of bipolar disorder by comparing gene expression profiles of postmortem brains of major mental disorders.

Thus, the gene expression changes that we have observed here are consistent with and extend the observations found in the clinical literature and link them to the animal model used here thereby reinforcing its use to better understand the genesis of depression and identify novel therapeutic targets for its treatment.",Excluded
1836,"Monoplane 3D Overlay Roadmap versus Conventional Biplane 2D Roadmap Technique for Neurointervenional Procedures PURPOSE: We investigated whether a 3D overlay roadmap using monoplane fluoroscopy offers advantages over a conventional 2D roadmap using biplane fluoroscopy during endovascular aneurysm treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for 131 consecutive cerebral aneurysm embolizations by three neurointerventionalists at a single institution. Allowing for a transition period, the periods from January 2012 to August 2012 (Time Period 1) and February 2013 to July 2013 (Time Period 2) were analyzed for radiation exposure, contrast administration, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, angiographic results, and perioperative complications. Two neurointerventionalists (Group 1) used a conventional 2D roadmap for both Time Periods, and one neurointerventionalist (Group 2) transitioned from a 2D roadmap during Time Period 1 to a 3D overlay roadmap during Time Period 2.RESULTS: During Time Period 2, Group 2 demonstrated reduced fluoroscopy time (p<0.001), procedure time (P=0.023), total radiation dose (p=0.001), and fluoroscopy dose (P=0.017) relative to Group 1. During Time Period 2, there was no difference of immediate angiographic results and procedure complications between the two groups. Through the transition from Time Period 1 to Time Period 2, Group 2 demonstrated decreased fluoroscopy time (p< 0.001), procedure time (p=0.022), and procedure complication rate (p=0.041) in Time Period 2 relative to Time Period 1.CONCLUSION: The monoplane 3D overlay roadmap technique reduced fluoroscopy dose and fluoroscopy time during neurointervention of cerebral aneurysms with similar angiographic occlusions and complications rate relative to biplane 2D roadmap, which implies possible compensation of limitations of monoplane fluoroscopy by 3D overlay technique.",Excluded
1918,"Strategy and clinical results for intracranial nongerminomatous germ cell tumors induced intensive chemotherapy Purpose: It is well known that an intracranial non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCT), especially poor prognosis group which demonstrated high level of serum tumor marker has poor prognosis due to CSF dissemination or local recurrence. The objective of this study was to determine whether the combination of surgery and intensive chemotherapy was effective in patients with poor prognosis group of intracranial NGGCT. Patient(s): Since 1998, we have had 24 patients with an intracranial NGGCT. These consisted of an intermediate group (IG) with 10 cases, and a poor group (PG) with 14 cases. NAT (neo-adjuvant therapy), which is preceding chemotherapy before surgery, was performed in 11 cases which presented with serum b-HCG of over 500 mIU/ml or AFP 500 ng/ml and a reduced teratoma component in neuro-imagings. Radical surgery was done in another 13 cases. The chemotherapy regimen was CARE (carboplatin, etoposide) for IG. Since 2006, we have shifted the chemotherapy from ICE regimen (ifosfamide, cisplatin, etoposide) (8 cases) to the JCO2004 regimen (cisplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, carboplatin) (6 cases) to strengthen chemotherapy for PG followed by reduced dose of radiation. Result(s): The total follow-up period was 6.7 years. Two patients showed rapid tumor growth after chemotherapy in so called ""growing teratoma syndrome."" Four patients in NAT (40%) demonstrated complete remission after only chemotherapy. In PG, five of eight in ICE (62%) died (recurrence: 4, radiation induced glioblastoma: 1), none showed tumor recurrence in the JCO 2004 regimen. All patients in IG survived without tumor recurrence. The 3-year, 5-year and 10 year survival rate of PG was 68%, 68% and 51%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The strategy in combination with surgery and intensive chemotherapy based on neuro-imagings and level of serum tumor markers in patients with poor prognosis group of intracranial NGGCT were expected favorable prognosis.",Excluded
1331,"Determination of dosimetric perturbations caused by aneurysm clip in stereotactic radiosurgery using gel phantoms and EBT-Gafchromic films Some radiotherapy patients are treated with titanium surgical aneurysm clips in the radiation field. This is of particular importance for stereotactic radiosurgery brain treatments, where the length of the blade of the clip may be comparable to the size of the radiation field. This study seeks to determine the extent of the dosimetric effects caused by surgical clips in stereotactic radiosurgery, using polyacrylamide gel phantoms and EBT type Gafchromic films. Using gel phantoms scanned with magnetic resonance imaging scanner, dose enhancement of around 20% was noted at distances less than 2 mm away from the clip surface. Gafchromic films showed about 6% variations in the dose up to few millimeters from the clip. These experimental results confirmed results predicted by Monte Carlo simulation techniques for higher density material surgical clips such as lead and platinum. Moreover, these experimental measurements clearly indicate dose reduction due to radiation attenuation behind the clip of about 4%. Â© 2008 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded

1526,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide controls the suprachiasmatic circadian clock network via ERK1/2 and DUSP4 signalling The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) co-ordinates circadian behaviour and physiology in mammals. Its cell-autonomous circadian oscillations pivot around a well characterised transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL), whilst the SCN circuit as a whole is synchronised to solar time by its retinorecipient cells that express and release vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The cell-autonomous and circuit-level mechanisms whereby VIP synchronises the SCN are poorly understood. We show that SCN slices in organotypic culture demonstrate rapid and sustained circuit-level circadian responses to VIP that are mediated at a cell-autonomous level. This is accompanied by changes across a broad transcriptional network and by significant VIP-directed plasticity in the internal phasing of the cell-autonomous TTFL. Signalling via ERK1/2 and tuning by its negative regulator DUSP4 are critical elements of the VIP-directed circadian re-programming. In summary, we provide detailed mechanistic insight into VIP signal transduction in the SCN at the level of genes, cells and neural circuit.",Excluded
2304,"Clinical Characteristics and Associated Systemic Diseases in Patients with Esophageal ""absent Contractility"" - A Clinical Algorithm Goals: This study was carried out to assess the clinical characteristics and associated systemic diseases seen in patients diagnosed with absent contractility as per the Chicago Classification version 3.0, allowing us to propose a diagnostic algorithm for their etiologic testing. Background(s): The Chicago Classification version 3.0 has redefined major and minor esophageal motility disorders using high-resolution esophageal manometry. There is a dearth of publications based on research on absent contractility, which historically has been associated with myopathic processes such as systemic sclerosis (SSc). Study: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study. Data of patients diagnosed with absent contractility were pooled from Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH (January 2006 to July 2016) and Metrohealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH (July 2014 to July 2016) and included: age, gender, associated medical conditions, surgical history, medications, and specific antibody testing. Result(s): A total of 207 patients, including 57 male individuals and 150 female individuals, with mean age of 56.1 and 60.0 years, respectively, were included. Disease distribution was as follows: SSc (diffuse or limited cutaneous) 132, overlap syndromes 7, systemic lupus erythematosus17, Sjogren syndrome 4, polymyositis 3, and dermatomyositis 3. Various other etiologies including gastroesophageal reflux disease, postradiation esophagitis, neuromuscular disorders, and surgical complications were seen in the remaining cohort. Conclusion(s): Most practitioners use the term ""absent contractility"" interchangeably with ""scleroderma esophagus""; however, only 63% of patients with absent contractility had SSc. Overall, 20% had another systemic autoimmune rheumatologic disease and 16% had a nonrheumatologic etiology for absent contractility. Therefore, alternate diagnosis must be sought in these patients. We propose an algorithm for their etiologic evaluation. Copyright Â© 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1421,"Primary central nervous system lymphoma: Is there still a role for radiotherapy? Purpose of Review: Adding high-dose methotrexate to whole-brain radiotherapy improves survival in primary central nervous system lymphoma. However, the high neurotoxicity rates observed, especially in the elderly, raised interest in exploring other alternatives such as reduced-dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy-only treatments. Recent Findings: Phase II studies suggested that omitting radiotherapy decreases progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival. A randomized phase III trial testing chemotherapy with/without radiation found similar results. However, interpretation of that trial has been difficult because of the chemotherapy regimen used (methotrexate with/without ifosfamide), intrinsic methodological problems and lack of neuropsychological evaluation. It also remains unclear whether chemotherapy-only treatments could ultimately result in worse cognitive outcomes in comparison with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy because the higher rates of relapses could result in additional neurotoxicity from salvage treatments and brain damage by relapsing tumor. Given differences in relapses and neurotoxicity rates according to age, it is also unclear how results apply to younger versus older patients. Summary: Given the lack of better data, omitting radiotherapy currently seems a justifiable choice in routine practice, particularly in the elderly, but the question remains unsettled. Ongoing studies are investigating other consolidation options, including reduced-dose radiotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue, aiming at improving disease control and decreasing neurotoxicity.

1682,"Quality of life after palliative treatment for oesophageal carcinoma - A prospective comparison between stent placement and single dose brachytherapy Metal stent placement and single dose brachytherapy are commonly used treatment modalities for the palliation of inoperable oesophageal carcinoma. We investigated generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after these palliative treatments. Patients with dysphagia from inoperable oesophageal carcinoma were randomised to placement of a covered Ultraflex stent (n=108) or single dose (12 Gy) brachytherapy (n=101). We obtained longitudinal data on disease-specific (dysphagia score, European Organisation for Reasearch and Treament of Cancer (EORTC) OES-23, visual analogue pain scale) and generic (EORTC Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnarie (QLQ-C30), Euroqol (EQ)-5D) HRQoL at monthly home visits by a specially-trained research nurse. We compared HRQoL between the two treatments and analysed changes in HRQoL during follow-up. Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy, but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy. For generic HRQoL, there was an overall significant difference in favour of brachytherapy on four out of five functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (role, emotional, cognitive and social) (P<0.05). Generic HRQoL deteriorated over time on all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and EQ-5D, in particular physical and role functioning (on average -23 and -24 on a 100 points scale during 0.5 years of follow-up). This decline was more pronounced in the stent group. Major improvements were seen on the dysphagia and eating scales of the EORTC OES-23, in contrast to other scales of this disease-specific measure, which remained almost stable during follow-up. Reported levels of chest or abdominal pain remained stable during follow-up in both treatment groups, general pain levels increased to a minor extent. The effects of single dose brachytherapy on HRQoL compared favourably to those of stent placement for the palliation of oesophageal cancer. Future studies on palliative care for oesophageal cancer should at least include generic HRQoL scales, since these were more responsive in measuring patients' functioning and well-being during follow-up than disease-specific HRQoL scales.

2113,"Sensitization and habituation of AMH and C-fiber related percepts of repetitive radiant heat stimulation OBJECTIVE: Pain perception involves neuronal plasticity at peripheral and central stages, resulting in sensitization or habituation, depending on intensity and temporal features of stimulation. Concurrent assessment of perceptual change over different time spans is therefore important for understanding the dynamics of pain processing.METHODS: A new psychophysical procedure was established to assess sensitization and habituation during repetitive radiant heat stimulation. Short-term perceptual change (<1 min) during trials with 10 stimuli applied at 3 frequencies (0.2-0.6-1.8 Hz) and 3 intensities was assessed for AMH-II or C-fiber related percepts. Perceptual changes were monitored for medium-term (1-15 min) and for long-term (15-90 min) time spans.RESULTS: Short-term sensitization occurred only at frequencies above 0.3 Hz and was affected by both stimulus frequency and intensity, but the AMH-fiber related sensitization depended on intensity only above 0.6 Hz. Multiple stimulation of the same skin area during medium-term time spans resulted in habituation. No long-term perceptual changes occurred.CONCLUSIONS: The procedure permits concurrent assessment of short-term sensitization and medium-term habituation, assumed to be related to spinal windup and cutaneous nociceptive fiber fatigue, respectively.SIGNIFICANCE: The method is suitable for quantitative sensory testing of dynamic pain processing over different time spans, relevant in clinical testing of pain and in drug assessment.",Excluded

2391,"Assessment of treatment response of concurrent pulsed radiotherapy (PRT) and temozolomide by micropet/CT in a murine orthotopic model of glioblastoma multiforme Purpose/Objective: Glioblastomas (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors that are highly resistant to therapy. While conventional radiation therapy (RT) with temozolomide (TMZ) has improved median survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months, the majority of patients succumb to this disease due to local failure. To overcome this resistance, we evaluated the efficacy of pulsed low-dose radiotherapy (PRT) combined with TMZ as a novel treatment strategy, and evaluated efficacy using 18F-FDG muPET/CT imaging and immunohistochemistry. Materials/Methods: Intracranial tumors were established by injecting U87 GBM cells in Nu-Foxn1nu mice using a stereotactic device. Tumor burden was determined by contrast-enhanced muCT and these volumes were applied to 18F-FDG muPET data to evaluate tumor metabolic activity (SUVmax). Six treatment groups were evaluated; 1) control 2) TMZ alone 3) RT alone 4) PRT alone 5) RT+TMZ 6) PRT+TMZ. Tumors were irradiated 7-10 days post-implantation to a total dose of 14 Gy over 7 consecutive days. Radiation was delivered using either a single 2 Gy dose/day (RT) or 10 pulses of 0.2 Gy with an inter-pulse interval of 3 minutes (PRT), to the same total daily dose of 2 Gy. TMZ (10mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage 1 hr prior to daily RT or PRT treatment. At sacrifice, tumors were harvested for immunohistochemistry. Result(s): TMZ (10mg/kg) produced a modest growth delay of 2 weeks compared with controls (p<0.05). Compared to TMZ alone, combining TMZ with RT or PRT resulted in an additional 3-4 week growth delay (p<0.01). PRT+TMZ also resulted in a larger decline in SUVmax after treatment than RT+TMZ (p=0.01), but the SUVmax rebounded for each group during regrowth. Less normal brain damage, as assessed by Nissl staining, was seen after PRT+TMZ as compared with RT+TMZ (p<0.01). Levels of tumor apoptosis (TUNEL), proliferation (Ki67) and recruitment of CD45+/F4/80+ macrophages to the invasive tumor margins were similar for both the RT+TMZ and the PRT+TMZ treated groups. Significantly, CD45+/CD133+ bone marrow-derived cells were only seen in the hypoxic regions of tumors treated with TMZ alone or RT+/-TMZ, and not in tumors that that received PRT+/-TMZ. Conclusion(s): PRT+TMZ proved to be the most efficacious treatment, with diminished normal tissue side effects, as compared to the other treatment groups. Although the overall rate of tumor regrowth was similar after PRT+TMZ and RT+TMZ, PRT+TMZ produced a more effective initial response as determined by tumor volume and SUVmax. Interestingly, while normal tissue sparing with PRT was expected, the recruitment of the CD45+/CD133+ subpopulation of bone marrow-derived monocytic lineage cells to the hypoxic regions of other groups was unanticipated. These CD45+/CD133+ cells may ultimately be responsible for a microenvironment that causes faster regrowth. However, since the PRT-TMZ treated tumors regrew without CD45+/CD133+ cell recruitment, this suggests that there is an alternative pathway, and/or associated cell types, that are responsible for post-treatment tumor progression. This pathway may present an additional novel target for inhibition in multimodal treatment strategies for GBM.",Excluded

The pre-irradiation sensori-neural hearing threshold at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz was used as a baseline for the individual patient, and the observed sensori-neural hearing loss (SNHL) was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-irradiation values. The pre-irradiation hearing level or patient age was not correlated with the actual SNHL. In contrast, there was a significant correlation between the total radiation dose to the inner ear and the observed hearing impairment. SNHL was most pronounced in the high frequencies, with values up to 35 dB (4000 Hz) and 25 dB (2000 Hz) in some patients. The latent period for the complication appeared to be 12 months or more.

Results after heavy chemotherapy, total irradiation and autologous bone marrow transplantation. Fatal outcome. [French] A 35-year-old woman in the process of acute, nonlymphoblastic transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) was treated with heavy chemotherapy, total irradiation and autologous bone marrow transplantation. Chemotherapy included thioguanine 700 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, cytosine-arabinoside 700 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, cyclophosphamide 180 mg/kg and CCNU (lomustine) 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. This was followed by total irradiation in doses of 8 grays (screened to 6 grays for the lungs) at the rate of 19 rad/min. The autologous bone marrow reinjected had been taken 13 months before the transformation (8 days after the end of busulfan treatment) and frozen using a suboptimal program. Cytogenetically, the chronic phase of CML was characterized by a 46 XX Phi +/46 XX Phi - mosaic. During transformation, 3 clones were evaluated on 25 mitoses: 46 XX Phi - (7 mitoses); 46 XX Phi + (12 mitoses), and 47 XX Phi + with additional C (6 mitoses). The course of the disease after treatment was marked by: (1) disappearance of blast cells; (2) disappearance of the 47 XX Phi + population specific of transformation and of the 46 XX Phi + population. A single, normal 46 XX Phi - population remained 3 months after the bone marrow transplantation: (3) return to normal granulocyte production. However, thrombocytopenia persisted and resulted in death from cerebral haemorrhage on the 95th day. No residual blast cell infiltration was detected on post-mortem. This case shows that a massive treatment arrest acute transformation of CML. It also suggests that because busulfan had provided selective advantages or because the freezing program had been suboptimal, or both, engraftment with the 46 XX Phi -component of the initial mosaic was only partial and incomplete. Finally, it may serve as a model for the management of acute CML transformation using bone marrow autografts.",Excluded
1873,"The modulatory role of taurine in retinal ganglion cells Taurine (2-aminoethylsuphonic acid) is present in nearly all animal tissues, and is the most abundant free amino acid in muscle, heart, CNS, and retina. Although it is known to be a major cytoprotectant and essential for normal retinal development, its role in retinal neurotransmission and modulation is not well understood. We investigated the response of taurine in retinal ganglion cells, and its effect on synaptic transmission between ganglion cells and their presynaptic neurons. We find that taurine-elicited currents in ganglion cells could be fully blocked by both strychnine and SR95531, glycine and GABA(A) receptor antagonists, respectively. This suggests that taurine-activated receptors might share the antagonists with GABA and glycine receptors. The effect of taurine at micromolar concentrations can effectively suppress spontaneous vesicle release from the presynaptic neurons, but had limited effects on light-evoked synaptic signals in ganglion cells. We also describe a metabotropic effect of taurine in the suppression of light-evoked response in ganglion cells.

Effects of ionizing radiation and amifostine on embryonic viability and development The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a popular vertebrate model system for cancer and treatment-related research. Benefits include ease of care, rapid development, optical clarity of embryos, which allows visualization of major organ systems, and opportunities for genetic manipulation. However, specific parameters of radiation sensitivity have not been systematically documented. We investigated the effects of radiation and a radiomodifier on zebrafish viability and embryonic development. Embryos were exposed to gamma-radiation (5, 10, or 20 Gy) at sequential times postfertilization and serially assessed for viability and morphologic abnormalities. As expected, lethality and morphologic perturbations were more pronounced earlier in embryogenesis and with higher radiation doses and were partially reversed by amifostine. The effects of radiation and concurrent treatment with amifostine on the developmental organization of the eye and brain were striking. Radiation resulted in hypocellularity and disorganization of the cellular layers of the retina, effects partially reversed by amifostine, as well as lens opacification. Radiation strikingly reduced the volume of brain, but the volume loss was substantially blocked by amifostine. Increased terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling signal was noted in both the irradiated eye and brain, but reduced by amifostine. Finally, irradiating embryos resulted in caspase activation detectable in 96-well microplates, which was proportional to the number of embryos and radiation dose; the degree of activation was markedly reduced by amifostine.

Understanding cognition as it relates to environmental conditions, we use 4E cognition as a framework to explore creativity in extreme environments. Our paper examines space arts as a case study through the history, present practices, and future possible arts in the context of humans beyond the Karman boundary of the Earth's atmosphere. We develop a proposed taxonomy of space arts, based on prior taxonomies, and provide specific exemplars of space art developed by artists in space or for use by astronauts in space. Using examples of space art since the birth of the space age, we discuss (1) how human survival in extreme environments requires investment in the space arts, driven by consideration of various biopsychosocial factors and (2) how new scientific and engineering discoveries; such as the detection of air current patterns with paper airplanes in zero gravity, could be consequences or examples of creative thinking driven by artists in the various types of space art. We conclude by discussing possible benefits of space art, future research applications, and advocate that all space actors, government or private, involve artists in all projects beyond the Karman Boundary of the Earth's atmosphere.",Excluded
2092,"Model-based calculation of thyroid gland normal tissue complication probability in head and neck cancer patients after radiation therapy AIM: Primary hypothyroidism is one of the late complications that can occur after radiation therapy for malignant tumors in the head and neck region. The aim of this retrospective study was to show the validity of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication model for thyroid gland based on clinical results.METHODS: Thyroid function was evaluated by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine serum levels before radiation therapy, 3 months after the beginning of radiation therapy, and afterwards at each follow-up visit. Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Dose-volume histogram, total dose, fractionation schedule, total duration of the treatment, and other parameters were used for normal tissue complication probability calculation based on the LKB model. The model was evaluated after fitting with the three sets of parameters for grade 2 hypothyroidism: 1) ""Emami,"" where n= 0.22; m= 0.26, and D<sub>50</sub>= 80Gy; 2) ""mean dose,"" where n= 1; m= 0.27, and D<sub>50</sub>= 60Gy; and 3) ""Lyman EUD,"" where n= 0.49; m= 0.24, and D<sub>50</sub>= 60Gy. A value 3.0Gy was used for alpha/beta ratio RESULTS: Eighty-three patients treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy for head and neck cancers at the University Hospital Martin, Slovakia, from January 2014 to July 2017, were included in the retrospective study. Median follow-up was 1.2 years. Cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism grade 2 or higher after 12 and 24 months was 9.6 and 22.0%, respectively. Normal tissue complication probability values calculated with mean dose and Lyman EUD parameters showed the best correlation with our clinical findings.CONCLUSION: Empirically based modelling of normal tissue complication probability was valid for our cohort of patients. With carefully chosen parameters, the LKB model can be used for predicting the normal tissue complication probability value.",Excluded
1687,"Pharmacokinetics of the potent hallucinogen, salvinorin A in primates parallels the rapid onset and short duration of effects in humans Salvia divinorum, a mint plant originally used by the Mazatecs of Oaxaca, Mexico in spiritual rituals has gained popularity, in smoked form, as a legal hallucinogen in the United States and Europe. Abuse results in rapid onset and short-lasting effects that include visual hallucinations and motor-function impairment. Salvinorin A, the psychoactive component of S. divinorum, is a uniquely potent agonist at kappa-opioid receptors, targets for new therapeutic drugs. We labeled salvinorin A with C-11 by acylation of salvinorin B with [11C]-acetyl chloride to study whether its kinetic behavior in the brain parallels its uniquely fast, yet brief physiological effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies performed in 6 adult female baboons indicated extremely rapid brain uptake reaching a peak accounting for 3.3% of the total administered dose in 40 s and clearing with a half-life of 8 min. [11C]-salvinorin A was distributed throughout the brain with the highest concentration in the cerebellum and a notable concentration in the visual cortex, perhaps accounting for its physiological effects when smoked. Naloxone administration did not reduce the overall concentration of [11C]-salvinorin A significantly nor did it change its regional distribution. Peripheral organ kinetics suggested at least two modes of metabolism and excretion occur: through the renal and biliary systems. Our findings have revealed that the exceptionally rapid uptake and brief duration of salvinorin A in the brain match the time-course of visual hallucinations for S. divinorum when smoked. The effects of salvinorin A may occur at <10 mug in the human brain, emphasizing its remarkable potency.",Excluded
2315,"Comparison of internal dosimetry factors for three classes of adult computational phantoms with emphasis on I-131 in the thyroid The S values for 11 major target organs for I-131 in the thyroid were compared for three classes of adult computational human phantoms: stylized, voxel and hybrid phantoms. In addition, we compared specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) with the thyroid as a source region over a broader photon energy range than the x- and gamma-rays of I-131. The S and SAF values were calculated for the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference voxel phantoms and the University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms by using the Monte Carlo transport method, while the S and SAF values for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) stylized phantoms were obtained from earlier publications. Phantoms in our calculations were for adults of both genders. The 11 target organs and tissues that were selected for the comparison of S values are brain, breast, stomach wall, small intestine wall, colon wall, heart wall, pancreas, salivary glands, thyroid, lungs and active marrow for I-131 and thyroid as a source region. The comparisons showed, in general, an underestimation of S values reported for the stylized phantoms compared to the values based on the ICRP voxel and UF hybrid phantoms and relatively good agreement between the S values obtained for the ICRP and UF phantoms. Substantial differences were observed for some organs between the three types of phantoms. For example, the small intestine wall of ICRP male phantom and heart wall of ICRP female phantom showed up to eightfold and fourfold greater S values, respectively, compared to the reported values for the ORNL phantoms. UF male and female phantoms also showed significant differences compared to the ORNL phantom, 4.0-fold greater for the small intestine wall and 3.3-fold greater for the heart wall. In our method, we directly calculated the S values without using the SAFs as commonly done. Hence, we sought to confirm the differences observed in our S values by comparing the SAFs among the phantoms with the thyroid as a source region for selected target organs--small intestine wall, lungs, pancreas and breast--as well as illustrate differences in energy deposition across the energy range (12 photon energies from 0.01 to 4 MeV). Differences were found in the SAFs between phantoms in a similar manner as the differences observed in S values but with larger differences at lower photon energies. To investigate the differences observed in the S and SAF values, the chord length distributions (CLDs) were computed for the selected source--target pairs and compared across the phantoms. As demonstrated by the CLDs, we found that the differences between phantoms in those factors used in internal dosimetry were governed to a significant degree by inter-organ distances which are a function of organ shape as well as organ location.",Excluded
1828,"Toward Improving Patients' Experiences of Acute Toxicity From Breast Radiotherapy: Insights From the Analysis of Patient-Reported Outcomes in a Large Multicenter Cohort PURPOSE: Understanding acute toxicities after whole-breast radiotherapy is important to inform patients, guide treatment decisions, and target supportive care. We evaluated patient-reported outcomes prospectively collected from a cohort of patients with breast cancer.METHODS: We describe the maximal toxicity reported by 8,711 patients treated between 2012 and 2019 at 27 practices. Multivariable models identified characteristics associated with (1) breast pain, (2) bother from itching, stinging/burning, swelling, or hurting of the treated breast, and (3) fatigue within 7 days of completing whole-breast radiotherapy.RESULTS: Moderate or severe breast pain was reported by 3,233 (37.1%): 1,282 (28.9%) of those receiving hypofractionation and 1,951 (45.7%) of those receiving conventional fractionation. Frequent bother from at least one breast symptom was reported by 4,424 (50.8%): 1,833 (41.3%) after hypofractionation and 2,591 (60.7%) after conventional fractionation. Severe fatigue was reported by 2,008 (23.1%): 843 (19.0%) after hypofractionation and 1,165 (27.3%) after conventional fractionation. Among patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy, younger age (P < .001), higher body mass index (BMI; P < .001), Black (P < .001) or other race (P = .002), smoking status (P < .001), larger breast volume (P = .002), lack of chemotherapy receipt (P = .004), receipt of boost treatment (P < .001), and treatment at a nonteaching center predicted breast pain. Among patients receiving conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, younger age (P < .001), higher BMI (P = .003), Black (P < .001) or other race (P = .002), diabetes (P = .001), smoking status (P < .001), and larger breast volume (P < .001) predicted breast pain.CONCLUSION: In this large observational data set, substantial differences existed according to radiotherapy dose fractionation. Race-related differences in pain existed despite controlling for multiple other factors; additional research is needed to understand what drives these differences to target potentially modifiable factors. Intensifying supportive care may be appropriate for subgroups identified as being vulnerable to greater toxicity.",Excluded
1399,"Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Functional Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta) Activity and Benefit of TGFbeta Inhibition in Irradiated Intracranial Tumors Purpose: Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) promotes cell survival by endorsing DNA damage repair and mediates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, TGFbeta activation in response to radiation therapy is potentially targetable because it opposes therapeutic control. Strategies to assess this potential in the clinic are needed. Methods and Materials: We evaluated positron emission tomography (PET) to image <sup>89</sup>Zr -fresolimumab, a humanized TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, as a means to detect TGFbeta activation in intracranial tumor models. Pathway activity of TGFbeta was validated by immunodetection of phosphorylated SMAD2 and the TGFbeta target, tenascin. The contribution of TGFbeta to radiation response was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of mice bearing intracranial murine tumor models GL261 and SB28 glioblastoma and brain-adapted 4T1 breast cancer (4T1-BrA) treated with TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 1D11, and/or focal radiation (10 Gy). Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detected engineered, physiological, and radiation-induced TGFbeta activation, which was confirmed by immunostaining of biological markers. GL261 glioblastoma tumors had a greater PET signal compared with similar-sized SB28 glioblastoma tumors, whereas the widespread PET signal of 4T1-BrA intracranial tumors was consistent with their highly dispersed histologic distribution. Survival of mice bearing intracranial tumors treated with 1D11 neutralizing antibody alone was similar to that of mice treated with control antibody, whereas 1D11 improved survival when given in combination with focal radiation. The extent of survival benefit of a combination of radiation and 1D11 was associated with the degree of TGFbeta activity detected by PET. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detects radiation-induced TGFbeta activation in tumors. Functional imaging indicated a range of TGFbeta activity in intracranial tumors, but TGFbeta blockade provided survival benefit only in the context of radiation treatment. This study provides further evidence that radiation-induced TGFbeta activity opposes therapeutic response to radiation. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1745,"Electrophysiological characterisation of central sensitisation in canine spontaneous osteoarthritis In man, central sensitisation (CS) contributes to the pain of osteoarthritis (OA). Dogs with spontaneous OA may also exhibit CS. Electrophysiological reflex measurements are more objective than behavioural assessments and can be used to evaluate CS in preclinical and clinical studies. It was hypothesised that dogs suffering from OA would exhibit electrophysiological characteristics indicative of CS, associated with reduced diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNICs). One hundred and seventeen client-owned dogs were recruited to the study. Hind limb nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds, stimulus response, and temporal summation characteristics were recorded, during alfaxalone anaesthesia, from 46 OA dogs, 29 OA dogs receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OANSAIDs), and 27 breed- and weight-matched control dogs. Efficacy of DNIC was evaluated in 12 control and 11 of the OA dogs, by application of a mechanical conditioning stimulus to the contralateral forelimb. Nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds were higher in OA compared with control dogs (P = 0.02). Stimulus response characteristics demonstrated an augmented response in OANSAID dogs compared with OA (P < 0.001) and control (P < 0.001) dogs. Temporal summation demonstrated exaggerated C-fibre-mediated responses in both OA (P < 0.001) and OANSAID (P = 0.005) groups, compared with control animals. Conditioning stimulus application resulted in inhibition of test reflex responses in both OA and control animals (P < 0.001); control animals demonstrated greater inhibition compared with OA (P = 0.0499). These data provide evidence of neurophysiological changes consistent with CS in dogs with spontaneous OA and demonstrate that canine OA is associated with reduced DNIC.",Excluded

2393,"Clinical and histopathologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) after stereotactic radiosurgery OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma entails uncertain long-term risk of tumor recurrence and delayed cranial neuropathies. In addition, the underlying histopathologic changes to the tumor bed are not fully characterized. We seek to understand the clinical and histologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma after stereotactic radiation therapy.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Four patients who underwent microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannoma after primary stereotactic radiation therapy.INTERVENTION: Patients were treated primarily with gamma knife radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy followed by salvage microsurgery. Retrosigmoid craniotomy was used in all cases.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histopathologic review. Preoperative and postoperative facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann scale.RESULTS: We observed highly inconsistent radiation changes in the cerebellopontine angle and internal auditory canal. Fibrosis outside and within the tumor bed varied markedly, complicating microsurgical dissection. Light microscopy confirmed the presence of viable tumor in all cases. Histopathologic features were typical of vestibular schwannoma, and there was no significant scarring that could be attributed to radiation effect.CONCLUSIONS: The variable fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle and lack of radiation changes seen histopathologically in irradiated vestibular schwannoma suggest that a uniform treatment effect was not achieved in these cases. Although all four patients with preoperative cranial neuropathies were found intraoperatively to have fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle, excellent preservation of facial nerve anatomy and function was possible with salvage microsurgical resection. Additional analyses are needed to clarify the histopathologic and molecular characteristics associated with vestibular schwannoma growth after stereotactic radiation. [References: 58]",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to test the accuracy of the short-inhalation technique for estimating OEF in healthy human volunteers. Method(s): The final study population included 16 healthy volunteers, who underwent a series of dynamic PET scans consisting of short inhalation of <sup>15</sup>O-CO, short inhalation of <sup>15</sup>O-O <inf>2</inf>, and a bolus infusion of <sup>15</sup>O-H<inf>2</inf>O to generate parametric images for cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), OEF, and metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<inf>2</inf>). About 45 min before PET emission scanning, arterial and jugular blood was sampled through a catheter inserted in a radial artery and the right jugular bulb, respectively. PET-derived OEF (OEFpet) of the whole brain was compared with OEF calculated from the arteriovenous blood-sampling technique (OEFav). Result(s): Whole-brain-averaged CBF (mean +/- SD) measured with PET was 0.40 +/- 0.06 (range, 0.30-0.55) mL/g/min, CBV was 0.05 +/- 0.01 (range, 0.04-0.09) mL/g, CMRO<inf>2</inf> was 2.85 +/- 0.39 (range, 2.35-3.84) mL/100 g/min, and OEFpet was 0.39 +/- 0.06 (range, 0.30-0.51). OEFpet showed a slightly higher value than did OEFav (0.36 +/- 0.05 [range, 0.29-0.46]), but the difference was not significant. The difference in the 2 measurements (OEFpet - OEFav) did not correlate with CBF (r = -0.16; P = not statistically significant [NS]), CBV (r = -0.20; P = NS), CMRO<inf>2</inf> (r = -0.16; P = NS), partial arterial oxygen pressure (r = 0.29; P = NS) or partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (r = -0.17; P = NS).

2390,"A calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance underlies the plateau potential in rat substantia nigra GABAergic neurons Plateau potentials can be elicited in nigral GABAergic neurons by injection of 500 ms depolarizing current pulses from hyperpolarized holding potentials in whole-cell recordings in vitro. In approximately one-third of these neurons, plateau potentials were observed under control conditions and could be elicited in the remaining neurons after blocking potassium conductances. Application of the L-type calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 or activation of NMDA receptors enhanced plateau potentials observed under control conditions and caused a plateau to be elicited in neurons not exhibiting it previously. The plateau potential was abolished in calcium-free buffer, as well as by nickel or cadmium. The L-type calcium channel blockers nimodipine and nifedipine abolished the plateau potential observed under control conditions but did not affect plateaus unmasked by tetraethylammonium. Plateau potentials observed under control conditions as well as those observed in the presence of Bay K 8644, NMDA, or tetraethylammonium were abolished in low-sodium buffer and by the calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance blocker flufenamic acid. These data suggest that nigral plateau potentials are mediated by a calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance (I(CAN)) that is activated by calcium entry predominantly through L-type calcium channels. In many nigral neurons, I(CAN) is masked by tetraethylammonium-sensitive potassium conductances, but plateaus can be evoked after increasing calcium conductances. The I(CAN)-mediated plateau potential in nigral GABAergic neurons likely affects the way these neurons integrate input and may represent a mechanism contributing to the rhythmic firing of these neurons seen in pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.",Excluded

However, little is known about the involvement of neural tracts following HI-BI. We investigated neural tract injuries in adult patients with HI-BI, using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Twelve consecutive patients with HI-BI and 12 control subjects were recruited for this study. We classified the patients into two subgroups according to the preservation of alertness: subgroup A-5 patients who had intact alertness and subgroup B-7 patients who had impaired alertness. DTI-Studio software was used for evaluation of seven neural tracts: corticospinal, cingulum, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and optic radiation. We measured the DTT parameters (fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient and voxel number) of each neural tract. In the individual analysis, all 12 patients showed injuries in all 24 neural tracts in terms of both DTT parameters and integrity, except for the corticospinal tract (75.0% injury). In the group analysis, the patient group showed neural injuries in all 24 neural tracts. In comparison of subgroups A and B, subgroup B showed more severe injuries: subgroup B showed a higher rate of disruption (39.8%) than subgroup A (12.9%) on individual DTTs and subgroup B had more severe injuries in both the cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. In conclusion, we found that extensive injuries in the neural tracts were accompanied by HI-BI. Patients with impaired alertness appeared to show more severe injuries of neural tracts.

Pain originating from skeletal metastases is the most common form of cancer-related pain. Bone pain, often exacerbated by pressure or movement, limits the patient's autonomy and social life. Pain palliation with bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals has proven to be an effective treatment modality in patients with metastatic bone pain. These bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals are extremely powerful in treating scattered painful bone metastases, for which external beam radiotherapy is impossible because of the large field of irradiation. (186)Re-hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (HEDP) is a potentially useful radiopharmaceutical for this purpose, having numerous advantageous characteristics. Bone marrow toxicity is limited and reversible, which makes repetitive treatment safe. Studies have shown encouraging clinical results of palliative therapy using (186)Re-HEDP, with an overall response rate of ca. 70% in painful bone metastases. It is effective for fast palliation of painful bone metastases from various tumours and the effect tends to last longer if patients are treated early in the course of their disease. (186)Re-HEDP is at least as effective in breast cancer patients with painful bone metastases as in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. It is to be preferred to radiopharmaceuticals with a long physical half-life in this group of patients, who tend to have more extensive haematological toxicity since they have frequently been pretreated with bone marrow suppressive chemotherapy. This systemic form of radionuclide therapy is simple to administer and complements other treatment options. It has been associated with marked pain reduction, improved mobility in many patients, reduced dependence on analgesics, and improved performance status and quality of life.

1216,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment for epilepsy: can it also improve depression and vice versa? Comorbidity with depression is an important determinant of the quality of life for patients with epilepsy. Antidepressant medications can effectively treat depression in epileptic patients, but drug-drug interactions and epileptogenic effects of these drugs pose therapeutic challenges. The mood-stabilizing effects of antiepileptic medications may not be sufficient to treat depression. Therefore, treatments that alleviate the burden of depression without increasing seizure risk or, better yet, with the possibility of improving seizure control are worth exploring. Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, are providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of depression in epilepsy. For example, there appears to be prominent brain prefrontal hypoactivity, which may be sustained by the hyperactivity of the seizure focus. If so, neuromodulatory approaches that suppress epileptic focus hyperactivity and concurrently enhance prefrontal activity may be ideally suited. Indeed, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to yield simultaneous antiseizure and mood effects. Another neuromodulatory technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), can also modulate brain activity, but in a noninvasive, painless, and focal manner. Depending on the stimulation parameters, it is possible to enhance or reduce activity in the targeted brain region. Furthermore, TMS has been shown to be effective in treating depression, and preliminary data suggest that this treatment may also be effective for epilepsy treatment. This article reviews these data and explores further the question of whether depression and epilepsy can be simultaneously treated with TMS for optimal therapeutic impact. [References: 88]",Excluded
1541,"Skin fibroblast cell lines derived from non-Hodgkin's-lymphoma (NHL) patients show increased sensitivity to chronic gamma irradiation Cultured fibroblast cells from 19 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 3 patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), 3 AT heterozygotes and 11 (presumed) normal subjects were studied for impaired colony-forming ability after chronic gamma irradiation. Five cell lines from the NHL patients were also examined for the sensitivity to acute gamma irradiation, as compared with those of normal subjects. To ascertain the degree of radiosensitivity of different cell lines, a comparison was made of the D10 values (radiation dose resulting in 10% survival) for each cell line, estimated ""by eye"" from the actual survival curves, and also from the calculated curves fitted to a log-linear model. It was observed that the acute gamma irradiation failed to show any appreciable difference in the radiation response of the cell lines from NHL patients as compared with those of normal subjects. However, chronic irradiation demonstrated significantly increased radiosensitivity in at least 10-12 NHL patients with a p value of less than 0.05, when the D10 values of each patient's cell line were compared with the calculated composite values for the normals. When the D10 values of the NHL patients and the normal subjects were compared as 2 groups, the former appeared to be significantly more sensitive to chronic gamma irradiation (p less than 0.0001). The same level of significant difference in radiosensitivity was found between the 2 groups when their D37 values (radiation dose resulting in 37% survival) were compared. In general, the radiation response of the NHL patients was similar to that of the AT homozygotes and heterozygotes used as a positive control group. Our data thus show that increased radiosensitivity is associated with the NHL patients studied, indicating an underlying abnormality of their DNA repair.",Excluded

While reports suggest that HyperArc, a new stereotactic radiosurgery planning technique applied to non-coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique, is associated with high conformity and rapid dose fall-off, the performance of HyperArc for total scalp irradiation has not been explored. The current study aimed to compare the dosimetric performance of HyperArc plans with those of non-coplanar VMAT plans in angiosarcoma of the scalp.METHODS: Ten patients with angiosarcoma of the scalp were included in this study. The performance of three different plans administered using TrueBeam Edge were compared: non-coplanar VMAT using flattening filter (FF) beams (VMAT-FF), HyperArc using FF beams (HyperArc-FF), and HyperArc using flattening filter free (FFF) beams (HyperArc-FFF). The dose distribution, dosimetric parameters, and dosimetric accuracy for each of these plans were evaluated.RESULTS: The three plans showed no statistically significant differences in target volume coverage, conformity, and homogeneity. The HyperArc-FF and HyperArc-FFF plans provided significantly lower mean brain doses (12.63 +/- 3.31 Gy and 12.71 +/- 3.40 Gy) than did the VMAT-FF plans (17.11 +/- 5.25 Gy). There were almost no differences in sparing the organs at risk between the HyperArc-FF and HyperArc-FFF plans. The HyperArc-FF and HyperArc-FFF plans provided a shorter beam-on time than did the VMAT-FF plan. The 3%/2 mm gamma test pass rates were above 95% for all three plans.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the HyperArc plan can be potentially used for radiation therapy of target regions with large and complicated shapes, such as the scalp, and that there are no advantages of using FFF beams.",Excluded
1733,"Structure of docosahexaenoic acid-containing phospholipid bilayers as studied by (2)H NMR and molecular dynamics simulations Polyunsaturated phospholipids are known to be important with regard to the biological functions of essential fatty acids, for example, involving neural tissues such as the brain and retina. Here we have employed two complementary structural methods for the study of polyunsaturated bilayer lipids, viz. deuterium ((2)H) NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. Our research constitutes one of the first applications of all-atom MD simulations to polyunsaturated lipids containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 cis-Delta(4,7,10,13,16,19)). Structural features of the highly unsaturated, mixed-chain phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PDPC), have been studied in the liquid-crystalline (L(alpha)) state and compared to the less unsaturated homolog, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC). The (2)H NMR spectra of polyunsaturated bilayers are dramatically different from those of less unsaturated phospholipid bilayers. We show how use of MD simulations can aid in interpreting the complex (2)H NMR spectra of polyunsaturated bilayers, in conjunction with electron density profiles determined from small-angle X-ray diffraction studies. This work clearly demonstrates preferred helical and angle-iron conformations of the polyunsaturated chains in liquid-crystalline bilayers, which favor chain extension while maintaining bilayer flexibility. The presence of relatively long, extended fatty acyl chains may be important for solvating the hydrophobic surfaces of integral membrane proteins, such as rhodopsin. In addition, the polyallylic DHA chains have a tendency to adopt back-bended (hairpin-like) structures, which increase the interfacial area per lipid. Finally, the material properties have been analyzed in terms of the response of the bilayer to mechanical stress. Simulated bilayers of phospholipids containing docosahexaenoic acid were less sensitive to the applied surface tension than were saturated phospholipids, possibly implying a decrease in membrane elasticity (area elastic modulus, bending rigidity). The above features distinguish DHA-containing lipids from saturated or monounsaturated lipids and may be important for their biological modes of action.",Excluded

All lesions were localized in the body of the lateral ventricle, in one case in the anterior horn, in another case in the central part of the lateral ventricle and in two cases in the posterior horn and the trigone. In the remaining two cases the tumor was found in the body of the inferior horn. The 2 patients who underwent surgery had the GBM localized in the posterior and the inferior horn and a parietooccipital approach over the trigone was used. Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy followed in 4 patients. Conclusion Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary brain tumor, but the intraventricular localization is very rare and has a rather poor prognosis due to the fact, that gross total resection mostly can not be achieved. Surgical removal might be attempted only if subtotal resection can be achieved.",Excluded
2553,"Compromised quality of life in adult patients who have received a radiation dose towards the basal part of the brain. A case-control study in long-term survivors from cancer in the head and neck region BACKGROUND: Adult patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disorders have compromised quality of life (QoL). Whether this is due to their endocrine consequences (hypopituitarism), their underlying hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or both is still under debate. The aim of this trial was to measure quality of life (QoL) in long-term cancer survivors who have received a radiation dose to the basal part of the brain and the pituitary.METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=101) treated for oropharyngeal or epipharyngeal cancer with radiotherapy followed free of cancer for a period of 4 to10 years were identified. Fifteen patients (median age 56 years) with no concomitant illness and no hypopituitarism after careful endocrine evaluation were included in a case-control study with matched healthy controls. Doses to the hypothalamic-pituitary region were calculated. QoL was assessed using the Symptom check list (SCL)-90, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and Psychological Well Being (PGWB) questionnaires. Level of physical activity was assessed using the Baecke questionnaire.RESULTS: The median accumulated dose was 1.9 Gy (1.5-2.2 Gy) to the hypothalamus and 2.4 Gy (1.8-3.3 Gy) to the pituitary gland in patients with oropharyngeal cancer and 6.0-9.3 Gy and 33.5-46.1 Gy, respectively in patients with epipharyngeal cancer (n=2). The patients showed significantly more anxiety and depressiveness, and lower vitality, than their matched controls.CONCLUSION: In a group of long time survivors of head and neck cancer who hade received a low radiation dose to the hypothalamic-pituitary region and who had no endocrine consequences of disease or its treatment QoL was compromised as compared with well matched healthy controls.",Included
2352,"Measurement of craniovertebral angle with Electronic Head Posture Instrument: Criterion validity This study evaluated the criterion-related validity of the Electronic Head Posture Instrument (EHPI) in measuring the craniovertebral (CV) angle by correlating the measurements of CV angle with anterior head translation (AHT) in lateral cervical radiographs. It also investigated the correlation of AHT and CV angle with the Chinese version of the Northwick Park Questionnaire (NPQ) and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Thirty patients with diagnosis of mechanical neck pain for at least 3 months without referred symptoms were recruited in an outpatient physiotherapy clinic. The results showed that AHT measured with X-ray correlated negatively with CV angle measured with EHPI (r = -0.71, p < 0.001). CV angle also correlated negatively with NPQ (r = -0.67, p < 0.001) and NPRS (r = -0.70, p < 0.001), while AHT positively correlated with NPQ (r = 0.390, p = 0.033) and NPRS (r = 0.49, p = 0.006). We found a negative correlation between CV angle measured with the EHPI and AHT measured with the X-ray lateral film as well as with NPQ and NPRS in patients with chronic mechanical neck pain. EHPI is a valid tool in clinically assessing and evaluating cervical posture of patients with chronic mechanical neck pain.",Excluded
2302,"Acute exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field increases DNA strand breaks in rat brain cells Acute (2 h) exposure of rats to a 60 Hz magnetic field (flux densities 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mT) caused a dose-dependent increase in DNA strand breaks in brain cells of the animals (assayed by a microgel electrophoresis method at 4 h postexposure). An increase in single-strand DNA breaks was observed after exposure to magnetic fields of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mT, whereas an increase in double-strand DNA breaks was observed at 0.25 and 0.5 mT. Because DNA strand breaks may affect cellular functions, lead to carcinogenesis and cell death, and be related to onset of neurodegenerative diseases, our data may have important implications for the possible health effects of exposure to 60 Hz magnetic fields.",Excluded
1482,"Treatment of Asymptomatic Meningioma with Gamma Knife Radiosurgery: Long-Term Follow-up with Volumetric Assessment and Clinical Outcome BACKGROUND: Some patients are diagnosed with asymptomatic meningioma(s) after undergoing a screening CT and MRI for minor ailments or postresection. OBJECTIVE(S): To help clinicians in decision making for treatment of asymptomatic meningiomas. METHOD(S): A single center retrospective cohort study of 117 patients with 122 tumors treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS; Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Patients were followed with longitudinal imaging and clinical evaluations. Tumor volumetry and developments of new signs or symptoms after GKRS were the end points in the study. RESULT(S): Median patient age at GKRS was 60 yr (range 21-86 yr) with a median clinical follow-up of 53 mo (range 20-252 mo). The median pre-GKRS tumor volume was 3.6 +/- 3.8 cc (+/-standard deviation). Tumors were treated with a median margin dose of 14 +/- 2 Gy. At last follow-up, median tumor volume was 2.5 +/- 3.6 cc. Radiological progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 97% and 94.4% at 5 yr and 10 yr, respectively. Clinical PFS rates were 86% and 70% at 5 yr and 10 yr, respectively. Development of neurological complications was seen in 21 (18%) patients, and 11 (52%) of them had undergone surgical resection prior to GKRS. CONCLUSION(S): GKRS is a reasonable treatment strategy for asymptomatic meningiomas and compares favorably to natural history studies in terms of tumor control and neurological preservation. It results in relatively low morbidity in previously untreated meningiomas and serves as an appealing alternative treatment modality for recurrent meningiomas in asymptomatic patients.

In patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, lower facial weakness during emotional expression has been found to occur almost exclusively contralateral to the temporal lobe with the epileptogenic focus. Repetitive and chronic stimulation of the amygdala during eating has also been postulated as a probable mechanism for eating seizures. The authors present the illustrative aspects of both facial asymmetry and eating seizures in a case of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).

2371,"Against the motion: This house believes that hippocampus avoiding WBI is the current standard of care Because of advances in the management of several solid tumours such as NSCLC, breast cancer, melanoma, the risk of developing brain metastases (BM) seems to increase as survival is prolonged. Their management represents a real challenge because Symptomatic BM can cause life-threatening symptoms and serious impairment of quality of life. In the last 15 years, there has been development and widespread use of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), but this concerns a subgroup of patients who have a limited number of brain lesions, for whom brain SRT and/or surgery can be proposed. This strategy provides better results than whole-brain irradiation (WBI) with median survival exceeding 12 months. WBI is still regarded as standard treatment for multiple symptomatic BM, not accessible to SRT even though a randomised trial does not seem to support the use of this approach versus best supportive care in NSCLC. There is strong concern about the toxicity of such treatment. Acute toxicity is generally manageable but long-term sequelae such as neurocognitive toxicity and ataxia, are deleterious to the quality of life of patients. There are areas of active research that hold great potential to reduce the risk of neurocognitive decline after WBI such as hippocampal-sparing radiotherapy and the use of neuroprotective agents. As neurocognitive toxicity from WBI related to damage to neural progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and hippocampus and the induction of inflammation in the brain, several studies have been performed assessing hippocampus avoiding irradiation, considering that BM in the hippocampal region seem rare (about 5%), Promising results have been reported in patients having undergone WBI to treat BM. Another challenging area is evaluating prophylactic cranial irradiation with hippocampus avoidance, with contrasting preliminary results. The cause of radiation injury to the brain is likely to be multifactorial, and reducing radiation dose to the hippocampus may not be the only way to reduce neurotoxicity. Furthermore we need more mature results to conclude that it should the new standard of care. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded

It's incidence increases with age, slightly more in men than women. Less than 20% live longer than 1 year. Method(s): We present a case of a female patient who was diagnosed with a colo-rectal cancer. The cancer was staged as pT-3, N-0, M-0, G-2, R-0. He underwent a surgical intervention with colo-anal anastomosis. Than he was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: 5-FU and radiation. He was followed -up at the outpatient clinic of surgery. Two years later the patient complaint of back pain. A CT scan was performed, which found a solid lesion of the body of the pancreas with peripancreatic and truncus celiacus infiltration. Multiple liver metastes were found. A thoracic CT scan revealed metastatic lesions of both lungs, 7-8 mm in diameter. In these conditions the clinical diagnosis was made: Pancreatic cancer with pulmonary and liver metastatis, diabetes mellitus. Result(s): The stratification of the cancer showed a Stage 4 B, non resecable. The celiac plexus was accessed percutaneosly.

These changes are specific to neuronal systems that are affected by aging. Since 56Fe particles make up approximately 1-2% of cosmic rays, these findings suggest that the neuronal effects of heavy particle irradiation on long-term space flights may be significant, and may even supercede subsequent mutagenic effects in their mission capabilities. It is suggested that among other methods, it may be possible to utilize nutritional modification procedures to offset the putative deleterious effects of these particles in space.",Included
1970,"Effect of Gamma Knife surgery on the risk of rupture prior to AVM obliteration The incidence for hemorrhage in non-obliterated arteriovenous malformations (AVM) during the first two years following Gamma Knife (GK) surgery was compared to the calculated incidence in untreated patients. There was a decrease in the incidence of hemorrhage as compared to the natural course. This difference was statistically significant. The actual number of hemorrhages during the first two years was 49 in a series of 1604 patients. Additionally, 41 hemorrhages occurred beyond the two years following treatment over the entire follow up time span of up to 24 years. For the first two years the calculated incidence was roughly two times higher than the observed incidence. This impact on the natural history was detectable already within six months after the treatment for the malformations totally covered with at least 25 Gy. The relation between a high minimum and a high average dose on the one hand and a lower risk for hemorrhage on the other hand was statistically significant. Low treatment doses and high age correlated to a higher risk. Neither hemorrhage prior to treatment nor time interval between presenting hemorrhage and treatment seemed to influence the risk for post treatment hemorrhage. The risk for permanent neurological deficit or death due to AVM rupture during the latency period between the time of treatment and total nidus obliteration was less than 0.5% for small AVM and 2-4% for large ones during the first two years. Of the 24 patients with sequelae following AVM rupture after treatment 14 died and 10 remained with neurological deficit of different degrees. However, all survivors were self sufficient.",Included

Result(s): A 57-year-old man presented with rapidly progressing swelling and redness in his right eye for 2 months. A salmon-colored mass was present under all parts of the bulbar conjunctiva. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass anterior to the globe without any sinus involvement. Positron emission tomographic study did not show other disease sites. Immunohistopathological studies on incisional biopsy specimen demonstrated ENKTCL with positive CD2, CD7, CD56, bcl-2, and T cell-restricted intracellular antigen, and negative CD20, CD8, CD123, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase staining. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded mRNA was also diffusely positive. Ki-67 index was more than 90%.

We evaluated the effects of continuous wave (CW) or pulse wave (P) NILT administered transcranially either 6 or 12 h following embolization, on behavioral outcome. For the studies, we used the rabbit small clot embolic stroke model (RSCEM) using three different treatment regimens: 1) CW power density of 7.5 mW/cm(2); 2) P1 using a frequency of 300 mus pulse at 1 kHz or 3) P2 using a frequency of 2 ms pulse at 100 Hz. Behavioral analysis was conducted 48 h after embolization, allowing for the determination of the effective stroke dose (P(50)) or clot amount (mg) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits. Using the RSCEM, a treatment is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the P(50) compared with the control group. Quantal dose-response analysis showed that the control group P(50) value was 1.01+/-0.25 mg (n=31). NILT initiated 6 h following embolization resulted in the following P(50) values: (CW) 2.06+/-0.59 mg (n=29, P=0.099); (P1) 1.89+/-0.29 mg (n=25, P=0.0248) and (P2) 1.92+/-0.15 mg (n=33, P=0.0024). NILT started 12 h following embolization resulted in the following P(50) values: (CW) 2.89+/-1.76 mg (n=29, P=0.279); (P1) 2.40+/-0.99 mg (n=24, P=0.134). At the 6-h post-embolization treatment time, there was a statistically significant increase in P(50) values compared with control for both pulse P1 and P2 modes, but not the CW mode. At the 12-h post-embolization treatment time, neither the CW nor the P1 regimens resulted in statistically significant effect, although there was a trend for an improvement. The results show that P mode NILT can result in significant clinical improvement when administered 6 h following embolic strokes in rabbits and should be considered for clinical development.",Excluded

In addition, optical coherence microscopy (OCM), with its superior transverse spatial resolution, is used to demonstrate a direct correlation between scattering intensity changes and membrane voltage in single cultured Aplysia bag cell neurons during evoked action potentials. While intrinsic scattering changes are small, OCT and OCM have potential use as tools in neuroscience research for non-invasive and non-contact measurement of neural activity without electrodes or fluorescent dyes.

Materials/Methods: Patients treated with SBRT from June 2007 to November 2011 for metastases from primary gynecologic cancers (n=18) or as a boost when brachytherapy was not possible (n=3) with at least 6 months follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. The PTV included a 0.0 - 5.0 mm margin, depending on normal tissue proximity. For tumors where respiratory motion was present and bony anatomy could not be used for motion tracking, 1 to 3 gold fiducial markers were used. Extra-cranial body treatments to tumors, particularly lymph nodes, near the spine were tracked using the Xsight Spine Tracking System or, if fiducials were placed the Synchrony Tracking System was used. PET/ CT (preferred), CT or MRI imaging was used to assess local control after SBRT. Result(s): Twenty-one patients with 28 tumors received a median SBRT dose of 30 Gy (range, 12-60 Gy) delivered in a median of 5 fractions (range, 1-5). Median patient age was 62 years (range, 46-86 years). Primary tumor sites were cervical (42%), uterine (54%), and ovarian (4%). Tumor locations were 32% paraortic (PA), 11% pelvic sidewall (PS) and 11% central pelvic (CP) or 46% distant (DM). Distant metastases included bone (n=5), lymph nodes-not PA (n=4), lung (n=2) and brain (n=2). Most (62%) patients received chemotherapy prior to SBRT and 50% had prior radiation to the SBRT target site, most commonly external beam radiation delivered to the pelvis or paraortic region. Sixteen (76%) of patients remain alive with a median 21 months follow-up (range, 8 to 41 months) from time of SBRT. The actuarial 2-year survival rate from SBRT is 70%. Local failures occurred in 7 tumors at a median 9 months (range, 4 to 13 months) after SBRT resulting in a 2-year actuarial local control rate of 71%. The median duration of local control was 19 months (range, 8-41). No significant difference was found in local control rates between DM, PA, PS and CP tumors (p=0.6). Toxicities were limited with only 1 grade 3 (proctitis).

[German] Purpose: Radiotherapy became an important component in the treatment of brain gliomas. The aim of this study is to analyse several advantages of the three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy in comparison with a two- dimensional conventional technique and to present the clinical results of 43 patients with brain gliomas treated according to a three-dimensional planning. Patients and Method: Between January 1994 and December 1995, 43 Patients with malignant brain gliomas (WHO III and IV) were treated in our department according to a three-dimensional treatment planning. The patients received a total irradiation dose of 60 Gy, 2 Gy/day, 5 days/week. The rate of survival was analysed in relation with the known prognostical factors: histology, Karnofsky index, age, resection status. In 10 patients a three- dimensional treatment planning was compared with a conventional two- dimensional planning: the volume of the normal brain tissue irradiated to high dose levels (95% isodose) and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the brain by Kutcher and Lyman were comparatively analysed. Result(s): The survival rate for the whole group was 14 months. The histology of the tumor, age, Karnofsky index and resection status were important prognostical factors. The three-dimensional planning allows a 15 to 20% reduction in the volume of normal brain tissue irradiated to high dose levels (95% isodose). The NTCP is significantly lower using the three-dimensional technique (range 0.03% to 13%), in comparison with the two-dimensional conventional technique (range 0.1% to 26%). The value of NTCP increases with tumor volume. Conclusion(s): Concerning the tumor control and survival rate, the three-dimensional treatment planning shows no advantages compared to the standard conventional methods. The main advantage of the three-dimensional treatment planning is the possibility to spare normal brain tissue. This should enable a dose escalation in the tumor, with a minimal risk of side effects in the surrounding normal tissue. The possibility to integrate mathematical models in the evaluation of the therapy could give this technique new dimensions.",Excluded

Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) offers an additional treatment option. Data for radiological regression differ, ranging from 13 to 61%. Therefore, the aims of this prospective study were to quantitatively analyze tumor volume (TV) shrinkage and to calculate determining factors. METHOD(S): Eighty-four patients were examined under equal conditions before and after SRT. Fat-saturated axial T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans with 1- to 3-mm slice thickness were used. After image fusion, TV was drawn in each slice to analyze TV shrinkage three-dimensionally by the planning system. RESULT(S): Mean TV had shrunk by 33% at 24 months (P = 0.02) and by 36% at 36 months (P = 0.0007) after SRT. With regard to half-year intervals, TV reduction decreased continuously towards a steady state (P < 0.0001). Younger age (P = 0.001) and smaller TV (P = 0.01) are determining factors. There was no correlation between TV reduction, prescribed dose, histological classification, sex, or previous operations. CONCLUSION(S): Meningiomas shrink significantly after SRT. TV shrinkage declines towards a steady state, which is not yet defined. Younger age and smaller TV are determining factors. Previous operations, sex, prescribed dose, or histological subtypes do not affect TV shrinkage. Eighteen to 24 months after irradiation, when symptoms are clinically stable, is the best time for the first magnetic resonance imaging scans evaluating tumor control and shrinkage.

However cases of radiosensitization following conventional radiation therapy in BRAF-I treated patients have raised serious concerns about the real feasibility and risk/benefit ratio of this combination. Method(s): Blind review by 2 independent observers of brain MRI follow-up pictures and survival assessment in all patients who had been treated by GKRS and BRAF-I at a single institution. Result(s): Among53 GKRS performed in 30 patients who ever received BRAF-I and GKRS, 33 GKRS were performed in 24 patients while under BRAF-I treatment, from which only 4 with an interruption of BRAF-I. The 20 other GKRS were performed in 15 patients (including 9 of the 24) before initiation of BRAF-I treatment. Out of the 263 BM treated, only 3 edemas and 3 hemorrhages were detected within 2 months after GKRS and 4 edemas and 7 hemorrhages were detected later. No case of BM radiation necrosis and no scalp radiation dermatitis occurred. Neither the MRI features nor the incidence of the rare adverse events were deemed unexpected in such a population of melanoma BM. Median survival from first GKRS and first dose of BRAF-I was 24.7, and 48.8 weeks, respectively. Conclusion(s): This series does not show immediate radiotoxicity nor radiation-recall, in melanoma patients with BRAF-I whose BM are treated by GKRS. Interrupting BRAF-I for stereotactic radiosurgery of BM seems useless, although it is still advised for other radiation therapies. Overall very favorable survival figures suggest to test the potential benefit of combining stereotactic radiosurgery and BRAF-I.",Excluded
2347,"Magnetic resonance imaging of implanted deep brain stimulators: Experience in a large series Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a commonly used and important imaging modality to evaluate lead location and rule out complications after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Recent safety concerns have prompted new safety recommendations for the use of MRI in these patients, including a new recommendation to limit the specific absorption rate (SAR) of the MRI sequences used to less than 0.1 W/kg. Following SAR recommendations in real-world situations is problematic for a variety of reasons. We review our experience scanning patients with implanted DBS systems over a 7-year period using a variety of scanning techniques and four scanning platforms. 405 patients with 746 implanted DBS systems were imaged using 1.5-tesla MRI with an SAR of up to 3 W/kg. Many of the DBS systems were imaged multiple times, for a total of 1,071 MRI events in this group of patients with no adverse events. This series strongly suggests that the 0.1 W/kg recommendation for SAR may be unnecessarily low for the prevention of MRI-related adverse events. Copyright Â© 2007 S. Karger AG.",Excluded
1327,"Relationship between acoustic pressure used for BBB disruption and amount of MRI contrast agent delivered to the brain Objectives: The acoustic intensity needs to be very well known to efficiently open the Blood-brain Barrier (BBB) since it is mainly ruled by the mechanical index [1]. Previous studies have shown that a narrow range of peak negative pressure (PNP) is acceptable, corresponding to sufficient stable cavitation of injected microbubbles without reaching inertial cavitation responsible for irreversible damages. Within this range, only few data are available about how the pressure affects the strength of BBB disruption that is to say the amount of delivered drugs. We propose two new methods to evidence the opening threshold in vivo and measure this relationship after a MRI controlled protocol of the BBB opening: 1) Several different pressures are used at several brain locations during the same BBB opening session 2) A single point focal opening is performed and the brain uptake of contrast agent is correlated in each voxel with the pressure estimated from a MR-acoustic radiation force image [2]. Methods We use our previously introduced motorized MR-compatible FUS sys-tem [3] (Image Guided Therapy, France). An 8 channel annular array transducer operating at 1.5MHz (Imasonic, France) was calibrated in a water tank and acoustic transmission factors through rat skulls were measured in another study. This ability to shrewdly control the pressure we deliver in vivo in the brain is crucial for the two proposed methods. Fisher F344 rats (n=5, body weight=220g) were shaved and installed in the MRI bed of a 7T MRI scanner (Bruker) under isoflurane anesthesia. The transducer was coupled to the head with echographic gel. In a first experiment, after intravenous injection of microbubbles (Sonovue), a square trajectory was played with the transducer continuously shooting. 4 different pressures (0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 MPa) were applied on the 4 sides of the square. The transducer was moving at 10 mm/s, the size of the square was 5 mm and the trajectory was played 60 times. Then a 200muL Gadolinium based MRI contrast agent (Dotarem, Guerbet, France) was intravenously injected, at different time after the opening (10 minutes, 4 hours and 24 hours), and its uptake into the brain was quantitatively measured thank to T<inf>1</inf> maps. In a second experiment, the BBB was focally open with 0.6 MPa peak negative pressure at focus. Before the opening session, an Acoustic Radiation Force Image was acquired in order to estimate in vivo the pressure applied in each voxel during the BBB opening. After the opening, Dotarem was intravenously injected and the contrast agent concentration was measured in each voxel by acquiring T<inf>1</inf> maps [4]. The concentration in each voxel is then correlated to the pressure which has been used in this voxel to open the BBB. Results The first experiment with the square trajectory gives a rough estimation of the pressure threshold. Indeed it appears clearly (see Fig. 130) that the BBB is not open on the 0.25 and 0.35 MPa sides while it is open on the 0.45 and 0.55 MPa sides. The acoustic threshold must be between 0.35 and 0.45 MPa. With the second injection, we also found that the BBB was already close as soon as 4 hours after the opening even for the 0.55 MPa region. The second experiment gives a more accurate estimation of the pressure threshold. By plotting the concentrations in contrast agent in the voxel versus the pressure used in these voxel to open the BBB (see Fig. 131), two trends are observables. In a first pressure range, from 0 to 0.4 MPa, the pressure is not sufficient to open the BBB so the concentration is not significant. In a higher pressure range, from 0.4 MPa to 0.6MPa, the pressure is sufficient to open the BBB and the concentration increases as the pressure increases in a roughly linear way. With this experiment the found pressure threshold is about 0.4 MPa. A third way of determining the opening threshold is to study the width of the opening on the sides [LB1] of the square of the first ex-periment. Indeed it is possible to plot the concentration profile across the lines of the opening and t compare it to the Gaussian profile of the pressure which has been studied in water tank. It appeared that the width where the BBB is open matches with the width on the Gaussian profile where the pressure is higher than 0.4 MPa. Conclusions The two different methods proposed for the study of the dependency of drug uptake after BBB disruption with acoustic pressure give consistent results. We find an acoustic pressure threshold for the BBB opening of 0.4 MPa, for a 1.5 MHz working frequency. This result is in good accordance with the literature [5]. By acquiring T2 weighted images after those experiments, we are confident we caused no damages up to 0.6 MPa. This pressure is close to the one for which adverse effects started to appear in our previous studies thought. As a consequence, the pressure window for a safe and efficient BBB opening is quite narrow which highlights that the pressure in vivo has to be very well controlled. [LB1] Above the opening threshold, the relationship between drug uptake and acoustic pressure is linear. The knowledge of this relationship is key in order to predict drug pharmacokinetics after BBB disruption.",Excluded

At 24 h after induction of ICH, rats were randomly separated into three experimental groups: ICH with injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS group), ICH with intravenous injection of magnetosome-like ferrimagnetic iron oxide nanocubes (FION)-labeled SNMs (SNMs* group), and ICH with intravenous injection of FION-labeled SNMs followed by three days of external magnetic field exposure for targeted delivery by a magnet-embedded helmet (SNMs*+Helmet group). On day 3 after ICH induction, an increased Prussian blue-stained area and decreased swelling volume were observed in the SNMs*+Helmet group compared with that of the other groups. A significantly decreased recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils and a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines followed by improved neurological function three days after ICH were observed in the SNMs*+Helmet group. Hemispheric atrophy at six weeks after ICH was significantly decreased in the SNMs*+Helmet group compared with that of the PBS group. In conclusion, we have developed a targeted delivery system using FION tagged to stem cells and a magnet-embedded helmet. The targeted delivery of SNMs might have the potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies for ICH.",Excluded
1817,"Tumor treating fields: A novel therapy for glioblastoma multiforme Learning Objectives: To describe the rationale, indications, and literature supporting the use of Tumor Treating Fields in the first-line and second-line settings for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Main: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a novel anti-neoplastic treatment recently approved for clinical use for GBM. This new modality utilizes low intensity, intermediate frequency alternating electrical fields that have demonstrated anti-neoplastic efficacy in pre-clinical studies. The mechanism of action is postulated to include mitotic disruption at various points including dipole misalignment, impaired microtubule assembly, dielectrophoresis of intra-cellular molecules and organelle disruption, and asymmetric chromosome segregation. TTfields is delivered continuously to the brain by a patient-operated, wearable medical device (OptuneTM, Novocure Ltd.). A large (695 patients enrolled), international, randomized, phase 3 trial has recently confirmed the long-term efficacy of adding TTFields to standard maintenance chemotherapy after the completion of chemo-irradiation in newly diagnosed GBM. At 5-year follow-up, this trial demonstrated consistent superior tumor control (median PFS 6.7 vs. 4.0 months, p = 0.00005) and significantly improved survival (median OS 20.9 vs. 16 months, 5-year OS 13% vs. 5%, p = 0.00006) with the addition of TTFields to the current standard of care therapy. The magnitude of improvement when adding TTFields is comparable to the benefit observed with adding chemotherapy to radiation (demonstrated over a decade ago). There was no significant toxicity observed with TTfields (most commonly, mild dermatitis), and patient-reported quality of life was unaffected. On subset analysis, both MGMT hypermethylation-positive and negative tumor subtypes were found to significantly benefit from TTF. In the second-line setting, a prior phase III trial has demonstrated equal efficacy but improved toxicity and quality of life profiles as compared to physician's choice of 2nd-line chemotherapy in GBM progressing after standard therapy. TTF is now endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for both the 1st line and 2nd-line setting in the treatment of GBM.",Excluded

Methods We collected transmission scans to cover four body sections: A (eyes and whole brain), B (heart and lungs), C (liver, gallbladder and kidneys), and D (urinary bladder, small and large intestines) in two male and a female macaque fascicularis. This was followed by 4 hour long sequential whole-body scan immediately after injection of 5.01-5.36 mCi [<sup>18</sup>F]VAT tracer. Arterial blood samples were obtained in the female animal over a total scanning time. Time activity curves (TAC) were created from regions of Interest (ROIs) that encompassed entire small organs or samples with highest activity within large organs. Organ residence times were calculated based on TAC. We then entered the organ residence times in OLINDA/EXM to calculate human radiation dose estimates. Results The blood time activity resulted in a residence time 0.30 hr in agreement with the residence time calculated based on the time activity curve measured in the left ventricle by PET 0.39 hr. Organ dosimetry revealed liver as the critical organ 1.65E-01 rad/mCi and effect dose equivalent of 6.84E-02 rem/mCi. Conclusions The macaque bio-distribution data showed high retention of [<sup>18</sup>F]VAT in the liver and gallbladder, in favor of the hepatobiliary clearance.

Thirteen young right-handed male subjects were exposed to a pulse-modulated 902.4 MHz Global System for Mobile Communications signal for 33 minutes, while performing a simple visual vigilance task. Temperature was also measured in the head region (forehead, eyes, cheeks, ear canals) during exposure. (18)F-deoxyglucose PET images acquired after the exposure showed that relative cerebral metabolic rate of glucose was significantly reduced in the temporoparietal junction and anterior temporal lobe of the right hemisphere ipsilateral to the exposure. Temperature rise was also observed on the exposed side of the head, but the magnitude was very small. The exposure did not affect task performance (reaction time, error rate). Our results show that short-term mobile phone exposure can locally suppress brain energy metabolism in humans.",Excluded
1569,"Improving outcome in severe trauma: what's new in ABC? Imaging, bleeding and brain injury Appropriate imaging is critical in the initial assessment of patients with severe trauma. Plain radiographs remain integral to the primary survey. Focused ultrasonography is useful for identifying intraperitoneal fluid likely to represent haemorrhage in patients who are shocked and also has a role in identifying intrathoracic pathology. Modern scanners permit a greater role for CT, being more rapid and exposing the patient to less ionising radiation. 'Whole body' (head to pelvis) CT scanning has been shown to identify injuries missed by 'traditional' focused assessment and may be associated with an improved outcome. CT identifies more spinal injuries than plain radiographs, is the gold standard for diagnosing blunt aortic injury and facilitates non-operative management of solid organ injury and other bleeding. Coagulopathy occurs early in trauma as a direct result of injury and hypoperfusion. Damage control resuscitation with blood components is associated with an improved outcome in patients with trauma with massive haemorrhage. Packed cells and fresh frozen plasma should be used in a 1:1 to 1:2 ratio. Bedside measures of coagulopathy may prove useful. Adjuvant early treatment with tranexamic acid is of benefit in reducing blood loss and reducing mortality. Limited 'damage control surgery' with early optimisation of physiology augmented by interventional radiology to control haemorrhage is preferable to early definitive care. Limiting haemorrhage by correction of anticoagulation and minimising secondary brain injury through optimal supportive care is critical to improving outcome in neurotrauma.",Excluded
2030,"Current concepts in the management of erectile dysfunction in men with prostate cancer Development in the management of prostate cancer has placed increased attention on patient quality of life after treatment, particularly sexual function. The incidence of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men following radical prostatectomy has been estimated to range from 16% to 82%. Several factors determine the postoperative incidence of erectile difficulties; these include patient age, degree of cavernosal nerve sparing during surgery, cancer stage, and associated comorbidities. Early initiation of available treatments after radical prostatectomy, such as phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and intracavernosal alprostadil, may improve the speed and degree of recovery of erectile function. Oral PDE-5 inhibitors are recognized as the first line of therapy for men with ED after radical prostatectomy, with reasonable success rates reported for all commercially available PDE-5 inhibitors. In recognition of the neurogenic basis for erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy, new strategies have been devised, such as cavernous nerve graft interposition procedures, perioperative neuroprotection measures, and postoperative neurotrophic treatments. Hopefully, these efforts will improve quality of life for patients with prostate cancer. The aim of this article is to review the current modalities of ED management for men with prostate cancer.

2017,"Novel snapshot imaging of photoreceptor bleaching in macaque and human retinas PURPOSE: Various methods have been used to obtain a topographic map of bleached photopigments in human retinas in the past. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the bleaching topography of the photoreceptors could be obtained by snapshot imaging reflectometry.METHODS: Four to five fundus photographs of one rhesus monkey and three healthy human subjects were taken by white flashes at intervals of 4 s, with a commercial fundus camera with minimal modifications. The flash-induced reflectance increases (bleaching) were calculated by dividing the reflectance of the first image into the subsequent images, pixel by pixel.RESULTS: The topography of the bleached macula corresponded well with the anatomical distribution of the cones. The ratio of reflectance changes in the center to that in the surrounding tissue was high for red and low for green and blue images. These results indicate that the reflectivity changes were not artifacts but were derived from changes in the photopigment density in the cones and rods.CONCLUSIONS: The topography of bleached photoreceptors obtained with a commercial fundus camera from one monkey and three healthy human subjects showed that this technique has potential as a new clinical method for examining photoreceptor function in both normal and diseased retinas.",Excluded
1377,"Predicting Risk in Space: Genetic Markers for Differential Vulnerability to Sleep Restriction Several laboratories have found large, highly reliable individual differences in the magnitude of cognitive performance, fatigue and sleepiness, and sleep homeostatic vulnerability to acute total sleep deprivation and to chronic sleep restriction in healthy adults. Such individual differences in neurobehavioral performance are also observed in space flight as a result of sleep loss. The reasons for these stable phenotypic differential vulnerabilities are unknown: such differences are not yet accounted for by demographic factors, IQ or sleep need, and moreover, psychometric scales do not predict those individuals cognitively vulnerable to sleep loss. The stable, trait-like (phenotypic) inter-individual differences observed in response to sleep loss-with intraclass correlation coefficients accounting for 58%-92% of the variance in neurobehavioral measures- point to an underlying genetic component. To this end, we utilized multi-day highly controlled laboratory studies to investigate the role of various common candidate gene variants-each independently-in relation to cumulative neurobehavioral and sleep homeostatic responses to sleep restriction. These data suggest that common genetic variations (polymorphisms) involved in sleep-wake, circadian, and cognitive regulation may serve as markers for prediction of inter-individual differences in sleep homeostatic and neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep restriction in healthy adults. Identification of genetic predictors of differential vulnerability to sleep restriction-as determined from candidate gene studies-will help identify astronauts most in need of fatigue countermeasures in space flight and inform medical standards for obtaining adequate sleep in space. This review summarizes individual differences in neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep deprivation and ongoing genetic efforts to identify markers of such differences.",Excluded
2070,"Cost-Effectiveness of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Versus MRI Surveillance for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Purpose: Owing to conflicting prospective data, controversy exists regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PCI versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance for patients with ES-SCLC based on currently available evidence and in the context of the proposed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services alternative payment model. Methods and Materials: A Markov state transition model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing MRI surveillance alone with PCI for ES-SCLC. Clinical parameters were obtained from clinical trial data, and cost data were based on 2019 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and evaluated with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to consider model uncertainty. Result(s): In the base-case scenario, PCI was not cost-effective in this model, with an ICER of $168,456 per QALY gained compared with MRI surveillance alone, assuming that overall survival was 10 months for MRI surveillance alone and 12.5 months for PCI. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to the variation of overall survival and cognitive decline rates between the 2 groups. In a scenario analysis in which all patients received hippocampal-avoidance PCI, the model results became nearly cost-effective with PCI. Conclusion(s): PCI was not found to be cost-effective within this model compared with MRI surveillance alone, owing to the neurocognition decline effect of PCI based on available evidence. Hippocampal-avoidance PCI may be a potential cost-effective strategy for ES-SCLC, with confirmation expected after an ongoing prospective clinical trial (The Southwest Oncolology Group MRI Brain Surveillance Alone Versus MRI Surveillance And Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation [MAVERICK]), which includes assessments of cognitive function.

1658,"Five-year experience with combined operative and radiotherapeutic treatment of recurrent gynecologic tumors infiltrating the pelvic wall BACKGROUND: Whereas 25 to 50% of selected patients with gynecologic tumors who relapse centrally in an irradiated pelvis can be salvaged by exenteration, postirradiation recurrence infiltrating the pelvic side wall generally has been fatal. We have designed the combined operative and radiotherapeutic treatment (CORT) procedure for the treatment of postirradiation recurrence infiltrating the pelvic wall and developed several new techniques for its realization. The aim of the surgery is as follows: (1) total resection of the tumor with only a microscopic margin (R1) at the pelvic wall, preserving the bony pelvis and the neurovascular support of the leg; (2) modulation of the therapeutic index for a second high-dose irradiation of the pelvic wall by transferring autologous tissue from the abdomen or the thigh, and (3) reconstruction of pelvic organ functions lost due to tumor resection. The tumor bed is irradiated postoperatively with brachytherapy through transcutaneous guide tubes implanted at the pelvic wall.METHODS: Between April 1989 and December 1994, we treated 48 patients with postirradiation recurrent or persistent gynecologic malignancies infiltrating the pelvic wall with CORT and followed them prospectively with the following endpoints: tumor control, survival, complications, and quality of life.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 33 months (range, 3-71 months), the 5-year survival probability calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method was 44%. The overall local control rate was 68%, and 85% in the last 25 patients in the series. The censored severe complication rate at 5 years was 33%. No patient died as a consequence of the treatment. Quality of life was self-assessed with a validated questionnaire by 15 patients without evidence of disease, and was rated with a total of 74% of the maximum score points. Age of the patient, state of resection at the pelvic wall (R1 vs. R2), and recurrent tumor size independently influenced tumor progression after CORT in this series.CONCLUSIONS: CORT appears to be a feasible, innovative treatment with long term survival potential and acceptable quality of life for selected patients with postirradiation gynecologic tumor recurrence infiltrating the pelvic wall. R1 resection of the tumor at the pelvic wall is mandatory; however, the reconstruction options within the pelvis are limited.",Excluded
1735,"Spinal cord compression in prostate cancer: treatment outcome and prognostic factors BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord compression (SCC) is an important complication of metastatic prostate cancer. We have analysed patients treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital to assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors in this patients group.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of 69 patients with spinal cord compression and prostate cancer treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital.RESULTS: At presentation 40 (58%) patients were non-ambulant and 52% were catheterised. Diagnosis was established by myelography in 42% and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 47% of patients. MRI detected significantly more patients with multiple sites of compression (51 versus 7%, P < 0.001). SCC was present at the initial diagnosis of prostatic cancer in 13 patients and 17 patients had received no hormone treatment prior to diagnosis. Following treatment 36 (52%) patients had a functional improvement of motor power with 25/40 (63%) non-ambulant patients becoming ambulant. Seventy-seven percent of patients who had eventual improvement had some improvement in power within 7 days. On multivariate analysis a single level of compression, no previous hormone therapy and a young age (<65 years) predicted for better outcome. When these factors were included an increased radiation dose (>30 Gy) or the addition of surgery did not improve the functional outcome. Following initial recovery; there was a 45% risk of developing a further episode of cord compression at the same or new site by 2 years with a median time to progression of 236 days (range 47-1215 days). The median survival was 115 days (range 5-2016 days) with 25% of patients surviving for 2 years. Patients with no prior hormone therapy had a median survival of 627 days (range 46-1516 days). Other predictors of improved survival on multivariate analysis were a single site of compression and a haemoglobin over 12 g.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of SCC in prostate cancer results in improved motor function in the majority of patients. Long-term survival is possible, especially in good performance status patients with no prior hormone treatment. Survivors remain at high risk of subsequent neurological relapse. An early improvement in motor power is a strong predictor of subsequent functional improvement. MRI detects additional sites of asymptomatic SCC which makes it the investigation of choice.",Excluded

Methods We analyzed 3,910 participants whose serum folate levels were within the normal reference range (1.5-16.9 ng/mL) at baseline evaluation in the population-based prospective cohort study named the ""Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and De-mentia."" The association between baseline folate quartile categories and baseline cognitive disorders [mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia] was examined using binary logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounding variables. The risks of incident MCI and dementia associated with the decline of serum folate level during a 4-year follow-up period were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results The lowest quartile group of serum folate (>=1.5, <=5.9 ng/mL) showed a higher risk of cognitive disorders than did the highest quartile group at baseline evaluation (odds ratio 1.314, p=0.012). Over the 4 years of follow-up, the risk of incident dementia was 2.364 times higher among subjects whose serum folate levels declined from the 2nd-4th quartile group to the 1st quartile than among those for whom it did not (p=0.031). Conclusion Normal-but-low serum folate levels were associated with the risk of cognitive disorders in the elderly population, and a decline to normal-but-low serum folate levels was associated with incident dementia.

1939,"Implication of prostaglandins and histamine H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> receptors in radiation-induced temperature responses of rats Exposure of rats to 1-15 Gy gamma radiation (<sup>60</sup>Co) induced hyperthermia, whereas 20-200 Gy induced hypothermia. Exposure either to the head or the whole body to 10 Gy induced hyperthermia, while body-only exposure produced hypothermia. This observation indicates that radiation-induced fever is a result of a direct effect on the brain. The hyperthermia due to 10 Gy was significantly attenuated by the pre- or post-treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Hyperthermia was also altered by the central administration of a mu-receptor antagonist naloxone but only at low doses of radiation. These findings suggest that radiation-induced hyperthermia may be mediated through the synthesis and release of prostaglandins in the brain and to a lesser extent to the release of endogenous opioid peptides. The release of histamine acting on H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> receptors may be involved in radiation-induced hypothermia, since both the H<inf>1</inf> receptor antagonist, mepyramine, and H<inf>2</inf> receptor antagonist, cimetidine, antagonized the hypothermia. The results of these studies suggest that the release of neurohumoral substances induced by exposure to ionizing radiation is dose dependent and has different consequences on physiological processes such as the regulation of body temperature. Furthermore, the antagonism of radiation-induced hyperthermia by indomethacin may have potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of fever resulting from accidental irradiations.",Included
2047,"Riluzole enhances ionizing radiation-induced cytotoxicity in human melanoma cells that ectopically express metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 in vitro and in vivo PURPOSE: Brain metastases are a common preterminal event in patients with metastatic melanoma and require radiation therapy. Our group has previously shown that human GRM1 (hGRM1) expressing melanoma cells release excess extracellular glutamate and are growth inhibited by riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release. Riluzole-treated cells accumulate in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle at 24 hours, and then undergo apoptotic cell death. We evaluated whether riluzole enhanced radiosensitivity in melanoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clonogenic assays were performed to evaluate clonogenic survival after treatment in hGRM1 expressing and nonexpressing melanoma cells. Western immunoblots were performed to confirm apoptotic cell death. A xenograft mouse model was used to validate the in vitro experiments. Tumors harvested from the xenografts were fixed and stained for apoptosis and DNA damage markers.RESULTS: In the hGRM1-positive cell lines C8161 and UACC903, riluzole enhanced the lethal effects of ionizing radiation; no difference was seen in the hGRM1-negative UACC930 cell line. C8161 cells treated with riluzole plus irradiation also showed the highest levels of the cleaved forms of PARP and caspase-3; excised C8161 xenografts showed the greatest number of apoptotic cells by immunohistochemistry (P < 0.001). On cell cycle analysis, a sequence-dependent enrichment in the G(2)/M phase was shown with the combination of riluzole and irradiation. Xenografts treated with riluzole and weekly radiation fractions showed significant growth inhibition and revealed markedly increased DNA damage.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown, in vitro and in vivo, that the combination of riluzole and ionizing radiation leads to greater cytotoxicity.

1665,"The effect of immunosuppression by total-body irradiation on the pharmacodynamics of centrally active drugs in rats The aim of this investigation was to assess whether immunosuppression induced by total-body irradiation (TBI) affects the pharmacodynamics of centrally acting drugs. Female Sabra rats were exposed to a single dose of gamma irradiation (5.3 Gy). Four days later, when both the cellular and the humoral immune responses were impaired, they received an i.v. infusion of either phenobarbital (0.8 mg/min), ethanol (16.3 mg/min), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 0.618 mg/min), or theophylline (as aminophylline; 2 mg/min). The infusion was stopped at the onset of the pharmacologic end point--loss of righting reflex for the depressant agents or maximal seizures for the stimulant drugs--and the concentrations of the neuroactive drugs at that point were determined. In the ethanol experiment, blood samples were also taken upon awakening. The radiation-induced immunosuppression significantly decreased the CNS sensitivity to the depressant action of both phenobarbital and ethanol as indicated by the higher CSF phenobarbital concentrations required to induce sleep in the irradiated rats versus controls (156 +/- 4 vs 133 +/- 5 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.05), and the higher serum ethanol concentrations at the onset and offset of sleep in the immunosuppressed group versus control values (4.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.68 +/- 0.01 vs 3.79 +/- 0.17 and 1.32 +/- 0.9 mg/mL, respectively; P < 0.04).

1212,"Characterization of bone mineral crystals in horse radius by small-angle X-ray scattering The size and the orientation of the bone salt (mineral) crystals in the cranial and caudal zones in the transverse midshaft section of the equine radius were investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The results are interpreted as indicating that the crystals had an elongated shape with an average thickness of T = 3.17 +/- 0. 15 nm in the caudal region and T = 3.79 +/- 0.20 nm in the cranial region. Their orientation was predominantly in the longitudinal direction of the bone. There was no preferential orientation within the transverse plane. The distribution of tilt angles with respect to the longitudinal direction was determined directly from the SAXS data: the average angle was about 30 degrees for the cranial region and 45 degrees for the caudal region. Assuming that the needle-like crystals are parallel with the collagen fibrils, the angular distribution of the crystals is in good agreement with previous measurements of collagen orientation using circularly polarized light microscopy.",Excluded
2072,"Inhibition ofSTAT3 enhances the radiosensitising effect of Temozolomide in Glioblastoma model Purpose or Objective: Despite aggressive treatment with radiation therapy plus temozolomide (TMZ), the prognosis for glioblastoma remains poor. We investigated the potential of targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) to improve the therapeutic outcome of glioblastoma. Material(s) and Method(s): We evaluated the preclinical potential of a STAT3 inhibitor, Cpd188 combined with temozolomide and radiation in vitro assays using two established glioblastoma cell lines (U251,U87) and two patients-derived glioblastoma cell lines (GBL12, GBL28) and in vivo studies using nude mice bearing intracranial U251 xenografts. Result(s): Cpd188 potentiated the radiosensitizing effect of TMZ in U251 cell which has high levels of p-STAT3 expression. Increased radiosensitizing effects of TMZ were associated with impaired DNA damage repair, apoptosis and the reversion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cpd188 delayed in vivo tumor growth both alone and in combination with radiation and TMZ. We also confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of Cpd188 of GBL28 cell which was originated from a patient with high level of STAT3 expression and unmethylated MGMT. Conclusion(s): Targeting STAT3 using Cpd188 could be a viable therapeutic approach to improve the outcome of current standard therapy for glioblastoma patients having high p- STAT3 expression regardless of MGMT methylation status.",Excluded

1472,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) complements magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a non-invasive means for the characterization of tissue. While MRI uses the signal from hydrogen protons to form anatomic images, proton MRS uses this information to determine the concentration of brain metabolites such as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr) and lactate in the tissue examined. The most widely used clinical application of MRS has been in the evaluation of central nervous system disorders. MRS has its limitations and is not always specific but, with good technique and in combination with clinical information and conventional MRI, can be very helpful in diagnosing certain entities. For example, a specific pattern of metabolites can be seen in disorders such as Canavan's disease, creatine deficiency, and untreated bacterial brain abscess. MRS may also be helpful in the differentiation of high grade from low grade brain tumors, and perhaps in separating recurrent brain neoplasm from radiation injury.",Excluded
2162,"Highly favourable outcomes with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) for metastatic rectal neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN) Purpose: Rectal neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN) is more common than other NEN origins, but is less commonly metastatic. However, when present, distant disease carries a particularly poor prognosis. Evidence guiding optimal treatment of such patients is lacking. We assessed PRRT outcomes in patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive metastatic rectal NEN from two referral centres. Method(s): Patients treated with PRRT were retrospectively reviewed. Morphologic (RECIST 1.1), SSTR imaging responses and toxicity were assessed 3 months post-PRRT. Kaplan-Meier estimate was used to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from start of PRRT. Result(s): Twenty-seven consecutive patients (M = 20, age 31-81 years) were reviewed. The majority (70%) had ENETs grade 2 disease (19 patients), three had Grade 3, one Grade 1, and four not documented. Overall, 63% (10/16 patients with available FDG PET/CT) had FDG avid disease. Twenty-six patients were treated for disease progression. Most had <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-octreotate with median cumulative activity of 30 GBq, median four cycles. 14 patients had radiosensitising chemotherapy (5FU or capecitabine). At 3 months post-PRRT, CT disease control rate (DCR) was 96%: partial response was observed in 70% (19/27) and stable disease in 26%. All but one had partial SSTR imaging response. The median PFS was 29 months. Ten patients died, with median overall survival 81 months with a median follow-up of 67 months. Seventeen patients had further treatments after initial PRRT (10 had further cycles of PRRT). Three patients had grade 3 lymphopenia, without significant renal toxicity, MDS or leukaemia. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate high efficacy and morphologic responses with minimal toxicity and very encouraging survival from PRRT in patients with metastatic rectal NEN despite the adverse prognostic features of this cohort. Further prospective PRRT trials are warranted in this subgroup. Copyright Â© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

2209,"Pneumonectomy for lung cancer after preoperative concurrent chemotherapy and high-dose radiation BACKGROUND: We studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing pneumonectomy after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation for non-small cell lung cancer.METHODS: Clinical records of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent pneumonectomy at our institution between 1995 and 2005 after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation were reviewed retrospectively.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients underwent pneumonectomy after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation. Of the 21 men and 8 women who were treated, 1 had stage IIB (T3N0M0) and the remainder had stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Mean patient age at surgery was 53.4 years. There were 15 right pneumonectomies, of which 2 were for pancoast tumors. All patients received concurrent preoperative chemoradiation. Mean total radiation dose was 61.1 Gy. All patients went on to have complete (R0) resection by pneumonectomy. Pathologic complete response was found in 16 patients (55.2%). All patients were discharged alive from the hospital after pneumonectomy. Median hospital length of stay was 5 days (mean 8.6). Ninety-day mortality after surgery was 3.4% (n = 1). Recurrences have been found in 11 patients (38%), including brain metastases (n = 6), bone metastases (n = 4), liver metastases (n = 2), and cervical lymph node metastases (n = 2). One patient had a contralateral new primary lung cancer develop 70 months after undergoing pneumonectomy. Estimated 5-year disease-free survival is 48%. Median survival time has not been reached.CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonectomy can be performed safely after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, even with high-dose radiation. The frequency of disease recurrence in the brain underscores the need to evaluate the role of prophylactic cranial radiation in non-small cell lung cancer.",Excluded
1868,"Effect of Pregabalin on Radiotherapy-Related Neuropathic Pain in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial PURPOSE: Neuropathic pain is an unavoidable treatment-related adverse event among patients with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiotherapy. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of pregabalin versus placebo in the treatment of radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in four centers in China. Eligible patients with a mean pain intensity score of 4 or more on an 11-point numeric rating scale were randomly assigned to receive either active treatment with a flexible dose of pregabalin or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was pain reduction measured on the numeric rating scale.RESULT: There were 128 patients who received treatment as randomly assigned. Pain intensity reduction was 2.44 in the pregabalin arm and 1.58 in the placebo arm at week 16, yielding an adjusted mean difference of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.30 to 1.44; P = .003). In the pregabalin arm, 38 patients (59.4%) achieved at least 30% pain relief versus 21 (32.8%) in the placebo arm ( P = .006). Nineteen patients (29.7%) in the pregabalin group and five (7.8%) in the placebo group achieved 50% or greater pain relief ( P = .003). Total scores on the Profile of Mood States-Short Form, pain severity and functional interference of Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, as well as the physiology and psychology domain of the WHO Quality of Life-BREF all were reduced significantly at week 16 in patients who received pregabalin compared with those who received placebo. There was no significant difference ( P = .29) in the incidence of experiencing at least one adverse event in the pregabalin arm (n = 35; 54.7%) versus the placebo arm (n = 29; 45.3%).CONCLUSION: Patients treated with pregabalin with radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain had greater pain alleviation, better mood states, and higher quality of life compared with patients in the placebo group, with a good tolerability.",Excluded
1463,"Subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of young rabbits as a secondary matrix. A high-resolution autoradiographic study Cell genesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of 2-month-old rabbits has been investigated. After incorporation of tritiated thymidine, electron microscopic autoradiography allowed description of the ultrastructure of the cells labelled and the progressive transformation of these cells into granular neurons to be followed. Quantitative evaluation of the time course of this transformation has been performed by light microscope autoradiography using 1-micrometer sections. Precursor cells, labelled initially with 3H-thymidine, were transformed after 5 days into early neuroblasts, these cells in turn giving rise to neurons some 8 days later. At the latest time period examined (42 days), 80% of the labelled cells were neurons; more than 10% remained as precursor cells. It is suspected that the latter may behave as reserve cells. Small numbers of glial cells, astrocytes, and microglia, scattered throughout the hilus of the dentate gyrus and the molecular layer, were found labelled, and it is possible that they arise from a different precusor pool. It is concluded that the subgranular zone functions as a secondary matrix for granule neurons of the dentate gyrus in young rabbits. These late-forming and apparently synaptically uncommitted neurons may be recruited during the development and refinement of postnatal behavioral substrates, by one or other of the dominant afferent systems.",Excluded

Three malignant glioma tumor cell cultures (HTZ17, 146 and 209 B) were sequentially treated in vitro by increasing doses of 4-hydroperoxy-ifosfamide, according to in vivo/in vitro pharmacokinetic correlation (0.01 to 10 microM), and increasing single doses of Gamma-radiation (clinical60Co-radiotherapy unit, 0.26 to 4 Gy or 1 to 3.38 Gy, respectively). After approximately five population doubling times with standard tissue culture conditions, 3H-Tdr-incorporation was determined by a liquid scintillation counting protocol. Data points were evaluated for mono- and combined treatment dose-effects. A model-free 3D-response surface was created and compared to the theoretical additive response surface. Local additivity was analysed for any desired ratio of combined treatment as well as for isoboles. No significant sub- or supraadditive effects were observed, indicating additive effects in all 3 tumors. No sequence dependence of effects could be demonstrated. In case radiotherapy and ifosfamide-chemotherapy are active treatment modalities and additive effects are found, we conclude that the combination of ifosfamide and radiotherapy might be attractive for the treatment of malignant brain tumors and should be further studied.",Excluded

All four patients have decreased central acuity, and three of the four are legally blind in one or both eyes. Computer reconstruction of the dosimetry, based on computed tomography and beam profiles, shows that errors in dosage calculations and radiotherapy technique probably account for the radiation retinopathy in three of the four patients.

While systemic injection of the radioprotectant S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721) did not block hyperthermia induced by exposure to 10 Gy of gamma radiation, central administration did attenuate it. The dephosphorylated metabolite of WR-2721, N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,3-diaminopropane (WR-1065), accentuated radiation-induced hypothermia by both routes of administration. In brain homogenates, oxygen uptake was inhibited by WR-2721 but elevated by WR-1065. These results suggest that the antagonism of radiation-induced hypothermia found only after central administration of WR-2721 is due to its direct actions and not to its dephosphorylated metabolite and that this effect may be correlated with the inhibition by WR-2721 of oxygen uptake.",Included

1468,"Circadian and photic regulation of immediate-early gene expression in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus is the site of an endogenous circadian clock synchronized by daily light-dark cycles. At some daily phases, light exposure both shifts the clock and alters the expression of several immediate-early genes in cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We have studied both spontaneous circadian and light-induced expression of several immediate-early gene messenger RNAs and proteins in hamsters in constant darkness or in response to brief light exposure. There was no detectable spontaneous expression of NGFI-A messenger RNA in suprachiasmatic nucleus cells at any circadian phase, but light pulses induced its expression selectively during the subjective night, with highest levels of expression 6 h into the night. We also found that there are two independent rhythms of expression of junB messenger RNA and JunB protein, as well as c-fos messenger RNA and c-Fos protein, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of hamsters: a rhythm of photic sensitivity expressed throughout the night and a spontaneous rhythm of expression triggered around dawn. Induction of NGFI-A messenger RNA and c-fos messenger RNA and c-Fos protein in response to a light pulse were found throughout the suprachiasmatic nucleus, with the highest levels of expression in the ventrolateral subdivision; however, the spontaneous expression of JunB and c-Fos proteins was confined mainly to the dorsomedial suprachiasmatic nucleus. The temporal and anatomical differences in the expression of these immediate-early genes in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus suggest that their protein products may be involved in different signaling mechanisms mediating either photic entrainment or endogenous oscillations within distinct subpopulations of suprachiasmatic nucleus cells.",Excluded

Recombinant erythropoietin promoted resistance to radiotherapy or anti-PD-L1 therapies by restoring Ter cell numbers and serum ARTN concentration. Blockade of ARTN or potential ARTN signaling partners, or depletion of Ter cells augmented the antitumor effects of both IR and anti-PD-L1 therapies in mice. Analysis of samples from patients who received radioimmunotherapy demonstrated that IR-mediated reduction of Ter cells, ARTN, and GFRalpha3, an ARTN signaling partner, were each associated with tumor regression. Patients with melanoma who received immunotherapy exhibited favorable outcomes associated with decreased expression of GFRalpha3. These findings demonstrate an out-of-field, or ""abscopal,"" effect mediated by adaptive immunity, which is induced during local tumor irradiation.

We studied cytotoxic effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon beams on glioma cell lines with either mutant or wild-type p53.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cell lines U-87 and U-138 expressing wild-type p53 and U-251 and U-373 expressing mutant p53 were used. These cells were irradiated with 290 MeV/u carbon beams generated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in the National Institute of Radiologic Science or X-rays. A standard colony-forming assay and flow cytometric detection of apoptosis were performed. Cell cycle progression and the expression of p53, p21, and bax proteins were examined.RESULTS: High LET carbon radiation was more cytotoxic than low LET X-ray treatment against glioma cells. The effects of the carbon beams were not dependent on the p53 gene status but were reduced by G(1) arrest, which was independent of p21 expression. The expression of bax remained unchanged in all four cell lines.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that high LET charged particle radiation can induce cell death in glioma cells more effectively than X-rays and that cell death other than p53-dependent apoptosis may participate in the cytotoxicity of heavy charged particles. Thus, it might prove to be an effective alternative radiotherapy for patients with gliomas harboring mutated p53 gene.",Excluded
1999,"Recent advances in neuro-imaging and the impact on neuro-ophthalmology Neuro-imaging is an essential part of the evaluation in patients with neuro-ophthalmologic disorders. Over the last two decades enormous advances in this area have been made allowing noninvasive evaluation of the orbit and brain. The idea of using nuclear magnetic resonance technology to produce images rather than the ionizing radiation of computed tomography (CT) began to emerge clinically in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Although the quality of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was not much better than CT images, by the early 1990s, it became obvious that MRI had particular strength in identifying lesions in the posterior fossa, and demyelinating plaques. With advances in magnetic strength, computer software, surface coils, contrast medium, and more attention to the basic physics of magnet technology, the clarity of MR images improved dramatically. Recent advances in CT scanning (spiral and three-dimensional CT) and MRI (functional MRI and cine MRI) continue to affect significant changes in the discipline of neuro-ophthalmology. Furthermore, advances in MR angiography promise to allow excellent and noninvasive analysis of the cerebral vasculature. This review highlights the recent advances in neuro-imaging.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of hypofractionated radiation therapy with concurrent temozolomide in terms of feasibility and disease control in primary glioblastoma patients with poor prognostic factors other than advanced age, such as post-surgical neurological complications, high tumor burden, unresectable or multifocal lesions, and potential low treatment compliance due to social factors or rapidly progressive disease.MATERIAL AND METHODS: GTV included the surgical cavity plus disease visible in T1WI-MRI, FLAIR-MRI and in the MET-uptake. The CTV was defined as the GTV plus 1.5-2 cm margin; the PTV was the CTV+0.3 cm margin. Forty, fourty-five, and fifty grays in 15 fractions were prescribed to 95% of PTV, CTV, and GTV, respectively. Treatment was delivered using IMRT or the VMAT technique. Simultaneously, 75 mg/m2/day of temozolomide were administered.RESULTS: Between January 2010 and November 2017, we treated a total of 17 patients. The median age at diagnosis was 68-years; median KPS was 50-70%. MGMT-methylation status was negative in 5 patients, and 8 patients were IDH-wildtype. Eight of 18 patients were younger than 65-years. Median tumor volume was 26.95cc; median PTV volume was 322cc. Four lesions were unresectable; 6 patients underwent complete surgical resection. Median residual volume was 1.14cc. Progression-free survival was 60% at 6 months, 33% at 1-year and 13% at 2-years (median OS = 7 months). No acute grade 3-5 toxicities were documented. Symptomatic grade 3 radiation necrosis was observed in one patient.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with poor clinical factors other than advanced age can be selected for hypofractionated radiotherapy. The OS and PFS rates obtained in our series are similar to those in patients treated with standard fractionation, assuring good treatment adherence, low rates of toxicity and probable improved cost-effectiveness.",Excluded

Lenses of six colors, except for the SY, PN, and reflective coating lenses, strongly decreased the reduction in cell damage induced by blue LED light exposure. The deep yellow lens showed the most protective effect from all the lenses, but the reflective coating lens and pink lens did not show any effects on photoreceptor-derived cell damage. Moreover, these results were correlated with the lens transmittance of blue LED light (464 nm).

1821,"Role of gamma knife therapy in the management of pituitary tumors 1. Gamma knife therapy is an effective method of delivering radiation to pituitary tumors that have failed surgery and may be used as primary treatment in circumstances in which the patient refuses or is unsuitable for a transsphenoidal procedure. 2. Stereotactic radiosurgery with the gamma knife unit is generally administered in a single session unlike fractionated radiotherapy, which is administered four to five times per week over a 6-week period. 3. Preliminary data suggest that resolution of pituitary hypersecretion is faster with gamma knife therapy than with conventional radiotherapy. 4. Because of the nature of the gamma knife therapy and the fact that the radiation dose conforms to the tumor shape, there is a steep fall-off of radiation to surrounding tissue. Accordingly, the radiation dose to extrapituitary brain is substantially less with gamma knife radiosurgery than with conventional radiotherapy. This suggests that the development of second brain tumors and neurocognitive complications, which are significant risks with conventional radiotherapy, is much less likely with gamma knife surgery. 5. Gamma knife radiosurgery can be used to ablate tumors invading the cavernous sinus. 6. Gamma knife radiosurgery is safe as long as the dose of radiation to the optic structures is kept under 10 Gy. 7. Long-term follow-up is required for pituitary tumors treated by gamma knife therapy so as to determine its efficacy as well as its effects on pituitary function and any resultant complications.

A single-institution retrospective study BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage (iSAH) is a common finding in the emergency department. In many centers, a repeat CT scan is routinely performed 24 to72 h following the trauma to rule out further radiological progression. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical utility of the repeat CT scan in clinical practice.METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of all patients who presented to our institution with mild TBI (mTBI) and isolated SAH between January 2015 and October 2017. CT scan at admission and control after 24 to 72 h were examined for each patient in order to detect any possible change. Neurological deterioration, antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy, coagulopathy, SAH location, associated injuries, and length of stay in hospital were analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 649 TBI patients, 106 patients met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-four patients were females and 52 were males with a mean age of 68.2 years. Radiological iSAH progression was found in 2 of 106 (1.89) patients, and one of them was under antiplatelet therapy. No neurological deterioration was observed. Ten of 106 (9.4%) patients were under anticoagulation therapy, and 28 of 106 (26.4%) were under antiplatelet therapy.CONCLUSION: ISAH in mTBI seems to be a radiological stable entity over 72 h with no neurological deterioration. The clinical utility of a repeat head CT in such patients is questionable, considering its radiation exposure and cost. Regardless of anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy, neurologic observation and symptomatic treatment solely could be a reasonable alternative.",Excluded
1959,"Effectiveness of lead cap in radiation protection of head in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory Aims: Occupational head exposure of radiation was suggested to be associated with brain tumors in interventional cardiologists. The brain is of particular interest, because it is one of the least protected organs during interventional procedures. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the lead cap in radiation protection of the head and compare it with that of a ceiling mounted lead glass screen in a real life setting. Our secondary goal was to test the comfort and convenience of the lead cap when worn on a regular daily basis. Methods and Results: Radiation dose to the operator was recorded by the three dosimeters placed outside the lead cap, inside the cap and outside the apron at the level of trunk for a total of 18 months. Only the lead cap (Burkhart Roentgen International, St Petersburg, Florida, USA) but not the ceiling suspended protective glass screen was used during the first three months of measurement of radiation dose to the head. Later concomitant use of both protection devices was analysed. The dosimeter outside the cap recorded a dose of 2.77 mSv radiation when the ceiling mounted screen was not used during the first 3 months. The doses were 2.4 to 12.5 times higher in comparison to the measurements that were recorded when the ceiling suspended screen was used. However, a remarkable dose of radiation (ranged between 1.16-0.22 mSv) was received by the operators head despite the use of ceiling mounted screen. Yet, even without the protection of the ceiling mounted screen, the dose recorded by the dosimeter inside the lead cap during the first period was <0.1 mSv. As expected, the doses to the head recorded by the dosimeter inside the cap during the next 15 months period were also less than 0.1 mSv with the use of the ceiling mounted screen. Therefore, a cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless of the use of the screen. Conclusion(s): A cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence was much more protective than the mounted screen and reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless the use of the mounted screen. Although being a subjective conclusion, the operator regularly wearing the lead cap reported that the lead cap is reasonably comfortable and offers an acceptable wearing comfort when used on daily practice.",Excluded

2133,"Phase I/II trial of simultaneous whole-brain irradiation and dose-escalating topotecan for brain metastases BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Topotecan penetrates the blood-brain barrier and sensitizes tumor cells against radiation. A phase I/II dose-escalating trial of repetitive daily i. v. topotecan application simultaneously with whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) was conducted to estimate toxicity, maximum tolerated dose and survival in patients with inoperable brain metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 47 patients suffering from previously untreated brain metastases, topotecan was applied on a daily i. v. schedule simultaneously with WBRT (36 Gy/3-Gy fractions). The infusion schedule started at the beginning of WBRT and was discontinued during weekends. Each infusion was completed within 1-2 h before irradiation. In a dose-finding study, topotecan was escalated from 5 x 0.5 mg/m(2), 8 x 0.5 mg/m(2), 12 x 0.5 mg/m(2) to 12 x 0.6 mg/m(2).RESULTS: Altogether, 38/47 patients (81%) completed the prescribed schedule. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were dose-limiting. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 5/32 chemonaive patients (16%) and 7/15 patients (47%) with previous chemotherapy. At 12 x 0.6 mg/m(2), 2/4 patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia/thrombopenia. Nonhematologic toxicities were generally mild to moderate and unrelated to topotecan. Response evaluation was possible in 26/47 patients, overall response rate was 58% (CR [complete remission] 5/26, PR [partial remission] 10/26, NC [no change] 8/26). Median survival amounted to 5.1 months. In 15/42 patients (36%), brain metastases were the dominant cause of death.CONCLUSION: For a daily topotecan schedule simultaneous to WBRT, the maximum tolerated dose is 12 x 0.5 mg/m(2) in chemonaive patients. For chemo-pretreated patients, daily doses should be reduced to 0.4 mg/m(2). A phase III trial has now been started to find out whether WBRT + topotecan increases survival compared to WBRT alone.",Excluded

1716,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging as an evaluation of the response of brain metastases treated by stereotactic radiosurgery Background: Loss of tumor cell results in a relative increase in extracellular space that may lead to alteration of ADC. Our purpose was to see if the ADC could be used, rather than methods depending on changes in tumor size, to predict treatment success after treatment of brain metastases with SRS. Method(s): In a prospective study, the ADCs of 21 patients with 32 solid or solid-dominated brain metastases were taken before and 1 week, 1 month, and at 3-month intervals after SRS. Mean ADC values at the various time intervals were compared with each other to see whether or not the ADC might be used as an early indicator of treatment success or failure. Result(s): The mean pretreatment value of the ADC in the metastatic tumors was 1.05 +/- 0.12 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s (mean +/- SD). This value for the tumors rose significantly (P = .009) 7 days after SRS and continued to rise with time. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that 91% of these tumors had been controlled by the SRS. The ADC values in cystic/necrotic tumor tissue (2.13 +/- 0.18 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) were significantly (P < .001) higher than those in noncentral necrotic tumor tissue (1.61 +/- 0.14 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s). Conclusion(s): The ADC values might eventually be useful to evaluate treatment success-and in some patients, detected even at early time points-and to distinguish radiation-induced central necrosis from tumor regrowth in cases where other imagery is not definitive.

1720,"Properties of paired-pulse firing thresholds and the relationship with paired-pulse plasticity in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses A large variability of paired-pulse plasticity (PPP) has been reported in CA3-CA1 synapses, and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) has long been extensively used as a relative index of release probability (P(r)) from the presynaptic terminal. One of the most common ways of studying P(r) and PPP is to pass paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) through an electrode to fire an action potential (AP), which in turn opens Ca(2+) channels in the presynaptic boutons to evoke transmitter release. However, when the postsynaptic responses were elicited by electrical stimulations, the presynaptic APs were usually not monitored. The reliability of presynaptic activation, the difference of AP firing thresholds between the first and the second pulses of PPS, and its relationship with P(r) and PPP have been largely ignored. Here we show that the AP firing thresholds in the same CA3 pyramidal cells (axons) are obviously lower for the second pulses of the PPS than for the first pulses. When single (or small numbers of) presynaptic axons were stimulated by low-intensity PPS, a large variation in the postsynaptic response probability of the first pulses (P(res1)) and PPP was observed. Increasing stimulation intensities resulted in the conversion of a lower P(res1) and PPF to a higher P(res1) and paired-pulse depression. These results indicate that changes in the reliability of AP initiation by the first pulse of the PPS may account for the high variability of P(res1) and PPP observed in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, therefore PPF may not be a reliable index of P(r) .",Excluded

1744,"Multisensory plasticity in congenitally deaf mice: how are cortical areas functionally specified? The neocortex of congenitally deaf mice was examined using electrophysiological recording techniques combined with cortical myeloarchitecture. Our results indicate that relative activity patterns across sensory systems during development contribute to modality assignment of cortical fields as well as the size of cortical fields. In congenitally deaf mice, ""auditory cortex"" contained neurons that responded to somatosensory, visual, or both somatosensory and visual stimulation; the primary visual area contained a larger proportion of neurons that responded to somatosensory stimulation than in normal animals, and the primary visual area had significantly increased in size. Thus, cortical architecture and functional specification were de-correlated. When results are considered in the light of molecular studies and studies in which peripheral activity is altered in development, it becomes clear that similar types of changes to the neocortex, such as alterations in cortical field size, can be achieved in more than one way in the developing and evolving neocortex.",Excluded

Great heterogeneity in nature and function of mutated genes, variety of mutations for each of them, variability in phenotypic appearance and transmission modality contribute to make RP a still incurable disease. Translational research relies on appropriate animal models mimicking the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the human pathology. Here, we provide a systematic, morphological and functional analysis of Rho<sup>Tvrm4</sup>/Rho<sup>+</sup> rhodopsin mutant mice, originally described in 2010 and portraying several features of common forms of autosomal dominant RP caused by gain-of-function mutations. These mice undergo photoreceptor degeneration only when exposed briefly to strong, white light and allow controlled timing of induction of rod and cone death, which therefore can be elicited in adult animals, as observed in human RP. The option to control severity and retinal extent of the phenotype by regulating intensity and duration of the inducing light opens possibilities to exploit this model for multiple experimental purposes. Altogether, the unique features of this mutant make it an excellent resource for retinal degeneration research.",Excluded
1221,"Co-aggregation of ganglioside-containing membranes and alpha-synuclein Parkinson's disease (PD) is accompanied by the formation of Lewy bodies, whose main components are fibrils of the protein alpha-synuclein. These aggregates include membrane lipids, while little is known about the process of lipid/alpha- synuclein co-aggregation and its implications for fibril and Lewy body formation. Ganglioside lipids are abundant in neuronal membranes and have been found to accelerate fibril formation [1] and to accumulate in PD brains. We address the effects of ganglioside-phospholipid (GM3-POPC) model membranes on the dynamics (regarding the order parameter and the correlation time of C-H bond reorientation) and structure of co-aggregates with alpha-synuclein using polarization-transfer 13C solid-state NMR [2], wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) and cryogenic electron microscopy. 31P NMR powder patterns were recorded to monitor the lipid phase behavior and the spinning sidebands at 1250 Hz MAS were used to fit the chemical shift anisotropy before and after coaggregation. It was found that both lipids are co-assembled with alpha-synuclein with reduced headgroup and acyl chain mobility, and that the mobility of alpha-synuclein is modulated by the lipid-to-protein ratio and membrane composition. As the ganglioside content of membranes was increased the mobility of alanine residues is affected, implying a modulation of the fibril core which could impact the fibrillation propensity. These effects of co-aggregation on alpha-synuclein fibril mobility are currently being further investigated by us and raises questions on the specific lipid-protein interactions and the organization of lipids inside coaggregates.",Excluded
2451,"Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the adult rat CNS express myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) While the effects of high dose X-irradiation on mitotically active progenitor cells and remyelination are well-documented, its effects on myelinating oligodendrocytes are less clear, due in part to divergent views on their mitotic capacity. To examine the effect of X-irradiation on oligodendrocytes, the spinal cord of rats was exposed to 40 Gy of X-irradiation and the number of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors in the dorsal funiculi at T12 and L1 was determined by in situ hybridization using cRNA-probes for platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor (PDGFRalpha) (to identify oligodendrocyte progenitors), exon 3b of proteolipid protein (PLP) (to identify mature oligodendrocytes) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). X-irradiation resulted in no change in the number of PLP positive cells and no loss of myelin internodes, but caused an almost complete loss of PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, and a reduction in the number of MOG positive cells to a number similar to that found using the PLP exon 3b probe. Importantly, the number of radiation-sensitive MOG-expressing cells was similar to the number of PDGFRalpha positive cells. To determine if the radiation-sensitive MOG positive cells were the same population as the radiation sensitive PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, MOG and PDGFRalpha-expressing cells were isolated from the adult CNS using antibody coated magnetic beads. Twelve to thirteen percent of MOG positive cells were PDGFRalpha positive and nearly all the PDGFRa isolated cells were MOG and galactocerebroside positive. Double immunofluorescence revealed colocalization of NG2 and MOG on cells in the normal adult rat spinal cord. These results show that in situ in the adult rat spinal cord white matter oligodendrocyte progenitors are MOG positive and indicates that expression of MOG cannot be regarded a marker that only identifies mature myelin-supporting oligodendrocytes in tissue.",Included

SRT was planned on a linear accelerator, using volumetric modulated arc therapy. All ST were allowed including chemotherapy (CT), immunotherapy (IT), targeted therapy (TT) and hormonotherapy (HT). Treatment was considered to be concurrent if the timing between the drug administration and SRT did not exceed 1 month. Local control (LC), freedom for distant brain metastases (FFDBM), overall survival (OS) and radionecrosis (RN) were evaluated.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11.9 months (range 0.7-29.7), there was no significant difference between the two groups. However, patients who received concurrent IT (n = 30) had better 1-year LC, OS, FFDBM but a higher RN rate compared to patients who did not: 96% versus 78% (p = 0.02), 89% versus 77% (p = 0.02), 76% versus 53% (p = 0.004) and 80% versus 90% (p = 0.03), respectively. In multivariate analysis, concurrent IT (p = 0.022) and tumor volume < 2.07 cc (p = 0.039) were significantly correlated with improvement of LC.

This review will summarize the current state of the art in the management of facial paralysis and discuss the advances in nerve regeneration, facial reanimation, and use of novel biomaterials. This review includes surgical innovations in reinnervation and reanimation as well as progress with bioelectrical interfaces. RECENT FINDINGS: The last decade has witnessed major advances in the understanding of nerve injury and approaches for management. Key innovations include strategies to accelerate nerve regeneration, provide tissue-engineered constructs that may replace nonfunctional nerves, approaches to influence axonal guidance, limiting of donor-site morbidity, and optimization of functional outcomes. Approaches to muscle transfer continue to evolve, and new technologies allow for electrical nerve stimulation and use of artificial tissues. SUMMARY: The fields of biomedical engineering and facial reanimation increasingly intersect, with innovative surgical approaches complementing a growing array of tissue engineering tools. The goal of treatment remains the predictable restoration of natural facial movement, with acceptable morbidity and long-term stability. Advances in bioelectrical interfaces and nanotechnology hold promise for widening the window for successful treatment intervention and for restoring both lost neural inputs and muscle function.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonists may have neuroprotective potential in CNS disorders. In a study examining PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone (PIO) in individuals with cocaine and alcohol use disorder (CUD + AUD), we tested the hypothesis that PIO (vs PLC) would improve WM integrity from pre- to post-treatment. Method(s): Subjects received PIO 45mg or PLC and behavioral therapy for 12 weeks of treatment. Before (week 0) and after (week 12) medication treatment, all participants were scanned under MRI and DTI protocols. Eighteen participants (8 PIO, 10 PLC) completed all 12 weeks of treatment and provided both week 0 and week 12 scans. Result(s): PIO and PLC subjects were not significantly different in demographics.

Method(s): From December, 2001 to February, 2013, we have treated a total of 35 patients with recurrent HNC by means of 52 applications of BNCT. Histopathologically, there were 24 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 7 with salivary gland carcinomas and 4 with sarcomas. All of them had received standard therapy and subsequently developed recurrent disease for which there were no other treatment options. All of the patients received intravenously either a combination of two boron containing drugs, sodium borocaptate (BSH, 5g) and boronophenylalanine (BPA, 250mg/kg) or BPA (500mg/kg) alone. In this report we will summarize the clinical results and outcomes of 35 patients with HNC who had received BNCT at either the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURI) or the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) nuclear reactor.

However, iterative radiological controls inherent to this technique are responsible for a significant increase in exposure to ionizing radiation for the surgeon. New techniques for radiological guidance (O-arm navigation-assisted) would overcome this drawback, but this remains unproven.OBJECTIVES: To analyze the exposure of the surgeon to intraoperative X-ray during a MIS TLIF under fluoroscopy and under O-arm navigation-assisted.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the University Hospital of Lille from February to May 2013. Twelve patients underwent a MIS TLIF for the treatment of low-grade spondylolisthesis; six under standard fluoroscopy (group 1) and six under O-arm system (group 2). Passive dosimeters (rings and glasses) and active dosimeters for thorax were used to measure the radiation exposure of the surgeon.RESULTS: For group 1, the average time of fluoroscopy was 3.718 minutes (3.13-4.56) while no radioscopy was perform on group 2. For the first group, the average exposure dose was 12 muSv (5-20 muSv) on the thorax, 1168 muSv (510-2790 muSv) on the main hand and 179 muSv (103-486 muSv) on the lens.

In the perfusion MRI, four regions of interest (ROIs) were identified and average values were calculated. A reference ROI of the same size was defined in the contralateral white matter to obtain the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). After coregistering the PET images with the MRI, we measured the maximum uptake values of the lesion and of the contralateral cerebral white matter as reference area to calculate the L(max)/R(max) ratio.RESULTS: The rCBV was higher in the recurrence group than in the necrosis group (p=0.010). There was no difference between groups in terms of the L(max)/R(max) ratio as derived from the (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET.CONCLUSION: A quantitative rCBV as calculated from a perfusion MRI scan might be superior to the L(max)/R(max) ratio as derived from (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET in order to distinguish a recurrence of high-grade glioma from radiation necrosis.",Excluded
1346,"Influence of surface pattern and sterilisation of solvent-cast films for peripheral nerve guidance INTRODUCTION : Damage to peripheral nerves can result in considerable morbidity and loss of function. Poly-(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and PCL/poly-(D,L-lactic acid) (PLA) blend nerve guidance conduits are a promising alternative to autologous nerve grafts in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury1. The surface morphology of scaffolds is known to influence their physical properties and cell behaviour. Yet, as scaffolds progress further towards clinical trials, it is imperative that they are subjected to/and capable of withstanding approved sterilisation methods, such as gamma irradiation, without causing detrimental effects to the material physical properties and/or cell response. This study investigates how surface patterns affect PCL films and aims to assess whether PCL/PLA blend scaffolds are able to withstand gamma irradiation sufficient for medical sterilisation. METHOD(S): PCL and PCL/PLA (4:1 w/w) blend solutions were prepared using dichloromethane (3% w/v). Smooth, pitted and micro-grooved PCL films were cast and imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while tensile testing was used to quantify their mechanical properties (Instron 1122, load cell 0.010 kN). NG108-15 cells were cultured up to 14 days on the various PCL film surfaces before fluorescence and SEM imaging were performed both to confirm biocompatibility and observe cell behaviour. PCL/PLA blend films will be sterilised at 7 incremental doses of gamma radiation (15-45 kGy) (Isotron). Mechanical testing, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography will be utilised to evaluate any changes in material properties or structure in comparison to unirradiated control samples. RESULT(S): The mean thickness of all types of solvent-cast film was less than 100 mum. The average porosity of the pitted PCL films was 53% with 2.1+/-0.5 mum diameter pits. Smooth films were significantly stronger, with greater modulus and strain (Table 1*p<0.01). NG108-15 cells attached and proliferated on the PCL films in vitro up to 14 days. However, only on the grooved samples did cells display organisation, demonstrating alignment in the same orientation as the grooves (Fig. 1). (Table presented) Discussion & CONCLUSION(S): These findings support the use of solvent cast PCL films for fabricating nerve guides. Pits in the surface of the inner lumen are beneficial in cell growth and grooved surfaces enable the alignment of neurons. In this work all patterned surfaces had sufficient tensile strength to function as nerve conduits. PCL/PLA blended films were tested to see whether they would withstand medical-grade sterilisation. It is hypothesised that the polymer films will not be significantly affected by gamma irradiation.",Excluded
1853,"Identification of novel p53 target genes in ionizing radiation response The tumor suppressor p53 plays an essential role in cellular adaptation to stress. In response to ionizing radiation, p53 regulates the transcription of genes in a diverse set of pathways including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Previously, we identified by microarray analysis a set of genes that are transcriptionally activated or repressed in response to radiation exposure. In this study, we use computational methods and molecular techniques, including location analysis (ChIP-on-chip assay), to identify ionizing radiation-responsive genes that are directly regulated by p53. Among the 489 ionizing radiation-responsive genes examined, 38 genes were found to be p53 targets. Some of these genes are previously known to be directly regulated by p53 whereas others are novel p53 targets. We further showed that the novel p53 target genes are transcriptionally regulated by p53. The binding of p53 to promoters of target genes correlated with increased transcript levels of these genes in cells with functional p53. However, p53 binding and subsequent transcriptional activation of these target genes were significantly diminished in cells with mutant p53 and in cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia, which have impaired p53 activation following ionizing radiation exposure. Identification and characterization of ionizing radiation-responsive p53 target genes extend our knowledge of the diverse role that p53 plays in the DNA damage response.",Excluded

The survival of UV-irradiated HSV-1 was increased as a result of UV- or X-preirradiation of both AT and normal cells. This result contrasts with our previous observation showing that contrary to normal cells AT cells are deficient for ER of a single-stranded DNA parvovirus. A difference between the molecular processes underlying ER of single- and double-stranded DNA viruses might explain these results.,Excluded

1390,"Superficial anatomy of the neonatal cerebrum - an ultrasonographic roadmap Neurosonography is an essential imaging modality for assessing the neonatal brain, particularly as a screening tool to evaluate intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus and periventricular leukomalacia. The primary advantages of neurosonography include portability, accessibility and lack of ionizing radiation. Its main limitations are intrinsic operator dependence and the need for an open fontanelle. Neurosonographic imaging acquisition is typically performed by placing a sector transducer over the anterior fontanelle and following sagittal and coronal sweeps. The sensitivity of neurosonography has markedly improved thanks to the adoption of modern imaging equipment, the use of dedicated head probes, and the employment of advanced diagnostic US techniques. These developments have facilitated more descriptive identification of specific cerebral anatomical details, improving understanding of the cerebral anatomy by conventional US. Such knowledge is fundamental for enhanced diagnostic sensitivity and is a key to understanding pathological states. Furthermore, familiarity with normal anatomy is crucial for understanding pathological states. Our primary goal in this review was to supplement these technological developments with a roadmap to the cerebral landscape. We accomplish this by presenting a systematic approach to using routine US for consistent identification of the most crucial cerebral landmarks, reviewing their relationship with adjacent structures, and briefly describing their primary function.",Excluded

2041,"Radiation as a local ablative therapy option for oligoprogressive EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with osimertinib Purpose/Objective(s): Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved response rate and survival in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their efficacy is limited by acquired resistance and disease progression. Local ablative therapy (LAT) has shown a survival benefit in patients with oligometastatic disease in retrospective studies. At our institution, we are conducting a prospective single-arm Phase 2 study of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI. Following LAT to the sites of progression with either radiation or surgery, patients are re-initiated on osimertinib. The primary endpoints are safety, tolerability, and efficacy of re-initiation of osimertinib, as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS). We hypothesize that osimertinib and radiation can be safely administered sequentially, and that LAT followed by re-initiation of osimertinib will result in improved PFS. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with no prior EGFR-TKI exposure (cohort 1) or progression after 1st/2nd generation EGFR-TKIs with acquired T790M mutation (cohort 2) receive osimertinib. Upon progression, eligible patients with <=5 progressing sites undergo LAT by either radiation therapy or surgery, then resume osimertinib until further disease progression. Patients previously treated with osimertinib with disease progression who qualify for LAT are also eligible (cohort 3). Prior to beginning radiation, patients must be off osimertinib for at least 2 wks, and total time off osimertinib must be less than 8 wks. Result(s): Fifteen patients with a median age of 57 (range 36-71) were enrolled between 4/2016 and 1/2017 (cohorts 1/2/3: 9/3/3 patients). Overall, treatment has been well tolerated, with rash, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and alanine transaminase elevation the most common adverse events (AEs). Grade 3-4 AEs were observed in 4 (27%) patients. Objective response rates among evaluable patients prior to LAT in cohorts 1 and 2 were 71% (5/7) and 100% (2/2), respectively. Median PFS was 6.8 mo (95% CI: 3.4 mo-undefined) in cohort 1; there have been no progressions in cohort 2. To date, 2/5 patients receiving LAT have received radiation (both in cohort 3). One patient received 5 Gy x 5 to 2 lung lesions, while the other received 24 Gy and 18 Gy by stereotactic radiosurgery to 2 brain metastases. Additional endpoints include assessment of mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib by multi-omics analyses of tumor, blood, and saliva; results from these analyses will also be presented. Conclusion(s): Oligoprogressive disease can be safely treated with LAT, including radiation therapy, in patients with limited metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC after EGFR-TKI therapy. This approach could potentially prevent premature switching to other, less-effective systemic therapies by maximizing the duration and efficacy of EGFR-TKI treatment in selected patients.",Excluded
1209,"Stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife radiosurgery of cystic brain metastasis Object. Treatment options for patients with brain metastasis include tumor resection, whole-brain radiation therapy, and radiosurgery. A single treatment is not useful in cases of multiple tumors, of which at least 1 is a cystic tumor. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in the treatment of cystic brain metastasis. Methods. Between January 2001 and November 2005, 680 consecutive patients with brain metastases underwent GKS at our hospital, 30 of whom were included in this study (18 males and 12 females, mean age 60.6 +/- 11 years, range 38-75 years). Inclusion criteria were: 1) no prior whole-brain radiation therapy or resection procedure; 2) a maximum of 4 lesions on preoperative MR imaging; 3) at least 1 cystic lesion; 4) a Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 70; and 5) histological diagnosis of a malignant tumor. Results. Non-small cell lung carcinoma was the primary cancer in most patients (19 patients [63.3%]). A single metastasis was present in 13 patients (43.3%). There was a total of 81 tumors, 33 of which were cystic. Ten patients (33.3%) were in recursive partitioning analysis Class I, and 20 (66.6%) were in Class II. Before drainage the mean tumor volume was 21.8 ml (range 3.8-68 ml); before GKS the mean tumor volume was 10.1 ml (range 1.2-32 ml). The mean prescription dose to the tumor margin was 19.5 Gy (range 12-25 Gy). Overall median patient survival was 15 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 54.7% (95% confidence interval 45.3-64.1%) and 34.2% (95% confidence interval 23.1-45.3%). Local tumor control was achieved in 91.3% of the patients.

1943,"Test of the paired-flash electroretinographic method in mice lacking b-waves Previous studies of rod photoreceptors in vivo have employed a paired-flash electroretinographic (ERG) technique to determine rod response properties. To test whether absence versus presence of the ERG b-wave affects the photoreceptor response derived by the paired-flash method, we examined paired-flash-derived responses obtained from nob mice, a mutant strain with a defect in signal transduction between photoreceptors and ON bipolar cells that causes a lack of the b-wave. Normal littermates of the nob mice served as controls. The normalized amplitude-intensity relation of the derived response determined in nob mice at the near-peak time of 86 ms was similar to that determined for the controls. The full time course of the derived rod response was obtained for test flash strengths ranging from 0.11 to 17.38 scotopic cd s m(-2) (sc cd s m(-2)). Time-course data obtained from nob and control mice exhibited significant but generally modest differences. With saturating test flash strengths, half-recovery times for the derived response of nob versus control mice differed by approximately 60 ms or less about the combined (nob and control) average respective values. Time course data also were obtained before versus after intravitreal injection of L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB) (which blocks transmission from photoreceptors to depolarizing bipolar cells) and of cis 2,3-piperidine dicarboxylic acid (PDA) (which blocks transmission to OFF bipolar cells, and to horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells). Neither APB nor PDA substantially affected derived responses obtained from nob or control mice. The results provide quantitative information on the effect of b-wave removal on the paired-flash-derived response in mouse. They argue against a substantial skewing effect of the b-wave on the paired-flash-derived response obtained in normal mice and are consistent with the notion that, to good approximation, this derived response represents the isolated flash response of the photoreceptors in both nob and normal mice.",Excluded
1871,"Preclinical MRI reveals anti-VEGF therapy mitigates radiation necrosis Purpose: Radiation necrosis, a severe but late occurring injury to normal tissue within and surrounding a radiation treatment field, has been described as a slow, continuous process in which increased levels of VEGF-A lead to breakdown of the blood brain barrier [1]. Thus, a strategy that involves blocking VEGF-A from reaching capillaries and repairing ""leaky"" capillaries is a possible therapeutic approach for radiation necrosis. In this work, in concert with a novel mouse model of radiation necrosis [2], the therapeutic effects of the humanized anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech) and the murine anti-VEGF antibody B20-4.1.1 (Genentech) are monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. Method(s): Hemispheric irradiation of mouse brain was performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife PerfexionTM (GK), a state-of-the-art unit used for stereotactic irradiation of patients with malignant brain tumors. Three cohorts of 7-8 week old female mice (n=5) were irradiated with a single 60-Gy dose (50% isodose) of GK radiation. At this dose, the onset of radiation necrosis typically occurs 3-4 weeks post-irradiation. Mouse cohort #1 was an irradiated but untreated control; cohort #2 received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, twice weekly) from 3-to-10 weeks post-irradiation; cohort #3 received B20- 4.1.1 (10 mg/kg, twice weekly) from 4-to-13 weeks post-irradiation. Mice were imaged from 3-to-10 weeks post-irradiation, using an Agilent/Varian DirectDriveTM 4.7-T small-animal MR scanner. Result(s): The MRI-derived volumes of radiation necrosis for control, bevacizumab-treated, and B20-4.1.1-treated mice are plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of time post-irradiation. Both anti-VEGF antibodies slow the overall rate of progression (p<0.0001, week 10). Considering the initial 3-7 week period postirradiation, bevacizumab has the same mitigative effect as B20-4.1.1 (p = 0.8, week 7). However, for the latter 3-week period (7-10 weeks post-irradiation), radiation-induced necrosis developed at a higher rate than in the B20-4.1.1-treated cohort (p<0.0001, week 10), indicating that the mitigative effect of bevacizumab was weaker than B20-4.1.1 in the late period following the initiation of treatment. Histology results support the MR data. The irradiated hemispheres of the control mice demonstrated many of the classic histologic features of radiation necrosis. In contrast, the irradiated hemisphere of the bevacizumab-treated mouse showed only modest tissue damage and the irradiated hemisphere of the B20-4.1.1-treated mouse displayed no visible tissue damage. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate a significant mitigative effect of bevacizumab and B20-4.1.1 in a mouse model of radiation necrosis, an effect also observed recently in a group of brain-tumor patients treated with bevacizumab [3]. Efforts to verify the mechanism of action of bevacizumab and B20-4.1.1 in the treatment of radiation necrosis in the mouse model are ongoing. (Graph presented).",Excluded

Reapplication of aCTL immunoselective pressure to the IR clones, displaying a partial regain in sensitivity to aCTL after removal of the selective pressure, restored the resistance. The IR variants exhibited cross-resistance to non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted effector cells and gamma-irradiation, but not to carmustine. The IR clones were characterized for factors that might contribute to the immunoresistance. The aCTL adhesion to extracellular matrix extracts derived from either the IR clones or the parental cells was similar and not impaired. Furthermore, aCTL binding to parental cells and IR clones was equal. Down-regulation of the cell recognition molecules, class I HLA or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), that would inhibit their recognition by aCTL was not observed on the IR clones. The down-regulation of Fas by the IR clones correlated with their resistance to FasL-induced apoptosis. HLA-G or FasL that might provide an immunotolerant environment or provide a means of counterattack to aCTL, respectively, were not associated with the IR phenotype. The aCTL, coincubated with the IR clones and parental cells, displayed up-regulation of multiple secreted cytokines. A significant up-regulation of bioactive transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta was observed in the IR clones compared with the parental cells. These data suggest that increased secretion of bioactive TGF-beta may inhibit aCTL lysis of the IR clones. Disruption of the TGF-beta signaling pathway may circumvent the resistance.",Excluded
1773,"Chemical stimulation of rat retinal neurons: feasibility of an epiretinal neurotransmitter-based prosthesis OBJECTIVE: No cure currently exists for photoreceptor degenerative diseases, which cause partial or total blindness in millions of people worldwide. Electrical retinal prostheses have been developed by several groups with the goal of restoring vision lost to these diseases, but electrical stimulation has limitations. It excites both somas and axons, activating retinal pathways nonphysiologically, and limits spatial resolution because of current spread. Chemical stimulation of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) using the neurotransmitter glutamate has been suggested as an alternative to electrical stimulation with some significant advantages. However, sufficient scientific data to support developing a chemical-based retinal prosthesis is lacking. The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a neurotransmitter-based retinal prosthesis and determine therapeutic stimulation parameters.APPROACH: We injected controlled amounts of glutamate into rat retinas from the epiretinal side ex vivo via micropipettes using a pressure injection system and recorded RGC responses with a multielectrode array. Responsive units were identified using a spike rate threshold of 3 Hz.MAIN RESULTS: We recorded both somal and axonal units and demonstrated successful glutamatergic stimulation across different RGC subtypes. Analyses show that exogenous glutamate acts on RGC synapses similar to endogenous glutamate and, unlike electrical prostheses, stimulates only RGC somata. The spatial spread of glutamate stimulation was = 290 mum from the injection site, comparable to current electrical prostheses. Further, the glutamate injections produced spatially differential responses in OFF, ON, and ON-OFF RGC subtypes, suggesting that differential stimulation of the OFF and ON systems may be possible. A temporal resolution of 3.2 Hz was obtained, which is a rate suitable for spatial vision.SIGNIFICANCE: We provide strong support for the feasibility of an epiretinal neurotransmitter-based retinal prosthesis. Our findings suggest that chemical stimulation of RGCs is a viable alternative to electrical stimulation and could offer distinct advantages such as the selective stimulation of RGC somata.",Excluded

1449,"The role of systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases from small-cell lung cancer Brain is the most common site of metastatic spread in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Approximately 10% of SCLC patients have brain metastases (BM) already at diagnosis and an additional 40% will develop central nervous system (CNS) involvement during their disease course. Although whole brain radiotherapy and corticosteroids is considered the treatment of choice, accumulating evidence suggests that systemic chemotherapy may also play an important role. The concept of the brain as a pharmacologic sanctuary site for established metastases is in contrast with recent clinical observations of frequent BM responses with systemic chemotherapy. During the last decade, several reports about the effect of systemic chemotherapy on BM from SCLC have been published. Pooled data from five studies report 66% response rate (RR) in 64 patients with initial BM. In addition, an average RR of 36% is derived from five studies including 135 patients with delayed BM treated with systemic single agent chemotherapy. Among new drugs with activity in patients with SCLC brain metastases, camptothecin analog topotecan is one of the most promising with a 52% RR. Although whole brain radiation remains the standard treatment of established BM in SCLC there is an emerging role for systemic chemotherapy, particularly with the use of new active drugs as part of combined modality treatments.

We applied static magnetic fields to the neurons and analyzed the direction and morphology of newly formed neuronal processes. In the presence of the magnetic field, neurites grew in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field, as revealed by the higher orientation index of neurites grown under the magnetic field compared to that of the neurites grown in the absence of the magnetic field. The neurites parallel to the magnetic field appeared to be dystrophic, beaded or thickened, suggesting that they would hinder further elongation processes. The co-localized areas of microtubules and actin filaments were arranged into the vertical axis to the magnetic field, while the levels of neurofilament and synaptotagmin were not altered.

Here we report the arrest of spontaneous seizures using a real-time, closed-loop, response system and in vivo optogenetics in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Either optogenetic inhibition of excitatory principal cells, or activation of a subpopulation of GABAergic cells representing <5% of hippocampal neurons, stops seizures rapidly upon light application.

These are breast irradiation of breast conserving therapy,post mastectomy regional irradiation,irradiation for regional lymph nodes recurrence,breast irradiation of inoperable locally advanced cases,palliative irradiation of brain metastasis,bone metastasis and so on. The relationship among radiotherapy,surgery and systemic therapy has to be considered in those situations.In breast conserving therapy, the usefulness of breast irradiation is well established. Otherwise, a local controllability depend on a grade of residual tumor cell has not been understand. The authors conducted the survey of 941 cases of positive surgical margins and found that doses more than 60 Gy has a tendency for better local control in post menopausal cases. To reduce patient's burden,3 weeks short course irradiation (Canadian protocol) or accelerated partial breast irradiation have been introduced in breast irradiation. A subgroup which has no need to irradiate to conserving breast had not been identified. The timing between postoperative chemotherapy and irradiation is another point that has to be considered. To reduce distant metastasis,chemotherapy first has been considered better. As for post mastectomy regional irradiation, improvement of local and systemic control has been widely known these days. A timing of systemic therapy and irradiation is a point has to consider. In inoperable or far advanced T 4 tumors, breast irradiation with concurrent chemotherapy must be considered in stead of surgery. We have to know a big shortage in Japanese cancer treatment situation that we have few radiation oncologists or medical physicists in Japan. We have to educate those specialists to catch up with increasing cancer patients.",Excluded
1685,"Boron Neutron Capture Therapy in the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme: The First Experiences in the Czech Republic. [Slovak] Background. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, its treatment remains unsatisfactory with very limited overall survival. In the year 2001, in cooperation with Department of Neurosurgery, Nemocnice Na Homolce and Nuclear Research Institute in Rez, we have started to treat glioblastoma patients with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Methods and Results. Cells of malignant brain tumors, especially that of glioblastomas, are able to accumulate boron compounds. If BNCT should be successful, it is necessary to reach selective accumulation of sufficient amount of 10B in the tumor and low accumulation in the normal brain tissue. After BSH administration, radiation with low energy thermal neutrons is delivered. It results in nuclear capture and fission reactions with subsequent selective damage of tumor cells. At the time of analysis 9 patients have been enrolled. Therapy was completed in 5 patients. Treatment has been very well tolerated. We observed minimal acute toxicity associated with radiation and no laboratory abnormalities after administrations of BSH. Unfortunately treatment results were quite unsatisfactory. The median time to progression and overall survival were shorter then expected with conventional treatment. Conclusions. BNCT is very well tolerated with only a modest toxicity. In contrast to standard radiation, BNCT patients receive only one dose of radiation. Nevertheless, in this small pilot study first results were inferior when compared either to outcomes of conventional therapy or to results reported from other BNCT groups. It might be explained that lower dose of radiation had been used. Further study will show whether the higher dose radiation can improve treatment results.",Excluded

We evaluated the efficacy of CT and RT in patients with IDH mutant, 1p19q-noncodeleted secondary high-grade astrocytoma (sHGA) WHO grades III and IV. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment data from 109 patients with sHGA grades III and IV, developed from histologically confirmed low-grade astrocytoma grade II were retrospectively analyzed. IDH mutation-, 1p19q/codeletion- and MGMT-promoter methylation status were evaluable in all patients. Progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) in relation to adjuvant treatment modalities and molecular profiling were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULT(S): Out of 109 patients, 88 patients (80.7%) harbored an IDH1 or 2 mutations, 30 patients a 1p19q-codeletion (27.5%), and 63 patients (57.8%) exhibited a methylated MGMT-promoter status. During the follow-up time 57 patients (52.2%) died. The postsurgical treatment for the 88 IDH mutant sHGA included: RT alone in 17 patients (19.3%), a combined RT and CT (RCT) in 48 patients (54.5%) and CT alone in 20 patients (22.7%). 3 patients did not receive any adjuvant treatment due to bad neurological conditions. At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, the median OS of all IDH mutant sHGA was 5.67 years (1.9-17.4 years). The OS in patients who received RCT was 6.4 years, which is significantly longer compared with those who underwent RT alone (1.2 years, hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.32-0.51. p = 0.011). After including only IDH mutant sHGA patients without a 1p19q-codeletion, the Kaplan-Meier curves estimates a significantly improved OS in the RCT cohort (33 patients) in comparison to patients who received RT alone (10 patients) (6.4 vs 1.2 years, hazard ratio 0.4, 95% CI 0.34-0.6, p= 0.022).

The color of the background light was changed with 29 interference filters (400-700 nm). Waveforms were analyzed by means of principal component analysis to investigate interaction between the short-wavelength cone and other systems. With the same test lights, responses were also recorded during dark adaptation after 20,000-lux full bleach. The shape of the short-wavelength cone electroretinogram changed as a function of the wavelength of monochromatic background light. The change was clearer around 500-nm background light, to which the rod system is highly sensitive. Further, short-wavelength cone responses developed during the first 15 min in the dark; however, they became smaller with the recovery of the rod system. These findings suggest that there is interaction between the short-wavelength cone and rod systems. In addition, the results of waveform analysis confirmed the interaction between the long-wavelength and middle-wavelength cone systems.",Excluded

The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 1-72). We investigated the subjective and objective characteristics of the extrapulmonary masses, redelineated the origin tissue of each on the treatment planning computed tomography scan, and generated dose-volume histograms.RESULTS: In 9 patients (2.4%), extrapulmonary masses were found 3-36 months (median, 14) after irradiation. Coexisting swelling occurred in 3 patients, chest pain in 2, thumb numbness in 1, and arm edema in 1 patient. Extrapulmonary masses occurred in 5 (5.4%) of 92 and 4 (1.4%) of 287 patients irradiated with a 62.5-Gy and 48.0-Gy isocenter dose, respectively. The mean and maximal dose to the origin tissue was 25.8-53.9 Gy (median, 43.7) and 47.5-62.5 Gy (median, 50.2), respectively. In 5 of 9 patients, the standardized uptake values on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography was 1.8-2.8 (median, 2.2). Percutaneous needle biopsy was performed in 3 patients, and all the specimens showed benign fibrotic changes without malignant cells.CONCLUSION: All patients should be carefully followed after stereotactic body radiotherapy. The findings of any new lesion should prompt an assessment for radiation-induced extrapulmonary fibrosis before an immediate diagnosis of recurrence is made. Careful beam-shape modification and dose prescription near the thoracic outlet are required to prevent forearm neuropathy and lymphedema.",Excluded
1670,"Ratiometric calcium concentration estimation using LED excitation during mechanotransduction in single sensory neurons In a previous study using Oregon Green BAPTA-1 fluorescence we found that intracellular calcium concentration in spider mechanoreceptor neurons rose during mechanical stimulation. We also showed that calcium elevation required the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels by action potentials, and could not be produced by the receptor potential alone. While evidence for mechanisms of calcium elevation in these neurons was clear, our estimates of actual calcium concentration depended on properties of the fluorescent dye in the neuron cytoplasm that could not be verified. We have now developed a method for ratiometric estimation of calcium concentration in these neurons using Fura Red dye, excitation by two light emitting diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths, and an avalanche photodiode fluorescence detector. The method is simple and economical to implement, allows concentration changes to be measured in the millisecond time range, and could easily be applied to a wide range of preparations. Resting calcium concentration in these neurons was about 70nM and rose to a maximum of about 400nM at firing rates above 20 action potentials per second.",Excluded
1677,"Localization of neuropeptide Y receptor Y5 mRNA in the guinea pig brain by in situ hybridization Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has prominent stimulatory effects on food intake in virtually all animals that have been studied. In mammals, the effect is primarily mediated by receptors Y1 and Y5, which seem to contribute to different aspects of feeding behavior in guinea pigs and rats/mice. Interestingly, differences in receptor distribution among mammalian species have been reported. To get a broader perspective on the role of Y5, we describe here studies of guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), a species which due to its phylogenetic position in the mammalian radiation is an interesting complement to previous studies in rat and mouse. Guinea pig brain sections were hybridized with two <sup>35</sup>S-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to Y5 mRNA. The highest expression levels of Y5 mRNA were observed in the hippocampus and several hypothalamic and brain stem nuclei implicated in the regulation of feeding, such as the paraventricular, arcuate and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei. This contrasts with autoradiography studies that detected low Y5-like binding in these areas, a discrepancy observed also in rat and human. Y5 mRNA expression was also seen in the striatum, in great contrast to mouse and rat. Taken together, these data show that Y5 mRNA distribution displays some interesting species differences, but that its expression in feeding centers seems to be essentially conserved among mammals, adding further support for an important role in food intake.

1277,"Shifting and scaling adaptation to dynamic stimuli in somatosensory cortex Recent reports have shown that responses of midbrain neurons in the guinea pig rapidly shift the dynamic range of their responses to track changes in the statistics of ongoing sound-level distributions. This results in an increased coding accuracy for the most commonly occurring stimulus intensities. To investigate whether this type of adaptation might also be found in other sensory modalities, we characterized the intensity-response functions of neurons in rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to continuous sinusoidal vibration of the whiskers with amplitudes that were changed every 40 ms. Vibration amplitudes were selected randomly such that there was an 80% chance for the amplitude to be drawn from a relatively narrow 'high-probability region' (HPR). Stimulus mean and variance were then manipulated by shifting or widening the HPR. We found that rat S1 neurons adapt to shifts of the HPR mainly by shifting their thresholds, and to changes in HPR width by changing the slope of their rate-level curves. Using realistic single-neuron models, we go on to show that after-hyperpolarizing currents, such as those carried by K(Ca)(2+) channels, may be responsible for the threshold shifts, but not the slope changes.",Excluded

The method implemented involved 5 x 6 Gy and 5 x 8 Gy, Monday to Friday 6 MV photons. By unilateral irradiation, the contralateral parotid gland served as a control. Although irradiation diminished the acinar cell density in light microscopic sections from 75 to 32% after 5 x 8 Gy of irradiation, ultrastructural morphometry could not detect any statistically significant differences in acinar cell size, nuclear size, nuclear density, granule area, mean granule size, or granule density. In general, greater differences were seen between rats receiving 30 or 40 Gy, on both the irradiated and the control size, than between the irradiated side and the control side. This was interpreted as due to differences in the nutritional state of the animals. This analysis concluded that individual acinar cells that survive irradiation seem not to be damaged in the long term when evaluated at the ultrastructural level.

Methods A total of 955 brain CT examinations performed for minor head injuries were randomly retrospectively selected. Medical records were assessed for the following parameters: demographics, cause of head trauma, and referring physician's seniority and specialty. For each CT scan, it was determined whether the CT referral met the CCHR criteria. The CT interpretations of patients under 65 years of age were evaluated to assess the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the CCHR criteria. Results A total of 104 examinations (10.9%) were not indicated according to the CCHR, but in patients younger than 65 years, 104 of 279 examinations (37.3%) were not indicated. Neurologists conducted more unwarranted CT studies (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; P = .011), whereas surgeons tended to order fewer studies (OR, 0.676; P = .126). There was no statistically significant difference between the seniority of the referring physician and over-referral (P = .181). Four-wheel motor vehicle accidents (OR, 2.789; P = .001) and a hit on the head by an object (OR, 2.843; P = .006) were associated with a higher rate of nonindicated CT examinations. The CCHR had sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% for either brain hemorrhage or fractures. Conclusions Overuse of CT examinations for minor head injuries was demonstrated, especially in young patients, with an excess of 37.3%. Contributing factors are referring physician specialty and injury mechanism. Analysis of overuse causes can be implemented for education programs and for computerized referring protocols.

Histology included anaplastic astrocytoma in 11 patients and glioblastoma multiforme in 37 patients. Radiation was given at 1.2 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day, for a total dose of 72 Gy, with a reduction in field size after 52.8 Gy. Four weeks after completion of hyperfractionated radiation therapy multiagent chemotherapy was introduced with bischlorethyl nitrosourea (BCNU) 50 mg/m2, days 1-3, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (max. 2 mg), day 1, procarbazine 50 mg/m2, days 1-7 and cisplatin 20 mg/m2, days 1-3. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks to a maximum of six cycles or until tumor progression was noted.RESULTS: Median survival time for all patients was 52 weeks (range, 16-185 weeks) and median time to tumor progression was 30.5 weeks (range, 12-131 weeks). Besides age, histology, performance status, and extent of surgery, interfraction interval and location of tumor influenced survival in glioblastoma multiforms patients on univariate analysis: Patients treated with shorter intervals (4.5-5 h) did better than those treated with longer intervals (5.5-6 h); also, glioblastoma multiforme patients with frontal tumors did better than those with tumors of the other locations. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the performance status, interfraction interval, and tumor location were significant prognostic factors in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Acute toxicity was mild. No cases of brain necroses were observed.CONCLUSION: Hyperfractionated radiation therapy followed by multiagent chemotherapy was well tolerated with mild acute and virtually no late toxicity.

2029,"Analysis of the feeding motor pattern in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis: photoinactivation of axonally stained pattern-generating interneurons We have photoinactivated identified feeding interneurons known as N1 and N2 neurons. These are pattern-generating neurons that are active in the protraction of the radula and rasping phases, respectively, of the feeding cycle of the pond snail. The N1 or N2 feeding interneurons in the buccal ganglia were filled with the fluorescent dye 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF) from the cut end of the nerve that contains their axon. Filling the cerebrobuccal connective (N = 151) stained just one N1 cell in the contralateral buccal ganglion. Filling the postbuccal nerve stained neurons symmetrically in both buccal ganglia (N = 75): only one labeled cell in each ganglion is an N2 interneuron. The feeding rhythm was evoked by depolarizing a modulatory neuron, the SO, located in the buccal ganglia. The axonally filled N1 interneuron was irradiated at its axon in the buccal commissure with blue laser light (intensity of 0.5 MW.m-2). Irradiation of just one N1 completely blocked the feeding rhythm (seven preparations). In seven further preparations, N1 ablation slowed the SO-driven feeding rhythm and weakened the N1 input to the feeding neurons. Irradiation of the cell bodies of both the filled left and right N2 interneurons killed the cells but did not produce any consistent change in the feeding rate (15 preparations). The feeding interneurons and motoneurons still showed the characteristic N2 phase synaptic inputs, so more, as yet unidentified, N2 neurons must be located in other parts of the buccal ganglia. We conclude that the participation of the identified N1 interneurons is essential for the normal feeding pattern while other, still to be identified N2 neurons must be present and must contribute to the feeding rhythm. We suggest that the extra redundancy of the N2 network may be related to the greater necessity of sensory feedback control during rasping than during protraction of the radula.",Excluded

Taking advantage of the system's larger number of sources and detectors, we explored the spatiotemporal patterns of physiological signals during rest. These physiological signals, arising from cardiac, respiratory, and blood-pressure modulations, interfere with measurement of the hemodynamic response to brain stimulation. Whole-head optical measurements, in addition to providing maps of multiple brain regions' responses to brain activation, will enable better understandings of the physiological signals, ultimately leading to better signal processing algorithms to distinguish physiological signal clutter from brain activation signals.",Excluded
1892,"Restricting exposure to pulsed and broadband magnetic fields A general procedure is described for application of the new ICNIRP exposure guidelines to pulsed and broadband magnetic fields below 100 kHz. The procedure involves weighting of the spectral components with a function that takes into account the basic restrictions and reference levels. A simple first-order RC response or its piecewise linear equivalent is proposed for the weighting function. The weighting can be performed either on the Fourier transformed sample of the measured signal or in real time by processing the signal with an analog or digital filter circuit. The cut-off frequency of the filter is 820 Hz. The occupational exposure criteria are exceeded when the weighted peak magnetic flux density exceeds 43 microT or equivalently the weighted peak dB/dt exceeds 0.22 T s(-1). The maximal peak exposures allowed by the proposed approach are compared with the stimulation thresholds computed with a stimulation model. The results strongly suggest that the safety margin to the stimulation is greater for non-sinusoidal than for sinusoidal waveforms, and at low frequencies it is higher than at high frequencies. The increase of the low-frequency safety margin is desirable to avoid magnetophosphenes and possible CNS effects that may occur below the level predicted by the classical nerve models. Measurement techniques and examples of measured magnetic fields are presented. Particularly high exposures were measured inside MRI equipment and anti-theft gates.",Excluded

In this study, we utilized registry data to determine prognostic features and impact of chemotherapy and radiation on overall survival.METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried from 2006 to 2015 for adult cases with histologically confirmed high-grade brainstem glioma. Covariates including patient demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics and treatment parameters were captured. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify predictors of survival.RESULTS: A total of 422 patients were analyzed. Most patients (66.6%) underwent postoperative radiation with chemotherapy, 9.2% underwent radiation alone, while the remaining had no postoperative treatment (24.2%). Overall median survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.8-12). Survival was longer (p < 0.001) in the radiation + chemotherapy group (median: 14.2 months, 95% CI 11.7-17.1) compared to radiation alone (median: 5.7 months, 95% CI 3.7-12) and no postoperative treatment (median: 1.8 months, 95% CI 1.4-4) groups. In multivariable analysis, increasing age was associated with worse survival (HR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.47-2.37, p < 0.001), whereas radiation + chemotherapy was associated with lower mortality compared to radiation alone (HR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98, p = 0.038). In subgroup analysis, postoperative chemotherapy with radiation was associated with significant survival benefit compared to radiation alone for grade IV (HR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76, p = 0.003), but not for grade III tumors (HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.48-1.58, p = 0.65).CONCLUSION: Analysis from a national registry illustrated the effectiveness of radiation with chemotherapy for adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas, particularly grade IV.

In the brain, ionizing radiation induces breakdown of the blood-brain barrier by effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. Damage from directly irradiated cells can be transferred to surrounding non-exposed bystander cells, known as the radiation-induced bystander effect. We investigated involvement of connexin channels and paracrine signaling in radiation-induced bystander DNA damage in brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to focused X-rays. Irradiation caused DNA damage in the directly exposed area, which propagated over several millimeters in the bystander area. DNA damage was significantly reduced by the connexin channel-targeting peptide Gap26 and the Cx43 hemichannel blocker TAT-Gap19. ATP release, dye uptake, and patch clamp experiments showed that hemichannels opened within 5 min post irradiation in both irradiated and bystander areas.

1525,"[Radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy of vestibular schwannoma] Management of vestibular schwannoma (VS) should always be interdisciplinary and results better than the natural course. Particularly in small VS, either microsurgical resection or radiosurgery (RS) can be employed. RS is a special method (initially only possible stereotactically) for delivering high-precision radiation from many directions to the target point (the isocenter) in a single high dose. With the development of three different systems-Gamma Knife (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden), special linear accelerators, and CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)-the options were extended to 1-5 fractions for RS and multisession RS (msRS), and to up to 6 weeks of conventional fractionation as stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Whereas RS uses high ablative single doses, SRT is based on the well-known radiobiological effects of multiple fractions comprising lower single doses up to a required much higher total dose. Evaluation showed that RS and SRT achieve similarly high rates of tumor control of around 90% and low rates of side effects (1-7%). Therefore, SRT is unnecessary for small but clearly progressing VS, which has made RS a very comfortable, effective treatment option. In addition to SRT, larger VS can be treated comparably effectively with CyberKnife-based msRS. Since modern MRI frequently discovers small VS as ""incidental findings"", the initial biding strategy (wait and scan) is of particular importance. Only with increasing symptoms and detectable tumor growth is the treatment indication established, at which time the decision for surgery and RS/SRT should be taken interdisciplinary under consideration of the patient's wishes.",Excluded

Hence analyzing the mechanisms of such damage and its modulation may result in better prevention or cure. Using mitochondria derived from rat brain/liver as well as sarcoma 180 ascites cells, we have examined the mechanisms of damage to lipid, as assessed by different products of lipid peroxidation and to proteins, as determined by loss of enzyme activity and protein oxidation. Mechanisms involved, in terms of scavenging of ROS have been determined using pulse radiolysis for hydroxyl radical and histidine destruction assay for singlet oxygen. Various ROS were generated using gamma-radiation, photosensitization etc. under different conditions. Some novel porphyrins, with potential uses in photodynamic therapy also were used as photosensitizers. Our study shows that ROS can induce significant oxidative damage in mitochondria from both normal and tumor tissues and this can be inhibited by natural antioxidants like tocotrienols, nicotinamide and caffeine. Damage, on the other hand, can be enhanced by deuteration of the buffer and oxygenation. Our results hence demonstrated that mitochondria were sensitive to damage by ROS and its modulation may have potential uses in prevention of the disease in normal tissues; if damage can be selectively induced in tumor, it can lead to its regression.",Excluded
1924,"Non-thermal resistive switching in Mott insulator nanowires Resistive switching can be achieved in a Mott insulator by applying current/voltage, which triggers an insulator-metal transition (IMT). This phenomenon is key for understanding IMT physics and developing novel memory elements and brain-inspired technology. Despite this, the roles of electric field and Joule heating in the switching process remain controversial. Using nanowires of two archetypal Mott insulators-VO<inf>2</inf> and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> we unequivocally show that a purely non-thermal electrical IMT can occur in both materials. The mechanism behind this effect is identified as field-assisted carrier generation leading to a doping driven IMT. This effect can be controlled by similar means in both VO<inf>2</inf> and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, suggesting that the proposed mechanism is generally applicable to Mott insulators. The energy consumption associated with the non-thermal IMT is extremely low, rivaling that of state-of-the-art electronics and biological neurons. These findings pave the way towards highly energy-efficient applications of Mott insulators. Copyright Â© 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

1512,"Dose-dependent effects of radiation therapy on cerebral blood flow, metabolism, and neurocognitive dysfunction PURPOSE: A prospective study was performed to formally relate dose-dependent radiologically defined changes in normal brain induced by radiotherapy (RT) to neurocognitive dysfunction in subjects with primary brain tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult patients receiving three-dimensional RT for central nervous system (CNS) tumors were enrolled. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and neuropsychological testing were performed before RT and 3 weeks and 6 months after treatment. Analyses were performed for correlations between changes in 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG)-PET (metabolism), (15)O-PET (relative blood flow), regional radiation dose, follow-up time, and neuropsychological test scores.RESULTS: Eleven subjects were enrolled and 6 completed follow-up studies. The PET data showed reduced FDG uptake, with average decreases of 2-6% in regions of the brain receiving greater than 40 Gy at 3 weeks' and 6 months' follow-up. The (15)O-H(2)O PET showed increases (<10%) at 3 weeks in relative regional blood flow in brain receiving greater than 30 Gy, but less at the 6-month follow-up studies. There were significant correlations between decreases in FDG uptake and increased scores from the Symptom Checklist-90-R, with an average increase in T score of 2 (p < 0.0001). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test showed a significant correlation of decreased FDG uptake with increased errors and perseveration in test performance, with an average decrease in T score of 11 (p = 0.037).CONCLUSIONS: A dose-dependent response of CNS tissue was detected using FDG PET in this small number of patients. Decreases in CNS metabolism correlated with decreased performance on neuropsychological tests for problem solving, cognitive flexibility, and global measures of psychopathology. Additional research is needed to verify and define these findings.",Excluded
1652,"Relative contributions of radiation and cisplatin-based chemotherapy to sensorineural hearing loss in head-and-neck cancer patients PURPOSE: To investigate the risk of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in patients with head-and-neck cancer and treated with radiation therapy (RT) or concomitant cisplatin-based chemoradiation, the relationship among SNHL and radiation dose to the cochlea, the use of two common cisplatin dose regimens.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 62 head-and-neck cancer patients treated with curative intent were included in this prospective study. Of the patients, 21 received RT alone, 27 received 40 mg/m(2) weekly cisplatin, 13 received 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks during RT, and 1 received RT with weekly epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor antibody. The effect of chemotherapy and RT dose on hearing was determined using a model that accounted for the age and variability between each ear for each patient.RESULTS: We constructed a model to predict dose-dependent hearing loss for RT or cisplatin-based chemotherapy either alone or in combination. For patients only receiving RT, no significant hearing loss was found at doses to the cochlea of less than 40 Gy. Patients receiving 100 mg/m(2) or 40 mg/m(2) of cisplatin chemotherapy had an estimated +21.5 dB and +9.5 dB hearing loss at 8,000 Hz with low radiation doses (10 Gy), which rose to +38.4 dB and +18.9 dB for high radiation doses (40 Gy).CONCLUSIONS: Use of RT alone with doses of less than 40 Gy did not result in clinically significant hearing loss. High-frequency SNHL was profoundly damaged in patients who received concomitant cisplatin when doses of 100 mg/m(2) were used. The threshold cochlear dose for hearing loss with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and RT was predicted to be 10 Gy. The inner ear radiation dose constraints and cisplatin dose intensity should be considered in the treatment of advanced head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded
1799,"Intraoperative ISO-C C-arm navigation surgery for spinal and pelvic trauma Introduction: In patients with spinal or pelvic injuries caused by high-energy trauma, reconstructive surgery is performed so as to prevent complications and achieve early rehabilitation. Siremobil Iso- C3D (Siemens, Germany) is a mobile C-arm (Iso-C) that can reconstruct 3D images and allow surgeons to perform navigation surgery more accurately and quickly through the intraoperative evaluation of the 3D anatomy. Intraoperative use of fluoroscopy can therefore be reduced, minimizing radiation exposure to patients and medical staff. This report discusses the usefulness and safety of navigation surgery using Iso-C performed on patients with spinal or pelvic trauma. Subjects and methods: Two hundred and ninty patients with spinal or pelvic injuries who received instrumentation surgery using both Iso-C and a navigation system were recruited as subjects (131 with cervical spinal injuries, 126 with thoracolumbar spinal injuries, and 33 with pelvic trauma). All subjects received implants intraoperatively based on 3D images obtained using Iso-C. Screws used included the following: 1,435 pedicle (553 for the cervical spine and 882 for the thoracolumbar spine), 86 cervical lateral mass, 6 odontoid, 112 iliac, and 10 iliosacral. Accuracy of screw insertion was postoperatively evaluated with thin-slice CT (1.25 mm thickness). Grade 1 was assigned to screws that were correctly inserted within the bone cortex. Grade 2 was assigned to those where the screw thread penetrated through the bone cortex but where the deviation was less than 2 mm, while grade 3 was assigned to those for which the deviation was greater than 2 mm. Intraoperative radiation exposure time was also recorded. Result(s): No complications such as neurovascular damage were associated with surgery. Postoperative CT evaluation of the accuracy of screw insertion revealed that grades 2 and 3, were only observed with pedicle screws. For the cervical spine, 10 and 4 screws were defined as grades 2 and 3, respectively, while for the thoracolumbar spine, 22 and 7 were respectively categorized as grades 2 and 3. The rate of faulty insertions was 2.9% for pedicle screws. The average radiation exposure time needed to obtain intraoperative 3D images was 2.2 min. Discussion and conclusion: Reconstructive surgery for spinal or pelvic trauma is likely to be performed urgently and requires secure initial fixation. Computer navigation systems improve the accuracy of surgical procedures by functioning as surgeons' ''second eyes,'' and can be applied during urgent surgery. Moreover, these systems can reduce radiation exposure and thus increase the safety of patients and medical staff.",Excluded
1925,"Severed corticospinal axons recover electrophysiologic control of muscle activity after x-ray therapy in lesioned adult spinal cord Mechanical injury to the adult mammalian spinal cord results in permanent loss of structural integrity at the lesion site and of the brain-controlled function distal to the lesion. Some of these consequences were permanently averted by altering the cellular constituents at the lesion site with x-irradiation delivered within a critical time window after injury. We have reported in a separate article that x-irradiation of sectioned adult rat spinal cord resulted in restitution of structural continuity and regrowth of severed corticospinal axons across and deep into the distal stump. Here, we report that after x-ray therapy of the lesion site severed corticospinal axons of transected adult rat spinal cord recover electrophysiologic control of activity of hindlimb muscles innervated by motoneurons distal to the lesion. The degree of recovery of control of muscle activity was directly related to the degree of restitution of structural integrity. This restitution of electrophysiologic function implies that the regenerating corticospinal axons reestablish connectivity with neurons within the target field in the distal stump. Our data suggest that recovery of structural continuity is a sufficient condition for the axotomized corticospinal neurons to regain some of their disrupted function in cord regions distal to the lesion site.",Included
2091,"Involvement of protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPMEG in motor learning and cerebellar long-term depression Although protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is important for hippocampus-dependent learning, its role in cerebellum-dependent learning remains unclear. We previously found that PTPMEG, a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs), bound to the carboxyl-terminus of the glutamate receptor delta2 via the postsynaptic density-95/discs-large/ZO-1 domain of PTPMEG. In the present study, we generated PTPMEG-knockout (KO) mice, and addressed whether PTPMEG is involved in cerebellar plasticity and cerebellum-dependent learning. The structure of the cerebellum in PTPMEG-KO mice appeared grossly normal. However, we found that PTPMEG-KO mice showed severe impairment in the accelerated rotarod test. These mice also exhibited impairment in rapid acquisition of the cerebellum-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning, in which conditioned stimulus (450-ms tone) and unconditioned stimulus (100-ms periorbital electrical shock) were co-terminated. Moreover, long-term depression at parallel fiber-PC synapses was significantly attenuated in these mice. Developmental elimination of surplus climbing fibers and the physiological properties of excitatory synaptic inputs to PCs appeared normal in PTPMEG-KO mice. These results suggest that tyrosine dephosphorylation events regulated by PTPMEG are important for both motor learning and cerebellar synaptic plasticity.",Excluded

Also, lipid peroxidation as malondialdehyde (MDA) and metallothionein (MT) levels were measured in liver, kidney and testis. Rats were exposed to total dose of 0.03Gy gamma-rays along 12h at a low dose rate (2.5mGy/h). The results obtained manifested elevation in all essential metals studied in liver. All organs showed elevated Ca levels except that of brain with non-significant change in intestine. Decrease in Fe levels were observed in kidney, testis, intestine, heart and brain tissues with insignificant change in spleen tissue. Elevation in MDA in liver and kidney tissues was recorded and an inhibition in MT in liver, kidney and testis tissues was demonstrated. In conclusion, the previous essential metals tested are very sensitive to low dose (0.03Gy) gamma-rays. Such dose can induce alterations in the oxidative stress parameters under investigation.

To evaluate each model, rats (n = 12) with C6 gliomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced MRI at 7 time points over 2 weeks. Rats received either 20 or 40 Gy between the third and fourth imaging time point. Diffusion-weighted MRI was used to estimate tumor cell number within enhancing regions in contrast-enhanced MRI data. Each model was fit to the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor cell number from time point 1 to time point 5 to estimate model parameters. The estimated model parameters were then used to predict tumor growth at the final 2 imaging time points. The model prediction was evaluated by calculating the error in tumor volume estimates, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number.RESULTS: For both the rats treated with either 20 or 40 Gy, significantly lower error in tumor volume, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number was observed for the M<sub>dp</sub> and M<sub>p</sub> models compared with the M<sub>d</sub> model. The M<sub>dp</sub> model fit, however, had significantly lower sum squared error compared with the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>d</sub> models.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that for both doses, the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>dp</sub> models result in accurate predictions of tumor growth, whereas the M<sub>d</sub> model poorly describes response to radiation therapy.",Excluded
1417,"An exploration of the factor structure and development of potentially useful subscales of etiological beliefs about schizophrenia in a general population sample Background: Given that accessing care, treatment engagement, and course and outcomes among people with schizophrenia may be influenced by beliefs about causes in the larger community, causal beliefs about schizophrenia have been studied in numerous communities around the world. In particular, the 30-item list of etiological attributions developed by Angermeyer and colleagues has been used to describe causal beliefs in patients, family members, and lay community members within such communities. The current study, the first examination of the latent or factorial structure of these 30 causal beliefs, seeks to provide informative subscales that may enhance reliability and validity of groupings of causes for future analyses involving community members. Method(s): Data were gathered from six separate surveys involving three distinct groups of individuals from the same community within the southeastern United States: lay community members, relatives of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and police officers at the start of a 1-week mental health training program. Result(s): Exploratory factor analysis in the overall sample (n = 577) revealed four factors that were used to define four subscales, termed: personal/family/social stressors (14 items), inconsistent with modern conceptions of risk (8 items), external/environmental insults to the brain (6 items), and consistent with modern biological conceptions (2 items). Cronbach's internal consistency reliability coefficients for these subscales were 0.91, 0.83, 0.71, and 0.65, respectively. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that subscales could be derived to provide continuous measures for assessing causal beliefs in order to study how this concept relates to attitudes toward schizophrenia, the people affected by the disorder, and treatments that are recommended by mental health professionals. Replication within similar and dissimilar groups is warranted. Â© Springer-Verlag 2009.",Excluded

1315,"Limitations of analytical dose calculations for small field proton radiosurgery The purpose of the work was to evaluate the dosimetric uncertainties of an analytical dose calculation engine and the impact on treatment plans using small fields in intracranial proton stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS) for a gantry based double scattering system. 50 patients were evaluated including 10 patients for each of 5 diagnostic indications of: arteriovenous malformation (AVM), acoustic neuroma (AN), meningioma (MGM), metastasis (METS), and pituitary adenoma (PIT). Treatment plans followed standard prescription and optimization procedures for PSRS. We performed comparisons between delivered dose distributions, determined by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and those calculated with the analytical dose calculation algorithm (ADC) used in our current treatment planning system in terms of dose volume histogram parameters and beam range distributions. Results show that the difference in the dose to 95% of the target (D95) is within 6% when applying measured field size output corrections for AN, MGM, and PIT. However, for AVM and METS, the differences can be as great as 10% and 12%, respectively. Normalizing the MC dose to the ADC dose based on the dose of voxels in a central area of the target reduces the difference of the D95 to within 6% for all sites. The generally applied margin to cover uncertainties in range (3.5% of the prescribed range + 1 mm) is not sufficient to cover the range uncertainty for ADC in all cases, especially for patients with high tissue heterogeneity. The root mean square of the R90 difference, the difference in the position of distal falloff to 90% of the prescribed dose, is affected by several factors, especially the patient geometry heterogeneity, modulation and field diameter. In conclusion, implementation of Monte Carlo dose calculation techniques into the clinic can reduce the uncertainty of the target dose for proton stereotactic radiosurgery. If MC is not available for treatment planning, using MC dose distributions to adjust the delivered doses level can also reduce uncertainties below 3% for mean target dose and 6% for the D95.",Excluded

1324,"Aberrant regulation of interleukin-2 but not of interferon-gamma gene expression in Down syndrome (trisomy 21) The regulated expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) genes was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 29 noninstitutionalized Down syndrome individuals and compared to that of 32 normal donors. Culture conditions were chosen that measure the transient, phytohemagglutinin-induced expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA, as well as the intactness of post-transcriptional and suppressor T cell-dependent mechanisms that control this expression. The latter was achieved by analyzing, respectively, the superinduction of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA occurring upon culture with cycloheximide or after low-dose gamma-irradiation. A convenient, sensitive, and quantitative assay for specific mRNA was devised, suitable for measuring mRNA levels expressed in cells from 1 ml of peripheral blood. Analysis of individuals with Down syndrome revealed a pronounced decrease in inducibility of the IL-2 gene. By contrast, induction of IFN-gamma mRNA was as vigorous as that observed for normal donors. In cells from trisomic subjects, superinduction of IFN-gamma mRNA by cycloheximide was at least as extensive as for normal donors, while in the case of IL-2 mRNA, it was weaker. These abnormal patterns of IL-2 gene expression were seen irrespective of age. Our findings demonstrate a selective impairment of IL-2 gene expression in Down syndrome, rather than a general deficiency in helper T cells.",Excluded
1831,"Non tumor perfusion changes following stereotactic radiosurgery to brain metastases Purpose: To evaluate early perfusion changes in normal tissue following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Method(s): Nineteen patients harboring twenty-two brain metastases treated with SRS were imaged with dynamic susceptibility magnetic resonance imaging (DSC MRI) at baseline, 1 week and 1 month post SRS. Relative cerebral blood volume and flow (rCBV and rCBF) ratios were evaluated outside of tumor within a combined region of interest (ROI) and separately within gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) ROIs. Threedimensional dose distribution from each SRS plan was divided into six regions: (1) <2 Gy; (2) 2-5 Gy; (3) 5-10 Gy; (4) 10-12 Gy; (5) 12-16 Gy; and (6) >16 Gy. rCBV and rCBF ratio differences between baseline, 1 week and 1 month were compared. Best linear fit plots quantified normal tissue dose-dependency. Result(s): Significant rCBV ratio increases were present between baseline and 1 month for all ROIs and dose ranges except for WM ROI receiving <2 Gy. rCBV ratio for all ROIs was maximally increased from baseline to 1 month with the greatest changes occurring within the 5-10 Gy dose range (53.1%). rCBF ratio was maximally increased from baseline to 1 month for all ROIs within the 5-10 Gy dose range (33.9-45.0%). Both rCBV and rCBF ratios were most elevated within GM ROIs. A weak, positive but not significant association between dose, rCBV and rCBF ratio was demonstrated. Progressive rCBV and rCBF ratio increased with dose up to 10 Gy at 1 month. Conclusion(s): Normal tissue response following SRS can be characterized by dose, tissue, and time specific increases in rCBV and rCBF ratio. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2014.",Excluded

Wild type bovine and recombinant protein differ by posttranslational modification of lysine 561 but interact similarly with a short peptide (fluorescein-labeled FYQLALT) and with denatured staphylococcal nuclease-(Delta135-149). Mutation E543K results in 4. 5-fold faster release of peptide and lower stability of complexes with staphylococcal nuclease-(Delta135-149). ATP hydrolysis rates of the wild type proteins are enhanced 6-10-fold by the addition of peptide. The E543K mutant has a peptide-stimulated hydrolytic rate similar to that of wild type protein but a higher unstimulated rate, yielding a mere 2-fold enhancement. All three versions of Hsc70 possess similar ATP-dependent conformational shifts, and all show potassium ion dependence. These data support the following model: (i) in the presence of K+, Mg2+, and ATP, the peptide binding domain inhibits the ATPase; (ii) binding of peptide relieves this inhibition; and (iii) the E543K mutation significantly attenuates the inhibition by the peptide binding domain and destabilizes Hsc70-peptide complexes.",Excluded

This new paradigm, involving inputs from different sensory systems, allows quantification of several critical parameters, like orientation performance, walking velocities and postural stability, in a natural walking task. The paper presented here mainly focuses on spatial orientation performance quantified by the errors in walking the previously seen path without vision. Errors in length and reaching the corners did not change significantly from pre- to post-flight, while absolute angular errors slightly increased post-flight. The significant decrease in walking velocity and a change in head-trunk coordination while walking around the corners of the path observed post-flight may suggest that during re-adaptation to gravity the mechanisms which are necessary to perform the task have to be re-accomplished.",Excluded

Here, we report the successful treatment of R/R DLBCL with programmed cell death 1 (PD1) inhibition post-allogeneic CAR-T. Case Report: A previously healthy 26-year-old Caucasian man developed B-symptoms and cervical lymphadenopathy. Biopsy revealed DLBCL, activated B-cell subtype, double expressor and Ki-67 >80%. PET/CT scan revealed disease above and below the diaphragm. He achieved a partial response (PR) after R-CHOP, progressive disease (PD) after R-ICE, stable disease (SD) after R-ESHAP, and PD one month after autologous CD19-targeted CAR-T with CTL019 (CD3zeta/4-1BB). He then received R-lenalidomide (len) with radiation (24 Gy) to his mediastinal mass achieving a PR, followed by a myeloablative (Cy/TBI-12 Gy) allogeneic stem cell transplant (aSCT) from his 10/10 HLAmatched brother. He achieved 100% donor chimerism 30 days post-aSCT (D+30). Despite persistent full donor chimerism, D+60 PET/CT showed PD with confirmed relapse upon biopsy. Immunosuppression was discontinued, and ibrutinib with len was started, followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) which led to a mixed response. He then continued on ibrutinib with weekly temsirolimus and received a second DLI achieving a PR, with PD shortly thereafter. He next proceeded to allogeneic CAR-T with axicabtagene-ciloleucel (CD3zeta/CD28), complicated by grade 1 cytokine release syndrome without neurotoxicity. Three weeks post-CAR-T, he developed diplopia due to a cranial nerve palsy. Brain MRI showed new pontine T2 changes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for lymphoma and infection, but notable for T-cell predominance. One month postCAR-T, PET/CT showed a complete metabolic response (CMR). Repeat brain MRI was unchanged. Two months later, he developed dizziness and intractable nausea, and repeat brain MRI showed a new lesion in the inferior cerebellar vermis, with resolution of previous pontine change. Evaluation of the CSF and peripheral blood revealed no CAR T-cell persistence, and PET/CT confirmed disease relapse in the cerebellum and mediastinum. Patient then received focal radiation (24 Gy) to his cerebellar lesion along with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, after which his neurologic symptoms resolved. MRI one day after radiation showed near-complete resolution of enhancing vermis lesion. After 3 cycles of pembrolizumab, PET/CT showed a CMR, with no active disease on brain MRI. Three months into PD1-inhibition therapy, his disease remains in CMR, without GVHD nor treatment-related toxicities. Conclusion(s): This case illustrates the efficacy of allogeneic CAR-T after failure of autologous CAR-T and aSCT. Furthermore, PD1 inhibition can be used safely after allogeneic CAR-T, underscoring the need for prospective clinical studies. Copyright Â© 2018",Excluded
1414,"Short-arm human centrifugation with 0.4g at eye and 0.75g at heart level provides similar cerebrovascular and cardiovascular responses to standing BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Orthostatic intolerance continues to be a problem with astronauts upon return to Earth as a result of cerebral and cardiovascular adaptations to weightlessness. We tested the hypothesis that artificial gravity from a short-arm human centrifuge (SAHC) could provide cerebral and cardiovascular stimuli similar to upright posture and thereby serve as a suitable countermeasure.METHODS: We compared cardiovascular and cerebrovascular responses before, during, and after exposure to hyper-G with that of standing in healthy young participants. The head was positioned such that the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was 0.46 m from the center of rotation. Two levels of hyper-G that provided 1g and 2g at foot level were investigated. Continuous blood pressure, heart rate, calf blood volume, MCA mean blood flow velocity (MFV) and end-tidal CO2 were measured.RESULTS: Blood pressure at the level of the MCA (BP-MCA) and MFV was reduced during stand and at 2g. The relationship between MFV and BP-MCA at 2g was different from supine and similar to standing, while 1g centrifugation was not different from supine. The cardiovascular system was also not different from supine at 1g but was similarly challenged in 2g compared to stand.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that short-arm centrifugation 2g at the feet, with the head offset 0.5 m from the center, provides similar cardiovascular and cerebral responses to standing. This supports the hypothesis that passive 2g SAHC exposure at the feet could be used as a countermeasure for in-flight cardiovascular and cerebrovascular deconditioning.",Excluded

Localization of target isocenter coordinates in MR images was also checked with the phantom. Result(s): An overall spatial error of about 1 mm for subsequent stereotactic irradiation was obtained. Conclusion(s): The accuracy of the fixation and localization techniques is adequate to investigate radiation-induced changes in the rat brain.,Excluded

1511,"Prospective evaluation of relationships between radiotherapy dose to masticatory apparatus and trismus AIMS: This feasibility study aimed to identify relationships between radiation doses to the masticatory apparatus as a combined block or as individual subunits with changes in trismus following radiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients from a single center were recruited prospectively as part of a randomized trial comparing proactive exercises in the management of trismus. Patients with stage III/IV oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers received intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concurrent systemic therapy. All patients had trismus prior to radiotherapy. Maximal inter-incisor distance (MID) was measured pre- and 6 months from the start of radiotherapy. Bilateral muscles of mastication: medial and lateral pterygoids (MP and LP), masseters (M), temporalis (T), temporomandibular joint (TMJ) were contoured on CT images. The block comprised all muscles excluding the TMJ below the orbital floor. Mean dose, equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and V35-V60 Gy were compared with change in MID.RESULTS: In six patients, the MID deteriorated at 6 months from the start of radiotherapy compared with 14 whose MID improved. No significant association was observed between age, gender, smoking, alcohol status, exercise compliance, cisplatin, tumor site, stage, V35-V60 Gy or EUD with change in MID. A clinical outlier was excluded. Without the outlier (n = 19), a significant association was seen between mean dose and change in MID at 6 months for the ipsilateral block (p = .01), LP (p = .04) and M (p < .01). All patients where trismus deteriorated at 6 months received mean doses >40 Gy to the block.CONCLUSION: Higher mean radiation doses to the ipsilateral block, LP and M were significantly associated with deterioration in trismus. Limiting dose to these structures to <=40 Gy for tumors not invading the masticatory muscles may improve treatment-related sequelae. The ipsilateral block, LP and M should be studied further as possible alternative avoidance structures in radiotherapy treatment planning.",Excluded

1398,"Spontaneous network activity in the embryonic spinal cord regulates AMPAergic and GABAergic synaptic strength Spontaneous network activity (SNA) has been described in most developing circuits, including the spinal cord, retina, and hippocampus. Despite the widespread nature of this developmental phenomenon, its role in network maturation is poorly understood. We reduced SNA in the intact embryo and found compensatory increases in synaptic strength of spinal motoneuron inputs. AMPAergic miniature postsynaptic current (mPSC) amplitude and frequency increased following the reduction of activity. Interestingly, excitatory GABAergic mPSCs also increase in amplitude through a process of synaptic scaling. Finally, the normal modulation of GABAergic mPSC amplitude was accelerated. Together, these compensatory responses appear to increase the excitability of the cord and could act to maintain appropriate SNA levels, thus demonstrating a distinct functional role for synaptic homeostasis. Because spontaneous network activity can regulate AMPAergic and GABAergic synaptic strength during development, SNA is likely to play an important role in a coordinated maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength.",Excluded

2271,"Quantitative analysis of conebeam CT for delineating stents in stent-assisted coil embolization BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Innovative techniques and device-related advances have improved the outcomes of neuroendovascular treatment. 3D imaging has previously used 2 < 2 binning, but 1 < 1 binning has recently been made available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative ability of conebeam CT for stent delineation and to investigate its effectiveness in the clinical environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four acquisition groups of 3D MIP images acquired using conebeam CT with varying conditions (acquisition time, 10 or 20 seconds and binning, 1 < 1 or 2 < 2) were compared. Two methods of analysis were performed, a phantom study and an analysis of 28 randomly selected patients. The phantom study assessed the contrast-to-noise ratio and full width at half maximum values in conebeam CT images of intracranial stent struts. In the clinical subjects, we assessed contrast-to-noise ratio, full width at half maximum, and dose-area product. RESULT(S): In the phantom study, the contrast-to-noise ratio was not considerably different between 10- and 20-second acquisition times at equivalent binning settings. Additionally, the contrast-to-noise ratio at equivalent acquisition times did not differ considerably by binning setting. For the full width at half maximum results, equivalent acquisition times differed significantly by binning setting. In the clinical analyses, the 10-second/1 < 1 group (versus 20 second/2 < 2) showed a higher contrast-to-noise ratio (P .05) and a dose-area product reduced by approximately 70% (P .05), but the difference in full width at half maximum was not significant (P<.20). CONCLUSION(S): For stent-assisted coil embolization, quantitative assessment of conebeam CT showed that 10 second/1 < 1 was equivalent to 20 second/2 < 2 for imaging deployed intracranial stents. Furthermore, the 10-second/1 < 1 settings resulted in a much smaller DAP. Copyright Â© 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology. All rights reserved.",Excluded

We used fluorinated polyimide because of its biocompatibility and excellent thermal and mechanical properties for ion irradiation. Rattus norvegicus chromaffin (PC12) cells were used for in vitro studies. The polyimide films were irradiated with He(+), Ne(+), or Kr(+) ions in a fluence range from 10(13) to 10(15) ions/cm(2) at 50 keV. PC12 cells selectively adhered to the polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation. The total neurite length for PC12 cells grown on the Kr(+)-irradiated film was the longest; the neurite length on the film irradiated by Kr(+) after 9 days was approximately five times longer than that for cells grown on the He(+)-irradiated film, i.e., 135 micro m. In addition, the PC12 differentiation rate on the ion-irradiated polyimide films also showed a similar trend to the total neurite length for PC12 cells cultured on the films: the rate decreased in the order Kr(+) > Ne(+) > He(+). This initial study indicated enhanced neurite outgrowth and differentiation of PC12 cells on fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation.",Excluded

A large multicenter analysis was carried out to generate reliable safety data and elucidate the mechanism.METHODS: A total of 161 melanoma patients from 11 European skin cancer centers were evaluated for acute and late toxicity, of whom 70 consecutive patients received 86 series of radiotherapy with concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy. To further characterize and quantify a possible radiosensitization by BRAF inhibitors, blood samples of 35 melanoma patients were used for individual radiosensitivity testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization of chromosomal breaks after ex vivo irradiation.RESULTS: With radiotherapy and concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy the rate of acute radiodermatitis >=2degree was 36% and follicular cystic proliferation was seen in 13% of all radiotherapies. Non-skin toxicities included hearing disorders (4%) and dysphagia (2%). Following whole-brain radiotherapy, rates of radiodermatitis >=2degree were 44% and 8% (P < 0.001) for patients with and without BRAF inhibitor therapy, respectively. Concomitant treatment with vemurafenib induced acute radiodermatitis >=2degree more frequently than treatment with dabrafenib (40% versus 26%, P = 0.07). In line with these findings, analysis of chromosomal breaks ex vivo indicated significantly increased radiosensitivity for patients under vemurafenib (P = 0.004) and for patients switched from vemurafenib to dabrafenib (P = 0.002), but not for patients on dabrafenib only. No toxicities were reported after stereotactic treatment.CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy with concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy is feasible with an acceptable increase in toxicity.

2220,"Recent advances in research on radiofrequency fields and health: 2001-2003 The widespread use of wireless telecommunications devices, particularly mobile phones, has resulted in increased human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields. Although national and international agencies have established safety guidelines for exposure to RF fields, concerns remain about the potential for adverse health outcomes to occur in relation to RF field exposure. The extensive literature on RF fields and health has been reviewed by a number of authorities, including the Royal Society of Canada (1999), the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity, and the Environment (CSTEE, 2001), the British Medical Association (2001), the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority (Boice & McLaughlin, 2002), and the Health Council of the Netherlands (2002). This report provides an update on recent research results on the potential health risks of RF fields since the publication of the Royal Society of Canada report in 1999 (See Krewski et al., 2001a) and our previous 2001 update (Krewski et al., 2001b), covering the period 2001-2003. The present report examines new data on dosimetry and exposure assessment, biological effects such as enzyme induction, and toxicological effects, including genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and testicular and reproductive outcomes. Epidemiological studies of mobile phone users and occupationally exposed populations are examined, along with human and animal studies of neurological and behavioral effects. All of the authoritative reviews completed within the last 2 yr have concluded that there is no clear evidence of adverse health effects associated with RF fields. However, following a recent review of nine epidemiological studies of mobile phones and cancer, Kundi et al. (2004) concluded that the possibility of an enhanced cancer risk cannot be excluded. These same reviews support the need for further research to clarify the possible associations between RF fields and adverse health outcomes that have appeared in some reports. The results of the ongoing World Health Organization (WHO) study of mobile phones will provide important new information in this regard. Copyright Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Excluded

To verify this possibility, we investigated the direct interaction between pp60 <sup>v-src</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM using a myristoylated peptide corresponding to the N-terminal region of pp60<sup>v-src</sup>. The binding assay indicated that only the myristoylated peptide binds to Ca <sup>2+</sup>/CaM, and the non-myristoylated peptide is not able to bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. Analyses of the binding kinetics revealed two independent reactions with the dissociation constants (K<inf>D</inf>) of 2.07x10 <sup>-9</sup>M (K<inf>D1</inf>) and 3.93x10<sup>-6</sup>M (K <inf>D2</inf>), respectively. Two serine residues near the myristoyl moiety of the peptide (Ser2, Ser11) were phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro, and the phosphorylation drastically reduced the interaction.

The method can be used with smaller field of view scans, thereby allowing for a lower radiation dose. This retrospective study used two dry skulls and secondary data from 15 patients who had more than one scan taken using the same machine. Two observers tested two types of regional voxel-based superimposition: maxillary and mandibular. The registration took 10-15 s. Three-dimensional surface models of the maxillas and mandibles were generated via standardized threshold segmentation, and the accuracy and reproducibility of the superimpositions were assessed using the iterative closest point technique to measure the root mean square (RMS) distance between the images. Five areas were measured and a RMS <= 0.25 was considered successful. Descriptive statistics and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to compare the intra-observer measurement reproducibility. The ICC was >=0.980 for all of the variables and the highest RMS found was 0.241. The inter-observer reproducibility was assessed case by case and was perfect (RMS 0) for 68% (23 out of 34) of the superimpositions done and not clinically significant (RMS <= 0.25) for the other 32%. The method is fast, accurate, and reproducible and is an alternative to cranial base superimposition. Copyright Â© 2015 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded

Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has led to improved overall survival (OS) for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has responded completely to chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy. However, whether PCI is indicated for elderly patients remains unclear. Method(s): We reviewed 658 patients with limited-stage SCLC treated in 1986-2009 at a single institution with definitive concurrent chemoradiation to a total radiation dose of 45-70 Gy. Variables investigated for possible association with OS included patient sex, age, ethnicity, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, year of diagnosis and treatment period (1986-1999 vs. 2000-2009), tumor size, radiation dose, cycles of induction chemotherapy, use of intensity-modulated-radiation-therapy (IMRT), and fractionation. Groups were compared with chi-square tests for categorical variables or medians tests for continuous variables. Kaplan-Meier estimates were constructed for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local-recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Result(s): Among 658 patients, 507 patients were <70 years old (Group A) and 151 patients were >=70 years old (Group B). Median survival time was significantly longer in the younger group (25.6 months vs. 20.3 months, P=0.007), but no differences were found in DFS, LRFS, or DMFS time by age. Of the 151 patients aged >=70 years (54 of whom received PCI and 89 did not), those treated in 2000-2009 (vs. 1986-1999) had better brain MFS than those treated in 1986-1999 (P=0.048); those who received PCI had better brain MFS than those who did not (P=0.033). Multivariate analysis showed that among patients aged >=70, receiving PCI, not receiving induction chemotherapy, and local-regional control were associated with fewer brain metastases (for PCI, subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]=0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.95, P=0.037; for induction chemotherapy, SHR=0.43, 95% CI=0.19-0.96, P=0.039; and for local-regional failure, SHR=0.996, 95% CI=0.993- 0.998, P=0.001). Among patients >=70, receipt of PCI seemed to have been associated with better OS for those with small-volume disease (primary+nodal disease <5 cm, P=0.0545) but not for those with larger-volume disease (P=0.7387). Conclusion(s): Patients aged >=70 years with small-volume limited-stage SCLC seemed to show a benefit in OS from the use of PCI, but those with larger-volume disease did not.

1936,"Salvage craniospinal irradiation for recurrent germinomas BACKGROUND: The treatment strategies for recurrence has not been established. PURPOSE: To clarify the tumor control and complications of salvage craniospinal irradiation (CSI) for recurrent germinoma. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the medical record. Among 153 germinomas treated in Tohoku University Hospital since 1983, 22 had recurrence of germinoma. At first recurrence, 7 cases received CSI, whereas 15 cases did chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy other than craniospinal field (non- CSI). CSI was performed at 24 Gy/ 12 fractions or 30 Gy/ 25 fractions. RESULT(S): CSI had statistically significant better recurrence-free survival rate after recurrence than non-CSI (100% vs 33%, p<0.001: log-rank test). In addition, tumor control was obtained in all of four cases with the failure after non- CSI treatments for recurrence. The late complications of these 11 cases were examined. The local dose before CSI was 24- 50 Gy, and the median interval from last irradiation to CSI was 33 months. Median follow- up period after CSI was 126 months. Three patients developed newly developed visual or cognitive deficits. These patients received high-dose irradiation at initial treatment or multiple treatment before CSI. There were no late complications in the cases which had prior chemotherapy and 24 Gy of irradiation to whole ventricle only before CSI. CONCLUSION(S): Low dose CSI for the first recurrence of germinoma is effective and safe in the cases treated by chemotherapy and low dose irradiation to whole ventricle only.",Excluded

Discogenic low back pain is believed to result from the degeneration and disruption of outer fibers of the intervertebral disc annulus, leading to a cycle of persistent inflammation, damage to the disc matrix, and sensitization of developed annular nociceptors. We selected 11 patients as subjects on the basis of clinical findings and the results of provocative disc blockade. The patients underwent percutaneous irradiation of affected lumbar discs with a diode laser. The mean total irradiation energy per disc was 740 +/- 2.51 J, with a range of 610 to 960 J. The patients' responses were assessed with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) to determine the average level of pain. The patients' mean ODI scores at 1 day, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after laser irradiation were 18.63 +/- 11.22, 13.6 +/- 4.53, 12.5 +/- 5.5, 11.8 +/- 5.25, 10.5 +/- 2.27, and 10.5 +/- 2.27, respectively, versus a mean pre-treatment ODI score of 50.27 +/- 9.35. Their mean VAS scores at the same post-treatment intervals were 3.09 +/- 2.36, 2.4 +/- 0.97, 2.7 +/- 1.16, 2.1 +/- 0.74, 2.1 +/- 0.81, and 2.1 +/- 0.88, respectively, versus a mean pre-treatment VAS score of 7.64 +/- 1.21. The post- versus pre-treatment scores for both the ODI and VAS indicated a statistically significant clinical benefit across the full 24-month follow-up period after laser irradiation. The efficacy of laser irradiation in treating such pain may come from a thermal effect and reductions of intradiscal pressure, of the concentrations of irritant substances, and of the numbers of nociceptors in the affected region.",Excluded
2223,"Higher seizure susceptibility in rats with cortical dysplasia: A feedback systems perspective Rationale: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is one of the leading causes of drug resistant focal epilepsy. Despite significant advances in various diagnostic and therapeutic methods, the basic mechanisms of higher susceptibility for seizures in patients with CD remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to develop a mathematical framework using principles from second order system dynamics to further characterize the effect of a ""second hit"" [acute single pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure] in animal model of in utero radiation-induced CD as compared to a PTZ induced seizure in normal control rat. Method(s): CD was induced through in utero irradiation of 4 pregnant Sprague Dawley rats at E17 with 145 cGy. Fourteen litters (XRT) were implanted with intracortical depth electrodes targeting the right and left frontal and parietal cortex. A set of 27 aged matched normal rats served as controls. All rats were injected with PTZ at 40 mg/kg. Post PTZ injection, all 14 XRT rats developed seizures (Group 1), 17 out of 27 normal rats developed seizures (Group 2) and in 10 normal rats, PTZ injection failed to induce seizures (Group 3). The flow diagram of experimental steps involved is provided in Fig. 1A. To characterize the response of the abnormal/normal brain to PTZ, the average gamma coherence (Cr) across all pairs of electrode and across all rats within a group was computed for the entire duration of recording (24 hours). The Cr profile can be viewed as the impulse response of an over-damped 2nd order system (See Fig.1C), the impulse function being the PTZ injection. The system parameters can then be estimated by fitting Eq.1 to Cr. Result(s): Fig. 1B shows Cr profile and the fitted data for the 3 groups of rats. Table 1, shows the location of poles s1, s2, the under-damped natural frequency (omegan) and the damping ratio of the system (xi). The slow pole s1 represents the long-term effects of the PTZ injection whereas the fast pole s2 dictates the immediate reaction of the system to external perturbation. Note that the slow pole is similar across the 3 groups (Fig. 1D). The location of the pole represents the stability of the system. The location of fast pole is closest to the imaginary axes for XRT rats and hence is suggestive of a less stable system. The lowest damping ratio is for the XRT rat, followed by rats in Group 2 and Group 3. A high damping ratio indicates that the system is resistive to oscillations caused by external perturbations. Conclusion(s): Our study shows that there exists an internal feedback mechanism within the brain of normal rats which reduces its susceptibility to epileptogenesis. We hypothesize that this feedback control mechanism is dysfunctional within the dysplastic (CD) rat brain. Support for this claim is provided by the relatively lower damping ratio and location of the fast pole of the CD rats (p<0.01). Translation of this concept to human studies using neurostimulation paradigms may provide a novel methodology to characterize and measure epileptogenicity in abnormal/normal tissues. Our future work will be targeted along these lines. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

All recurrences confined to the brain were found within 4 cm of the enhancing tumor as defined by the preoperative computerized tomography scan. Recurrences outside the boost were more common with inadequate boost margins, small boost volumes, temporal lobe tumors, and homolateral wedge pair technique. Survival was not adversely affected by recurrence outside the boost.

Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the effect of MW radiation on memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The rats were exposed to 2.45 GHz MW radiation (continuous wave with overall average power density of 0.016 mW/cm2 and overall average whole-body specific absorption rate value of 0.017 W/kg) for 2 h/day over a period of 40 days. Spatial learning and memory were tested by radial maze and passive avoidance tests. We evaluated the synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neuronal cells number by field potential recording and Giemsa staining, respectively. Our results showed that MW radiation exposure decreased the learning and memory performance that was associated with decrement of long-term potentiation induction and excitability of CA1 neurons. However, MW radiation did not have any effects on short-term plasticity and paired-pulse ratio as a good indirect index for measurement of glutamate release probability. The evaluation of hippocampal morphology indicated that the neuronal density in the hippocampal CA1 area was significantly decreased by MW.",Excluded

1357,"Structural plasticity of the adult central nervous system: Insights from the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. [French] Accumulating evidence renders the dogma obsolete according to which the structural organization of the brain would remain essentially stable in adulthood, changing only in response to a need for compensatory processes during increasing age and degeneration. It has indeed become clear from investigations on various models that the adult nervous system can adapt to physiological demands by altering reversibly its synaptic circuits. This potential for structural and functional modifications results not only from the plastic properties of neurons but also from the inherent capacity of the glial cellular components to undergo remodeling as well. This is currently known for astrocytes, the major glial cells in brain which are well-recognized as dynamic partners in the mechanisms of synaptic transmission, and for the tanycytes and pituicytes which contribute to the regulation of neurosecretory processes in neurohemal regions of the hypothalamus. Studies on the neuroendocrine hypothalamus, whose role is central in homeostatic regulations, have gained good insights into the spectacular neuronal-glial rearrangements that may subserve functional plasticity in the adult brain. Following pioneering works on the morphological reorganizations taking place in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system under certain physiological conditions such as dehydration and lactation, studies on the gonadotropic system that orchestrates reproductive functions have re-emphasized the dynamic interplay between neurons and glia in brain structural plasticity processes. This review summarizes the major contributions provided by these researches in the field and also addresses the question of the morphological rearrangements that occur on a 24-h basis in the central component of the circadian clock responsible for the temporal aspects of endocrine regulations. Taken together, the reviewed data highlight the close cooperation between neurons and glia in developing strategies for functional adaptation of the brain to the changing conditions of the internal and external environment.

The present work reports that somatostatin modulates the Ca(2+) activated K(+) currents (K(Ca) currents) expressed by projection cells. These actions contribute in designing the firing pattern of the spiny projection neuron; which is the output of the neostriatum. Small conductance (SK) and large conductance (BK) K(Ca) currents represent between 30% and 50% of the sustained outward current in spiny cells. Somatostatin reduces SK-type K(+) currents and at the same time enhances BK-type K(+) currents. This dual effect enhances the fast component of the after hyperpolarizing potential while reducing the slow component. Somatostatin then modifies the firing pattern of spiny neurons which changed from a tonic regular pattern to an interrupted ""stuttering""-like pattern. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tissue expression analysis of dorsal striatal somatostatinergic receptors (SSTR) mRNA revealed that all five SSTR mRNAs are present. However, single cell RT-PCR profiling suggests that the most probable receptor in charge of this modulation is the SSTR2 receptor. Interestingly, aspiny interneurons may exhibit a ""stuttering""-like firing pattern. Therefore, somatostatin actions appear to be the entrainment of projection neurons to the rhythms generated by some interneurons. Somatostatin is then capable of modifying the processing and output of the neostriatum.",Excluded
2166,"Radiobiological characteristics for the medical proton beam with an energy of 1000 mev. [German] The effects MeV a narrow proton beam with an energy of 1000 mew were studied with the survival test in a phantom behind 7 g/cm<sup>2</sup> of mass on the haploid prototrophic strain of yeast-cells and by the response of canine cerebral tissue in the area of the central ray and at the edge of the range of action. Following the survival test the relative biological effectiveness (RBW) after the action of primary protons and of secondary particles on yeast-cells was estimated for the depth studied with approximately 1 related to the therapeutic X-radiation. The damaging radiation effect to yeast-cells was found to be limited to a distance of 60 mm which nearly corresponds to the 0.1-0.2% isodose with a dose in the middle of 1,000,000 rad. The effect on the brain consists of circumscript necroses in the area of radiation focussing and a narrow about 1 mm wide area of perifocal changes. The neighbouring cerebral structures, on the other hand, possess a high integrity.

2034,"[Effect of scattering and spatial resolution on SPECT quantification values: experimental study using phantoms and clinical application] The relative SPECT values are often inaccurate by the scattering and limited spatial resolution of single photon emission CT (SPECT). These effects were studied using phantoms and some attentions on clinical application were investigated. Using cylindrical phantom divided into six compartments filled with various radioactivities, the linear correlation between SPECT value and radioactivity, and also correlation with partial reduction of radioactivity were identified. But the SPECT value was relatively increased in proportion to the reduction of radioactivity due to the increase of scattering contribution. The SPECT value represented lower radioactivity when the cortical thickness was smaller than two times of FWHM and represented half radioactivity when the cortical thickness was equal to FWHM. Excellent correlation between SPECT value and radioactive partial volume averaging of brain with CSF was recognized using our hand made phantom simulating various degree of atrophic brain. It is very important to compare SPECT image with X-CT or MR image to avoid misreading taking the above mentioned effects due to scattering and limited spatial resolution.",Excluded

1411,"Examining safety and efficacy of radiosurgery concurrent with checkpoint inhibition for melanoma brain metastases: A prospective registry study Purpose/Objective(s): Immune check-point inhibition with CTLA-4 or PD-1 blockade has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma. This study investigated safety and efficacy associated with check-point inhibitors (CPIs) concurrent with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) in melanoma patients with brain metastases. Materials/Methods: Prospectively collected data were analyzed from an IRB-approved registry of 428 patients with 2830 brain metastases treated with SRS from 2012-2015. Melanoma patients treated with SRS within 1 month of administration of a CPI were identified as being treated concurrently. Patients treated concurrently were matched 1:1 with a control group of melanoma patients treated with SRS alone. All patients had preand post-SRS T1-and T2-weighted MRIs. Categorical variables were compared with Fisher's exact tests, continuous variables with independent sample t-tests, and the log-rank test was used for survival and disease control analyses. Statistical tests were two-tailed, with the significance level set at a<0.05. Result(s): Twenty one melanoma patients with 104 brain metastases were treated concurrently with GKRS and a CPI. Ten patients were treated with Ipilimumab, ten with Pembrolizumab, and one with Nivolumab. Matched patients had no statistically significant differences in age, gender, performance status, extracranial disease burden, prior radiation, peri-SRS steroid use, number of brain lesions or total brain tumor volume treated. Patients treated with concurrent CPIs and SRS were significantly more likely to have any post-treatment increases in T1 post-contrast and T2-FLAIR volumes (52 vs 19%; P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in rates of adverse radiation effects, steroid use at follow-up, or decompressive craniotomies. There were also no significant differences in local control, distant brain failure, or rates of salvage whole brain radiation or SRS. There was a non-significant improvement in median overall survival (OS) with concurrent CPIs compared with matched controls (11.6 vs 8.8 months, P = 0.80) and a significantly longer median OS than predicted by Diagnosis-Specific GPA (DS-GPA) scores (11.6 vs 4.7 months, P = 0.05).1 Median OS for matched controls was not significantly different than that predicted by their DS-GPA scores. Conclusion(s): Melanoma patients with brain metastases treated concurrently with SRS and CPIs are more likely than patients treated with SRS alone to demonstrate imaging changes without apparent clinical consequences. No differences in disease outcomes were found based on CPI use, however median OS was better than predicted for patients treated concurrently with SRS and CPIs.",Excluded
1900,"Impact of gallium-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT on management of neuroendocrine tumors Methods Overall 40 patients (25 men and 15 women, age: 50+/-9 years) with clinical / biochemical suspicion or histologicaly proven Neuroendocrine tumors underwent <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT. 21 patients (52.5%) came with recently diagnosed primary NET. 17 patients (42.5%) presented with NET metastases from carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUPS). 2 patients presented with raised gastrin levels. Results Ga-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT showed sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 92.5%, respectively, for primary tumor and 98.5% and 100% for metastases. It was better than a conventional imaging modality for the detection of both primary tumor (p < 0.001) and metastases (p < 0.0001). It changed the management strategy in 22 patients (55%). On the basis of the results, 11 patients (27.5%) underwent surgery for primary lesions for surgically resectable loco regional disease. Five patients (12.5 %) detected with advanced stage of disease on PET were spared unnecessary surgery. Six patients (15%) with poor 68Ga-DOTA-NOC uptake were spared unnecessary octreotide therapy and were started on systemic chemotherapy. In addition, the detection of the expression of somatostatin receptors led to octreotide-based treatments in 25 patients. Conclusions 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT provides incremental diagnostic information compared to conventional imaging. It has significant impact in management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Extent of disease defined by Ga-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT can alter the surgical management of these patients. The detection of a high degree of somatostatin receptor expression can be exploited to treat patients with octreotide therapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and, conversely, a negative finding on 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/ CT can guide the treating physician to choose an alternate form of treatment. Additional benefit of 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT include patient convenience with short time acquisition and lower radiation exposure signifying the important role of 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET CT in clinical practice of neuroendocrine malignancies.",Excluded
1239,"Induced radioactivity in the blood of cancer patients following Boron Neutron Capture Therapy Since 1990, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) has been used for over 400 cancer patients at the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURRI). After BNCT, the patients are radioactive and their (24)Na and (38)Cl levels can be detected via a Na-I scintillation counter. This activity is predominantly due to (24)Na, which has a half-life of 14.96 h and thus remains in the body for extended time periods. Radioactive (24)Na is mainly generated from (23)Na in the target tissue that is exposed to the neutron beam in BNCT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the radioactivity of blood (24)Na following BNCT and the absorbed gamma ray dose in the irradiated field. To assess blood (24)Na, 1 ml of peripheral blood was collected from 30 patients immediately after the exposure, and the radioactivity of blood (24)Na was determined using a germanium counter. The activity of (24)Na in the blood correlated with the absorbed gamma ray doses in the irradiated field. For the same absorbed gamma ray dose in the irradiated field, the activity of blood (24)Na was higher in patients with neck or lung tumors than in patients with brain or skin tumors. The reasons for these findings are not readily apparent, but the difference in the blood volume and the ratio of bone to soft tissue in the irradiated field, as well as the dose that leaked through the clinical collimator, may be responsible.",Excluded

SWOG 1404 Background: Adjuvant therapy for melanoma has centered on high dose interferon for now almost 20 years. Recently, the FDA approved ipilimumab dosed at 10 mg/kg (10/kg ipi) for use in high risk resected melanoma. Though these two treatment options are available they still have limits in terms of efficacy with approximately 1 year of relapse free survival benefit (HDI and 10/kg ipi) and a modest overall survival benefit (HDI). Toxicity remains an issue as well with both therapies. S1404 is a Phase III, open label trial which seeks to compare currently available FDA approved treatments to one year of pembrolizumab in patients at high risk of relapse and death after surgery. Study Design: 1,378 patients will be randomized 1:1 to an FDA approved standard therapy, or pembrolizumab. Stratification factors include PDL1 staining status, clinical stage, and prerandomization selected standard treatment option. Patient(s): Patients must be 18 or older, and have Stage IIIA (n2), IIIB, IIIC or IV (M1a, b and c) resected melanoma to be eligible. Exclusion factors include brain metastases, ocular primary, and autoimmune disease. Prior therapy is not allowed, but radiation as adjuvant treatment is considered an option available to patients prior to treatment.

2214,"Improved plan quality with automated radiotherapy planning for whole brain with hippocampus sparing: a comparison to the RTOG 0933 trial BACKGROUND: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) with hippocampus sparing (HS) has been investigated by the radiation oncology working group (RTOG) 0933 trial for patients with multiple brain metastases. They showed a decrease of adverse neurocognitive effects with HS WBRT compared to WBRT alone. With the development of automated treatment planning system (aTPS) in the last years, a standardization of the plan quality at a high level was achieved. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using an aTPS for the treatment of HS WBRT and see if the RTOG 0933 dose constraints could be achieved and improved.METHODS: Ten consecutive patients treated with HS WBRT were enrolled in this study. 10 x 3 Gy was prescribed according to the RTOG 0933 protocol to 92% of the target volume (whole-brain excluding the hippocampus expanded by 5 mm in 3-dimensions). In contrast to RTOG 0933, the maximum allowed point dose to normal brain was significantly lowered and restricted to 36.5 Gy. All patients were planned with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique using four arcs. Plans were optimized using Auto-Planning (AP) (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems) with one single AP template and optimization.RESULTS: All the constraints from the RTOG 0933 trial were achieved. A significant improvement for the maximal dose to 2% of the brain with a reduction of 4 Gy was achieved (33.5 Gy vs. RTOG 37.5 Gy) and the minimum hippocampus dose was reduced by 10% (8.1 Gy vs. RTOG 9 Gy). A steep dose gradient around the hippocampus was achieved with a mean dose of 27.3 Gy at a distance between 0.5 cm and 1 cm from the hippocampus. The effective working time to optimize a plan was kept below 6'.CONCLUSION: Automated treatment planning for HS WBRT was able to fulfil all the recommendations from the RTOG 0933 study while significantly improving dose homogeneity and decreasing unnecessary hot spot in the normal brain. With this approach, a standardization of plan quality was achieved and the effective time required for plan optimization was minimized.",Excluded
1341,"Review article: cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy in adults: a work in progress Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has potential as a noninvasive brain monitor across a spectrum of disorders. In the last decade, there has been a rapid expansion of clinical experience using NIRS to monitor cerebral oxygenation, and there is some evidence that NIRS-guided brain protection protocols might lead to a reduction in perioperative neurologic complications after cardiac surgery. However, there are no data to support the wider application of NIRS during routine surgery under general anesthesia, and its application in brain injury, where it might be expected to have a key monitoring role, is undefined. Although increasingly sophisticated apparatuses, including broadband and time-resolved spectroscopy systems, provide insights into the potential of NIRS to measure regional cerebral oxygenation, hemodynamics, and metabolism in real-time, these innovations have yet to translate into effective monitor-guided brain protection treatment strategies. NIRS has many potential advantages over other neuromonitoring techniques, but further investigation and technological advances are necessary before it can be introduced more widely into clinical practice.",Excluded

The addition of temozolomide(TMZ) to standard of care was supported by the 2005 Stuppstudy, which reported a median survival of 14.6 months.However, variation exists between and within patientpopulations. We examined three geographically distinctCanadian patient populations and evaluated the role of variousprognostic factors. Method(s): Patients with GBM were identified at threeCanadian centres, in two Canadian provinces, from prospectivelycollected databases of population-based neuro-oncology centres(years 2001-2008). Biopsy or extensive surgical debulking of thetumor was undertaken followed by RT, or RT with concomitantTMZ followed by 6-12 cycles of TMZ. MGMT promotermethylation status was assessed when possible. Result(s): A total of 757 patients were analyzed from threecentres: Calgary (n=352), Edmonton (n=211), and Halifax(n=194). The mean age was 60 years, 64% were male, and theoverall median survival was nine months with no differenceamong sites (p=0.90).

1438,"Combination of pGL1-TNF-alpha gene and radiation (proton and gamma-ray) therapy against brain tumor The major goal of this study was to determine if treatment with the newly constructed plasmid vector for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (pGL1-TNF-alpha) could enhance the radiation-induced growth reduction of C6 rat glioma. In addition, two different forms of ionizing radiation (gamma-rays and protons) were utilized. Body and spleen mass, leukocyte blastogenesis, and flow cytometry analysis of cell populations in blood and spleen were performed to detect toxicity, if any, and to identify mechanisms that may correlate with the anti-tumor action of combination therapy. C6 tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice and allowed to become established before treatment initiation. pGL1-TNF-alpha was injected into the implanted tumors, which were then irradiated 16-18 hr later; each modality was administered three times over 8-9 days. The addition of pGL1-TNF-alpha significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of radiation (p < 0.05). The effect was more than additive, since pGL1-TNF-alpha alone did not slow tumor progression and radiation alone had only a modest effect. Administration of pGL1-TNF-alpha together with proton radiation resulted in tumor volumes that were 23% smaller than those following pGL1-TNF-alpha + gamma-ray treatment; a similar differential in tumor size was observed in the groups receiving only radiation. Body weights and blood and spleen cell analyses did not reveal treatment-related toxicity. High basal proliferation of blood leukocytes and increased B cell levels in the spleen were associated with pGL1-TNF-alpha + 60Co (gamma-radiation) or proton treatment. Overall, the results suggest that the pGL1-TNF-alpha/radiation combination is effective and safe under the conditions employed. This is the first study to combine gene and proton radiation therapy and to show, under controlled experimental conditions, that proton radiation may have a greater effect against malignant tumors compared to the same physical dose of gamma-radiation.",Excluded
1378,"Frequent occurrence of therapeutically reversible CMV-associated encephalopathy during radiotherapy of the brain BACKGROUND: Neurological decline during radio(chemo)therapy of the brain is often attributed to disease progression or side effects of radiotherapy. Diagnosis of opportunistic neurotropic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections is uncommon, even though high-grade gliomas and some brain metastases are known to contain CMV particles. We prospectively examined the frequency of CMV encephalopathy during radiotherapy of the brain.METHODS: Fifty patients requiring whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases (n = 27) or local radio(chemo)therapy of the brain for high-grade gliomas (n = 23) were observed in the prospective observational GLIO-CMV-01 study. MRIs and blood samples were obtained before, halfway through, and at the end of radiotherapy. MRIs were screened for disease progression or increased intracranial pressure. Blood was tested for anti-CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)M, anti-CMV IgG, and CMV DNA.RESULTS: Thirty-two of 50 (64%) patients were positive for anti-CMV IgG before radio(chemo)therapy. Fifteen of those 32 (48%) developed viremia during or up to 28 days after treatment. Thirteen of those 15 (87%) required treatment for CMV-associated encephalopathy. MRIs were negative for disease progression, edema, or bleeding. None of the patients negative for anti-CMV IgG developed viremia, suggesting a reactivation rather than a primary infection. In the group at risk consisting of anti-CMV IgG+ patients, age >65 (P = .004) and the amount of dexamethasone taken during radio(chemo)therapy (P = .004) were associated with an increased risk for CMV-associated encephalopathy. One hundred and fifty days after the start of radio(chemo)therapy, survival was 74% (14/19) (no encephalopathy) versus 54% (7/13) (encephalopathy) (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.03-1.86; P = .25).CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation frequently causes encephalopathy during radio(chemo)therapy of the brain.

In the present study, 99 animals were irradiated stereotactically at the right frontal lobe using a linear accelerator and single doses between 26 and 50 Gy. The diameter of the spherical dose distribution was 4.7 mm (80% isodose).

The dependence of the dose-response curves on the follow-up time and the definition of the biological end point were determined. Tolerance doses were calculated at several effect probability levels and times after irradiation. The MRI changes were found to be dependent on dose and progressive in time. At 20 months, the tolerance doses at a 50% effect probability level were 39.6 +/- 1.0 Gy and 42.4 +/- 1.4 Gy for changes in T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively.

2296,"The partial alpha7 nicotine acetylcholine receptor agonist S 24795 enhances long-term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses in the adult mouse hippocampus The effects of S 24795, a newly developed partial agonist at alpha7 nAChRs, were tested on synaptic transmission and plasticity using extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked in the CA1 region by Schaffer collateral stimulation in hippocampal slices obtained from adult mice. S 24795 reduced the amplitude of the fEPSPs in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) of 127 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1.1. The reduction in amplitude of the fEPSPs started at S 24795 concentrations higher than 3muM and reached 71% of controls at 300 microM. This effect was mediated by alpha7 nAChRs since it was blocked by nAChR antagonists and was not observed in alpha7 -/- mice. This effect was probably due to a reduction in glutamate release from presynaptic terminals since it was associated with a significant increase in the paired pulse ratio. In addition, S 24795 (100 microM) significantly reduced the frequency, but not the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, recorded in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (in voltage clamp mode), further supporting a presynaptic site of action of S 24795. In addition, S 24795 at 3 microM, a concentration that did not affect basic synaptic transmission, potentiated LTP. This effect was mediated by alpha7 nAChRs since it was prevented by MLA (10 nM) and was absent in alpha7 -/- mice. Galantamine an allosteric modulator of nAChRs, at the concentrations of 0.3-3 microM, failed to potentiate LTP.

All patients were arbitrarily chosen from a set of previously treated patients irradiated with a two- or three-field technique using customised blocks. Appropriate wedge angles and beam weights were chosen to make the dose distribution as homogeneous as possible.RESULTS: The dose at the ICRU reference point was generally higher than the mean dose to the PTV. The difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV for an individual patient was less than 3% in 88% of cases and less than 2% in 72% of the cases. The differences were larger in those patients where the dose distribution is significantly influenced by the presence of lungs or air gaps. For each series of patients the mean difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV was calculated. The difference between these two values never exceeded 2%. Because not all planning systems are able to calculate the mean dose to the PTV, the concept of the mean central dose, the mean of the dose values at the centre of the PTV in each CT slice, has been introduced. The mean central dose was also calculated for the same patients and was closer to the mean dose to the PTV than the ICRU reference dose.CONCLUSION: The mean dose to the PTV is well estimated by either the ICRU reference dose or the mean central dose for a variety of treatment techniques for common types of cancer.",Excluded

2086,"Targeted disruption of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene in miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a genetic disease caused by germline biallelic mutation in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) that results in partial or complete loss of ATM expression or activity. A diverse phenotype of the disease includes progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, radiation hypersensitivity, increased cancer incidence, immunodeficiency and chromosomal instability. The frequency of A-T in the United States and United Kingdom has been estimated to be 1:40 000. Heterozygous carriers may also have predisposition to diverse cancers. Although ATM-deficient mice have been produced, none reflects the extent of neurological abnormalities involving the loss of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum seen in patients. Hence, miniature pigs, which are anatomically and physiologically closer to humans, might serve as an alternative model for human A-T. In the present study, we attempted a targeted disruption of ATM in miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Most A-T patients possess mutated ATM with truncation, resulting in prematurely terminated ATM proteins that are highly unstable. To induce the truncation of ATM, we disrupted exon 59 region of ATM that has been known to be critical for ATM kinase activity. Miniature pig fetal fibroblasts were transfected with ATM-targeting vector and treated by neomycin for 2 weeks. A total of 139 colonies were screened by PCR and 3 among them were identified as homologous recombinants with monoallelic disruption of ATM (targeting efficiency=2.1%). One of the 3 colonies was chosen and used for subsequent nuclear transfer. In total, 611 nuclear transfer embryos reconstructed with ATM-targeted fetal fibroblasts were transferred into 5 surrogate gilts. Two gilts became pregnant and developed to term with a total of 5 live piglets delivered. Being analysed by PCR, all piglets born were found to be ATM gene-targeted. Because conventional murine models of human A-T have provided only limited insights into therapies and pharmacological treatments, the generation of miniature pigs with disrupted ATM will allow new opportunities to more precisely understand A-T and to accelerate discovery of strategies for prevention and treatment of the disease. In addition, such animals may be utilised in studying cancer with respect to the involvement of ATM in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis.",Excluded

A battery of three different tests measured attention and short-term memory. Task 1 involved alternately selecting black digits from 1 to 25 in ascending order and white digits from 24 to 1 in descending order. The time spent on the task and the number of errors were recorded and analysed. Task 2 involved viewing a picture of 12 objects during 3 s, followed by a list of 24 words. The subject was required to select words representing previously presented objects. In task 3, an array of letters in 10 rows (60 in each row) was presented, and the subject was required to identify all examples of a particular two-letter combination.RESULTS: The results of tasks 1 and 3 showed a significant increase in variances of errors (p<0.05) in the exposed versus the sham-exposed group.

1450,"The spatial pattern of light determines the kinetics and modulates backpropagation of optogenetic action potentials Optogenetics offers an unprecedented ability to spatially target neuronal stimulations. This study investigated via simulation, for the first time, how the spatial pattern of excitation affects the response of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expressing neurons. First we described a methodology for modeling ChR2 in the NEURON simulation platform. Then, we compared four most commonly considered illumination strategies (somatic, dendritic, axonal and whole cell) in a paradigmatic model of a cortical layer V pyramidal cell. We show that the spatial pattern of illumination has an important impact on the efficiency of stimulation and the kinetics of the spiking output. Whole cell illumination synchronizes the depolarization of the dendritic tree and the soma and evokes spiking characteristics with a distinct pattern including an increased bursting rate and enhanced back propagation of action potentials (bAPs). This type of illumination is the most efficient as a given irradiance threshold was achievable with only 6 % of ChR2 density needed in the case of somatic illumination. Targeting only the axon initial segment requires a high ChR2 density to achieve a given threshold irradiance and a prolonged illumination does not yield sustained spiking. We also show that patterned illumination can be used to modulate the bAPs and hence spatially modulate the direction and amplitude of spike time dependent plasticity protocols. We further found the irradiance threshold to increase in proportion to the demyelination level of an axon, suggesting that measurements of the irradiance threshold (for example relative to the soma) could be used to remotely probe a loss of neural myelin sheath, which is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases.",Excluded
2388,"Initial Gamma Knife radiosurgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas OBJECT: Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) are the most common type of pituitary adenoma and, when symptomatic, typically require surgical removal as an initial means of management. Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an alternative therapeutic strategy for patients whose comorbidities substantially increase the risks of resection. In this report, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of initial GKRS for NFAs.METHODS: An international group of three academic Gamma Knife centers retrospectively reviewed outcome data in 569 patients with NFAs.RESULTS: Forty-one patients (7.2%) underwent GKRS as primary management for their NFAs because of an advanced age, multiple comorbidities, or patient preference. The median age at the time of radiosurgery was 69 years. Thirty-seven percent of the patients had hypopituitarism before GKRS. Patients received a median tumor margin dose of 12 Gy (range 6.2-25.0 Gy) at a median isodose of 50%. The overall tumor control rate was 92.7%, and the actuarial tumor control rate was 94% and 85% at 5 and 10 years postradiosurgery, respectively. Three patients with tumor growth or symptom progression underwent resection at 3, 3, and 96 months after GKRS, respectively. New or worsened hypopituitarism developed in 10 patients (24%) at a median interval of 37 months after GKRS. One patient suffered new-onset cranial nerve palsy. No other radiosurgical complications were noted. Delayed hypopituitarism was observed more often in patients who had received a tumor margin dose > 18 Gy (p = 0.038) and a maximum dose > 36 Gy (p = 0.025).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, GKRS resulted in long-term control of NFAs in 85% of patients at 10 years. This experience suggests that GKRS provides long-term tumor control with an acceptable risk profile. This approach may be especially valuable in older patients, those with multiple comorbidities, and those who have endocrine-inactive tumors without visual compromise due to mass effect of the adenoma.",Excluded
2504,"Treatment of spinal cord ependymomas by surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of complete resection and postoperative radiotherapy in spinal cord ependymomas. Methods and materials: We conducted a retrospective study over 20 patients (13 males and 7 females) with histologically confirmed spinal cord ependymomas between July 1985 and April 2001. Among them, 13 patients had ependymomas, 6 had myxopapillary ependymomas, and 1 had anaplastic ependymoma. All patients received radical surgery for tumor removal with 13 patients achieving complete resection and 7 incomplete resection due to technical difficulty. Among those with incomplete resection, 6 patients received postoperative radiotherapy to tumor bed and only one patient with anaplastic ependymoma received surgery alone. The total tumor dose ranged from 50 to 60 Gy. Result(s): Among the 20 patients, 19 patients were alive and showed local control. The median survival time of all patients was 109 months, with 104 months in the complete resection alone group and 135 months in the incomplete resection with postoperative radiotherapy group. One patient with anaplastic ependymoma and no postoperative radiotherapy developed leptomeningeal seeding 9 months after surgery. Salvage therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy maintained normal neurological functions. The patient expired 34 months from the initial diagnosis due to progression of leptomeningeal seeding. Conclusion(s): Complete resection alone in spinal cord ependymoma can achieve excellent local control and survival. Patients should receive complete resection if technically possible. Postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended for complete resection. For incomplete resection, postoperative local radiotherapy is recommended and it can also achieve excellent local control and survival. Local radiotherapy with 50-60 Gy is effective and safe. Salvage radiotherapy improves quality of life for local recurrence or leptomeningeal seeding patients. Â© Springer 2005.",Included

However, previous reports are limited by small patient population. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological data of 53 patients with CMs of basal ganglia and thalamus who underwent GKRS at West China Hospital between May 2009 and July 2018. All patients suffered at least once bleeding before GKRS. The mean volume of these lesions was 1.77 cm, and the mean marginal dose was 13.2 Gy. After treatment, patients were followed to determine the change in symptom and hemorrhage event. Result(s): The mean follow-up period was 52.1 months (6.2-104.3 months). The calculated annual hemorrhage rate (AHR) was 48.5% prior to GKRS and 3.0% after treatment (p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 2-, 3-, and 5-year hemorrhage-free survival were 88, 80.9, and 80.9%, respectively. Preexisting symptoms were resolved in 11 patients, improved in 14, and stable in 5. Only 2 patients (3.8%) developed new neurological deficit. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that AHR after GKRS was comparable to the recorded AHR of natural history (3.1-4.1%) in previous studies. GKRS is a safe and effective treatment modality for CMs of basal ganglia and thalamus. Considering the relative insufficient understanding of natural history of CMs, future study warrants longer follow-up. Â© 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.",Excluded

1639,"Regulation of neurite outgrowth by intermittent irradiation of visible light The effect of neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells on collagen-coated glass plates under intermittent light irradiation at 525 nm and 0.4 mW/cm2 of intensity was investigated. Neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was significantly suppressed when PC12 cells were cultivated under intermittent light irradiation with a total irradiation time of more than 2 min/h. No temperature increase was observed in the culture medium under either continuous or intermittent light irradiation. Therefore, suppression of neurite outgrowth under light irradiation was not due to the increase of temperature in the culture medium, but rather the effect of light on the PC12 cells, especially the signal transmittance of light to PC12 cells. The light irradiation interval also affected the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells when the total irradiation time was constant. A high extension ratio of neurite outgrowth was observed under a long time interval of nonirradiation between light irradiations (1 min of irradiation every hour) as compared with frequent light irradiation intervals (5 s of irradiation every 5 min) with the same total irradiation period per hour. The neurite outgrowth ratio was thought to be dependent on the light intensity, the total time of light irradiation in the intermittent light irradiation, and the interval of light irradiation in the intermittent light irradiation.",Excluded
2353,"Advances in the treatment of metastatic spine tumors: The future is not what it used to be An improved understanding of tumor biology, the ability to target tumor drivers, and the ability to harness the immune system have dramatically improved the expected survival of patients diagnosed with cancer. However, many patients continue to develop spine metastases that require local treatment with radiotherapy and surgery. Fortunately, the evolution of radiation delivery and operative techniques permits durable tumor control with a decreased risk of treatment-related toxicity and a greater emphasis on restoration of quality of life and daily function. Stereotactic body radiotherapy allows delivery of ablative radiation doses to the majority of spine tumors, reducing the need for surgery. Among patients who still require surgery for decompression of the spinal cord or spinal column stabilization, minimal access approaches and targeted tumor excision and ablation techniques minimize the surgical risk and facilitate postoperative recovery. Growing interdisciplinary collaboration among scientists and clinicians will further elucidate the synergistic possibilities among systemic, radiation, and surgical interventions for patients with spinal tumors and will bring many closer to curative therapies.

1328,"Primary CNS lymphoma Primary CNS lymphoma, an uncommon form of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, has increased in incidence and occurs in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Primary CNS lymphoma in immunocompetent patients is associated with unique diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic issues and the management of this malignancy is different from other forms of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Characteristic imaging features should lead to suspicion of the diagnosis, avoidance of corticosteroids (if possible) and early neurosurgical consultation for stereotactic biopsy. Since primary CNS lymphoma may involve the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and eyes, diagnostic evaluation should include assessment of all of these regions as well as screening for the possibility of occult systemic disease. Resection provides no therapeutic benefit and should be reserved for the rare patient with neurological deterioration due to brain herniation. Whole-brain radiation therapy alone is insufficient for durable tumor control and is associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity in patients over 60 years of age. Neurotoxicity is typically associated with significant cognitive, motor and autonomic dysfunction and has a negative impact on quality of life. Chemotherapy and whole-brain radiation therapy together improve tumor response rates and survival compared with whole-brain radiation therapy alone. Methotrexate-based multiagent chemotherapy without whole-brain radiation therapy is associated with similar tumor response rates and survival compared with regimens that include whole-brain radiation therapy, although controlled trials have not been performed. The risk of neurotoxicity is lower in patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The incidence of HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma has decreased in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Patients with HIV-associated primary CNS lymphoma have a worse prognosis but may respond to highly active antiretroviral therapy, whole-brain radiation therapy or therapies directed against the Epstein-Barr virus.

Guillain-Barre syndrome/acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy causes paresthesias and weakness, which can make the treatment of lymphoma with chemotherapy challenging. Given the rarity of this co-presentation it is not known if the effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome should be considered when selecting a treatment regimen for Hodgkin lymphoma. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of these treatment modifications has not been previously reported. Case presentation: We report the case of a 37-year-old Caucasian man with a diagnosis of stage IIB classical Hodgkin lymphoma with concomitant Guillain-Barre syndrome. Our patient originally presented with an enlarged cervical lymph node and quickly developed distal paresthesia and progressive weakness of all four extremities. He was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and initiated on treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. Doses of bleomycin and vinblastine were held or dose-reduced throughout his initial treatment course due to underlying neuropathy and dyspnea. He continued to have persistent disease after five cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine and went on to receive salvage treatments including more chemotherapy, radiation, autologous stem cell transplant and is currently preparing for an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Conclusion(s): Paraneoplastic syndromes such as Guillain-Barre syndrome/acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy can make the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma more challenging and can interfere with delivering full-dose chemotherapy. Further case series are needed to evaluate the effect that paraneoplastic syndromes, or adjustments made in therapy due to these syndromes, negatively affect the prognosis of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

1851,"CRF-like receptor SEB-3 in sex-common interneurons potentiates stress handling and reproductive drive in C. elegans Environmental conditions can modulate innate behaviours. Although male Caenorhabditis elegans copulation can be perturbed in the presence of stress, the mechanisms underlying its decision to sustain copulation are unclear. Here we describe a mating interference assay, which quantifies the persistence of male C. elegans copulation in noxious blue light. We show that between copulations, the male escapes from blue light illumination at intensities over 370 muW mm(-2). This response is attenuated in mutants with constitutive activation of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor family homologue SEB-3. We show that activation of this receptor causes sex-common glutamatergic lumbar ganglion interneurons (LUA) to potentiate downstream male-specific reproduction circuits, allowing copulatory behaviours to partially override the light-induced escape responses in the male. SEB-3 activation in LUA also potentiates copulation during mild starvation. We suggest that SEB-3 activation allows C. elegans to acclimate to the environment and thus continue to execute innate behaviours even under non-optimal conditions.",Excluded

The operation was performed on normal polar CE by sucking in an extra plug of acid following a sample zone, serving as a selective acid barrage to block the backward migration of weak anionic analytes due to a sudden mobility reduction via acid-base reaction which does not affect strong coions such as Cl<sup>-</sup> to penetrate the barrage freely. By CE-UV of FMOC-AAs in various NaCl solutions, the effectiveness of ABS was firmly validated, able to stand up to 500 mM NaCl and to stack analytes by 10<sup>3</sup>-fold calculated from the UV detection limits, that is 0.01 muM for ABS and 10 muM for non-stacking injection. The method was also validated by determining trace Glu and Asp in real samples of rat brain microdialysate, rat serum and human saliva. The intraday RSDs were 0.33-4.9% for migration time and 1.8-9.6% for peak area. The recoveries measured by spiking technique were 82-115% for Glu and 86-116% for Asp. Working equations were obtained by plotting peak height vs. concentration at 0.1-50 muM with correlation coefficients of >0.999. The contents of Glu and Asp were thus found at 0.26-0.83 muM and 0.24-0.64 muM respectively, in rat brain microdialyste; 37-40 muM and 8.4-10 muM, respectively, in rat serum; and 3.5-5.8 muM and 1.0-4.1 muM. respectively in human saliva.

1232,"Stereotactic LINAC radiosurgery for the treatment of brainstem cavernomas BACKGROUND: The management of deep-seated cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) is still controversial. Although surgery remains the treatment of choice in patients with recurrent hemorrhage, patients with CCMs located in the brainstem are in many cases not eligible for resection due to high procedure-related morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the long-term outcome of LINAC radiosurgery (LINAC-RS) for the treatment of brainstem CCMs.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1992 and March 2008, 14 patients (6 men, 8 women) harboring brainstem CCMs underwent LINAC-RS. Pretreatment neuroimaging showed no associated developmental venous angiomas (DVAs) in any of our patients. Prior to treatment, all patients suffered at least from one symptomatic hemorrhage (median 1.8, range 1-3). A median follow-up of 7.1 years (range 2.0-16.8 years) could be obtained in 12 patients. We applied a median tumor surface dose of 13.9 Gy (range 11-18 Gy; median tumor volume 1.6 ml, range 0.4-4.3 ml).RESULTS: Following LINAC-RS, neurological outcome improved in 4 (33.3%) and remained unchanged in 8 patients (66.7%). Rebleeding with subsequent transient neurological status deterioration occurred in 4 patients (33.3%), leading to additional surgical resection in 2 patients (16.7%). The corresponding annual hemorrhage rate was 4.8% (4/82.8 patient-years). Adverse radiation effects (ARE, defined by perilesional hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR images) were revealed in 3 patients (25%), leading to transient neurological deficits in 2 patients (16.7%). There were no procedure-related complications leading to either permanent morbidity or mortality.CONCLUSION: Our results support the role of LINAC-RS as an efficient and safe treatment to significantly reduce the annual hemorrhage rate in patients suffering from brainstem CCMs not eligible to microsurgery.

All of the drugs increased resistance to stressful coriolis stimulation by 80-120%. Methylphenidate and pemoline showed fewer side effects.

2273,"State-dependent bidirectional modification of somatic inhibition in neocortical pyramidal cells Cortical pyramidal neurons alter their responses to input signals depending on behavioral state. We investigated whether changes in somatic inhibition contribute to these alterations. In layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat visual cortex, repetitive firing from a depolarized membrane potential, which typically occurs during arousal, produced long-lasting depression of somatic inhibition. In contrast, slow membrane oscillations with firing in the depolarized phase, which typically occurs during slow-wave sleep, produced long-lasting potentiation. The depression is mediated by L-type Ca2+ channels and GABA(A) receptor endocytosis, whereas potentiation is mediated by R-type Ca2+ channels and receptor exocytosis. It is likely that the direction of modification is mainly dependent on the ratio of R- and L-type Ca2+ channel activation. Furthermore, somatic inhibition was stronger in slices prepared from rats during slow-wave sleep than arousal. This bidirectional modification of somatic inhibition may alter pyramidal neuron responsiveness in accordance with behavioral state.",Excluded
2309,"The influence of fibroblast on the arachnoid leptomeningeal cells in vitro OBJECTIVE: Fibroblast is pervasive in the setting of injury. Its invasion into the arachnoid tissue causes scarring, cortical adhesion of the brain, and obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow. The purpose of this study is to determine the phenotypic and physiologic effects of fibroblasts on arachnoid in culture.METHODS: We studied the effects of fibroblast on the arachnoid cell growth, motility, phenotypic changes, and transport properties. Immortalized rat (Rattus norvegicus, Sprague Dawley breed) arachnoid cells were grown with fibroblast on opposite sides of polyethylene membranes or co-cultured in plastic wells. Arachnoid cell growth rate and DNA content, morphology, transport physiology, and extracellular matriceal content were determined in the presence of normal and irradiated fibroblast cells.RESULTS: When arachnoid cells were grown in the presence of fibroblasts, mannitol permeability increased and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) decreased. Arachnoid cell growth rate also significantly decreased. When arachnoid cells were grown in close proximity (i.e. on the same monolayer) with fibroblasts, the arachnoid cells were overrun by day 2, yet when physically separated, no significant change was seen in growth. Apoptosis increased markedly in arachnoid cultures in the presence of fibroblast. Fibroblast caused arachnoid cell to exhibit avoidance behavior, and irradiated fibroblast induced arachnoidal cells to move faster and exhibited greater directional changes. Subcellular glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content was significantly altered by fibroblast.INTERPRETATION: Fibroblasts influence arachnoid cell's mannitol transport likely via soluble factors. While the arachnoid cells did not change morphologically, cell growth was influenced. Over time, the cells had profound changes in transport and motility.

The average planning target volume dose ranged from 30 to 61 Gy (W), and the average normal brain dose from 3 to 6 Gy (W). The treatment was generally well tolerated, and none of the patients have died during the first months following BNCT. The estimated 1-year overall survival is 61%. In another trial (protocol P-03), three patients with recurring or progressing glioblastoma following surgery and conventional cranial radiotherapy to 50-60 Gy, were treated with BPA-based BNCT using the BPA dosage of 290 mg/kg. The average planning target dose in these patients was 25-29 Gy (W), and the average whole brain dose 2-3 Gy (W). All three patients tolerated brain reirradiation with BNCT, and none died during the first three months following BNCT. We conclude that BPA-based BNCT has been relatively well tolerated both in previously irradiated and unirradiated glioblastoma patients. Efficacy comparisons with conventional photon radiation are difficult due to patient selection and confounding factors such as other treatments given, but the results support continuation of clinical research on BPA-based BNCT.",Excluded
1473,"Clinical features of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis Carotid arteries frequently receive significant incidental doses of radiation during the treatment of malignant diseases, including head and neck cancer, breast cancer and lymphoma. Vascular injury after treatment may result in carotid artery stenosis and increased risk of neurological sequelae, such as stroke and transient ischaemic attack. The long latent interval from treatment to the development of clinical complications makes investigation of this process difficult, particularly in regard to the design of interventional clinical studies. Nevertheless, there is compelling clinical evidence that radiation contributes to carotid atherosclerosis. This overview examines the effect of radiotherapy on the carotid arteries, the underlying pathological processes and their clinical manifestations. The use of serum biomarkers in risk-prediction models and the potential value of new imaging techniques as tools for defining earlier surrogate end points will also be discussed.",Excluded

In the case of a pregnant woman it is a serious injury at as time of maximum personal and family development. Although theoretically cerebral apoplexy has very varied aethiopathological causes there are many young women in whom the principal cause is never found. The clinical neurological investigation needs to be supported by radiological diagnostic techniques to make an initial diagnosis between ischaemic or haemorrhage pathology. Cranial tomography will be indicated by the same criteria as in non pregnant patients, without threatening embryonic or foetal viability. The dosage of radiation used does not endanger foetal well-being, and it should help us try to predict maternal prognosis and to establish the most appropriate therapy.",Excluded

The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 59.2+/-10.9; 50% were smokers and with history of atopy in 5 of them. Five patients had a cancer (2 cuteneous, 1 hematological, 1 ginecological and 1 neuroendocrine). Diagnosis of RF was made with CT, histology, ultrasonography or MRI (respectively in 10, 3, 2 and 1 patients). Seven patients underwent PET, that showed a pathologic enhancement in retroperitoneal and periaortic lesions. Four patients had an histological diagnosis of IgG4 related disease. Mean duration of follow-up was 33 months. Result(s): At the time of the diagnosis, the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 54.2+/-27.6 ml/min and 14 patients had an impaired renal function. Six patients presented also hydroureteronephrosis that worsened the renal function (mean eGFR 32.2+/-16.9), with ureteral stenting requirement. After resolution of ureteral stenosis there was a significant recovery (mean eGFR 56.9+/-23), comparable to the patient that did not required the stent. Only 1 patient required dialysis for hyperpotassemia before positioning ureteral stent. the mean value of plasmatic IgG was 1638+/-1000 mg/dL (normal range 700-1600 mg/dl), resulting high for 5 patients. The mean IgG4 concentration was 391.6+/-585.8 mg/dL, higher than normal range in 50% of patients. For 12 patients we calculated IgG4/IgG ratio, an index suggested by some authors as a potential tool to discriminate patient with RF linked to IgG4 related disease. Three patients had an IgG4/IgG ratio <8% and 9 patients >8%. In our cohort, the IgG4/IgG ratio presented a direct correlation (p=0,009) with extraperitoneal manifestations of the IgG4 related disease, such as pancreatitis, colangitis, encephalitis and ocular involvement. One patient showed modest eosinophilia and almost 43% of patients had positive antinuclear antibodies. C3 and C4 component fractions were low in 2 patients who had highest levels of IgG4 and IgG4/IgG ratio and severe systemic involvement. Erythrosedimentation rate and C-protein reactive were almost normal (respectively mean values 44.8 mm and 1.63 mg/dl). Conclusion(s): almost all of the patients (87,5 %) showed impaired renal function. Kidney involvement did not seem to be linked just to obstructive uropathy. In fact after stenting, eGFR values were comparable in the 2 groups (obstructed vs not-obstructed). Further evaluations are required to better understand the renal impairment and the physiopathology of RF. Our data would suggest that RF might have a direct impact on renal function probably due to igG4 related disease.",Excluded

Beta-particle PRRT using <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-tyr -octreotate ( <sup>11</sup>Lu- DOTATATE) has been shown to significantly improve progression-free survival for NET patients compared to the standard of care treatment in a Phase 3 trial (1). However, the overall response rate is limited and complete responses are rare. Emerging evidence suggests that alpha-particle PRRT (alpha-PRRT) has the potential to improve tumor response. However, concerns regarding potential toxicities to normal organs and tissues (e.g., kidneys, bone marrow) mandate development and evaluation of personalized dosimetric approaches which can be used in clinical studies to reduce these toxicities. In this study, we evaluated potential renal and bone marrow toxicities arising from <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTA-tyr -octreotide ( <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC) in an animal model. A dosimetry study was performed on each animal with the aim of examining the relationship between localized <sup>212</sup>Pb alpha+beta dose to kidneys (a dose-limiting organ for beta PRRT) and markers of kidney function, injury, and kidney morphological changes. Method(s): 14.8 MBq of <sup>203</sup>Pb-DOTATOC was administered to tumor-free CD1-Elite (SOPF) mice via tail vein and SPECT/CT images were obtained at 1.5 h and 22 h post-injection. After 1.5 weeks, the same group of mice (8 mice) was divided into 4 groups, and each group was injected with escalating activities of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC (0.037, 0.074, 0.118, and 0.178 MBq/g). The absorbed dose (alpha/beta) from <sup>212</sup>P b - DOTATOC was estimated by the OLINDA/EXM software based on the time-activity curves obtained from <sup>203</sup>Pb-DOTATOC SPECT/CT images. The renal mass of each mouse used in this calculation was obtained from the CT-delineated volume with an assumed density of 1.05 g/cm<sup>2</sup> . In order to assess acute and chronic kidney injury by the radiotherapeutic, blood or urine were collected at day 1, day 3, week 3, week 12, and 7 months post-injection for analysis of nephrotoxicity parameters NGal (Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and Cystatin C. Another group of four mice was injected with the highest dose (0.178 MBq/g), and hematological toxicity was evaluated by serial complete blood counts (up to 5 weeks). Result(s): Escalated activities of Pb-DOTATOC resulted in increased estimated alpha doses in kidneys (6.6 Gy to 35.2 Gy). Contributions of beta particles were minimal compared to the alpha particles accounting for less than 4% of the total absorbed dose. We found evidence for mild acute renal tubular toxicity based on measures of serum NGAL levels in 6 of the 8 treated mice, although the elevated levels appeared to show no relationship to the kidney doses in this study. There was no evidence of changes in renal function in this group when evaluated by continued normal levels of serum Cystatin C out to 12 weeks post administration of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC. We observed a 50% average decline in platelets and 40% average decline in WBC 2-3 weeks following administration of 0.178 MBq/g of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC in mice. These nadir values returned to baseline levels at 5 weeks post administration. Ongoing kidney histopathology studies will provide further information concerning the level of chronic renal toxicity of <sup>212</sup>PbDOTATOC using this dosing strategy. Conclusion(s): <sup>212</sup>Pb imagingbased dosimetry can be utilized for <sup>212</sup>Pb dose estimation and can inform personalized dosimetryguided therapy with Pbbased therapeutics. Administration of <sup>212</sup>PbDOTATOC (0.037 0.178 MBq/g) resulted in mild acute tubular toxicity and reversible hematological toxicity. NGal is a sensitive biomarker for acute renal tubular toxicity, but observed levels were not proportional to increased absorbed alpha doses in this study.",Excluded
1747,"The susceptibility of the retina to photochemical damage from visible light The photoreceptor/RPE complex must maintain a delicate balance between maximizing the absorption of photons for vision and retinal image quality while simultaneously minimizing the risk of photodamage when exposed to bright light. We review the recent discovery of two new effects of light exposure on the photoreceptor/RPE complex in the context of current thinking about the causes of retinal phototoxicity. These effects are autofluorescence photobleaching in which exposure to bright light reduces lipofuscin autofluorescence and, at higher light levels, RPE disruption in which the pattern of autofluorescence is permanently altered following light exposure. Both effects occur following exposure to visible light at irradiances that were previously thought to be safe. Photopigment, retinoids involved in the visual cycle, and bisretinoids in lipofuscin have been implicated as possible photosensitizers for photochemical damage. The mechanism of RPE disruption may follow either of these paths. On the other hand, autofluorescence photobleaching is likely an indicator of photooxidation of lipofuscin. The permanent changes inherent in RPE disruption might require modification of the light safety standards. AF photobleaching recovers after several hours although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet clear. Understanding the mechanisms of phototoxicity is all the more important given the potential for increased susceptibility in the presence of ocular diseases that affect either the visual cycle and/or lipofuscin accumulation. In addition, knowledge of photochemical mechanisms can improve our understanding of some disease processes that may be influenced by light exposure, such as some forms of Leber's congenital amaurosis, and aid in the development of new therapies. Such treatment prior to intentional light exposures, as in ophthalmic examinations or surgeries, could provide an effective preventative strategy.",Excluded

2059,"Radiosurgery for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas - Indications for limitations for gamma knife treatment. [Japanese] We summarize the results of gamma knife treatment for dural arterivenous fistula (DAVF), are report our study. Since the early 1990s, DAVFs have been treated in the same manner as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), i.e., by radiosurgery, performed with or without embolization. DAVFs in the cavernous sinus, transverse-sigmoid sinus, and cerebellar tent were treated with a marginal dose of 18 to 20 Gy. The current obliteration rates of DAVF reported in literature are not low when compared with those of AVM. Excellent DAVF obliteration rates were observed in our study, which were similar to those reported in the literature. In fact, complete response (CR) was observed in 9 cases, partial response (PR) in 9 cases, and partical obliteration in 6 cases during the mean follow-up of 27 months. Moreover, considerable neurological improvements were noted, which apparently began at an early stage post radiosurgery. Bleeding was observed 2 cases associated with cortical reflux during the follow-up. In conclusion, radiosurgery for DAVF is very useful for both the obliteration of the fistula and for the improvement of clinical signs. However, prior to performing radiosurgery, the lesions with cortical reflux should be interrupted by initially treated with surgery or embolization.",Excluded

[11C]verapamil (0.1 mg/kg) was administered and the changes in tissue concentrations were determined ex vivo by organ extirpation and in vivo with PET. To block P-gp function, cyclosporin A was administered. 3. Biodistribution studies revealed 9.5-fold (P < 0.001) and 3.4-fold (P < 0.001) higher [11C]verapamil in the brain and testes of mdr1a(-/-) mice than in mdr1a(+/+) mice. Cyclosporin A (25 mg/kg) increased [11C]verapamil levels in the brain and testes of mdr1a(+/+) mice in both cases 3.3-fold (P < 0.01 (brain); P < 0.001 (testes)). Fifty mg/kg cyclosporin A increased [11C]verapamil in the brain 10.6-fold (P < 0.01) and in the testes 4.1-fold (P < 0.001). No increases were found in the mdr1a(-/-) mice. This indicates complete inhibition of P-gp mediated [11C]verapamil efflux. 4. Positron camera data showed lower [11C]verapamil levels in the brain of mdr1a(+/+) mice compared to those in mdr1a(-/-) mice. [11C]verapamil accumulation in the brain of mdr1a(+/+) mice was increased by cyclosporin A to levels comparable with those in mdr1a(-/-) mice, indicating that reversal of P-gp mediated efflux can be monitored by PET. 5. We conclude that cyclosporin A can fully block the P-gp function in the blood brain barrier and the testes and that PET enables the in vivo measurement of P-gp function and reversal of its function non-invasively.",Excluded

Using microarrays, the patterns of gene expression were established for brain, kidney, liver and spleen samples from the non-exposed offspring of irradiated CBA/Ca and BALB/c male mice. The most over-represented categories among the genes differentially expressed in the offspring of control and irradiated males were those involved in rhythmic process, circadian rhythm and DNA-dependent regulation of transcription.

Irinotecan plus cisplatin significantly improved overall survival compared with etoposide plus cisplatin for extensive-stage SCLC. We compared these regimens for overall survival of patients with limited-stage SCLC. Method(s): We did this phase 3 study in 36 institutions in Japan. Eligibility criteria included age 20-70 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate organ functions. Eligible patients with previously untreated limited-stage SCLC received one cycle of etoposide plus cisplatin (intravenous etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-3; intravenous cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) plus AHTRT (1.5 Gy twice daily, 5 days a week, total 45 Gy over 3 weeks). Patients without progressive disease following induction therapy were randomised (1:1 ratio, using a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment balancing on ECOG performance status [0 vs 1], response to induction chemoradiotherapy [complete response plus near complete response vs partial response and stable disease], and institution) to receive either three further cycles of consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin or irinotecan plus cisplatin (intravenous irinotecan 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, 15; intravenous cisplatin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1). Patients, physicians, and investigators were aware of allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival after randomisation; primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00144989, and the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number C000000095. Finding(s): 281 patients were enrolled between Sept 1, 2002, and Oct 2, 2006. After induction etoposide plus cisplatin and AHTRT, 258 patients were randomised to consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin (n=129) or irinotecan plus cisplatin (n=129). In the etoposide plus cisplatin group, median overall survival was 3.2 years (95% CI 2.4-4.1). In the irinotecan and cisplatin group, median overall survival was 2.8 years (95% CI 2.4-3.6); overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.09 [95% CI 0.80-1.46], one-sided stratified log-rank p=0.70). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (120 [95%] in the etoposide plus cisplatin group vs 101 [78%] in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group), anaemia (44 [35%] vs 50 [39%]), thrombocytopenia (26 [21%] vs six [5%]), febrile neutropenia (21 [17%] vs 18 [14%]), and diarrhoea (two [2%] vs 13 [10%]). There was one treatment-related adverse event leading to death in each group (radiation pneumonitis in the etoposide plus cisplatin group; brain infarction in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group).

2160,"Stereotactic radiosurgery plus whole brain radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for patients with multiple brain metastases PURPOSE: Multiple brain metastases are a common health problem, frequently diagnosed in patients with cancer. The prognosis, even after treatment with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), is poor with average expected survivals less than 6 months. Retrospective series of stereotactic radiosurgery have shown local control and survival benefits in case series of patients with solitary brain metastases. We hypothesized that radiosurgery plus WBRT would provide improved local brain tumor control over WBRT alone in patients with two to four brain metastases.METHODS: Patients with two to four brain metastases (all < or =25 mm diameter and known primary tumor type) were randomized to initial brain tumor management with WBRT alone (30 Gy in 12 fractions) or WBRT plus radiosurgery. Extent of extracranial cancer, tumor diameters on MRI scan, and functional status were recorded before and after initial care.RESULTS: The study was stopped at an interim evaluation at 60% accrual. Twenty-seven patients were randomized (14 to WBRT alone and 13 to WBRT plus radiosurgery). The groups were well matched to age, sex, tumor type, number of tumors, and extent of extracranial disease. The rate of local failure at 1 year was 100% after WBRT alone but only 8% in patients who had boost radiosurgery. The median time to local failure was 6 months after WBRT alone (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.5) in comparison to 36 months (95% CI, 15.6-57) after WBRT plus radiosurgery (p = 0.0005). The median time to any brain failure was improved in the radiosurgery group (p = 0.002). Tumor control did not depend on histology (p = 0.85), number of initial brain metastases (p = 0.25), or extent of extracranial disease (p = 0.26). Patients who received WBRT alone lived a median of 7.5 months, while those who received WBRT plus radiosurgery lived 11 months (p = 0.22). Survival did not depend on histology or number of tumors, but was related to extent of extracranial disease (p = 0.02). There was no neurologic or systemic morbidity related to stereotactic radiosurgery.CONCLUSIONS: Combined WBRT and radiosurgery for patients with two to four brain metastases significantly improves control of brain disease. WBRT alone does not provide lasting and effective care for most patients.",Excluded

We also investigated the effectiveness of exercise classes as an intervention measure in this situation.METHODS: 1159 subjects (75.2 +/- 5.8 years, 57.5% female) were included at baseline, and followed-up for four years. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of incident functional disability according to the presence of risk factors evaluated by the municipality&rsquo;s self-assessment Basic Checklist (BCL). Evacuees from Iitate who participated in the exercise classes and those who did not were matched using the propensity scores, which were then used to obtain the HR of incident functional disability.RESULTS: New functional disability occurred in 280 (24.2%) participants during the follow-up. Participants who scored negative for the &ldquo;Physical function&rdquo; domain in the BCL had a HR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.54-2.69) for incident functional disability when compared to those who scored positive for this domain. Similarly, the HR for &ldquo;Cognitive function&rdquo; was 1.37 (CI: 1.06-1.77), and 1.60 (CI: 1.24-2.08) for &ldquo;Depression&rdquo;. Using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, both the group with low-participation in the exercise program and the group with high-participation in the exercise program had a significantly lower rate of incident functional disability compared to those who did not participate at all (HR = 0.27, CI: 0.16-0.46; HR = 0.30, CI: 0.12-0.74, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Pre-disaster BCL domains were useful to identify individuals at risk of functional disability after a major socio-technical disaster.

1909,"NF-kappa B signaling pathway as a target for human tumor radiosensitization NF-kappa B is a critical nuclear transcriptional factor that is activated in response to cellular stresses and regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and cell death. When regulated NF-kappa B activation is disrupted, cells undergo apoptosis. That is, constitutively elevated or dysregulated NF-kappa B activation leads to cell death in response to stress. These mechanisms have been shown experimentally by expressing dominant negative inhibitors of NF-kappa B (I kappa B-alpha) in cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutic agents or to ionizing radiation. NF-kappa B also plays an important role in a novel, radiation-inducible signaling pathway that involves the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase. Cells from patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation and exhibit impaired NF-kappa B activation in response to this stress. Restoration of NF-kappa B regulation in AT fibroblasts by introducing a dominant negative form of I kappa B-alpha has resulted in correction of radiation sensitivity and a reduction of ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. Expression of introduced ATM in AT cells results in correction of NF-kappa B regulation and an increase in postradiation survival without reduction in radiation-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these observations support a central role for NF-kappa B regulation in cellular intrinsic radiation sensitivity and apoptosis after exposure to ionizing radiation. Therefore, we hypothesize that the signaling pathway involving ATM/NF-kappa B/I kappa B offers attractive potential molecular targets for radiation sensitization in strategies to enhance the therapeutic ratio in cancer treatment.",Excluded

We show that PER expression restricted to the LN(v)s only restores the morning activity, whereas expression of PER in both the LN(v)s and LN(d)s also restores the evening activity. This provides the first neuronal bases for 'morning' and 'evening' oscillators in the Drosophila brain. Furthermore, we show that the LN(v)s alone can generate 24 h activity rhythms in constant darkness, indicating that the morning oscillator is sufficient to drive the circadian system.",Excluded
2151,"Nuclear and chromatin lipids: metabolism in normal and gamma-irradiated rats The data on nuclear and chromatin lipid metabolism are reviewed. The amount of neutral lipids and phospholipids in nuclei of rat thymus, liver and neocortex neuron as well as the amount of lipids in rat thymus and liver chromatin are described. The metabolic responses of nuclear and chromatin lipids from thymus to different doses and dose rates of gamma-irradiation of rats are discussed. In most cases, the nuclear and chromatin lipid responses are distinct. Changes in nuclear and chromatin lipid metabolism in response to gamma-irradiation are suggested to connect with the signal transduction pathway and the regulation of the transcriptional and replicative chromatin activity. The influence of beta-carotene and picrotoxin on rat liver nuclear lipids and neocortex neuronal nuclear lipids, respectively, was analyzed. The possible involvement of the lipid traffic in the chromatin lipid responses to gamma-irradiation and other agents is suggested. [References: 66]",Excluded
1647,"Counteraction by repetitive daily exposure to static magnetism against sustained blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels in cultured rat hippocampal neurons In rat hippocampal neurons cultured with the antagonist for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors dizocilpine (MK-801) for 8 days in vitro (DIV), a significant decrease was seen in the expression of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) as well as mRNA for both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), in addition to decreased viability. MK-801 not only decreased the expression of the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors but also increased NR2A expression, without affecting NR2B expression. Repetitive daily exposure to static magnetic fields at 100 mT for 15 min led to a decrease in the expression of MAP-2, without significantly affecting cell viability or the expression of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and GAP-43. However, the repetitive magnetism prevented decreases in both BDNF mRNA and MAP-2 and additionally increased the expression of NR2A subunit, without altering NR1 expression in neurons cultured in the presence of MK-801. Repetitive magnetism was also effective in preventing the decrease by MK-801 in the ability of NMDA to increase intracellular free Ca2+ ions, without affecting the decrease in the maximal response. These results suggest that repetitive magnetism may at least in part counteract the neurotoxicity of MK-801 through modulation of the expression of particular NMDA receptor subunits in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.",Excluded

The majority of the patients had suffered from hyposalivation and dry mouth for more than 8 years. The saliva substitute consisted of a water soluble extract of linseed. The physical properties of this extract are similar to those of the glycoproteins of the salivary secretions. The patients used the saliva substitute for a seven days period. Prior to the use of the extract the patients reported that the most severe symptoms of decreased salivation were a feeling of dryness in the mouth and burning sensations in the tongue, pharynx and oesophagus, The majority of the patients reported that the use of Salinum reduced the symptoms of hyposalivation. Great variation in effect occurred from patient to patient. Generally the patients with the most severe symptoms experienced the greatest relief of the symptoms when they used Salinum.

We reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent LINAC radiosurgery for brain metastasis at our institution during 2010-2012, and who had not previously undergone either surgery or whole brain radiotherapy. Data were analyzed for 55 brain metastases from 46 patients (24 males), mean age 59.9 years. During the 2 months following LINAC radiosurgery, the mean steroid dose decreased from 4.8 to 2.6 mg/day, the mean metastasis volume decreased from 3.79+/-4.12 cc to 2.8+/-4.48 cc (p=0.001), and the mean edema volume decreased from 16.91+/-30.15 cc to 12.85+/-24.47 cc (p=0.23). The 17 patients with reductions of more than 50% in brain edema volume had single metastases. Edema volume in the nine patients with two brain metastases remained stable in five patients (volume change <10%, 0-2 cc) and increased in four patients (by >10%, 2-14 cc). In a subanalysis of eight metastases with baseline edema volume greater than 40 cc, edema volume decreased from 77.27+/-37.21 cc to 24.84+/-35.6 cc (p=0.034). Reductions in brain edema were greater in metastases for which non-small-cell lung carcinoma and breast cancers were the primary diseases. Overall, symptoms improved in most patients. No patients who were without symptoms or who had no signs of increased intracranial pressure at baseline developed signs of intracranial pressure following LINAC radiosurgery. In this series, LINAC stereotactic radiosurgery for metastatic brain lesions resulted in early reduction in brain edema volume in single metastasis patients and those with large edema volumes, and reduced the need for steroids.",Excluded

1339,"Electrically evoked GABA release in rat hippocampus CA1 region and its changes during kindling epileptogenesis Previous findings on changes in K+-induced GABA release from hippocampal slices during kindling epileptogenesis were reinvestigated using physiological electrical stimulation. For that purpose, a procedure was developed enabling neurochemical monitoring of GABA release locally in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices upon tetanic stimulation of Schaffer-collateral fibers. In the presence of a GABA reuptake blocker, subsequent application of short (3 s) pulses of 50-Hz stimuli induced a local transient increase in GABA release. In slices from fully kindled animals, 24 h after the last generalized seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release was increased in comparison to control slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, 4-5 weeks after the last seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release had returned to control levels. Application of the broad low-affinity GABAB receptor antagonist saclofen increased the tetanically stimulated GABA release in control slices, but had no effect in fully kindled slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, however, saclofen enhanced GABA release similarly as in control slices. We conclude that the transient increase in tetanus-induced GABA release during kindling epileptogenesis is seizure-related, and probably caused by temporarily impaired presynaptic GABAB receptors. The possible relevance of this finding for GABA transmission in epilepsy is discussed.",Excluded

Nevertheless, tissue specificity of bystander responses within the same organism has not been examined in detail. Studies on in vivo bystander effect conducted so far analyzed changes induced by single-dose exposure. The potential of fractionated irradiation to induce bystander effects in vivo has never been studied. We analyzed changes in global DNA methylation and microRNAome in skin and spleen of animals subjected to single-dose (acute or fractionated) whole-body or cranial exposure to 0.5 Gy of X-rays. We found that IR-induced DNA methylation changes in bystander spleen and skin were distinct. Acute radiation exposure resulted in a significant loss of global DNA methylation in the exposed and bystander spleen 6 hr, 96 hr, and 14 days after irradiation. Fractionated irradiation led to hypomethylation in bystander spleen 6 hr after whole-body exposure, and 6 hr, 96 hr, and 14 days after cranial irradiation. Contrarily, changes in the skin of the same animals were seen only 6 hr after acute whole-body and head exposure. DNA hypomethylation observed in spleen was paralleled by a reduction of methyl-binding protein MeCP2 expression. Irradiation also induced tissue-specific microRNAome alterations in skin and spleen. For the first time, we have shown that IR-induced epigenetic bystander effects that occur in the same organism are triggered by both acute and fractionated exposure and are very distinct in different bystander organs. Future studies are clearly needed to address organismal and carcinogenic repercussions of those changes.",Included

These relationships are analyzed empirically as well as theoretically by developing a pressure-density relation based on a thermodynamic model and the Mie intermolecular potential. The results indicate that for many soft tissues, the coefficient of nonlinearity is largely determined by the isentropic compressibility, kappa<sub>s</sub>.

1536,"Perceptual centering of body segment orientation It has been shown experimentally that under certain combinations of sensory stimuli, human subjects can perceive one of several distinct illusions about their overall orientation in or movement through space. In at least some cases, the structure of such multistable illusory perceptions of orientation can be efficiently described by perceptual transformations that act on a current orientation estimate to yield an updated perceptual construct. Repeated application of identified generating transformations yields a limited set of predicted illusions for a given sensory environment. This approach is especially valuable for perceptual data that exhibits discretely differing classes of illusions between subjects or trials. In a previous study, application of a semigroup of perceptual centering transformations has succeeded in reproducing and simplifying data from an experiment in which subjects experiencing visual vection reported a range of illusions about the orientations of their gaze, head, and torso to gravity. After reviewing previously obtained results on perceptual centering, this article generalizes the approach, presenting the mathematics required to characterize perceptual transformations. The developed framework should be widely applicable in the understanding of perceptual illusions, particularly when these are guided by alignment with preferred constructs. Secondly, the article reveals the nontrivial mathematical process of perceptual semigroup formation and evaluation, deducing the complete description of the semigroup constructed in the previous study. Perceptual centering transformations identified in terrestrial experiments may predict illusions to be expected in spaceflight. For example, our results indicate that under certain conditions, many astronauts will misperceive a visual rotation axis to be centered in front of the head or even the torso.",Excluded
2175,"Orientation illusions in spaceflight Investigations of spontaneous illusory reactions were carried out during space-flights of various durations by ANKETA questionnaires (104 cosmonauts). From a total of 104 cosmonauts, 24, in addition, used a dictaphone to record a verbal description of the illusions and their sensations on tape. Analysis of data generated by ANKETA and the tapes thus recorded have shown that during adaptation to weightlessness, 98% of cosmonauts have noted the occurrence of various illusions of orientation (coordinate and kinetic): illusions pertaining to their position or illusions of self- and surround-motion. The development of spatial orientation illusions during and after flight is not limited to certain individuals, but is a general response of the sensory system to microgravity. These responses differ to some extent among individuals in severity, nature, time and duration of occurrence, and the dynamics of the process. Perceptual disorders may occur even if the cosmonaut feels well and experiences no anomalous autonomic reactions. The nature of spatial illusions was determined by the role and relative contribution of various types of sensory input to spatial orientation. After completion of the initial stage of adaptation to weightlessness, the perceptual disorders disappear. However, spontaneous illusory reactions were often observed after 50 days of exposure to weightlessness. The adaptation process during long-term spaceflight had an undulating course, in which adaptation and de-adaptation alternated. A classification of weightlessness illusions is proposed.",Excluded

1912,"Safety of 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a well-characterized hemoglobinopathy affecting more than 20 million individuals worldwide and carries an increased risk of cerebral vasculopathy, cerebral infarct, and stroke. As mechanisms of cerebral infarction in SCD are partly attributable to microvascular vaso-occlusive crises, manifesting as altered cerebral blood flow and associated impaired oxygen delivery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods that can quickly provide a comprehensive perspective on structural and functional disease status, without exogenous contrast administration or ionizing radiation, have emerged as crucial clinical tools for surveillance. However, early ex vivo MRI work in suspended erythrocytes containing hemoglobin S at 0.35 Tesla (T) suggested that sickled erythrocytes can orient preferentially in the presence of an external magnetic field, and as such, it was suggested that MRI exams in sickle cell hemoglobinopathy could induce vaso-occlusion. While this observation has generally not impacted clinical imaging in individuals with SCD, it has led to resistance for some sickle cell studies within the engineering community among some imaging scientists as this early observation has never been rigorously shown to be unconcerning. Here, we performed MRI at the clinical field strength of 3 T in 172 patients with SCD, which included standard anatomical and angiographic assessments together with gold standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; spatial resolution = 1.8 x 1.8 x 4 mm; b-value = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) for acute infarct assessment (performed approximately 20 min after patient introduction to the field isocenter).

A well-characterized, orthotopic rodent model of radiation-induced brain necrosis including a tumor is not currently available The objective of the study was to create focal radiation necrosis in rat brain bearing human glioblastoma (GBM) using stereotactic radiosurgery and confirm it by immuno-histological analysis. Nude rats implanted with primary GBM cells were irradiated using a stereotactic setup (n = 3) or received no radiation (n = 3). Ten weeks after the implantation, growth of the tumor was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Inclusion criteria were (1) significant cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficit, (2) no evidence of vessel occlusion on spCTA and (3) follow-up-confirmed acute ischemic infarction. waveletCTA was independently analysed by two readers regarding presence and location of vessel occlusions. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of waveletCTA-detected occlusions.RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall, an occlusion was identified using waveletCTA in 31 (52.5 %) patients with negative spCTA. Out of 47 patients with middle cerebral artery infarction, 27 occlusions (57.4 %) were detected by waveletCTA, mainly located in the M2 (15) and M3 segments (8).

This report provides safety information from preclinical toxicology studies and first-in-human whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry studies of [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 for its potential application in human brain imaging studies.PROCEDURES: MK-6240 was administered intravenously (IV) in a 7-day rat toxicity study at x 50, x 100, and x 1000 dose margins relative to projected highest clinical dose of 0.333 mug/kg. The IV formulation of MK-6240 for clinical use and the formulation used in the 7-day rat toxicity study was tested for hemolysis potential in human and Wistar rat whole blood. Sequential whole-body positron emission tomography scans were performed in three healthy young subjects after IV bolus injection of 180 +/- 0.3 MBq [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 to characterize organ biodistribution and estimate whole-body radiation exposure (effective dose).RESULTS: MK-6240 administered IV in a 7-day rat toxicity study did not show any test article-related changes.

1792,"A new UV-sensitive mutant that suggests a second excision repair pathway in Neurospora crassa In an attempt to understand the relationship between photorepair and dark repair in Neurospora crassa, a new mutant was isolated, which showed defects in both repair processes. The new mutant, mus-38, is moderately sensitive to UV and shows imperfect photoreactivation following UV irradiation. DNA was purified from this mutant and the other UV-sensitive mutants, and analyzed for the removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). UV-specific endonuclease-sensitive sites (ESS) completely disappeared with 1 h of photoreactivation in mus-38 DNA, although the survival recovery with photoreactivation was greatly reduced in this mutant. This suggests that the insufficient survival recovery with photoreactivation in mus-38 does not result from a failure of photo-reversal of CPDs. Removal of ESS during liquid holding (dark repair) was slower in mus-38 compared to wild type. To test the possibility that this mutant was involved in excision repair, the double mutant was made between mus-38 and mus-18, which encodes a UV-damage-specific endonuclease. CPD excision in the mus-18 null mutant was severely affected but not completely inhibited. The double mutant showed a complete loss of the excision activity and was super sensitive to UV. These results indicate that mus-38 participates in an excision pathway that is different from the mus-18 pathway. The mus-38 mutant was sensitive not only to UV but also to some chemical mutagens which make adducts on DNA. Thus, mus-38 is possibly involved in an excision-repair pathway that is related to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 pathway. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded

1200,"Interaction between tissue oxygen tension and NADH imaging during synaptic stimulation and hypoxia in rat hippocampal slices Oxygen and NADH are essential components in the production of ATP in the CNS. This study examined the dynamic interaction between tissue oxygen tension (pO(2)) and NADH imaging changes within hippocampal tissue slices, during metabolic stresses including hypoxia and synaptic activation. The initiation of abrupt hypoxia (from 95% O(2) to 95% N(2)) caused a rapid decrease in pO(2), onset of hypoxic spreading depression (hsd; at 6.7+/-1.3 mm Hg; n=15), and a monophasic increase in NADH. Provided that reoxygenation was prompt, synaptic responses, pO(2) and NADH levels returned to baseline following hsd. Longer hypoxia caused irreversible neuronal dysfunction, an increase in pO(2) beyond baseline (due to decreased tissue demand), and hyperoxidation of NADH (10+/-2% decrease below baseline; n=7). Synaptic activation in ambient 95% O(2) caused a decrease or 'initial dip' in pO(2) and a biphasic NADH response (oxidation followed by reduction). The oxidizing phase of the NADH response was mitochondrial as it was synchronous with the 'initial' dip in pO(2). Following slow graded reductions in ambient oxygen levels to 8%, four of seven slices developed hsd following synaptic stimulation. The hypoxic threshold for graded oxygen reductions occurred at 7.9+/-5.8 mm Hg O(2) (n=7). Our hypoxic threshold range (6.7-7.9 mm Hg O(2) from abrupt and graded oxygen reduction, respectively) correlates well with reported in vivo values of <12 mm Hg O(2). The major findings of this study include: 1) determination of the critical physiological threshold of pO(2) (based upon hsd), which is a marker of imminent neuronal death if oxygen is not rapidly restored; 2) NADH hyperoxidation and an increase in pO(2) beyond baseline levels following longer periods of hypoxia; and 3) the occurrence of a pO(2) 'dip' during synaptic stimulation, which correlates with the early oxidizing phase of the biphasic NADH response.",Excluded

There is little information on the fate and potential therapeutic efficacy of the reinfusion of MSCs following total body irradiation (TBI). We addressed this question using human MSC (hMSCs) infused to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to TBI. Further, we tested the impact of additional local irradiation (ALI) superimposed to TBI, as a model of accidental irradiation. NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with hMSCs. Group 1 was not irradiated before receiving hMSC infusion. Group 2 received only TBI at a dose of 3.5 Gy, group 3 received local irradiation to the abdomen at a dose of 4.5 Gy in addition to TBI, and group 4 received local irradiation to the leg at 26.5 Gy in addition to TBI. Fifteen days after irradiation, quantitative and spatial distribution of the hMSCs were studied. Histological analysis of mouse tissues confirmed the presence of radio-induced lesions in the irradiated fields. Following their infusion into nonirradiated animals, hMSCs homed at a very low level to various tissues (lung, bone marrow, and muscles) and no significant engraftment was found in other organs. TBI induced an increase of engraftment levels of hMSCs in the brain, heart, bone marrow, and muscles. Abdominal irradiation (AI) as compared with leg irradiation (LI) increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (the gut, liver, and spleen). Hind LI as compared with AI increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (skin, quadriceps, and muscles). An increase of hMSC engraftment in organs outside the fields of the ALI was also observed. Conversely, following LI, hMSC engraftment was increased in the brain as compared with AI. This study shows that engraftment of hMSCs in NOD/SCID mice with significantly increased in response to tissue injuries following TBI with or without ALI. ALI induced an increase of the level of engraftment at sites outside the local irradiation field, thus suggesting a distant (abscopal) effect of radiation damage.

2108,"Biomedical applications of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy EPR spectroscopy is the most straightforward-to-use technique for studying free radicals and other paramagnetic species and has therefore established itself in biomedical research and for clinical applications. EPR found its applications in oximetry, where this technique allows repeated measurements of oxygen in tissues-also in vivo and in combination with imaging techniques. The direct detection of paramagnetic species like transition metal ions by EPR allows elucidation of their specific roles in disease, for example how copper ions might be involved in the formation of amyloid- or amyloid-like fibrils in neurodegenerative diseases. For investigations on the structures of this protein aggregates, but also of other proteins or protein complexes with medical relevance the technique of site-directed spin labeling (SDSL)-the site-specific introduction of paramagnetic reporter groups into proteins or nucleic acids-is nowadays frequently used, especially in cases where other structural techniques are not applicable. Moreover, by direct detection of free radicals-also in combination with spin trapping methods, or application of SDSL, EPR spectroscopy can be also used for diagnostic purposes, e.g. in cancer diagnostics.

1535,"Assessment of renal function after conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy by functional 1H-MRI and 23Na-MRI PURPOSE: Adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCHT) improves survival of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. Conventional three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to a significant amount of the left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) provides excellent target coverage with improved kidney sparing. Few long-term results on IMRT for gastric cancer, however, have been published. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3.0 T including blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and, for the first time, (23)Na imaging was used to evaluate renal status after radiotherapy with 3D-CRT or IG-IMRT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four disease-free patients (2 after 3D-CRT and 2 after IMRT; FU for all patients > 5 years) were included in this feasibility study. Morphological sequences, axial DWI images, 2D-gradient echo (GRE)-BOLD images, and (23)Na images were acquired. Mean values/standard deviations for ((23)Na), the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and R2* values were calculated for the upper/middle/lower parts of both kidneys. Corticomedullary (23)Na-concentration gradients were determined.RESULTS: Surprisingly, IG-IMRT patients showed no morphological alterations and no statistically significant differences of ADC and R2* values in all renal parts. Values for mean corticomedullary (23)Na-concentration matched those for healthy volunteers. Results were similar in 3D-CRT patients, except for the cranial part of the left kidney. This was atrophic and presented significantly reduced functional parameters (p = 0.001-p = 0.033). Reduced ADC values indicated reduced cell density and reduced extracellular space. Cortical and medullary R2* values of the left cranial kidney in the 3D-CRT group were higher, indicating more deoxygenated hemoglobin due to reduced blood flow/oxygenation. ((23)Na) of the renal cranial parts in the 3D-CRT group was significantly reduced, while the expected corticomedullary (23)Na-concentration gradient was partially conserved.CONCLUSIONS: Functional MRI can assess postradiotherapeutic renal changes. As expected, marked morphological/functional effects were observed in high-dose areas (3D-CRT), while, unexpectedly, no alteration in kidney function was observed in IG-IMRT patients, supporting the hypothesis that reducing total/fractional dose to the renal parenchyma by IMRT is clinically beneficial.",Excluded

1627,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for renal cell carcinoma brain metastases Object. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) in achieving a partial or complete remission of so-called radioresistant metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and to propose guidelines for optimal treatment Methods. During a 5-year period, 29 patients (19 male and 10 female) with 92 brain metastases from RCC underwent GKS. The median tumor volume was 4.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 0.5-14.5 cm<sup>3</sup>). Fourteen patients (48%) also underwent whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) before GKS, and two patients (6.8%) after GKS. The mean GKS dose delivered to the 50% isodose at the tumor margin was 16.8 Gy (range 13-30 Gy). All cases were categorized according to the Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification for brain metastases. Univariate analysis was performed to determine significant prognostic factors and survival. The overall median survival was 7 months after GKS treatment. Age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and controlled primary disease were not predictors of survival. Combined WBRT/GKS resulted in median survival of 18, 8.5, and 5.3 months for RPA Classes I, II, and III, respectively, compared with the median survival 7.1, 4.2, and 2.3 months for patients treated with WBRT alone. Conclusions. These results suggest that WBRT combined with GKS may improve survival in patients with brain metastases from RCC. Furthermore, this improvement in survival was seen in all RPA classes.",Excluded
1786,"A case of paraplegia with piriformis syndrome. [Turkish, English] Apart from being a neuropathy developed by the compression and irritation of piriformis muscle on the sciatic nerve, piriformis syndrome (PS) can also be caused by a trigger point without sciatic nerve involvement. Although it has been reported that PS could be seen in individuals at all activity levels, PS in patients who had spinal cord injury (SCI) has not been reported. In this study, a case of paraplegia, suffering from hip pain, who had been diagnosed and treated as PS was presented. A 62 years old woman complaining about pain and numbness in low back and right hip was admitted to our clinic. She was mobilized by crutches. From her anamnesis it was understood that she developed paraplegia after a fall two years ago. In her physical examination, she was diagnosed as ASIA: D T3 incomplete paraplegia. Her complaints had started 6 months ago after falling on her right hip. She had a severe pain with radicular radiation, during the deep palpation of the piriformis muscle. Compression of lumbar spinous processes were slightly painful. While FAIR, Pace, Beatty tests were positive on the right side, straight leg raising and the Laseque tests were both negative. For the purpose of diagnosis and treatment, 4 cc of 2% lidocaine+1 cc of betametazon dipropionate injection with a 22 G 88 mm Spinocan was done under the guidance of ultrasound into the piriformis muscle. The patient was diagnosed as PS as there was a significant relief of symptoms after the injection. When the risk factors that can cause PS were questioned, we learned that she had a habit of eating on the floor and sitting with her legs crossed. The patient's activities of daily living were organized and medical treatment, lumbosacral orthosis and piriformis stretching exercises were given. It was observed that her complaints diminished gradually in 1st. and 3rd. months controls. In conclusion, while neuropathic pain below the level of neurologic injury often suggest central pain in patients with SCI, PS is a must to be considered in the differential diagnosis of hip pain especially in patients with incomplete SCI.",Excluded

Vision in deep-sea crustaceans Using new collecting techniques with the Johnson-Sea-Link submersible, eight species of deep-sea benthic crustaceans were collected with intact visual systems. Their spectral sensitivities and temporal resolutions were determined shipboard using electroretinography. Useable spectral sensitivity data were obtained from seven species, and in the dark-adapted eyes, the spectral sensitivity peaks were in the blue region of the visible spectrum, ranging from 470 to 497 nm. Under blue chromatic adaptation, a secondary sensitivity peak in the UV portion of the spectrum appeared for two species of anomuran crabs: Eumunida picta (lambda(max)363 nm) and Gastroptychus spinifer (lambda(max)383 nm). Wavelength-specific differences in response waveforms under blue chromatic adaptation in these two species suggest that two populations of photoreceptor cells are present. Temporal resolution was determined in all eight species using the maximum critical flicker frequency (CFF(max)). The CFF(max) for the isopod Booralana tricarinata of 4 Hz proved to be the lowest ever measured using this technique, and suggests that this species is not able to track even slow-moving prey. Both the putative dual visual pigment system in the crabs and the extremely slow eye of the isopod may be adaptations for seeing bioluminescence in the benthic environment.",Excluded

1589,"Quantifying the impact of antiangiogenic therapy on hypoxia and implications for radiation therapy in glioblastoma multiforme with a biomathematical model Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor. As angiogenesis is a major hallmark of GBM, it can be inferred that hypoxia plays a prominent role in the progression of the disease. However, due to difficulty in assessing hypoxia, the development and evolution of hypoxia has not been well studied for GBM. 18F-Fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET indirectly measures hypoxia. It is known that hypoxia reduces the efficacy of radiation therapy, and one current strategy being explored is to combine anti-angiogenic therapy and radiation therapy. However, it is unclear whether anti-angiogenic therapy is ultimately reducing or increasing hypoxia nor is it clear how long the effects last. Method(s): We have developed a spatio-temporal biomathematical model for glioma proliferation and invasion that incorporates the angiogenic cascade. In this context, we can simulate the action of anti-angiogenic treatment, such as bevacizumab, by modifying the availability of angiogenic factors. By applying a pharmacokinetic model for the uptake of FMISO to the simulation results, we can generate the corresponding FMISO-PET images during and after anti-angiogenic therapy to compare with what would be seen in the clinic. Result(s): Simulation results for a wide range of tumor kinetics demonstrated that hypoxia in general decreased during anti-angiogenic therapy. However, the rates at which it decreased and the time for the hypoxia to return to pre-treatment levels were not uniform. Conclusion(s): Dynamic understanding of anti-angiogenic therapy effects on vascular normalization and hypoxia suggest that optimal timing of radiation therapy and anti-angiogenic therapies would vary by patient. This biomathematical model can be tuned to individual patients' tumors and provide similar information as a FMISO-PET image and also give insight into the dynamics of the hypoxia over time. Such insight could be invaluable to patient-specific treatment planning for combining radiation with antiangiogenics.",Excluded

In addition, insertion of distal interlocking screws can be technically demanding and may entail substantial exposure. We present the results with an expandable self-locking nail in the management of 52 AO type A and B tibial shaft fractures. The mean time to union was 15.8 weeks and the rate of union was 98%. The average surgical time was 60 minutes. Complications were those usually seen in diaphysis nailing and no complication was noted during nail expansion. Interlocking screws are not necessary, which reduces the risk of iatrogenic lesions. The expandable nail allows effective management of AO type A and B diaphyseal fractures of the tibia, a lower radiation exposure and shorter operative time.",Excluded
1994,"A case of lung adenocarcinoma of the lung with disappearance of brain metastasis by re-treatment with gefitinib. [Japanese] BACKGROUND: Tumor response rate to gefitinib by previously treated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer was approximately 20%. However, there are few reports about effect of re-treatment with gefitinib. CASE: A 40-year-old man was given a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of lung (c-T2N3M1). Response was not obtained with chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin, vinorelbine + gencitabin). He developed brain metastasis and received whole brain radiation therapy. He was then given gefitinib. Reduction of the primary tumor, brain metastasis, pulmonary metastasis and liver metastasis was seen. Recurrence of pulmonary metastasis and liver metastasis was discovered 8 months after treatment with gefitinib. Therefore, treatment by gefitinib was stopped. Response was not achieved with chemotherapy (docetaxel and amrubicin). At the request of the patient, retreatment with gefitinib was resumed. Disappearance of brain metastasis was achieved. However, primary tumor, pulmonary metastasis and liver metastasis progressed. CONCLUSION(S): We reported a case whose brain metastases disappeared with re-treatment with gefitinib. This report is thought to be useful in terms of information about the acquired resistance of gefitinib.

1822,"Equivalent outcomes with hypofractionated, accelerated thoracic radiation therapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Does this represent a reasonable strategy in patients unable to attend twice daily treatment? Purpose/Objective(s): The publication of RTOG 8815 established hyperfractionated, twice-daily thoracic radiation therapy (BID RT) with concurrent platinum-etoposide (PE) as the standard of care in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). However, many patients with this aggressive, often debilitating malignancy find BID RT intolerable due to both physical and logistical limitations. As an alternative, patients unable to receive BID RT are treated with daily 3Gy fractions (QD RT) to a total dose of 45Gy at our institution.We hypothesized that hypofractionated QD RT in the setting of concurrent PE would be as safe and effective as BID RT. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with LS-SCLC treated with curative intent. Patients received 45Gy either QD (3Gy) or BID (1.5Gy) with concurrent PE. Covariables reviewed include age, gender, race, insurance status, year of diagnosis, 3D vs IMRT planning, PTV volume, chemotherapy agents and cycles, RT dose and fractionation, incidence of Grade >=2 radiation pneumonitis and subsequent delivery of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were utilized to compare the characteristics of treatment groups for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) estimates were generated, with accompanying univariate (UVA) log-rank and multivariate (MVA) Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Result(s): Thirty-six patients were evaluable, with a median follow-up of 13 months for the entire cohort (range 3-79), and a median follow-up of 18.5 months for survivors (range 7-73). 88% of patients were deceased at last follow-up. For the entire cohort, median age was 63 years (range 54-81). 24 (67%) patients received BID RT; 12 (33%) received QD RT. BID and QD groups were balanced with respect to age, race, sex, insurance status, PTV volume, and 3D vs IMRT planning. One patient in each group was treated with corticosteroids for radiation pneumonitis. No significant differences were observed for PFS or OS outcomes. 2-year PFS was 13.4% (BID) vs 16.7% (QD) (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-1.67; p<.61) and 2-year OS was 34.5% (BID) vs 31.7% (QD) (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.28-1.86; p<.51). Neither the incidence of Grade >= 2 radiation pneumonitis (p=0.61) nor utilization of PCI (BID 58% vs 50% QD, p=0.64) differed between the two groups. Conclusion(s): In this single-institution study, hypofractionated QD RT to 45Gy delivered with concurrent PE was associated with toxicity and outcomes comparable to BID RT with concurrent PE. Further validation with a larger, prospective dataset is warranted. Daily hypofractionated thoracic RT with concurrent chemotherapy represents a reasonable alternative for patients who cannot be treated twice daily.",Excluded
1899,"Central infusion of the melanocortin receptor antagonist agouti-related peptide (AgRP(83-132)) prevents cachexia-related symptoms induced by radiation and colon-26 tumors in mice Cachexia is a clinical wasting syndrome that occurs in multiple disease states, and is associated with anorexia and a progressive loss of body fat and lean mass. The development of new therapeutics for this disorder is needed due to poor efficacy and multiple side effects of current therapies. The pivotal role played by the central melanocortin system in regulating body weight has made this an attractive target for novel cachexia therapies. The mixed melanocortin receptor antagonist AgRP is an endogenous peptide that induces hyperphagia. Here, we used AgRP(83-132) to investigate the ability of melanocortin antagonism to protect against clinical features of cachexia in two distinct animal models. In an acute model, food intake and body weight gain were reduced in mice exposed to radiation (300 RAD), and delivery of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral cerebral ventricle prevented these effects. In a chronic tumor cachexia model, adult mice were injected subcutaneously with a cell line derived from murine colon-26 adenocarcinoma. Typical of cachexia, tumor-bearing mice progressively reduced body weight and food intake, and gained significantly less muscle mass than controls. Administration of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral ventricles significantly increased body weight and food intake, and changes in muscle mass were similar to the tumor-free control mice. These findings support the idea that antagonism of the central melanocortin system can reduce the negative impact of cachexia and radiation therapy. Â© 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1949,"Evaluation of a new foetal shielding device for pregnant brain tumour patients Background: The present study aimed to propose a new foetal shielding device for pregnant cancer patients to reduce the foetal dose associated with treatment techniques using multiple gantry angles, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Method(s): Three shielding structures were designed to minimise the scattered and leaked radiation from various gantry angles and radiation scattering within the patient. The base-plate part that can be placed on the treatment couch was designed to reduce the scattered and leaked radiation generated at gantry angles located near 180degree. A body shielding part that can cover the lower chest and abdomen was designed, and a neck-shielding structure was added to reduce the internal and external radiation scattering from the treatment area. Evaluation plans were generated to assess the foetal dose reduction by the foetal shielding device in terms of the shielding material thickness, distance from the field edge, and shielding component using the flattened 6 MV photon beam (6MV) and flattening filter-free 6 MV photon beam (6MV-FFF). In addition, the effectiveness of the foetal shielding device was evaluated in a pregnant brain tumour patient. Result(s): The shielding material consisting of three parts was placed on frames composed of four arch shapes with a vertical curved structure, connection bar at the top position, and base plate. Each shielding part resulted in reductions in the radiation dose according to the treatment technique, as the thickness of the shielding material increased and the foetal dose decreased. In addition, a foetal dose reduction of approximately 50% was confirmed at 50 cm from the field edge by using the designed shielding device in most delivery techniques. In patients, the newly designed shielding structures can effectively eliminate up to about 49% of the foetal dose generated from various gantry angles used in VMAT or IMRT. Conclusion(s): We designed a foetal shielding device consisting of three parts to effectively reduce the dose delivered to the foetus, and evaluated the device with various treatment techniques for a pregnant patient with brain tumour. The foetal shielding device shielded the scattered/leaked radiation from the treatment machine, and also effectively reduced internal scattering from the treatment area in the patient.

UVB (solar simulator-SIM) in environmental doses, during five consecutive days of exposure, in the brain and eyestalk of the crab Ucides cordatus. We evaluated these regions by sampling on the 1st, 3rd and 5th days of UV exposure for lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidant capacity against the peroxyl radical (ACAP), and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione-. S-transferase (GST). Immunohistochemical and immunoblotting assays were performed for anti-activated-caspase 3 in the brains. After the first day of exposure, LPO increased in the eyestalks and brains of the UV-exposed animals; ACAP, and CAT, GPX and GST activities also increased in the brains. On the third day, the LPO values in the eyestalk remained high in the UV-exposed groups, while ACAP decreased in the brain and eyestalk and CAT activity remained high in all irradiated groups in both regions. On the fifth day, LPO decreased in the eyestalk and brain of the UV-exposed groups. These results may have been a consequence of the antioxidant defense system (ADS) activity, since CAT activity was high in both regions, ACAP was high in the eyestalks of the SIM group, and GPX activity remained high in the eyestalks of the UVA and UVB groups. Immunohistochemical assays and immunoblotting showed that there was apoptosis in the brains of the UV-exposed crabs.

1721,"Structure of (5'S)-8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine in DNA Diastereomeric 8,5'-cyclopurine 2'-deoxynucleosides, containing a covalent bond between the deoxyribose and the purine base, represent an important class of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. The 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine lesion (cdG) has been recently reported to be a strong block of replication and highly mutagenic in Escherichia coli. The 8,5'-cyclopurine-2'-deoxyriboses are suspected to play a role in the etiology of neurodegeneration in xeroderma pigmentosum patients. These lesions cannot be repaired by base excision repair, but they are substrates for nucleotide excision repair. The structure of an oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing a site-specific S-cdG lesion placed opposite dC in the complementary strand was obtained by molecular dynamics calculations restrained by distance and dihedral angle restraints obtained from NMR spectroscopy. The S-cdG deoxyribose exhibited the O4'-exo (west) pseudorotation. Significant perturbations were observed for the beta, gamma, and chi torsion angles of the S-cdG nucleoside. Watson-Crick base pairing was conserved at the S-cdG.dC pair. However, the O4'-exo pseudorotation of the S-cdG deoxyribose perturbed the helical twist and base pair stacking at the lesion site and the 5'-neighbor dC.dG base pair. Thermodynamic destabilization of the duplex measured by UV melting experiments correlated with base stacking and structural perturbations involving the modified S-cdG.dC and 3'- neighbor dT.dA base pairs. These perturbations may be responsible for both the genotoxicity of this lesion and its ability to be recognized by nucleotide excision repair.",Excluded
1470,"Pulsed reduced dose rate re-irradiation (PRDR) using modulated arc (MARC) IMRT for recurrent gliomas: Initial clinical outcomes of a novel technique Introduction: Limited salvage options exist for patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors after standard treatment. Pulsed reduced dose rate re-irradiation (PRDR) is a biologically-unique strategy that lowers the effective dose rate, potentially decreasing toxicity by allowing for greater sublethal damage repair in normal tissue. It has been shown to be safe and effective in patients with recurrent gliomas using a 3DRT technique. We developed a novel technique using PRDR with modulated arc (mARC) IMRT delivery to further reduce the amount of normal tissue exposed. We report our initial clinical results using mARC PRDR in patients with previously-irradiated recurrent gliomas. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all brain tumor patients treated with mARC PRDR at our Institution. All mARC PRDR plans were generated with Monaco (Elekta Inc) using 1/10 of the total prescription dose. For each treatment fraction a total of 10 identical treatment beams were delivered with a minimum time interval of 3 min between beam initiations. This technique allows for the entire treatment volume to receive exactly 1/10 of the prescription dose every 3 min while limiting the prescription dose rate to less than 0.0667 Gy/min. Result(s): A total of 34 patients were treated with mARC PRDR. Primary histology included grade 2 (nZ6), grade 3 (nZ10), and grade 4 (nZ15) gliomas. Median dose at initial RT was 60 Gy (range 48 e 70) at 1.8 e 2 Gy per fraction. Patients were heavily pre-treated with a mean of 3 prior recurrences (range 1 e 7) before PRDR. Nineteen patients had repeat resection at recurrence including 6 just prior to PRDR. Bevacizumab was previously given to 16 patients with 26 patients receiving bevacizumab while undergoing PRDR (dose 10 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg q2 weeks). All patients had a KPS of 70 or greater. Mean age at PRDR was 53 (range 3 e 71). Median interval between initial RT and PRDR was 4.75 years (range 0.5 e 18.3). Median total dose was 54 Gy (range 30 e 60) at 2 Gy per fraction. At a mean follow-up of 9.3 months (range 0.5 - 19.3), 6-month OS was 70.5% and 1-year was OS 23.5%. Median time to progression was 6 months with 6-month PFS 47% and 1-year PFS 17.6%. Five of the 34 patients did not finish treatment due to clinical decline and/or tumor progression. No acute G3 toxicities were seen from PRDR. Conclusion(s): This is the first clinical report of mARC IMRT PRDR for recurrent gliomas. This technique appears to be safe, feasible, and welltolerated for previously-irradiated patients with recurrent gliomas.

The objectives of the present study were to explore the clinical characteristics and potential prognostic factors in CRC patients with BM. Between April 1991 and December 2010, all CRC patients treated in the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed and 60 patients were identified to have BM (36 males and 24 females). The association between patients and their tumor characteristics, treatment modality, and survival were statistically analyzed. The median age at diagnosis of BM was 62.5 years. Fifty-three patients (88.3%) developed extracranial metastases at diagnosis of BM. The cause of death was systemic disease in 19 patients and neurological disease in 23 patients. Brain metastases were primarily treated with either whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT; 15 patients), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; nine patients), or surgical resection (seven patients). Ten patients received WBRT and SRS, and 19 patients (31.7%) were treated with steroids alone. The median survival after diagnosis of BM was 8 months (95% confidence interval = 4.2-11.8 months). Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, the number of brain lesions, and treatment modality type were significantly associated with survival. Although BM from CRC is a late-stage phenomenon with an extremely poor prognosis, some subsets of patients would benefit from a multidisciplinary management strategy.

1654,"Clinical approach and surgical strategy for spinal disorders in pregnant women Introduction: Spinal diseases that require urgent surgical treatment are rare during pregnancy. There are many important diagnostic and therapeutic aspects that must be taken into account in such situations, especially if there is an acute indication for surgery. The data is available only in the form of case reports. Method(s): The study included consecutive pregnant patients who underwent spinal surgery at five neurosurgical high-volume centers between 2010 and 2017. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical data were derived from medical records. Result(s): Overall, 23 pregnant patients were assigned to acute spinal surgery. Two of them underwent preoperative cesarian section in the 34th and 32th week. The other 21 patients underwent surgery during pregnancy. Three patients were operated upon twice or more during the same pregnancy. The median age was 33 years (min 22, max 41 years). The median gestational age was 13 completed weeks (min 7, max 34 weeks). The indications were: n = 14 lumbar herniated intervertebral discs presenting with cauda equina syndrome in 4 cases, high graded motor deficit in 7 cases, and acute pain in 3 cases; n = 4 unstable spine injuries; n = 1 intramedullary tumor with paraparesis; n = 1 paraspinal infection; n = 1 swann cell nerve root tumor presenting with higher graded paresis. Perioperative pregnancy monitoring was done with an ultrasound or ultrasound plus CTG after the 24th week of gestation in the majority of cases. All surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia (balanced anaesthesia n = 12, total intravenous anaesthesia n = 9). Median duration of surgery was 90 min (min 41, max 240). 15 patients were placed in a prone position and 6 in a right or left lateral decubitus position depending on the gestational age and the type of surgery. In 9 cases no intraoperative fluoroscopy was done, in 12 cases fluoroscopic verficiation of spine level or guidance of instrumentation placement was performed with a median fluoroscopic time of 6 s (min 1, max 24 s). No postoperative neurosurgical complications occured. Two patients underwent medical abortion due to radiation exposure before the pregnancy was diagnosed. Among the other 19 patients, 2 suffered transient gestational diabetes, and one patient presented with vaginal bleeding without any signs for fetal complications. According to our current follow-up data, no miscarriages, stillbirths or other severe obstetric complications occured during the further courses of pregnancy. All patients improved neurologically after the surgery. Conclusion(s): Spinal surgical procedures during pregnancy seem to be generally safe. Nevertheless, the indication for surgery has to be very strict and surgical procedures during pregnany should be reserved for emergency cases with acute or threatening neurological deficit. For pregnant patients the surgical strategy should be individually tailored for the mother and the fetus.",Excluded
1243,"Comparative study of standing wave reduction methods using random modulation for transcranial ultrasonication Various transcranial sonotherapeutic technologies have risks related to standing waves in the skull. In this study, we present a comparative study on standing waves using four different activation methods: sinusoidal (SIN), frequency modulation by noise (FMN), periodic selection of random frequency (PSRF), and random switching of both inverse carriers (RSBIC). The standing wave was produced and monitored by the schlieren method using a flat plane and a human skull. The minimum ratio RSW, which is defined by the ratio of the mean of the difference between local maximal value and local minimal value of amplitude to the average value of the amplitude, was 36% for SIN, 24% for FMN, 13% for PSRF, and 4%for RSBIC for the flat reflective plate, and it was 25% for SIN, 11% for FMN, 13% for PSRF, and 5% for RSBIC for the inner surface of the human skull.

1509,"Development of a method for measuring femoral torsion using real-time ultrasound Excessive femoral torsion has been associated with various musculoskeletal and neurological problems. To explore this relationship, it is essential to be able to measure femoral torsion in the clinic accurately. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are thought to provide the most accurate measurements but CT involves significant radiation exposure and MRI is expensive. The aim of this study was to design a method for measuring femoral torsion in the clinic, and to determine the reliability of this method. Details of design process, including construction of a jig, the protocol developed and the reliability of the method are presented. The protocol developed used ultrasound to image a ridge on the greater trochanter, and a customized jig placed on the femoral condyles as reference points. An inclinometer attached to the customized jig allowed quantification of the degree of femoral torsion. Measurements taken with this protocol had excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability (ICC2,1 = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively). This method of measuring femoral torsion also permitted measurement of femoral torsion with a high degree of accuracy. This method is applicable to the research setting and, with minor adjustments, will be applicable to the clinical setting.",Excluded
1646,"Transcranial optogenetic stimulation for functional mapping of the motor cortex We developed a method that uses Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) for transcranial optogenetic stimulation. This method is based on scanning a light beam over the brain, thereby photostimulating ChR2-expressing neurons in intact mice. As a proof of principle, we applied this technique to the motor cortex of transgenic mice expressing ChR2 in cortical pyramidal cells. Photostimulation induced limb movements that were time-locked with millisecond precision and could be induced at frequencies up to 20 Hz. By scanning this light beam, we could map the distribution of neurons associated with limb movement. With this approach we could simultaneously define motor maps controlling two limbs and could reproducibly generate such cortical motor maps over periods of weeks. This method allows non-invasive mapping of brain circuitry in living animals and could help define the connection between behavior and brain circuitry.",Excluded
1332,"Characterization of skin reactions and pain reported by patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer at different sites BACKGROUND: Skin reactions and pain are commonly reported side effects of radiation therapy (RT).OBJECTIVE: To characterize RT-induced symptoms according to treatment site subgroups and identify skin symptoms that correlate with pain.METHODS: A self-report survey-adapted from the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and the McGill Pain Questionnaire--assessed RT-induced skin problems, pain, and specific skin symptoms. Wilcoxon Sign Ranked tests compared mean severity or pre- and post-RT pain and skin problems within each RT-site subgroup. Multiple linear regression (MLR) investigated associations between skin symptoms and pain.RESULTS: Survey respondents (N = 106) were 58% female and on average 64 years old. RT sites included lung, breast, lower abdomen, head/neck/brain, and upper abdomen. Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in treatment site pain and skin problems (P < or = .007). Patients receiving head/neck/brain RT reported increased skin problems (P < .0009). MLR showed that post-RT skin tenderness and tightness were most strongly associated with post-RT pain (P = .066 and P = .122, respectively).LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, exploratory analyses, and nonvalidated measure.CONCLUSIONS: Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in pain and skin problems at the RT site while patients receiving head/neck/brain RT had increased skin problems but not pain. These findings suggest that the severity of skin problems is not the only factor that contributes to pain and that interventions should be tailored to specifically target pain at the RT site, possibly by targeting tenderness and tightness. These findings should be confirmed in a larger sampling of RT patients.",Excluded
1460,"Dosimetric consequences of translational and rotational errors in frame-less image-guided radiosurgery BACKGROUND: To investigate geometric and dosimetric accuracy of frame-less image-guided radiosurgery (IG-RS) for brain metastases.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Single fraction IG-RS was practiced in 72 patients with 98 brain metastases. Patient positioning and immobilization used either double- (n = 71) or single-layer (n = 27) thermoplastic masks. Pre-treatment set-up errors (n = 98) were evaluated with cone-beam CT (CBCT) based image-guidance (IG) and were corrected in six degrees of freedom without an action level. CBCT imaging after treatment measured intra-fractional errors (n = 64). Pre- and post-treatment errors were simulated in the treatment planning system and target coverage and dose conformity were evaluated. Three scenarios of 0 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm GTV-to-PTV (gross tumor volume, planning target volume) safety margins (SM) were simulated.RESULTS: Errors prior to IG were 3.9 mm +/- 1.7 mm (3D vector) and the maximum rotational error was 1.7degree +/- 0.8degree on average. The post-treatment 3D error was 0.9 mm +/- 0.6 mm. No differences between double- and single-layer masks were observed. Intra-fractional errors were significantly correlated with the total treatment time with 0.7 mm +/- 0.5 mm and 1.2 mm +/- 0.7 mm for treatment times <=23 minutes and >23 minutes (p<0.01), respectively. Simulation of RS without image-guidance reduced target coverage and conformity to 75% +/- 19% and 60% +/- 25% of planned values. Each 3D set-up error of 1 mm decreased target coverage and dose conformity by 6% and 10% on average, respectively, with a large inter-patient variability. Pre-treatment correction of translations only but not rotations did not affect target coverage and conformity. Post-treatment errors reduced target coverage by >5% in 14% of the patients. A 1 mm safety margin fully compensated intra-fractional patient motion.CONCLUSIONS: IG-RS with online correction of translational errors achieves high geometric and dosimetric accuracy. Intra-fractional errors decrease target coverage and conformity unless compensated with appropriate safety margins.",Excluded

2258,"A review of management strategies of malignant gliomas in the elderly population Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumor in adults. It is an aggressive primary brain neoplasm, associated with a poor prognosis and median survival of less than 1 year. Approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with malignant gliomas in the United States are over the age of 65. Advancing age and poor performance status are two variables that have found to negatively affect prognosis. When compared to younger patients, not only is the treatment of elderly patients associated with decreased efficacy but also greater toxicity. As a result, elderly patients often receive less aggressive treatment and are excluded from clinical trials. There are many challenges in the treatment of elderly patients with GBM including increased surgical morbidity and mortality as well as increased toxicity to radiation and chemotherapy. As such, the optimal therapy remains unclear and controversial for the elderly malignant glioma population.",Excluded

Predisposing factors include postmenopausal osteoporosis, corticosteroids, and local irradiation. Differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease to bone. We present the case of a 65-year-old woman who had a two-month history of low back pain and left groin pain. Her medical history included osteoporosis and endometrial cancer that was treated with radiation therapy to the pelvis 1 year prior to presentation. Despite bed rest, analgesics, and therapeutic modalities, her pain remained intractable and prevented ambulation. Plain radiographs showed no fracture. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging showed fractures of the pelvis but were suggestive of malignancy. CT-guided bone biopsy was consistent with radiation osteonecrosis. After diagnosis and continued therapy, the patient progressed to ambulation with moderate discomfort. Failure to diagnose insufficiency fractures could lead to further pelvic irradiation, compromising already weakened bones and causing prolonged disability.",Excluded
1394,"Analyses of prognostic factors in cases of non-small cell lung cancer with multiple brain metastases Aim: To observe the therapeutic efficacy and prognostic factors that influence survival rates in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with multiple brain metastases (BMs), (more than three and less than ten). Method(s): Retrospective analyses were conducted on the clinical data of 209 NSCLC patients with multiple BMs and were admitted to our hospital between March 2007 and November 2012. All BM patients received whole-brain radiotherapy. Two hundred patients received combined chemotherapy during the treatment process; 99 received targeted drug therapy; and nine got only symptomatic and supportive treatment. Survival time was defined as the period from the start of BM therapy to the patient's death or end of the follow-up period. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the median survival time, and the 6-month, 1-, and 2-year cumulative survival rates, as well as to plot the survival curves. The patients' cultural background included their socioeconomic status, level of education, their understanding of the disease, and the degree of care and support they received from their family members. Log-rank test was employed to test the differences in the survival rates between the subgroups. Cox multivariate regression analyses were used to analyze the various factors influencing the prognoses of NSCLC with multiple BMs. Result(s): The follow-up duration was between 1 and 87 months. The median survival time for all BM patients was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 9.37-14.83). The 6-month, 1-, and 2-year cumulative survival rates were 80%, 50.2%, and 10.7%, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that the independent factors influencing survival prognoses included Karnofsky Performance Status score, control of the primary lung tumor, interval between the confirmed diagnoses of lung cancer and BM, presence of extracranial metastasis, number of chemotherapy cycles undergone, Graded Prognostic Assessment class, administration of combined targeted drug therapy, the pathological type, and the cultural backgrounds of the patients. Multivariate analyses indicated that the number of chemotherapy cycles, administration of combined drug therapy, and patients' cultural background were key independent factors influencing survival prognoses. Conclusion(s): Active treatment of NSCLC with multiple BMs was beneficial, and the patients' cultural background had a strong influence on survival prognoses. Chemotherapy combined with targeted drug therapy could increase the patients' median and overall survival rates. The number of chemotherapy cycles undergone, administration of combined targeted drug therapy, and the cultural backgrounds of the patients had significant effects on the patients' survival prognoses.

An initial report Introduction: Most patients with neuroendocrine tumors present liver metastases at some point of the clinical course. Liver directed treatment, such as 90 Yttrium is a method of treatment used in patients with non-resectable liver lesions, which is effective in the control of symptoms and tumor growth. Aim(s): To describe clinical outcome of patients treated with 90 Yttrium embolisation, in term of toxicity and efficacy. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospectively collected database of 68 patients treated with SIRT spheres, with different etiologies, was analysed. We reviewed 11 patients with liver neuroendocrine metastases, who underwent 90Yttrium embolisation procedures. Result(s): neuroendocrine tumors originated from the small bowell 54% were included. The median age was 62 years at treatment. According to WHO criteria all were well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Clinical response was assessed using WHO and RECIST criteria. Seventy-two percent were clinical responders (partial response and stable disease) and more than 60% of the cases showed control of symptoms. There was no acute toxicity during procedures. No radiation liver failure occurred. Fatigue and increase of liver enzymes were the most frequent toxicities.

2067,"X-ray and optical stereo-based 3D sensor fusion system for image-guided neurosurgery Purpose: In neurosurgery, an image-guided operation is performed to confirm that the surgical instruments reach the exact lesion position. Among the multiple imaging modalities, an X-ray fluoroscope mounted on C- or O-arm is widely used for monitoring the position of surgical instruments and the target position of the patient. However, frequently used fluoroscopy can result in relatively high radiation doses, particularly for complex interventional procedures. The proposed system can reduce radiation exposure and provide the accurate three-dimensional (3D) position information of surgical instruments and the target position. Method(s): X-ray and optical stereo vision systems have been proposed for the C- or O-arm. Two subsystems have same optical axis and are calibrated simultaneously. This provides easy augmentation of the camera image and the X-ray image. Further, the 3D measurement of both systems can be defined in a common coordinate space. Result(s): The proposed dual stereoscopic imaging system is designed and implemented for mounting on an O-arm. The calibration error of the 3D coordinates of the optical stereo and X-ray stereo is within 0.1 mm in terms of the mean and the standard deviation. Further, image augmentation with the camera image and the X-ray image using an artificial skull phantom is achieved. Conclusion(s): As the developed dual stereoscopic imaging system provides 3D coordinates of the point of interest in both optical images and fluoroscopic images, it can be used by surgeons to confirm the position of surgical instruments in a 3D space with minimum radiation exposure and to verify whether the instruments reach the surgical target observed in fluoroscopic images.
