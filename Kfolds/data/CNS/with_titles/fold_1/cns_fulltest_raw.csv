1198,"Radiation necrosis or glioma recurrence: is computer-assisted stereotactic biopsy useful?. Fifty-one patients with supratentorial glioma treated with external beam radiotherapy (median dose 59.5 Gy) who then demonstrated clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression underwent stereotactic biopsy to differentiate tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis. The original tumor histological type was diffuse or fibrillary astrocytoma in 21 patients (41%), oligodendroglioma in 13 (26%), and oligoastrocytoma in 17 (33%); 40 tumors (78%) were low-grade (Kernohan Grade 1 or 2). The median time to suspected disease progression was 28 months. Stereotactic biopsy showed tumor recurrence in 30 patients (59%), radiation necrosis in three (6%), and a mixture of both in 17 (33%); one patient (2%) had a parenchymal radiation-induced chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The tumor type at stereotactic biopsy was similar to the original tumor type and was astrocytoma in 24 patients (47%), oligodendroglioma in eight (16%), oligoastrocytoma in 16 (31%), unclassifiable in two (4%), and chondroblastic osteosarcoma in one patient (2%). At biopsy, however, only 19 tumors (37%) were low grade (Kernohan Grade 1 or 2). Subsequent surgery confirmed the stereotactic biopsy histological findings in eight patients. Follow-up examination showed 14 patients alive with a median survival of 1 year for the entire group. Median survival times after biopsy were 0.83 year for patients with tumor recurrence and 1.86 years for patients with both tumor recurrence and radionecrosis; these findings were significantly different (p = 0.008, log-rank test). No patient with radiation necrosis alone died. Other factors associated with reduced survival were a high proportion of residual tumor (p = 0.024), a low proportion of radionecrosis (p < 0.001), and a Kernohan Grade of 3 or 4 (p = 0.005). In conclusion, in patients with previously irradiated supratentorial gliomas in whom radionecrosis or tumor recurrence was clinically or radiographically suspected, results of stereotactic biopsy could be used to differentiate tumor recurrence, radiation necrosis, a mixture of both lesions, or radiation-induced neoplasm. In addition, biopsy results could predict survival rates.",Excluded
1199,"Short- and long-term morbidity after treatment for testicular cancer. Patients with testicular cancer are at risk of having severe short-term and life-threatening long-term effects; we reviewed previous reports of these sequelae. After orchidectomy and before further treatment patients have major mental distress which gradually decreases during the treatment phase. Gastrointestinal side-effects dominate during both chemo- and radiotherapy, with the risk of severe haematological, infectious and thromboembolic complications during chemotherapy. Long-term sequelae comprise second cancers, cardiovascular morbidity/mortality and gonadal dysfunction. Nevertheless, 70% of patients who attempt paternity after treatment are successful. About 20% of patients develop long-term neuro- and/or ototoxicity. The long-term quality of life of survivors of testicular cancer is comparable to that of controls. Risk-adapted treatment of patients with testicular cancer and adequate follow-up of those at risk of life-threatening toxicity are ways to reduce the short- and long-term morbidity in survivors. Patients should be informed about these potential complications and the importance of adjusting their lifestyle (e.g. smoking habits, physical activity and weight control).

1200,"Interaction between tissue oxygen tension and NADH imaging during synaptic stimulation and hypoxia in rat hippocampal slices. Oxygen and NADH are essential components in the production of ATP in the CNS. This study examined the dynamic interaction between tissue oxygen tension (pO(2)) and NADH imaging changes within hippocampal tissue slices, during metabolic stresses including hypoxia and synaptic activation. The initiation of abrupt hypoxia (from 95% O(2) to 95% N(2)) caused a rapid decrease in pO(2), onset of hypoxic spreading depression (hsd; at 6.7+/-1.3 mm Hg; n=15), and a monophasic increase in NADH. Provided that reoxygenation was prompt, synaptic responses, pO(2) and NADH levels returned to baseline following hsd. Longer hypoxia caused irreversible neuronal dysfunction, an increase in pO(2) beyond baseline (due to decreased tissue demand), and hyperoxidation of NADH (10+/-2% decrease below baseline; n=7). Synaptic activation in ambient 95% O(2) caused a decrease or 'initial dip' in pO(2) and a biphasic NADH response (oxidation followed by reduction). The oxidizing phase of the NADH response was mitochondrial as it was synchronous with the 'initial' dip in pO(2). Following slow graded reductions in ambient oxygen levels to 8%, four of seven slices developed hsd following synaptic stimulation. The hypoxic threshold for graded oxygen reductions occurred at 7.9+/-5.8 mm Hg O(2) (n=7). Our hypoxic threshold range (6.7-7.9 mm Hg O(2) from abrupt and graded oxygen reduction, respectively) correlates well with reported in vivo values of <12 mm Hg O(2). The major findings of this study include: 1) determination of the critical physiological threshold of pO(2) (based upon hsd), which is a marker of imminent neuronal death if oxygen is not rapidly restored; 2) NADH hyperoxidation and an increase in pO(2) beyond baseline levels following longer periods of hypoxia; and 3) the occurrence of a pO(2) 'dip' during synaptic stimulation, which correlates with the early oxidizing phase of the biphasic NADH response.",Excluded

1203,"Potential role for LINAC-based stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of 5 or more radioresistant melanoma brain metastases. OBJECT: Linear accelerator (LINAC)-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment option for patients with melanoma in whom brain metastases have developed. Very limited data are available on treating patients with >=5 lesions. The authors sought to determine the effectiveness of SRS in patients with >=5 melanoma brain metastases.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of metastatic melanoma treated with SRS in a single treatment session for >=5 lesions was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were reviewed post-SRS to evaluate local control (LC). Disease progression on imaging was defined using the 2009 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Survival curves were calculated from the date of brain metastases diagnosis or the date of SRS by using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Univariate and multivariate analysis (UVA and MVA, respectively) were performed using the Cox proportional-hazards model.RESULTS: The authors identified 149 metastatic brain lesions treated in 28 patients. The median patient age was 60.5 years (range 38-83 years), and the majority of patients (24 [85.7%]) had extracranial metastases. Four patients (14.3%) had received previous whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and 11 (39.3%) had undergone previous SRS. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 0.34 cm3 (range 0.01-12.5 cm3). Median follow-up was 6.3 months (range 1-46 months). At the time of treatment, 7% of patients were categorized as recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class I, 89% as RPA Class II, and 4% as RPA Class III. The rate of local failure was 11.4%. Kaplan-Meier LC estimates at 6 and 12 months were 91.3% and 82.2%, respectively. A PTV volume>=0.34 cm3 was a significant predictor of local failure on UVA (HR 16.1, 95% CI 3.2-292.6, p<0.0001) and MVA (HR 14.8, 95% CI 3.0-268.5, p=0.0002). Sixteen patients (57.1%) were noted to have distant failure in the brain with a median time to failure of 3 months (range 1-15 months). Nine patients with distant failures received WBRT, and 7 received additional SRS. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.4 and 7.6 months from the date of brain metastases diagnosis and the date of SRS, respectively. The KM OS estimates at 6 and 12 months were 57.8% and 28.2%, respectively, from the time of SRS treatment. The RPA class was a significant predictor of KM OS estimates from the date of treatment (p=0.02). Patients who did not receive WBRT after SRS treatment had decreased OS on MVA (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-12.0, p=0.03), and patients who did not receive WBRT prior to SRS had improved OS (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.53, p=0.007).CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery for >=5 lesions appears to be effective for selected patients with metastatic melanoma, offering excellent LC. This is particularly important for patients as new targeted systemic agents are improving outcomes but still have limited efficacy within the central nervous system.",Excluded
1204,"Lipid bilayer and water proton magnetization transfer: effect of cholesterol. Magnetization transfer between macromolecules and water can be a significant factor contributing to tissue water 1H relaxation. Using saturation transfer techniques, the degree of magnetization transfer between the macromolecular matrix and bulk water 1H can be directly measured and magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) can be generated in MR images. A significant degree of MTC has been observed in tissues with high plasma membrane content such as kidney and brain. The purpose of this study was to establish whether lipid bilayers, as models for cell membranes, could exchange magnetization with the water solvent and whether this effect could contribute to MTC observed in intact tissues. Magnetization transfer was measured in aqueous dispersions of egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) in the presence and absence of cholesterol. It was found that neither EPC bilayers nor cholesterol by themselves significantly exchanged magnetization with bulk water 1H. However, as the concentration of cholesterol was increased, the pseudo-first-order magnetization exchange rate increased to a maximum value of approximately 1 s-1. The cholesterol-induced 1H magnetization exchange may be related either to longer correlation times of the lipid or to an increase in the number of water molecules associated with the bilayer. These results indicate that EPC-cholesterol bilayers exchange 1H magnetization with bulk water. These results are consistent with lipid bilayer contributions to bulk water relaxation and MTC in intact biological tissues.",Excluded
1205,"Diffuse optical imaging of the whole head. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and diffuse optical imaging (DOI) are increasingly used to detect hemodynamic changes in the cerebral cortex induced by brain activity. Until recently, the small number of optodes in NIRS instruments has hampered measurement of optical signals from diverse brain regions. Our new DOI system has 32 detectors and 32 sources; by arranging them in a specific pattern, we can cover most of the adult head. With the increased number of optodes, we can collect optical data from prefrontal, sensorimotor, and visual cortices in both hemispheres simultaneously. We describe the system and report system characterization measurements on phantoms as well as on human subjects at rest and during visual, motor, and cognitive stimulation. Taking advantage of the system's larger number of sources and detectors, we explored the spatiotemporal patterns of physiological signals during rest. These physiological signals, arising from cardiac, respiratory, and blood-pressure modulations, interfere with measurement of the hemodynamic response to brain stimulation. Whole-head optical measurements, in addition to providing maps of multiple brain regions' responses to brain activation, will enable better understandings of the physiological signals, ultimately leading to better signal processing algorithms to distinguish physiological signal clutter from brain activation signals.",Excluded
1206,"Local irradiation not only induces homing of human mesenchymal stem cells at exposed sites but promotes their widespread engraftment to multiple organs: A study of their quantitative distribution after irradiation damage. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to migrate to various tissues. There is little information on the fate and potential therapeutic efficacy of the reinfusion of MSCs following total body irradiation (TBI). We addressed this question using human MSC (hMSCs) infused to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to TBI. Further, we tested the impact of additional local irradiation (ALI) superimposed to TBI, as a model of accidental irradiation. NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with hMSCs. Group 1 was not irradiated before receiving hMSC infusion. Group 2 received only TBI at a dose of 3.5 Gy, group 3 received local irradiation to the abdomen at a dose of 4.5 Gy in addition to TBI, and group 4 received local irradiation to the leg at 26.5 Gy in addition to TBI. Fifteen days after irradiation, quantitative and spatial distribution of the hMSCs were studied. Histological analysis of mouse tissues confirmed the presence of radio-induced lesions in the irradiated fields. Following their infusion into nonirradiated animals, hMSCs homed at a very low level to various tissues (lung, bone marrow, and muscles) and no significant engraftment was found in other organs. TBI induced an increase of engraftment levels of hMSCs in the brain, heart, bone marrow, and muscles. Abdominal irradiation (AI) as compared with leg irradiation (LI) increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (the gut, liver, and spleen). Hind LI as compared with AI increased hMSC engraftment in the exposed area (skin, quadriceps, and muscles). An increase of hMSC engraftment in organs outside the fields of the ALI was also observed. Conversely, following LI, hMSC engraftment was increased in the brain as compared with AI. This study shows that engraftment of hMSCs in NOD/SCID mice with significantly increased in response to tissue injuries following TBI with or without ALI. ALI induced an increase of the level of engraftment at sites outside the local irradiation field, thus suggesting a distant (abscopal) effect of radiation damage. This work supports the use of MSCs to repair damaged normal tissues following accidental irradiation and possibly in patients submitted to radiotherapy. ©AlphaMed Press.",Excluded
1207,"Light and vision in the deep-sea benthos: II. Vision in deep-sea crustaceans. Using new collecting techniques with the Johnson-Sea-Link submersible, eight species of deep-sea benthic crustaceans were collected with intact visual systems. Their spectral sensitivities and temporal resolutions were determined shipboard using electroretinography. Useable spectral sensitivity data were obtained from seven species, and in the dark-adapted eyes, the spectral sensitivity peaks were in the blue region of the visible spectrum, ranging from 470 to 497 nm. Under blue chromatic adaptation, a secondary sensitivity peak in the UV portion of the spectrum appeared for two species of anomuran crabs: Eumunida picta (lambda(max)363 nm) and Gastroptychus spinifer (lambda(max)383 nm). Wavelength-specific differences in response waveforms under blue chromatic adaptation in these two species suggest that two populations of photoreceptor cells are present. Temporal resolution was determined in all eight species using the maximum critical flicker frequency (CFF(max)). The CFF(max) for the isopod Booralana tricarinata of 4 Hz proved to be the lowest ever measured using this technique, and suggests that this species is not able to track even slow-moving prey. Both the putative dual visual pigment system in the crabs and the extremely slow eye of the isopod may be adaptations for seeing bioluminescence in the benthic environment.",Excluded
1208,"Inhibition decorrelates visual feature representations in the inner retina. The retina extracts visual features for transmission to the brain. Different types of bipolar cell split the photoreceptor input into parallel channels and provide the excitatory drive for downstream visual circuits. Mouse bipolar cell types have been described at great anatomical and genetic detail, but a similarly deep understanding of their functional diversity is lacking. Here, by imaging light-driven glutamate release from more than 13,000 bipolar cell axon terminals in the intact retina, we show that bipolar cell functional diversity is generated by the interplay of dendritic excitatory inputs and axonal inhibitory inputs. The resulting centre and surround components of bipolar cell receptive fields interact to decorrelate bipolar cell output in the spatial and temporal domains. Our findings highlight the importance of inhibitory circuits in generating functionally diverse excitatory pathways and suggest that decorrelation of parallel visual pathways begins as early as the second synapse of the mouse visual system.",Excluded
1209,"Stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife radiosurgery of cystic brain metastasis. Object. Treatment options for patients with brain metastasis include tumor resection, whole-brain radiation therapy, and radiosurgery. A single treatment is not useful in cases of multiple tumors, of which at least 1 is a cystic tumor. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in the treatment of cystic brain metastasis. Methods. Between January 2001 and November 2005, 680 consecutive patients with brain metastases underwent GKS at our hospital, 30 of whom were included in this study (18 males and 12 females, mean age 60.6 +/- 11 years, range 38-75 years). Inclusion criteria were: 1) no prior whole-brain radiation therapy or resection procedure; 2) a maximum of 4 lesions on preoperative MR imaging; 3) at least 1 cystic lesion; 4) a Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 70; and 5) histological diagnosis of a malignant tumor. Results. Non-small cell lung carcinoma was the primary cancer in most patients (19 patients [63.3%]). A single metastasis was present in 13 patients (43.3%). There was a total of 81 tumors, 33 of which were cystic. Ten patients (33.3%) were in recursive partitioning analysis Class I, and 20 (66.6%) were in Class II. Before drainage the mean tumor volume was 21.8 ml (range 3.8-68 ml); before GKS the mean tumor volume was 10.1 ml (range 1.2-32 ml). The mean prescription dose to the tumor margin was 19.5 Gy (range 12-25 Gy). Overall median patient survival was 15 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 54.7% (95% confidence interval 45.3-64.1%) and 34.2% (95% confidence interval 23.1-45.3%). Local tumor control was achieved in 91.3% of the patients.

1210,"New approaches in primary central nervous system lymphoma. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has long been associated with an inferior prognosis compared to other aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs).

One recent approach that has reproducibly demonstrated efficacy for newly diagnosed PCNSL patients is an immunochemotherapy combination regimen used during induction that consists of methotrexate, temozolomide, and rituximab followed by consolidative infusional etoposide plus high-dose cytarabine (EA), administered in first complete remission (CR). Other high-dose chemotherapy-based consolidative regimens have shown efficacy as well.

The size and the orientation of the bone salt (mineral) crystals in the cranial and caudal zones in the transverse midshaft section of the equine radius were investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The results are interpreted as indicating that the crystals had an elongated shape with an average thickness of T = 3.17 +/- 0. 15 nm in the caudal region and T = 3.79 +/- 0.20 nm in the cranial region. Their orientation was predominantly in the longitudinal direction of the bone. There was no preferential orientation within the transverse plane. The distribution of tilt angles with respect to the longitudinal direction was determined directly from the SAXS data: the average angle was about 30 degrees for the cranial region and 45 degrees for the caudal region.

1213,"Data collection procedures for bone marrow dosimetry in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 177Lu-DOTATATE on neuroendocrine tumors. Introduction: By medio 2012 Rigshospitalet has treated more than 60 patients with neuroendocrine tumors with 177Lu-Dotatate. Patients are scheduled for 4 treatments with 8-10 weeks in between. Cells in the red bone marrow are vulnerable to radiation and are together with the kidneys the organs at risk in patients undergoing 177Lu-Dotatate therapy. The effective dose given to the red bone marrow can be estimated from the calculated accumulated radioactivity in the blood. Aim(s): To described the procedure for collection of blood samples, measurement of radioactivity in the blood and for estimating the effective dose to bone marrow following 177Lu-Dotatate therapy. Method(s): At the first treatment a total of eight blood samples is collected at the following time points: 45, 90, 150 and 210 minutes, 8 and 24 hours, and 4 and 7 days after the administration of 177Lu-Dotatate. For the following three treatments no blood samples are collected at day 4 and 7, resulting in a total of six samples. The first four blood samples are drawn from a venflon or venipuncture in the opposite arm of the infusion of the radionuclide in order to avoid contamination of the samples. The exact time of sampling is recorded for all blood samples. The activity of Lu-177 in the blood is so high shortly after administration that even small sample volumes causes lack of accuracy due to the dead time of the counting apparatus. Therefore samples are stored for seven days before they are prepared for counting. Measurements during the development of the data collection procedure showed that the radioactivity was at least 1.5 greater in whole blood than in plasma. Measurement of radioactivity is therefore done on whole blood from which samples of 500 muL blood is taken. The amount of Lu-177 in the 500 muL blood samples (duplicate samples for every time point) is measured in a well counter (Canberra Cobra-II auto-gamma) using a 15-400 keV window and a counting time of 10 min which is sufficient for good count statistics. Based on the measured cpm/sample the Lu-177 concentration in the blood (Bq/ml) is calculated for every time point and the result are plotted in a time-activity graph. Conclusion(s): It is possible to measure accumulated radioactivity in the blood over time and thereby estimate the effective dose to the red bone marrow using a time-activity graph obtained from the described procedure.",Excluded

Risk of brain metastases (BM) affects a remarkable number of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, impacting on their quality of life (QoL) and prognosis. While tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) showed interesting intracranial control rates in oncogene-addicted NSCLC, BM still represent an unmet need for the counterpart without driver gene mutations. For these patients, new treatment options include anti-angiogenic drugs and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, possibly combined with standard chemotherapy, even though the benefit on BM has not been clearly defined. A multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons, medical and radiation oncologists is needed in order to integrate systemic and loco-regional strategies at the right time point. Ad-hoc designed clinical trials are slowly emerging for previously treated patients with uncontrolled BM. The aim of this review is to offer a detailed and updated picture of possible approaches for non oncogene-addicted NSCLC patients having BM, in order to support clinicians in their daily practice.

1216,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment for epilepsy: can it also improve depression and vice versa?. Comorbidity with depression is an important determinant of the quality of life for patients with epilepsy. Antidepressant medications can effectively treat depression in epileptic patients, but drug-drug interactions and epileptogenic effects of these drugs pose therapeutic challenges. The mood-stabilizing effects of antiepileptic medications may not be sufficient to treat depression. Therefore, treatments that alleviate the burden of depression without increasing seizure risk or, better yet, with the possibility of improving seizure control are worth exploring. Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, are providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of depression in epilepsy. For example, there appears to be prominent brain prefrontal hypoactivity, which may be sustained by the hyperactivity of the seizure focus. If so, neuromodulatory approaches that suppress epileptic focus hyperactivity and concurrently enhance prefrontal activity may be ideally suited. Indeed, vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to yield simultaneous antiseizure and mood effects. Another neuromodulatory technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), can also modulate brain activity, but in a noninvasive, painless, and focal manner. Depending on the stimulation parameters, it is possible to enhance or reduce activity in the targeted brain region. Furthermore, TMS has been shown to be effective in treating depression, and preliminary data suggest that this treatment may also be effective for epilepsy treatment. This article reviews these data and explores further the question of whether depression and epilepsy can be simultaneously treated with TMS for optimal therapeutic impact. [References: 88]",Excluded
1217,"Routine Postoperative Computed Tomography Is Not Helpful After Elective Craniotomy. Background: Next-day postoperative computed tomography (CT) has been routinely used to obtain radiographic ""clearance"" for transferring patients after elective craniotomy out of the intensive care unit. The value of this traditional policy, however, has repeatedly been questioned. However, the limited patient numbers might have underestimated the very rare, but catastrophic, events. Therefore, we analyzed the value of routine postoperative CT in a larger cohort of elective tumor, epilepsy, and vascular cases. Method(s): All the patients who had undergone elective craniotomy were included in our study. The routine postoperative CT scans were analyzed by a neuroradiologist who was unaware of the clinical data. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed for events of arterial hypertension and clinical deterioration. Result(s): The data from 660 patients with tumors (n = 393; 59.5%), aneurysms (n = 107; 16.2%), and skull base lesions were evaluated. In nearly one half of the patients (n = 264; 45.8%), CT depicted the presence of blood that was not associated with symptoms. Of the 660 patients, 21 (3.6%) showed a mass effect radiographically, 11 of whom underwent revision surgery. Arterial hypertension was documented in only 8 patients (1.3%) and was related to the revision surgery (P = 0.018). The overall revision rate was 2.7% (n = 18). All patients who had undergone revision for postoperative hematoma had presented with a new neurological deficit immediately before CT. Conclusion(s): Routine postoperative CT did not reveal 1 patient with a serious hematoma that would not have been identified by clinical examination. Patients could be transferred safely from the intensive care unit, if the weaning process and clinical observation findings were uneventful, without deterioration of neurological symptoms or consciousness.

1221,"Co-aggregation of ganglioside-containing membranes and alpha-synuclein. Parkinson's disease (PD) is accompanied by the formation of Lewy bodies, whose main components are fibrils of the protein alpha-synuclein.

Ganglioside lipids are abundant in neuronal membranes and have been found to accelerate fibril formation [1] and to accumulate in PD brains. We address the effects of ganglioside-phospholipid (GM3-POPC) model membranes on the dynamics (regarding the order parameter and the correlation time of C-H bond reorientation) and structure of co-aggregates with alpha-synuclein using polarization-transfer 13C solid-state NMR [2], wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) and cryogenic electron microscopy. 31P NMR powder patterns were recorded to monitor the lipid phase behavior and the spinning sidebands at 1250 Hz MAS were used to fit the chemical shift anisotropy before and after coaggregation. It was found that both lipids are co-assembled with alpha-synuclein with reduced headgroup and acyl chain mobility, and that the mobility of alpha-synuclein is modulated by the lipid-to-protein ratio and membrane composition. As the ganglioside content of membranes was increased the mobility of alanine residues is affected, implying a modulation of the fibril core which could impact the fibrillation propensity. These effects of co-aggregation on alpha-synuclein fibril mobility are currently being further investigated by us and raises questions on the specific lipid-protein interactions and the organization of lipids inside coaggregates.",Excluded

Under dark-adapted conditions the rod response derived by the paired-flash technique (in response to a relatively dim test flash) peaked at ca 120 ms, with a fractional sensitivity at the peak of ca 0.1 Td(-1) s(-1). 4. As reported previously, background illumination reduced the maximal response, reflecting a reduction in rod circulating current. In addition, it shortened the time to peak (to ca 70 ms at an intensity of 170 Td), and reduced the flash sensitivity measured at the peak. The flash sensitivity declined approximately according to Weber's Law, with a 10-fold reduction occurring at an intensity of 100-200 Td. We could not reliably measure responses at significantly higher background intensities because the circulating current became so small. 5. In order to investigate the phototransduction process after correction for response compression, we expressed the derived response as a fraction of the maximal response that could be elicited in the presence of the background. The earliest rising phase of this 'fractional response per unit intensity' was little affected by background illumination, suggesting that the amplification constant of transduction was unaltered by light adaptation.",Excluded

Information on the mental status of soldiers operating at the limits of human tolerance will be vital to their management in future deployments; it may also allow earlier intervention for conditions such as undiagnosed Gulf War illnesses and Parkinson's Disease. The Army needs a parsimonious set of neuropsychological tests that reliably identify subtle changes for: (1) early detection of individual health and military performance impairments and (2) management of occupational and deployment health risks. Testing must characterize cognitive lapses in healthy individuals faced with relevant operational stressors (i.e., anxiety, information overload, thermal strain, hypoxia, fatigue, head impact, chemical or radiation exposures, metabolic challenges). This effort must also explore the neuropsychological methods in militarily relevant conditions to extend our understanding of relevant functional domains and how well they correspond to modes of testing.

Chlorotoxin, one of the key toxins in scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus venom, has been shown to bind specifically to glioma cell surface as a specific chloride channel blocker. In this study, a purified, recombinant chlorotoxin-like peptide from the scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch (named rBmK CTa) was characterized by in vivo and in vitro studies. The results from cell proliferation assay with human glioma (SHG-44) cells showed that rBmK CTa inhibits the growth of glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of approximately 0.28microM. Under the same conditions, the IC(50) value for normal astrocytes increased to 8microM. This clearly indicated that rBmK CTa had specific toxicity against glioma cells but not astrocytes. Results from whole-cell patch-clamp recording showed that chloride current in SHG-44 was inhibited by rBmK CTa in a voltage-dependent manner and percent inhibitions for the blocking action of rBmK CTa (0.07 and 0.14microM) on I(Cl) was 17.64+/-3.06% and 55.86+/-2.83%, respectively. Histological analysis of rBmK CTa treated mice showed that brain, leg muscle and cardiac muscle were the target organs of this toxin.

1231,"The cortically evoked secondary depolarization affects the integrative properties of thalamic reticular neurons. Corticothalamic terminals on thalamic reticular (RE) neurons account for most synapses from afferent pathways onto this nucleus and these inputs are more powerful than those from axon collaterals of thalamocortical neurons. Given the supremacy of cortical inputs, we analysed here the characteristics and possible mechanisms underlying a secondary component of the cortically elicited depolarization in RE neurons, recorded in cats under barbiturate anesthesia. Electrical stimulation of corticothalamic axons in the internal capsule evoked fixed and short-latency excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that, by increasing stimulation intensity and at hyperpolarized levels (< -70 mV), developed into low-threshold spikes and spindle oscillations. The threshold for spindle oscillations was 60% higher than that required for evoking minimal EPSPs. The evoked EPSPs included a secondary depolarizing component, which appeared approximately 5 ms after the peak of the initial component and was voltage dependent, i.e. most prominent between -70 mV and -85 mV, while being greatly reduced or absent at more hyperpolarized levels. The secondary depolarizing component was sensitive to QX-314 in the recording micropipette. We suggest that the secondary component of cortically evoked EPSPs in RE neurons is due to the dendritic activation of T-currents, with a probable contribution of the persistent Na+ current. This late component affected the integrative properties of RE neurons, including their spiking output and temporal summation of incoming cortical inputs.",Excluded
1232,"Stereotactic LINAC radiosurgery for the treatment of brainstem cavernomas. BACKGROUND: The management of deep-seated cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) is still controversial. Although surgery remains the treatment of choice in patients with recurrent hemorrhage, patients with CCMs located in the brainstem are in many cases not eligible for resection due to high procedure-related morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the long-term outcome of LINAC radiosurgery (LINAC-RS) for the treatment of brainstem CCMs.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1992 and March 2008, 14 patients (6 men, 8 women) harboring brainstem CCMs underwent LINAC-RS. Pretreatment neuroimaging showed no associated developmental venous angiomas (DVAs) in any of our patients. Prior to treatment, all patients suffered at least from one symptomatic hemorrhage (median 1.8, range 1-3). A median follow-up of 7.1 years (range 2.0-16.8 years) could be obtained in 12 patients. We applied a median tumor surface dose of 13.9 Gy (range 11-18 Gy; median tumor volume 1.6 ml, range 0.4-4.3 ml).RESULTS: Following LINAC-RS, neurological outcome improved in 4 (33.3%) and remained unchanged in 8 patients (66.7%). Rebleeding with subsequent transient neurological status deterioration occurred in 4 patients (33.3%), leading to additional surgical resection in 2 patients (16.7%). The corresponding annual hemorrhage rate was 4.8% (4/82.8 patient-years). Adverse radiation effects (ARE, defined by perilesional hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR images) were revealed in 3 patients (25%), leading to transient neurological deficits in 2 patients (16.7%). There were no procedure-related complications leading to either permanent morbidity or mortality.CONCLUSION: Our results support the role of LINAC-RS as an efficient and safe treatment to significantly reduce the annual hemorrhage rate in patients suffering from brainstem CCMs not eligible to microsurgery. Compared with radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the intervention-related morbidity is higher.",Excluded

1237,"Improvement of dose distribution with irregular surface compensator in whole brain radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dosimetries of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) using irregular surface compensator (ISC) compare with conventional radiotherapy. The ISC involves modulation of the beam with the multileaf collimator (MLC), and increases the dose homogeneity to the target volume while decrease the absorbed dose in irradiated tissues outside the targeted tissue. Treatment plans were produced for 10 patients. All treatments were carried out with 10 MV photon energy from a Clinac iX with 120 MLC (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The prescription dose was 30 Gy in 10 fractions at the isocenter. With Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems), the anisotropic analytical algorithm was used for the dose calculation. The tissue heterogeneity correction was used in all the treatment plans. For ISC, the skin flash tool application was used to extend the optimal fluence. These two treatment plans were compared in terms of does in the planning target volume (PTV), the dose homogeneity index (DHI), the maximum doses, eye and lens doses and the monitor unit (MU) counts required for treatment. Average values were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Compared with the conventional WBRT, the ISC significantly reduced the DHI, the maximum dose, the volumes received at 105% of the prescription dose, as well as reducing both eye and lens doses (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). By contrast, the monitor unit counts were increased for ISC technique compared to the conventional WBRT (819 vs. 327, p < 0.01). The ISC technique for WBRT enables significantly better dose distribution in the PTV. As patients who receive WBRT have improved survival, the long-term side effects of radiotherapy become of increasing important.

1239,"Induced radioactivity in the blood of cancer patients following Boron Neutron Capture Therapy. Since 1990, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) has been used for over 400 cancer patients at the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURRI). After BNCT, the patients are radioactive and their (24)Na and (38)Cl levels can be detected via a Na-I scintillation counter. This activity is predominantly due to (24)Na, which has a half-life of 14.96 h and thus remains in the body for extended time periods. Radioactive (24)Na is mainly generated from (23)Na in the target tissue that is exposed to the neutron beam in BNCT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the radioactivity of blood (24)Na following BNCT and the absorbed gamma ray dose in the irradiated field. To assess blood (24)Na, 1 ml of peripheral blood was collected from 30 patients immediately after the exposure, and the radioactivity of blood (24)Na was determined using a germanium counter. The activity of (24)Na in the blood correlated with the absorbed gamma ray doses in the irradiated field. For the same absorbed gamma ray dose in the irradiated field, the activity of blood (24)Na was higher in patients with neck or lung tumors than in patients with brain or skin tumors. The reasons for these findings are not readily apparent, but the difference in the blood volume and the ratio of bone to soft tissue in the irradiated field, as well as the dose that leaked through the clinical collimator, may be responsible.",Excluded
1240,"ATM is upregulated during the mitogenic response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients with the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) are characterized by immunodeficiency and a predisposition to develop lymphoid malignancies. The gene mutated in A-T patients, ATM, codes for a high molecular weight protein that is implicated in DNA damage recognition and cell cycle control. The ATM protein does not change in amount or cellular distribution throughout the cell cycle or in response to DNA damaging agents. Because peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are largely in a state of quiescence and can be readily stimulated to enter a proliferative phase and because A-T cells exhibit growth abnormalities and senescence, indicative of a general intracellular defect in signalling, we chose PBMCs to examine the relationship of ATM to the proliferative status of the cell. We show here that ATM protein is present at low levels in freshly isolated PBMCs and increases approximately 6-fold to 10-fold in response to a mitogenic stimulus, reaching a maximum after 3 to 4 days. A similar, but delayed response, was evident in the presence of serum only. This increase in ATM protein was accompanied by an increase in ATM kinase activity. While expression of ATM protein increased during proliferation, ATM mRNA expression was unchanged in stimulated and unstimulated cells and there was no evidence for increased ATM protein stability in the phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-treated cells. In keeping with the reduced levels of ATM in quiescent cells, the extent of radiation-induction of the p53 pathway was significantly lower than in mitogen-stimulated cells. Basal levels of p21 were elevated in quiescent cells, and the response to radiation was negligible or reduced compared with proliferating cells over a 2-hour period. Overall, the data suggest that the increase in ATM protein in proliferating cells is due to posttranscriptional regulation and points to a role for ATM in more general signalling.",Excluded
1241,"Intraspecific variation in retinal cone distribution in the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei. Studies of visual ecology have typically focused on differences among species while paying less attention to variation among populations and/or individuals. Here, we show that the relative abundance of UV, violet, yellow, and red cones varies between two populations of bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei. Animals from a spring population (high-transmission UV/blue light) have a higher frequency of UV and violet cones and a lower frequency of yellow and red cones than animals from a swamp population (low-transmission UV/blue light). Visual sensitivity does not vary significantly between the populations, but spring animals tend to be more sensitive in the UV/blue wavelengths (360-440 nm) and less sensitive in longer wavelengths (560-600 nm) than swamp animals. The results have two important implications. First, the tight conservation of functional regions of opsin genes across taxa does not imply that visual systems are constrained in their evolution; differential sensitivity can arise through differential expression of cone classes within the retina. Second, intraspecific visual signals in this species may evolve to maximize contrast between the signaler and the background (as opposed to brightness); males with blue anal fins are most abundant in swamp habitats where animals express fewer UV and violet cones.",Excluded

The former patient underwent partial resection of the glioblastoma, followed by boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and 30 Gy of fractionated X-ray radiotherapy. Eleven months after BNCT, he suffered from left hemiparesis and convulsions with enlargement of a perifocal edema. The latter patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery twice for the same tumor.

Seventeen participants took part of a 48h laboratory protocol, during which three different light settings (separated by 2 wks) were administered each morning after two 6-h sleep restriction nights: a blue monochromatic LED (light-emitting diode) light condition (BL; 100 lux at 470 nm for 20 min) starting 2 h after scheduled wake-up time, a dawn-simulating light (DsL) starting 30 min before and ending 20 min after scheduled wake-up time (polychromatic light gradually increasing from 0 to 250 lux), and a dim light (DL) condition for 2 h beginning upon scheduled wake time (<8 lux). Cognitive tasks were performed every 2 h during scheduled wakefulness, and questionnaires were administered hourly to assess subjective sleepiness, mood, and well-being. Salivary melatonin and cortisol were collected throughout scheduled wakefulness in regular intervals, and the effects on melatonin were measured after only one light pulse. Following the first SR, analysis of the time course of cognitive performance during scheduled wakefulness indicated a decrease following DL, whereas it remained stable following BL and significantly improved after DsL. Cognitive performance levels during the second day after SR were not significantly affected by the different light conditions. However, after both SR nights, mood and well-being were significantly enhanced after exposure to morning DsL compared with DL and BL. Melatonin onset occurred earlier after morning BL exposure, than after morning DsL and DL, whereas salivary cortisol levels were higher at wake-up time after DsL compared with BL and DL. Our data indicate that exposure to an artificial morning dawn simulation light improves subjective well-being, mood, and cognitive performance, as compared with DL and BL, with minimal impact on circadian phase. Thus, DsL may provide an effective strategy for enhancing cognitive performance, well-being, and mood under mild sleep restriction.",Excluded

The skin circadian clock is known to be involved in various important cellular pathways including cell cycle, nucleotide excision repair, and metabolism by regulating the expression of specific target genes known as the clock-controlled genes (CCGs). In this study, we show that Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), an essential rate-limiting protein in melanin biosynthesis, is a transcriptional target of the circadian clock. Using primary human melanocytes, human melanoma cells and mouse skin tissues, we have established transcriptional regulation of MITF by the circadian clock, which translates into rhythmic 24 hr expression of MITF mRNA and protein levels. We also show that the circadian clock protein Brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (BMAL1) is a positive regulator of MITF, which causes an increase in melanin levels. Further, we demonstrate that upon exposure to solar UV-B radiation in presence of BMAL1, there is reduced gammaH2AX and cleaved PARP level compared to BMAL1 deficient group, which contributes to enhanced cell viability and survival. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the novel regulation of MITF by BMAL1 provides better protection against solar UV-B mediated genomic instability and melanomagenesis.",Excluded
1252,"Alectinib versus crizotinib in treatment-naive anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer: CNS efficacy results from the ALEX study. Background: The phase III ALEX study in patients with treatment-naive advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutation-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) met its primary end point of improved progression-free survival (PFS) with alectinib versus crizotinib. Here, we present detailed central nervous system (CNS) efficacy data from ALEX.Patients and methods: Overall, 303 patients aged >=18 years underwent 1:1 randomization to receive twice-daily doses of alectinib 600 mg or crizotinib 250 mg. Brain imaging was conducted in all patients at baseline and every subsequent 8 weeks. End points (analyzed by subgroup: patients with/without baseline CNS metastases; patients with/without prior radiotherapy) included PFS, CNS objective response rate (ORR), and time to CNS progression.Results: In total, 122 patients had Independent Review Committee-assessed baseline CNS metastases (alectinib, n = 64; crizotinib, n = 58), 43 had measurable lesions (alectinib, n = 21; crizotinib, n = 22), and 46 had received prior radiotherapy (alectinib, n = 25; crizotinib, n = 21). Investigator-assessed PFS with alectinib was consistent between patients with baseline CNS metastases [hazard ratio (HR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.64] and those without (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33-0.80, P interaction = 0.36). Similar results were seen in patients regardless of prior radiotherapy. Time to CNS progression was significantly longer with alectinib versus crizotinib and comparable between patients with and without baseline CNS metastases (P < 0.0001). CNS ORR was 85.7% with alectinib versus 71.4% with crizotinib in patients who received prior radiotherapy and 78.6% versus 40.0%, respectively, in those who had not.Conclusion: Alectinib demonstrated superior CNS activity and significantly delayed CNS progression versus crizotinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced ALK+ NSCLC, irrespective of prior CNS disease or radiotherapy.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02075840.",Excluded
1253,"Trans-cranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (TCMRGFUS): Preliminary Italian (and world-first) experience at 1,5 tesla. Purpose:We present our preliminary results achieved with the first Italian installation of a trans-cranial MRI-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (tcMRgFUS) certified system for functional neurosurgery. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the world-first tcMRgFUS system ever installed on a 1.5T MRI unit. Technical issues faced to achieve a safe and effective treatment will be discussed focusing on MR high-resolution live imaging and thermometry sequences optimization. Method(s): Patient enrollment was based on indication for functional neurosurgery and evidence of medication-refractory disease; a detailed medical history has been collected together with a complete clinical examination and a neurophysiological assessment. Eligible patients have been screened by MDCT and MRI. TcMRgFUS treatments have been performed by a neurosurgeon with proven experience in functional neurosurgery, and an experienced neuroradiologist, optimizing treatment parameters case by case. Result(s): Although this is a preliminary experience, the clinical success of our first treatments proves that this promising new technology for non-invasive treatment of various brain disorders can be safety and effectively performed also with the most popular MRI units operating at 1.5T. Conclusion(s): TcMRgFUS treatments are currently performed in a very few centers in the world and only using 3T MRI units. This is the world-first experience of functional neurosurgery successfully performed with a tcMRgFUS installed on the most popular and affordable 1.5T MR units Direct translational impacts are expected by the use of widely installed 1.5T MRI units both on patient quality of life and on savings in health spending, with reduction in the consumption of drugs, as well as in requests for medical examinations. Being able to use a radiation-free technique like the MRI as a guide and, even further, being able to verify the clinical effectiveness of such an innovative treatment before a permanent lesion is made in the targeted area of the brain is a huge step forward for both interventional radiology and functional neurosurgery.",Excluded

1255,"Somatostatinergic modulation of firing pattern and calcium-activated potassium currents in medium spiny neostriatal neurons. Somatostatin is synthesized and released by aspiny GABAergic interneurons of the neostriatum, some of them identified as low threshold spike generating neurons (LTS-interneurons). These neurons make synaptic contacts with spiny neostriatal projection neurons. However, very few somatostatin actions on projection neurons have been described. The present work reports that somatostatin modulates the Ca(2+) activated K(+) currents (K(Ca) currents) expressed by projection cells. These actions contribute in designing the firing pattern of the spiny projection neuron; which is the output of the neostriatum. Small conductance (SK) and large conductance (BK) K(Ca) currents represent between 30% and 50% of the sustained outward current in spiny cells. Somatostatin reduces SK-type K(+) currents and at the same time enhances BK-type K(+) currents. This dual effect enhances the fast component of the after hyperpolarizing potential while reducing the slow component. Somatostatin then modifies the firing pattern of spiny neurons which changed from a tonic regular pattern to an interrupted ""stuttering""-like pattern. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tissue expression analysis of dorsal striatal somatostatinergic receptors (SSTR) mRNA revealed that all five SSTR mRNAs are present. However, single cell RT-PCR profiling suggests that the most probable receptor in charge of this modulation is the SSTR2 receptor. Interestingly, aspiny interneurons may exhibit a ""stuttering""-like firing pattern. Therefore, somatostatin actions appear to be the entrainment of projection neurons to the rhythms generated by some interneurons. Somatostatin is then capable of modifying the processing and output of the neostriatum.",Excluded

Here, we show that the Ti:Sapphire laser in a multiphoton microscope can be used to cause localized damage within unlabeled cells or tissues at greater depths than previously possible. We show that the damage is due to a multiphoton process and made wounds as small as 1 microm in diameter 20 microm from the surface. A characteristic fluorescent scar allows monitoring of the damage and identifies the wound site in later observations. We were able to lesion a single axon within a bundle of nerves, locally interrupt organelle transport within one axon, cut dendrites in a zebrafish embryo, ablate a mitotic pole in a sea urchin egg, and wound the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope in starfish oocytes. The starfish nucleus collapsed approximately 1 h after wounding, indicating that loss of compartmentation barrier makes the structure unstable; surprisingly, the oocyte still completed meiotic divisions when exposed to maturation hormone, indicating that the compartmentalization and translocation of cdk1 and its regulators is not required for this process.

All but one (chloramphenicol) of these bioactive reagents substantially retarded the recovery and increased the death rate of such ""dark"" neurons. As concerns the dehydrating drugs and ion channel modulators, these effects are considered to be consequences of the fact that relatively large volumes (more than half of the original cell volume) of cytoplasmic fluid (water molecules, inorganic ions and metabolites) leave the affected cells through passive pores within a few minutes. The effects of the mitochondrial enzyme inhibitors appear to indicate that restoration of the original cell volume (recovery) demands metabolic (enzyme-mediated) energy.

1268,"Melatonin: A Potential Anti-Oxidant Therapeutic Agent for Mitochondrial Dysfunctions and Related Disorders. Mitochondria play a central role in cellular physiology. Besides their classic function of energy metabolism, mitochondria are involved in multiple cell functions, including energy distribution through the cell, energy/heat modulation, regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium homeostasis, and control of apoptosis. Simultaneously, mitochondria are the main producer and target of ROS with the result that multiple mitochondrial diseases are related to ROS-induced mitochondrial injuries. Increased free radical generation, enhanced mitochondrial inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production, decreased respiratory complex activity, impaired electron transport system, and opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores have all been suggested as factors responsible for impaired mitochondrial function. Because of these, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and aging, are caused by ROS-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions. Melatonin, the major hormone of the pineal gland, also acts as an anti-oxidant and as a regulator of mitochondrial bioenergetic function. Melatonin is selectively taken up by mitochondrial membranes, a function not shared by other anti-oxidants, and thus has emerged as a major potential therapeutic tool for treating neurodegenerative disorders. Multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown the protective role of melatonin for preventing oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction seen in experimental models of PD, AD, and HD. With these functions in mind, this article reviews the protective role of melatonin with mechanistic insights against mitochondrial diseases and suggests new avenues for safe and effective treatment modalities against these devastating neurodegenerative diseases.

1269,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation of primary motor cortex affects mental rotation. Neuroimaging studies have shown that motor structures are activated not only during overt motor behavior but also during tasks that require no overt motor behavior, such as motor imagery and mental rotation. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the primary motor cortex is needed for mental rotation by using single- pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Single-pulse TMS was delivered to the representation of the hand in left primary motor cortex while participants performed mental rotation of pictures of hands and feet. Relative to a peripheral magnetic stimulation control condition, response times (RTs) were slower when TMS was delivered at 650 ms but not at 400 ms after stimulus onset. The magnetic stimulation effect at 650 ms was larger for hands than for feet. These findings demonstrate that (i) activation of the left primary motor cortex has a causal role in the mental rotation of pictures of hands; (ii) this role is stimulus-specific because disruption of neural activity in the hand area slowed RTs for pictures of hands more than feet; and (iii) left primary motor cortex is involved relatively late in the mental rotation process.",Excluded
1270,"Complications of gamma knife neurosurgery and their appropriate management. There are four main risks with Gamma Knife neurosurgery. Firstly, there are direct complications that would not have arisen if the patient had not undergone the specific treatment under consideration. For radiosurgery, the direct complications are radiation-induced damage to the tissues, which may be temporary or permanent. They may be expressed clinically or be clinically silent. In addition, there are complications that are specific to certain diseases and their locations, such as pituitary failure following treatment of pituitary adenomas and deafness, facial palsy, or trigeminal deficit following the treatment of vestibular schwannomas. Second, there are indirect or management-related complications arising from delayed control of the disease process, such as a re-bleed after treatment of a vascular lesion before its occlusion. Third, there is the risk of induction of neoplasia from irradiation of normal tissue or tumor. These are separate processes. An example of the first would be induction of a glioma after treatment of a vascular malformation. An example of the second would be induction of malignant change in a benign vestibular schwannoma. Finally, there is treatment failure, where tumors continue to grow after treatment or vascular malformations fail to occlude.",Excluded

The properties of hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and the effect of hypoxia on the current have been studied using whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Under voltage-clamp mode, I(h), blocked by 1 mM extracellular CsCl, was present in 75.5% of mouse DRG neurons. The distribution rate increased as the neurons become larger, 5.3%, 79.8% and 94.2% in small, medium and large neurons, respectively. Both I(h) density and the rate of I(h) activation increased in response to more hyperpolarized potential. The activation of I(h) current in larger neuron was faster than in smaller neuron, there was a significant correlation between the time constant of I(h) activation and neuron's size. However, I(h) density did not show any correlation with neuron's size. Under current-clamp mode, 'depolarizing sag' was observed in all neurons with I(h) current. The reversal potential (V(rev)) and the maximal conductance density of I(h) (G(h.max-density)) were -31.0 +/- 4.8 mV and 0.17 +/- 0.02 nS/pF, with a half-activated potential (V(0.5) = -99.4 +/- 1.1 mV) and a slope factor (kappa = -10.2 +/- 0.3 mV). There was a correlation between neuron's size and G(h.max-density) only. According to the effect of hypoxia on resting membrane potential, there were hypoxia-sensitive and hypoxia-insensitive neurons. In the hypoxia-sensitive neurons, I(h) was fully abolished by hypoxia, although the resting membrane potential was hyperpolarized. V(0.5) and V(rev) were shifted about 30 mV toward hyperpolarization, whereas G(h.max-density) and kappa were not affected by hypoxia. We suggest that the kinetics and voltage-dependent characteristics of I(h) are varied in mouse DRG neurons with different size. Hypoxia inhibits I(h) in the hypoxia-sensitive neurons by shifting its activation potential to a more hyperpolarized level.",Excluded

Using a cranial window model, we showed that anti-VEGF treatment may achieve these effects via normalizing the tumor vasculature, improving vessel perfusion, and delivery of oxygenation. It is known that oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer; therefore, we further demonstrated that combining anti-VEGF with radiation therapy can achieve a better tumor control and help lower the radiation dose and, thus, minimize radiation-related neurological toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Relapses of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) have a poor prognosis and are almost always fatal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome and toxicity of intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IOERT) in advanced and recurrent EOC.METHODS: Forty-five women with EOC were treated with IOERT. Twenty-five patients had primary disease (PD) without distant metastasis at IOERT, and 20 patients had an isolated local recurrence (ILR) after surgery. All 45 patients in this series underwent optimal cytoreductive (<= 1 cm) surgery. The whole pelvic (WP) radiotherapy was intraoperatively delivered using 12 Mev electron beam; 43 patients received 18-20 Gy and two patients received 10 Gy. Thirty-three patients received postoperateive intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy, while seven patients received intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. Five patients refused concurrent chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Tumor recurrence and metastasis were observed in 16 patients (35.6%). Of those, 14 patients (31.1%) relapsed and two patients (4.4%) had distant metastasis alone. Eight of 25 (32%) local failures were observed in the PD group, as compared to 6/20 (30%) in the ILR group (P = 0.885). Actuarial local control at five year follow-up was 31/45 (68.9%). Seventeen of the total 45 (37.8%) patients died. Nine of 25 (36%) in the PD group died, as compared to 8 of 20 (40%) in the ILR group. The 5-year OS and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 28/45 (62.2%) and 25/45 (55.6%), respectively. In the PD group, the 5-year OS and DFS rates were 16/25 (64%) and 14/25 (56%) (P > 0.05, vs. the ILR group at 12/20 and 11/20, respectively). The OS and DFS in the IOERT plus IP group were 25/33 (75.8%) and 23/33 (69.7%), respectively, which were superior to the rates achieved with IOERT plus IV chemotherapy (P < 0.05, 2/7 and 1/7, respectively). The major complication of IOERT was neuropathy. Five (11.1%) patients developed peripheral neurotoxicity.CONCLUSIONS: IOERT may be feasible and effective as a boosting technique for advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer. IOERT plus IP chemotherapy may achieve high locoregional disease control and survival benefit with a low risk of toxicity. Peripheral nerves in the IOERT field are dose-limiting structures requiring nerve protection policies or a dose compromise to ensure against severe neurological damage.",Excluded

Conclusion(s): PD patients that have undergone Raprl-DBS show an improvement on gait that also occurs after unilateral GP-DBS, which could be explained because of the bilateral connections from Raprl to PPN through fibers crossing the midline at lower midbrain. Our findings provide new insights into subthalamic connectivity that allow explaining clinical benefits obtained after Raprl-DBS.",Excluded
1277,"Shifting and scaling adaptation to dynamic stimuli in somatosensory cortex. Recent reports have shown that responses of midbrain neurons in the guinea pig rapidly shift the dynamic range of their responses to track changes in the statistics of ongoing sound-level distributions. This results in an increased coding accuracy for the most commonly occurring stimulus intensities. To investigate whether this type of adaptation might also be found in other sensory modalities, we characterized the intensity-response functions of neurons in rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to continuous sinusoidal vibration of the whiskers with amplitudes that were changed every 40 ms. Vibration amplitudes were selected randomly such that there was an 80% chance for the amplitude to be drawn from a relatively narrow 'high-probability region' (HPR). Stimulus mean and variance were then manipulated by shifting or widening the HPR. We found that rat S1 neurons adapt to shifts of the HPR mainly by shifting their thresholds, and to changes in HPR width by changing the slope of their rate-level curves. Using realistic single-neuron models, we go on to show that after-hyperpolarizing currents, such as those carried by K(Ca)(2+) channels, may be responsible for the threshold shifts, but not the slope changes.",Excluded
1278,"Radiosurgery in the treatment of brain cavernomas. Experience with 17 lesions treated in 15 patients. [French]. The aim of this study is to assess the efficiency of radiosurgery (RS) in the treatment of brain cavernomas. The series included intra-axial 17 lesions in 15 patients, 10 women and 5 men. Eleven were infratentorial lesions (brain stem and cerebellum) and 6 supratentorial (thalamus, hippocampus, brain cortex and paraventricular region). Fifteen lesions bled once or twice. Two lesions revealed by focal epilepsy displayed a rim of hemosiderin on MRI. RS was performed for all 17 lesions. The risk of morbidity was considered too high for surgery in 13 patients and 2 patients wished to be treated by RS. RS was delivered by a 6 MeV linear accelerator with a conic collimators device. Stereotactic localization and dosimetry were carried out with STP system 3.O (Fischer-Liebinger TM, Germany). Doses ranged between 16 and 23 Gy, the lower doses being delivered to brain stem lesions. All the lesions received a single fraction isocentric radiation. Lesion volumes ranged between 0.7 and 4.7 cm<sup>3</sup>. Twelve lesions disappeared on MRI, the volume reduced (50-80%) in 3 lesions, and did not change in 2 lesions. Volume reduction was significant (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). In the follow up, 4 patients experienced bleeding, 1 of them died. Edema diagnosed in 2 patients at 3 and 13 months was treated by corticosteroids. The risk of hemorrhage without treatment in this group of patients was estimated about 34.45% a year. Hemorrhage incidence observed after RS was 7.17% (significant with P < 0.01, P < 0.001). At the end of follow up, 12 patients were symptom-free, 2 had sequels from bleeding, 1 patient died. Radiosurgery is an efficient treatment of cavernomas leading to a total disappearance of 70% of the lesions and significantly reducing the risk of new hemorrhages. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

1279,"Carcinoma of the skin with perineural invasion. Purpose. To evaluate the outcome and patterns of relapse in patients treated for skin carcinoma of the head and neck with either microscopic or clinical perineural invasion. Methods and Materials. Radiotherapy alone or combined with surgery was used to treat 135 patients with microscopic or clinical evidence of perineural invasion of skin carcinoma. All patients had at least 2 years of follow-up. Results. The 5-year local control rates without salvage therapy were 87% with microscopic perineural invasion and 55% with clinical perineural invasion. Overall, 88% of the local failures occurred in patients with positive margins. Almost half of the recurrences in patients with microscopic perineural invasion were limited to the first-echelon regional nodes. However, only 1 of 11 patients with basal cell carcinoma with microscopic perineural invasion had a nodal failure. Ninety percent of recurrences in patients with clinical perineural invasion occurred at the primary site. Cranial nerve deficits rarely improved after successful treatment of the primary disease. Radiographic abnormalities remained stable 30% of the time when patients had clinical evidence of progressive disease. Conclusions. Radiotherapy in patients with skin cancer with clinical perineural invasion should include treatment of the first-echelon regional lymphatics. The risk of regional node involvement is also relatively high for patients with squamous cell carcinoma with microscopic perineural invasion. In patients with clinical perineural invasion, the poor local control rates with conventional radiotherapy suggest a need for dose escalation with or without concomitant chemotherapy. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1280,"Glycoprotein 41 Targeted Radioimmunotherapy as a Novel Treatment for NeuroHIV/AIDS. The HIV epidemic is a major global health threat. Nowadays HIV-infected individuals live much longer due to the inhibition of the viral replication by combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART). However, cART fails to eradicate the residual HIV-infected cells, therefore, virus persists and continues to cause damage both systemically and to central nervous system (CNS). HIV enters the CNS in infected monocytes shortly after peripheral exposure. The infection of CNS poses a challenge due to strict regulation of the entry of molecules into the brain by the blood brain barrier (BBB) which limits many cART regimens from reaching effective levels in the brain. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) uses antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for targeted delivery of cytocidal ionizing radiations to cells. The distinct advantages of RIT are its relative independence from the immune status of the patient and secondly, it is not subject to drug resistance mechanisms. These features are very useful in the management of HIV-infected individuals. The challenge in extending the RIT approach to the elimination of HIV in the CNS lies in the difficulty of the therapeutic molecules to penetrate through the BBB. Recently we have demonstrated that an antibody 2556 to gp41 was able to penetrate the in vitro human BBB and to kill infected cells in the brain compartment of the BBB model (McFarren et al AIDS 2016). In this study we have identified six human mAbs with higher pI (> 8.5) that recognizes a conserved region of HIV gp41. The penetration of these antibodies through in vitro human BBB model was pI dependent. We are now using these novel gp41-binding human mAbs conjugated with three different radioisotopes (<sup>213</sup>Bi, <sup>188</sup>Re or <sup>177</sup>Lu) enabling their more efficient penetration into the CNS through the intact BBB. To achieve this, monocytes are infected with HIV and then treated with radiolabelled mAbs. Finally, to validate these novel radiolabeled molecules, we will use a human in vitro BBB model to assess the ability of these mAbs to penetrate the BBB and to kill the HIV infected monocytes in the brain compartment of the BBB model. This study will provide a novel treatment option for the eradication of HIV-1 infection and will also be useful for treatment of drug-resistant HIV strains.

1281,"Pattern of retinal morphological and functional decay in a light-inducible, rhodopsin mutant mouse. Hallmarks of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a family of genetic diseases, are a typical rod-cone-degeneration with initial night blindness and loss of peripheral vision, followed by decreased daylight sight and progressive visual acuity loss up to legal blindness. Great heterogeneity in nature and function of mutated genes, variety of mutations for each of them, variability in phenotypic appearance and transmission modality contribute to make RP a still incurable disease. Translational research relies on appropriate animal models mimicking the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the human pathology. Here, we provide a systematic, morphological and functional analysis of Rho<sup>Tvrm4</sup>/Rho<sup>+</sup> rhodopsin mutant mice, originally described in 2010 and portraying several features of common forms of autosomal dominant RP caused by gain-of-function mutations. These mice undergo photoreceptor degeneration only when exposed briefly to strong, white light and allow controlled timing of induction of rod and cone death, which therefore can be elicited in adult animals, as observed in human RP. The option to control severity and retinal extent of the phenotype by regulating intensity and duration of the inducing light opens possibilities to exploit this model for multiple experimental purposes. Altogether, the unique features of this mutant make it an excellent resource for retinal degeneration research.",Excluded
1282,"Helical tomotherapy in advanced and recurrence head and neck cancer: Preliminary results. Introduction/Background/Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) by Helical Tomotherapy (HT) in patients affected by advanced and recurrence head and neck cancer. In both cases difficulties exist in treating large volumes near organs at risk (OAR) with high dose levels. Particularly, more difficulties can occur in cases of re-irradiation. HT allows this kind of treatment by using of IMRT technique with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) associated with daily IGRT. Materials and Methods/Patients and Methods: Between October 2010 and April 2011 thirteen patients (9 male and 4 female) with advanced or recurrence head and neck cancer were enrolled in our study; in particular: 3 primary cutaneous advanced carcinoma (involving orbital and/or paranasal cavities), 4 recurrences after previous radiotherapy in the same site, 7 advanced head and neck cancer. The mean age was 63.2 years. Six patients received concomitant chemotherapy platinum-based. All patients underwent fiber-optic endoscopy, CT imaging and MRI imaging for staging. All patients also underwent 18-FDG-PET-CT virtual-simulation for treatment planning. All patients received a supportive odontostomatological and nutritional protocol. The treatment volumes were: the gross tumor volume and positive nodes (as visible at imaging) irradiated with curative doses (66-70.5 Gy in 30 fractions, 2.2-2.35 Gy/die); nodal levels at higher risk irradiated with prophylactic doses (60 Gy/30 fractions); loco-regional nodes irradiated with prophylactic doses (54 Gy/30 fractions). The countered organ at risk were: brain, brainstem, chiasm, optic nerve, lens, spinal cord, parotid glands, mandible, temporal-mandibular joint. In patients previously irradiated the prior treatment planning was reviewed in order to evaluate the overlapping of the irradiated volumes. Results were evaluated in terms of acute and sub-acute toxicity and clinical outcome. Toxicity was evaluated according to RTOG-EORTC scale. Fiber-optic endoscopy was performed 1 month after the end of radiotherapy. CT, MRI and PET-CT imaging were performed 3 months after treatment. Result(s): All patients completed the treatment. One patient required interruption of treatment for 2 days. Five patients required infusion medical therapy, during radiotherapy, with corticosteroids, antibiotics, anti-fungal, analgesics and antiinflammatory drugs and parenteral nutrition. Acute skin toxicity was: G1 in 9 patients, G2 in 2 patients, G3 in 1 patient. Acute mucous toxicity was: G1 in 8 patients, G2 in 4 patients, G3 in 1 patient. For three patients re-planning during radiation treatment was necessary because of relevant tumor volume reduction. Three patients have a complete clinical response during treatment, confirmed at post-treatment imaging. Five patients have a partial clinical response > 50% at the end of RT, confirmed at post-treatment imaging. Two patients have a partial clinical response < 50%, and 2 patients a stable disease after RT, confirmed at posttreatment imaging. The last patient had no sufficient follow-up to evaluate response. Late toxicity was not evaluated because of the short follow-up. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Our initial experience shows that HT allows delivering of high radiation doses to the tumor volume with good precision resulting from to the ability to verify daily set-up patients by megavoltage cone beam CT. Dose escalation results in objective clinical responses already during radiation treatment with possibility of re-planning, allowing for adaptive radiotherapy. Relevant toxicity, particularly in patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy, requires close monitoring of patients and supportive care to allow completing treatment. Our supportive odontostomatological and nutritional protocol is useful in this regard. Our results are absolutely preliminary, PET-CT is mandatory for contouring before the treatment and during radiotherapy for re-planning and also at the of radiotherapy for quantitative response evaluation. Further follow up is necessary to evaluate long term outcome and late toxicity.",Excluded
1283,"MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Neuroendocrine surveillance and management of neurosurgical patients. Advances in the management of traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracranial tumours have led to improved survival rates and an increased focus on quality of life of survivors. Endocrine sequelae of the acute brain insult and subsequent neurosurgery, peri-operative fluid administration and/or cranial irradiation are now well described. Unrecognised acute hypopituitarism, particularly ACTH/cortisol deficiency and diabetes insipidus, can be life threatening. Although hypopituitarism may be transient, up to 30% of survivors of TBI have chronic hypopituitarism, which can diminish quality of life and hamper rehabilitation. Patients who survive SAH may also develop hypopituitarism, though it is less common than after TBI. The growth hormone axis is most frequently affected. There is also accumulating evidence that survivors of intracranial malignancy, who have required cranial irradiation, may develop hypopituitarism. The time course of the development of hormone deficits is varied, and predictors of pituitary dysfunction are unreliable. Furthermore, diagnosis of GH and ACTH deficiency require dynamic testing that can be resource intensive. Thus the surveillance and management of neuroendocrine dysfunction in neurosurgical patients poses significant logistic challenges to endocrine services. However, diagnosis and management of pituitary dysfunction can be rewarding. Appropriate hormone replacement can improve quality of life, prevent complications such as muscle atrophy, infection and osteoporosis and improve engagement with physiotherapy and rehabilitation.",Excluded
1284,"Monitoring radiation treatment effects in glioblastoma: Are changes in flair volume prognostic?. Purpose/Objective(s): Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity is believed to represent microscopic infiltration of tumor in glioblastoma (GBM), but is also affected by post-treatment changes. Numerous studies have evaluated the relationship between FLAIR volume and clinical outcomes, but results have been mixed. We sought to develop an objective measure of FLAIR volume that was independent of user input and not influenced by digital contrast adjustment. Using this automated method of image analysis, we evaluated the relationship between pre-radiation FLAIR volume and post-radiation changes in FLAIR volume in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed FLAIR imaging data from 56 consecutive GBM patients treated at a single institution between January 2012 and December 2013. An increase in FLAIR signal was defined as voxels 2 standard deviations above the median intensity value across the entire brain-extracted volume. This automated process was performed on the post-resection, pre-radiation MRI scan as well as all available post-radiation FLAIR sequences. The volume of voxels reaching this threshold was computed for all sequences. All patient charts were reviewed to compute the PFS, which was defined as any radiographic or clinical progression leading to a recommendation to change or stop treatment. Result(s): Of 56 patients, 24 (43%) were female and the median age was 60.5 years (range 16 e 85). Our analysis failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between the initial FLAIR volume and overall survival or clinically defined PFS. The change in FLAIR volume after radiation therapy as a function of time was also not related to these clinical outcome measures. The lack of a significant association between these measures was also true when using a more stringent threshold of FLAIR hyperintensity (5 standard deviations above the mean). Conclusion(s): With the assumption that FLAIR signal represents inflammatory edema caused by tumor infiltration into otherwise healthy tissue, many studies have attempted to correlate FLAIR volume with OS and PFS in the post-treatment setting. Results of these studies have varied, and the prognostic value of FLAIR volume has yet to be clearly demonstrated in glioblastoma. Using an automated and objective volumetric measure, we found no significant correlation between clinical outcomes and changes in FLAIR volume, a measure that is often used in routine MRI surveillance in the post-treatment setting. Our results suggest that gross edema volumes cannot directly predict PFS or OS.",Excluded
1285,"Vestibular adaptation to centrifugation does not transfer across planes of head rotation. Out-of-plane head movements performed during fast rotation produce non-compensatory nystagmus, sensations of illusory motion, and often motion sickness. Adaptation to this cross-coupled Coriolis stimulus has previously been demonstrated for head turns made in the yaw (transverse) plane of motion, during supine head-on-axis rotation. An open question, however, is if adaptation to head movements in one plane of motion transfers to head movements performed in a new, unpracticed plane of motion. Evidence of transfer would imply the brain builds up a generalized model of the vestibular sensory-motor system, instead of learning a variety of individual input/output relations separately. To investigate, over two days 9 subjects performed pitch head turns (sagittal plane) while rotating, before and after a series of yaw head turns while rotating. A Control Group of 10 subjects performed only the pitch movements. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and sensations of illusory motion were recorded in the dark for all movements. Upon comparing the two groups we failed to find any evidence of transfer from the yaw plane to the pitch plane, suggesting that adaptation to cross-coupled stimuli is specific to the particular plane of head movement. The findings have applications for the use of centrifugation as a possible countermeasure for long duration spaceflight. Adapting astronauts to unconstrained head movements while rotating will likely require exposure to head movements in all planes and directions. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

1286,"Predictors of individual tumor local control after stereotactic radiosurgery for non-small cell lung cancer brain metastases. Purpose: To evaluate local control rates and predictors of individual tumor local control for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Methods and Materials: Between June 1998 and May 2011, 401 brain metastases in 228 patients were treated with Gamma Knife single-fraction SRS. Local failure was defined as an increase in lesion size after SRS. Local control was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to identify an optimal cutpoint for conformality index relative to local control. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Median age was 60 years (range, 27-84 years). There were 66 cerebellar metastases (16%) and 335 supratentorial metastases (84%). The median prescription dose was 20 Gy (range, 14-24 Gy). Median overall survival from time of SRS was 12.1 months. The estimated local control at 12 months was 74%. On multivariate analysis, cerebellar location (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94, P=.009), larger tumor volume (HR 1.09, P<.001), and lower conformality (HR 0.700, P=.044) were significant independent predictors of local failure. Conformality index cutpoints of 1.4-1.9 were predictive of local control, whereas a cutpoint of 1.75 was the most predictive (P=.001). The adjusted Kaplan-Meier 1-year local control for conformality index >=1.75 was 84% versus 69% for conformality index <1.75, controlling for tumor volume and location. The 1-year adjusted local control for cerebellar lesions was 60%, compared with 77% for supratentorial lesions, controlling for tumor volume and conformality index. Conclusions: Cerebellar tumor location, lower conformality index, and larger tumor volume were significant independent predictors of local failure after SRS for brain metastases from NSCLC. These results warrant further investigation in a prospective setting. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1287,"Leptin restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a chronic unpredictable stress model of depression and reverses glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling. Stress and glucocorticoid stress hormones inhibit neurogenesis, whereas antidepressants increase neurogenesis and block stress-induced decrease in neurogenesis. Our previous studies have shown that leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone with antidepressant-like properties, promotes baseline neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. This study aimed to determine whether leptin is able to restore suppression of neurogenesis in a rat chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model of depression. Chronic treatment with leptin reversed the CUS-induced reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis and depression-like behaviors. Leptin treatment elicited a delayed long-lasting antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim behavioral despair test, and this effect was blocked by ablation of neurogenesis with X-irradiation. The functional isoform of the leptin receptor, LepRb, and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were colocalized in hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro. Leptin treatment reversed the GR agonist dexamethasone (DEX)-induced reduction of proliferation of cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from adult hippocampus. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that leptin and DEX converged on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and beta-catenin. While DEX decreased Ser9 phosphorylation and increased Tyr216 phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, leptin increased Ser9 phosphorylation and attenuated the effects of DEX at both Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation sites of GSK-3beta. Moreover, leptin increased total level and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, a primary substrate of GSK-3beta and a key regulator in controlling hippocampal neural progenitor cell proliferation, and reversed the inhibitory effects of DEX on beta-catenin. Taken together, our results suggest that adult neurogenesis is involved in the delayed long-lasting antidepressant-like behavioral effects of leptin, and leptin treatment counteracts chronic stress and glucocorticoid-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis via activating the GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway.",Excluded

The energy storage and the molecular rearrangements due to the primary photochemical event in rhodopsin are investigated by using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics hybrid methods in conjunction with high-resolution structural data of bovine visual rhodopsin. The analysis of the reactant and product molecular structures reveals the energy storage mechanism as determined by the detailed molecular rearrangements of the retinyl chromophore, including rotation of the (C11-C12) dihedral angle from -11 degrees in the 11-cis isomer to -161 degrees in the all-trans product, where the preferential sense of rotation is determined by the steric interactions between Ala-117 and the polyene chain at the C13 position, torsion of the polyene chain due to steric constraints in the binding pocket, and stretching of the salt bridge between the protonated Schiff base and the Glu-113 counterion by reorientation of the polarized bonds that localize the net positive charge at the Schiff-base linkage.

All recurrences confined to the brain were found within 4 cm of the enhancing tumor as defined by the preoperative computerized tomography scan. Recurrences outside the boost were more common with inadequate boost margins, small boost volumes, temporal lobe tumors, and homolateral wedge pair technique.

1291,"Pre-clinical implementation of a small animal image-guided irradiator. Purpose/Objective: Poor precision and large field sizes used in conventional pre-clinical experiments are stumbling blocks for a fair comparison to clinical practice, where advanced RT techniques are commonly used. In addition the open problems in radiation oncology and radiobiology and the large number of possible interactions of targeted drugs in specific treatments cannot rely on clinical trials alone and emphasize the need of pre-clinical radiation research. In recent years several solutions have been proposed and here we present the implementation of a small animal IGRT (muIGRT) system (XRAD 225Cx, Precision X-Ray Inc., USA). Material(s) and Method(s): The system is designed to be able to reproduce the clinical IGRT practice and equipped with a kV x-rays source (20-225 kVp), a computer controlled couch and a high resolution a-Si detector (XRD 0820 AN, Perkin Elmer, USA) with a CsI scintillator, 200 mum pixel pitch and 1024x1024 pixels. It is designed to image (CBCT) the subject, target the area to be irradiated, position this area in the irradiation center and treat with field size down to 1 mm from different angles. This gives the possibility to perform fractionated therapy, study partial volume and dose effects and normal tissue toxicity. Result(s): Dosimetric and geometric commissioning has shown the calibrated system delivers doses (with reproducibility sigma=0.14, 0.14, 0.06 mm for LR, SI and AP respectively) in small fields (2.5 Gy/min for 5 mm field size) with 0.1 mm in-vivo targeting accuracy. The efficacy of fractionated muIGRT (4x5 Gy, 5 mm field) has been shown on various stereotactic intracranial tumour bearing mouse models (xenograft and spontaneous) where muIGRT allows local delivery of dose higher than previously used. Here the inter- and intrafraction movement has been assessed, by using image registration, to be 1.2 mm and below 0.1 mm RMS, respectively (under isoflurane anaesthesia). The additional use of multi-modality image registration (MRI to CBCT) helps improving the tumour localization of 0.3 mm (the tumour injection bore-hole used as landmark in CBCT already decreases the localization uncertainty). Normal tissue toxicity studies have been carried on for partial volume irradiation of the heart. gammaH2Ax staining of heart tissue radiation damage proved that it is feasible to accurately irradiate either the apex or the base of the heart by using image-guidance and a field size of 2.5 mm. It has been shown that left lung irradiation can be minimized while the right lung can be spared. (Figure presented). Conclusion(s): In conclusion we showed the calibrated system is capable of delivering reproducible treatments in pre-clinically convenient delivery time. We reported the implementation of a preclinical muIGRT system and showed feasible pre-clinical fractionated therapy (~5 minute per subject) in stereotactic intracranial muRT. Furthermore we applied those results to show how the system can be used for precise partial volume irradiation.",Excluded
1292,"Role for ATM in DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1. The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia is characterized by immunodeficiency, progressive cerebellar ataxia, radiosensitivity, cell cycle checkpoint defects, and cancer predisposition. The gene product [ataxia-telangiectasia mutation (ATM)] mutated in this syndrome is a component of the DNA damage detection pathway. Loss of ATM function in human and mouse cells causes defects in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control and, not surprisingly, humans and mice with compromised ATM function are prone to cancers. An excess of breast cancer in the relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia patients has also been reported by epidemiological studies. Predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers is also observed in women with germline mutations in BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene. BRCA1 is a nuclear protein with a cell cycle-regulated expression pattern and is hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA-damaging agents. Here we show that rapid ionizing radiation-induced in vivo phosphorylation of BRCA1 requires the presence of functional ATM protein. Furthermore, we show that ATM interacts with BRCA1, and this association is enhanced by radiation. We also demonstrate that BRCA1 is a substrate of ATM kinase in vitro and in vivo. Using phospho-specific antibodies against serines 1387, 1423, and 1457 of BRCA1, we demonstrate radiation-induced, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA1 at these sites. These findings show that BRCA1 is regulated by an ATM-dependent mechanism as a part of the cellular response to DNA damage. This interaction between ATM and BRCA1 argues in favor of the involvement of particular aspects of ATM function in breast cancer predisposition.",Excluded

Background: Both Gamma-Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and BRAF-inhibitors (BRAF-I) have been shown to be useful in melanoma patients with brain metastases (BM), thus suggesting that it could be interesting to combine their respective advantages. However cases of radiosensitization following conventional radiation therapy in BRAF-I treated patients have raised serious concerns about the real feasibility and risk/benefit ratio of this combination. Method(s): Blind review by 2 independent observers of brain MRI follow-up pictures and survival assessment in all patients who had been treated by GKRS and BRAF-I at a single institution. Result(s): Among53 GKRS performed in 30 patients who ever received BRAF-I and GKRS, 33 GKRS were performed in 24 patients while under BRAF-I treatment, from which only 4 with an interruption of BRAF-I. The 20 other GKRS were performed in 15 patients (including 9 of the 24) before initiation of BRAF-I treatment. Out of the 263 BM treated, only 3 edemas and 3 hemorrhages were detected within 2 months after GKRS and 4 edemas and 7 hemorrhages were detected later. No case of BM radiation necrosis and no scalp radiation dermatitis occurred. Neither the MRI features nor the incidence of the rare adverse events were deemed unexpected in such a population of melanoma BM. Median survival from first GKRS and first dose of BRAF-I was 24.7, and 48.8 weeks, respectively. Conclusion(s): This series does not show immediate radiotoxicity nor radiation-recall, in melanoma patients with BRAF-I whose BM are treated by GKRS. Interrupting BRAF-I for stereotactic radiosurgery of BM seems useless, although it is still advised for other radiation therapies. Overall very favorable survival figures suggest to test the potential benefit of combining stereotactic radiosurgery and BRAF-I.",Excluded

In pts who initially had a single BM, median OS and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 14.46 months, 66.7% and 43.4%, respectively; in pts with 2-3 BMs: 8.85 months, 46.4% and 31%, respectively; in pts with >3 BMs: 7.25 months, 37.2% and 11.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis for OS<sub>GK1</sub> confirmed that IT and TT were significantly and highly protective. Best OS<sub>GK1</sub> was observed in BRAF-wild-type pts receiving anti-PD1 or in BRAF-mutated pts receiving BRAF-inhibitors and anti-PD1 (12.26 and 14.82 months, respectively).CONCLUSION: In real-life MM pts with BMs, a strategy aiming at controlling BM with GK together with TT and/or TT seems to achieve unprecedented survival rates.",Excluded

Grasshopper-embryo neuroblasts have no spontaneous chromosome breakage; therefore they permit easy detection of agents that break chromosomes. An X-ray exposure of 1 R induces in them a detectable number of chromosome fragments. The dose-response of acentric fragment frequency fits a linear model between 0 and 128 R. Thus another cell type is added to those previously demonstrated to have no threshold dose for the induction of chromosome or gene mutations.",Excluded

(3) Quality/quantity of the sample. In rare cases even when the surgical sample is achieved it could be impossible to reach a histological confirmation, for example due to the small amount of tissue obtained. The lack of histology leads to suboptimal therapy, incorrect prognosis, and misinterpretation of clinical trials and furthermore undermines the possibility to perform most radiation and chemotherapy protocols.

The aim of this study was to examine the in vitro capacity of cyclodextrins to interfere on the beta-amyloid fibril formation; then, mucoadhesive microspheres containing cyclodextrins were prepared and characterised as nasal delivery system for brain targeting. Eight batches of microspheres containing chitosan or alginate loaded with beta-cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in two different cyclodextrin to polymer ratios were produced by spray drying. The results show that none of the tested CDs has direct cellular toxicity and they protect the cell viability from beta-peptide. The microspheres prepared are characterised by small particle sizes, ability to absorb water and to delay the in vitro dissolution rate of the CDs; good ex vivo mucoadhesive properties of the formulations are assessed. The microsphere properties are influenced by the kind of polymer, of cyclodextrin and by cyclodextrin to polymer ratio used. In particular, the alginate formulation containing the higher cyclodextrin content shows the best performance.",Excluded
1301,"Alopecia after prophylactic cranial irradiation. [Polish]. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is currently widely used in the treatment of patients with lung cancer, but despite that the data on alopecia after this type of treatment are limited. Aim. The aim of the study was to identify factors influencing the duration of alopecia after prophylactic cranial irradiation. Material and methods. Two groups of patients were analyzed: group I - 34 patients radically treated fornon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and group II - 18 patients undergoing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In group I 12 patients were treated with radiotherapy only, the remaining patients were treated with neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin + vinorelbin: PN or cisplatin + gemcitabin: PG) in 2 to 6 cycles. PCI was administered during the last tree weeks of thoracic irradiation or >=2 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy and consisted of 15 fractions of 2 Gy per day (30 Gy), 5 days per week. Patients from group II received 25 Gy in 10 fractions starting from the second week of thoracic irradiation; chemotherapy (cisplatin + vepesid: PE every 21 days) started concurrently with thoracic irradiation. Results. Alopecia occurred in all patients treated with PCI; hair loss began 2-3 weeks after the initiation of therapy. In group I full re-growth of hair occurred in 33 patients, one patient died during treatment, before hair re-growth had the chance to take place. Time to re-growth (TRG) was 1.5-6 months, median 2.5 months. In this group we observed a trend towards longer re-growths in patients who had received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.07). In group II hair re-growths occurred between 5 and 12 months after the completion of treatment, with median time of 10 months, and was significantly longer than in group I. Conclusion. The results suggest that the most important factor for TRG is the type and the number of chemotherapy cycles.",Excluded
1303,"Radiosurgery for brain metastases and cerebral edema. The objective of this study was to assess reduction in cerebral edema following linear accelerator radiosurgery (LINAC) as first line therapy for brain metastasis. We reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent LINAC radiosurgery for brain metastasis at our institution during 2010-2012, and who had not previously undergone either surgery or whole brain radiotherapy. Data were analyzed for 55 brain metastases from 46 patients (24 males), mean age 59.9 years. During the 2 months following LINAC radiosurgery, the mean steroid dose decreased from 4.8 to 2.6 mg/day, the mean metastasis volume decreased from 3.79+/-4.12 cc to 2.8+/-4.48 cc (p=0.001), and the mean edema volume decreased from 16.91+/-30.15 cc to 12.85+/-24.47 cc (p=0.23). The 17 patients with reductions of more than 50% in brain edema volume had single metastases. Edema volume in the nine patients with two brain metastases remained stable in five patients (volume change <10%, 0-2 cc) and increased in four patients (by >10%, 2-14 cc). In a subanalysis of eight metastases with baseline edema volume greater than 40 cc, edema volume decreased from 77.27+/-37.21 cc to 24.84+/-35.6 cc (p=0.034). Reductions in brain edema were greater in metastases for which non-small-cell lung carcinoma and breast cancers were the primary diseases. Overall, symptoms improved in most patients. No patients who were without symptoms or who had no signs of increased intracranial pressure at baseline developed signs of intracranial pressure following LINAC radiosurgery. In this series, LINAC stereotactic radiosurgery for metastatic brain lesions resulted in early reduction in brain edema volume in single metastasis patients and those with large edema volumes, and reduced the need for steroids.",Excluded

Guidelines based on dosimetric data exist regarding tolerable doses to pacemakers. Little is known about the effects of radiation on implantable drug delivery systems (IDDS). The objective of our study is to evaluate the safety of radiation treatment delivered to patients with IDDS.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated patients who received external beam radiation therapy in our department after implantation of an IDDS between January 1, 2000 and November 30, 2011. Information was collected on IDDS function, treatment goals, treatment fields, prescribed doses, treatment energies, and cumulative radiation doses to the pump and the catheter.RESULTS: A total of 39 patients received 60 separate courses of radiation therapy, of which 12 patients received radiation with either the pump or the catheter in the field. The remaining patients received scatter radiation only. The goal of radiation was palliative in all but one of the patients. Cumulative pump doses ranged from 5 to 36 Gy, and catheter doses ranged from 15 to 45 Gy. Beam energies ranged from 6 to 18 MV photons. All devices were checked after the completion of radiotherapy with a median follow-up of 4.5 months, and all were found to be in good working condition.CONCLUSIONS: IDDS failures related to external beam radiation therapy seem to represent a rare occurrence. While we do not see reason to limit radiotherapy in patients with IDDS, we recommend device check after the completion of radiotherapy as well as if the patient has an increase in pain or analgesic requirement.",Excluded
1306,"Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and structural chromosome aberration in mutagenicity testing. Data from previous studies published on the induction by mutagens of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and structural chromosome damage were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. Although a good correlation between the incidence of both cytogenetic phenomena has been pointed out in many previous publications, about 30% of the agents for which comparable data were available yielded non-corresponding qualitative results concerning both indicator effects. However, even in groups with good qualitative agreement distinct quantitative differences indicated different molecular mechanisms of the formation of SCEs and breaks. Additional information supporting the importance of these differences for the validity of both indicator systems has been derived from the results obtained using strong clastogens exhibiting a low or no SCE-inducing activity and vice versa, from special observations on chromosomal breakage syndromes, and from studies on the action of known co- and anti-clastogens on SCE-induction by chemical mutagens. As a result, it has been suggested that the SCE-technique should be considered as a valuable additional method for cytogenetic mutagenicity testing, which, however, is not adequate to replace the classical methods of analysis of structural chromosome damage.

Although interest in descending modulation of spinal cord function dates back to the time of Sherrington, the modern era began in the late 1960s when it was shown that focal electrical stimulation in the midbrain of the rat produced analgesia sufficient to permit surgery. From this report evolved the concept of endogenous systems of pain modulation. Initial interest focused on descending inhibition of spinal nociceptive processing, but we now know that descending modulation of spinal nociceptive processing can be either inhibitory or facilitatory. As our understanding of descending facilitatory, or pro-nociceptive influences grows, so too has our appreciation of its potential importance. Accumulating evidence suggests that descending facilitatory influences may contribute to the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia and thus contribute to chronic pain states.

1308,"Zebrafish as a ""biosensor""? Effects of ionizing radiation and amifostine on embryonic viability and development. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a popular vertebrate model system for cancer and treatment-related research. Benefits include ease of care, rapid development, optical clarity of embryos, which allows visualization of major organ systems, and opportunities for genetic manipulation. However, specific parameters of radiation sensitivity have not been systematically documented. We investigated the effects of radiation and a radiomodifier on zebrafish viability and embryonic development. Embryos were exposed to gamma-radiation (5, 10, or 20 Gy) at sequential times postfertilization and serially assessed for viability and morphologic abnormalities. As expected, lethality and morphologic perturbations were more pronounced earlier in embryogenesis and with higher radiation doses and were partially reversed by amifostine. The effects of radiation and concurrent treatment with amifostine on the developmental organization of the eye and brain were striking. Radiation resulted in hypocellularity and disorganization of the cellular layers of the retina, effects partially reversed by amifostine, as well as lens opacification. Radiation strikingly reduced the volume of brain, but the volume loss was substantially blocked by amifostine. Increased terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling signal was noted in both the irradiated eye and brain, but reduced by amifostine. Finally, irradiating embryos resulted in caspase activation detectable in 96-well microplates, which was proportional to the number of embryos and radiation dose; the degree of activation was markedly reduced by amifostine. These results together suggest the power and versatility of the zebrafish in assessing the effects of radiation and radiomodifiers on organ and tissue development.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was carried out in order to analyze the prevalence of late rectal and anal symptoms after conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer and to assess their association with quality of life.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-hundred and forty nine patients were interviewed at 24-111 months after definitive conformal radiation therapy of localized prostate cancer with a median dose of 70 Gy. Rectal symptoms and fecal incontinence were evaluated with standardized questionnaires. Quality of life was assessed with the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 and the prostate cancer module PR25.RESULTS: Rectal symptoms were mostly intermittent. Daily symptoms occurred in < or =5% of the patients. Incontinence was mostly mild with only 3% of the patients reporting daily incontinence episodes. Quality of life was comparable to that of the male German general population except that cognitive functioning and diarrhea were worse in the study population and pain was worse in the reference population. Global quality of life was associated with fecal incontinence, fecal urge, tenesmus, therapy for rectal symptoms and hormonal therapy for biochemical/clinical recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: Rectal symptoms and fecal incontinence after conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer are mostly intermittent. Fecal incontinence, fecal urge and tenesmus are associated with lower global quality of life levels.",Excluded
1311,"Substantial radiation exposure for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Increasing attention is being paid to the cancer risk conferred by imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT). Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) often are critically ill and require numerous imaging studies. A nonradiating diagnostic modality, transcranial Doppler (TCD), effectively screens for cerebral vasospasm. But when TCD is not available, CT angiography or conventional angiography may be ordered, increasing a patient's total radiation dose. This study investigated the total amount of radiation to which patients with SAH are exposed, and whether that amount was decreased by the availability of TCD. Patients with nontraumatic SAH who were admitted to an intensive care unit within 48 hours of symptom onset and who survived and remained hospitalized for at least 7 days were eligible. TCD was available for one group (TCD group) but not for the other group (no-TCD group). The total radiation dose for each patient was tallied. There were no differences in demographic variables or significant difference in radiation exposure between the 2 groups. Average total radiation exposure was 82.03 mSv in the TCD group and 89.79 mSv in the no-TCD group (P=.60). Head imaging accounted for 97.2% of the total radiation exposure in the TCD group and 90% of that in the no-TCD group. Patients with SAH are exposed to a substantial amount of radiation, almost all of which is centered on the head. Using Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII cancer risk estimates, the average lifetime attributable risk from SAH management was approximately 1 in 125.

Background: Since imaging evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) or lumbar disc herniations (LDH) may not be associated with symptoms, classification criteria based upon patient symptoms and physical examination findings are required. This study sought to develop a set of criteria identifying patients with neurogenic claudication (NC) caused by LSS and patient with radicular pain (RP) caused by LDH Results concerning NC caused by LSS are reported. Methods Phase 1: 17 spine specialists from 8 countries participated in a Delphi process, using an internet program, to rank symptoms and signs which suggest LSS as the cause of NC or DH as the cause of RP. Phase 2: 18 different spine specialists (surgeons and nonsurgeons) recruited patients during office visits and classify them with a high degree of confidence as having with either: 1) NC caused by LSS 2) RP caused by LDH or 3) non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) with non-specific leg pain radiation. Patients completed survey items and specialists documented examination signs. Signs and symptoms present in >=10 patients were analyzed by using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Patients with NC caused by LSS or NSLBP served as controls. Items with p <0.1 in univariate analysis were entered in the multivariate analysis. A score to predict NC caused by LSS was developed based on the coefficient of the GEE, and used to obtain a ROC curve and the associated area under the curve (AUC). Result(s): A list of 46 clinical signs and 28 patient-reported symptoms were selected by the group of spine specialists during the 1st phase. For the 2nd phase, 209 patients with high confidence in the diagnosis were included 63 NC caused by LSS, 89 RP caused by DH, and 57 NSLBP with non-specific leg pain radiation. Items which predicted NC with a p-value <0.1 included age >60, bilateral leg pain, leg pain relieved by sitting, leg pain decreased by leaning or flexing, positive30 seconds extension test, negative straight leg raise test. The score had an AUC of 0.91, and the cutoff to obtain a specificity of 92.1% resulted in a sensitivity of 80.0%. Conclusion(s): An international collaboration of surgeon and nonsurgeon spine specialists produced a set of diagnostic criteria with high specificity and sensitivity for identifying patients with NC caused by LSS. Using this set could improve the quality of basic science and clinical research in this field by improving homogeneity within groups of patients.",Excluded
1315,"Limitations of analytical dose calculations for small field proton radiosurgery. The purpose of the work was to evaluate the dosimetric uncertainties of an analytical dose calculation engine and the impact on treatment plans using small fields in intracranial proton stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS) for a gantry based double scattering system. 50 patients were evaluated including 10 patients for each of 5 diagnostic indications of: arteriovenous malformation (AVM), acoustic neuroma (AN), meningioma (MGM), metastasis (METS), and pituitary adenoma (PIT). Treatment plans followed standard prescription and optimization procedures for PSRS. We performed comparisons between delivered dose distributions, determined by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and those calculated with the analytical dose calculation algorithm (ADC) used in our current treatment planning system in terms of dose volume histogram parameters and beam range distributions. Results show that the difference in the dose to 95% of the target (D95) is within 6% when applying measured field size output corrections for AN, MGM, and PIT. However, for AVM and METS, the differences can be as great as 10% and 12%, respectively. Normalizing the MC dose to the ADC dose based on the dose of voxels in a central area of the target reduces the difference of the D95 to within 6% for all sites. The generally applied margin to cover uncertainties in range (3.5% of the prescribed range + 1 mm) is not sufficient to cover the range uncertainty for ADC in all cases, especially for patients with high tissue heterogeneity. The root mean square of the R90 difference, the difference in the position of distal falloff to 90% of the prescribed dose, is affected by several factors, especially the patient geometry heterogeneity, modulation and field diameter. In conclusion, implementation of Monte Carlo dose calculation techniques into the clinic can reduce the uncertainty of the target dose for proton stereotactic radiosurgery. If MC is not available for treatment planning, using MC dose distributions to adjust the delivered doses level can also reduce uncertainties below 3% for mean target dose and 6% for the D95.",Excluded

The information available at present clearly indicates that asymmetry exists from the level of elementary particles to the human cerebral cortex, the latest stage of evolution. Cerebral lateralization is one of the well-known asymmetries. This paper summarizes the data published in the past decades on the asymmetry of the neuroendocrine system. The information on the sided-differences between the gonads, adrenals, and thyroid lobes and that on the lateralization of hypothalamic, limbic, and other brain structures participating in the control of the endocrine glands as well as relevant clinical observations are reviewed here. The innervation of the peripheral endocrine glands is also briefly summarized because the afferent and efferent fibers of these glands may represent one part of the pathway involved in neuroendocrine asymmetry. The data reviewed clearly indicate that some kind of asymmetry (morphological, biochemical, physiological, pathological) is evident at different levels of the neuroendocrine system (at limbic, hypothalamic, peripheral endocrine glands and their innervation) and there are species, sex, and age differences. Most of the information accumulated deals with the CNS-gonadal system. A majority of the observations suggest that in both male and female rats there is a predominance of the right half of brain structures controlling gonadal function. The asymmetry, however, is not restricted to CNS structures: it also exists at the level of the gonads, including their innervation. It appears that the characteristic pattern of the CNS-gonadal system becomes fixed only after sexual maturation. Very few reports are available suggesting some kind of asymmetry of the CNS-adrenal cortex and the CNS-thyroid system. There are convincing findings consistent with the view that in addition to the hypothalamo-adenohypophyseal system acting via the general circulation on the peripheral endocrine glands, there is also a pure neural link between the CNS and the gonads, the CNS and the adrenal gland, and also between the CNS and the thyroid. This link contains afferent and efferent pathways and is able to modulate the functional activity or the responsiveness of the gland. It may also serve as a neural reflex arc. It is assumed that the neuroendocrine asymmetry expresses itself through (i) hypophysiotrophic neurohormones and hormones of the peripheral endocrine glands, (ii) neural pathways, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). The authors hope that this publication, in addition to providing an overview, will also stimulate research, both basic and clinical, in this exciting area of neuroendocrinology.

The regulated expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) genes was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 29 noninstitutionalized Down syndrome individuals and compared to that of 32 normal donors. Culture conditions were chosen that measure the transient, phytohemagglutinin-induced expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA, as well as the intactness of post-transcriptional and suppressor T cell-dependent mechanisms that control this expression. The latter was achieved by analyzing, respectively, the superinduction of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA occurring upon culture with cycloheximide or after low-dose gamma-irradiation. A convenient, sensitive, and quantitative assay for specific mRNA was devised, suitable for measuring mRNA levels expressed in cells from 1 ml of peripheral blood. Analysis of individuals with Down syndrome revealed a pronounced decrease in inducibility of the IL-2 gene. By contrast, induction of IFN-gamma mRNA was as vigorous as that observed for normal donors. In cells from trisomic subjects, superinduction of IFN-gamma mRNA by cycloheximide was at least as extensive as for normal donors, while in the case of IL-2 mRNA, it was weaker. These abnormal patterns of IL-2 gene expression were seen irrespective of age.

1325,"Targeting glioma stem cells with Car-T immunotherapy in xenograft animal models. Recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors often arise from glioma-initiating cells or glioma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are usually resistant to the standard therapeutic regiment of radiation and chemotherapy and hence have been an attractive target for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies to treating recurrent GBMs. Chimeric antigen receptor expressing engineered T (CAR-T) cells are redirected to detect and destroy rare tumor cells that express specific tumor antigens. CAR-T cells have been successful in treating hematological cancers, and moderately effective in remission of primary GBM tumors, but not yet been successful in the immunotherapeutic targeting of GSCs or recurrent GBMs. In this study, we have treated two patient-derived GSCs and tumor cell line derived neurospheres, as well as GSC/neurosphere-derived secondary tumor cells with CAR-T cells that specifically target IL13Ralpha2 tumor antigens on GBMs. These GSCs and neurospheres were resistant to radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy but were successful in activating antigen-specific CAR-T cells- as observed by increased proliferation as well as secretion of cytokines. In vitro co-culture of CAR-T cells with GSCs, neurospheres, and secondary tumors resulted in the effective cytotoxic killing of tumor cells. In experimental animals bearing xenograft implantation of GSCs or redefined secondary tumor cells, tumors went into remission when treated with CAR-T cells, in comparison to treatment with T cells that did not express specific CAR molecule. Together, we conclude that CAR-T cell immunotherapy can be an effective approach to targeting GSCs and treating secondary or recurrent GBM tumors.",Excluded
1326,"Influence of rotational setup errors on dose in target and organs at risk in cranial radiotherapy. Purpose or Objective: The aim of this study is to detect dose aberrations in cranial radiation therapy in the target volume and adjacent organs at risk (OARs) caused by insufficient rotational setup correction. 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) fusions were considered as the gold standard and compared to 4 DOF and 3 DOF registrations. Material(s) and Method(s): Setup errors of 12 patients with cranial lesions undergoing radiotherapy and positioned with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were analyzed. The PTVs of the included patients were large and irregularly shaped and located near or overlapping cranial OARs such as brainstem, chiasm, optical nerves or lenses. A registration between planning CT and the first CBCT of the treatment course was performed using 6 DOF, 4 DOF and 3 DOF. Differences between the three registrations were implemented and the planning CT and associated structure set shifted and warped accordingly. To detect the DOF with the largest influence on the delivered dose a rotational error of 2degree, 3degree and 4degree was simulated in one rotational dimension at a time. Using the original parameters, the treatment plan was copied and recalculated to the warped image set. Dmax and Dmean of the cranial OARs and D98 and D2 for the respective CTV and PTV were analyzed. Result(s): Differences between 6 DOF and 4 or 3 DOF fusion ranged between -1.4degree and 2degree in pitch direction, -2.5degree to 2degree in yaw, and -4.4degree to 4.2degree in roll direction. Resulting median D98 in the PTV decreased by 0.7 Gy using only 3 DOF and increased by 0.08 Gy if 4 DOF were included. Maximum dose reduction of the PTV D98 was 2.96 Gy using 3 DOF and 0.39 Gy using 4 DOF. CTV dose decreased by 0.68 using only 3 DOF and by 0.03 Gy using 4 DOF. Resulting median dose effects in the OARs are displayed in Figure 1, with largest effects of additional 0.2 and 0.8 Gy for the left and right lenses, respectively. Doses for individual patients varied up to additional 6 Gy in the lenses and 3 Gy in the optic nerves.

Pitch and roll setup errors had larger effects on the OARs compared to yaw setup deviations, as demonstrated in Figure 2. 2degree roll setup errors caused more than 5 Gy dose effect on the ipsilateral optical nerve and chiasm, followed by 2degree pitch errors resulting in over 3 Gy additional dose. The simulated 2degree yaw error had an effect of under 1 Gy on dose delivery. [Figure Presented] [Figure Presented] Conclusion(s): For cases involving higher dose effects on the evaluated structures, 4DOF registration improved plan conformity compared to 3DOF. Clinically relevant dose deviations in the CTV were not found in this patient collective. While mean dose delivery to OARs increased only slightly, up to 6 Gy in additional dose occurred for individual patient cases in this collective because of rotational errors. Safety margins for OARs could be a solution to this matter. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded
1327,"Relationship between acoustic pressure used for BBB disruption and amount of MRI contrast agent delivered to the brain. Objectives: The acoustic intensity needs to be very well known to efficiently open the Blood-brain Barrier (BBB) since it is mainly ruled by the mechanical index [1]. Previous studies have shown that a narrow range of peak negative pressure (PNP) is acceptable, corresponding to sufficient stable cavitation of injected microbubbles without reaching inertial cavitation responsible for irreversible damages. Within this range, only few data are available about how the pressure affects the strength of BBB disruption that is to say the amount of delivered drugs. We propose two new methods to evidence the opening threshold in vivo and measure this relationship after a MRI controlled protocol of the BBB opening: 1) Several different pressures are used at several brain locations during the same BBB opening session 2) A single point focal opening is performed and the brain uptake of contrast agent is correlated in each voxel with the pressure estimated from a MR-acoustic radiation force image [2]. Methods We use our previously introduced motorized MR-compatible FUS sys-tem [3] (Image Guided Therapy, France). An 8 channel annular array transducer operating at 1.5MHz (Imasonic, France) was calibrated in a water tank and acoustic transmission factors through rat skulls were measured in another study. This ability to shrewdly control the pressure we deliver in vivo in the brain is crucial for the two proposed methods. Fisher F344 rats (n=5, body weight=220g) were shaved and installed in the MRI bed of a 7T MRI scanner (Bruker) under isoflurane anesthesia. The transducer was coupled to the head with echographic gel. In a first experiment, after intravenous injection of microbubbles (Sonovue), a square trajectory was played with the transducer continuously shooting. 4 different pressures (0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 MPa) were applied on the 4 sides of the square. The transducer was moving at 10 mm/s, the size of the square was 5 mm and the trajectory was played 60 times. Then a 200muL Gadolinium based MRI contrast agent (Dotarem, Guerbet, France) was intravenously injected, at different time after the opening (10 minutes, 4 hours and 24 hours), and its uptake into the brain was quantitatively measured thank to T<inf>1</inf> maps. In a second experiment, the BBB was focally open with 0.6 MPa peak negative pressure at focus. Before the opening session, an Acoustic Radiation Force Image was acquired in order to estimate in vivo the pressure applied in each voxel during the BBB opening. After the opening, Dotarem was intravenously injected and the contrast agent concentration was measured in each voxel by acquiring T<inf>1</inf> maps [4]. The concentration in each voxel is then correlated to the pressure which has been used in this voxel to open the BBB. Results The first experiment with the square trajectory gives a rough estimation of the pressure threshold. Indeed it appears clearly (see Fig. 130) that the BBB is not open on the 0.25 and 0.35 MPa sides while it is open on the 0.45 and 0.55 MPa sides. The acoustic threshold must be between 0.35 and 0.45 MPa. With the second injection, we also found that the BBB was already close as soon as 4 hours after the opening even for the 0.55 MPa region. The second experiment gives a more accurate estimation of the pressure threshold. By plotting the concentrations in contrast agent in the voxel versus the pressure used in these voxel to open the BBB (see Fig. 131), two trends are observables. In a first pressure range, from 0 to 0.4 MPa, the pressure is not sufficient to open the BBB so the concentration is not significant. In a higher pressure range, from 0.4 MPa to 0.6MPa, the pressure is sufficient to open the BBB and the concentration increases as the pressure increases in a roughly linear way. With this experiment the found pressure threshold is about 0.4 MPa. A third way of determining the opening threshold is to study the width of the opening on the sides [LB1] of the square of the first ex-periment. Indeed it is possible to plot the concentration profile across the lines of the opening and t compare it to the Gaussian profile of the pressure which has been studied in water tank. It appeared that the width where the BBB is open matches with the width on the Gaussian profile where the pressure is higher than 0.4 MPa. Conclusions The two different methods proposed for the study of the dependency of drug uptake after BBB disruption with acoustic pressure give consistent results. We find an acoustic pressure threshold for the BBB opening of 0.4 MPa, for a 1.5 MHz working frequency. This result is in good accordance with the literature [5]. By acquiring T2 weighted images after those experiments, we are confident we caused no damages up to 0.6 MPa. This pressure is close to the one for which adverse effects started to appear in our previous studies thought. As a consequence, the pressure window for a safe and efficient BBB opening is quite narrow which highlights that the pressure in vivo has to be very well controlled. [LB1] Above the opening threshold, the relationship between drug uptake and acoustic pressure is linear. The knowledge of this relationship is key in order to predict drug pharmacokinetics after BBB disruption.",Excluded
1328,"Primary CNS lymphoma. Primary CNS lymphoma, an uncommon form of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, has increased in incidence and occurs in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Primary CNS lymphoma in immunocompetent patients is associated with unique diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic issues and the management of this malignancy is different from other forms of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Characteristic imaging features should lead to suspicion of the diagnosis, avoidance of corticosteroids (if possible) and early neurosurgical consultation for stereotactic biopsy. Since primary CNS lymphoma may involve the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and eyes, diagnostic evaluation should include assessment of all of these regions as well as screening for the possibility of occult systemic disease. Resection provides no therapeutic benefit and should be reserved for the rare patient with neurological deterioration due to brain herniation. Whole-brain radiation therapy alone is insufficient for durable tumor control and is associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity in patients over 60 years of age. Neurotoxicity is typically associated with significant cognitive, motor and autonomic dysfunction and has a negative impact on quality of life. Chemotherapy and whole-brain radiation therapy together improve tumor response rates and survival compared with whole-brain radiation therapy alone. Methotrexate-based multiagent chemotherapy without whole-brain radiation therapy is associated with similar tumor response rates and survival compared with regimens that include whole-brain radiation therapy, although controlled trials have not been performed. The risk of neurotoxicity is lower in patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The incidence of HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma has decreased in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Patients with HIV-associated primary CNS lymphoma have a worse prognosis but may respond to highly active antiretroviral therapy, whole-brain radiation therapy or therapies directed against the Epstein-Barr virus.

1329,"Radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal melanoma metastases. BACKGROUND: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating metastatic melanoma involving the spine has previously been limited. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously to limit the dose delivered to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of melanoma spinal metastases in 28 patients.METHODS: Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases were treated with a single-session radiosurgery technique (1 cervical, 11 thoracic, 13 lumbar, and 11 sacral) with a follow-up period of 3-43 months (median 13 months). Tumor volume ranged from 4.1 to 153 cm3 (mean 47.6 cm3). Twenty-three of the 36 lesions had received prior external beam irradiation.RESULTS: Maximum tumor dose was maintained at 17.5-25 Gy (mean 21.7 Gy). Spinal cord volume receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 cm3 (mean 0.26 cm3); spinal canal volume at the cauda equina level receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 cm3 (mean 0.98 cm3). No radiation-induced toxicity occurred during the follow-up period. Axial and radicular pain improved in 27 of 28 patients (96%) who were treated primarily for pain. Long-term tumor control was seen in 3 of 4 cases treated primarily for radiographic tumor progression. Two patients went on to require open surgical intervention for tumor progression resulting in neurological deficit.CONCLUSIONS: Spinal radiosurgery offers a therapeutic modality for the safe delivery of large dose fractions of radiation therapy in a single fraction for the management of spinal metastases in patients with advanced melanoma that are often poorly controlled with alternative conventional external beam radiation therapy, and is successful even in patients with previously irradiated lesions.",Excluded
1330,"CyberKnife frameless single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery for tumors of the sacrum. OBJECT: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial lesions is well established. The experience with radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal and sacral lesions is more limited. Sacral lesions should be amenable to radiosurgical treatment similar to that used for their intracranial counterparts. The authors evaluated a single- fraction radiosurgical technique performed using the CyberKnife Real-Time Image-Guided Radiosurgery System for the treatment of the sacral lesion. METHOD(S): The CyberKnife is a frameless radiosurgery system based on the coupling of an orthogonal pair of x-ray cameras to a dynamically manipulated robot-mounted linear accelerator possessing six degrees of freedom, which guides the therapy beam to the intended target without the need for frame-based fixation. All sacral lesions were located and tracked for radiation delivery relative to fiducial bone markers placed percutaneously. Eighteen patients were treated with single-fraction radiosurgery. Tumor histology included one benign and 17 malignant tumors. Dose plans were calculated based on computerized tomography scans acquired using 1.25-mm slices. Planning treatment volume was defined as the radiographically documented tumor volume with no margin. Tumor dose was maintained at 12 to 20 Gy to the 80% isodose line (mean 15 Gy). Tumor volume ranged from 23.6 to 187.4 ml (mean 90 ml). The volume of the cauda equina receiving greater than 8 Gy ranged from 0 to 1 ml (mean 0.1 ml). All patients underwent the procedure in an outpatient setting. No acute radiation toxicity or new neurological deficits occurred during the mean follow-up period of 6 months. Pain improved in all 13 patients who were symptomatic prior to treatment. No tumor progression has been documented on follow-up imaging. CONCLUSION(S): Stereotactic radiosurgery was found to be feasible, safe, and effective for the treatment of both benign and malignant sacral lesions. The major potential benefits of radiosurgical ablation of sacral lesions are relatively short treatment time in an outpatient setting and minimal or no side effects. This new technique offers a new and important therapeutic modality for the primary treatment of a variety of sacral tumors or for lesions not amenable to open surgical techniques.",Excluded
1331,"Determination of dosimetric perturbations caused by aneurysm clip in stereotactic radiosurgery using gel phantoms and EBT-Gafchromic films. Some radiotherapy patients are treated with titanium surgical aneurysm clips in the radiation field. This is of particular importance for stereotactic radiosurgery brain treatments, where the length of the blade of the clip may be comparable to the size of the radiation field. This study seeks to determine the extent of the dosimetric effects caused by surgical clips in stereotactic radiosurgery, using polyacrylamide gel phantoms and EBT type Gafchromic films. Using gel phantoms scanned with magnetic resonance imaging scanner, dose enhancement of around 20% was noted at distances less than 2 mm away from the clip surface. Gafchromic films showed about 6% variations in the dose up to few millimeters from the clip. These experimental results confirmed results predicted by Monte Carlo simulation techniques for higher density material surgical clips such as lead and platinum. Moreover, these experimental measurements clearly indicate dose reduction due to radiation attenuation behind the clip of about 4%. © 2008 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded
1332,"Characterization of skin reactions and pain reported by patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer at different sites. BACKGROUND: Skin reactions and pain are commonly reported side effects of radiation therapy (RT).OBJECTIVE: To characterize RT-induced symptoms according to treatment site subgroups and identify skin symptoms that correlate with pain.METHODS: A self-report survey-adapted from the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and the McGill Pain Questionnaire--assessed RT-induced skin problems, pain, and specific skin symptoms. Wilcoxon Sign Ranked tests compared mean severity or pre- and post-RT pain and skin problems within each RT-site subgroup. Multiple linear regression (MLR) investigated associations between skin symptoms and pain.RESULTS: Survey respondents (N = 106) were 58% female and on average 64 years old. RT sites included lung, breast, lower abdomen, head/neck/brain, and upper abdomen. Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in treatment site pain and skin problems (P < or = .007). Patients receiving head/neck/brain RT reported increased skin problems (P < .0009). MLR showed that post-RT skin tenderness and tightness were most strongly associated with post-RT pain (P = .066 and P = .122, respectively).LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, exploratory analyses, and nonvalidated measure.CONCLUSIONS: Only patients receiving breast RT reported significant increases in pain and skin problems at the RT site while patients receiving head/neck/brain RT had increased skin problems but not pain. These findings suggest that the severity of skin problems is not the only factor that contributes to pain and that interventions should be tailored to specifically target pain at the RT site, possibly by targeting tenderness and tightness. These findings should be confirmed in a larger sampling of RT patients.",Excluded
1334,"Expandable intramedullary nails for fixation of tibial shaft fractures. Interlocking intramedullary nailing is currently the preferred treatment for most tibial fractures requiring operative treatment, with good results and a relatively low complication rate as reported in large clinical series. However, vascular and neurological complications caused by interlocking screws have been reported. In addition, insertion of distal interlocking screws can be technically demanding and may entail substantial exposure. We present the results with an expandable self-locking nail in the management of 52 AO type A and B tibial shaft fractures. The mean time to union was 15.8 weeks and the rate of union was 98%. The average surgical time was 60 minutes. Complications were those usually seen in diaphysis nailing and no complication was noted during nail expansion. Interlocking screws are not necessary, which reduces the risk of iatrogenic lesions. The expandable nail allows effective management of AO type A and B diaphyseal fractures of the tibia, a lower radiation exposure and shorter operative time.",Excluded

The wounds of Groups E, F, G and H were subjected to 3.64 J/cm2 dose of low-level laser, using a helium-neon system with an output of 8.5 mW, continuous wave at 632.8 nm. Histopathologically, healing was different between various suture patterns and between low level laser therapy (LLLT) and non-LLLT-groups. The results suggest that the 3-layer pattern was the best and LLLT could accelerate healing of perforating wounds of the teat in dairy cattle.",Excluded

1338,"Evidence of time-dependent prognostic factors predicting early death but not long-term outcome in primary CNS lymphoma: A Study of 91 patients. Long-term primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) survivors could have multiple adverse prognostic factors at diagnosis such as age, performance status (PS), site of the tumour (deep vs superficial), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and CSF protein level. Whether these five prognostic factors integrated in the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) score have a time-dependent effect is questionable. Among 132 PCNSL patients treated at our institution between 1984 and 2006, 91 available patients for IELSG score were evaluated by time-segmented analysis. Of the 91 patients, 21% had 0-1, 59% had 2-3 and 20% had 4-5 adverse IELSG prognostic scores. With a median follow-up of 102months, the median overall survival (OS) of the 91 patients with the five prognostic factors of IELSG score was 33months (95% CI, 17 to 55) compared with 14months (95% CI, 3 to 23) for the remaining 41 patients whose CSF protein level was lacking in the IELSG score. These 41 patients who did not have lumbar puncture presented a poorer PS at diagnosis and a lower treatment response rate. While confirming the prognostic value of the IELSG score, we observed a time-dependent effect of age, PS and tumour site; all three lost their prognostic value after 6months from diagnosis, while LDH remained a constant predictor of OS. No prognostic impact of CSF protein level was reported. Patients with older age, poor PS and deep brain involvement are at risk of death during the first months after diagnosis but could have a favourable long-term outcome after the treatment period. New prognostic factors predicting long-term outcome remain to be determined. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded
1339,"Electrically evoked GABA release in rat hippocampus CA1 region and its changes during kindling epileptogenesis. Previous findings on changes in K+-induced GABA release from hippocampal slices during kindling epileptogenesis were reinvestigated using physiological electrical stimulation. For that purpose, a procedure was developed enabling neurochemical monitoring of GABA release locally in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices upon tetanic stimulation of Schaffer-collateral fibers. In the presence of a GABA reuptake blocker, subsequent application of short (3 s) pulses of 50-Hz stimuli induced a local transient increase in GABA release. In slices from fully kindled animals, 24 h after the last generalized seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release was increased in comparison to control slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, 4-5 weeks after the last seizure, tetanically stimulated GABA release had returned to control levels. Application of the broad low-affinity GABAB receptor antagonist saclofen increased the tetanically stimulated GABA release in control slices, but had no effect in fully kindled slices. In slices from long-term kindled animals, however, saclofen enhanced GABA release similarly as in control slices. We conclude that the transient increase in tetanus-induced GABA release during kindling epileptogenesis is seizure-related, and probably caused by temporarily impaired presynaptic GABAB receptors. The possible relevance of this finding for GABA transmission in epilepsy is discussed.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of selenium supplementation on the antioxidant enzymatic system (such as GPx, GR and SOD), GSH and selenium level in liver, kidney, muscle and brain of static magnetic field (SMF) exposed rats. Male adult rats were divided into control rats (n=6), SMF-exposed rats (128 mT; 1h/day for 5 days), selenium-treated rats (Na(2)SeO(3), 0.2mg/l, in drinking water for 4 weeks) and co-exposed rats (selenium for 4 weeks and SMF during the last 5 consecutive days). Sub-acute exposure to SMF induces a decrease of selenium levels in kidney, muscle and brain. Our results also revealed a decrease of GPx activities in kidney and muscle. By contrast, SMF exposure increased total GSH levels and total SOD activities in liver, while glutathione reductase activity is unaffected. Selenium supplementation in SMF-exposed rats restored selenium levels in kidney, muscle and brain and elevated the activities of GPx in kidney and muscle to those of control group. In the liver, selenium supplementation failed to bring down the elevated levels of total GSH and SOD activity. Our investigations suggested that sub-acute exposure to SMF altered the antioxidant response by decreasing the level of total selenium in kidney, muscle and brain.

1341,"Review article: cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy in adults: a work in progress. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has potential as a noninvasive brain monitor across a spectrum of disorders. In the last decade, there has been a rapid expansion of clinical experience using NIRS to monitor cerebral oxygenation, and there is some evidence that NIRS-guided brain protection protocols might lead to a reduction in perioperative neurologic complications after cardiac surgery. However, there are no data to support the wider application of NIRS during routine surgery under general anesthesia, and its application in brain injury, where it might be expected to have a key monitoring role, is undefined. Although increasingly sophisticated apparatuses, including broadband and time-resolved spectroscopy systems, provide insights into the potential of NIRS to measure regional cerebral oxygenation, hemodynamics, and metabolism in real-time, these innovations have yet to translate into effective monitor-guided brain protection treatment strategies.

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate whether a disease site-specific, multi-institutional knowledge based-planning (KBP) model can improve the quality of intensity modulated radiation therapy treatment planning for patients enrolled in the head and neck NRG-HN001clinical trial and to establish a threshold of improvements of treatment plans submitted to the clinical trial. Methods and Materials: Fifty treatment plans for patients enrolled in the NRG-HN001 clinical trial were used to build a KBP model; the model was then used to reoptimize 50 other plans. We compared the dosimetric parameters of the submitted and KBP reoptimized plans. We compared differences between KBP and submitted plans for single- and multi-institutional treatment plans. Result(s): Mean values for the dose received by 95% of the planning target volume (PTV_6996) and for the maximum dose (D0.03cc) of PTV_6996 were 0.5 Gy and 2.1 Gy higher in KBP plans than in the submitted plans, respectively. Mean values for D0.03cc to the brain stem, spinal cord, optic nerve_R, optic nerve_L, and chiasm were 2.5 Gy, 1.9 Gy, 6.4 Gy, 6.6 Gy, and 5.7 Gy lower in the KBP plans than in the submitted plans. Mean values for D<inf>mean</inf> to parotid_R and parotid_L glands were 2.2 Gy and 3.8 Gy lower in KBP plans, respectively. In 33 out of 50 KBP plans, we observed improvements in sparing of at least 7 organs at risk (OARs) (brain stem, spinal cord, optic nerves (R & L), chiasm, and parotid glands [R & L]). A threshold of improvement of OARs sparing of 5% of the prescription dose was established for providing the quality assurance results back to the treating institution. Conclusion(s): A disease site-specific, multi-institutional, clinical trial-based KBP model improved sparing of OARs in a large number of reoptimized plans submitted to the NRG-HN001 clinical trial, and the model is being used as an offline quality assurance tool.

Introduction and Aims: Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RF), also named Ormond's disease, is a rare disease characterized by the presence of inflammation and fibrous tissue in the retroperitoneum. it can be idiopathic or associated to neoplasia, systemic disease, drugs and radiation Methods: We describe our cohort composed by 16 patients (11 males). The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 59.2+/-10.9; 50% were smokers and with history of atopy in 5 of them. Five patients had a cancer (2 cuteneous, 1 hematological, 1 ginecological and 1 neuroendocrine). Diagnosis of RF was made with CT, histology, ultrasonography or MRI (respectively in 10, 3, 2 and 1 patients). Seven patients underwent PET, that showed a pathologic enhancement in retroperitoneal and periaortic lesions. Four patients had an histological diagnosis of IgG4 related disease. Mean duration of follow-up was 33 months. Result(s): At the time of the diagnosis, the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 54.2+/-27.6 ml/min and 14 patients had an impaired renal function. Six patients presented also hydroureteronephrosis that worsened the renal function (mean eGFR 32.2+/-16.9), with ureteral stenting requirement. After resolution of ureteral stenosis there was a significant recovery (mean eGFR 56.9+/-23), comparable to the patient that did not required the stent. Only 1 patient required dialysis for hyperpotassemia before positioning ureteral stent. the mean value of plasmatic IgG was 1638+/-1000 mg/dL (normal range 700-1600 mg/dl), resulting high for 5 patients. The mean IgG4 concentration was 391.6+/-585.8 mg/dL, higher than normal range in 50% of patients. For 12 patients we calculated IgG4/IgG ratio, an index suggested by some authors as a potential tool to discriminate patient with RF linked to IgG4 related disease. Three patients had an IgG4/IgG ratio <8% and 9 patients >8%. In our cohort, the IgG4/IgG ratio presented a direct correlation (p=0,009) with extraperitoneal manifestations of the IgG4 related disease, such as pancreatitis, colangitis, encephalitis and ocular involvement. One patient showed modest eosinophilia and almost 43% of patients had positive antinuclear antibodies. C3 and C4 component fractions were low in 2 patients who had highest levels of IgG4 and IgG4/IgG ratio and severe systemic involvement. Erythrosedimentation rate and C-protein reactive were almost normal (respectively mean values 44.8 mm and 1.63 mg/dl). Conclusion(s): almost all of the patients (87,5 %) showed impaired renal function. Kidney involvement did not seem to be linked just to obstructive uropathy. In fact after stenting, eGFR values were comparable in the 2 groups (obstructed vs not-obstructed). Further evaluations are required to better understand the renal impairment and the physiopathology of RF. Our data would suggest that RF might have a direct impact on renal function probably due to igG4 related disease.",Excluded
1346,"Influence of surface pattern and sterilisation of solvent-cast films for peripheral nerve guidance. INTRODUCTION : Damage to peripheral nerves can result in considerable morbidity and loss of function. Poly-(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and PCL/poly-(D,L-lactic acid) (PLA) blend nerve guidance conduits are a promising alternative to autologous nerve grafts in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury1. The surface morphology of scaffolds is known to influence their physical properties and cell behaviour. Yet, as scaffolds progress further towards clinical trials, it is imperative that they are subjected to/and capable of withstanding approved sterilisation methods, such as gamma irradiation, without causing detrimental effects to the material physical properties and/or cell response. This study investigates how surface patterns affect PCL films and aims to assess whether PCL/PLA blend scaffolds are able to withstand gamma irradiation sufficient for medical sterilisation. METHOD(S): PCL and PCL/PLA (4:1 w/w) blend solutions were prepared using dichloromethane (3% w/v). Smooth, pitted and micro-grooved PCL films were cast and imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while tensile testing was used to quantify their mechanical properties (Instron 1122, load cell 0.010 kN). NG108-15 cells were cultured up to 14 days on the various PCL film surfaces before fluorescence and SEM imaging were performed both to confirm biocompatibility and observe cell behaviour. PCL/PLA blend films will be sterilised at 7 incremental doses of gamma radiation (15-45 kGy) (Isotron). Mechanical testing, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography will be utilised to evaluate any changes in material properties or structure in comparison to unirradiated control samples. RESULT(S): The mean thickness of all types of solvent-cast film was less than 100 mum. The average porosity of the pitted PCL films was 53% with 2.1+/-0.5 mum diameter pits. Smooth films were significantly stronger, with greater modulus and strain (Table 1*p<0.01). NG108-15 cells attached and proliferated on the PCL films in vitro up to 14 days. However, only on the grooved samples did cells display organisation, demonstrating alignment in the same orientation as the grooves (Fig. 1). (Table presented) Discussion & CONCLUSION(S): These findings support the use of solvent cast PCL films for fabricating nerve guides. Pits in the surface of the inner lumen are beneficial in cell growth and grooved surfaces enable the alignment of neurons. In this work all patterned surfaces had sufficient tensile strength to function as nerve conduits. PCL/PLA blended films were tested to see whether they would withstand medical-grade sterilisation. It is hypothesised that the polymer films will not be significantly affected by gamma irradiation.",Excluded

1348,"Enhancement of dosimetric optimization for stereotactic radiosurgery. [French]. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a technique for treatment of intracranial lesions requiring high precision in all steps - from image acquisition to final irradiation. One of most difficult steps is the treatment planning phase, consisting of determination of irradiation parameters sufficient to cover the target volume by avoiding sensitive volumes. A manual and empirical definition can be very long and difficult, especially in the case of complex target volumes situated in sensitive zones. As in conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery has taken advantages from dosimetric optimization. The question is: 'What is the configuration of irradiation parameters used in order to obtain the treatment plan by satisfying defined constraints?'. The purpose of this article is to summarize optimization methods used in radiosurgery and to describe the technical alternatives proposed for this treatment as well as the possibilities of plan evaluation between different techniques. This purpose will be illustrated by the optimization methodology used in the Center Oscar Lambret of Lille, France for the radiosurgical treatment with linear accelerator.",Excluded

1350,"Reproducibility of patient positioning during routine radiotherapy, as assessed by an integrated megavoltage imaging system. A portal imaging system has been used, in conjunction with a movie measurement technique to measure set-up errors for 15 patients treated with radiotherapy of the pelvis and for 12 patients treated with radiotherapy of the brain. The pelvic patients were treated without fixation devices and the brain patients were treated with individually-moulded plastic shells. As would be expected the brain treatments were found to be more accurate than the pelvic treatments. Results are presented in terms of five error types: random error from treatment to treatment, error between mean treatment position and simulation position, random simulation error, systematic simulator-to-treatment errors and total treatment error. For the brain patients the simulation-to-treatment error predominates and random treatment errors were small (95% < or = 3 mm, 77% < or = 1.5 mm). Vector components of the systematic simulation-to-treatment errors were 1-2 mm with maximal random simulation error of +/- 5 mm (2 S.D.). There is much interest in the number of verification films necessary to evaluate treatment accuracy. These results indicate that one check film performed at the first treatment is likely to be sufficient for set-up evaluation. For the pelvis the random treatment error is larger (95% < or = 4.5 mm, 87% < or = 3 mm). The systematic simulation-to-treatment error is up to 3 mm and the maximal random simulation error is +/- 6 mm (2 S.D.). Thus corrections made solely on the basis of a first day check film may not be sufficient for adequate set-up evaluation.",Excluded
1351,"An acoustic window to the urinary bladder: Usual and unusual pathologies. Background Information: The acoustic properties of urinary fluid and the superficial location of the bladder make it an excellent candidate for sonographic evaluation. In addition to being a quick and portable screening modality and offering the added benefit of not exposing the patient to ionizing radiation, ultrasound can definitively diagnose a variety of pathologic processes of the bladder, both benign and malignant. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Briefly discuss ultrasound technique used in optimal evaluation of the bladder. Discuss normal sonographic appearance of the bladder. Illustrate and describe the imaging appearance associated with a variety of both benign and malignant bladder pathologies. Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Using ultrasound as the primary imaging modality, and with CT and MRI support, a variety of common and not so common pathologies of the bladder will be illustrated and discussed. These will include benign entities such as cystitis, calculi, bladder hernias, neurogenic bladder, ureterocele, bladder rupture and fistulization, foreign bodies, bladder endometriosis, and pseudotumors. Malignant processes such as urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and metastatic disease will also be included. The emphasis will be on the role of ultrasound in narrowing the differential, and in suggesting the need for further radiologic or urologic evaluation. Conclusion(s): Ultrasound has emerged as a first-line modality in the radiological evaluation of the urinary bladder. A thorough knowledge of the spectrum of sonographic appearances associated with urinary bladder pathologies is essential toward generating a concise, accurate, and clinically relevant differential diagnosis.",Excluded

1353,"Oncolytic herpes simplex virus and radiation combination therapy results in a systemic immune response to inhibit neuroblastoma tumor growth. INTRODUCTION: Viral and gene therapy are promising approaches to treating neuroblastoma. An oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) expressing the cytokine Interleukin-12 (M002) was previously shown to inhibit neuroblastoma xenograft growth. We hypothesized that human neuroblastoma tumors express the viral entry receptor, CD111. Additionally, we hypothesized that M002 would produce a secondary immune response to inhibit murine neuroblastoma growth distant from the treatment site in an immunocompetent model. METHOD(S): Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human neuroblastoma tumor specimens (IRB-X111123007) were stained for CD111. NXS2 murine neuroblastoma cells (7.5x10^5 cells) were injected into bilateral flanks of immunocompetent mice (IACUC- 120409363). Established right-sided tumors were treated with M002 (1x107 pfu) and radiation (3Gy).Half of these mice received a repeat right-sided dose of M002 and radiation. Tumor volumes on both flanks were measured every 2 days. Data were compared with appropriate statistical analysis with significance p<=0.05. RESULT(S): All 12 human neuroblastoma specimens expressed CD111. In the murine bilateral flank tumor model, repeat treatment of the right flank with M002 and radiation led to significant inhibition of tumor growth in the untreated flank tumor compared to animals who received a single dose to the right flank (323.44 +/- 215.51 mm3 vs. 955.08 +/- 366.54 mm3, p<=0.05). CONCLUSION(S): CD111 expression was present in human neuroblastoma specimens, indicating that oHSV would infect these tumors. M002 inhibited progression of murine tumors both locally and distant from the site of therapy, demonstrating a systemic effect. These data support the potential use of oHSV therapy to treat recurrent or metastatic neuroblastoma.",Excluded
1355,"MDM2 overexpression is associated with short survival in adults with medulloblastoma. In adult medulloblastoma, postoperative radiotherapy is significantly effective in prolonging time to recurrence and survival time; however, the response of individual cases to radiotherapy, that is the total survival, is different. Apoptosis is an important cellular response to radiation. It can be hypothesized that the individual radiosensitivity of medulloblastomas depends on the individual capability to undergo apoptosis. p53 protein is involved in the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation; loss of function of p53 can be the consequence not only of TP53 mutations, but also of amplification and/or overexpression of the MDM2 gene. We have analyzed cerebellar medulloblastomas from 51 adults (>16 years of age) for MDM2 gene amplification (by differential polymerase chain reaction assay), TP53 gene mutation (by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-8), and immunohistochemical expression of p53 (clone DO1) and MDM2 (clone IF2). The results have been evaluated in relation to age, tumor location, classic or desmoplastic type, MIB-1 labeling index, and total survival. No tumor had MDM2 amplification. Ten tumors had MDM2 positive tumor cells. One case had a mutated TP53 gene; 16/51 cases had intense p53 immunostaining. Only 2 MDM2 protein-positive tumors were also p53-positive. Both subgroups of MDM2 - and p53-positive tumors had a significantly shorter postoperative survival. In conclusion, the overexpression of MDM2 protein and the accumulation of wild-type p53 are unrelated in adult medulloblastoma; they may result in a reduced apoptotic response after radiotherapy and contribute to a shortened survival. Also, MDM2 amplification and TP53 gene mutation are rare events in medulloblastomas of adults.",Excluded
1356,"Mechanisms and Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation. The US Air Force Office of Scientific Research convened a meeting of researchers in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, engineering, and medicine to discuss most pressing issues facing ongoing research in the field of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and related techniques. In this study, we present opinions prepared by participants of the meeting, focusing on the most promising areas of research, immediate and future goals for the field, and the potential for hormesis theory to inform tDCS research. Scientific, medical, and ethical considerations support the ongoing testing of tDCS in healthy and clinical populations, provided best protocols are used to maximize safety. Notwithstanding the need for ongoing research, promising applications include enhancing vigilance/attention in healthy volunteers, which can accelerate training and support learning. Commonly, tDCS is used as an adjunct to training/rehabilitation tasks with the goal of leftward shift in the learning/treatment effect curves. Although trials are encouraging, elucidating the basic mechanisms of tDCS will accelerate validation and adoption. To this end, biomarkers (eg, clinical neuroimaging and findings from animal models) can support hypotheses linking neurobiological mechanisms and behavioral effects. Dosage can be optimized using computational models of current flow and understanding dose-response. Both biomarkers and dosimetry should guide individualized interventions with the goal of reducing variability. Insights from other applied energy domains, including ionizing radiation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and low-level laser (light) therapy, can be prudently leveraged.",Excluded
1357,"Structural plasticity of the adult central nervous system: Insights from the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. [French]. Accumulating evidence renders the dogma obsolete according to which the structural organization of the brain would remain essentially stable in adulthood, changing only in response to a need for compensatory processes during increasing age and degeneration. It has indeed become clear from investigations on various models that the adult nervous system can adapt to physiological demands by altering reversibly its synaptic circuits. This potential for structural and functional modifications results not only from the plastic properties of neurons but also from the inherent capacity of the glial cellular components to undergo remodeling as well. This is currently known for astrocytes, the major glial cells in brain which are well-recognized as dynamic partners in the mechanisms of synaptic transmission, and for the tanycytes and pituicytes which contribute to the regulation of neurosecretory processes in neurohemal regions of the hypothalamus. Studies on the neuroendocrine hypothalamus, whose role is central in homeostatic regulations, have gained good insights into the spectacular neuronal-glial rearrangements that may subserve functional plasticity in the adult brain. Following pioneering works on the morphological reorganizations taking place in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system under certain physiological conditions such as dehydration and lactation, studies on the gonadotropic system that orchestrates reproductive functions have re-emphasized the dynamic interplay between neurons and glia in brain structural plasticity processes. This review summarizes the major contributions provided by these researches in the field and also addresses the question of the morphological rearrangements that occur on a 24-h basis in the central component of the circadian clock responsible for the temporal aspects of endocrine regulations. Taken together, the reviewed data highlight the close cooperation between neurons and glia in developing strategies for functional adaptation of the brain to the changing conditions of the internal and external environment. © Societe de Biologie, 2011.",Excluded

The authors present a case of a pseudoaneurysm involving the carotid artery bifurcation following radiation therapy. A saphenous vein graft was used to establish continuity between the common and the internal carotid arteries. A vascular shunt was used to maintain cerebral perfusion during surgery. This case highlights the technical difficulties encountered in correcting this condition. This case exemplifies the technical difficulties that are encountered in a complicated case such as this. Numerous previous operations and radiotherapy compounded the hazards of the surgical procedure.

A central role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) as important mediators in both neurotoxicity and neuroprotection has been demonstrated. However, data concerning the role of ROS/RNS in radiation-induced damage in the developing brain are scarce.

1360,"MIBG thyroid uptake. Background-Aim: Cardiac sympathetic innervation imaging by 123I-MIBG has been widely adopted in evaluating Pts affected by congestive heart failure (CHF) to assess prognosis, response to treatment, risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death and prediction of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy. The same tracer has been used in patients with neurological disease to assess the state of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system at a post-ganglionic level that is altered in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), even without clinical signs of dysautonomia, and normal in other Parkinsonism such as multisystem atrophy (MSA). Both cardiological and neurological pts are pretreated with Lugol's oral solution and/or potassium perchlorate to prevent thyroid uptake of unlabeled 123I and to limit the thyroid radiation exposure. However, despite the inhibition of the iodide pump a thyroid visualization is frequently observed in MIBG scans in pts imaged for cardiac or neurological disorders. Recently a pt with hyperthyroidism, normal calcitonin level and CHF came to our observation for MIBG imaging. There was a high thyroid uptake of the tracer despite he was on therapy with Amiodarone. A scan with 123I-Iodide confirmed the absence of any uptake. Aim of the study was the evaluation of the thyroid uptake in pts undergone to 123I-MIBG scan for CHF and movement disorders. Method(s): We have reviewed the 123I-MIBG scintigraphies of 57 pts recruited in three different centres (Brescia, Castelfranco Veneto and Veruno) who were imaged at 15' and 4 h and in whom the thyroid was included in the field of view of the thorax. 42 pts underwent MIBG imaging for cardiological purposes and 15 for neurological disorders. 2/3 centres pretreated the pts with Lugol's oral solution and/or potassium perchlorate and one centre did not and the pts were referred as control group. The following parameters were evaluated. Tracer wash out from heart (HWO) and thyroid (TWO), heart to mediastinum ratio (H/M), thyroid to mediastinum ratio (T/M) at 15' and 4 h Results: In the cardiac pts HWO was 23 +/- 7.2 % and TWO was 11.4 +/- 8.2 % (p<.0001). The TWO was 12.2 +/- 13.4 % in centres 1 and 2 and 10.05 +/- 8.97 % in centre 3 (control group), p = n.s. The T/M ratio was 1.37 +/- 0.17 in Centre 1-2 and 1.3 +/- 0.35 in Centre 3 p = n.s. (Control group- no pretreatment). In neurological pts the HWO was 26 +/- 8.1 % and the TWO was 20,32c6,41, p<.05. The difference in TWO was statistically significant (p<.01) between cardiological and neurological pts, whereas the HWO was not (p = ns). The 4 h H/M was 1.49 +/- 0.23 in cardiological pts and 1.4 +/- 0.39 in neurological pts (p = n.s.) The 4 h T/M was 1.33 +/- 0.3 in cardiological pts and 1.15 +/- 0.13 in neurological pts (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the thyroid visualization in MIBG imaging is not related to accumulation of 123I-iodide but to 123IMIBG uptake as an expression of thyroid sympathetic innervation. On the basis of our observation pretreatment with Lugol's oral solution and/or potassium perchlorate is therefore not justified and the procedure guidelines should be revised. Different values of TWO and T/M ratio in cardiological and neurological disorders probably express a different attitude of thyroid dopaminergic receptors in more generalized sympathetic disorder in Parkinson's disease rather than an activation of the sympatho-adrenergic system in CHF.",Excluded

Background: Antiemetics are being used both for the treatment and prophylaxis of opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV) in clinical practice, despite the lack of evidence for the prophylactic benefit. Studies among Japanese physicians trained in cancer pain management demonstrated over 80% prescribe antiemetics, with neuroleptic antipsychotics (prochlorperazine 88%) as the most commonly prescribed drugs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the practice among Italian experts on supportive care in cancer of the prophylactic use of antiemetics when starting opioids prescription for OINV prevention. Material(s) and Method(s): From January to March 2017, we carried out a web-based cross sectional national survey. The survey was created with the GoogleDocsTM online surveys maker (https://docs.google.com). All invited participants received e-mail with the 12-items electronic questionnaire that was only accessible through a direct link. The questionnaire assessed the physicians' practice and beliefs regarding the prophylactic antiemetics prescription when they start opioids in patients with cancer pain (7 items) and other demographics data (5 items). According to the exploratory intent of the survey, we did not predefine any formal statistical hypothesis or sample size. Result(s): 112/256 responded to the electronic questionnaire (ORR 43.7%): 54 medical oncologists, 16 anesthesiologists, 11 radiation/clinical oncologists, 5 internists, 2 geriatrics, 1 infectivologist, 1 general surgeon. 22 physicians declared no formal medical specialization. Responders were geographically evenly distributed among Italian areas and came from palliative care units (61), community hospitals (21), education hospitals (20) and comprehensive cancer centers (10). 45% prescribed prophylactic antiemetics at the beginning of opioid prescription, and the most commonly prescribed drug for this purpose were prokinetics such as metoclopramide and domperidone (84%), followed by 5-HT3 antagonists (8%), neuroleptic antipsychotics (6%), corticosteroids (2%). Among physicians who prescribed prophylactic antiemetics, 41 (82%) also prescribed antiemetics (prokinetics as well) for use as treatment at the occurrence of OINV. Conclusion(s): Italian physicians do not commonly prescribe prophylactic antiemetics for OINV. Unlike previous reported evidences, dopamine antagonists resulted the most commonly prescribed drugs. Prospective clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the real efficacy of this practice.",Excluded
1363,"Adult patient doses in interventional neuroradiology. We investigated radiation doses to 149 adult patients who underwent interventional neuroradiologic procedures, consisting of 132 patients who had diagnostic imaging examinations and 17 patients who had therapeutic procedures. The interventional procedures were carried out on a biplane system capable of performing fluoroscopy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The x-ray imaging system was interfaced to a patient dosimetry system, which computed surface (skin) doses based on the selected radiographic technique factors in each of the radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging modes. For each patient, an assessment was made of the maximum surface dose received during the procedure, which predicts the possibility of inducing deterministic effects. Knowledge of the surface doses, beam quality and x-ray cross sectional area permitted the computation of the total energy imparted to each patient. Energy imparted values were converted to effective dose, which provides an estimate of the stochastic radiation risk to the patient. The median surface dose for the frontal plane during diagnostic imaging examinations was 1.3 Gy, with a maximum surface dose of 5.1 Gy. The median surface dose for the frontal plane during therapeutic procedures was 2.8 Gy with a maximum surface dose of 5.0 Gy. Ratios of the lateral to frontal median surface doses were 0.47 for diagnostic examinations and 0.68 for interventional procedures. The median energy imparted was 1.8 J during fluoroscopy, and 4.3 J during radiography, showing that on average, 66% of the patient exposure comes from radiographic imaging (DSA). For diagnostic examinations, the median patient effective dose was 33 mSv, with a maximum of 152 mSv. For therapeutic procedures, the median patient effective dose was 74 mSv, with a maximum of 156 mSv.

1364,"Effect of radiographic techniques (kVp and mAs) on image quality and patient doses in digital subtraction angiography. We investigated how varying the x-ray tube voltage and image receptor input exposure affected image quality and patient radiation doses in interventional neuroradiologic imaging. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images were obtained of a phantom with 1 mm diameter vessels containing iodine at concentrations between 4.5 and 50 mg/cc. The detection threshold concentration of iodine was determined by inspecting DSA images obtained at a range of x-ray tube voltages and input exposure levels. Surface doses were obtained from measured x-ray tube output data, and corresponding values of energy imparted were determined using the exposure-area product incident on the phantom. In one series of experiments, the air kerma at the image intensifier (X) was varied between 0.44 muGy per frame and 8.8 muGy per frame at a constant x-ray tube voltage of 70 kVp. In a second series of experiments, the tube voltage was varied between 50 and 100 kVp, and the mAs adjusted to maintain a constant exposure level at the input of the image intensifier. At a constant x-ray tube voltage, the surface dose and energy imparted were directly proportional to the input exposure per frame used to acquire the DSA images. On our DSA system operated below 2.2 muGy per frame, the threshold iodine concentration was found to be proportional to X<sup>-0.57</sup>, which is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction for a quantum noise limited imaging system. Above 2.2 muGy per frame, however, the threshold iodine concentration was proportional to X<sup>-0.26</sup>, indicating that increasing the input exposure above this value will only achieve modest improvements in image quality. At a constant image intensifier input exposure level, increasing the x-ray tube voltage from 50 kVp to 100 kVp reduced the surface dose by a factor of 6.1, and the energy imparted by a factor of 3.5. The detection threshold iodine concentration was found to be proportional to kVp<sup>n</sup>, where n was 2.1 at 1.1 muGy per frame, and 1.6 at 3.9 muGy per frame. For clinical situations that can be modeled by a uniform phantom, reducing the x-ray tube voltage rather than increasing the exposure level would best achieve improvements on our DSA imaging system performance. © 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded

When radiation is used to treat nervous system cancer, exposure of adjacent normal nervous system tissue is unavoidable, and radiation-induced injury may occur. Acute injury is usually mild and transient, but late forms of radiation-induced nervous system injury are usually progressive and debilitating. Treatment with corticosteroids, surgery, and antioxidants is often ineffective. We treated 11 patients with late radiation-induced nervous system injuries (eight with cerebral radionecrosis, one with a myelopathy, and two with plexopathies, all unresponsive to dexamethasone and prednisone) with full anticoagulation. Some recovery of function occurred in five of the eight patients with cerebral radionecrosis, and all the patients with myelopathy or plexopathy. Anticoagulation was continued for 3 to 6 months. In one patient with cerebral radionecrosis, symptoms recurred after discontinuation of anticoagulation and disappeared again after reinstitution of treatment. We hypothesize that anticoagulation may arrest and reverse small-vessel endothelial injury--the fundamental lesion of radiation necrosis--and produce clinical improvement in some patients.",Excluded

To investigate changes in spatial orientation ability and walking performance following space flight, 7 astronaut subjects were asked pre- and post-flight to perform a goal directed locomotion paradigm which consisted of walking a triangular path with and without vision. This new paradigm, involving inputs from different sensory systems, allows quantification of several critical parameters, like orientation performance, walking velocities and postural stability, in a natural walking task. The paper presented here mainly focuses on spatial orientation performance quantified by the errors in walking the previously seen path without vision. Errors in length and reaching the corners did not change significantly from pre- to post-flight, while absolute angular errors slightly increased post-flight. The significant decrease in walking velocity and a change in head-trunk coordination while walking around the corners of the path observed post-flight may suggest that during re-adaptation to gravity the mechanisms which are necessary to perform the task have to be re-accomplished.",Excluded

Previous studies have implicated the human parietal lobes in the on-line guidance of action. However, no study to date has examined at what stage in the on-line adjustment process do the parietal lobes play their most critical role. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied over the left intraparietal sulcus as participants reached to grasp a small or large illuminated cylinder. On some trials, the illumination could suddenly switch from the small to large cylinder, or vice-versa. Small-Large switches were associated with relatively early grip aperture adjustments, whereas Large-Small switches were associated with relatively late grip aperture adjustments. When rTMS was applied early in the movement, it disrupted on-line adjustments to Small-Large target switches, but not to Large-Small switches. Conversely, when rTMS was applied late in the movement, it disrupted adjustments to Large-Small target switches but not to Small-Large switches. The timing of the disruption by rTMS appeared linked to the initiation of the adjustment. It was concluded that the left parietal lobe plays a critical role in initiating an on-line adjustment to a change in target size, but not in executing that adjustment.

Increasing evidence suggests that time-varying and static magnetic fields in the environment might affect the cardiovascular system. To explore the underlying physiology, the effect of static magnetic fields (SMFs) on the carotid baroreflex control of microcirculation was studied. Twenty-four hemodynamic monitorings were performed in rabbits sedated by pentobarbital infusion (5 mg/kg/h) during experiments that lasted 120 min. Mean femoral artery blood pressure, heart rate, and ear lobe skin microcirculatory blood flow, measured by microphotoelectric plethysmogram (MPPG), were simultaneously recorded before and after a 40 min exposure of the sinocarotid baroreceptors to Nd(2)-Fe(14)-B alloy magnets (n = 14) or sham magnets (n = 10, control series). The local SMF field was 350 mT, at the baroreceptors' site. Arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was estimated from heart rate/blood pressure response to intravenous bolus injections of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. A significant positive correlation was found between the SMF-induced increase in BRS (DeltaBRS = BRS(afterSMF) - BRS(priorSMF)) and the increment in microvascular blood flow (DeltaMPPG = MPPG(afterSMF) - MPPG(priorSMF)) (r = 0.66, p < 0.009). The SMF probably modulated the arterial baroreflex-mediated microcirculatory control.

We investigated the impact of downstaging on overall survival (OS) in LD-SCLC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the 210 LD-SCLC patients, who were treated with CRT at Seoul National University Hospital from Apr 1999 to Nov 2012. The relationship between downstaging and OS was analyzed, and subgroup analysis on the responders was performed. Result(s): Patients showing CR, partial remission (PR), and stable disease (SD)/progressive disease (PD) were 37.1% (n=78), 46.2% (n=97), and 16.7% (n=35), respectively. The median OS for CR, PR, and SD/PD were 47.9 months (mo), 21.8 mo, and 11.2 mo, respectively (P <0.001).

1373,"Clinical significance of downstaging in patients with limited-disease small-cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: We investigated the effect of downstaging on OS in LD-SCLC patients treated with first-line treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 210 LD-SCLC patients who were treated with first-line treatment at Seoul National University Hospital between April 1999 and November 2012. Compared with initial tumor, node, metastases (TNM) stage, cases that showed a lower TNM stage after treatment were defined as 'downstaging.' The relationship between downstaging and OS was analyzed, and a subgroup analysis on the responders was performed.RESULTS: After first-line treatment, 78 (37.1%) patients achieved complete response, 97 (46.2%) achieved PR, and 35 (16.7%) experienced stable disease or progressive disease. A hundred and fifty one patients (71.9%) showed downstaging of their diseases, and the remaining 59 patients (28.1%) showed no change or upstaging. The median OS for patients achieving downstaging and no change/upstaging were 32.8 months and 13.1 months, respectively (P < .001). Of the 97 patients who achieved PR, the OS was significantly longer in patients who showed downstaging than those who did not (25.8 months vs. 13.8 months, respectively; P = .004). In multivariate analyses, female sex, downstaging, lower initial TNM stage, and prophylactic cranial irradiation were independent good prognostic factors for OS.CONCLUSION: Downstaging might be an independent good prognostic factor in LD-SCLC. Specifically, downstaging is expected to be useful for stratification of patients achieving PR. Further prospective studies are warranted to verify whether patients who achieved PR without downstaging can be candidates for consolidation treatments after first-line treatment.",Excluded
1374,"Theranostic potential of a new [64Cu]-radiolabeled R-954 conjugate for kinin B1R positive tumors. Objectives The inducible GPCR B1 receptor (B1R) is a molecular signature of several types of solid cancers, including brain cancer. It is thought to be involved in tumor growth, invasion and angiogenesis. Thus, the B1R may represent a highly promising new target for the development of cancer-targeted theranostic agents Methods We developed a new 64Cu/NOTA-conjugated analog of our potent, selective B1R peptide antagonist, R-954 (AcOrn[Oic2,(alphaMe)Phe5,DbetaNal7,Ile8]-desArg9-bradykinin). Stability of the resulting peptide conjugate was evaluated ex vivo in undiluted rat blood samples and in vivo within systemic circulation in healthy rats. Intracellular uptake/nuclear localization and radiocytotoxicity of the conjugate were studied in cultured F98 glioma cells. In vivo biodistribution profile and efficacy of detection of malignant brain tumors by PET, were evaluated using the syngeneic, orthotopic F98 glioma rat model Results 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 showed remarkable stability in rat plasma after a 24h incubation. In vivo stability study showed mainly intact radiolabeled peptide (no occurrence of radiotracer metabolites) in rat blood circulation and urine, 90min after tail-vein injection. In vitro, the conjugate supressed, in a concentration-dependent manner, clonogenic growth of F98 cells possibly through an intracellular radiation mechanism (i.e. via cellular/nuclear uptake). Intravenous 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 properly detected relatively small brain tumors by PET at 1.5h and 20h after injection. Moreover, muPET signals coincided perfectly with those of contrast-enhanced MRI. The conjugate exhibited high tumor-to-contralateral background uptake and tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios (18:1 and 6:1, respectively) at 20h after injection. muPET signals generated by the radiotracer were i) inhibitable with excess of the unlabeled B1R antagonist R-954, ii) substantially reduced in B1R-knockdown F98 tumors, and iii) primarily absent in sham-operated animals, thus confirming the B1R-targeted tumor uptake specificity of the conjugate Conclusions Our findings provide initial proof-of-concept for the potential use of 64Cu/NOTA-betaAla-R-954 radiotracer in both diagnosis and treatment of brain cancer, and possibly other types of B1R-positive solid cancers.",Excluded
1375,"Evaluation of intracellular and extracellular domoic acid content in Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cell cultures under different light regimes. Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries is a diatom species associated with the production of domoic acid (DA), a water soluble neurotoxin that is easily transferred up in the food web, causing devastating effects on top marine organisms and humans. Despite studies on Pseudo-nitzschia are relevant to human health safety, partitioning of marine toxins between intracellular and extracellular fractions are poorly documented. This study aimed to determine the growth rates and DA content, both intracellular and extracellular, of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cultures at three different light settings (15, 120 and 560mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The optimal conditions for cell growth were observed at 120 and 560mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, whereas DA production was observed in P. multiseries at 15 and 120mumolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, ranging between 0.18-2.56 and 0.16-3.5pg DA cell<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Higher intracellular DA concentrations were found during the senescence phase at low light intensity and during the exponential phase at medium light intensity, while higher concentrations of dissolved DA were found at low and medium light intensities in the senescence phase reaching 3 and 10ng DA mL<sup>-1</sup> respectively. The amount of toxin released into the culture medium represents the most important fraction ranging between 63 and 98% during the exponential phase and nearly 99% during the senescence phase. In contrast, under low light intensity, dissolved DA was detected in the culture medium only during the senescence phase. This study confirms the importance of light intensity on DA production and clearly shows that dissolved domoic acid is an important fraction in Pseudo-nitzschia cultures, suggesting with the careful assumptions of results from static cultures extrapolated to bloom situations that waterborne exposure of marine organism should be considered during blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries.",Excluded
1376,"Light-entrained and brain-tuned circadian circuits regulate ILC3s and gut homeostasis. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are major regulators of inflammation, infection, microbiota composition and metabolism<sup>1</sup>. ILC3s and neuronal cells have been shown to interact at discrete mucosal locations to steer mucosal defence<sup>2,3</sup>. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether neuroimmune circuits operate at an organismal level, integrating extrinsic environmental signals to orchestrate ILC3 responses. Here we show that light-entrained and brain-tuned circadian circuits regulate enteric ILC3s, intestinal homeostasis, gut defence and host lipid metabolism in mice. We found that enteric ILC3s display circadian expression of clock genes and ILC3-related transcription factors. ILC3-autonomous ablation of the circadian regulator Arntl led to disrupted gut ILC3 homeostasis, impaired epithelial reactivity, a deregulated microbiome, increased susceptibility to bowel infection and disrupted lipid metabolism. Loss of ILC3-intrinsic Arntl shaped the gut 'postcode receptors' of ILC3s. Strikingly, light-dark cycles, feeding rhythms and microbial cues differentially regulated ILC3 clocks, with light signals being the major entraining cues of ILC3s. Accordingly, surgically or genetically induced deregulation of brain rhythmicity led to disrupted circadian ILC3 oscillations, a deregulated microbiome and altered lipid metabolism. Our work reveals a circadian circuitry that translates environmental light cues into enteric ILC3s, shaping intestinal health, metabolism and organismal homeostasis.",Excluded
1377,"Predicting Risk in Space: Genetic Markers for Differential Vulnerability to Sleep Restriction. Several laboratories have found large, highly reliable individual differences in the magnitude of cognitive performance, fatigue and sleepiness, and sleep homeostatic vulnerability to acute total sleep deprivation and to chronic sleep restriction in healthy adults. Such individual differences in neurobehavioral performance are also observed in space flight as a result of sleep loss. The reasons for these stable phenotypic differential vulnerabilities are unknown: such differences are not yet accounted for by demographic factors, IQ or sleep need, and moreover, psychometric scales do not predict those individuals cognitively vulnerable to sleep loss. The stable, trait-like (phenotypic) inter-individual differences observed in response to sleep loss-with intraclass correlation coefficients accounting for 58%-92% of the variance in neurobehavioral measures- point to an underlying genetic component. To this end, we utilized multi-day highly controlled laboratory studies to investigate the role of various common candidate gene variants-each independently-in relation to cumulative neurobehavioral and sleep homeostatic responses to sleep restriction. These data suggest that common genetic variations (polymorphisms) involved in sleep-wake, circadian, and cognitive regulation may serve as markers for prediction of inter-individual differences in sleep homeostatic and neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep restriction in healthy adults. Identification of genetic predictors of differential vulnerability to sleep restriction-as determined from candidate gene studies-will help identify astronauts most in need of fatigue countermeasures in space flight and inform medical standards for obtaining adequate sleep in space. This review summarizes individual differences in neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep deprivation and ongoing genetic efforts to identify markers of such differences.",Excluded
1378,"Frequent occurrence of therapeutically reversible CMV-associated encephalopathy during radiotherapy of the brain. BACKGROUND: Neurological decline during radio(chemo)therapy of the brain is often attributed to disease progression or side effects of radiotherapy. Diagnosis of opportunistic neurotropic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections is uncommon, even though high-grade gliomas and some brain metastases are known to contain CMV particles. We prospectively examined the frequency of CMV encephalopathy during radiotherapy of the brain.METHODS: Fifty patients requiring whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases (n = 27) or local radio(chemo)therapy of the brain for high-grade gliomas (n = 23) were observed in the prospective observational GLIO-CMV-01 study. MRIs and blood samples were obtained before, halfway through, and at the end of radiotherapy. MRIs were screened for disease progression or increased intracranial pressure. Blood was tested for anti-CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)M, anti-CMV IgG, and CMV DNA.RESULTS: Thirty-two of 50 (64%) patients were positive for anti-CMV IgG before radio(chemo)therapy. Fifteen of those 32 (48%) developed viremia during or up to 28 days after treatment. Thirteen of those 15 (87%) required treatment for CMV-associated encephalopathy. MRIs were negative for disease progression, edema, or bleeding. None of the patients negative for anti-CMV IgG developed viremia, suggesting a reactivation rather than a primary infection. In the group at risk consisting of anti-CMV IgG+ patients, age >65 (P = .004) and the amount of dexamethasone taken during radio(chemo)therapy (P = .004) were associated with an increased risk for CMV-associated encephalopathy. One hundred and fifty days after the start of radio(chemo)therapy, survival was 74% (14/19) (no encephalopathy) versus 54% (7/13) (encephalopathy) (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.03-1.86; P = .25).CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation frequently causes encephalopathy during radio(chemo)therapy of the brain.

1379,"Locoregional radioimmunotherapy in selected patients with malignant glioma: experiences, side effects and survival times. UNLABELLED: Prognosis of malignant glioma is very unfavourable mainly due to minimal tumour remnants in the peritumoural tissue. Intralesionally applied radioimmunotherapy is a possible therapeutical option with the potential to improve survival of patients with malignant glioma. We investigated side effects and survival after surgery, conventional radiotherapy and additional radioimmunotherapy with labelled tenascin-antibodies in patients with malignant glioma.METHODS: Since 1995, 37 patients were treated with radioimmunotherapy after resection and radiotherapy of a malignant glioma. Patients received antibodies labelled with yttrium-90 and iodine-131 in different doses into the tumour cavity via a previously implanted ommaya-reservoir. Treatment was applied in up to 8 cycles (mean 2.96 cycles) in time intervals of 6-8 weeks. Mean age was 46 years, histology was anaplastic astrocytoma in 13 patients and glioblastoma in 24 patients.RESULTS: For the whole group median survival time has not yet been reached. For glioblastoma the median survival time is 17 months, 5-year survival probability for anaplastic astrocytoma is 85% approximately. Quality of life was acceptable. Acute side effects following treatment were headache, seizures and worsening of pre-existing neurological symptoms. Late side effects were skin necrosis and, in 1 case, a delayed aphasia probably due to a vascular lesion.CONCLUSION: Radioimmunotherapy prolonged survival time in a selected group of patients with malignant gliomas as compared to a historical control group. Patients with anaplastic astrocytomas seem to have more benefit from this therapy than patients with glioblastomas.",Excluded

1381,"Electron beam irradiation as protection against the environmental release of recombinant molecules for biomaterials applications. In biomaterials applications there exists a need to protect against the environmental release of recombinant microorganisms and transmissible genetic material and to prevent the recovery of proprietary genetic information. Irradiation technologies have long been used to eliminate microorganisms associated with spoilage and contamination and recent studies have demonstrated that moderate doses of irradiation may be used to sterilize medically important proteins without causing adverse effects in their desirable biological properties. Recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing organophosphate hydrolase (OPH, E.C. 3.1.8.1), an important enzyme for the detection and decontamination of neurotoxic pesticides and chemical warfare agents, were subjected to electron beam irradiation to gauge its effect on enzymatic activity, cell viability and DNA recoverability. Bacterial samples were irradiated at 2, 20 and 200 kGy using a 10 MeV electron source. Irradiation levels of 2 to 20 kGy were sufficient to eliminate viable cells without affecting OPH enzymatic activity. Biologically active DNA was recovered via PCR from all samples through the 20 kGy irradiation level. While DNA was not recovered from samples at the 200 kGy exposure level, protein activity was reduced by 19 to 78%, depending on the method of cell preparation. These results demonstrate that irradiation can be effective in preventing the release of recombinant organisms intended for use in biomaterials applications without eliminating enzymatic activity and suggests that further research may indicate specific conditions whereby DNA recovery can be eliminated while retaining sufficient enzymatic activity for targeted biomaterials applications.",Excluded

1383,"Percutaneous cystolitholapaxy: A safe and effective alternative to open stone surgery for the management of complex bladder stones in patients with no urethral access. Objectives: Bladder stone management in patients with reconstructed bladders drained by Mitrofanoff catheterizable channels, with no urethral access, generates multiple challenges. Trans-Mitrofanoff access limits the size of endoscopic stone fragmenting devices, risking prolonged procedures, incomplete stone clearance and damage to the continent conduit. Access through previous surgical access sites risks bowel injury. This case series reports outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous cystolitholapaxy (PCCL), using ultrasound-guided access and direct track closure, thereby limiting radiation exposure and avoiding suprapubic catheters (SPCs). Patients and Methods: Seven PCCL procedures were performed in five patients with closed urethras. Average age 32 years, primary diagnoses: spina bifida, vertebrae, anus, trachea, esophagus, renal (VATER) syndrome, bladder exstrophy and traumatic brain injury. Four used Mitrofanoff stomas and one an SPC. Average largest stone was 18.57 mm (range 10-30 mm). Five procedures were for multiple stones (range 2-30 stones). Result(s): Each PCCL achieved complete stone clearance. Average operative time: 146 min (range 72-250 min). No intraoperative blood loss or bladder perforation. Postoperative median length of stay was 2 days. Conclusion(s): PCCL is a safe, minimally invasive alternative to open surgery for large and multiple bladder stones in individuals with complex lower urinary tract anatomy, specifically reconstructed bladders drained by Mitrofanoff catheterizable channels with no urethral access.

Purpose: Patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants benefit highly from MRI, however, access to MRI is restricted for these patients because of safety hazards associated with RF heating of the implant. To date, all MRI studies on RF heating of medical implants have been performed in horizontal closed-bore systems. Vertical MRI scanners have a fundamentally different distribution of electric and magnetic fields and are now available at 1.2T, capable of high-resolution structural and functional MRI. This work presents the first simulation study of RF heating of DBS implants in high-field vertical scanners. Method(s): We performed finite element electromagnetic simulations to calculate specific absorption rate (SAR) at tips of DBS leads during MRI in a commercially available 1.2T vertical coil compared to a 1.5T horizontal scanner. Both isolated leads and fully implanted systems were included. Result(s): We found 10- to 30-fold reduction in SAR implication at tips of isolated DBS leads, and up to 19-fold SAR reduction at tips of leads in fully implanted systems in vertical coils compared to horizontal birdcage coils. Conclusion(s): If confirmed in larger patient cohorts and verified experimentally, this result can open the door to plethora of structural and functional MRI applications to guide, interpret, and advance DBS therapy.

The dependence of phospholipid vesicle size on lipid composition is investigated by photon correlation spectroscopy. For each lipid composition prolonged ultracentrifugation was used to isolate a nearly uniform population of minimum-sized vesicles. The residual size variations in the samples were sufficient to cause polydispersity that made comparisons between samples difficult. Analyses of the data by the method of cumulants and by a method for approximating the particle size distributions directly are presented. The latter method made possible unambiguous comparisons that revealed small but systematic dependences of vesicle size on composition in vesicles containing mixtures of egg phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, egg phosphatidylcholine and beef brain sphingomyelin, and in single lipid vesicles of egg phosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, and beef brain sphingomyelin.

Recent studies have established that circadian alterations play an important role in the susceptibility to many human diseases, including cancer. Here we report that paternal irradiation in mice significantly affects the expression of genes involved in rhythmic processes in their first-generation offspring. Using microarrays, the patterns of gene expression were established for brain, kidney, liver and spleen samples from the non-exposed offspring of irradiated CBA/Ca and BALB/c male mice. The most over-represented categories among the genes differentially expressed in the offspring of control and irradiated males were those involved in rhythmic process, circadian rhythm and DNA-dependent regulation of transcription. The results of our study therefore provide a plausible explanation for the transgenerational effects of paternal irradiation, including increased transgenerational carcinogenesis described in other studies.",Excluded

Reapplication of aCTL immunoselective pressure to the IR clones, displaying a partial regain in sensitivity to aCTL after removal of the selective pressure, restored the resistance. The IR variants exhibited cross-resistance to non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted effector cells and gamma-irradiation, but not to carmustine. The IR clones were characterized for factors that might contribute to the immunoresistance. The aCTL adhesion to extracellular matrix extracts derived from either the IR clones or the parental cells was similar and not impaired. Furthermore, aCTL binding to parental cells and IR clones was equal. Down-regulation of the cell recognition molecules, class I HLA or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), that would inhibit their recognition by aCTL was not observed on the IR clones. The down-regulation of Fas by the IR clones correlated with their resistance to FasL-induced apoptosis. HLA-G or FasL that might provide an immunotolerant environment or provide a means of counterattack to aCTL, respectively, were not associated with the IR phenotype. The aCTL, coincubated with the IR clones and parental cells, displayed up-regulation of multiple secreted cytokines. A significant up-regulation of bioactive transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta was observed in the IR clones compared with the parental cells.

1390,"Superficial anatomy of the neonatal cerebrum - an ultrasonographic roadmap. Neurosonography is an essential imaging modality for assessing the neonatal brain, particularly as a screening tool to evaluate intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus and periventricular leukomalacia. The primary advantages of neurosonography include portability, accessibility and lack of ionizing radiation. Its main limitations are intrinsic operator dependence and the need for an open fontanelle. Neurosonographic imaging acquisition is typically performed by placing a sector transducer over the anterior fontanelle and following sagittal and coronal sweeps. The sensitivity of neurosonography has markedly improved thanks to the adoption of modern imaging equipment, the use of dedicated head probes, and the employment of advanced diagnostic US techniques. These developments have facilitated more descriptive identification of specific cerebral anatomical details, improving understanding of the cerebral anatomy by conventional US. Such knowledge is fundamental for enhanced diagnostic sensitivity and is a key to understanding pathological states. Furthermore, familiarity with normal anatomy is crucial for understanding pathological states. Our primary goal in this review was to supplement these technological developments with a roadmap to the cerebral landscape. We accomplish this by presenting a systematic approach to using routine US for consistent identification of the most crucial cerebral landmarks, reviewing their relationship with adjacent structures, and briefly describing their primary function.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the association between hippocampal dose and long-term neurocognitive function (NCF) impairment for benign or low-grade adult brain tumors treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult patients with benign or low-grade adult brain tumors were treated with FSRT per institutional practice. No attempt was made to spare the hippocampus. NCF testing was conducted at baseline and 18 months follow-up, on a prospective clinical trial. Regression-based standardized z scores were calculated by using similar healthy control individuals evaluated at the same test-retest interval. NCF impairment was defined as a z score <=-1.5. After delineation of the bilateral hippocampi according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group contouring atlas, dose-volume histograms were generated for the left and right hippocampi and for the composite pair. Biologically equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractions (EQD(2)) assuming an alpha/beta ratio of 2 Gy were computed. Fisher's exact test and binary logistic regression were used for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. Dose-response data were fit to a nonlinear model.RESULTS: Of 29 patients enrolled in this trial, 18 completed both baseline and 18-month NCF testing. An EQD(2) to 40% of the bilateral hippocampi >7.3 Gy was associated with impairment in Wechsler Memory Scale-III Word List (WMS-WL) delayed recall (odds ratio [OR] 19.3; p = 0.043).

Given that modern intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques can reduce the dose to the bilateral hippocampi below this dosimetric threshold, patients should be enrolled in ongoing prospective trials of hippocampal sparing during cranial irradiation to confirm these preliminary results.",Excluded
1393,"Hypothetical role of gravity in Rapid Eye Movements during sleep. Dream periods during sleep have been observed in most mammals as early in history as antiquity. Sleep researchers at the University of Chicago, discovered the phase of rapid eye movement (REM) during sleep and connected it to the dream period. During this period, called the REM phase (after the American terminology), although the brain shows electrical activity, it is insensitive to external stimulations, including light, sound, contact and, a little unexpectedly, gravity. However, since this discovery was made there has been no definitive explanation of the rapid eye movements Many possible explanations have been offered, and yet, the causes and contributing factors of the REM sleep phase are inadequately understood. It has often been proposed that the eyes observe the images produced during dreams, but researchers are not convinced. It is proposed here that the movements of the eyes during REM sleep are due to a feeling of disorientation and a subjective loss of landmarks. During the REM sleep phase, the brain has a reduced sensation of gravity, and the sleeper is in a state similar to weightlessness. The instinctive search for the vertical or horizontal direction triggers movements of the eyes, looking for usual points of reference. This hypothesis is reinforced by an original experiment that was conducted in space. The frequency of the eye movements of astronauts during their first night in space is 10 times more than what is experienced on the ground, and that moment in time is when the feeling or the sensation of weightlessness is certainly the most disturbing. Upon the return to Earth, the frequency of the eye movements increases again the first night after landing. These two moments are when the effects of gravity are felt most drastically. The present assumption needs to be validated experimentally and may necessitate further research.",Excluded

Aim: To observe the therapeutic efficacy and prognostic factors that influence survival rates in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with multiple brain metastases (BMs), (more than three and less than ten). Method(s): Retrospective analyses were conducted on the clinical data of 209 NSCLC patients with multiple BMs and were admitted to our hospital between March 2007 and November 2012. All BM patients received whole-brain radiotherapy. Two hundred patients received combined chemotherapy during the treatment process; 99 received targeted drug therapy; and nine got only symptomatic and supportive treatment. Survival time was defined as the period from the start of BM therapy to the patient's death or end of the follow-up period. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the median survival time, and the 6-month, 1-, and 2-year cumulative survival rates, as well as to plot the survival curves. The patients' cultural background included their socioeconomic status, level of education, their understanding of the disease, and the degree of care and support they received from their family members. Log-rank test was employed to test the differences in the survival rates between the subgroups. Cox multivariate regression analyses were used to analyze the various factors influencing the prognoses of NSCLC with multiple BMs. Result(s): The follow-up duration was between 1 and 87 months. The median survival time for all BM patients was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 9.37-14.83). The 6-month, 1-, and 2-year cumulative survival rates were 80%, 50.2%, and 10.7%, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that the independent factors influencing survival prognoses included Karnofsky Performance Status score, control of the primary lung tumor, interval between the confirmed diagnoses of lung cancer and BM, presence of extracranial metastasis, number of chemotherapy cycles undergone, Graded Prognostic Assessment class, administration of combined targeted drug therapy, the pathological type, and the cultural backgrounds of the patients. Multivariate analyses indicated that the number of chemotherapy cycles, administration of combined drug therapy, and patients' cultural background were key independent factors influencing survival prognoses. Conclusion(s): Active treatment of NSCLC with multiple BMs was beneficial, and the patients' cultural background had a strong influence on survival prognoses. Chemotherapy combined with targeted drug therapy could increase the patients' median and overall survival rates. The number of chemotherapy cycles undergone, administration of combined targeted drug therapy, and the cultural backgrounds of the patients had significant effects on the patients' survival prognoses.

Various factors predictive of the response to radiation therapy are described. While high (around 14 Gy) radiation therapy dose appears necessary for MF and should be started before the increase in transfusion need, huge splenomegalies should be excluded in regard to CML. As for other cases, the optimal dose is still unclear, but should probably be high enough, ie, around 10 Gy.CONCLUSION: To further study and better understand biological mechanisms underlying response to radiotherapy in patients with MF, prospective radio-chemotherapy phase II trials should be conducted in both CML and MF patients.",Excluded

Interestingly, excitatory GABAergic mPSCs also increase in amplitude through a process of synaptic scaling. Finally, the normal modulation of GABAergic mPSC amplitude was accelerated. Together, these compensatory responses appear to increase the excitability of the cord and could act to maintain appropriate SNA levels, thus demonstrating a distinct functional role for synaptic homeostasis. Because spontaneous network activity can regulate AMPAergic and GABAergic synaptic strength during development, SNA is likely to play an important role in a coordinated maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength.",Excluded
1399,"Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Functional Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta) Activity and Benefit of TGFbeta Inhibition in Irradiated Intracranial Tumors. Purpose: Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) promotes cell survival by endorsing DNA damage repair and mediates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, TGFbeta activation in response to radiation therapy is potentially targetable because it opposes therapeutic control. Strategies to assess this potential in the clinic are needed. Methods and Materials: We evaluated positron emission tomography (PET) to image <sup>89</sup>Zr -fresolimumab, a humanized TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, as a means to detect TGFbeta activation in intracranial tumor models. Pathway activity of TGFbeta was validated by immunodetection of phosphorylated SMAD2 and the TGFbeta target, tenascin. The contribution of TGFbeta to radiation response was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of mice bearing intracranial murine tumor models GL261 and SB28 glioblastoma and brain-adapted 4T1 breast cancer (4T1-BrA) treated with TGFbeta neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 1D11, and/or focal radiation (10 Gy). Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detected engineered, physiological, and radiation-induced TGFbeta activation, which was confirmed by immunostaining of biological markers. GL261 glioblastoma tumors had a greater PET signal compared with similar-sized SB28 glioblastoma tumors, whereas the widespread PET signal of 4T1-BrA intracranial tumors was consistent with their highly dispersed histologic distribution. Survival of mice bearing intracranial tumors treated with 1D11 neutralizing antibody alone was similar to that of mice treated with control antibody, whereas 1D11 improved survival when given in combination with focal radiation. The extent of survival benefit of a combination of radiation and 1D11 was associated with the degree of TGFbeta activity detected by PET. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that <sup>89</sup>Zr-fresolimumab PET imaging detects radiation-induced TGFbeta activation in tumors. Functional imaging indicated a range of TGFbeta activity in intracranial tumors, but TGFbeta blockade provided survival benefit only in the context of radiation treatment. This study provides further evidence that radiation-induced TGFbeta activity opposes therapeutic response to radiation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

1401,"Autophosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A. Ionizing radiation induces autophosphorylation of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase on serine 1981; however, the precise mechanisms that regulate ATM activation are not fully understood. Here, we show that the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) induces autophosphorylation of ATM on serine 1981 in unirradiated cells at concentrations that inhibit protein phosphatase 2A-like activity in vitro. OA did not induce gamma-H2AX foci, suggesting that it induces ATM autophosphorylation by inactivation of a protein phosphatase rather than by inducing DNA double-strand breaks. In support of this, we show that ATM interacts with the scaffolding (A) subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), that the scaffolding and catalytic (C) subunits of PP2A interact with ATM in undamaged cells and that immunoprecipitates of ATM from undamaged cells contain PP2A-like protein phosphatase activity. Moreover, we show that IR induces phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of PP2A from ATM and loss of the associated protein phosphatase activity. We propose that PP2A plays an important role in the regulation of ATM autophosphorylation and activity in vivo.",Excluded
1402,"Weiss Lecture. Effects of radiations of different qualities on cells: molecular mechanisms of damage and repair. Studies of ionizing radiations of different quality are discussed with particular emphasis on damage to DNA of mammalian cells. Three related themes are followed. Firstly, inactivation and mutation experiments with ultrasoft X-rays and slow heavy ions, coupled with theoretical analyses of the structures of the radiation tracks, have emphasized the biological importance of localized track features over nanometre dimensions. This led to the suggestion that the critical physical features of the tracks are the stochastic clusterings of ionizations, directly in or very near to DNA, resulting in clustered initial molecular damage including various combinations of breaks, base damages, cross-links, etc. in the DNA. The quantitative hypotheses imply that final cellular effects from high-LET radiations are dominated by their more severe, and therefore less repairable, clustered damage, and that these are qualitatively different from the dominant low-LET damage. Second, relative effectiveness of different types of radiation led to questions on the mechanisms of induction of chromosome exchanges. The high efficiency of ultrasoft X-rays, despite their very short track lengths, suggested that single sites of DNA damage may lead to exchanges by a molecular process involving interaction with undamaged DNA. Also it is shown that a single site-specific DNA break, introduced by restriction enzymes, sometimes leads to a large deletion when misrepaired by cell extracts. These deletions occur between short DNA repeats, and are therefore a form of 'illegitimate' recombination, but clearly do not involve the interaction of two damage sites. Third, it was shown that cells from patients with the radiosensitive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) lack a post-irradiation recovery process. The sensitivity of AT cells to high LET radiations was found to be reduced relative to that for normal cells, reinforcing the concept that high LET damage is less easy to repair. AT patients are prone to lymphoreticular cancers, and their cells show characteristic chromosomal rearrangements, which may be associated with misrepair at specific genomic sequences. Similarly, studies of radiation-induced leukaemia in the mouse have implicated rearrangement at specific interstitial chromosome sites, which are rich in telomere-like repeat sequences.

Campus), 53 patients with supratentorial astrocytoma grades 3 and 4 were treated with pions between 1982 and 1985. A 3-dimensional spot-scanning treatment technique has proven to be practical. The accuracy of the beam alignment system used for treatment was reproducible daily within 2 mm. Low pion flux has hindered optimal beam shaping but this will soon be remedied as flux improves. The overall median survival observed (53 patients) is 262 days from date of first radiation treatment. Younger (less than 49 years) patients have significantly better survival than older (greater than 50 years) patients (p = 0.001). From a base line dose of 40 Gy photons whole brain and 17.5 Gy pion boost, doses were escalated to 33 Gy pions localised to the primary tumour and the median survival improved from 198 to 436 days. Survival curves for patients treated with localised pion techniques to doses above 30 Gy are significantly better than for those treated with schedules of pions mixed with photons (p = 0.04). It appears that optimal pion dose for brain tumours is 33 Gy minimum with a possible maximum of 36 Gy and doses delivered in 15 fractions in 3 weeks.

Continuous irradiation in utero is reported to produce mental retardation and gross abnormalities of the brain in the human. A few experimental studies conducted so far also report gross brain defects in animals exposed to continuous irradiation in utero. Despite the increasing use of nuclear energy for power and radioisotopes in medicine, there is hardly any literature available on the effect of continuous irradiation on the structural details of the developing brain. After intraperitoneal injections of different doses of 131I (8, 18 and 32 microCi) and 32P (10 microCi) in new-born rats on the 6th postnatal day, cerebella stained by Golgi techniques were cut sagittally and the sections were examined on the 10th, 15th and 21st postnatal days.

The changes observed included persistence of the perisomatic processes beyond the 10th postnatal day, multiple primary dendrites, angulation of the primary dendrites, long segments of primary dendrites without branches and significantly reduced dendritic volume. The number of affected cells was less on the 21st postnatal day. The effective radiation dose estimated in these groups ranged from 15 to 26 rad. Since the rats irradiated with 6 rad had not shown such changes it is believed that there is a threshold dose of radiation beyond which only changes are perceptible at neuronal level.",Excluded

Results after heavy chemotherapy, total irradiation and autologous bone marrow transplantation. Fatal outcome. [French]. A 35-year-old woman in the process of acute, nonlymphoblastic transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) was treated with heavy chemotherapy, total irradiation and autologous bone marrow transplantation. Chemotherapy included thioguanine 700 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, cytosine-arabinoside 700 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, cyclophosphamide 180 mg/kg and CCNU (lomustine) 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. This was followed by total irradiation in doses of 8 grays (screened to 6 grays for the lungs) at the rate of 19 rad/min. The autologous bone marrow reinjected had been taken 13 months before the transformation (8 days after the end of busulfan treatment) and frozen using a suboptimal program. Cytogenetically, the chronic phase of CML was characterized by a 46 XX Phi +/46 XX Phi - mosaic. During transformation, 3 clones were evaluated on 25 mitoses: 46 XX Phi - (7 mitoses); 46 XX Phi + (12 mitoses), and 47 XX Phi + with additional C (6 mitoses). The course of the disease after treatment was marked by: (1) disappearance of blast cells; (2) disappearance of the 47 XX Phi + population specific of transformation and of the 46 XX Phi + population. A single, normal 46 XX Phi - population remained 3 months after the bone marrow transplantation: (3) return to normal granulocyte production. However, thrombocytopenia persisted and resulted in death from cerebral haemorrhage on the 95th day. No residual blast cell infiltration was detected on post-mortem. This case shows that a massive treatment arrest acute transformation of CML. It also suggests that because busulfan had provided selective advantages or because the freezing program had been suboptimal, or both, engraftment with the 46 XX Phi -component of the initial mosaic was only partial and incomplete. Finally, it may serve as a model for the management of acute CML transformation using bone marrow autografts.",Excluded

This study investigated safety and efficacy associated with check-point inhibitors (CPIs) concurrent with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) in melanoma patients with brain metastases. Materials/Methods: Prospectively collected data were analyzed from an IRB-approved registry of 428 patients with 2830 brain metastases treated with SRS from 2012-2015. Melanoma patients treated with SRS within 1 month of administration of a CPI were identified as being treated concurrently. Patients treated concurrently were matched 1:1 with a control group of melanoma patients treated with SRS alone. All patients had preand post-SRS T1-and T2-weighted MRIs. Categorical variables were compared with Fisher's exact tests, continuous variables with independent sample t-tests, and the log-rank test was used for survival and disease control analyses. Statistical tests were two-tailed, with the significance level set at a<0.05. Result(s): Twenty one melanoma patients with 104 brain metastases were treated concurrently with GKRS and a CPI. Ten patients were treated with Ipilimumab, ten with Pembrolizumab, and one with Nivolumab. Matched patients had no statistically significant differences in age, gender, performance status, extracranial disease burden, prior radiation, peri-SRS steroid use, number of brain lesions or total brain tumor volume treated. Patients treated with concurrent CPIs and SRS were significantly more likely to have any post-treatment increases in T1 post-contrast and T2-FLAIR volumes (52 vs 19%; P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in rates of adverse radiation effects, steroid use at follow-up, or decompressive craniotomies. There were also no significant differences in local control, distant brain failure, or rates of salvage whole brain radiation or SRS. There was a non-significant improvement in median overall survival (OS) with concurrent CPIs compared with matched controls (11.6 vs 8.8 months, P = 0.80) and a significantly longer median OS than predicted by Diagnosis-Specific GPA (DS-GPA) scores (11.6 vs 4.7 months, P = 0.05).1 Median OS for matched controls was not significantly different than that predicted by their DS-GPA scores.

1413,"CT and MR imaging in Hodgkin's disease - Present and future. Initial staging of Hodgkin's disease is crucial to determine the location and extent of disease, and is the hallmark for the choice of treatment. At present, the established radiological technique for staging Hodgkin's disease is computed tomography (CT). Modern multidetector row CT scanners allow fast imaging from the scull base to the groins during a single breath hold with a spatial resolution of approximately 1 mm. Both, nodal and extranodal involvement of Hodgkin's disease can be diagnosed with CT. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is another useful cross-sectional imaging modality for staging Hodgkin's disease. The development of fast MR imaging techniques has considerably reduced imaging time without compromising the quality of MR images. As a consequence, MR imaging is now considered to be as diagnostic as CT for staging Hodgkin's disease. The excellent soft-tissue contrast and the lack of exposure to ionizing radiation are the main advantages of MR imaging. For the detection of extranodal Hodgkin's disease, MR imaging is superior to assess involvement of the brain, the spinal cord and bone marrow; while CT allows excellent evaluation of lung disease. Common major problems in staging Hodgkin's disease are still the detection of nodal involvement in normal sized lymph nodes and residual tumor masses after therapy. In the future, newly developed lymphotropic contrast agents for MR imaging might be helpful to answer these questions. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.",Excluded
1414,"Short-arm human centrifugation with 0.4g at eye and 0.75g at heart level provides similar cerebrovascular and cardiovascular responses to standing. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Orthostatic intolerance continues to be a problem with astronauts upon return to Earth as a result of cerebral and cardiovascular adaptations to weightlessness. We tested the hypothesis that artificial gravity from a short-arm human centrifuge (SAHC) could provide cerebral and cardiovascular stimuli similar to upright posture and thereby serve as a suitable countermeasure.METHODS: We compared cardiovascular and cerebrovascular responses before, during, and after exposure to hyper-G with that of standing in healthy young participants. The head was positioned such that the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was 0.46 m from the center of rotation. Two levels of hyper-G that provided 1g and 2g at foot level were investigated. Continuous blood pressure, heart rate, calf blood volume, MCA mean blood flow velocity (MFV) and end-tidal CO2 were measured.RESULTS: Blood pressure at the level of the MCA (BP-MCA) and MFV was reduced during stand and at 2g. The relationship between MFV and BP-MCA at 2g was different from supine and similar to standing, while 1g centrifugation was not different from supine. The cardiovascular system was also not different from supine at 1g but was similarly challenged in 2g compared to stand.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that short-arm centrifugation 2g at the feet, with the head offset 0.5 m from the center, provides similar cardiovascular and cerebral responses to standing. This supports the hypothesis that passive 2g SAHC exposure at the feet could be used as a countermeasure for in-flight cardiovascular and cerebrovascular deconditioning.",Excluded

1417,"An exploration of the factor structure and development of potentially useful subscales of etiological beliefs about schizophrenia in a general population sample. Background: Given that accessing care, treatment engagement, and course and outcomes among people with schizophrenia may be influenced by beliefs about causes in the larger community, causal beliefs about schizophrenia have been studied in numerous communities around the world. In particular, the 30-item list of etiological attributions developed by Angermeyer and colleagues has been used to describe causal beliefs in patients, family members, and lay community members within such communities. The current study, the first examination of the latent or factorial structure of these 30 causal beliefs, seeks to provide informative subscales that may enhance reliability and validity of groupings of causes for future analyses involving community members. Method(s): Data were gathered from six separate surveys involving three distinct groups of individuals from the same community within the southeastern United States: lay community members, relatives of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and police officers at the start of a 1-week mental health training program. Result(s): Exploratory factor analysis in the overall sample (n = 577) revealed four factors that were used to define four subscales, termed: personal/family/social stressors (14 items), inconsistent with modern conceptions of risk (8 items), external/environmental insults to the brain (6 items), and consistent with modern biological conceptions (2 items). Cronbach's internal consistency reliability coefficients for these subscales were 0.91, 0.83, 0.71, and 0.65, respectively. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that subscales could be derived to provide continuous measures for assessing causal beliefs in order to study how this concept relates to attitudes toward schizophrenia, the people affected by the disorder, and treatments that are recommended by mental health professionals.

PURPOSE: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been applied to inoperable brain metastases in lung adenocarcinoma. Recently, an in vitro study showed reduced clonogenic survival of mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) lung cancer cell lines in response to ionizing radiation compared with that of the wild type. To elucidate the role of EGFR mutations in radiation treatment, we evaluated the clinical response to WBRT and survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastases.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of 63 patients with brain metastases from lung adenocarcinoma who were treated with WBRT. Demographic data, EGFR mutation status, response to WBRT, and survival data were collected. Clinical response was assessed 1 month after the start of WBRT. Univariate and logistic regression models were used to test potential predictive factors associated with clinical response. Log-rank test and Cox regression were analyzed to identify factors that affected survival.RESULTS: Clinical response to WBRT was observed in 29 patients (46%), with 34 nonresponder patients (54%). Patients with EGFR mutations had higher response rates to WBRT compared with those with the wild-type (54% versus 24%; P = 0.045). Both the administration of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (P = 0.034) and EGFR mutation (P = 0.029) were independently associated with response to WBRT.

1421,"Primary central nervous system lymphoma: Is there still a role for radiotherapy?. Purpose of Review: Adding high-dose methotrexate to whole-brain radiotherapy improves survival in primary central nervous system lymphoma. However, the high neurotoxicity rates observed, especially in the elderly, raised interest in exploring other alternatives such as reduced-dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy-only treatments. Recent Findings: Phase II studies suggested that omitting radiotherapy decreases progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival. A randomized phase III trial testing chemotherapy with/without radiation found similar results. However, interpretation of that trial has been difficult because of the chemotherapy regimen used (methotrexate with/without ifosfamide), intrinsic methodological problems and lack of neuropsychological evaluation. It also remains unclear whether chemotherapy-only treatments could ultimately result in worse cognitive outcomes in comparison with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy because the higher rates of relapses could result in additional neurotoxicity from salvage treatments and brain damage by relapsing tumor. Given differences in relapses and neurotoxicity rates according to age, it is also unclear how results apply to younger versus older patients. Summary: Given the lack of better data, omitting radiotherapy currently seems a justifiable choice in routine practice, particularly in the elderly, but the question remains unsettled. Ongoing studies are investigating other consolidation options, including reduced-dose radiotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue, aiming at improving disease control and decreasing neurotoxicity. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

Study of the patterns of the postradiation death of differentiating and proliferating cells in the subependymal zone of the rat brain. [Russian]. The post-irradiation cell kinetics was studied in vivo autoradiographically with 3H-thymidine, injected 60-80 minutes before the whole body X-irradiation of rats in doses of 50, 150 or 300 R. The wavy character of death was shown in the proliferating and differentiating rat's brain subependymal cells. After cell irradiation in G2- and S-phases four peaks of labeled mitotic cells with pycnotic nuclei (""mitotic death"") were recorded. The application of the double labelling technique with 3H- and 14C-thymidine showed that the lethally damaged cells irradiated in G1-phase had lost their ability to synthesize DNA. The nuclei of these cells became pycnotic later than 4 hours after irradiation, as follows indirectly from data recorded by Shmakova et al. (1972). The conformity in the time and alternation of the death peak appearance of differentiating cells and of the appearance of the death peaks and mitoses in proliferating cells enabled us to assume the persistence of the cycle (""short cycle"") in differentiating cells with the rhythm similar to that in the mitotic cycle. All the cells of the system were blocked during one hour, independently of the dose of irradiation, in one of six points of the cycle (mitotic cycle, short cycle).

BACKGROUND: Hypopituitarism is the most frequent complication after pituitary adenoma stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and is correlated with increasing radiation to the pituitary gland. Biological effective dose (BED) is a dosimetric parameter that incorporates a time component to adjust for mechanisms of deoxyribonucleic acid repair activated during treatment.OBJECTIVE: To assess mean gland BED as a predictor of post-SRS hypopituitarism, as compared to mean gland dose, in a contemporary cohort study of patients undergoing single-fraction SRS for pituitary adenoma.METHODS: Cohort study of 97 patients undergoing single-fraction SRS from 2007 to 2014. Eligible patients had no prior pituitary irradiation, normal pre-SRS endocrine function, and >24 mo of endocrine follow-up. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess mean gland dose and BED as predictors of new post-SRS hypopituitarism.RESULTS: Median post-SRS follow-up was 48 mo (interquartile range [IQR], 34-68). A total of 27 patients (28%) developed new hypopituitarism at a median 22 mo (IQR, 12-36). Actuarial rates of new endocrinopathy were 17% at 2 yr (95% CI 10%-25%) and 31% at 5 yr (95% CI 20%-42%). On univariate analysis, sex (P = .02), gland volume (P = .03), mean gland dose (P < .0001), and BED significantly predicted new hypopituitarism (P < .0001).

This human exposure study examined the relationship between field strength and biological response and tested whether the exposure levels at which the greatest effects occur differ for different endpoints. Three matched groups of 18 men each participated in two 6 h exposure test sessions. All subjects were sham exposed in one session. In the other session, each group of subjects was exposed at a different level of combined electric and magnetic field strength (low group:6 kV/m, 10 microT; medium group:9 kV/m, 20 microT; and high group: 12 kV/m, 30 microT). The study was performed double blind, with exposure order counterbalanced. Significant slowing of heart rate, as well as alternations in the latency and amplitude of event-related brain potential measures derived from the electro encephalogram (EEG), occurred in the group exposed to the 9 kV/m, 20 microT combined field (medium group). Exposure at the other field strength levels had no influence on cardiac measures and differential effects on EEG activity. Significant decrements in reaction time and in performance accuracy on a time estimation task were observed only in the low group. These results provide support for the hypothesis that humans may be more responsive to some combinations or levels of field strength than to others and that such differences in responsivity may depend, in part, on the endpoint of interest.",Excluded

A 66-year-old woman with a history of stage IA mixed endometrioid and serous endometrial cancer presented to our centre with 2 weeks of worsening headaches nearly 4 years after her initial surgery. At admission, she manifested bitemporal hemianopsia, difficulty walking and clinical and laboratory findings of panhypopituitarism, including diabetes insipidus. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a 2.7 cm sellar/suprasellar mass compressing the optic chiasm and infiltrating the pituitary stalk. Computerised tomography documented mediastinal, lung, adrenal and liver involvement, including a 2.5 cm palpable left supraclavicular node that on excisional biopsy demonstrated metastatic endometrial adenocarcinoma.

There is evidence that electromagnetic stimulation may accelerate the healing of tissue damage following ischemia. We undertook this study to investigate the effects of low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) exposure on cerebral injury in a rabbit model of transient focal ischemia (2 h occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion). PEMF exposure (280 V, 75 Hz, IGEA Stimulator) was initiated 10 min after the onset of ischemia and continued throughout reperfusion (six exposed, six controls). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology were used to measure the degree of ischemic injury. Exposure to pulsed electromagnetic field attenuated cortical ischemia edema on MRI at the most anterior coronal level by 65% (P < 0.001). On histologic examination, PEMF exposure reduced ischemic neuronal damage in this same cortical area by 69% (P < 0.01) and by 43% (P < 0.05) in the striatum. Preliminary data suggest that exposure to a PEMF of short duration may have implications for the treatment of acute stroke.",Excluded

The pre-irradiation sensori-neural hearing threshold at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz was used as a baseline for the individual patient, and the observed sensori-neural hearing loss (SNHL) was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-irradiation values. The pre-irradiation hearing level or patient age was not correlated with the actual SNHL. In contrast, there was a significant correlation between the total radiation dose to the inner ear and the observed hearing impairment. SNHL was most pronounced in the high frequencies, with values up to 35 dB (4000 Hz) and 25 dB (2000 Hz) in some patients. The latent period for the complication appeared to be 12 months or more.

Despite aggressive multimodal treatment approaches, the prognosis for patients with diffuse gliomas remains disappointing. Glioma cells often extensively infiltrate in the surrounding brain parenchyma, a phenomenon that helps them to escape surgical removal, radiation exposure and chemotherapy. Moreover, conventional therapy is often associated with considerable local and systemic side effects. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic approaches is essential to improve the outcome of these patients. Immunotherapy offers the opportunity to specifically target residual radio-and chemoresistant tumor cells without damaging healthy neighboring brain tissue. Significant progress has been made in recent years both in understanding the mechanisms of immune regulation in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as tumor-induced and host-mediated immunosuppression elicited by gliomas. In this review, after discussing the special requirements needed for the initiation and control of immune responses in the CNS, we focus on immunological phenomena observed in glioma patients, discuss different immunological approaches to attack glioma-associated target structures and touch on further strategies to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy of gliomas.

At 2 months post-irradiation, cellular markers of inflammation (total, activated, and newborn microglia) and neurogenesis (newborn neurons) were measured in 40 mum sections of the dentate gyrus (DG).RESULTS: Although the total number of microglia in the DG/hilus was not significantly different (p > 0.7) in unirradiated, single dose, and fWBI rats, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.003) increase in the percent-activated microglia; fWBI did not (p > 0.1). Additionally, single doses produced a significant (p < 0.002) dose-dependent increase in surviving newborn microglia; fWBI did not (p < 0.8). Although total proliferation in the DG was reduced equally by single and fWBI doses, single doses produced a significant dose-dependent (p < 0.02) decrease in surviving newborn neurons; fWBI did not (p > 0.6).CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the rat brain's cellular response to single doses often does not predict its cellular response to 'biologically equivalent' fWBI doses.",Included

The effect of fludarabine (9-beta-D-arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine-5'- monophosphate), an adenine nucleoside analogue, on the tolerance of the spinal cord to fractionated irradiation was studied in a rat model. Anesthetized female Fisher 344 rats received irradiation to 2 cm of the cervical spine with a telecobalt unit (dose rate 1.14 Gy/min). Radiation was administered in two, four or eight fractions spread over a 48-h period with or without fludarabine. Animals assigned to combined therapy received two daily intraperitoneal injections of fludarabine (150 mg/kg) given 3 h prior to the first daily radiation fraction. It was found that fludarabine reduced the iso-effect dose required to induce leg paresis at 9 months after irradiation for all fractionation schedules. Dose modification factors of 1.23, 1.29 and greater than 1.27 were obtained for two, four and eight fractions, respectively. Fitting the data with the direct analysis method of Thames et al. with an incomplete repair model [18] showed that the potentiating effect of fludarabine may be mediated through reduction in the number of 'tissue-rescuing units' (InK). Alpha and beta values were slightly but not significantly decreased, whereas the alpha/beta ratio was unchanged. These features suggest that fludarabine did not significantly inhibit cellular repair processes but rather reduced the spinal cord tolerance by a fixed additive toxic effect on the same target cells. In rodent models, the combination of fludarabine and fractionated radiation has previously been found to yield a therapeutic gain, i.e., the drug enhanced tumor response to a greater extent than it reduced normal tissue tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term effects on the ultrastructure of parotid glands after fractionated irradiation. The method implemented involved 5 x 6 Gy and 5 x 8 Gy, Monday to Friday 6 MV photons. By unilateral irradiation, the contralateral parotid gland served as a control. Although irradiation diminished the acinar cell density in light microscopic sections from 75 to 32% after 5 x 8 Gy of irradiation, ultrastructural morphometry could not detect any statistically significant differences in acinar cell size, nuclear size, nuclear density, granule area, mean granule size, or granule density. In general, greater differences were seen between rats receiving 30 or 40 Gy, on both the irradiated and the control size, than between the irradiated side and the control side. This was interpreted as due to differences in the nutritional state of the animals.

INTRODUCTION: Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with a minimally invasive approach (MIS TLIF) has become a very popular technique in the treatment of degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine, as it allows a decrease in muscle iatrogenic. However, iterative radiological controls inherent to this technique are responsible for a significant increase in exposure to ionizing radiation for the surgeon. New techniques for radiological guidance (O-arm navigation-assisted) would overcome this drawback, but this remains unproven.OBJECTIVES: To analyze the exposure of the surgeon to intraoperative X-ray during a MIS TLIF under fluoroscopy and under O-arm navigation-assisted.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the University Hospital of Lille from February to May 2013. Twelve patients underwent a MIS TLIF for the treatment of low-grade spondylolisthesis; six under standard fluoroscopy (group 1) and six under O-arm system (group 2). Passive dosimeters (rings and glasses) and active dosimeters for thorax were used to measure the radiation exposure of the surgeon.RESULTS: For group 1, the average time of fluoroscopy was 3.718 minutes (3.13-4.56) while no radioscopy was perform on group 2. For the first group, the average exposure dose was 12 muSv (5-20 muSv) on the thorax, 1168 muSv (510-2790 muSv) on the main hand and 179 muSv (103-486 muSv) on the lens. The exposure dose was measured zero on the second group.CONCLUSION: The maximum recommended doses can be reached, mainly for the lens.

The major goal of this study was to determine if treatment with the newly constructed plasmid vector for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (pGL1-TNF-alpha) could enhance the radiation-induced growth reduction of C6 rat glioma. In addition, two different forms of ionizing radiation (gamma-rays and protons) were utilized. Body and spleen mass, leukocyte blastogenesis, and flow cytometry analysis of cell populations in blood and spleen were performed to detect toxicity, if any, and to identify mechanisms that may correlate with the anti-tumor action of combination therapy. C6 tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice and allowed to become established before treatment initiation. pGL1-TNF-alpha was injected into the implanted tumors, which were then irradiated 16-18 hr later; each modality was administered three times over 8-9 days. The addition of pGL1-TNF-alpha significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of radiation (p < 0.05). The effect was more than additive, since pGL1-TNF-alpha alone did not slow tumor progression and radiation alone had only a modest effect. Administration of pGL1-TNF-alpha together with proton radiation resulted in tumor volumes that were 23% smaller than those following pGL1-TNF-alpha + gamma-ray treatment; a similar differential in tumor size was observed in the groups receiving only radiation. Body weights and blood and spleen cell analyses did not reveal treatment-related toxicity. High basal proliferation of blood leukocytes and increased B cell levels in the spleen were associated with pGL1-TNF-alpha + 60Co (gamma-radiation) or proton treatment. Overall, the results suggest that the pGL1-TNF-alpha/radiation combination is effective and safe under the conditions employed. This is the first study to combine gene and proton radiation therapy and to show, under controlled experimental conditions, that proton radiation may have a greater effect against malignant tumors compared to the same physical dose of gamma-radiation.",Excluded

This clock relies on several groups of neurons that express the Period (PER) protein, including the ventral lateral neurons (LN(v)s), which express the Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptide, and the PDF-negative dorsal lateral neurons (LN(d)s). In normal cycles of day and night, adult flies exhibit morning and evening peaks of activity; however, the contribution of the different clock neurons to the rest-activity pattern remains unknown. Here, we have used targeted expression of PER to restore the clock function of specific subsets of lateral neurons in arrhythmic per(0) mutant flies. We show that PER expression restricted to the LN(v)s only restores the morning activity, whereas expression of PER in both the LN(v)s and LN(d)s also restores the evening activity. This provides the first neuronal bases for 'morning' and 'evening' oscillators in the Drosophila brain. Furthermore, we show that the LN(v)s alone can generate 24 h activity rhythms in constant darkness, indicating that the morning oscillator is sufficient to drive the circadian system.",Excluded

Giant synapses between layer 5B (L5B) neurons of somatosensory (barrel) cortex and neurons of the posteromedial nucleus (POm) of thalamus reside in a key position of the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loop, yet their synaptic properties and contribution to CTC information processing remain poorly understood. Fluorescence-guided local stimulation of terminals were combined with postsynaptic whole-cell recordings in thalamus to study synaptic transmission at an identified giant synapse. We found large EPSCs mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and NMDA receptors. A single presynaptic electrical stimulus evoked a train of postsynaptic action potentials, indicating that a single L5B input can effectively drive the thalamic neuron. Repetitive stimulation caused strong short-term depression (STD) with fast recovery. To examine how these synaptic properties affect information transfer, spontaneous and evoked activity of L5B neurons was recorded in vivo and played back to giant terminals in vitro. We found that suprathreshold synaptic transmission was suppressed because of spontaneous activity causing strong STD of the L5B-POm giant synapse. Thalamic neurons only spiked after intervals of presynaptic silence or when costimulating two giant terminals. Therefore, STD caused by spontaneous activity of L5B neurons can switch the synapse from a ""driver mode"" to a ""coincidence mode.""

Purpose: We investigated the feasibility of using Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery for ""dose painting"" to deliver higher doses to residual or recurrent nodules and surgical cavity after resection of brain metastases. Methods and materials: Two integrated boost techniques were developed with GK. The single-target technique delineated both the surgical cavity (cavity) and gross disease (nodule) as a single target. Dose was prescribed to the target with the goal of covering the nodule with a higher dose. The 2-target technique delineated the cavity and nodule as separate target volumes, each prescribed to its own dose and planned separately. Two cases were used to illustrate each technique. The single-target technique was used to deliver 16 Gy to a smaller cavity (7 cm<sup>3</sup>) and a 20-Gy integrated boost to 2 nodules (case 1). The 2-target technique was used to deliver 12 Gy to a larger cavity (21.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) and 20 Gy to a single nodule (case 2). Result(s): For both cases, the cavity coverage with the prescribed dose was 100% with the standard plan and integrated boost techniques. For case 1, compared with a standard plan, the single-target technique improved the 20-Gy nodule coverage from 89.7% (nodule 1) and 97.9% (nodule 2) to 100% (both) and increased the minimum dose from 16.6 Gy to 20.8 Gy (nodule 1) and from 19.4 Gy to 20.8 Gy (nodule 2). For case 2, compared with a standard plan, the 2-target technique improved the 20-Gy nodule coverage from 4% to 100% and the minimum dose from 13.8 Gy to 21 Gy. Conclusion(s): Both GK integrated boost approaches allowed for effective delivery of higher doses to residual or recurrent nodules in a surgical cavity.

1449,"The role of systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases from small-cell lung cancer. Brain is the most common site of metastatic spread in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Approximately 10% of SCLC patients have brain metastases (BM) already at diagnosis and an additional 40% will develop central nervous system (CNS) involvement during their disease course. Although whole brain radiotherapy and corticosteroids is considered the treatment of choice, accumulating evidence suggests that systemic chemotherapy may also play an important role. The concept of the brain as a pharmacologic sanctuary site for established metastases is in contrast with recent clinical observations of frequent BM responses with systemic chemotherapy. During the last decade, several reports about the effect of systemic chemotherapy on BM from SCLC have been published. Pooled data from five studies report 66% response rate (RR) in 64 patients with initial BM. In addition, an average RR of 36% is derived from five studies including 135 patients with delayed BM treated with systemic single agent chemotherapy. Among new drugs with activity in patients with SCLC brain metastases, camptothecin analog topotecan is one of the most promising with a 52% RR. Although whole brain radiation remains the standard treatment of established BM in SCLC there is an emerging role for systemic chemotherapy, particularly with the use of new active drugs as part of combined modality treatments.

1450,"The spatial pattern of light determines the kinetics and modulates backpropagation of optogenetic action potentials. Optogenetics offers an unprecedented ability to spatially target neuronal stimulations. This study investigated via simulation, for the first time, how the spatial pattern of excitation affects the response of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expressing neurons. First we described a methodology for modeling ChR2 in the NEURON simulation platform. Then, we compared four most commonly considered illumination strategies (somatic, dendritic, axonal and whole cell) in a paradigmatic model of a cortical layer V pyramidal cell. We show that the spatial pattern of illumination has an important impact on the efficiency of stimulation and the kinetics of the spiking output. Whole cell illumination synchronizes the depolarization of the dendritic tree and the soma and evokes spiking characteristics with a distinct pattern including an increased bursting rate and enhanced back propagation of action potentials (bAPs). This type of illumination is the most efficient as a given irradiance threshold was achievable with only 6 % of ChR2 density needed in the case of somatic illumination. Targeting only the axon initial segment requires a high ChR2 density to achieve a given threshold irradiance and a prolonged illumination does not yield sustained spiking. We also show that patterned illumination can be used to modulate the bAPs and hence spatially modulate the direction and amplitude of spike time dependent plasticity protocols. We further found the irradiance threshold to increase in proportion to the demyelination level of an axon, suggesting that measurements of the irradiance threshold (for example relative to the soma) could be used to remotely probe a loss of neural myelin sheath, which is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases.",Excluded

1452,"Three-dimensional treatment planning of brain tumors: Advantages of the method and clinical results. [German]. Purpose: Radiotherapy became an important component in the treatment of brain gliomas. The aim of this study is to analyse several advantages of the three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy in comparison with a two- dimensional conventional technique and to present the clinical results of 43 patients with brain gliomas treated according to a three-dimensional planning. Patients and Method: Between January 1994 and December 1995, 43 Patients with malignant brain gliomas (WHO III and IV) were treated in our department according to a three-dimensional treatment planning. The patients received a total irradiation dose of 60 Gy, 2 Gy/day, 5 days/week. The rate of survival was analysed in relation with the known prognostical factors: histology, Karnofsky index, age, resection status. In 10 patients a three- dimensional treatment planning was compared with a conventional two- dimensional planning: the volume of the normal brain tissue irradiated to high dose levels (95% isodose) and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the brain by Kutcher and Lyman were comparatively analysed. Result(s): The survival rate for the whole group was 14 months. The histology of the tumor, age, Karnofsky index and resection status were important prognostical factors. The three-dimensional planning allows a 15 to 20% reduction in the volume of normal brain tissue irradiated to high dose levels (95% isodose). The NTCP is significantly lower using the three-dimensional technique (range 0.03% to 13%), in comparison with the two-dimensional conventional technique (range 0.1% to 26%). The value of NTCP increases with tumor volume. Conclusion(s): Concerning the tumor control and survival rate, the three-dimensional treatment planning shows no advantages compared to the standard conventional methods. The main advantage of the three-dimensional treatment planning is the possibility to spare normal brain tissue.

1456,"Monitoring Dynamic Morphological Changes with Electrocardiography-Gated Dynamic 4-Dimensional Computed Tomography Angiography to Predict Intraoperative Rupture of Intracranial Aneurysms. Objective This study aims to evaluate dynamic morphological changes of intracranial aneurysms to predict intraoperative aneurysm rupture (IAR) during clipping. Methods Included in this study were 153 patients, who had ruptured and microsurgical-clipped aneurysms. All patients underwent dual-source computed tomography examination of electrocardiography-gated dynamic 4-dimensional computed tomography angiography before clipping. Original scanning data were reconstructed to produce 20 data sets of cardiac cycles with 5% time intervals. The aneurysm neck, transverse and longitudinal diameters, and volume from the 20 groups of images were measured to calculate their respective change rates. In addition, other data and clinical characteristics were recorded. Data were analyzed by logistic regression to identify factors associated with IAR. Results Of the 153 patients, 24 patients experienced IAR. Multivariable analysis revealed that the aneurysm neck change rate (P = 0.0001; odds ratio, 1.276) and aspect ratio (height/neck ratio, P = 0.025; odds ratio, 2.387) are predictors for IAR. When the change rate was greater than or equal to 60%, and the sensitivity and specificity were 91.7% and 76.7%, respectively. Conclusions Aneurysm neck change rate is independent predictor of IAR.

1457,"Prospective trial evaluating difference in radiation target volume on 3T versus 1.5T mr for patients with malignant gliomas. Purpose/Objective(s): It is hypothesized that there is a difference in the peritumoral and tumor related signal abnormality detected by 1.5 tesla (T) versus 3T T2 FLAIR magnet resonance imaging (MRIs). We assessed the difference in radiation treatment gross tumor volumes (GTVs) defined by four investigators for high-grade gliomas as determined using 1.5T vs. 3T MRIs. Materials/Methods: A total of 23 patients with newly diagnosed, high grade-gliomas were enrolled in this IRB approved prospective trial. All patients underwent a 1.5T and 3T MR scans within a 24-hour period, with no treatment or steroid dose change between scans. The 1.5T study was part of the clinical standard of care and hence was the MR imaging with intravenous gadolinium administration and was used for radiation treatment planning. Gadolinium was not given at 3T imaging. The imaging parameters for T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were those that are clinically employed at this institution. Image processing and radiation planning was performed using radiation oncology software. MRIs were fused by a designated physicist and were reviewed by a radiation oncologist. GTV delineation was independently performed by 4 experienced investigators: 2 radiation oncologists and 2 neurosurgeons. To decrease inherent biases, investigators contoured 1.5T and 3T MRs separately, with a minimum of 72 hours between contours, blinded to other contours. GTV was defined by the extent of peritumoral edema depicted by high T2 FLAIR signal abnormality. For each patient and investigator the volumes defined by FLAIR images at 1.5 and 3T were determined and the ratio of the volumes (GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup>) were calculated. The mean volume ratios were calculated for each investigator as well as an overall average. To assess the consistency of contours from investigator to investigator, the standard deviations and range of the volumes amongst all investigators were determined for each patient at each field strength. Result(s): The volumes ratios for each investigator (GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup>) were 0.86 +/- 0.20 (range, 0.37-1.03), 0.90 +/- 0.20 (range, 0.19-1.08), 0.94 +/- 0.18 (range, 0.37-1.14), and 0.98 +/- 0.14 (range, 0.66-1.18). One patient was clearly an outlier, with 3T volumes 0.19 to 0.66 that of the 1.5T volumes. The overall GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup>ratio was 0.95 +/- 0.19. Excluding the outlier produced an overall GTV<sup>3T</sup>/GTV<sup>1.5T</sup> ratio 0.94 +/- 0.13 (range, 0.57-1.18). The 1.5T studies produced less variability from investigator to investigator. Thirty-nine percent of contoured volumes were different by greater than 10%. Conclusion(s): At this institution, it was found that flair defined GTVs for high grade gliomas were on average smaller that at 3T. There was increased volume variability on 3T MR.",Excluded
1458,"Isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage in mild traumatic brain injury: is a repeat CT scan necessary? A single-institution retrospective study. BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage (iSAH) is a common finding in the emergency department. In many centers, a repeat CT scan is routinely performed 24 to72 h following the trauma to rule out further radiological progression. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical utility of the repeat CT scan in clinical practice.METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of all patients who presented to our institution with mild TBI (mTBI) and isolated SAH between January 2015 and October 2017. CT scan at admission and control after 24 to 72 h were examined for each patient in order to detect any possible change. Neurological deterioration, antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy, coagulopathy, SAH location, associated injuries, and length of stay in hospital were analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 649 TBI patients, 106 patients met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-four patients were females and 52 were males with a mean age of 68.2 years. Radiological iSAH progression was found in 2 of 106 (1.89) patients, and one of them was under antiplatelet therapy. No neurological deterioration was observed. Ten of 106 (9.4%) patients were under anticoagulation therapy, and 28 of 106 (26.4%) were under antiplatelet therapy.CONCLUSION: ISAH in mTBI seems to be a radiological stable entity over 72 h with no neurological deterioration. The clinical utility of a repeat head CT in such patients is questionable, considering its radiation exposure and cost. Regardless of anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy, neurologic observation and symptomatic treatment solely could be a reasonable alternative.",Excluded
1459,"Fractionated radiosurgery for painful spinal metastases: DOSIS - a phase II trial. BACKGROUND: One third of all cancer patients will develop bone metastases and the vertebral column is involved in approximately 70% of these patients. Conventional radiotherapy with of 1-10 fractions and total doses of 8-30 Gy is the current standard for painful vertebral metastases; however, the median pain response is short with 3-6 months and local tumor control is limited with these rather low irradiation doses. Recent advances in radiotherapy technology - intensity modulated radiotherapy for generation of highly conformal dose distributions and image-guidance for precise treatment delivery - have made dose-escalated radiosurgery of spinal metastases possible and early results of pain and local tumor control are promising. The current study will investigate efficacy and safety of radiosurgery for painful vertebral metastases and three characteristics will distinguish this study. 1) A prognostic score for overall survival will be used for selection of patients with longer life expectancy to allow for analysis of long-term efficacy and safety. 2) Fractionated radiosurgery will be performed with the number of treatment fractions adjusted to either good (10 fractions) or intermediate (5 fractions) life expectancy. Fractionation will allow inclusion of tumors immediately abutting the spinal cord due to higher biological effective doses at the tumor - spinal cord interface compared to single fraction treatment. 3) Dose intensification will be performed in the involved parts of the vertebrae only, while uninvolved parts are treated with conventional doses using the simultaneous integrated boost concept.METHODS / DESIGN: It is the study hypothesis that hypo-fractionated image-guided radiosurgery significantly improves pain relief compared to historic data of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Primary endpoint is pain response 3 months after radiosurgery, which is defined as pain reduction of >= 2 points at the treated vertebral site on the 0 to 10 Visual Analogue Scale. 60 patients will be included into this two-centre phase II trial.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study will refine the methods of patient selection, target volume definition, treatment planning and delivery as well as quality assurance for radiosurgery. It is the intention of this study to form the basis for a future randomized controlled trial comparing conventional radiotherapy with fractionated radiosurgery for palliation of painful vertebral metastases.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01594892.",Excluded
1460,"Dosimetric consequences of translational and rotational errors in frame-less image-guided radiosurgery. BACKGROUND: To investigate geometric and dosimetric accuracy of frame-less image-guided radiosurgery (IG-RS) for brain metastases.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Single fraction IG-RS was practiced in 72 patients with 98 brain metastases. Patient positioning and immobilization used either double- (n = 71) or single-layer (n = 27) thermoplastic masks. Pre-treatment set-up errors (n = 98) were evaluated with cone-beam CT (CBCT) based image-guidance (IG) and were corrected in six degrees of freedom without an action level. CBCT imaging after treatment measured intra-fractional errors (n = 64). Pre- and post-treatment errors were simulated in the treatment planning system and target coverage and dose conformity were evaluated. Three scenarios of 0 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm GTV-to-PTV (gross tumor volume, planning target volume) safety margins (SM) were simulated.RESULTS: Errors prior to IG were 3.9 mm +/- 1.7 mm (3D vector) and the maximum rotational error was 1.7degree +/- 0.8degree on average. The post-treatment 3D error was 0.9 mm +/- 0.6 mm. No differences between double- and single-layer masks were observed. Intra-fractional errors were significantly correlated with the total treatment time with 0.7 mm +/- 0.5 mm and 1.2 mm +/- 0.7 mm for treatment times <=23 minutes and >23 minutes (p<0.01), respectively. Simulation of RS without image-guidance reduced target coverage and conformity to 75% +/- 19% and 60% +/- 25% of planned values. Each 3D set-up error of 1 mm decreased target coverage and dose conformity by 6% and 10% on average, respectively, with a large inter-patient variability. Pre-treatment correction of translations only but not rotations did not affect target coverage and conformity. Post-treatment errors reduced target coverage by >5% in 14% of the patients. A 1 mm safety margin fully compensated intra-fractional patient motion.CONCLUSIONS: IG-RS with online correction of translational errors achieves high geometric and dosimetric accuracy. Intra-fractional errors decrease target coverage and conformity unless compensated with appropriate safety margins.",Excluded
1461,"[Acoustic neuroma in Iceland for 30 years (1979-2009)]. INTRODUCTION: Acoustic neuroma (AN) is a tumor of the 8th cranial nerve. The goal of this study was to find the incidence of AN in Iceland from 1979 - 2009 as well as investigate other epidemiological factors.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group of patients with the AN diagnosis was gathered retrospectively through medical records. We looked at several epidemiological factors including age and symptoms at diagnosis, and the treatment chosen for each individual.RESULTS: The incidence rate of AN in Iceland is 1.24/100,000. About 10% of diagnosed tumors were found incidentally. Most of those were found in the last 10 years of the investigation and in that period fewer large and giant tumors at diagnosis. Present complaints of patients at diagnosis were hearing loss (69%), dysequilibrium/dizziness (47%) and tinnitus (43%). Treatments were surgery (n=47), observation (n=30) and gamma knife radiosurgery (n=16). We had information concerning postoperative hearing loss and facial paralysis in 39 patients who underwent surgery. Loss of hearing postoperatively occurred in 69% (n=27) and 44% (n=17) had facial paralysis. For an average of 3.5 years, 17% of tumors followed by imaging grew.CONCLUSION: The incidence of AN is similar to that in Europe and is increasing. More tumors are found incidentally. Small tumors can be followed by regular imaging, at least for the short term. Larger tumors are treated by surgery or gamma knife radiosurgery. A high percentage of patients receiving surgery lost their hearing postoperatively.",Included
1462,"Differential radiosensitivity of neurons and neuroglia of the hippocampus in the adult rabbit. Adult rabbits were subjected to 4.5 Gy of whole-blody or brain alone gamma-irradiation, and their hippocampus was examined with the light and electron microscope. Pycnotic cells were found at the base of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in the so-called subgranular zone, as soon as 3 h after irradiation, and were cleared up by active phagocytosis after 48 h. Some of these cells appeared as undifferentiated, whereas others were differentiating granule cells, and possibly immature neuroglia. The extent of cell necrosis was contingent upon the age of the animal, the oldest animal studied (27 months) showing only sparse lesion of that type. Astrocytes and microglia were responsible for the phagocytosis of dead cells. Another type of lesion was found in the nuclei of the mature granule cells and consisted of light spots which appeared 1 h after the irradiation and disappeared almost completely after 48 h. Pyramidal cells did not show any of these two lesions. It is concluded that the laterations in the electrical activity of pyrimidal cells, following irradiation, are at least partly due to lesions affecting the dentate gyrus. Radionecrosis in the subgranular zone is related to the presence of immature cells in this region.",Included
1463,"Subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of young rabbits as a secondary matrix. A high-resolution autoradiographic study. Cell genesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of 2-month-old rabbits has been investigated. After incorporation of tritiated thymidine, electron microscopic autoradiography allowed description of the ultrastructure of the cells labelled and the progressive transformation of these cells into granular neurons to be followed. Quantitative evaluation of the time course of this transformation has been performed by light microscope autoradiography using 1-micrometer sections. Precursor cells, labelled initially with 3H-thymidine, were transformed after 5 days into early neuroblasts, these cells in turn giving rise to neurons some 8 days later. At the latest time period examined (42 days), 80% of the labelled cells were neurons; more than 10% remained as precursor cells. It is suspected that the latter may behave as reserve cells. Small numbers of glial cells, astrocytes, and microglia, scattered throughout the hilus of the dentate gyrus and the molecular layer, were found labelled, and it is possible that they arise from a different precusor pool. It is concluded that the subgranular zone functions as a secondary matrix for granule neurons of the dentate gyrus in young rabbits. These late-forming and apparently synaptically uncommitted neurons may be recruited during the development and refinement of postnatal behavioral substrates, by one or other of the dominant afferent systems.",Excluded
1464,"Impact of concomitant systemic treatments on toxicity and intracerebral response after stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in combination with systemic therapies (ST) for brain metastases (BM).METHODS: Ninety-nine patients (171 BM) received SRT and concurrent ST (group 1) and 95 patients (131 BM) received SRT alone without concurrent ST (group 2). SRT was planned on a linear accelerator, using volumetric modulated arc therapy. All ST were allowed including chemotherapy (CT), immunotherapy (IT), targeted therapy (TT) and hormonotherapy (HT). Treatment was considered to be concurrent if the timing between the drug administration and SRT did not exceed 1 month. Local control (LC), freedom for distant brain metastases (FFDBM), overall survival (OS) and radionecrosis (RN) were evaluated.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11.9 months (range 0.7-29.7), there was no significant difference between the two groups. However, patients who received concurrent IT (n = 30) had better 1-year LC, OS, FFDBM but a higher RN rate compared to patients who did not: 96% versus 78% (p = 0.02), 89% versus 77% (p = 0.02), 76% versus 53% (p = 0.004) and 80% versus 90% (p = 0.03), respectively. In multivariate analysis, concurrent IT (p = 0.022) and tumor volume < 2.07 cc (p = 0.039) were significantly correlated with improvement of LC. The addition of IT to SRT compared to SRT alone was associated with an increased risk of RN (p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: SRT delivered concurrently with IT seems to be associated with improved LC, FFDBM and OS as well as with a higher rate of RN.",Excluded
1465,Acute effects of X irradiation on membrane potential and membrane resistance of snail neurones. [German]. Acute X irradiation of the metacerebral giant neurons of Helix pomatia above 1000 R or 3.4 kR/min (dose or dose rate threshold) leads to a significant reduction of the membrane potential. After blocking the afferent excitatory synapses the radiation depolarizations are strongly decreased but not completely suppressed. Long time irradiation at high dose rates and after the blocking of afferent synapses produced a depolarization in 2 phases: an immediate quick depolarization of about 10 mV is followed by a much slower decrease of the membrane potential. Substitution of extracellular sodium by tris ions suppresses the quick depolarization phase. The input resistance of the cell shows a transient increase at the begin of irradiation followed by a substantial decrease. These results are discussed in view of the possible mechanisms of radiation induced permeability changes in excitable membranes.,Included

Rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential but often difficult, as neurological manifestations are rarely disease specific.

1467,"Radiation injury to the temporal bone. Osteoradionecrosis of the temporal bone is an unusual sequela of radiation therapy to the head and neck. Symptoms occur many years after the radiation is administered, and progression of the disease is insidious. Hearing loss (sensorineural, conductive, or mixed), otalgia, otorrhea, and even gross tissue extrusion herald this condition. Later, intracranial complications such as meningitis, temporal lobe or cerebellar abscess, and cranial neuropathies may occur. Reported here are five cases of this rare malady representing varying degrees of the disease process. They include a case of radiation-induced necrosis of the tympanic ring with persistent squamous debris in the external auditory canal and middle ear. Another case demonstrates the progression of radiation otitis media to mastoiditis with bony sequestration. Further progression of the disease process is seen in a third case that evolved into multiple cranial neuropathies from skull base destruction. Treatment includes systemic antibiotics, local wound care, and debridement in cases of localized tissue involvement. More extensive debridement with removal of sequestrations, abscess drainage, reconstruction with vascularized tissue from regional flaps, and mastoid obliteration may be warranted for severe cases.

1468,"Circadian and photic regulation of immediate-early gene expression in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus. The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus is the site of an endogenous circadian clock synchronized by daily light-dark cycles. At some daily phases, light exposure both shifts the clock and alters the expression of several immediate-early genes in cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We have studied both spontaneous circadian and light-induced expression of several immediate-early gene messenger RNAs and proteins in hamsters in constant darkness or in response to brief light exposure. There was no detectable spontaneous expression of NGFI-A messenger RNA in suprachiasmatic nucleus cells at any circadian phase, but light pulses induced its expression selectively during the subjective night, with highest levels of expression 6 h into the night. We also found that there are two independent rhythms of expression of junB messenger RNA and JunB protein, as well as c-fos messenger RNA and c-Fos protein, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of hamsters: a rhythm of photic sensitivity expressed throughout the night and a spontaneous rhythm of expression triggered around dawn. Induction of NGFI-A messenger RNA and c-fos messenger RNA and c-Fos protein in response to a light pulse were found throughout the suprachiasmatic nucleus, with the highest levels of expression in the ventrolateral subdivision; however, the spontaneous expression of JunB and c-Fos proteins was confined mainly to the dorsomedial suprachiasmatic nucleus. The temporal and anatomical differences in the expression of these immediate-early genes in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus suggest that their protein products may be involved in different signaling mechanisms mediating either photic entrainment or endogenous oscillations within distinct subpopulations of suprachiasmatic nucleus cells.",Excluded
1469,"Ocular and cerebral hemo-fluid dynamics in microgravity: A mathematical model. Purpose: Long-term exposure to microgravity is known to lead to visual impairment in many astronauts (VIIP syndrome). Upper body fluid shift, alterations in intraocular pressure (IOP), intracranial pressure (ICP), tissue biomechanics and blood flow are among the many factors hypothesized to contribute to VIIP. Due to the difficulty to single out each of these factors using in-vivo studies, we present a mathematical model to theoretically evaluate the interactions between fluid flows and pressures in the brain (blood, cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid) and eyes (blood and aqueous humor) and their possible mechanical implications in VIIP. Method(s): We propose a 0-dimensional (0d) mathematical model of fluid circulation in the eyes and brain, embedded into a 0d whole-body circulation model. The model includes retinal, choroidal and ciliary circulations in the eyes. As suggested in the literature, the effect of microgravity is accounted for by i) considering zero hydrostatic pressure, ii) imposing zero central venous pressure, iii) decreasing the blood/aqueous humor oncotic pressure difference (iv) increasing the blood-brain barrier permeability. The model simulates microgravity-induced fluid redistribution in the upper body vasculature and variations in IOP and ICP, which are critical factors for VIIP. Result(s): The model predicts that, in microgravity conditions, ICP and IOP increase (Fig1a) and ocular blood flow decreases markedly in the choroid and ciliary circulations (Fig1b). Blood flow in the retina is found to experience smaller variations, owing to a purely mechanical perfusion control mechanism mainly enacted by the intraocular venous segments. Conclusion(s): The model suggests that i) the venous segments play a fundamental role in controlling pressures and fluxes in the ocular circulation, owing to the possibility of their collapse, and ii) the retinal circulation is less susceptible to microgravity-induced alterations than choroid and ciliary. These findings point towards further clinical assessment of ocular venous function in microgravity as a potential determinant factor for VIIP.",Excluded
1470,"Pulsed reduced dose rate re-irradiation (PRDR) using modulated arc (MARC) IMRT for recurrent gliomas: Initial clinical outcomes of a novel technique. Introduction: Limited salvage options exist for patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors after standard treatment. Pulsed reduced dose rate re-irradiation (PRDR) is a biologically-unique strategy that lowers the effective dose rate, potentially decreasing toxicity by allowing for greater sublethal damage repair in normal tissue. It has been shown to be safe and effective in patients with recurrent gliomas using a 3DRT technique. We developed a novel technique using PRDR with modulated arc (mARC) IMRT delivery to further reduce the amount of normal tissue exposed. We report our initial clinical results using mARC PRDR in patients with previously-irradiated recurrent gliomas. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all brain tumor patients treated with mARC PRDR at our Institution. All mARC PRDR plans were generated with Monaco (Elekta Inc) using 1/10 of the total prescription dose. For each treatment fraction a total of 10 identical treatment beams were delivered with a minimum time interval of 3 min between beam initiations. This technique allows for the entire treatment volume to receive exactly 1/10 of the prescription dose every 3 min while limiting the prescription dose rate to less than 0.0667 Gy/min. Result(s): A total of 34 patients were treated with mARC PRDR. Primary histology included grade 2 (nZ6), grade 3 (nZ10), and grade 4 (nZ15) gliomas. Median dose at initial RT was 60 Gy (range 48 e 70) at 1.8 e 2 Gy per fraction. Patients were heavily pre-treated with a mean of 3 prior recurrences (range 1 e 7) before PRDR. Nineteen patients had repeat resection at recurrence including 6 just prior to PRDR. Bevacizumab was previously given to 16 patients with 26 patients receiving bevacizumab while undergoing PRDR (dose 10 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg q2 weeks). All patients had a KPS of 70 or greater. Mean age at PRDR was 53 (range 3 e 71). Median interval between initial RT and PRDR was 4.75 years (range 0.5 e 18.3). Median total dose was 54 Gy (range 30 e 60) at 2 Gy per fraction. At a mean follow-up of 9.3 months (range 0.5 - 19.3), 6-month OS was 70.5% and 1-year was OS 23.5%. Median time to progression was 6 months with 6-month PFS 47% and 1-year PFS 17.6%. Five of the 34 patients did not finish treatment due to clinical decline and/or tumor progression. No acute G3 toxicities were seen from PRDR. Conclusion(s): This is the first clinical report of mARC IMRT PRDR for recurrent gliomas. This technique appears to be safe, feasible, and welltolerated for previously-irradiated patients with recurrent gliomas. We await long-term clinical data to better define efficacy and toxicity.",Excluded

The most widely used clinical application of MRS has been in the evaluation of central nervous system disorders. MRS has its limitations and is not always specific but, with good technique and in combination with clinical information and conventional MRI, can be very helpful in diagnosing certain entities. For example, a specific pattern of metabolites can be seen in disorders such as Canavan's disease, creatine deficiency, and untreated bacterial brain abscess.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Permanent night-shift workers may develop shift-work disorder (SWD). In the current study, we evaluated neurophysiological and behavioral indices of distractibility across times prior to the night shift (T1), during night hours (T2), and after acute sleep deprivation (T3) in permanent hospital night workers with and without SWD.METHODS: Ten asymptomatic night workers (NW) and 18 NW with SWD participated in a 25-h sleep deprivation study. Circadian phase was evaluated by dim-light salivary melatonin onset (DLMO). Objective sleepiness was evaluated using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Electrophysiological distractibility was evaluated by brain event-related potentials (ERP), whereas behavioral distractibility was evaluated by performance on a visual task in an auditory-visual distraction paradigm.STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Comparisons of ERP results were performed by repeated-measures analysis of variance, and t-tests were used where appropriate. A Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of variables (MLST, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and DLMO) that deviated from normal.RESULTS: First, in the SWD group, the reorienting negativity ERP amplitude was significantly attenuated compared to that in the NW group. Second, the SWD group had shorter MSLT during night shift hours (4.8 +/- 4.9 min) compared to that in NW (7.8 +/- 3.7 min; U = 47; z = -2.1; P < 0.03). Third, NW with SWD had a DLMO at 20:27 +/- 5.0 h, whereas healthy NW had a DLMO at 05:00 +/- 3.4 h (U = 43.5; z = -2.22, P < 0.03). Finally, acute sleep deprivation impaired behavioral performance and the P3a ERP in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate specific deficits in neurophysiological activity in the attentional domain among the shift-work disorder group relative to night workers.",Excluded
1475,"Effectiveness of Radiation Protection Caps for Lowering dose to the Brain and the Eye Lenses. Purpose: This work was designed to study the effectiveness of radiation protection caps in lowering the dose to the brain and the eye lens during fluoroscopically guided interventions. Material(s) and Method(s): Two types of radiation protection caps were examined with regards to their capacity to lower the radiation dose. One cap is equipped with lateral flaps, the other one is not. These caps were fitted to the head of an anthropomorphic Alderson-Rando (A.-R.) phantom. The phantom was positioned aside an angiographic table simulating the position of the first operator during a peripheral arterial intervention. One of the brain slices and both eyes of the A.-R. phantom were equipped with thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs). Result(s): The analysis of the data showed that the cap without lateral flaps reduced the dose to the brain by 11,5-27,5 percent depending on the position within the brain. The cap with lateral protection flaps achieved a shielding effect between 44,7 and 78,9 percent. When evaluating the dose to the eye, we did see an increase of dose reduction from 63,3 to 66,5 percent in the left eye and from 45,8 to 46,8 percent in the right eye for the cap without lateral protection. When wearing the cap with lateral protection we observed an increase of dose reduction from 63,4 to 67,2 percent in the left eye and from 45,8 to 50,0 percent in the right eye. Conclusion(s): Radiation protection caps can be an effective tool to reduce the dose to the brain and the eyes.

The complications that occurred in 89 patients during transportation and conventional head CT scanning at the Department of Radiology were studied prospectively. These complications were compared with the ones that occurred during mobile CT scanning in 50 patients in the NICU. The duration of the procedures was recorded, and an estimation of the staff workload was made. Two patient groups, defined as high- and medium-risk cases, were studied. Medical and/or technical complications occurred during conventional CT scanning in 25% and 20% of the patients in the high- and medium-risk groups, respectively. During mobile CT scanning complications occurred in 4.3% of the high-risk group and 0% of the medium-risk group. Mobile CT scanning also took significantly less time, and the estimated personnel cost was reduced. Conclusions. Mobile CT scanning in the NICU is safe. It minimizes the risk of physiological deterioration and technical mishaps linked to intrahospital transport, which may aggravate secondary brain injury. The time that patients have to remain outside the controlled environment of the NICU is minimized, and the staff's workload is decreased.",Excluded
1477,"H2O2-Sensitive Isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1 Act in Bitter-Sensing Gustatory Neurons to Promote Avoidance of UV During Egg-Laying. The evolutionarily conserved TRPA1 channel can sense various stimuli including temperatures and chemical irritants. Recent results have suggested that specific isoforms of Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1) are UV-sensitive and that their UV sensitivity is due to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. However, whether such UV sensitivity served any physiological purposes in animal behavior was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms promote avoidance of UV when adult Drosophila females are selecting sites for egg-laying. First, we show that blind/visionless females are still capable of sensing and avoiding UV during egg-laying when intensity of UV is high yet within the range of natural sunlight. Second, we show that such vision-independent UV avoidance is mediated by a group of bitter-sensing neurons on the proboscis that express H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms. We show that these bitter-sensing neurons exhibit dTRPA1-dependent UV sensitivity. Importantly, inhibiting activities of these bitter-sensing neurons, reducing their dTRPA1 expression, or reducing their H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity all significantly reduced blind females' UV avoidance, whereas selectively restoring a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive isoform of dTRPA1 in these neurons restored UV avoidance. Lastly, we show that specifically expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson in these bitter-sensing neurons promotes egg-laying avoidance of red light, an otherwise neutral cue for egg-laying females. Together, these results demonstrate a physiological role of the UV-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms, reveal that adult Drosophila possess at least two sensory systems for detecting UV, and uncover an unexpected role of bitter-sensing taste neurons in UV sensing.",Excluded

The circadian clock and sleep are essential for human physiology and behavior; deregulation of circadian rhythms impairs health and performance. Circadian clocks and sleep evolved to adapt to Earth's environment, which is characterized by a 24-hour light-dark cycle. Changes in gravity load, lighting and work schedules during spaceflight missions can impact circadian clocks and disrupt sleep, in turn jeopardizing the mood, cognition and performance of orbiting astronauts. In this review, we summarize our understanding of both the influence of the space environment on the circadian timing system and sleep and the impact of these changes on astronaut physiology and performance.",Excluded
1479,"Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes From Repeat Whole-brain Radiation Therapy for Brain Metastases in the Age of Stereotactic Radiosurgery. OBJECTIVES: Repeating whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with progressive/recurrent brain metastases is controversial. We retrospectively reviewed our experience of repeat WBRT in an era where stereotactic radiosurgery was also available.METHODS: In our IRB-approved database, 49 patients received repeat WBRT from 1996 to 2011. Median initial dose of WBRT was 30 Gy in 10 fractions (range, 27 to 37.5 Gy); median reirradiation dose was 20 Gy in 10 fractions (range, 14 to 30 Gy). Median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) at reirradiation was 70 (range, 40 to 90). Median number of discrete lesions at reirradiation was 6 (range, 1 to 30). Median interval between initial diagnosis of brain metastases and relapse requiring repeat WBRT was 11.5 months (range, 1.5 to 49.2 mo). Overall survival and relapse-free survival were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare outcomes between groups.RESULTS: Ninety percent of patients completed repeat WBRT. Median survival after repeat WBRT was 3 months (95% CI, 1.9-4.0). Thirteen patients had improved neurological symptoms (27%), 12 were stable (24%), and 14 had worsening symptoms (29%). On radiographic follow-up of 22 patients, 10 (46%) were improved, 4 (18%) were stable, and 8 (36%) progressed. Improved neurological symptoms after repeat WBRT and higher KPS at first follow-up were associated with improved survival (P=0.05 and 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: Repeat WBRT was well tolerated. Modest survival times are seen. Prognostic factors for survival include improved neurological symptoms after repeat WBRT and higher KPS at first follow-up. Repeat WBRT may be useful to improve neurological symptoms in patients with limited treatment options, especially those who are not appropriate stereotactic radiosurgery candidates.",Excluded

1481,"Disease-related microstructural differences in the brain in females with localized provoked vulvodynia. Localized provoked vulvodynia (LPVD) affects almost 15% of females and is characterized by localized sensitivity of the vulvar vestibule. Very little research has been performed to characterize central abnormalities in LPVD using neuroimaging. The few studies that are available indicate that neural alterations may play a causal role in symptom generation or are secondary responses to the chronic pain condition. The aim of the study was to utilize diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to identify unique microstructural differences in the brain. We compare LPVD to HCs to assess whether alterations in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), which are measures of cohesive axonal orientation and tissue compactness, are specific to pain, and with IBS to determine distinct or shared mechanisms with another chronic pelvic-pain disorder. Structural and DTI MRIs were conducted in a sample of 58 age-matched premenopausal females. FA and MD were processed using the FMBRIB Diffusion Toolbox. Voxelwise and ICBM atlas based region of interest analyses were performed using pairwise t-tests with age as a covariate. LPVD vs. HC: Patients with LPVD demonstrated significantly higher FA in brainstem regions including the left superior cerebellar peduncle as well as the medial lemniscus. There were also higher FA values in frontal lobe connections, right internal capsule, right corona radii, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, and primary sensory and motor regions. Higher MD was observed within the cingulum bundle and left anterior limb of internal capsule. LPVD vs. IBS: FA and MD differences between LPVD and IBS patients were less extensive and only localized to regions near the right posterior corona radiata and left posterior thalamic radiation. The significant group-related microstructural differences in deep gray matter structures included regions that are associated with sensorimotor tasks and cognitive-emotional tasks, suggesting increased processing and modulation of sensory and endogenous pain modulatory systems in LPVD.",Excluded
1482,"Treatment of Asymptomatic Meningioma with Gamma Knife Radiosurgery: Long-Term Follow-up with Volumetric Assessment and Clinical Outcome. BACKGROUND: Some patients are diagnosed with asymptomatic meningioma(s) after undergoing a screening CT and MRI for minor ailments or postresection. OBJECTIVE(S): To help clinicians in decision making for treatment of asymptomatic meningiomas. METHOD(S): A single center retrospective cohort study of 117 patients with 122 tumors treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS; Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Patients were followed with longitudinal imaging and clinical evaluations. Tumor volumetry and developments of new signs or symptoms after GKRS were the end points in the study. RESULT(S): Median patient age at GKRS was 60 yr (range 21-86 yr) with a median clinical follow-up of 53 mo (range 20-252 mo). The median pre-GKRS tumor volume was 3.6 +/- 3.8 cc (+/-standard deviation). Tumors were treated with a median margin dose of 14 +/- 2 Gy. At last follow-up, median tumor volume was 2.5 +/- 3.6 cc. Radiological progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 97% and 94.4% at 5 yr and 10 yr, respectively. Clinical PFS rates were 86% and 70% at 5 yr and 10 yr, respectively. Development of neurological complications was seen in 21 (18%) patients, and 11 (52%) of them had undergone surgical resection prior to GKRS. CONCLUSION(S): GKRS is a reasonable treatment strategy for asymptomatic meningiomas and compares favorably to natural history studies in terms of tumor control and neurological preservation. It results in relatively low morbidity in previously untreated meningiomas and serves as an appealing alternative treatment modality for recurrent meningiomas in asymptomatic patients.

1483,"Radiation Induced Metabolic Alterations Associate With Tumor Aggressiveness and Poor Outcome in Glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is uniformly fatal with a 1-year median survival, despite best available treatment, including radiotherapy (RT). Impacts of prior RT on tumor recurrence are poorly understood but may increase tumor aggressiveness. Metabolic changes have been investigated in radiation-induced brain injury; however, the tumor-promoting effect following prior radiation is lacking. Since RT is vital to GBM management, we quantified tumor-promoting effects of prior RT on patient-derived intracranial GBM xenografts and characterized metabolic alterations associated with the protumorigenic microenvironment. Human xenografts (GBM143) were implanted into nude mice 24 hrs following 20 Gy cranial radiation vs. sham animals. Tumors in pre-radiated mice were more proliferative and more infiltrative, yielding faster mortality (p < 0.0001). Histologic evaluation of tumor associated macrophage/microglia (TAMs) revealed cells with a more fully activated ameboid morphology in pre-radiated animals. Microdialyzates from radiated brain at the margin of tumor infiltration contralateral to the site of implantation were analyzed by unsupervised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In pre-radiated animals, metabolites known to be associated with tumor progression (i.e., modified nucleotides and polyols) were identified. Whole-tissue metabolomic analysis of pre-radiated brain microenvironment for metabolic alterations in a separate cohort of nude mice using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR revealed a significant decrease in levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC)), NAD<sup>+</sup>, Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates, and rise in energy carriers (ATP, GTP). GSH and ASC showed highest Variable Importance on Projection prediction (VIPpred) (1.65) in Orthogonal Partial least square Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA); Ascorbate catabolism was identified by GC-MS. To assess longevity of radiation effects, we compared survival with implantation occurring 2 months vs. 24 hrs following radiation, finding worse survival in animals implanted at 2 months. These radiation-induced alterations are consistent with a chronic disease-like microenvironment characterized by reduced levels of antioxidants and NAD<sup>+</sup>, and elevated extracellular ATP and GTP serving as chemoattractants, promoting cell motility and vesicular secretion with decreased levels of GSH and ASC exacerbating oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest IR induces tumor-permissive changes in the microenvironment with metabolomic alterations that may facilitate tumor aggressiveness with important implications for recurrent glioblastoma. Harnessing these metabolomic insights may provide opportunities to attenuate RT-associated aggressiveness of recurrent GBM.",Excluded
1484,"Long-term survival in AIDS-related primary central nervous system lymphoma. Background. The optimal therapeutic approach for patients with AIDS-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (AR-PCNSL) remains undefined. While its incidence declined substantially with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), AR-PCNSL remains a highly aggressive neoplasm for which whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is considered a standard first-line intervention. Methods. To identify therapy-related factors associated with favorable survival, we first retrospectively analyzed outcomes of AR-PCNSL patients treated at San Francisco General Hospital, a public hospital with a long history of dedicated care for patients with HIV and AIDS-related malignancies. Results were validated in a retrospective, multicenter analysis that evaluated all newly diagnosed patients with AR-PCNSL treated with cART plus high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX). Results. We provide evidence that CD4+ reconstitution with cART administered during HD-MTX correlates with long-term survival among patients with CD4 <100. This was confirmed in a multicenter analysis which demonstrated that integration of cART regimens with HD-MTX was generally well tolerated and resulted in longer progression-free survival than other treatments. No profound differences in immunophenotype were identified in an analysis of AR-PCNSL tumors that arose in the pre-versus post-cART eras. However, we detected evidence for a demographic shift, as the proportion of minority patients with AR-PCNSL increased since advent of cART Conclusion. Long-term disease-free survival can be achieved in AR-PCNSL, even among those with histories of opportunistic infections, limited access to health care, and medical non-adherence. Given this, as well as the long-term toxicities of WBRT, we recommend that integration of cART plus first-line HD-MTX be considered for all patients with AR-PCNSL. Copyright © The Author(s) 2016.

Method(s): All patients (Pts) underwent maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant RT 60 Gy in 30 fractions. After 2004, pts underwent chemoradiation with daily Temozolomide TMZ) (75 mg/m2) and maintenance TMZ (150-200 mg/m2 D1-D5) for a total of six cycles. An event was described as death for overall survival, progression/ recurrence of disease, or neuro-deterioration for progression free survival. Log-rank test was used to compare event-free survival (EFS) distribution. Result(s): Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (range-19-77). 39 patients were male and 17 patients were female with a male: female ratio of 2.3:1. Headache was the commonest symptom seen in 56.4% patients followed by seizures (53.8%) and motor deficit (12.8%).Median duration of symptoms was 8.5 months. Frontal location was most common in 66% of the patients followed by temporal and parietal location (12.5% each). 46(82.1%) patients had pure anaplastic ODG histology while 10(17.9%) patients had mixed anaplastic oligodendroglial tumor. 29(51.8%) patients underwent a gross total excision while others underwent a subtotal resection or a biopsy only.

PURPOSE: Proton MRSI is a noninvasive modality capable of generating volumetric maps of in vivo tissue metabolism without the need for ionizing radiation or injected contrast agent. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging has been shown to be a viable imaging modality for studying several neuropathologies. However, a key hurdle in the routine clinical adoption of MRSI is the presence of spectral artifacts that can arise from a number of sources, possibly leading to false information.METHODS: A deep learning model was developed that was capable of identifying and filtering out poor quality spectra. The core of the model used a tiled convolutional neural network that analyzed frequency-domain spectra to detect artifacts.RESULTS: When compared with a panel of MRS experts, our convolutional neural network achieved high sensitivity and specificity with an area under the curve of 0.95. A visualization scheme was implemented to better understand how the convolutional neural network made its judgement on single-voxel or multivoxel MRSI, and the convolutional neural network was embedded into a pipeline capable of producing whole-brain spectroscopic MRI volumes in real time.CONCLUSION: The fully automated method for assessment of spectral quality provides a valuable tool to support clinical MRSI or spectroscopic MRI studies for use in fields such as adaptive radiation therapy planning.",Excluded

Group I was the control group and not exposed to EMF. Group II and III were exposed to low level EMF (3.68 +/- 0.36 V/m) at 2.45 GHz MWR for 1 hour/day for 30 consecutive days.

1491,"Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated is not required for p53 induction and apoptosis in irradiated epithelial tissues. The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (Atm) protein kinase is a central regulator of the cellular response to DNA damage. Although Atm can regulate p53, it is not known if this Atm function varies between tissues. Previous studies showed that the induction of p53 and apoptosis by whole-body ionizing radiation varies greatly between tissue and tumor types, so here we asked if Atm also had a tissue-specific role in the ionizing radiation response. Irradiated Atm-null mice showed impaired p53 induction and apoptosis in thymus, spleen, and brain. In contrast, radiation-induced p53, apoptosis, phosphorylation of Chk2, and G(2)-M cell cycle arrest were slightly delayed in Atm(-/-) epithelial cells of the small intestine but reached wild-type levels by 4 h. Radiation-induced p53 and apoptosis in Atm(-/-) hair follicle epithelial cells were not impaired at any of the time points examined. Thus, Atm is essential for radiation-induced apoptosis in lymphoid tissues but is largely dispensable in epithelial cells.

1492,"Changes in the vestibular function during space flight. An analysis of observations and investigations carried out in space flight has shown that some cosmonauts and astronauts have experienced vestibular disorders during the transition to weightlessness. Vestibular-sensory disorders include: Spatial illusions (the feelings of falling down, being in an upside-down position, the sensations of rotation of the craft or the body) and vertigo occurring during the onset of the orbital flight and head movements; Feelings, similar to those experienced in response to Coriolis accelerations on the Earth, which occasionally develop in weightlessness during the spacecraft rotation upon abrupt head and body movements and restrained feet; Feelings ""of the load on the vestibular analyser which is unlike any Earth-bound effects"" upon abrupt head movements during the first hours of an orbital flight and ""a prolonged movement"" during the switch-off of thrusters in weightlessness. Vestibular-vegetative disorders comprise a complex of symptoms similar to those of motion sickness: loss of appetite, stomach awareness (12%), hypersalination, nausea (9.6%) and vomiting (4.8%). Soviet studies suggest that the vestibular tolerance to the flight effects depends on the natural stability and training to the cumulative effect of adequate vestibular stimuli. This has been used in the development of the system of vestibular selection. Changes in the vestibular function seem to play the major role in the development of motion sickness in weightlessness, extra-labyrinthine factors being contributory. The current hypotheses have not yet been adequately confirmed in experiments. A detailed physiological analysis allows the conclusion that the decisive factor in the development of motion sickness may be the disturbance of the function of analysers responsible for spatial orientation which take the form of sensory conflicts as well as an altered reactivity of the organism due to the hemodynamic rearrangement.

1496,"SPECT image segmentation for estimation of tumour volume and activity concentration in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE radionuclide therapy. Background: Dosimetry in radionuclide therapy has the potential to allow for a treatment tailored to the individual patient. One therapeutic radiopharmaceutical where patient-specific dosimetry is feasible is <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE, used for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours. The emission of gamma photons by <sup>177</sup>Lu allows for imaging with SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). One important step for dosimetry using this imaging technique is the SPECT image segmentation, which needs to be robust and accurate for the estimated quantities to be reliable. This work investigates different methods for automatic tumour delineation in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE SPECT images. Three segmentation methods are considered: a fixed 42% threshold (FT), the Otsu method (OM) and a method based on Fourier surfaces (FS). Effects of including resolution compensation in the iterative SPECT image reconstruction are also studied. Evaluation is performed based on Monte Carlo-simulated SPECT images from 24 h and 336 h post injection (p.i.), for determination of the volume, activity concentration and dice similarity coefficient. In addition, patient data are used to investigate the correspondence of tumour volumes when delineated in SPECT or morphological CT or MR images. Patient data are also used to examine the sensitivity to the operator-dependent initialization. Result(s): For simulated images from 24 h p.i. reconstructed without resolution compensation, a volume and activity-concentration root-mean-square error below 15% is typically obtained for tumours above approximately 10 cm<sup>3</sup> when using OM or FS, while FT performs considerably worse. When including resolution compensation, the tumour volume becomes underestimated and the activity concentration overestimated. The FS method appears to be robust to noise, as seen for the 336 h images. The differences between the tumour volumes estimated from the SPECT images and the volumes estimated from morphological images are generally larger than the discrepancies seen for the simulated data sets. Conclusion(s): Segmentation results are encouraging for future dosimetry of tumours with volumes above approximately 10 cm<sup>3</sup>. Using resolution compensation in the reconstruction may have a negative effect on volume estimation. Copyright © 2017, The Author(s).",Excluded
1497,"Use of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay to measure radiation-induced chromosome damage in lymphoblastoid cell lines. To establish the optimal experimental conditions for the use of the micronuclei (MN) test to determine the level of chromosomal damage induced by ionising radiation (IR) exposure in lymphoblastoid cell lines, a time-course study was performed comparing a normal and an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cell line, the latter being characterised by an extreme radiation sensitivity. Several parameters were analysed: the use of cytochalasin-B (Cyt-B) to quantify MN, the optimum fixation time to measure radiation-induced MN, the most appropriate treatment dose of IR to distinguish between the normal and the radiosensitive cells and the cell-cycle distribution after irradiation. The results obtained showed that the spontaneous as well as the radiation-induced levels of MN were significantly higher in the AT cell compared to the normal cells (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). In both cell types the number of radiation-induced MN were lower in the cultures without Cyt-B than those with Cyt-B (P < 0.001), with the AT cells being distinguished in terms of IR-induced MN from the normal cells only with the addition of Cyt-B. The level of MN formation was independent of the dose of Cyt-B used (3 or 6 microg/ml). The optimum time for radiation-induced MN measured was found to be between 48 and 72 h post-irradiation, with 2 and 4 Gy exposures inducing similar levels of MN. However, as the higher dose caused a greater delay in the cell-cycle, treatment with 2 Gy with MN measurement at 48 h in the presence of 3 microg/ml Cyt-B were chosen as the optimum experimental conditions. This choice was validated using two additional normal and AT cell lines. In conclusion, our results show that the use of Cyt-B increases the sensitivity of the MN test for comparing differences in radiosensitivity between lymphoblastoid cell lines.",Excluded

Human behavioral studies have shown that nitrous oxide, in subanesthetic concentrations, impairs psychomotor function, cognitive performance, and learning and memory processes. However, the cerebral mechanisms of such effects remain unknown. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to map the brain areas associated with nitrous oxide effects. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in eight volunteers, during room air (control) or 20% nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide) inhalation using 15(O)-water, to reflect regional neuronal activity. To control for the possibility that 20% nitrous oxide uncoupled cerebral blood flow and metabolism, in four of the subjects, regional cerebral metabolic rate (rCMR) was also measured using 18F-deoxyglucose during the two experimental conditions. Results of rCBF and rCMR scans were compared between conditions using the statistical parametric mapping method, and areas of nitrous oxide-related activation or deactivation were identified at a significance level of 0.005. Percent changes in rCBF scan pixels from these activated or deactivated areas were then compared with those of stereotactically corresponding rCMR scan pixels with t statistics (P < 0.05 was defined as a significant difference). It was found that cerebral blood flow and metabolism were not uncoupled by 20% nitrous oxide, since percent changes in rCBF and rCMR, detected during nitrous oxide inhalation, did not differ significantly from each other (P < 0.05). Nitrous oxide inhalation was associated with significant activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a limbic area known to mediate psychomotor and cognitive processes. Deactivation was found in the posterior cingulate, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and visual association cortices in both hemispheres; the former two regions are known to mediate learning and memory. These areas identified by PET in vivo may provide the neuroanatomical basis for the behavioral responses associated with subanesthetic nitrous oxide inhalation.",Excluded

We have compared 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein (Hsc70) isolated from bovine brain with recombinant wild type protein and mutant E543K protein (previously studied as wild type in our laboratory). Wild type bovine and recombinant protein differ by posttranslational modification of lysine 561 but interact similarly with a short peptide (fluorescein-labeled FYQLALT) and with denatured staphylococcal nuclease-(Delta135-149).

ATP hydrolysis rates of the wild type proteins are enhanced 6-10-fold by the addition of peptide. The E543K mutant has a peptide-stimulated hydrolytic rate similar to that of wild type protein but a higher unstimulated rate, yielding a mere 2-fold enhancement. All three versions of Hsc70 possess similar ATP-dependent conformational shifts, and all show potassium ion dependence. These data support the following model: (i) in the presence of K+, Mg2+, and ATP, the peptide binding domain inhibits the ATPase; (ii) binding of peptide relieves this inhibition; and (iii) the E543K mutation significantly attenuates the inhibition by the peptide binding domain and destabilizes Hsc70-peptide complexes.",Excluded
1503,"Complete homonymous hemianopia due to cerebral infarction of the lateral geniculate body: A case report with diffusion tensor image findings. Background: The human lateral geniculate body (LGB) is the thalamic visual center linking the retina to the striate cortex. The human LGB has dual blood supplies from the anterior choroidal artery of the internal carotid artery and the lateral posterior choroidal artery of the posterior cerebral artery. Thus, complete homonemous hemianopia caused by cerebral infarction of the LGB is extremely rare. Case Report: A 63-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus presented due to a sudden visual field defect. He had no other vascular risk factors or focal neurological deficits. Five days later, complete right homonymous hemianopia was detected by Humphrey automated perimetry. Brain MRI and DWI revealed an infarction at the left LGB. MRA revealed no obstruction or stenosis. Diffusion tensor image (DTI) showed decreased fractional anisotrophy value in the left occipital subcortical area (right, 0.436; left, 0.384). The density of optic radiation decreased more on the right side in tractography than on the left side. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Quadruple sectoranopia can be caused by lesions in the medial and lateral portions of the LGB which are supplied by the anterior choroidal artery. The lateral posterior choroidal artery supplies the central part of the LGB. Thus, occlusion of this artery produces a wedge-shaped homonymous hemianopsia or horizontal sectoranopia. However, despite the LGB lesion, our patient showed a complete homonemous hemianopia probably due to involvement of the whole LGB through occlusion of a variant vessel that supplied the whole LGB rather than simultaneous occlusion of 2 vessels. The patient's DTI findings were well consistent with his clinical features.",Excluded
1504,"Nontraumatic vascular emergencies: Imaging and intervention in acute occlusion. Risk factors for acute venous occlusion range from prolonged immobilization to hypercoagulability syndromes, trauma, and malignancy. The aim of this review article is to illustrate the different imaging options for the diagnosis of acute venous occlusion and to assess the value of interventional strategies for venous thrombosis treatment in an emergency setting. First, diagnosis and treatment of the most common form of venous occlusion, at the level of the lower extremities, is presented, followed by pelvic vein and inferior vena cava occlusion, mesenteric venous thrombosis, upper extremity occlusion, acute cerebral vein thrombosis, and finally acute venous occlusion of hemodialysis access. In acute venous occlusion of the lower extremity phlebography is still the reference gold standard. Presently, duplex ultrasound with manual compression is the most sensitive and specific noninvasive test. Limitations of ultrasonography include isolated distal calf vein occlusion, obesity, and patients with lower extremity edema. If sonography is non-diagnostic, venography should be considered. Magnetic resonance venography can differentiate an acute occlusion from chronic thrombus, but because of its high cost and limited availability, it is not yet used for the routine diagnosis of lower extremity venous occlusion only. Regarding interventional treatment, catheter-directed thrombolysis can be applied to dissolve thrombus in charily selected patients with symptomatic occlusion and no contraindications to therapy. Acute occlusion of the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava, often due to extension from the femoropopliteal system, represents a major risk for pulmonary embolism. Color flow Doppler imaging is often limited owing to obesity and bowel gas. Venography has long been considered the gold standard for identifying proximal venous occlusion. Both CT scanning and MR imaging, however, can even more accurately diagnose acute pelvis vein or inferior vena cava occlusion. MRI is preferred because it is noninvasive, does not require contrast agent, carries no exposure to ionizing radiation, and is highly accurate and reproducible. Apart from catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy has proven to be a quick and safe treatment modality by enabling the recanalization of thrombotic occlusions in conjunction with minimal invasiveness and a low bleeding risk. Mechanical thrombectomy devices should only be used in conjunction with a temporary cava filter. Contrast-enhanced CT is at present considered the examination of choice for acute mesenteric vein occlusion which has mortality rates as high as 80%. Patients with proven acute mesenteric venous occlusion and contraindications to surgical therapy and no identified bleeding disposition without looming bowel ischemia or infarction are possible contenders to the less invasive percutaneous approach either by (in)direct thrombolysis or mechanical means. Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of upper extremity thrombosis. Computed tomography and MRI are in addition helpful in diagnosing central chest vein occlusions. The interventionalist is rarely involved in the treatment of this entity. Catheter-directed thrombolysis is known to improve lysis rates. Together with balloon angioplasty good results have been obtained. If stenosis or thrombus remains after thrombolysis and angioplasty, stent placement should follow. Within the first two weeks, thrombosed dural sinus and cerebral venous vessels are typically hyperdense on CT compared with brain parenchyma; after the course of 2 weeks, the thrombus will become isodense. In MRI an axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, an axial diffusion-weighted MRI, coronal T1-weighted spinecho and T2-weighted turbo-spinecho sequences, a coronal gradientecho and a 3D phase-contrast venous angiogram should be performed. Local thrombolysis is needed only when patients have an exacerbation of clinical symptoms or imaging signs of worsening disease despite sufficient anticoagulation therapy. Acute occlusions of dialysis grafts and fistulae are a frequently encountered complication. Among the various methods described for acute occlusion screening, ultrasonography and MRI have been proven to be accurate and noninvasive; however, if immediate treatment can be anticipated, imaging should be performed directly by digital subtraction angiography before the percutaneous intervention. Initial percutaneous thrombectomy is very effective with success rates and patency rates comparable to those of surgical thrombectomy. A short thrombosis can be treated with balloon angioplasty alone, whereas an extensive thrombosis requires a combination of mechanical devices and/or thrombolytic agents with adjunctive balloon angioplasty.",Excluded
1505,"Defining the role of palliative radiotherapy in bone metastasis from primary liver cancer: An analysis of survival and treatment efficacy. Aims and background. Primary liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is still associated with a poor prognosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma are known to cause bone metastasis resulting in pain, neurologic impairment and risk of fracture. Palliative radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in symptomatic bone lesions and is usually performed as percutaneous fractionated radiotherapy. Methods and study design. From June 1987 to December 2009, 41 patients (median age, 64 years) with bonemetastasis received radiotherapy in our department. The analyzed patients were treated for 67 sites of bone lesions. We analyzed the applied fractionation schedules and the preferred sites of metastasis and symptoms, evaluated the therapeutic outcome in terms of symptomatic improvement, and described the prognosis of these patients. Results. Main indication for palliative radiotherapy was pain in 94% of all cases.Most frequent radiation protocols were 10 x 3 Gy (20 patients) and 20 x 2 Gy (19 patients). Median applied overall dose was 39 Gy (range, 4-48 Gy) and median single dose was 2.5 Gy (range, 1.8-4 Gy). The median duration of the radiotherapeutic treatment was 15 days (range, 2-24 days) and in 12 cases treatment was discontinuated. The overall response rate to palliative radiotherapy in bone metastasis was 77%. Median overall survival in both cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma patients was 4.2 months after initiation of radiotherapy (range, 0.2-38.9). Conclusions. Considering the poor prognosis of patients with bone metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, with a poor median survival of 3.7-5.0 months according to our study and existing literature, shorter radiotherapy schedules or even single-fraction irradiation can be considered.",Excluded
1506,"AT cells are not radiosensitive for simple chromosomal exchanges at low dose. Cells deficient in ATM (product of the gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia patients) or NBS (product of the gene mutated in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome) show increased yields of both simple and complex chromosomal aberrations after high doses (>0.5Gy) of ionizing radiation (X-rays or gamma-rays), however less is known on how these cells respond at low dose. Previously we had shown that the increased chromosome aberrations in ATM and NBS defective lines was due to a significantly larger quadratic dose-response term compared to normal fibroblasts for both simple and complex exchanges. The linear dose-response term for simple exchanges was significantly higher in NBS cells compared to wild type cells, but not for AT cells. However, AT cells have a high background level of exchanges compared to wild type or NBS cells that confounds the understanding of low dose responses. To understand the sensitivity differences for high to low doses, chromosomal aberration analysis was first performed at low dose-rates (0.5Gy/d), and results provided further evidence for the lack of sensitivity for exchanges in AT cells below doses of 1Gy. Normal lung fibroblast cells treated with KU-55933, a specific ATM kinase inhibitor, showed increased numbers of exchanges at a dose of 1Gy and higher, but were similar to wild type cells at 0.5Gy or below. These results were confirmed using siRNA knockdown of ATM. The present study provides evidence that the increased radiation sensitivity of AT cells for chromosomal exchanges found at high dose does not occur at low dose.",Excluded
1507,"Combined modality therapy including intraoperative electron irradiation for locally recurrent colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: To evaluate survival, relapse patterns, and prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer relapse treated with curative-intent therapy, including intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: From April 1981 through January 2008, 607 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer received IOERT as a component of treatment. IOERT was preceded or followed by external radiation (median dose, 45.5 Gy) in 583 patients (96%). Resection was classified as R0 in 227 (37%), R1 in 224 (37%), and R2 in 156 (26%). The median IOERT dose was 15 Gy (range, 7.5-30 Gy).RESULTS: Median overall survival was 36 months. Five- and 10-year survival rates were 30% and 16%, respectively. Survival estimates at 5 years were 46%, 27%, and 16% for R0, R1, and R2 resection, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that R0 resection, no prior chemotherapy, and more recent treatment (in the second half of the series) were associated with improved survival. The 3-year cumulative incidence of central, local, and distant relapse was 12%, 23%, and 49%, respectively. Central and local relapse were more common in previously irradiated patients and in those with subtotal resection. Toxicity Grade 3 or higher partially attributable to IOERT was observed in 66 patients (11%). Neuropathy was observed in 94 patients (15%) and was more common with IOERT doses exceeding 12.5 Gy.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival and disease control was achievable in patients with locally recurrent colorectal cancer. Continued evaluation of curative-intent, combined-modality therapy that includes IOERT is warranted in this high-risk population.",Excluded
1508,"Stereotactic radiosurgery combined with targeted/ immunotherapy in patients with melanoma brain metastasis. BACKGROUND: There is limited data on the use of targeted or immunotherapy (TT/IT) in combination with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with melanoma brain metastasis (MBM). Therefore, we analyzed the outcome and toxicity of SRS alone compared to SRS in combination with TT/IT.METHODS: Patients with MBM treated with single session SRS at our department between 2014 and 2017 with a minimum follow-up of 3 months after first SRS were included. The primary endpoint of this study was local control (LC). Secondary endpoints were distant intracranial control, radiation necrosis-free survival (RNFS), and overall survival (OS). The local/ distant intracranial control rates, RNFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to test differences between groups. Cox proportional hazard model was performed for univariate continuous variables and multivariate analyses.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (17 male and 11 female) with 52 SRS-lesions were included. The median follow-up was 19 months (range 14-24 months) after first SRS. Thirty-six lesions (69.2%) were treated with TT/IT simultaneously (4 weeks before and 4 weeks after SRS), while 16 lesions (30.8%) were treated with SRS alone or with sequential TT/IT. The 1-year local control rate was 100 and 83.3% for SRS with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.023), respectively. The estimated 1-year RNFS was 90.0 and 82.1% for SRS in combination with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.935). The distant intracranial control rate after 1 year was 47.7 and 50% for SRS in combination with TT/IT and SRS alone (p = 0.933). On univariate analysis, the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment including the BRAF status (Melanoma-molGPA) was associated with a significantly improved LC. Neither gender nor SRS-PTV margin had a prognostic impact on LC. V10 and V12 were significantly associated with RNFS (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004).CONCLUSION: SRS with simultaneous TT/IT significantly improved LC with no significant difference in radiation necrosis rate. The therapy combination appears to be effective and safe. However, prospective studies on SRS with simultaneous TT/IT are necessary and ongoing.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The institutional review board approved this analysis on 10th of February 2015 and all patients signed informed consent (UE nr. 128-14).",Excluded
1509,"Development of a method for measuring femoral torsion using real-time ultrasound. Excessive femoral torsion has been associated with various musculoskeletal and neurological problems. To explore this relationship, it is essential to be able to measure femoral torsion in the clinic accurately. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are thought to provide the most accurate measurements but CT involves significant radiation exposure and MRI is expensive. The aim of this study was to design a method for measuring femoral torsion in the clinic, and to determine the reliability of this method. Details of design process, including construction of a jig, the protocol developed and the reliability of the method are presented. The protocol developed used ultrasound to image a ridge on the greater trochanter, and a customized jig placed on the femoral condyles as reference points. An inclinometer attached to the customized jig allowed quantification of the degree of femoral torsion. Measurements taken with this protocol had excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability (ICC2,1 = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively). This method of measuring femoral torsion also permitted measurement of femoral torsion with a high degree of accuracy. This method is applicable to the research setting and, with minor adjustments, will be applicable to the clinical setting.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: In <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE treatments, bone marrow (BM) is one of the most important organs at risk. The authors previously developed an image-based two-compartment method for BM dosimetry, showing a significant correlation between absorbed dose to BM and hematological toxicity in <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE treatments. In the present study, they aimed to further evaluate this BM dosimetry method by finding optimal settings for dividing the whole body into two compartments; in terms of minimizing the coefficient of variation (CV) for the individual absorbed doses and studying its correlation to the BM response. The authors have also added specific absorbed fractions for male and female. Finally, they compare this two-compartment method with whole-body dosimetry.METHODS: This study included 46 patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE on two to five occasions at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Planar gamma camera images were collected at four time points postinjection, and a segmentation tool using a normalized number of uptake foci (nNUF) to divide the whole body into high- and low-uptake compartments was used. The authors characterized the two-compartment model and compared it with whole-body dosimetry.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The dosimetry method was robust, with an optimal nNUF value of 0.1-0.2. Using an nNUF value of 0.15, the absorbed BM dose was estimated as 0.20 Gy/7.4 GBq, and the CV as 8.4%.

The two-compartment method has potential as a valuable image-based alternative to blood-based BM dosimetry.",Excluded
1511,"Prospective evaluation of relationships between radiotherapy dose to masticatory apparatus and trismus. AIMS: This feasibility study aimed to identify relationships between radiation doses to the masticatory apparatus as a combined block or as individual subunits with changes in trismus following radiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients from a single center were recruited prospectively as part of a randomized trial comparing proactive exercises in the management of trismus. Patients with stage III/IV oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers received intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concurrent systemic therapy. All patients had trismus prior to radiotherapy. Maximal inter-incisor distance (MID) was measured pre- and 6 months from the start of radiotherapy. Bilateral muscles of mastication: medial and lateral pterygoids (MP and LP), masseters (M), temporalis (T), temporomandibular joint (TMJ) were contoured on CT images. The block comprised all muscles excluding the TMJ below the orbital floor. Mean dose, equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and V35-V60 Gy were compared with change in MID.RESULTS: In six patients, the MID deteriorated at 6 months from the start of radiotherapy compared with 14 whose MID improved. No significant association was observed between age, gender, smoking, alcohol status, exercise compliance, cisplatin, tumor site, stage, V35-V60 Gy or EUD with change in MID. A clinical outlier was excluded. Without the outlier (n = 19), a significant association was seen between mean dose and change in MID at 6 months for the ipsilateral block (p = .01), LP (p = .04) and M (p < .01). All patients where trismus deteriorated at 6 months received mean doses >40 Gy to the block.CONCLUSION: Higher mean radiation doses to the ipsilateral block, LP and M were significantly associated with deterioration in trismus. Limiting dose to these structures to <=40 Gy for tumors not invading the masticatory muscles may improve treatment-related sequelae. The ipsilateral block, LP and M should be studied further as possible alternative avoidance structures in radiotherapy treatment planning.",Excluded

PURPOSE: A prospective study was performed to formally relate dose-dependent radiologically defined changes in normal brain induced by radiotherapy (RT) to neurocognitive dysfunction in subjects with primary brain tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult patients receiving three-dimensional RT for central nervous system (CNS) tumors were enrolled. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and neuropsychological testing were performed before RT and 3 weeks and 6 months after treatment. Analyses were performed for correlations between changes in 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG)-PET (metabolism), (15)O-PET (relative blood flow), regional radiation dose, follow-up time, and neuropsychological test scores.RESULTS: Eleven subjects were enrolled and 6 completed follow-up studies. The PET data showed reduced FDG uptake, with average decreases of 2-6% in regions of the brain receiving greater than 40 Gy at 3 weeks' and 6 months' follow-up. The (15)O-H(2)O PET showed increases (<10%) at 3 weeks in relative regional blood flow in brain receiving greater than 30 Gy, but less at the 6-month follow-up studies. There were significant correlations between decreases in FDG uptake and increased scores from the Symptom Checklist-90-R, with an average increase in T score of 2 (p < 0.0001). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test showed a significant correlation of decreased FDG uptake with increased errors and perseveration in test performance, with an average decrease in T score of 11 (p = 0.037).CONCLUSIONS: A dose-dependent response of CNS tissue was detected using FDG PET in this small number of patients. Decreases in CNS metabolism correlated with decreased performance on neuropsychological tests for problem solving, cognitive flexibility, and global measures of psychopathology.

Between 1962 and 1986, 32 patients with intracranial meningiomas were referred to the Institut Gustave-Roussy for external radiotherapy either after incomplete surgery, or unfavorable histology (meningiosarcoma/anaplastic meningioma), or after recurrences. In the latter case, the mean time interval between the first surgery and the recurrence was 2 years (range: 1-6 years). Radiotherapy was performed using photons, electrons or mixed phetons-electrons. The mean total dose was 48 Gy (range: 9-65 Gy) delivered in a mean time of 35 days with a 19 mean number of fractions. Radiotherapy was interrupted in three cases at 9 Gy-17 Gy-20 Gy because of neurological worsening. The actuarial 5-year survival was 64%. Among the 32 patients, 11 died, eight of tumoral progression or recurrence and three of other causes (one ovarian carcinoma, two unknown). Among the 21 alive patients, eight presented a recurrence; five of them could be reoperated on with two complete resections. None of the following factors were found to be of prognostic value on the survival nor on the recurrence occurrence: age, tumor location, first surgical resection type, and, in the group of patients treated at the time of recurrence, the quality of the surgery at the time of recurrence and the time interval between the first surgery and the recurrence. Only one factor was evidenced as of significant value on the recurrence as well as the 10-year survival: the total dose of irradiation with a 10-year survival rate of 74% for total doses higher than or equal to 47 Gy versus 14% when the total dose was lower than 47 Gy.",Excluded
1515,"Wirelessly powered endoscopically implantable devices into the submucosa as the possible treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a rather common disease with a prevalence reaching up to 10 or 20% in the western world. The most specific symptoms which point to the diagnosis of GERD are feelings of heartburn and the regurgitation of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus. However, a certain number of patients do not respond to standard therapy, and in these cases, it is necessary to resort to other treatment methods, such as laparoscopic fundoplication or electrostimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter. The aim of our work was to design and manufacture a miniature, battery-less stimulator to provide electric stimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter, which could be implanted deep into the submucosa of the distal esophagus. The main goal was to provide a battery-less system as opposed to traditional battery neurostimulators to reduce the size and weight of the device. An electronic prototype of a wirelessly powered implantable device was developed. We used animal models for the experiments. The device is designed to treat GERD via electrical stimulation of the muscularis propria. It is implanted into the submucosal pocket by the lower esophageal sphincter with an endoscope. This method of implantation is superior to esophageal stimulators used today because of very low invasiveness of the surgery. Bipolar neurostimulation via two gold-plated leads is provided. The device does not have any source of energy; it is powered wirelessly which reduces the risk of potential battery leakage and reduces the overall dimensions. Copyright © 2019 J. Hajer et al.

In this study, the effects of (56)Fe irradiation on hippocampal function were assessed starting 2 weeks after whole-body irradiation. Compared to sham irradiation, radiation impaired novel object recognition in female and male C57BL/6J wild-type mice. There were no effects of irradiation on contextual fear conditioning or spatial memory retention in the water maze. It is possible that oxidative damage might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive changes. Therefore, hippocampal and cortical levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and lipid peroxidation, measures of oxidative damage were assessed. There were no effects of irradiation on these measures of oxidative damage. As (56)Fe irradiation can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which may contribute to the impairments in novel object recognition, the effects of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on cognition following sham irradiation and irradiation were also assessed. ALA did not prevent radiation-induced impairments in novel object recognition and impaired spatial memory retention of sham-irradiated and irradiated mice in the probe trial after the first day of hidden platform training in the water maze. Thus, the novel object recognition test is particularly sensitive to detect early cognitive effects of (56)Fe irradiation through a mechanism unlikely involving ROS or oxidative damage.",Included

We have developed an X-ray imaging protocol that permits 3D visualisation of a small number of implanted cells within bulk tissue. The cells are marked using natural endocytosis of inert gold nano-particles. The resulting local increase in electron density allows high imaging contrast to be obtained from small clusters of these marked cells. Using this technique we have imaged C6 glioma cells within the brain of a model animal. The cells were marked by exposing them to colloidal gold incorporated in the growth media. Gold-loaded glioma cells were implanted into the brains of adult male Wistar rats. After tumours had been allowed to develop for up to 2 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and images of the intact cranium were acquired at the SYRMEP imaging station on the Elettra synchrotron in Italy. Computed tomography was performed using mixed absorption and phase contrast techniques at an X-ray energy of 24 keV. In the resulting volume datasets the tumour bulk is clearly visible and the infiltrating nature of the malignant growth is well demonstrated.

1520,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent malignant gliomas. Purpose: To evaluate the role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of recurrent malignant gliomas. Patients and Methods: We treated 35 patients with large (median treatment volume, 28 cm<sup>3</sup>) recurrent tumors that had failed to respond to conventional treatment. Twenty-six patients (74%) had glioblastomas multiforme (GBM) and nine (26%) had anaplastic astrocytomas (AA). Result(s): The mean time from diagnosis to radiosurgery was 10 months (range, 1 to 36), from radiosurgery to death, 8.0 months (range, 1 to 23). Twenty-one GBM (81%) and six AA (67%) patients have died. The actuarial survival time for all patients was 21 months from diagnosis and 8 months from radiosurgery. Twenty-two of 26 patients (85%) died of local or marginal failure, three (12%) of noncontiguous failure, and one (4%) of CSF dissemination. Age (P = .0405) was associated with improved survival on multivariate analysis, and age (P = .0110) and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (P = .0285) on univariate analysis. Histology, treatment volume, and treatment dose were not significant variables by univariate analysis. Seven patients required surgical resection for increasing mass effect a mean of 4.0 months after radiosurgery, for an actuarial reoperation rate of 31%. Surgery did not significantly influence survival. At surgery, four patients had recurrent tumor, two had radiation necrosis, and one had both tumor and necrosis. The actuarial necrosis rate was 14% and the pathologic findings could have been predicted by the integrated logistic formula for developing symptomatic brain injury. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery appears to proofing survival for recurrent malignant gliomas and has a lower reoperative rate for symptomatic necrosis than does brachytherapy. Patterns of failure are similar for both of these techniques.",Excluded

Electrophysiological responses to electrical stimulation of the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal (GP) nerve (which innervates taste buds on the caudal 1/3 of the tongue) were recorded from single cells in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation was delivered as single pulses (n=55), paired-pulses (n=15) and tetanic trains (n=11). NTS cells with GP-evoked responses were also tested for responsivity to taste stimuli (0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 M sucrose, 0.01 M HCl and 0.01 M quinine HCl). Fifty-five neurons were studied: 49 cells showed GP-evoked (mean latency+/-SEM=18.0+/-1.32 ms); seven of these were taste-responsive. Spontaneous rate of these cells was low (mean+/-SEM=1.4+/-0.3 spikes per second; median=0.21 spikes per second) and many cells showed no spontaneous activity. Paired-pulse stimulation of the GP nerve in 13 rats produced both paired-pulse suppression (n=11) and paired-pulse enhancement (n=4); tetanic stimulation (25 Hz, 1.0 s) produced sustained (>20 s) increases or decreases in firing rate in 7 of 11 cells tested. Histological data suggested that GP-evoked responses recorded in the most rostral NTS were likely the result of polysynaptic connections. Cells with GP-evoked responses formed a heterogeneous group in terms of their response properties and differed from cells with evoked responses to chorda tympani (CT; which innervates taste buds on the rostral 1/3 of the tongue) nerve stimulation.

Material(s) and Method(s): Fourteen published studies reporting on human brain electrical activity measurements during and/or after such radiofrequency emissions were identified and compared. Conclusion(s): Although, in general, outcomes have been inconsistent and comparison between individual studies is difficult, enhanced electroencephalogram alpha-band power has been noted in several of the studies, a phenomenon also observed in some animal studies. Performance decrements observed in some recent extremely low frequency studies are consistent with enhanced alpha-band power, highlighting the possible role of extremely low frequency fields associated with battery current in mobile phone handsets. However, more complex cognitive tasks appear to show improved performance in relation to mobile phone exposure. Significant cognitive effects have been reported using both modulated and unmodulated radiofrequency carriers. The possibility of putative effects being due to extremely low frequency demodulation is therefore unlikely.

1524,"Treatment outcome for 757 patients with glioblastoma in 3 population-based neuro-oncology centres. Patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) havehistorically had a median survival of 9-11 months after surgeryand radiation therapy (RT). The addition of temozolomide(TMZ) to standard of care was supported by the 2005 Stuppstudy, which reported a median survival of 14.6 months.However, variation exists between and within patientpopulations. We examined three geographically distinctCanadian patient populations and evaluated the role of variousprognostic factors. Method(s): Patients with GBM were identified at threeCanadian centres, in two Canadian provinces, from prospectivelycollected databases of population-based neuro-oncology centres(years 2001-2008). Biopsy or extensive surgical debulking of thetumor was undertaken followed by RT, or RT with concomitantTMZ followed by 6-12 cycles of TMZ. MGMT promotermethylation status was assessed when possible. Result(s): A total of 757 patients were analyzed from threecentres: Calgary (n=352), Edmonton (n=211), and Halifax(n=194). The mean age was 60 years, 64% were male, and theoverall median survival was nine months with no differenceamong sites (p=0.90). The median survivals for methylated(n=172) versus otherwise (n=585) was 12 versus 8 months, fordebulking (n=485) versus biopsy (n=272) was 11 versus 5months, and for RT+TMZ (n=423) versus otherwise (n=334) was13 versus 4 months; p<0.001. A wider gradient of mediansurvivals was achieved by assigning a value of 1 for each ofmethylated, debulking, and RT+TMZ and summing to a scorebetween 0 and 3. The median survivals for patients scoring 0(n=135), 1 (n=254), 2 (n=278), and 3 (n=90) were 3, 7, 12, and19 months, respectively. Conclusion(s): Interesting similarities and differences werenoted among the three centres, yet patient outcomes (mediansurvival) were very comparable. Patients undergoing surgicaldebulking of methylated tumors who had both radiation therapyand chemotherapy had the best outcome (median survival 19months).",Excluded
1525,"[Radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy of vestibular schwannoma]. Management of vestibular schwannoma (VS) should always be interdisciplinary and results better than the natural course. Particularly in small VS, either microsurgical resection or radiosurgery (RS) can be employed. RS is a special method (initially only possible stereotactically) for delivering high-precision radiation from many directions to the target point (the isocenter) in a single high dose. With the development of three different systems-Gamma Knife (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden), special linear accelerators, and CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)-the options were extended to 1-5 fractions for RS and multisession RS (msRS), and to up to 6 weeks of conventional fractionation as stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Whereas RS uses high ablative single doses, SRT is based on the well-known radiobiological effects of multiple fractions comprising lower single doses up to a required much higher total dose. Evaluation showed that RS and SRT achieve similarly high rates of tumor control of around 90% and low rates of side effects (1-7%). Therefore, SRT is unnecessary for small but clearly progressing VS, which has made RS a very comfortable, effective treatment option. In addition to SRT, larger VS can be treated comparably effectively with CyberKnife-based msRS. Since modern MRI frequently discovers small VS as ""incidental findings"", the initial biding strategy (wait and scan) is of particular importance. Only with increasing symptoms and detectable tumor growth is the treatment indication established, at which time the decision for surgery and RS/SRT should be taken interdisciplinary under consideration of the patient's wishes.",Excluded
1526,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide controls the suprachiasmatic circadian clock network via ERK1/2 and DUSP4 signalling. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) co-ordinates circadian behaviour and physiology in mammals. Its cell-autonomous circadian oscillations pivot around a well characterised transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL), whilst the SCN circuit as a whole is synchronised to solar time by its retinorecipient cells that express and release vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The cell-autonomous and circuit-level mechanisms whereby VIP synchronises the SCN are poorly understood. We show that SCN slices in organotypic culture demonstrate rapid and sustained circuit-level circadian responses to VIP that are mediated at a cell-autonomous level. This is accompanied by changes across a broad transcriptional network and by significant VIP-directed plasticity in the internal phasing of the cell-autonomous TTFL. Signalling via ERK1/2 and tuning by its negative regulator DUSP4 are critical elements of the VIP-directed circadian re-programming. In summary, we provide detailed mechanistic insight into VIP signal transduction in the SCN at the level of genes, cells and neural circuit.",Excluded
1527,"Interleukin-6 primarily produced by non-hematopoietic cells mediates the lipopolysaccharide-induced febrile response. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is critical for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced febrile response. However, the exact source(s) of IL-6 involved in regulating the LPS-elicited fever is still to be identified. One known source of IL-6 is hematopoietic cells, such as monocytes. To clarify the contribution of hematopoietically derived IL-6 to fever, we created chimeric mice expressing IL-6 selectively either in cells of hematopoietic or, conversely, in cells of non-hematopoietic origin. This was performed by extinguishing hematopoietic cells in wild-type (WT) or IL-6 knockout (IL-6 KO) mice by whole-body irradiation and transplanting them with new stem cells. Mice on a WT background but lacking IL-6 in hematopoietic cells displayed normal fever to LPS and were found to have similar levels of IL-6 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in plasma and of IL-6 mRNA in the brain as WT mice. In contrast, mice on an IL-6 KO background, but with intact IL-6 production in cells of hematopoietic origin, only showed a minor elevation of the body temperature after peripheral LPS injection. While they displayed significantly elevated levels of IL-6 both in plasma and CSF compared with control mice, the increase was modest compared with that seen in LPS injected mice on a WT background, the latter being approximately 20 times larger in magnitude. These results suggest that IL-6 of non-hematopoietic origin is the main source of IL-6 in LPS-induced fever, and that IL-6 produced by hematopoietic cells only plays a minor role.",Excluded

1529,"A retrospective analysis in patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma: Is EGFR mutation associated with higher incidence of brain metastasis?. Purpose/Objective(s): Lung adenocarcinomas are more commonly associated with metastatic disease to the brain as compared with other histologic types of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have been demonstrated to be both predictive and prognostic for patients with lung adenocarcinoma. However, its impact on brain metastases (BM) remains inconclusive. This study aimed to explore the potential association between EGFR mutation and the risk of BM in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Furthermore we also intended to identify other risk factors for BM, which may guide the selection of management strategies. Materials/Methods: Clinical data of 234 patients at our institution from March 2007 to November 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients in this cohort had known EGFR mutation status and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The relationships between EGFR mutation and BM at the initial presentation and at the last follow-up were analyzed. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the independent factors associated with BM. Result(s): A total of 76 out of 234 patients (32.5%) had developed BM during their disease course amongst 39 patients (16.7%) had BM at their initial diagnosis. Within the entire cohort, 108 patients (46.2%) had EGFR mutations. As compared with that of wild type EGFR patients, the frequency of EGFR mutation was statistically higher for patients with BM at the initial diagnosis (64.1% vs. 35.9%, P=0.014) and at the last follow-up (63.2% vs. 36.8%, P=0.000). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of extracranial metastases regardless of EGFR mutation status either at the time of diagnosis or at the last follow-up (40.9% vs. 59.1%, P=0.313; 43.3% vs. 56.7%, P=0.494). In Multivariate Logistic regression analysis, EGFR mutation was significantly associated with the risk for BM at the initial diagnosis (OR=0.393, 95% CI=0.165-0.943, P=0.034). Among those 195 patients without BM at initial diagnosis, 1- year and 2-year accumulative rates of subsequent BM were significantly different between the patients with EGFR-mutant and EGFR-wild disease (15.0% vs. 4.2%, 37.7% vs. 18.7%; P=0.001). In Multivariate Cox regression analysis, only EGFR mutation was the independent factor for the risk of BM (HR=3.446, p=0.000). Conclusion(s): In our study, we demonstrated that BM was more common among patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, which may represent one of the distinct clinical features for EGFR-mutant tumors. EGFR mutation was the only independent predictive and prognostic risk factor for BM. The potential utility of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma should be further explored.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Despite aggressive treatment with radiation therapy plus concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ), the prognosis for glioblastoma remain poor. We investigated the potential of targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) to improve the therapeutic outcome of combined radiotherapy and TMZ in glioblastoma. METHODS ANDMATERIALS: We evaluated the preclinical potential of a STAT3 inhibitor, Cpd188 combined with temozolomide and radiation by in vitro clonogenic assays using two established glioblastoma cell lines (U251, U87) and two patients-derived glioblastoma cell lines (GBL12, GBL28) and in vivo studies using nude mice bearing intracranial U251 xenografts. RESULT(S): Cpd188 potentiated the radiosensitizing effect ofTMZ in U251 glioblastoma cell line which has high levels of p-STAT3 expression and in vitro. Increased radiosensitizing effects ofTMZwere associated with the induction of apoptosis and the reversion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cpd188 delayed in vivo tumor growth both alone and in combination with fractionated radiation and TMZ with a trend toward improved survival rates. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections showed that Cpd188 decreased the expression of CD31 (a marker of endothelial proliferation), vascular endothelial growth factor, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, suggesting that Cpd188 also has anti-angiogenic effects. We also confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of Cpd188 of GBL28 cell line which was originated from a patient who had a glioblastoma and also was confirmed high level of STAT3 expression and unmethylated MGMT. CONCLUSION(S): These data indicate that Cpd188 has the potential to improve the therapeutic outcome of combined radiotherapy and TMZ in human glioblastoma, especially in patients whose tumor has a high level of STAT3 expression regardless of MGMT methylation status.",Excluded
1532,"Online acid barrage stacking anti-salt injection for capillary electrophoresis of 9-fluorenymethylchloroformate-derivatized amino acids in high ionic strength solutions by UV detection. An acid barrage stacking (ABS) method has been shown to be feasible for online anti-salt injection in CE of 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC)-labeled amino acids (AAs) detected by common UV absorption. The operation was performed on normal polar CE by sucking in an extra plug of acid following a sample zone, serving as a selective acid barrage to block the backward migration of weak anionic analytes due to a sudden mobility reduction via acid-base reaction which does not affect strong coions such as Cl<sup>-</sup> to penetrate the barrage freely. By CE-UV of FMOC-AAs in various NaCl solutions, the effectiveness of ABS was firmly validated, able to stand up to 500 mM NaCl and to stack analytes by 10<sup>3</sup>-fold calculated from the UV detection limits, that is 0.01 muM for ABS and 10 muM for non-stacking injection. The method was also validated by determining trace Glu and Asp in real samples of rat brain microdialysate, rat serum and human saliva. The intraday RSDs were 0.33-4.9% for migration time and 1.8-9.6% for peak area. The recoveries measured by spiking technique were 82-115% for Glu and 86-116% for Asp. Working equations were obtained by plotting peak height vs. concentration at 0.1-50 muM with correlation coefficients of >0.999. The contents of Glu and Asp were thus found at 0.26-0.83 muM and 0.24-0.64 muM respectively, in rat brain microdialyste; 37-40 muM and 8.4-10 muM, respectively, in rat serum; and 3.5-5.8 muM and 1.0-4.1 muM. respectively in human saliva.

PURPOSE: Combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) for gastric cancer with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to the upper left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) allows kidney sparing despite improved target coverage. Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x ""positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined.RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.",Included

PURPOSE: Adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCHT) improves survival of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. Conventional three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to a significant amount of the left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) provides excellent target coverage with improved kidney sparing. Few long-term results on IMRT for gastric cancer, however, have been published. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3.0 T including blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and, for the first time, (23)Na imaging was used to evaluate renal status after radiotherapy with 3D-CRT or IG-IMRT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four disease-free patients (2 after 3D-CRT and 2 after IMRT; FU for all patients > 5 years) were included in this feasibility study. Morphological sequences, axial DWI images, 2D-gradient echo (GRE)-BOLD images, and (23)Na images were acquired. Mean values/standard deviations for ((23)Na), the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and R2* values were calculated for the upper/middle/lower parts of both kidneys. Corticomedullary (23)Na-concentration gradients were determined.RESULTS: Surprisingly, IG-IMRT patients showed no morphological alterations and no statistically significant differences of ADC and R2* values in all renal parts. Values for mean corticomedullary (23)Na-concentration matched those for healthy volunteers. Results were similar in 3D-CRT patients, except for the cranial part of the left kidney. This was atrophic and presented significantly reduced functional parameters (p = 0.001-p = 0.033). Reduced ADC values indicated reduced cell density and reduced extracellular space. Cortical and medullary R2* values of the left cranial kidney in the 3D-CRT group were higher, indicating more deoxygenated hemoglobin due to reduced blood flow/oxygenation. ((23)Na) of the renal cranial parts in the 3D-CRT group was significantly reduced, while the expected corticomedullary (23)Na-concentration gradient was partially conserved.CONCLUSIONS: Functional MRI can assess postradiotherapeutic renal changes. As expected, marked morphological/functional effects were observed in high-dose areas (3D-CRT), while, unexpectedly, no alteration in kidney function was observed in IG-IMRT patients, supporting the hypothesis that reducing total/fractional dose to the renal parenchyma by IMRT is clinically beneficial.",Excluded
1536,"Perceptual centering of body segment orientation. It has been shown experimentally that under certain combinations of sensory stimuli, human subjects can perceive one of several distinct illusions about their overall orientation in or movement through space. In at least some cases, the structure of such multistable illusory perceptions of orientation can be efficiently described by perceptual transformations that act on a current orientation estimate to yield an updated perceptual construct. Repeated application of identified generating transformations yields a limited set of predicted illusions for a given sensory environment. This approach is especially valuable for perceptual data that exhibits discretely differing classes of illusions between subjects or trials. In a previous study, application of a semigroup of perceptual centering transformations has succeeded in reproducing and simplifying data from an experiment in which subjects experiencing visual vection reported a range of illusions about the orientations of their gaze, head, and torso to gravity. After reviewing previously obtained results on perceptual centering, this article generalizes the approach, presenting the mathematics required to characterize perceptual transformations. The developed framework should be widely applicable in the understanding of perceptual illusions, particularly when these are guided by alignment with preferred constructs. Secondly, the article reveals the nontrivial mathematical process of perceptual semigroup formation and evaluation, deducing the complete description of the semigroup constructed in the previous study. Perceptual centering transformations identified in terrestrial experiments may predict illusions to be expected in spaceflight. For example, our results indicate that under certain conditions, many astronauts will misperceive a visual rotation axis to be centered in front of the head or even the torso.",Excluded

The upper side was exposed to an atmosphere of humidified oxygen. With longlasting light stimuli (30-180 s) the [K+]0 around receptors first falls from its dark-adaptation value (4.6 +/- 0.4 mM) to 3.3 +/- 0.6 mM and then reaccumulates nearly to the pre-stimulus value. The time course of reaccumulation varies greatly (30-180 s) between preparations. The peak time (90% value) of the [K+]0 decrease is several seconds. It seems that the more rapidly the retina is prepared the shorter the peak time of the [K+]0 reaccumulation and the more rapid the [K+]0 reaccumulation. This suggests that the [K+]0 reaccumulation is effected by active, oxygen-dependent mechanisms. PIII always precedes the [K+]0 change, its peak time is several 100 ms. During longlasting light stimuli (30-180 s) slow PIII reflects the difference in the [K+]0 changes around the photoreceptors and at the vitreal surface.

Thoracic radiotherapy has been shown in to increase overall survival when added to systemic therapy in patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and M0 stage. The dose, fractionation, treatment time and timing issues have not been fully resolved. A recent study did not show the superiority of 66Gy in 33 daily fractions over 6.5 weeks over twice-daily radiotherapy to a dose of 45 Gy in 30 fractions over 3 weeks twice daily [1]. For stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has been clearly shown to be superior to conventional fractionation [2]. Given the clear benefit seen in early stage NSCLC, it is postulated that SABR may have a role to play in early stage SCLC. A recent multi-institutional cohort study has reported favourable outcomes in this setting [3]. However, randomised data of equivalence or indeed superiority are lacking. Furthermore, questions remain as the timing and role of systemic therapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation when SABR is used in this setting. In advanced SCLC, many tumors display neuroendocrine clinical and cytological features and many SCLC tumors express somatostatin receptor and this can be imaged using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs such as <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE [4]. Given the uptake by some SCLC tumors of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE, higher doses of the tracer have been used in an attempt to provide radiolabelled radiotherapy treatment in metastatic disease in what has been described as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) [5]. This molecularly target radiotherapy is a potentially exciting therapeutic approach, but the ideal positioning of such therapy in tumors which are suitable for treatment with PRRT and the safety of PRRT with systemic therapy have yet to be determined.

Cultured fibroblast cells from 19 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 3 patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), 3 AT heterozygotes and 11 (presumed) normal subjects were studied for impaired colony-forming ability after chronic gamma irradiation. Five cell lines from the NHL patients were also examined for the sensitivity to acute gamma irradiation, as compared with those of normal subjects. To ascertain the degree of radiosensitivity of different cell lines, a comparison was made of the D10 values (radiation dose resulting in 10% survival) for each cell line, estimated ""by eye"" from the actual survival curves, and also from the calculated curves fitted to a log-linear model. It was observed that the acute gamma irradiation failed to show any appreciable difference in the radiation response of the cell lines from NHL patients as compared with those of normal subjects. However, chronic irradiation demonstrated significantly increased radiosensitivity in at least 10-12 NHL patients with a p value of less than 0.05, when the D10 values of each patient's cell line were compared with the calculated composite values for the normals. When the D10 values of the NHL patients and the normal subjects were compared as 2 groups, the former appeared to be significantly more sensitive to chronic gamma irradiation (p less than 0.0001). The same level of significant difference in radiosensitivity was found between the 2 groups when their D37 values (radiation dose resulting in 37% survival) were compared. In general, the radiation response of the NHL patients was similar to that of the AT homozygotes and heterozygotes used as a positive control group. Our data thus show that increased radiosensitivity is associated with the NHL patients studied, indicating an underlying abnormality of their DNA repair.",Excluded

After adaptation of mono- or bi-exponential fit functions to the measured data, it was analyzed for each fit function how precise the time integral can be estimated from fixed tissue-specific half-lives and a single measurement at 24, 48, or 72 h after the administration.RESULTS: For the kidneys, assuming a fixed tissue-specific half-life of 50 h, the deviations of the estimate from the actual integral were median (5 % percentile, 95 % percentile): -3 degree% (-15 %>; +16 degree%) for measurements after 24 h, +2 %> (-9 %>; +12 %>) for measurements after 48 h, and 0 % (-2 %; +12 %) for measurements after 72 h. The corresponding values for the other tissues, assuming fixed tissue-specific half-lives of 67 h for liver and spleen and 77 h for tumors, were +2 % (-25 %; +20 %) for measurements after 24 h, +2 degree% (-16 %>; +17 %>) for measurements after 48 h, and +2 %> (-11 %>; +10 %>) for measurements after 72 h.CONCLUSIONS: Especially for the kidneys, which often represent the dose limiting organ, but also for liver, spleen, and neuroendocrine tumors, a meaningful absorbed dose estimate is possible from a single measurement after 2, more preferably 3 days after the administration of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-TATE/-TOC assuming fixed tissue specific effective half-lives.",Excluded
1544,"Cognitive function and patient-reported memory problems after radiotherapy for cancers at the skull base: A cross-sectional survivorship study using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module. Background: Using patient-reported and objective assessment tools, we sought to quantify cognitive symptoms and objective cognitive dysfunction in patients irradiated for skull base cancer. Method(s): Participants were assessed using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck module (MDASI-HN), with subsequent analysis. Result(s): Of the 122 participants analyzed, the majority (63%) had no frank detectable cognitive impairment by TICS, with frank impairment in 6%. Overall, mean patient-reported problems with memory (MDASI<inf>memory</inf>) was 3.3 (SD +/-2.66). On recursive partition analysis, the MDASI<inf>memory</inf> cutoff point of >=5 was associated with detectable cognitive impairment by TICS (logworth 1.69; P =.02), yet no MDASI<inf>memory</inf> threshold was associated with unambiguous absence of impairment by TICS. Conclusion(s): Approximately one third of patients had ambiguous results by TICS assessment, for whom more rigorous testing may be warranted. Moderate to severe levels of patient-reported memory complaints on the MDASI-HN module may have utility as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction in this population.

Between 1985 and 1999, 43 patients with locally-advanced, resectable oropharyngeal cancer were treated with combined surgery and post-operative radiation therapy (RT) at Oregon Health and Science University. Five patients (12 per cent) had Stage III disease and 38 patients (88 per cent) had Stage IV disease. All patients had gross total resections of the primary tumour. Thirty-seven patients had neck dissections for regional disease. RT consisted of a mean tumour-bed dose of 63.0 Gy delivered in 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions over a mean of 49 days. At three- and five-years, the actuarial local control was 96 per cent and the actuarial local/regional control was 80 per cent. The three- and five-year actuarial rates of distant metastases were 41 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively. The actuarial overall survival at three- and five-years was 41 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively. The actuarial rates of progression-free survival were 49 per cent at three-years and 45 per cent at five years.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is an emerging technique for treating tumors in animals.OBJECTIVES: To assess the outcome of dogs with suspected intracranial trigeminal nerve peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) treated with SRT.ANIMALS: Eight dogs with presumptive PNST.METHODS: This was a retrospective study of dogs identified by searching UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital medical records for dogs treated with SRT for a presumed PNST. Presumptive diagnosis was based on magnetic resonance imaging. SRT was delivered in 3 dose fractions of 8 Gray (Gy) on consecutive days or every other day to a total dose of 24 Gy.RESULTS: Median disease-specific survival was 745 days (range: 99-1375 days, n = 6). No signs of acute adverse effects of radiation treatment were recorded. Late radiation effects versus tumor progression could not be confirmed histopathologically because of few animals undergoing necropsy.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study provides preliminary evidence that dogs with PNST benefit from SRT in terms of long-term survival. The treatment appears to be well tolerated and requires fewer anesthetic events for animals compared to full-course radiation.",Excluded
1547,"Whole-body screening of atherosclerosis with magnetic resonance angiography. With whole-body magnetic resonance angiography (WBMRA), it is possible to examine the whole arterial tree except intracranial and coronary vessels in a single examination without the risks involved in ionizing radiation or arterial cannulation. Whole-body magnetic resonance angiography is well suited for repeated clinical examinations in patients with systemic diseases such as vasculitis or atherosclerosis and can also be used for scientific purposes. On the basis of the WBMRA overview, a possible further development of the WBMRA concept can be to perform further acquisitions at sites with atherosclerotic plaques with higher-resolution scans to determine the degree of stenosis more accurately or to achieve plaque characterization. A total validation of WBMRA compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is not possible owing to the hazards of ionizing radiation. Studies have shown a high sensitivity and specificity for the pelvic and lower limb arteries in comparison with DSA. No systematic validation against DSA has been performed for the renal, aortic, and carotid arteries. Various methods have been used, however, for confirmation of vascular abnormalities found on WBMRA such as ultrasonography, dedicated MRA, or DSA, with reasonably high agreement. The WBMRA method has not been studied with regard to prediction of future cardiovascular (CV) events, as have intima media thickness, coronary artery calcium scoring, and the ankle-brachial index. The full usefulness of WBMRA in an epidemiological setting and as a complementary screening tool for assessing CV risk still needs to be validated against future CV events.

1549,"Subcutaneous or topical administration of 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> protects from radiation-induced alopecia in mice. Alopecia, a common sequel of radiation treatment of brain tumors, increases patient stress to the extent that refusal of treatment may occur. The expectation that loss of hair will be prevented, or that regrowth will occur, is extremely important to patients. To investigate prostaglandin- induced radiation protection against alopecia, the hair of B6D2F<inf>1</inf> male mice was plucked from the right thigh and surrounding area to induce anagen. Fourteen days later, mice were injected subcutaneously in the neck with 10 mug 16,16 dm PGE<inf>2</inf> in 0.2 ml of vehicle, or with the vehicle alone. In another group of previously plucked mice, 16,16 dm PGE<inf>2</inf> in the same concentration, or the vehicle was applied topically. One hour later, graded single doses from 6.5 to 12.5 Gy <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma irradiation were given to groups of six animals. On day 21 post-plucking, all animals were killed and a portion of the irradiated site was excised. The average hair counts per field in irradiated animals were 85 +/- 4 (6.5 Gy), 25 +/- 5 (8.5 Gy), and 5.5 +/- 0.7 (10 Gy). Animals receiving the prostaglandin systemically had values of 60 +/- 10 (6.5 Gy), 54 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 66 +/- 6 (10 Gy), and 30.1 +/- 8 (12.5 Gy). Topical application of the prostaglandin resulted in protection that yielded 52 +/- 3 (8.5 Gy), 34 +/- 4 (10 Gy), and 3.2 +/- 0.9 (12.5 Gy) hairs per field. Both systemic and topical application of 16,16 dm PGE<inf>2</inf> protected from some degree of radiation-induced alopecia, which supports the conclusion that prostaglandins may be useful in the protection of hair follicles in patients treated with radiation for brain tumors.",Excluded
1550,"Principles of radiotherapy of neoplastic meningosis. Neoplastic meningosis can be a complication of a tumor originating in the brain or the meninges, or it can be a complication of a solid tumor elsewhere that has metastasized to the leptomeninges. The therapeutic dilemma for a radiation oncologist is that neoplastic meningosis involves the entire neuraxis and, as a consequence, ideally, the entire neuraxis should be radiated. However, delivering the necessary radiation dose to the entire neuraxis may be associated with considerable neurologic or bone marrow toxicity. Radiotherapy of neoplastic meningosis can be performed by external beam radiation or by intrathecal injection of radioactive nuclides or radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. Intrathecal radiation has the theoretical advantage that treatment is directed towards the entire neuraxis with limited irradiation outside the neuraxis. In practice, intrathecal radiation is still under investigation and subject to some limitations and toxicities. Indications and techniques for external beam radiation may range from either therapeutic or elective cranial or craniospinal radiation to palliative involved-field radiation. Patients with neoplastic meningosis are frequently treated with a combination of radiation and chemotherapy, and/or may have been irradiated to the nervous system in the past. Both are well known risk factors for radiation damage to the nervous system. In general, current treatment protocols focus on the development of combination chemotherapy programs and reduction of the radiation dose to minimize toxicity and/or to improve tumor control.",Excluded
1551,"Effects on the nervous system by exposure to electromagnetic fields: experimental and clinical studies. Exposure to electromagnetic fields may cause various types of effects on nervous tissue, in severe cases even irreversible damage. The exposure conditions, i.e. frequency including type and extent of modulation, time, intensity, wave form, as well as shape, size and position of exposed subject and possible treatment with drugs, are factors determining if damage, acute or chronic, ultimately result. Long term exposure of newborn rabbits, rats and mice to electromagnetic fields of power frequency (10-14 kV/m; 50 or 60 Hz; sinusoidal wave form; 21-24 h per day) may cause affection and even damage to the nervous system. Large nerve cells showed reactive changes such as lamellar bodies and cytoskeletal alteration to an extent varying with exposure conditions. Reactive neuroglial changes as well as increase in neuroglial marker proteins could concomitantly be demonstrated. The changes seemed to be reversible although we only have incomplete data available. Exposure in vitro of frog sciatic nerve to 16-60 Hz sinusoidal low current (50-1000 nA) for 17 h induced cytoskeletal changes. Exposure of rabbits to pulsed microwaves of moderate to high intensity (3.1 GHz; 300 Hz modulation; peak duration 1.4 usec with maximal peak intensity about 1000 times average; 55 mW/cm; SAR in the brain cortex about 20 W/kg; increase of temperature as measured by lightguide-equipped instruments in right brain hemisphere about 1-2 degrees C) during 1 h per day during three days resulted in no obvious initial changes in behaviour. Minimal acute dam- age could be demonstrated. However, after two to four months and later on both structural, immunohistochemical and biochemical changes could be documented. Radar technicians accidently and/or occupationally exposed to microwaves showed psychoneurological signs of affection as well as changes in cerebrospinal fluid protein pattern. No related changes have been noticed among matched controls. Exposure of nervous tissue to electromagnetic fields ranging from power frequency to microwaves may thus exert a wide range of effects, mostly by mechanisms we know little about.",Excluded
1552,"The excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist MK-801 prevents the hypersensitivity induced by spinal cord ischemia in the rat. Protection by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 against transient spinal cord ischemia-induced hypersensitivity was studied in rats. The spinal ischemia was initiated by vascular occlusion resulting from the interaction between the photosensitizing dye Erythrosin B and an argon laser beam. The hypersensitivity, termed allodynia, where the animals reacted by vocalization to nonnoxious mechanical stimuli in the flank area, was consistently observed during several days after induction of the ischemia. Pretreatment with MK-801 (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, iv) 10 min before laser irradiation dose dependently prevented the occurrence of allodynia. The neuroprotective effect of MK-801 was not reduced by maintaining normal body temperature during and after irradiation. There was a significant negative correlation between the delay in the administration of MK-801 after irradiation and the protective effect of the drug. Histological examination revealed slight morphological damage in the spinal cord in 38% of control rats after 1 min of laser irradiation without pretreatment with MK-801. No morphological abnormalities were observed in rats after pretreatment with MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg). The present results provide further evidence for the involvement of excitatory amino acids, through activation of the NMDA receptor, in the development of dysfunction following ischemic trauma to the spinal cord.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Excessive activity of NMDA-type (N-methyl-d-aspartate) glutamatergic channels has been implicated as a mechanism for neuronal injury in neurologic disorders, including glaucoma, and retinal disease. This study was designed to characterize the retinal response to experimental manipulations that mimic features of glutamatergic excitotoxic insult and also to determine whether memantine, an NMDA-type glutamatergic channel blocker, is effective in reversing experimental excitotoxicity.METHODS: Recordings of the electroretinogram (ERG) and spiking activity of single retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were made from rabbit retinas. Excitotoxic insult was induced by either (1) application of NMDA, a selective NMDA receptor agonist; (2) application of TBOA (dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid), a selective inhibitor of glutamate transporters, or (3) perfusion with magnesium-free medium. For each condition, memantine was coapplied to determine its efficacy for reversal of experimental excitotoxicity. Memantine was also applied in isolation to characterize any effect on retinal responses to light stimuli.RESULTS: All three experimental manipulations were associated with an increase in the tonic level of RGC spiking activity, a reduction in RGC spike amplitude, and, in some cells, block of spike generation. Experimental excitotoxicity had little or no effect on ERG responses. Coapplication of memantine was associated with recovery of RGC tonic spiking activity and spike amplitude toward control levels. Application of memantine in isolation was associated with a dose-dependent effect on the timing of ERG and RGC-OFF responses.CONCLUSIONS: Memantine was effective in reversing acute experimental excitotoxicity at concentrations that have little effect on retinal light signaling.",Excluded
1560,"A phantom study to determine the optimum size of a single collimator for shortening the treatment time in CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery of spherical targets. Prolonged treatment execution time is a concern in CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery. Beam reduction and node reduction technique, and monitor unit optimization methods are adopted to reduce the treatment time. Usage of single collimator in the CyberKnife treatment plan can potentially reduce collimator exchange time. An optimal single collimator, which yields an acceptable dose distribution along with minimum number of nodes, beams, and monitor units, can be a versatile alternative for shortening treatment time. The aim of the present study is to find the optimal single collimator in CyberKnife treatment planning to shorten the treatment time with the acceptable dose distribution. A spherical planning target volume PTV1 was drawn in an anthropomorphic head and neck phantom. Plans with same treatment goals were generated for all the 12 collimators independently. D(95%) was selected as the prescribing isodose and the prescribed dose was 10 Gy. The plan of the optimal collimator size was evaluated for conformity, homogeneity, and dose spillage outside the target. The optimum collimator size and the target dimensions were correlated. The study was repeated with two other target volumes PTV2 and PTV3 for generalizing the results. Collimator sizes just above the diameter of the spherical PTVs were yielding least number of nodes and beams with acceptable dose distributions. The collimator size of 35 mm is optimum for the PTV1, whose diameter is 31.4 mm. Similarly, 50 mm collimator is optimum for PTV2 (diameter= 45.2 mm) and 20 mm collimator is optimum for PTV3 (Diameter = 17.3 mm). The total number of monitor units is found to reduce with increasing collimator size. Optimal single collimator is found to be useful for shortening the treatment time in spherical targets.

The structural organization of the retinula cells in the eye of Ligia exotica changes diurnally. At night, the microvilli elongate, losing the regular and parallel alignment characteristic of the day condition. Crystalline cones and distal rhabdom tips are not pushed into each other during the day, but at night the rhabdoms protrude into the crystalline cones by up to 5 microm. Screening pigment granules in the retinula cells disperse during the night, but migrate radially towards the vicinity of the rhabdom during the day. No such displacements of the pigment granules of either distal or proximal screening pigment cells were observed. The sensitivity of the eye, monitored by electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, changes diurnally: values at midnight are, on average, 10 times those occurring during the day. However, intracellular recordings from single retinula cells (50 during the day and 50 at night) indicate that the difference between night and day sensitivities is only 2.5-fold. Two-dimensional angular sensitivity curves, indicative of a single unit's spatial sensitivity, had considerably less regular outlines at night than during the day. If based on the 50 % sensitivity level, day and night eyes possessed receptive fields of almost identical width (approximately 2 degrees), but if sensitivities below the 50 % limit were included, then receptive fields at night were significantly more extensive. We suggest that the morphological adaptations and diurnal changes in chromophore content seen in the apposition eye of L. exotica allow this animal to improve its photon capture at night while preserving at least some of the spatial resolving power characteristic of the light-adapted state. This would explain why this animal is capable of performing complex escape behaviours in the presence of predators both in bright and in very dim light.",Excluded
1562,"Epworth Sleepiness Scale-a novel tool to assess somnolence syndrome post radiotherapy to brain. Introduction: Radiation to brain causes early, early-delayed and delayed side effects.1 Although early and delayed effects are well studied, there is paucity of literature regarding early-delayed effects like somnolence syndrome. The existing studies use general symptom assessment and visual analog scales.2 Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a time tested tool to assess daytime sleepiness in various conditions.3 This study is an attempt to determine the presence of somnolence in our patients using this novel scale. It is a simple questionnaire and we expect this will be able to grade the severity of somnolence. This is the first study to our knowledge to determine post radiation somnolence using Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Objective(s): To study the incidence of somnolence syndrome in patients receiving radiotherapy to brain. Material(s) and Method(s): 23 patients with primary brain tumor or metastases to brain were the subjects of the study. Patient demographics and tumor type- primary or metastatic along with grade was noted. Patients with Karnofsky performance status less than 70 and those with pre-existing sleep disorders were excluded from the study. Patients were treated with palliative whole brain radiation for brain metastases and conformal adjuvant radiotherapy for primary brain tumors as per standard guidelines. Patients were subjected to Epworth Sleepiness Scale3 at baseline, thereafter every week during radiation; also continuing weekly after cessation of radiation until 6 weeks post treatment. Result(s): All 23 patients (median age 50 years) completed the planned questionnaires until 6 weeks post radiation. 20 had primary brain tumors whereas 3 had metastatic lesions in brain. Of the 23 patients, 14 patients (60.86%) had abnormal or increased daytime sleepiness; of which 3 had ESS scores greater than 16. Conclusion(s): Somnolence occurred in 60.86% of the patients who underwent radiation treatment for brain tumors, which is in accordance with existing literature.4,5 Epworth Sleepiness Scale is an effective tool to detect and quantify somnolence, however it does not consider other symptoms of somnolence syndrome and hence should be combined with visual analog scale to get complete information.",Excluded

Some of the most recently constructed epithermal neutron beams approach the theoretical optimum for beam purity. Of these higher quality beams, at least one is suitable for use in high through-put routine therapy. It is concluded that reactor-based epithermal neutron beams with near optimum characteristics are currently available and more can be constructed at existing reactors. Suitable reactors include relatively low power reactors using the core directly as a source of neutrons or a fission converter if core neutrons are difficult to access. Thermal neutron beams for NCT studies with small animals or for shallow tumor treatments, with near optimum properties have been available at reactors for many years. Additional high quality thermal beams can also be constructed at existing reactors or at new, small reactors.

1569,"Improving outcome in severe trauma: what's new in ABC? Imaging, bleeding and brain injury. Appropriate imaging is critical in the initial assessment of patients with severe trauma. Plain radiographs remain integral to the primary survey. Focused ultrasonography is useful for identifying intraperitoneal fluid likely to represent haemorrhage in patients who are shocked and also has a role in identifying intrathoracic pathology. Modern scanners permit a greater role for CT, being more rapid and exposing the patient to less ionising radiation. 'Whole body' (head to pelvis) CT scanning has been shown to identify injuries missed by 'traditional' focused assessment and may be associated with an improved outcome. CT identifies more spinal injuries than plain radiographs, is the gold standard for diagnosing blunt aortic injury and facilitates non-operative management of solid organ injury and other bleeding. Coagulopathy occurs early in trauma as a direct result of injury and hypoperfusion. Damage control resuscitation with blood components is associated with an improved outcome in patients with trauma with massive haemorrhage. Packed cells and fresh frozen plasma should be used in a 1:1 to 1:2 ratio. Bedside measures of coagulopathy may prove useful. Adjuvant early treatment with tranexamic acid is of benefit in reducing blood loss and reducing mortality. Limited 'damage control surgery' with early optimisation of physiology augmented by interventional radiology to control haemorrhage is preferable to early definitive care. Limiting haemorrhage by correction of anticoagulation and minimising secondary brain injury through optimal supportive care is critical to improving outcome in neurotrauma.",Excluded

This article summarizes tumor control and functional outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with nonvestibular schwannomas, in comparison with those treated with microsurgical resection. To date, surgical resection has been a common treatment for nonvestibular schwannomas. Because these tumors are generally benign, complete tumor resection is a desirable curative treatment. However, it is almost infeasible to completely remove these tumors without any complications, even for experienced neurosurgeons, because of adherence to surrounding critical structures such as cranial nerves, brainstem, or vessels.

1575,"Repeat radiosurgery for refractory trigeminal neuralgia. OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery has become an important and minimally invasive alternative for patients with refractory trigeminal neuralgia. When a second procedure is necessary, the outcomes are unknown. The degree of pain relief and morbidity after repeat radiosurgery were studied.METHODS: Thirty-one patients underwent a second gamma knife radiosurgery procedure because of unsatisfactory or unsustained relief of pain after the first procedure. Twenty-seven patients were assessable at median follow-up periods of 42.7 and 20.4 months after the first and second procedures, respectively. Most patients had undergone multiple previous operations of other types (microvascular decompression, radiofrequency rhizotomy, glycerol rhizotomy, balloon compression). The median target doses of the first and second radiosurgeries were 75 and 64 Gy, respectively. All patients were evaluated by a physician who did not participate in patient treatment.RESULTS: After the first radiosurgical procedure, 13 patients had an excellent response initially (complete relief without any medication), 3 had a good response (complete relief with some medication), 7 had a fair response (>50% relief), and 4 had a poor response (<50% pain relief or treatment failure). Repeat radiosurgery was performed in patients with recurrent or residual pain. After the second radiosurgical procedure, 5 patients had an excellent response, 8 had a good response, 10 had a fair response, and 4 had a poor response. Thirteen patients (48%) achieved complete pain relief (with or without medication). Two patients (7.4%) experienced new sensory symptoms after the first radiosurgical procedure, and three (12.7%, actuarial) experienced new sensory symptoms after the second procedure.CONCLUSION: Repeat radiosurgery provided a similar rate of pain relief as the first procedure, despite a modest dose reduction. The risk of new sensory symptoms was increased, but no other morbidity was identified. For patients who experience recurrent pain and choose to undergo a second procedure, our current procedure is to deliver a maximum dose of 50 to 60 Gy to a trigeminal target anterior to the root entry zone near the entrance of the nerve beneath the petrous dura.",Excluded

We employed a triple-headed SPECT gammacamera system equipped with fan beam collimators for acquisition with line transmission sources placed at the focal lines of the fan-beam collimators. Two mode, sequential mode and simultaneous mode, of data acquisition protocols were examined. In the sequential mode, a transmission scan was carried out using three external sources for the brain phantom without emission tracer. After removing all sources, an emission scan was performed on the brain phantom containing the tracer. In the simultaneous mode, the injection was followed by a simultaneous transmission emission scan using one transmission source. The same study was conducted out for the normal volunteer, after confirming the effectiveness of these protocols with phantom studies. Corrected SPECT count values obtained with two protocols were almost identical.

This study aimed atdetermining the agreement between two different software packages for delineating corticospinal tract (CST), arcuate fasciculus (AF) and optic radiation (OR). METHOD(S): Forty-six histopathologically proven gliomapatients subdivided into:groupA with tracts passing at the tumour margin; and groupB with tracts passing through tumour and/ or in the peritumoural oedema. FSL and MRTrix software were used for tracking, in each patient,CST (hand, foot and lips component), AF and OR using the same regions of interest. Qualitative evaluation of the agreement between the two methods was performed by two experienced observers in consensus. RESULT(S): The tracts identified: Were comparable for: CST-foot in 8(5) out of 11(8) cases in groupA (B); CST-hand in 6 out of 8 cases in groupB; Had less false positives in MRTrix for: CST-hand in 7 out of 11 cases in groupA; CST-lips in 5(6) out of 8(8) cases in groupA (B); AF in 4(8) out of 7(9) cases in groupA (B); Were more accurate in FSL for: OR in 6(6) out of 6(7) cases in groupA (B).

Wireless internet (Wi-Fi) electromagnetic waves (2.45 GHz) have widespread usage almost everywhere, especially in our homes. Considering the recent reports about some hazardous effects of Wi-Fi signals on the nervous system, this study aimed to investigate the effect of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi radiation on multisensory integration in rats. This experimental study was done on 80 male Wistar rats that were allocated into exposure and sham groups. Wi-Fi exposure to 2.4 GHz microwaves [in Service Set Identifier mode (23.6 dBm and 3% for power and duty cycle, respectively)] was done for 30 days (12 h/day). Cross-modal visual-tactile object recognition (CMOR) task was performed by four variations of spontaneous object recognition (SOR) test including standard SOR, tactile SOR, visual SOR, and CMOR tests. A discrimination ratio was calculated to assess the preference of animal to the novel object. The expression levels of M1 and GAT1 mRNA in the hippocampus were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Results demonstrated that rats in Wi-Fi exposure groups could not discriminate significantly between the novel and familiar objects in any of the standard SOR, tactile SOR, visual SOR, and CMOR tests. The expression of M1 receptors increased following Wi-Fi exposure.

1580,"Inhibition of PI3K signalling increases the efficiency of radiotherapy in glioblastoma cells. Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumour, is also considered one of the most lethal cancers per se. It is highly refractory to therapeutic intervention, as highlighted by the mean patient survival of only 15 months, despite an aggressive treatment approach, consisting of maximal safe surgical resection, followed by radio- and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy, in particular, can have effects on the surviving fractions of tumour cells, which are considered adverse to the desired clinical outcome: It can induce increased cellular proliferation, as well as enhanced invasion. In this study, we established that differentiated glioblastoma cells alter their DNA repair response following repeated exposure to radiation and, therefore, high single-dose irradiation (SD-IR) is not a good surrogate marker for fractionated dose irradiation (FD-IR), as used in clinical practice. Integrating irradiation into a combination therapy approach, we then investigated whether the pharmacological inhibition of PI3K signalling, the most abundantly activated survival cascade in glioblastoma, enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy. Of note, treatment with GDC-0941, which blocks PI3K-mediated signalling, did not enhance cell death upon irradiation, but both treatment modalities functioned synergistically to reduce the total cell number. Furthermore, GDC-0941 not only prevented the radiation-induced increase in the motility of the differentiated cells, but further reduced their speed below that of untreated cells. Therefore, combining radiotherapy with the pharmacological inhibition of PI3K signalling is a potentially promising approach for the treatment of glioblastoma, as it can reduce the unwanted effects on the surviving fraction of tumour cells.",Excluded

1582,"Classifying the risk of ionizing radiation exposure after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Learning Objectives: We hypothesized that patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) could be classified by their risk of receiving potentially harmful ionizing radiation exposure (PHIRE) from diagnostic tests and medical procedures. Method(s): The EMR of all patients admitted to our institution with aSAH from 01/2012-12/2015 were retrospectively evaluated using an IRB-approved protocol for patient-specific and disease-specific data. Patients were excluded if they died prior to discharge. Total effective dose of ionizing radiation (TEDIR) was calculated from published data. PHIRE was considered to have occurred in patients with TEDIR> 50 mSV, the annual radiation exposure limit for radiation workers. A multivariate classification tree was created to predict PHIRE risk groups. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk of PHIRE between the risk groups. Result(s): Data were collected from 108 aSAH patients. The mean TEDIR was 47.8 mSv. After development of the multivariate classification tree, the tree was pruned to include only ventriculostomy (EVD), Hunt/Hess score (HH), and aneurysm location, according to normal statistical conventions. Patients who did not have an ventriculostomy (EVD) were at low risk for PHIRE (N = 2/35, (5.7%)). Patients with an EVD + HH 2 + anterior circulation aneurysms were at moderate risk for PHIRE (N = 17/42, 40.5%). (OR = 11.2, p = 0.002). Patients with an EVD + HH < 2 or EVD + HH 2 + posterior circulation aneurysms were at high risk for PHIRE (N = 23/31, 74.2%) (OR = 47.4, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In this study, aSAH patients were categorized into low, moderate and high risk groups of PHIRE according to three factors: EVD, HH, and aneurysm location. These groups likely represent differential baseline neurologic status and risk of neurologic complications. Alternative diagnostic or therapeutic modalities should be utilized, when possible, for patients in the high-risk group and should be considered for patients in the moderate-risk group.

Postimplantation routine imaging had failed to locate the missing seed, but he subsequently presented with back pain and parathesia with radiation down the leg.RESULTS: CT with bony windows and MRI had located the seed in the left L5 vertebral venous plexus. Neurosurgical intervention failed to locate and remove the migrated seed. Postsurgery, the left lower limb parathesia persisted but had normal nerve conduction studies. Dose to the spinal nerve roots and nearby structures were estimated using a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation. Serial X-ray imaging and CT had found that the seed had further migrated to left renal hilum.CONCLUSIONS: Seed migration to vertebral venous plexus is uncommon and to our knowledge this is the third reported case. Its subsequent migration to the renal hilum is most unusual. CT with bony windows or MRI are required if this is suspected.

However visual acuity is usually determined only in narrow range of luminance levels between 160 and 320 cd/m2; therefore losses of visual acuity in other ranges of light intensity can not be detected. In a distance of 80 cm from the patients eyes, Landolt rings of varying sizes were presented on a small test field whose light intensity can be varied between 0.1 and 30,000 cd/m2. Thereby an acuity-luminance-function can be obtained. We studied such functions under different conditions of exposure time both with constant and with increasing luminance of the test field. We found that persons with normal vision can increase their visual acuity with increasing test field luminance up to a range of 5000 cd/m2. The maximum values of visual acuity under optimal lightening conditions lie (varying with age) between 2.2 and 0.9. Under pathological conditions visual acuity falls at high luminances accompanied by sensations of glare. Tests of glare sensitivity as a function of exposure time showed 4 sec to be a critical time of exposure since after 4 sec normal persons just reach their maximum visual acuity at high luminances. The underlying physiological mechanisms lead us to suppose that patients with neuronal light adaptation disturbances display a greater visual loss as a result of decreased time of exposure than those with disturbances in the ocular media. Visual acuity as well as the capacity to increase the patients visual acuity under optimal conditions of lighting were both found to be strongly age-dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to compare the performance of the ZeroGravity (ZG) system (radiation protection system composed by a suspended lead suit) against the use of standard protection (lead apron (LA), thyroid shield, lead eyeglasses, table skirts, and ceiling suspended shield) in neuroangiography procedures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiation exposure data were prospectively collected in consecutive neuroendovascular procedures between December 2014 and February 2015. Operator No 1 was assigned to the use of an LA (plus lead glasses, thyroid shield, and a 1 mm hanging shield at the groin) while operator No 2 utilized the ZG system. Dosimeters were used to measure peak skin dose for the head, thyroid, and left foot.RESULTS: The two operators performed a total of 122 procedures during the study period. The ZG operator was more commonly the primary operator compared with the LA operator (85% vs 71%; p=0.04). The mean anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and cumulative dose area product (DAP) radiation exposure as well as the mean fluoroscopy time were not statistically different between the operators' cases. The peak skin dose to the head of the operator with LA was 2.1 times higher (3380 vs 1600 muSv), while the thyroid was 13.9 (4460 vs 320 muSv), the mediastinum infinitely (520 vs 0 muSv), and the foot 3.3 times higher (4870 vs 1470 muSv) compared with the ZG operator, leading to an overall accumulated dose 4 times higher. The ratio of cumulative operator received dose/total cumulative DAP was 2.5 higher on the LA operator.CONCLUSIONS: The ZG radiation protection system leads to substantially lower radiation exposure to the operator in neurointerventional procedures. However, substantial exposure may still occur at the level of the lens and thyroid to justify additional protection.",Excluded

1589,"Quantifying the impact of antiangiogenic therapy on hypoxia and implications for radiation therapy in glioblastoma multiforme with a biomathematical model. Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor. As angiogenesis is a major hallmark of GBM, it can be inferred that hypoxia plays a prominent role in the progression of the disease. However, due to difficulty in assessing hypoxia, the development and evolution of hypoxia has not been well studied for GBM. 18F-Fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET indirectly measures hypoxia. It is known that hypoxia reduces the efficacy of radiation therapy, and one current strategy being explored is to combine anti-angiogenic therapy and radiation therapy. However, it is unclear whether anti-angiogenic therapy is ultimately reducing or increasing hypoxia nor is it clear how long the effects last. Method(s): We have developed a spatio-temporal biomathematical model for glioma proliferation and invasion that incorporates the angiogenic cascade. In this context, we can simulate the action of anti-angiogenic treatment, such as bevacizumab, by modifying the availability of angiogenic factors. By applying a pharmacokinetic model for the uptake of FMISO to the simulation results, we can generate the corresponding FMISO-PET images during and after anti-angiogenic therapy to compare with what would be seen in the clinic. Result(s): Simulation results for a wide range of tumor kinetics demonstrated that hypoxia in general decreased during anti-angiogenic therapy. However, the rates at which it decreased and the time for the hypoxia to return to pre-treatment levels were not uniform. Conclusion(s): Dynamic understanding of anti-angiogenic therapy effects on vascular normalization and hypoxia suggest that optimal timing of radiation therapy and anti-angiogenic therapies would vary by patient. This biomathematical model can be tuned to individual patients' tumors and provide similar information as a FMISO-PET image and also give insight into the dynamics of the hypoxia over time. Such insight could be invaluable to patient-specific treatment planning for combining radiation with antiangiogenics.",Excluded

Microglia are known to play an important role in the CNS cytokine network, and their response after irradiation may be associated with the development of radiation-induced tissue damage.

We investigated the effect of gamma-irradiation on microglia stimulated with Zymosan A and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which alone induce the expression of some cytokines and neurotoxic products by microglial cells. In the resting condition (ramified microglia), radiation had no effect on the mRNA level corresponding to cytokines such as IL1beta or IL-6, although TGF-beta1 mRNA was minimally enhanced by irradiation. However, in the activated microglia (amoeboid microglia) stimulated with Zymosan A, radiation-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was increased about two-fold in comparison with non-irradiation. IL-1beta was slightly induced by 2 Gy irradiation, but was not induced by higher doses. TGF-beta1 mRNA was not enhanced by radiation following Zymosan stimulation. In the LPS-stimulated condition, IL-6 mRNA was induced only by 2 Gy of irradiation, but no change in the expression of other genes was detected. These results suggested that radiation exerted different effects on cytokine gene transcription in microglia depending on their morphological state.",Included

We develop a proposed taxonomy of space arts, based on prior taxonomies, and provide specific exemplars of space art developed by artists in space or for use by astronauts in space. Using examples of space art since the birth of the space age, we discuss (1) how human survival in extreme environments requires investment in the space arts, driven by consideration of various biopsychosocial factors and (2) how new scientific and engineering discoveries; such as the detection of air current patterns with paper airplanes in zero gravity, could be consequences or examples of creative thinking driven by artists in the various types of space art. We conclude by discussing possible benefits of space art, future research applications, and advocate that all space actors, government or private, involve artists in all projects beyond the Karman Boundary of the Earth's atmosphere.",Excluded

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ideally suited to imaging the patient with painful hip arthroplasty due to its superior soft tissue contrast, multiplanar capabilities, and lack of ionizing radiation. MRI is the most accurate imaging modality in the assessment of periprosthetic osteolysis and wear-induced synovitis, and can also assess regional tendons and neurovascular structures. This article discusses the technical aspects of MRI around metallic implants as well as the appearance of potential complications following hip arthroplasty, including osteolysis, wear-induced synovitis, infection, hemarthrosis, fracture, loosening, component displacement, heterotopic ossification, tendinopathy, and neurovascular impingement.

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a highly conformal form of radiation therapy designed to deliver a high dose in a single treatment to the target volume while sparing adjacent normal tissues. Its role in the treatment of brain metastases continues to be defined, but the recently reported RTOG 95-08 trial demonstrated a survival benefit with the addition of SRS to whole-brain radiation therapy in select patients with a single brain metastasis, as well as a local control and palliative benefit in select patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases.

1598,"Antiphosphatidylserine antibody combined with irradiation damages tumor blood vessels and induces tumor immunity in a rat model of glioblastoma. PURPOSE: The vascular targeting antibody bavituximab is being combined with chemotherapy in clinical trials in cancer patients. Bavituximab targets the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylserine, complexed with beta2-glycoprotein I. Phosphatidylserine is normally intracellular but becomes exposed on the luminal surface of vascular endothelium in tumors. Phosphatidylserine exposure on tumor vessels is increased by chemotherapy and irradiation. Here, we determined whether treatment with the murine equivalent of bavituximab, 2aG4, combined with irradiation can suppress tumor growth in a rat model of glioblastoma.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: F98 glioma cells were injected into the brains of syngeneic rats where they grow initially as a solid tumor and then infiltrate throughout the brain. Rats with established tumors were treated with 10 Gy whole brain irradiation and 2aG4.RESULTS: Combination treatment doubled the median survival time of the rats, and 13% of animals were rendered disease free. Neither treatment given individually was as effective. We identified two mechanisms. First, irradiation induced phosphatidylserine exposure on tumor blood vessels and enhanced antibody-mediated destruction of tumor vasculature by monocytes/macrophages. Second, the antibody treatment induced immunity to F98 tumor cells, which are normally weakly immunogenic. Surviving rats were immune to rechallenge with F98 tumor cells. In vitro, 2aG4 enhanced the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to generate F98-specific cytotoxic T cells. Phosphatidylserine exposure, which is induced on tumor cells by irradiation, likely suppresses tumor antigen presentation, and 2aG4 blocks this tolerogenic effect.CONCLUSION: Bavituximab combined with radiotherapy holds promise as a vascular targeting and immune enhancement strategy for the treatment of human glioblastoma.",Excluded

Background: Quite a number of in vitro experiments indicate that low dose He-Ne laser can stimulate the cell growth and blood vessel regeneration therefore to improve the damages caused by ischemia. However, it needs further study on the in vivo experiments. Objective(s): To study the protective effects of intravascular low dose laser irradiation to ischemic reperfusion of rats and explore its mechanism. Design(s): A randomised and controlled trial based on experimental animals. Setting(s): Department of Neurology of a hospital of a university. Materials: The experiment was completed in the Surgery Experimental Animal Center of West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Healthy male SD rats of class II which aged between 5 to 6 months with weight of 372 to 418 grams [mean weight(388.48 +/- 10. 57) g] were provided by Animal Research Center of Sichuan University.

1601,Effect of Static Magnetic Field of Electric Vehicles on Driving Performance and on Neuro-Psychological Cognitive Functions. Human neuropsychological reactions and brain activities when driving electric vehicles (EVs) are considered as an issue for traffic and public safety purposes; this paper examined the effect of the static magnetic field (SMF) derived from EVs. A lane change task was adopted to evaluate the driving performance; and the driving reaction time test and the reaction time test were adopted to evaluate the variation of the neuro-psychological cognitive functions. Both the sham and the real exposure conditions were performed with a 350 muT localized SMF in this study; 17 student subjects were enrolled in this single-blind experiment. Electroencephalographs (EEGs) of the subjects were adopted and recorded during the experiment as an indicator of the brain activity for the variations of the driving performance and of the cognitive functions. Results of this study have indicated that the impact of the given SMF on both the human driving performance and the cognitive functions are not considerable; and that there is a correlation between beta sub-band of the EEGs and the human reaction time in the analysis.,Excluded

1603,"Thermoregulation in pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana, Ord) in winter. Conservation of energy is a prerequisite thermoregulatory strategy for survival in northern hemisphere winters. We have used thermistor/data logger assemblies to measure temperatures in the brain, carotid artery, jugular vein and abdominal cavity, in pronghorn antelope to determine their winter body temperature and to investigate whether the carotid rete has a survival role. Over the study period mean black globe and air temperature were -0.5+/-3.2 degrees C and -2.0+/-3.4 degrees C, respectively, and mean daytime solar radiation was approximately 186 W m(-2). Brain temperature (T(brain), 39.3+/-0.3 degrees C) was higher than carotid blood temperature (T(carotid), 38.5+/-0.4 degrees C), and higher than jugular temperature (T(jugular), 37.9+/-0.7 degrees C). Minimum T(brain) (38.5+/-0.4 degrees C) and T(carotid) (37.8+/-0.2 degrees C) in winter were higher than the minimum T(brain) (37.7+/-0.5 degrees C) and T(carotid) (36.4+/-0.8 degrees C) in summer that we have reported previously. Compared with summer, winter body temperature patterns were characterized by an absence of selective brain cooling (SBC), a higher range of T(brain), a range of T(carotid) that was significantly narrower (1.8 degrees C) than in summer (3.1 degrees C), and changes in T(carotid) and T(brain) that were more highly correlated (r=0.99 in winter vs r=0.83 in summer). These findings suggest that in winter the effects of the carotid rete are reduced, which eliminates SBC and prevents independent regulation of T(brain), thus coupling T(brain) to T(carotid). The net effect is that T(carotid) varies little. A possible consequence is depression of metabolism, with the survival advantage of conservation of energy. These findings also suggest that the carotid rete has wider thermoregulatory effects than its traditional SBC function.",Excluded
1604,"Radiosensitization by BRAF inhibitor therapy-mechanism and frequency of toxicity in melanoma patients. BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that ionizing radiation may be associated with unexpected side-effects in melanoma patients treated with concomitant BRAF inhibitors. A large multicenter analysis was carried out to generate reliable safety data and elucidate the mechanism.METHODS: A total of 161 melanoma patients from 11 European skin cancer centers were evaluated for acute and late toxicity, of whom 70 consecutive patients received 86 series of radiotherapy with concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy. To further characterize and quantify a possible radiosensitization by BRAF inhibitors, blood samples of 35 melanoma patients were used for individual radiosensitivity testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization of chromosomal breaks after ex vivo irradiation.RESULTS: With radiotherapy and concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy the rate of acute radiodermatitis >=2degree was 36% and follicular cystic proliferation was seen in 13% of all radiotherapies. Non-skin toxicities included hearing disorders (4%) and dysphagia (2%). Following whole-brain radiotherapy, rates of radiodermatitis >=2degree were 44% and 8% (P < 0.001) for patients with and without BRAF inhibitor therapy, respectively. Concomitant treatment with vemurafenib induced acute radiodermatitis >=2degree more frequently than treatment with dabrafenib (40% versus 26%, P = 0.07). In line with these findings, analysis of chromosomal breaks ex vivo indicated significantly increased radiosensitivity for patients under vemurafenib (P = 0.004) and for patients switched from vemurafenib to dabrafenib (P = 0.002), but not for patients on dabrafenib only. No toxicities were reported after stereotactic treatment.CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy with concomitant BRAF inhibitor therapy is feasible with an acceptable increase in toxicity.

Two of six cats receiving small-field, single-dose, brain irradiation of 35 Gy with 6 MeV photons developed brain abnormalities in the irradiated area on MR images at 6 and 8 months, respectively, after treatment. The lesions were of high intensity on T2-weighted images and did not enhance after IV administration of gadolinium-DTPA. An additional lesion in one of these cats displayed high signal on T2-weighted images and enhanced on T1-weighted images after IV gadolinium-DTPA. Pathologic correlation revealed that the nonenhancing T2-weighted lesions consisted of edema or demyelinated regions without inflammation while the gadolinium-enhanced lesion demonstrated necrosis with inflammatory infiltrate. Focal brain irradiation may produce noninflammatory demyelination and necrosis. These histologic entities may be potentially distinguished on MR with IV gadolinium-DTPA.",Included

1607,"Space motion sickness: incidence, etiology, and countermeasures. Space motion sickness is experienced by 60% to 80% of space travelers during their first 2 to 3 days in microgravity and by a similar proportion during their first few days after return to Earth. Space motion sickness symptoms are similar to those in other forms of motion sickness; they include: pallor, increased body warmth, cold sweating, malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and anorexia. These are important because they may affect the operational performance of astronauts. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain space motion sickness: the fluid shift hypothesis and the sensory conflict hypothesis. The fluid shift hypothesis suggests that space motion sickness results from the cranial shifting of body fluids resulting from the loss of hydrostatic pressure gradients in the lower body when entering microgravity. The cranial fluid shifts lead to visible puffiness in the face, and are thought to increase the intracranial pressure, the cerebrospinal-fluid pressure or the inner ear fluid pressures, altering the response properties of the vestibular receptors and inducing space motion sickness. The sensory conflict hypothesis suggests that loss of tilt-related otolith signals upon entry into microgravity causes a conflict between actual and anticipated signals from sense organs subserving spatial orientation. Such sensory conflicts are thought to induce motion sickness in other environments. Space motion sickness is usually treated using pharmaceuticals, most of which have undesirable side effects. Further studies elucidating the underlying mechanism for space motion sickness may be required for developing new treatments. [References: 19]",Excluded

The cyclooxygenase-2 isoform (COX-2) was found recently to be constitutively expressed in the guinea pig inner ear. To gain knowledge about its role in sound perception, alterations in the COX-2 level of moderate noise-stimulated cochleae were determined. Staining intensities were quantified in different regions using an immunohistochemical staining procedure and computer-assisted system. After 70 dB and 90 dB noise exposure for 1 h at 8000 Hz, COX-2 downregulation was observed in the organ of Corti, which was most prominent in Deiters' cells near Hensen cells and outer hair cells. In pillar cells, COX-2 levels were only slightly reduced after 70 dB but strongly diminished after 90 dB exposure. In Hensen cells, COX-2 was downregulated after 70 dB stimulation, revealing a decreasing COX-2 content from the third to the first turn of the cochlea and a homogeneously reduced enzyme expression in all three turns after 90 dB. The COX-2 content in inner hair cells was nearly identical to unexposed cochleae after 70 dB exposure but significantly reduced after 90 dB stimulation. In spiral ganglion cells, stria vascularis, spiral ligament and limbus, COX-2 expression was unchanged after 70 dB and 90 dB. We suggest that alterations in COX-2 expression might contribute to diminished sensitivity at the cochlea after noise exposure to reduce subsequent noise distress, termed sound conditioning.",Excluded

Experimental results are presented which describe induction and pathogenesis of the hydro-micrencephaly in NMRI-mice after single X-irradiation with 0.9 Gy or 1.9 Gy on gestation day (gd) 12. The ultrastructural alterations in the ventricular walls are sequentially investigated up to gross developmental damage. The ventricular zone is the most sensitive region in the developing brain. Its constituting undifferentiated and proliferating cells lose their palisade like orientation and fail subsequently to differentiate into primitive neurons, glia cells, or ependymal cells. Structurally this results in the thinning of ventricular walls by more than 50% associated with periventricular oedema and a dilation of the brain ventricles by 20-60%. Damage is clearly more pronounced with the higher dose. Repair processes originate from regions with intact Zonulae adherents which give also rise to typical globular or cylindrical heterotopic structures; these are known as rosettes and made up from undifferentiated proliferating ventricular cells. Perinatally in these rosettes cell replication persists, at a time when cell production in the ventricular zone has ceased. Histological changes are most prominent in and around the telencephalic roof consisting in replacement of the ependymal lining by a felt of glial fibers, faulty myelinisation, and periventricular oedema; postnatally these structural alterations lead to hydro-micrencephaly. Results from this animal model can be translated to the human situation because the fundamental developmental processes in the brain of mammals are similar despite species related differences of the time scale.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Surgery and radiation are the mainstays of therapy for human gliomas that are the most common primary brain tumors. Most recently, cell culture and animal studies provided the first convincing evidence that radiation not only eliminates tumor cells, but also modulates the immune response and likely improves anti-tumor immunotherapy.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present an in vivo study that analyzes the effects of radiation on the immune response in tumor patients. As readout system, we utilized the reactivity of glioma patients' sera against antigen GLEA2 as the most frequent antigen immunogenic in glioblastoma patients. We established an ELISA assay to analyze reactivity of 24 glioblastoma patients over a period of several months. As control we used 30 sera from healthy donors as well as 30 sera from lung cancer patients. We compared the course of GLEA2 seroreactivity at different times prior, during and after radiation. The GLEA2 seroreactivity was increased by the time of surgery, decreased after surgery, increased again under radiation, and slightly decreased after radiation.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide in vivo evidence for an increased antibody response against tumor antigens under radiation.

Therefore the allowed radiation dosage for healthcare workers is regulated by governing agencies. Although the dosage patients receive is relatively limited, the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle still applies. ClarityIQ is an automated algorithm developed to reduce the radiation dosage used without loss of image quality. Method(s): Diagnostic coronary angiography images of the left coronary artery (LCA) were acquired in LAO 45 with 20 cranial angulation with hand injected contrast dye. Quality of ClarityIQ (50% radiation reduction) was compared with standard image acquisition (100% radiation exposure). Images were reviewed by three independent reviewers and scored on subjective image quality, good, fair, poor. Result(s): Our preliminary data demonstrate that 47 patients (mean age 62.8 +/- 11.1) were enrolled with a mean BMI of 26.6 kg/m2 +/- 3.7. All had normal kidney function (MDRD > 60) and no known previous myocardial infarction of the LCA. The image quality of the ClarityIQ images was of adequate diagnostic quality in all patients as assessed by the operator. Independent reviewers assessed the images as good in 29, fair in 18 and poor in none. Reduction in mean DAP was 58%, mean DAP of ClarityIQ was 1126 mGy.cm2 and 1955 mGy.cm2 for the standard image acquisition. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that with a novel acquisition technique that enhances the coronary tree based on a computer algorithm, adequate images can be acquired with a reduction of 58% of radiation dose. Thus resulting in less stochastic effects of radiation for the cath-lab personnel and also less deterministic effects for the patient.

The series included 24 lesions (28 treatments). The median age of the patients was 60 years (range, 24-85 years). Forty-four percent of the tumors were located in the mobile spine, 39% inside the cranium, and 17% in the sacral region. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1. The mean tumor volume was 128.0 mL (range, 12.0-457.3 mL), and the median dose of 35 Gy (range, 24.0-40.0 Gy) was delivered in 5 sessions. The median follow-up period was 46 months (range, 7-65 months).RESULTS: There were 3 significant complications in patients with previous irradiation, including infection in the surgical/radiation site (2 patients) and decreased vision (1 patient). Improvement in pain and quality of life did not reach statistical significance (alpha = 0.05). Seven patients experienced recurrence at a median of 10 months (range, 5-38 months), and 4 patients with disseminated disease died 7 to 48 months after therapy. Two patients had a partial response, whereas 9 others had stable disease. The local control rate at 65 months was 59.1%, with an overall survival of 74.3% and disease-specific survival of 88.9%. We estimated an alpha/beta ratio of 2.45 for chordomas, which supports hypofractionation.CONCLUSION: The CK/SRS safety and efficacy profile compares favorably with those of other treatment delivery systems. CK/SRS appears to reduce tumor volume, given an adequate dose. The authors recommend treatment with 40 Gy in 5 sessions to the clinical treatment volume, which includes the gross tumor volume and at least a 1-cm margin.",Excluded

High-energy radiation bombardment of intact frozen telencephalon resulted in a biphasic inactivation curve for [3H]AMPA binding. At a 5.8-Mrad radiation dose, the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding was increased (54 nM), but there was no apparent alteration in the Bmax value (2.76 pmol/mg of protein). We attribute this phenomenon to the inactivation of a high molecular weight modulatory protein that down-regulates the affinity of [3H]AMPA binding. The estimated molecular masses of the AMPA binding site and of the modulatory component were 59 and 108 kDa, respectively. Solubilisation with n-octyl-beta-glucopyranoside resulted in an increase in the Bmax (4.7 pmol/mg of protein) with no pronounced alteration in the affinity (109 nM) of [3H]AMPA binding. However, the solubilisation-induced increase in Bmax did not occur in telencephalon irradiated before solubilisation. In contrast, the increase in affinity induced by radiation treatment was still detected in solubilised extracts. These results suggest that the number and affinity of [3H]AMPA sites in chick telencephalon are closely regulated and that the modulatory systems involved are affected by both irradiation and solubilisation.",Excluded

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging showed fractures of the pelvis but were suggestive of malignancy. CT-guided bone biopsy was consistent with radiation osteonecrosis. After diagnosis and continued therapy, the patient progressed to ambulation with moderate discomfort. Failure to diagnose insufficiency fractures could lead to further pelvic irradiation, compromising already weakened bones and causing prolonged disability.",Excluded
1622,"Significant tumor volume reduction of meningiomas after stereotactic radiotherapy: Results of a prospective multicenter study. OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is well established in the treatment of cranial base meningiomas. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) offers an additional treatment option. Data for radiological regression differ, ranging from 13 to 61%. Therefore, the aims of this prospective study were to quantitatively analyze tumor volume (TV) shrinkage and to calculate determining factors. METHOD(S): Eighty-four patients were examined under equal conditions before and after SRT. Fat-saturated axial T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans with 1- to 3-mm slice thickness were used. After image fusion, TV was drawn in each slice to analyze TV shrinkage three-dimensionally by the planning system. RESULT(S): Mean TV had shrunk by 33% at 24 months (P = 0.02) and by 36% at 36 months (P = 0.0007) after SRT. With regard to half-year intervals, TV reduction decreased continuously towards a steady state (P < 0.0001). Younger age (P = 0.001) and smaller TV (P = 0.01) are determining factors. There was no correlation between TV reduction, prescribed dose, histological classification, sex, or previous operations. CONCLUSION(S): Meningiomas shrink significantly after SRT. TV shrinkage declines towards a steady state, which is not yet defined. Younger age and smaller TV are determining factors. Previous operations, sex, prescribed dose, or histological subtypes do not affect TV shrinkage. Eighteen to 24 months after irradiation, when symptoms are clinically stable, is the best time for the first magnetic resonance imaging scans evaluating tumor control and shrinkage.

1623,"The influence of mineralising radionecrosis on the dose distribution in interstitial radiation therapy of brain tumours. The influences of radionecroses arising during interstitial radiation of brain tumours with 125I, 192Ir or 198Au on dose distribution was investigated using Monte Carlo methods. The necroses have a higher density than normal tissue due to radiation-induced changes in tissue composition as well as mineral deposits. They can have a diameter of up to 1 cm around the single seeds. The higher density and changed chemical composition compared to homogeneous normal tissue leads to increased absorption of radiation around the necroses which results in a lower dose rate in the surrounding tissue. It is shown that the formation of necroses during treatment with higher energy radiation such as 192Ir (340 keV) or 198Au (400 keV) may be neglected during therapy planning as the dose rate is affected by less than 2%. If low energy radiation, e.g. 125I (28 keV) is used, the dose rate can be reduced by more than 30%. In this case the influence of the necroses on dose distribution, at least for permanent 125I implantation, may not be negligible.",Excluded

Bisphenol A (BPA) is the most important plasticizer used in many household products such as polycarbonate plastics or epoxy resins. Public and scientific concerns exist regarding the possibility that the neonatal exposure to BPA may contribute to neurobehavioral disorders. On the other hand, there is little information on the effects of low doses of ionizing radiation during critical phases of postnatal brain development, as well as the combination of radiation and environmental chemicals. In this study, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to low doses of internal radiation ((137)Cs), and/or BPA on postnatal day 10 (PND10). At the age of two months, animals were submitted to several tests to assess anxiety, activity, learning, and memory. Results showed that exposure to (137)Cs, alone or in combination with BPA, increased the anxiety-like of the animals without changing the activity levels. Animals exposed to (137)Cs showed impaired learning, and spatial memory, an impairment that was not observed in the groups co-exposed to BPA.",Excluded
1626,"Synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held under in vivo like activity levels. One of the hallmarks of auditory neurons in vivo is spontaneous activity that occurs even in the absence of any sensory stimuli. Sound-evoked bursts of discharges are thus embedded within this background of random firing. The calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) has been characterized in vitro as a fast relay that reliably fires at high stimulus frequencies (< or =800 Hz). However, inherently due to the preparation method, spontaneous activity is absent in studies using brain stem slices. Here we first determine in vivo spontaneous firing rates of MNTB principal cells from Mongolian gerbils and then reintroduce this random firing to in vitro gerbil brain stem synapses at near-physiological temperature. After conditioning synapses with afferent fiber stimulation for 2 min at Poisson averaged rates of 20, 40, and 60 Hz, we observed a number of differences in the properties of synaptic transmission between conditioned and unconditioned synapses. Foremost, we observed reduced steady-state EPSC amplitudes that depressed even further during an embedded short-stimulation train of 100, 300, or 600 Hz (a protocol that thus simulates in vitro what probably occurs at the in vivo MNTB after a short sound stimulus in a silent background). Accordingly, current-clamp, dynamic-clamp, and loose-patch recordings revealed a number of action potential failures at the postsynaptic cell during high-frequency-stimulation trains, although the initial onset of evoked activity was still transmitted with higher fidelity. We thus propose that some in vivo auditory synapses are in a tonic state of reduced EPSC amplitudes as a consequence of high spontaneous spiking and this in vivo-like conditioning has important consequences for the encoding of signals throughout the auditory pathway.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) in achieving a partial or complete remission of so-called radioresistant metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and to propose guidelines for optimal treatment Methods. During a 5-year period, 29 patients (19 male and 10 female) with 92 brain metastases from RCC underwent GKS. The median tumor volume was 4.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 0.5-14.5 cm<sup>3</sup>). Fourteen patients (48%) also underwent whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) before GKS, and two patients (6.8%) after GKS. The mean GKS dose delivered to the 50% isodose at the tumor margin was 16.8 Gy (range 13-30 Gy). All cases were categorized according to the Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification for brain metastases. Univariate analysis was performed to determine significant prognostic factors and survival. The overall median survival was 7 months after GKS treatment. Age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and controlled primary disease were not predictors of survival. Combined WBRT/GKS resulted in median survival of 18, 8.5, and 5.3 months for RPA Classes I, II, and III, respectively, compared with the median survival 7.1, 4.2, and 2.3 months for patients treated with WBRT alone. Conclusions. These results suggest that WBRT combined with GKS may improve survival in patients with brain metastases from RCC. Furthermore, this improvement in survival was seen in all RPA classes.",Excluded
1628,"Normal tissue contour variation and the dosimetric impact on radiation therapy treatment planning. Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate how variability in contouring normal tissues affects dose assessment for radiation therapy treatment planning. Materials/Methods: Computed tomography (CT) scans of individual patients treated for tumors of the brain, head and neck, thorax, pancreas and prostate were selected for this study. For each scan, a radiation oncologist, who primarily treats the disease site and a diagnostic radiologist, outlined the normal tissues (""gold"" contours) using RTOG guidelines. A total of 27 organs were delineated. Independently, five board-certified dosimetrists and one trainee then outlined the same set of contours on the individual scans. A radiation treatment plan was calculated for each of the disease sites based on PTVs, gold contours and doses defined by the physician. Dose-volume constraints were defined per RTOG protocol criteria for each disease site. Result(s): For the 27 gold organs contoured, a total of 156 organs were outlined by dosimetrists. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for each dosimetrist drawn organ and compared with the gold contours. Of the 34 dosimetric endpoints that were evaluated, 56% of the organs had dosimetric parameters that agreed to within 10% of those obtained by the gold contours. Maximum and mean dose variation for the dosimetrist's contours that were greater than 10% when compared to the dose of the gold contours were reviewed. Organs with the highest variation in dose were the optic lens maximum dose (45%) and the mandible maximum dose (40%). Moderate variation was seen for the mean left parotid gland dose (15%) and the cervical spinal cord (13%). When evaluating the prostate plan, the V80Gy, V75Gy and V65Gy for the bladder and the V70Gy and V50Gy for the rectum were obtained. Minimal variation was observed in the absolute volumes at each dose level, however the relative variation was larger (10-25%). This difference is due to the small volume of the organs receiving these doses and was determined not to be clinically relevant. Conclusion(s): The results of this study demonstrated that the normal tissue contours produced by our dosimetrists showed good dosimetric agreement with the gold contours for over half of the organs evaluated. For the remaining organs, our expectation is that the establishment of contouring competencies will ensure more accurate treatments and dose assessment in radiotherapy treatment planning and delivery.",Excluded
1629,"Requirement for Atm in ionizing radiation-induced cell death in the developing central nervous system. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration that results from mutation of the ATM gene. However, neither the normal function of ATM in the nervous system nor the biological basis of the degeneration in AT is known. Resistance to apoptosis in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Atm-/- mice was observed after ionizing radiation. This lack of death occurred in diverse regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, which is markedly affected in AT. In wild-type, but not Atm-/- mice, up-regulation of p53 coincided with cell death, suggesting that Atm-dependent apoptosis in the CNS is mediated by p53. Further, p53 null mice showed a similar lack of radiation-induced cell death in the developing nervous system. Atm may function at a developmental survival checkpoint that serves to eliminate neurons with excessive DNA damage.",Included
1630,"Characterization of Na+-activated K+ currents in larval lamprey spinal cord neurons. Potassium channels play an important role in controlling neuronal firing and synaptic interactions. Na(+)-activated K(+) (K(Na)) channels have been shown to exist in neurons in different regions of the CNS, but their physiological function has been difficult to assess. In this study, we have examined if neurons in the spinal cord possess K(Na) currents. We used whole cell recordings from isolated spinal cord neurons in lamprey. These neurons display two different K(Na) currents. The first was transient and activated by the Na(+) influx during the action potentials, and it was abolished when Na(+) channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin. The second K(Na) current was sustained and persisted in tetrodotoxin. Both K(Na) currents were abolished when Na(+) was substituted with choline or N-methyl-D-glucamine, indicating that they are indeed dependent on Na(+) influx into neurons. When Na(+) was substituted with Li(+), the amplitude of the inward current was unchanged, whereas the transient K(Na) current was reduced but not abolished. This suggests that the transient K(Na) current is partially activated by Li(+). These two K(Na) currents have different roles in controlling the action potential waveform. The transient K(Na) appears to act as a negative feedback mechanism sensing the Na(+) influx underlying the action potential and may thus be critical for setting the amplitude and duration of the action potential. The sustained K(Na) current has a slow kinetic of activation and may underlie the slow Ca(2+)-independent afterhyperpolarization mediated by repetitive firing in lamprey spinal cord neurons.",Excluded

AIMS: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of bevacizumab (BEV) on the diffusion properties of irradiated brain gliomas.MATERIALS & METHODS: Neuroimaging studies and medical records of 44 patients undergoing treatment for cerebral gliomas were reviewed. MRIs were analyzed for presence of restricted diffusion, time to onset, pattern/location, duration of restriction, and persistence of restriction post-treatment with BEV.RESULTS: Patchy confluent areas of diffusion restriction on MRI were found in 12 patients. All 12 patients received radiation therapy followed by BEV therapy. Diffusion restriction appeared 3 to 21 months after onset of radiation and 1 to 6 months after starting BEV therapy, increased in size over time, and persisted up to 23 months while on BEV. Restricted diffusion was observed in areas that received 60 Gy or more of radiation. Areas of restricted diffusion showed low T1 and increased T2 signal intensity, minimal or no contrast enhancement, and low cerebral blood volume. A thin perimeter of susceptibility outlined the restricted areas on susceptibility-weighted images in nine patients (75%). Small focal areas of tumor recurrence within larger regions of restricted diffusion were evident in only four patients (33%). In seven patients (58%) the area of restricted diffusion showed necrosis or radiation change on histology or no metabolic activity on MR spectroscopy or PET.CONCLUSION: Restricted diffusion associated with BEV-treated cerebral gliomas occurs in regions of high-dose radiation and does not indicate high-cellularity of tumor recurrence.",Excluded
1632,"Environmental toxicology: Sensitive periods of development and neurodevelopmental disorders. Development of the mammalian central nervous system is a complex process whose disruption may have severe and long-lasting consequences upon brain structure and function, potentially resulting in a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Many NDDs are known to be genetic in origin, with symptom onset and their underlying mechanisms now known to be regulated during time-dependent windows or 'critical periods' during normal brain development. However, it is increasingly evident that similar disturbances to the developing nervous system may be caused by exposure to non-genetic, environmental factors. Strikingly, at least 200 industrially applied or produced chemicals have been associated with neurotoxicity in humans and exposure to these modifying compounds, through consumer products or environmental pollution, therefore poses serious threats to public health. Through a combination of human epidemiological and animal experimental studies, we identified developmental periods for increased vulnerability to environmentally-modifying compounds and determined whether and how exposure during specific sensitive time-windows could increase the risk for the NDDs of autism, ADHD or schizophrenia in the developing organism. We report that many environmental toxicants have distinct sensitive time-windows during which exposure may disrupt critical developmental events, thereby increasing the risk of developing NDDs. The majority of these time-windows occur prenatally rather than postnatally. We propose four underlying mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, immune system dysregulation, altered neurotransmission and thyroid hormone disruption. Given the complexity of underlying mechanisms and their prenatal inception, treatment options are currently limited. Thus, we conclude that preventing early exposure to environmental toxicants, by increasing public awareness and improving government and industry guidelines, may ultimately lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of NDDs.

1633,"Changes in intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in adult rat S1 during cortical reorganization. Peripheral denervation causes significant changes in the organization of developing or adult primary somatosensory cortex (S1). However, the basic mechanisms that underlie reorganization are not well understood. Most attention has been focused on possible synaptic mechanisms associated with reorganization. However, another important determinant of cortical circuit function is the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons in the circuit. Here we document changes in the intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in cortical layer 2/3 in adult rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) after varying durations of forepaw denervation. Denervation of the forepaw induced a rapid and sustained shift in the location of the border between the forepaw and lower jaw representations of adult S1 (reorganization). Coronal slices from the reorganized region were maintained in vitro and the intrinsic properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of S1 were determined using whole cell recordings. In general, passive membrane properties were not affected by denervation; however, a variety of active properties were. The most robust changes were increases in the amplitudes of the fast and medium afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and an increase in the interval between action potentials (APs). Additional changes at some durations of denervation were observed for the AP threshold. These observations indicate that changes in intrinsic properties, mostly reflecting a decrease in overall excitation, may play a role in changes in cortical circuit properties during reorganization in adult S1, and suggest a possible role for AHPs in some of those changes.",Excluded
1634,"Genetic delivery of a miRNA cluster with polycistronic siRNAs reduces expression of epidermal growth receptor in human glioblastoma cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common malignancy of the brain, is a grade IV astrocytoma. It is one of the most rapidly growing and invasive types of glial tumors. The standard therapy includes surgical removal, radiation and chemotherapy with a median survival of about 14 months. In addition, systemic therapies are limited by the blood-brain barrier. To bypass the barrier, we are developing a gene delivery strategy to inhibit the expression of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR), which are commonly upregulated in GBM. One TKR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is overexpressed in GBM leading to uncontrolled growth and proliferation. Our approach is to recruit the RNA interference pathway. Although small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are often utilized to silence gene expression, exogenously expressed siRNAs are not an effective strategy to treat human disease due to both extracellular and intracellular nucleases as well as activation of cellular immunity against foreign nucleic acids. To bypass these degradatory mechanisms, we use a natural miRNA cluster genetic background to effectively deliver the DNA encoding multiple anti-EGFR siRNAs by inserting them into the tertiary structure of the miRNA cluster, miR-17-92. The anti-EGFR polycistronic miRNA cluster (pAAV-miR-IP1) expresses six siRNAs directed against EGFR, specifically targeting the extracellular ligand binding domain, transmembrane domain, intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and 3' untranslated region of the EGFR transcript. The vector, pAAV-miR-IP1, was transfected into the human GBM cell lines, A172 and U87MG. Results demonstrate that pAAV-miR-IP1 was expressed at high levels with a subsequent reduction in EGFR mRNA expression. Additional strategies include using the polycistronic delivery mechanism to target multiple TKRs in addition to EGFR.",Excluded

The effect of neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells on collagen-coated glass plates under intermittent light irradiation at 525 nm and 0.4 mW/cm2 of intensity was investigated. Neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was significantly suppressed when PC12 cells were cultivated under intermittent light irradiation with a total irradiation time of more than 2 min/h. No temperature increase was observed in the culture medium under either continuous or intermittent light irradiation. Therefore, suppression of neurite outgrowth under light irradiation was not due to the increase of temperature in the culture medium, but rather the effect of light on the PC12 cells, especially the signal transmittance of light to PC12 cells. The light irradiation interval also affected the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells when the total irradiation time was constant. A high extension ratio of neurite outgrowth was observed under a long time interval of nonirradiation between light irradiations (1 min of irradiation every hour) as compared with frequent light irradiation intervals (5 s of irradiation every 5 min) with the same total irradiation period per hour. The neurite outgrowth ratio was thought to be dependent on the light intensity, the total time of light irradiation in the intermittent light irradiation, and the interval of light irradiation in the intermittent light irradiation.",Excluded

OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has gained increasing relevance in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors, but many metastatic tumors contain a large cystic component and often exceed the size limit for GKS. For such lesions, the authors adopted a procedure in which stereotactic aspiration is first performed and followed immediately by GKS on the same day. In this paper, the authors describe this 1-day combined procedure and evaluate its efficacy.METHODS: Between 2005 and 2010, 25 cystic metastases in 25 patients were treated at Dokkyo Medical University. The patients first underwent MRI and stereotactic aspiration of the cyst while stationary in a Leksell stereotactic frame; immediately afterward, the patients underwent a second MR imaging session and Gamma Knife treatment. Tumor volume reduction, tumor control rate, and overall survival were examined.RESULTS: Tumor volume, including the cystic component, decreased from 8.0-64.2 cm(3) (mean 20.3 cm(3)) to 3.0-36.2 cm(3) (mean 10.3 cm(3)) following aspiration, and the volume of 24 of 25 lesions decreased to less than 16.6 cm(3), which is equivalent to the volume of a 3.16-cm sphere.

1643,"Thyroid follicular cell carcinogenesis. Ample information in experimental animals indicates a relationship between inhibition of thyroid-pituitary homeostasis and the developmental thyroid follicular cell neoplasms. This is generally the case when there are long-term reductions in circulating thyroid hormones which have triggered increases in circulating thyroid stimulating hormone. Such hormonal derangements leading to neoplasms have been produced by different regimens, including dietary iodide deficiency, subtotal thyroidectomy, and administration of natural and xenobiotic chemical substances. The carcinogenic process proceeds through a number of stages, including follicular cell hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and benign and sometimes malignant neoplasms. Given the interrelationship between the thyroid and pituitary glands, conditions that result in stimulation of the thyroid can also result in stimulation of the pituitary, with the development of hyperplastic and neoplastic changes. The progression of events leading to thyroid (and pituitary) neoplasms can be reversed under certain circumstances be reestablishing thyroid-pituitary homeostasis. Most chemicals that have induced follicular cell tumors seem to operate through inhibition of the synthesis of thyroid hormone or an increase in their degradation and removal. For some of these compounds, it appears that genotoxic reactions may not be playing a dominant role in the carcinogenic process. A seemingly small group of thyroid carcinogens seems to lack influence on thyroid-pituitary status and may in part be operating via their genotoxic potential. In contrast with the well-established relationship between thyroid-pituitary derangement and follicular cell neoplasms in animals, the state of information in humans is much less certain. At this time, ionizing radiation is the only acknowledged human thyroid carcinogen, a finding well established in experimental systems as well. Although humans respond to goitrogenic stimuli as do animals, with the development of cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and under certain circumstances nodular lesions, disagreement exists as to whether malignant transformation occurs in any predictable manner. It would seem that if humans develop thyroid tumors following long-term derangement in thyroid-pituitary status, they may be less sensitive than the commonly used animal models.

Purpose/Objective(s): Multimodality treatment results in excellent outcomes for many patients with HL and NHL; however, these survivor populations are at risk for late effects. Here, we describe patient reported outcomes after chest radiation, a treatment recognized to be associated with late effects. Materials/Methods: Patient-reported data were gathered via convenience sample frame from HL/ NHL survivors voluntarily using an Internet tool for creation of survivorship care plans. The tool requires entry of data regarding diagnosis, demographics, and treatments, and provides customized guidelines for future care. It is publically available and free, having >30,0000 total users since 2007. During use of the tool, survivors are queried regarding experience with late effects associated with specific treatments. Result(s): Of 7912 survivors using the most current version of the tool (2011-2014), 9% (710) were HL or NHL survivors (32% and 68%, respectively). Of these, 61% were female, 81% Caucasian, 88% US residents, with median diagnosis age 29y (R18-51) for HL survivors and 52y (R18-91) for NHL, and median fu 9y and 4 y, respectively. Per report, 11% had previous survivorship information and 20% had received a treatment summary; current healthcare being provided by an oncologist only for 47%, PCP only for 13%, both for 36%, and neither for 3%. Chemotherapy was delivered to 89% of HL and 91% of NHL survivors, and radiation to 66% and 29%, respectively. Of those receiving radiation, 78% HL and 76% NHL survivors received chest/mantle RT (n = 246). When users were queried regarding outcomes, 86% reported being free of cancer, 10% with recurrent or secondary malignancy, and 4% with metastatic disease. Patients who had received chest RT reported: hyper or hypothyroidism (25%), thyroid nodules (10%), speaking/swallowing changes (19%), heart disease (15%), pulmonary fibrosis or pneumonitis (8%), and skin cancers within the radiation field (6%). Six of 246 reported secondary breast cancers (2%), compared to zero in the group not receiving chest RT, with median time to breast cancer 11.5y (R 1-32y). Receipt of chemotherapy was associated with: Chronic fatigue (46%), perceived cognitive change (43%), peripheral neuropathy (28%), sexual change (13% of male users, 27% of female), osteoporosis (13%) and heart disease (5%). Conclusion(s): Survivors of HL and NHL remain at significant risk for late effects, despite excellent disease outcomes overall. Radiation to the chest appears significantly associated with patient-reported late effects including thyroid, heart, and lung disease, although more survivors report problematic fatigue, cognitive changes, neuropathies, and sexual changes after chemotherapy. These data indicate need for improved survivor support both for known radiation late effects, and for other negative outcomes that may be subtle to clinicians, but significantly impact quality of life.",Excluded

By scanning this light beam, we could map the distribution of neurons associated with limb movement. With this approach we could simultaneously define motor maps controlling two limbs and could reproducibly generate such cortical motor maps over periods of weeks. This method allows non-invasive mapping of brain circuitry in living animals and could help define the connection between behavior and brain circuitry.",Excluded
1647,"Counteraction by repetitive daily exposure to static magnetism against sustained blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. In rat hippocampal neurons cultured with the antagonist for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors dizocilpine (MK-801) for 8 days in vitro (DIV), a significant decrease was seen in the expression of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) as well as mRNA for both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), in addition to decreased viability. MK-801 not only decreased the expression of the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors but also increased NR2A expression, without affecting NR2B expression. Repetitive daily exposure to static magnetic fields at 100 mT for 15 min led to a decrease in the expression of MAP-2, without significantly affecting cell viability or the expression of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and GAP-43. However, the repetitive magnetism prevented decreases in both BDNF mRNA and MAP-2 and additionally increased the expression of NR2A subunit, without altering NR1 expression in neurons cultured in the presence of MK-801. Repetitive magnetism was also effective in preventing the decrease by MK-801 in the ability of NMDA to increase intracellular free Ca2+ ions, without affecting the decrease in the maximal response. These results suggest that repetitive magnetism may at least in part counteract the neurotoxicity of MK-801 through modulation of the expression of particular NMDA receptor subunits in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.",Excluded
1648,"Functional alterations in immature cultured rat hippocampal neurons after sustained exposure to static magnetic fields. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, gradual increases were seen in the expression of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), in proportion to increased duration, up to 9 days in vitro (DIV). Sustained exposure to static magnetic fields at 100 mT for up to 9 DIV significantly decreased expression of MAP-2 and NeuN in cultured rat hippocampal neurons without markedly affecting GAP-43 expression. Although a significant increase was seen in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampal neuronal preparations cultured for 6-9 DIV under sustained magnetism, GFAP and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression were not affected markedly in cultured astrocytes prepared from rat hippocampus and neocortex, irrespective of cellular maturity. No significant alteration was seen in cell survivability of hippocampal neurons or astrocytes cultured under sustained magnetism. In hippocampal neurons cultured for 3 DIV under sustained magnetism, marked mRNA expression was seen for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits, NR1, NR2A-2C, NR2D, and NR3A. In addition, significant potentiation of the ability of NMDA to increase intracellular free Ca(2+) ions was observed. Differential display analysis revealed a significant decrease in mRNA expression for the transcription factor ALF1 in response to sustained magnetism for 3 DIV. These results suggest that sustained exposure to static magnetic fields may affect cellular functionality and maturity in immature cultured rat hippocampal neurons through modulation of expression of particular NMDA receptor subunits.",Excluded
1649,"Gel-based proteomics of unilateral irradiated striatum after gamma knife surgery. Gamma knife surgery (GKS) is used for the treatment of various brain disorders. The biological effects of focal gamma ray irradiation on targeted or surrounding areas in the brain are not well-known. In the present study, we evaluated protein expression changes in the unilateral irradiated (60 Gy) striatum in rat. Striata of irradiated and control brains were dissected 16 h post-irradiation for analysis by large-format two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE). In parallel, we also examined the un-targeted contralateral striatum over the control for potential changes in proteins patterns that may have occurred due to the effects of irradiation to the unilateral striatum. A total of 17 reproducible and differentially expressed silver nitrate-stained protein spots in the irradiated striatum was detected on 2-D gel. Their subsequent analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-LC-MS/MS) resulted in the identification of 13 nonredundant proteins. Interestingly, out of these 13 changed proteins, 2 proteins were also detected in the contralateral striatum. Some of the significantly changed proteins identified were creatine kinase, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (PDA3), and peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2). Western analysis with anti-PDA3 and anti-Prx2 antibodies revealed 4 and 2 cross-reacting protein spots on 2-D gel blots. Interestingly, after GKS, in the irradiated and un-irradiated striata, these spots showed a shift toward the acidic side, suggesting post-translational modifications. Taken together, these results indicate that unilateral irradiation during GKS triggers molecular changes in the bilateral striata.",Included
1650,"Colored lenses suppress blue light-emitting diode light-induced damage in photoreceptor-derived cells. Blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in liquid crystal displays emit high levels of blue light, exposure to which is harmful to the retina. Here, we investigated the protective effects of colored lenses in blue LED light-induced damage to 661W photoreceptor-derived cells. We used eight kinds of colored lenses and one lens that reflects blue light. Moreover, we evaluated the relationship between the protective effects of the lens and the transmittance of lens at 464 nm. Lenses of six colors, except for the SY, PN, and reflective coating lenses, strongly decreased the reduction in cell damage induced by blue LED light exposure. The deep yellow lens showed the most protective effect from all the lenses, but the reflective coating lens and pink lens did not show any effects on photoreceptor-derived cell damage. Moreover, these results were correlated with the lens transmittance of blue LED light (464 nm). These results suggest that lenses of various colors, especially deep yellow lenses, may protect retinal photoreceptor cells from blue LED light in proportion to the transmittance for the wavelength of blue LED and the suppression of reactive oxygen species production and cell damage.",Excluded

A 70-year-old woman was referred to our department due to a solitary mediastinal tumor which gradually grew near the site of anastomosis for 8 years after radical surgery of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. It was difficult to distinguish the lymph node recurrence of esophageal cancer from another tumor of unknown primary origin. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the tumor was diagnosed to be neuroendocrine carcinoma. She received concurrent chemoradiotherapy with etoposide plus cisplatin.

1652,"Relative contributions of radiation and cisplatin-based chemotherapy to sensorineural hearing loss in head-and-neck cancer patients. PURPOSE: To investigate the risk of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in patients with head-and-neck cancer and treated with radiation therapy (RT) or concomitant cisplatin-based chemoradiation, the relationship among SNHL and radiation dose to the cochlea, the use of two common cisplatin dose regimens.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 62 head-and-neck cancer patients treated with curative intent were included in this prospective study. Of the patients, 21 received RT alone, 27 received 40 mg/m(2) weekly cisplatin, 13 received 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks during RT, and 1 received RT with weekly epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor antibody. The effect of chemotherapy and RT dose on hearing was determined using a model that accounted for the age and variability between each ear for each patient.RESULTS: We constructed a model to predict dose-dependent hearing loss for RT or cisplatin-based chemotherapy either alone or in combination. For patients only receiving RT, no significant hearing loss was found at doses to the cochlea of less than 40 Gy. Patients receiving 100 mg/m(2) or 40 mg/m(2) of cisplatin chemotherapy had an estimated +21.5 dB and +9.5 dB hearing loss at 8,000 Hz with low radiation doses (10 Gy), which rose to +38.4 dB and +18.9 dB for high radiation doses (40 Gy).CONCLUSIONS: Use of RT alone with doses of less than 40 Gy did not result in clinically significant hearing loss. High-frequency SNHL was profoundly damaged in patients who received concomitant cisplatin when doses of 100 mg/m(2) were used. The threshold cochlear dose for hearing loss with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and RT was predicted to be 10 Gy. The inner ear radiation dose constraints and cisplatin dose intensity should be considered in the treatment of advanced head-and-neck cancer.",Excluded
1653,"Enhancement of ERK phosphorylation and photic responses in Vc/C1 neurons of a migraine model. Although it is well known that migraine pain is enhanced by photic stimulation of the eye, the mechanisms underlying this response are not yet understood. Noxious stimulation to the dura is known to activate trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis and upper cervical spinal cord (Vc/C1) neurons, causing migraine pain. Intense photic stimulation to the eye is also known to activate certain Vc/C1 neurons, thus increasing migraine pain. In this study, we hypothesized that Vc/C1 neurons receiving noxious dural input would be further activated by intense photic stimulation, resulting in the enhancement of migraine pain. However, mechanisms underlying the interactions between dural and photic sensory information in Vc/C1 neurons is unknown. To evaluate the above hypothesis, we studied phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) -immunoreactive (IR) cells in Vc/C1 in dural mustard oil (DMO)-administrated rats. The change in neuronal excitability of Vc/C1 nociceptive neurons receiving input from the dura in DMO rats was examined and tested if those neurons were modulated by intense flush light stimulation. There were many pERK-IR cells in the lateral portion of Vc/C1 after MO administration to the dura. Flashlight presentation to the eye in DMO rats caused an enhancement of ERK phosphorylation in Vc/C1 neurons and pERK-IR cells were significantly suppressed after intracisternal administration of MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. Dura-light sensitive (DL) neurons were recorded in the lateral portion of Vc/C1 and photic responses of DL neurons were significantly enhanced following dural MO administration. These findings indicate that DL Vc/C1 neurons in DMO rats intensified their responses to intense photic stimulation and that ERK phosphorylation in Vc/C1 neurons receiving noxious dural input increased with intense photic stimulation, suggesting that Vc/C1 nociceptive neurons are involved in the enhancement of dural nociception associated with intense light stimulation.",Excluded
1654,"Clinical approach and surgical strategy for spinal disorders in pregnant women. Introduction: Spinal diseases that require urgent surgical treatment are rare during pregnancy. There are many important diagnostic and therapeutic aspects that must be taken into account in such situations, especially if there is an acute indication for surgery. The data is available only in the form of case reports. Method(s): The study included consecutive pregnant patients who underwent spinal surgery at five neurosurgical high-volume centers between 2010 and 2017. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical data were derived from medical records. Result(s): Overall, 23 pregnant patients were assigned to acute spinal surgery. Two of them underwent preoperative cesarian section in the 34th and 32th week. The other 21 patients underwent surgery during pregnancy. Three patients were operated upon twice or more during the same pregnancy. The median age was 33 years (min 22, max 41 years). The median gestational age was 13 completed weeks (min 7, max 34 weeks). The indications were: n = 14 lumbar herniated intervertebral discs presenting with cauda equina syndrome in 4 cases, high graded motor deficit in 7 cases, and acute pain in 3 cases; n = 4 unstable spine injuries; n = 1 intramedullary tumor with paraparesis; n = 1 paraspinal infection; n = 1 swann cell nerve root tumor presenting with higher graded paresis. Perioperative pregnancy monitoring was done with an ultrasound or ultrasound plus CTG after the 24th week of gestation in the majority of cases. All surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia (balanced anaesthesia n = 12, total intravenous anaesthesia n = 9). Median duration of surgery was 90 min (min 41, max 240). 15 patients were placed in a prone position and 6 in a right or left lateral decubitus position depending on the gestational age and the type of surgery. In 9 cases no intraoperative fluoroscopy was done, in 12 cases fluoroscopic verficiation of spine level or guidance of instrumentation placement was performed with a median fluoroscopic time of 6 s (min 1, max 24 s). No postoperative neurosurgical complications occured. Two patients underwent medical abortion due to radiation exposure before the pregnancy was diagnosed. Among the other 19 patients, 2 suffered transient gestational diabetes, and one patient presented with vaginal bleeding without any signs for fetal complications. According to our current follow-up data, no miscarriages, stillbirths or other severe obstetric complications occured during the further courses of pregnancy. All patients improved neurologically after the surgery. Conclusion(s): Spinal surgical procedures during pregnancy seem to be generally safe. Nevertheless, the indication for surgery has to be very strict and surgical procedures during pregnany should be reserved for emergency cases with acute or threatening neurological deficit. For pregnant patients the surgical strategy should be individually tailored for the mother and the fetus.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Whereas 25 to 50% of selected patients with gynecologic tumors who relapse centrally in an irradiated pelvis can be salvaged by exenteration, postirradiation recurrence infiltrating the pelvic side wall generally has been fatal. We have designed the combined operative and radiotherapeutic treatment (CORT) procedure for the treatment of postirradiation recurrence infiltrating the pelvic wall and developed several new techniques for its realization. The aim of the surgery is as follows: (1) total resection of the tumor with only a microscopic margin (R1) at the pelvic wall, preserving the bony pelvis and the neurovascular support of the leg; (2) modulation of the therapeutic index for a second high-dose irradiation of the pelvic wall by transferring autologous tissue from the abdomen or the thigh, and (3) reconstruction of pelvic organ functions lost due to tumor resection. The tumor bed is irradiated postoperatively with brachytherapy through transcutaneous guide tubes implanted at the pelvic wall.METHODS: Between April 1989 and December 1994, we treated 48 patients with postirradiation recurrent or persistent gynecologic malignancies infiltrating the pelvic wall with CORT and followed them prospectively with the following endpoints: tumor control, survival, complications, and quality of life.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 33 months (range, 3-71 months), the 5-year survival probability calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method was 44%. The overall local control rate was 68%, and 85% in the last 25 patients in the series. The censored severe complication rate at 5 years was 33%. No patient died as a consequence of the treatment. Quality of life was self-assessed with a validated questionnaire by 15 patients without evidence of disease, and was rated with a total of 74% of the maximum score points. Age of the patient, state of resection at the pelvic wall (R1 vs. R2), and recurrent tumor size independently influenced tumor progression after CORT in this series.CONCLUSIONS: CORT appears to be a feasible, innovative treatment with long term survival potential and acceptable quality of life for selected patients with postirradiation gynecologic tumor recurrence infiltrating the pelvic wall. R1 resection of the tumor at the pelvic wall is mandatory; however, the reconstruction options within the pelvis are limited.",Excluded

Seventeen patients received previous radiation therapy with an average dose of 48.5 Grey (Gy) and an average latency period of 15 years between initial therapy and GBM diagnosis. Of these 17, four white females fit all four attribution criteria for radiation-induced GBM. Two had been treated with radiation for prolactinomas, one for pinealoma and one for squamous cell cancer of the ethmoid sinus. The addition of these four case studies to the previously published descriptions of 80 cases of gliomas, 36 of which were GBM, subsequent to radiation therapy provides additional support for considering therapeutic radiation as a risk factor for GBM development.",Included

Objective : To investigate the risks and pattern of evolution of peritumoral brain edema (PTE) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for asymptomatic intracranial meningiomas. Methods : A retrospective study was conducted on 320 patients (median age 56 years, range 24-87 years) who underwent primary Gamma Knife radiosurgery for asymptomatic meningiomas between 1998 and 2012. The median tumor volume was 2.7 cc (range 0.2-10.5 cc) and the median follow-up was 48 months (range 24-168 months). Volumetric data sets for tumors and PTE on serial MRIs were analyzed. The edema index (EI) was defined as the ratio of the volume of PTE including tumor to the tumor volume, and the relative edema indices (rEIs) were calculated from serial EIs normalized against the baseline EI. Risk factors for PTE were analyzed using logistic regression. Results : Newly developed or increased PTE was noted in 49 patients (15.3%), among whom it was symptomatic in 28 patients (8.8%). Tumor volume larger than 4.2 cc (p<0.001), hemispheric tumor location (p=0.005), and pre-treatment PTE (p<0.001) were associated with an increased risk of PTE. rEI reached its maximum value at 11 months after SRS and decreased thereafter, and symptoms resolved within 24 months in most patients (85.7%). Conclusion : Caution should be exercised in decision-making on SRS for asymptomatic meningiomas of large volume (>4.2 cc), of hemispheric location, or with pre-treatment PTE. PTE usually develops within months, reaches its maximum degree until a year, and resolves within 2 years after SRS. Copyright © 2015 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded
1662,"A patient questionnaire for radiation-induced brachial plexopathy. We analyzed the usefulness of a symptom questionnaire to screen for radiation-induced brachial plexopathy (RIBP) after breast cancer treatment. Four questions addressed distal and proximal paresis: impaired hand functions, problems raising the arm, carrying weights, and lifting objects from a high shelf. Eighty-one relapse-free patients were neurologically examined. Treatment was mastectomy (51%) or breast-conserving surgery (49%), radiotherapy to the supraclavicular +/- axilla with median 60 Gy maximum dose. Sixty-five subsequent control patients had breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy to the breast only with 55 Gy median dose. Median follow up was 10 and 7.4 years, respectively. Sixteen patients had RIBP, 7 had Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 1, 4 grade 2, 3 grade 3, and 2 grade 4 RIBP. Thirty-seven patients had fibrosis and 32 had arm edema. Four patients with RIBP had no fibrosis (n = 2) or fibrosis of the axilla only (n = 2). Specificity of the question ""impaired hand functions"" for RIBP was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.78); sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96). Specificity of the question ""raising the arm"" was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.9-0.99) and sensitivity was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04-0.45); the rate of false-positive control patients was 3%. In multivariate analysis, ""impaired hand functions"" and fibrosis were independent indicators of RIBP (P <0.005). Patients with breast irradiation only stated moderate/pronounced impaired hand functions; and problems carrying weights and lifting objects from a high shelf in 38%, 58%, and 77%, not significantly different from patients with RIBP or the patients with supraclavicular radiation. RIBP is not necessarily associated with fibrosis. The aim of the questionnaire was screening of a population at risk for RIBP. In this group, the question ""problems raising the arm"" detected severe RIBP with high specificity. Negation of ""impaired hand functions"" excludes RIBP. Both questions should be included in follow-up questionnaires.",Excluded

The modification of the ultraviolet blocking of sodium channels and of the ultraviolet-induced potential shift of the gating parameters by means of the sulfhydryl compounds l-cysteine and 2-mercaptoethanol was investigated in the node of Ranvier under voltage-clamp conditions. The UV wavelength was 280 nm. The radiation-induced potential shift of the voltage-dependent gating parameters was prevented or even reversed by the action of the sulfhydryl compounds (internal application), while the blocking effect was not affected. It is concluded that the two radiation effects are caused by two separate photoreactions. Internally applied N-ethylmaleimide, binding specifically to protein-SH groups, exhibits an effect similar to the ultraviolet-induced potential shift, without affecting the maximum sodium permeability. Therefore, the ultraviolet-induced potential shift might be caused by a photocatalyzed oxidation of -SH groups of membrane proteins changing the surface charge density at the inner side of the nodal membrane.",Excluded

Four days later, when both the cellular and the humoral immune responses were impaired, they received an i.v. infusion of either phenobarbital (0.8 mg/min), ethanol (16.3 mg/min), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 0.618 mg/min), or theophylline (as aminophylline; 2 mg/min). The infusion was stopped at the onset of the pharmacologic end point--loss of righting reflex for the depressant agents or maximal seizures for the stimulant drugs--and the concentrations of the neuroactive drugs at that point were determined. In the ethanol experiment, blood samples were also taken upon awakening. The radiation-induced immunosuppression significantly decreased the CNS sensitivity to the depressant action of both phenobarbital and ethanol as indicated by the higher CSF phenobarbital concentrations required to induce sleep in the irradiated rats versus controls (156 +/- 4 vs 133 +/- 5 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.05), and the higher serum ethanol concentrations at the onset and offset of sleep in the immunosuppressed group versus control values (4.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.68 +/- 0.01 vs 3.79 +/- 0.17 and 1.32 +/- 0.9 mg/mL, respectively; P < 0.04).

1666,"SIRT in primary and metastatic liver tumors. Introduction: The liver is one of the most commonly involved organs for metastatic disease. The Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is EU approved since 2002 for treatment of primary or secondary hepatic malignancy. Methods and Results: The procedure exploits a normal physiological process: Healthy liver tissue receives most of its blood supply via the portal vein, while liver tumors receive the majority of their blood supply from the hepatic artery. The microscopic spheres, each approximately 15 to 35mum in diameter, are bonded to yttrium-90 (Y-90), a pure beta emitter with a physical half-life of 64 hours. The microspheres are trapped in the tumor's vascular bed, where they destroy the tumor by reducing its blood supply (embolic effect) and through local radiation damage to the cancer cells' DNA. Inclusion criteria for SIRT are unresectable liver-dominant or liver-only tumors, a life expectancy of more than 12 weeks and an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2. Exclusion criteria are clinical signs of liver failure (ascites, bilirubin >2.0 mg/ dL in absence of a reversible cause, serum albumin < 3.0 g/dL), a pretreatment scan showing >30 Gy exposure to the lungs or non-correctable shunting to the GI tract. Side effects are fatique, fever, nausea, abdominal pain. Potential complications are radiation gastritis, duodenitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis and radiation induced liver disease. SIRT is used in liver-only or liver-dominant disease in combination with systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) at 1<sup>st</sup>-line, 2nd-line or later. As monotherapy for mCRC and other metastatic disease and cholangiocarcinoma SIRT is used as salvage therapy in chemo-refractory patients. In hepatocellular carcinoma SIRT may potentially down-stage to reach respectability. In metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, irrespective of primary site, whether functional or non-functional, SIRT is used as first-or second-line therapy or in treatment-refractory disease. In these patients due to the much longer life expectancy re-treatment and fractionated SIRT appears possible, and may further extend disease control. Studies suggest earlier use may provide greater benefits. Conclusion(s): SIRT is a well tolerated therapy option for patients with malignant liver tumors not suitable for curative local interventions like surgery or ablation.",Excluded
1667,"Nitric oxide transiently converts synaptic inhibition to excitation in retinal amacrine cells. Nitric oxide (NO) is generated by multiple cell types in the vertebrate retina, including amacrine cells. We investigate the role of NO in the modulation of synaptic function using a culture system containing identified retinal amacrine cells. We find that moderate concentrations of NO alter GABA(A) receptor function to produce an enhancement of the GABA-gated current. Higher concentrations of NO also enhance GABA-gated currents, but this enhancement is primarily due to a substantial positive shift in the reversal potential of the current. Several pieces of evidence, including a similar effect on glycine-gated currents, indicate that the positive shift is due to an increase in cytosolic Cl-. This change in the chloride distribution is especially significant because it can invert the sign of GABA- and glycine-gated voltage responses. Furthermore, current- and voltage-clamp recordings from synaptic pairs of GABAergic amacrine cells demonstrate that NO transiently converts signaling at GABAergic synapses from inhibition to excitation. Persistence of the NO-induced shift in E(Cl-) in the absence of extracellular Cl- indicates that the increase in cytosolic Cl- is due to release of Cl- from an internal store. An NO-dependent release of Cl- from an internal store is also demonstrated for rat hippocampal neurons indicating that this mechanism is not restricted to the avian retina. Thus signaling in the CNS can be fundamentally altered by an NO-dependent mobilization of an internal Cl- store.",Excluded
1668,"Hippocampal sparing radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients: a planning study using volumetric modulated arc therapy. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to reduce exposure of the contralateral hippocampus in radiotherapy for glioblastoma using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).METHODS: Datasets of 27 patients who had received 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for glioblastoma with a prescribed dose of 60Gy in fractions of 2Gy were included in this planning study. VMAT plans were optimized with the aim to reduce the dose to the contralateral hippocampus as much as possible without compromising other parameters. Hippocampal dose and treatment parameters were compared to the 3D-CRT plans using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The influence of tumour location and PTV size on the hippocampal dose was investigated with the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.RESULTS: The median reduction of the contralateral hippocampus generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) with VMAT was 36 % compared to the original 3D-CRT plans (p < 0.05). Other dose parameters were maintained or improved. The median V30Gy brain could be reduced by 17.9 % (p < 0.05). For VMAT, a parietal and a non-temporal tumour localisation as well as a larger PTV size were predictors for a higher hippocampal dose (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Using VMAT, a substantial reduction of the radiotherapy dose to the contralateral hippocampus for patients with glioblastoma is feasible without compromising other treatment parameters. For larger PTV sizes, less sparing can be achieved. Whether this approach is able to preserve the neurocognitive status without compromising the oncological outcome needs to be investigated in the setting of prospective clinical trials.",Excluded
1669,"N-desmethylclozapine an M1 receptor agonist enhances nitric oxide's cardiac vagal facilitation in the isolated innervated rat right atrium. We have previously determined that neuronal nitric oxide (NO) may partly mediate its established cholinergic effect via activation of muscarinic type 1 (M1) receptors located at the preganglionic/postganglionic synapse. In this series of experiments we set out to confirm this finding using an M1 agonist. Experiments were carried out on the isolated vagally innervated right atrium in the presence of atenolol (4 microM). The right vagus was stimulated at 4, 8, 16, 32 Hz; pulse duration 1 ms at 20 V for 20 s and the effect on cardiac interval (ms) assessed. N-desmethylclozapine (100 nM), a potent M1 agonist, enhanced the vagally induced increase in cardiac interval, a lower concentration of 50 nM had no significant effect on cardiac interval. This effect was prevented by pre-treatment of the atria with the neuronal NO synthase inhibitor 1 (2-trifluoromethylphenyl)imidazole (TRIM) at 0.14 mM. The vagal stimulation protocol was repeated in order to rule out a reduction in vagal effectiveness which may have been due to the experimental stimulation protocol used in this study. TRIM (0.14 mM) alone causes a small but significant attenuation of the vagally induced increase in cardiac interval. These results show that agonism of M1 receptors on cardiac vagal preganglionic fibres enhances vagal cardiac effects which can be prevented by a neuronal NO inhibitor.",Excluded
1670,"Ratiometric calcium concentration estimation using LED excitation during mechanotransduction in single sensory neurons. In a previous study using Oregon Green BAPTA-1 fluorescence we found that intracellular calcium concentration in spider mechanoreceptor neurons rose during mechanical stimulation. We also showed that calcium elevation required the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels by action potentials, and could not be produced by the receptor potential alone. While evidence for mechanisms of calcium elevation in these neurons was clear, our estimates of actual calcium concentration depended on properties of the fluorescent dye in the neuron cytoplasm that could not be verified. We have now developed a method for ratiometric estimation of calcium concentration in these neurons using Fura Red dye, excitation by two light emitting diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths, and an avalanche photodiode fluorescence detector. The method is simple and economical to implement, allows concentration changes to be measured in the millisecond time range, and could easily be applied to a wide range of preparations.

We diagnosed her condition as radiation neuropathy based on the absence of a mass lesion in the right supraclavicular region, no RI deposits in that region on Ga and bone scintigraphy, findings supportive of a lesion in the right brachial plexus on EMG and the history of radiation therapy for supraclavicular lymph node metastasis of breast cancer 7 years previously. We treated the patient with pulse therapy with high-dose oral prednisolone. Subsequently, the muscle weakness and atrophy of the right forearm and fingers have improved gradually. We suggest that pulse therapy with high-dose oral prednisolone for radiation neuropathy should be evaluated in a clinical trial, since few therapies are available for this condition.",Excluded

1673,"Response to electric shock in rats: effects of selective midbrain raphe lesions. The forebrain serotonin (5-HT) concentrations of rats with lesions in the median (M; n equal to 5), dorsal (D; n equal to 5), and both (DM; n equal to 6) midbrain raphe nuclei were, respectively, 22, 48, and 70% lower than in control animals (n equal to 10). The lesion and control groups, however, did not evidence differences in pain sensitivity as measured by the flinch-jump technique. On the other hand, of the animals tested, those with M (n equal to 3) and DM (n equal to 4) lesions required more trials than controls (n equal to 6) to acquire a one-way avoidance response. D lesion rats (n equal to 2) did not differ from controls in one-way avoidance learning, except in terms of prolonged escape latencies during the first three trials. The previously reported increased sensitivity to painful stimuli subsequent to medial forebrain bundle lesions or para-chlorophenylalanine administration, therefore, does not appear to be due exclusively to disruption of ascending 5-HT fibers originating in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei. The effects of midbrain raphe lesions of avoidance learning, furthermore, depend on lesion locus, and are not due to either hypo- or hyperalgesia.",Excluded
1674,"Early skin and lung reactions in breast cancer patients after radiotherapy: prospective study. PURPOSE: The association between early radiological lung reactions consequent upon radiotherapy and patients' symptoms is not well established. This prospective study examined the association between symptoms experienced by the patient, clinical findings observed by the physician and reactions visible in chest X-ray as interpreted by a radiologist, as well as the association between skin or breast symptoms and lung symptoms induced by radiotherapy after different methods of surgery.METHODS: Altogether 207 consecutive breast cancer patients entered the trial between 1st October 1997 and 31st December 1998. Chest X-rays were taken at entry and 3, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. The frequency and intensity of symptoms as well as clinical and chest X-ray findings were assessed over time.RESULTS: Skin and breast symptoms were common after radiotherapy but seldom severe (9%). Lung reactions were seen in chest X-ray in 47% of patients in re-evaluation by a radiologist at 3 months. The frequency of lung or skin symptoms did not correlate with chest X-ray findings, but there was a significant correlation between skin and lung symptoms. Radiotherapy after conservative surgery for node-positive breast cancer caused lung reactions seen in chest X-ray more often than after mastectomy when using other techniques. The reactions were most common at the 6 month evaluation (P=0.01). Concomitant adjuvant chemo- or endocrine therapy did not significantly increase the incidence of lung reactions.CONCLUSIONS: Skin, breast and lung symptoms were frequent after radiotherapy, but there was no real association between lung or skin symptoms and chest X-ray findings. The only correlation noted was between skin or breast symptoms and lung symptoms experienced by patients. Radiotherapy after conservative surgery was more frequently linked to chest X-ray findings than radiotherapy after mastectomy. We conclude that routine chest X-ray after radiotherapy gives no more clinically relevant information than the symptoms of the patient and we do not recommend routine chest X-rays for that reason.",Excluded
1675,"Antioxidant activity stimulated by ultraviolet radiation in the nervous system of a crustacean. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can produce biological damage, principally oxidative stress, by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study evaluated biochemical impairments related to the oxidative stress induced by UVA, UVB and UVA. +. UVB (solar simulator-SIM) in environmental doses, during five consecutive days of exposure, in the brain and eyestalk of the crab Ucides cordatus. We evaluated these regions by sampling on the 1st, 3rd and 5th days of UV exposure for lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidant capacity against the peroxyl radical (ACAP), and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione-. S-transferase (GST). Immunohistochemical and immunoblotting assays were performed for anti-activated-caspase 3 in the brains. After the first day of exposure, LPO increased in the eyestalks and brains of the UV-exposed animals; ACAP, and CAT, GPX and GST activities also increased in the brains. On the third day, the LPO values in the eyestalk remained high in the UV-exposed groups, while ACAP decreased in the brain and eyestalk and CAT activity remained high in all irradiated groups in both regions. On the fifth day, LPO decreased in the eyestalk and brain of the UV-exposed groups. These results may have been a consequence of the antioxidant defense system (ADS) activity, since CAT activity was high in both regions, ACAP was high in the eyestalks of the SIM group, and GPX activity remained high in the eyestalks of the UVA and UVB groups. Immunohistochemical assays and immunoblotting showed that there was apoptosis in the brains of the UV-exposed crabs. In conclusion, environmental doses of UV can cause oxidative damage to the CNS cells, including apoptosis. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

1677,"Localization of neuropeptide Y receptor Y5 mRNA in the guinea pig brain by in situ hybridization. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has prominent stimulatory effects on food intake in virtually all animals that have been studied. In mammals, the effect is primarily mediated by receptors Y1 and Y5, which seem to contribute to different aspects of feeding behavior in guinea pigs and rats/mice. Interestingly, differences in receptor distribution among mammalian species have been reported. To get a broader perspective on the role of Y5, we describe here studies of guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), a species which due to its phylogenetic position in the mammalian radiation is an interesting complement to previous studies in rat and mouse. Guinea pig brain sections were hybridized with two <sup>35</sup>S-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to Y5 mRNA. The highest expression levels of Y5 mRNA were observed in the hippocampus and several hypothalamic and brain stem nuclei implicated in the regulation of feeding, such as the paraventricular, arcuate and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei. This contrasts with autoradiography studies that detected low Y5-like binding in these areas, a discrepancy observed also in rat and human. Y5 mRNA expression was also seen in the striatum, in great contrast to mouse and rat. Taken together, these data show that Y5 mRNA distribution displays some interesting species differences, but that its expression in feeding centers seems to be essentially conserved among mammals, adding further support for an important role in food intake. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction: Treatment options for relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) post-chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T) are limited. Here, we report the successful treatment of R/R DLBCL with programmed cell death 1 (PD1) inhibition post-allogeneic CAR-T. Case Report: A previously healthy 26-year-old Caucasian man developed B-symptoms and cervical lymphadenopathy. Biopsy revealed DLBCL, activated B-cell subtype, double expressor and Ki-67 >80%. PET/CT scan revealed disease above and below the diaphragm. He achieved a partial response (PR) after R-CHOP, progressive disease (PD) after R-ICE, stable disease (SD) after R-ESHAP, and PD one month after autologous CD19-targeted CAR-T with CTL019 (CD3zeta/4-1BB). He then received R-lenalidomide (len) with radiation (24 Gy) to his mediastinal mass achieving a PR, followed by a myeloablative (Cy/TBI-12 Gy) allogeneic stem cell transplant (aSCT) from his 10/10 HLAmatched brother. He achieved 100% donor chimerism 30 days post-aSCT (D+30). Despite persistent full donor chimerism, D+60 PET/CT showed PD with confirmed relapse upon biopsy. Immunosuppression was discontinued, and ibrutinib with len was started, followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) which led to a mixed response. He then continued on ibrutinib with weekly temsirolimus and received a second DLI achieving a PR, with PD shortly thereafter. He next proceeded to allogeneic CAR-T with axicabtagene-ciloleucel (CD3zeta/CD28), complicated by grade 1 cytokine release syndrome without neurotoxicity. Three weeks post-CAR-T, he developed diplopia due to a cranial nerve palsy. Brain MRI showed new pontine T2 changes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for lymphoma and infection, but notable for T-cell predominance. One month postCAR-T, PET/CT showed a complete metabolic response (CMR). Repeat brain MRI was unchanged. Two months later, he developed dizziness and intractable nausea, and repeat brain MRI showed a new lesion in the inferior cerebellar vermis, with resolution of previous pontine change. Evaluation of the CSF and peripheral blood revealed no CAR T-cell persistence, and PET/CT confirmed disease relapse in the cerebellum and mediastinum. Patient then received focal radiation (24 Gy) to his cerebellar lesion along with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, after which his neurologic symptoms resolved. MRI one day after radiation showed near-complete resolution of enhancing vermis lesion. After 3 cycles of pembrolizumab, PET/CT showed a CMR, with no active disease on brain MRI. Three months into PD1-inhibition therapy, his disease remains in CMR, without GVHD nor treatment-related toxicities. Conclusion(s): This case illustrates the efficacy of allogeneic CAR-T after failure of autologous CAR-T and aSCT. Furthermore, PD1 inhibition can be used safely after allogeneic CAR-T, underscoring the need for prospective clinical studies. Copyright © 2018",Excluded
1681,"Rapid separation and quantitation of combined neutral and polar lipid classes by high-performance liquid chromatography and evaporative light-scattering mass detection. Modifications are described for an innovative and widely used high-performance liquid chromatography technique that resolves a very broad spectrum of lipids for quantitation by evaporative light-scattering detection. Substitution of acetone for 2-propanol in a portion of the solvent gradient program yields consistent resolution of diacylglycerol and cholesterol without sacrificing baseline resolution of the remaining major lipid classes. Moreover, previously noted instabilities in triacylglycerol retention time are eliminated. The introduction of acetone also enables a 20% reduction in flow-rate without an increase in total run time. As a further modification of the mobile phase composition, acetic acid and ethanolamine are substituted for the serine-ethylamine combination that was originally shown to improve column performance. The combination of acetic acid and ethanolamine yields the same result but the increased volatility of these solutes over serine results in decreased baseline noise. Finally, 1,2-hexadecanediol is introduced as an internal standard that is well suited for this method. The chromatographic performance obtained with these modifications is demonstrated in compositional analyses of lipid extracts from rat liver, heart, kidney and brain.",Excluded
1682,"Quality of life after palliative treatment for oesophageal carcinoma - A prospective comparison between stent placement and single dose brachytherapy. Metal stent placement and single dose brachytherapy are commonly used treatment modalities for the palliation of inoperable oesophageal carcinoma. We investigated generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after these palliative treatments. Patients with dysphagia from inoperable oesophageal carcinoma were randomised to placement of a covered Ultraflex stent (n=108) or single dose (12 Gy) brachytherapy (n=101). We obtained longitudinal data on disease-specific (dysphagia score, European Organisation for Reasearch and Treament of Cancer (EORTC) OES-23, visual analogue pain scale) and generic (EORTC Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnarie (QLQ-C30), Euroqol (EQ)-5D) HRQoL at monthly home visits by a specially-trained research nurse. We compared HRQoL between the two treatments and analysed changes in HRQoL during follow-up. Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy, but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy. For generic HRQoL, there was an overall significant difference in favour of brachytherapy on four out of five functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (role, emotional, cognitive and social) (P<0.05). Generic HRQoL deteriorated over time on all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and EQ-5D, in particular physical and role functioning (on average -23 and -24 on a 100 points scale during 0.5 years of follow-up). This decline was more pronounced in the stent group. Major improvements were seen on the dysphagia and eating scales of the EORTC OES-23, in contrast to other scales of this disease-specific measure, which remained almost stable during follow-up. Reported levels of chest or abdominal pain remained stable during follow-up in both treatment groups, general pain levels increased to a minor extent. The effects of single dose brachytherapy on HRQoL compared favourably to those of stent placement for the palliation of oesophageal cancer. Future studies on palliative care for oesophageal cancer should at least include generic HRQoL scales, since these were more responsive in measuring patients' functioning and well-being during follow-up than disease-specific HRQoL scales. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

1683,"Qualitative assessment of intra-arterial cone beam CT angiography in precise anatomic localisation and treatment planning of intracranial and spinal arteriovenous fistulas. Background and Purpose Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is considered the standard for characterisation of intracranial/spinal arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Although DSA offers superior spatial and temporal resolution, it is limited by 2D planar imaging. We directly paralleled DSA and intra-arterial cone-beam CT angiography (IACBCTA) modalities to assess the relative IACBCTA efficacy in the anatomical identification/localisation of AVFs and utility for surgical/endovascular treatment planning. Materials and Methods Patients with intracranial/spinal AVFs underwent biplane DSA and IACBCTA procedures (AXIOMArtis FlatDetector Biplane-Angiosuite, Siemens) at two institutions with identical contrast injection, radiation exposure, and postprocessing techniques. Images were reviewed retrospectively and independently by two neurointerventionalists on a de-identified PACS workstation. Observers were blinded to clinical information and reviewed both DSA and IACBCTA images in tandem, obtained from the same IA injection. Qualitative image analysis was performed based on the level of delineation on a scale of 1-3 (3: Excellent/Good with minimal attenuation; 2: Moderate, relevant visibility with restrictions; 1: Poor, nondiagnostic). The following parameters were scored: a) Arterial feeders, b) Venous drainers and course, c) Fistula site, d) Adjacent anatomical landmarks for cross-sectional localisation, and e) Overall diagnostic value for interpretation. Differences between the scores were defined as the IACBCTA efficacy value. For evaluation of IACBTA treatment planning efficacy, observers described the treatment strategy at the end of DSA and IACBCTA grading respectively and scored its adjunctive value: altered or more confident treatment plan versus no value. Wilcoxon signed rank test compared scores of image quality parameters. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Kendall W coefficient of concordance. Results Thirty-two consecutive patients [22M/10F, mean age 60.9 +/- 12.4 years (29-83 years)] were studied. Intracranial AVFs were classified as Cognard type I (n=3), type II (n=11), type III (n=3), type IV (n=1) and metameric dural/pial (n=5). Spinal AVFs were limited to Anson-Spetzler type I (n=9). Interobserver agreement of overall diagnostic value for IACBCTA was good (K = 0.59, P=0.001) while it was fair for IACBCTA overall efficacy value (K = 0.32, P=0.046); however, no significant difference was observed between two observers' IACBCTA efficacy values (P=0.3). Both observers assigned significantly higher scores to IACBCTA for overall diagnostic value (both observers: P<0.0001). No significant differences were observed between DSA and IACBCTA scores while evaluating arterial feeders (observer 1: P=1.0, observer 2: P=0.5) or venous drainers (observer 1: P=0.08, observer 2: P=0.1). Both readers assigned significantly higher scores to IACBCTA when evaluating the fistula site (observer 1: P <0.0001, observer 2: P=0.0003) and adjacent anatomic landmarks/cross-sectional localisation (both observers: P<0.0001). In 30/32 cases, both observers noted that IACBCTA did not alter the treatment plan; but provided a more confident endovascular or surgical treatment approach. Both observers altered their treatment plan from an endovascular approach to microsurgery in one case based on IACBCTA. Conclusion IACBCTA adjunctively improves the anatomical delineation of AVFs, particularly in terms of fistula site and localisation; biplane DSA may be equally sensitive for arterial feeder and venous drainer identification. IACBCTA confers a more confident endovascular or surgical approach when performed in conjunction with DSA.",Excluded
1684,"Induction of c-fos and junB mRNA following in vivo brain irradiation. Although radiotherapy is a front line treatment for brain tumors, little is known about the in vivo molecular responses of brain to irradiation. In this study, expression of c-fos, c-jun and junB immediate-early genes were followed in mouse brain after irradiation. C-fos and junB, but not c-jun, mRNA was induced within 15 min in unanesthetized irradiated mice. Induction was transient and lasted < 4 h. The response was dose-dependent with increases in c-fos and junB mRNA levels after dose of > or = 2 and 7 Gy, respectively. Anesthesia of mice with pentobarbitol delayed the increases in mRNA expression and the response was attenuated. Pre-treatment of mice with dexamethasone, in a schedule which suppressed acute-phase gene expression after brain irradiation, did not significantly change c-fos and junB induction. Our results show that c-fos and junB responses occur in the brain in response to irradiation and that they can be modified by pentobarbital treatment but suggest that there is no direct correlation between the level of mRNA expression and later expression of cytokines or other acute-phase response genes.",Included
1685,"Boron Neutron Capture Therapy in the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme: The First Experiences in the Czech Republic. [Slovak]. Background. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, its treatment remains unsatisfactory with very limited overall survival. In the year 2001, in cooperation with Department of Neurosurgery, Nemocnice Na Homolce and Nuclear Research Institute in Rez, we have started to treat glioblastoma patients with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Methods and Results. Cells of malignant brain tumors, especially that of glioblastomas, are able to accumulate boron compounds. If BNCT should be successful, it is necessary to reach selective accumulation of sufficient amount of 10B in the tumor and low accumulation in the normal brain tissue. After BSH administration, radiation with low energy thermal neutrons is delivered. It results in nuclear capture and fission reactions with subsequent selective damage of tumor cells. At the time of analysis 9 patients have been enrolled. Therapy was completed in 5 patients. Treatment has been very well tolerated. We observed minimal acute toxicity associated with radiation and no laboratory abnormalities after administrations of BSH. Unfortunately treatment results were quite unsatisfactory. The median time to progression and overall survival were shorter then expected with conventional treatment. Conclusions. BNCT is very well tolerated with only a modest toxicity. In contrast to standard radiation, BNCT patients receive only one dose of radiation. Nevertheless, in this small pilot study first results were inferior when compared either to outcomes of conventional therapy or to results reported from other BNCT groups. It might be explained that lower dose of radiation had been used. Further study will show whether the higher dose radiation can improve treatment results.",Excluded
1686,"Intracranial hyperthermia through local photothermal heating with a fiberoptic microneedle device. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The fiberoptic microneedle device (FMD) seeks to leverage advantages of both laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to increase volumetric dispersal of locally infused chemotherapeutics through sub-lethal photothermal heat generation. This study focused on determination of photothermal damage thresholds with 1,064 nm light delivered through the FMD into in vivo rat models.MATERIALS AND METHODS: FMDs capable of co-delivering laser energy and fluid agents were fabricated through a novel off-center splicing technique involving fusion of a multimode fiberoptic to light-guiding capillary tubing. FMDs were positioned at a depth of 2.5 mm within the cerebrum of male rats with fluoroptic temperature probes placed within 1 mm of the FMD tip. Irradiation (without fluid infusion) was conducted at laser powers of 0 (sham), 100, 200, 500, or 750 mW. Evans blue-serum albumin conjugated complex solution (EBA) and laser energy co-delivery were performed in a second set of preliminary experiments.RESULTS: Maximum, steady-state temperatures of 38.7 +/- 1.6 and 42.0 +/- 0.9 degreeC were measured for the 100 and 200 mW experimental groups, respectively. Histological investigation demonstrated needle insertion damage alone for sham and 100 mW irradiations. Photothermal damage was detected at 200 mW, although observable thermal damage was limited to a small penumbra of cerebral cortical microcavitation and necrosis that immediately surrounded the region of FMD insertion. Co-delivery of EBA and laser energy presented increased volumetric dispersal relative to infusion-only controls.CONCLUSION: Fluoroptic temperature sensing and histopathological assessments demonstrated that a laser power of 100 mW results in sub-lethal brain hyperthermia, and the optimum, sub-lethal target energy range is likely 100-200 mW. The preliminary FMD-CED experiments confirmed the feasibility of augmenting fluid dispersal using slight photothermal heat generation, demonstrating the FMD's potential as a way to increase the efficacy of CED in treating MG.",Excluded
1687,"Pharmacokinetics of the potent hallucinogen, salvinorin A in primates parallels the rapid onset and short duration of effects in humans. Salvia divinorum, a mint plant originally used by the Mazatecs of Oaxaca, Mexico in spiritual rituals has gained popularity, in smoked form, as a legal hallucinogen in the United States and Europe. Abuse results in rapid onset and short-lasting effects that include visual hallucinations and motor-function impairment. Salvinorin A, the psychoactive component of S. divinorum, is a uniquely potent agonist at kappa-opioid receptors, targets for new therapeutic drugs. We labeled salvinorin A with C-11 by acylation of salvinorin B with [11C]-acetyl chloride to study whether its kinetic behavior in the brain parallels its uniquely fast, yet brief physiological effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies performed in 6 adult female baboons indicated extremely rapid brain uptake reaching a peak accounting for 3.3% of the total administered dose in 40 s and clearing with a half-life of 8 min. [11C]-salvinorin A was distributed throughout the brain with the highest concentration in the cerebellum and a notable concentration in the visual cortex, perhaps accounting for its physiological effects when smoked. Naloxone administration did not reduce the overall concentration of [11C]-salvinorin A significantly nor did it change its regional distribution. Peripheral organ kinetics suggested at least two modes of metabolism and excretion occur: through the renal and biliary systems. Our findings have revealed that the exceptionally rapid uptake and brief duration of salvinorin A in the brain match the time-course of visual hallucinations for S. divinorum when smoked. The effects of salvinorin A may occur at <10 mug in the human brain, emphasizing its remarkable potency.",Excluded

Radiotherapeutic treatment consists of targeted application of radiation beams to a tumor but exposure of surrounding healthy tissue is inevitable. In the brain, ionizing radiation induces breakdown of the blood-brain barrier by effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. Damage from directly irradiated cells can be transferred to surrounding non-exposed bystander cells, known as the radiation-induced bystander effect. We investigated involvement of connexin channels and paracrine signaling in radiation-induced bystander DNA damage in brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to focused X-rays. Irradiation caused DNA damage in the directly exposed area, which propagated over several millimeters in the bystander area. DNA damage was significantly reduced by the connexin channel-targeting peptide Gap26 and the Cx43 hemichannel blocker TAT-Gap19. ATP release, dye uptake, and patch clamp experiments showed that hemichannels opened within 5 min post irradiation in both irradiated and bystander areas. Bystander signaling involved cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and IP<inf>3</inf>, ATP, ROS, and NO signaling, with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, IP<inf>3</inf>, and ROS as crucial propagators of DNA damage.

1690,"Distinct functional domains of Nbs1 modulate the timing and magnitude of ATM activation after low doses of ionizing radiation. The ATM kinase is a tumour suppressor and a key activator of genome integrity checkpoints in mammalian cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) and other insults that elicit DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In response to IR, autophosphorylation on serine 1981 causes dissociation of ATM dimers and initiates cellular ATM kinase activity. Here, we show that the kinetics and magnitude of ATM Ser1981 phosphorylation after exposure of human fibroblasts to low doses (2 Gy) of IR are altered in cells deficient in Nbs1, a substrate of ATM and a component of the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex involved in processing/repair of DSBs and ATM-dependent cell cycle checkpoints. Timely phosphorylation of both ATM Ser1981 and the ATM substrate Smc1 after IR were rescued via retrovirally mediated reconstitution of Nbs1-deficient cells by wild-type Nbs1 or mutants of Nbs1 defective in the FHA domain or nonphosphorylatable by ATM, but not by Nbs1 lacking the Mre11-interaction domain. Our data indicate that apart from its role downstream of ATM in the DNA damage checkpoint network, the MRN complex serves also as a modulator/amplifier of ATM activity. Although not absolutely required for ATM activation, the MRN nuclease complex may help reach the threshold activity of ATM necessary for optimal genome maintenance and prevention of cancer.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To develop and investigate a set of biophysical models based on a mechanically coupled reaction-diffusion model of the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor growth after radiation therapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Post-radiation therapy response is modeled using a cell death model (M<sub>d</sub>), a reduced proliferation rate model (M<sub>p</sub>), and cell death and reduced proliferation model (M<sub>dp</sub>). To evaluate each model, rats (n = 12) with C6 gliomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced MRI at 7 time points over 2 weeks. Rats received either 20 or 40 Gy between the third and fourth imaging time point. Diffusion-weighted MRI was used to estimate tumor cell number within enhancing regions in contrast-enhanced MRI data. Each model was fit to the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor cell number from time point 1 to time point 5 to estimate model parameters. The estimated model parameters were then used to predict tumor growth at the final 2 imaging time points. The model prediction was evaluated by calculating the error in tumor volume estimates, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number.RESULTS: For both the rats treated with either 20 or 40 Gy, significantly lower error in tumor volume, average surface distance, and voxel-based cell number was observed for the M<sub>dp</sub> and M<sub>p</sub> models compared with the M<sub>d</sub> model. The M<sub>dp</sub> model fit, however, had significantly lower sum squared error compared with the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>d</sub> models.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that for both doses, the M<sub>p</sub> and M<sub>dp</sub> models result in accurate predictions of tumor growth, whereas the M<sub>d</sub> model poorly describes response to radiation therapy.",Excluded
1692,"Isolated Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the infundibulum presenting with fulminant diabetes insipidus. Introduction: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (histiocytosis X) is a rare disorder that can manifest with solitary bony lesions or disseminated disease in various tissues. A common manifestation of the disease is diabetes insipidus even in the absence of neural involvement. Disseminated disease often involves the central nervous system, but only six isolated lesions in the infundibulum have been reported. Case report: An 18-year-old male had failed to develop secondary sexual characteristics. He also had diabetes insipidus for more than 1 year. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a 1-cm homogeneously enhancing mass in the region of the infundibulum. No other lesions were found in other organ systems. The patient underwent an orbitozygomatic osteotomy and pterional craniotomy. The lesion, which was adherent to the infundibulum, was partially resected. Microscopic analysis showed multiple lymphocytes and eosinophils with Langerhans cells that stained positive for S-100. Langerhans cell histiocytosis was diagnosed, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6 with no neurological deficits. His diabetes insipidus persisted, and he underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy to the sellar region. Conclusion(s): Isolated Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the infundibulum is rare. The usual presentation is hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and diabetes insipidus. Patients with diabetes insipidus of unknown origin should undergo MRI of the sellar region to rule out infundibular abnormalities. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",Excluded
1693,"""Critical periods"" in vestibular development or adaptation of gravity sensory systems to altered gravitational conditions?. 1. A feature of sensory, neuronal and motor systems is the existence of a critical period during their development. Modification of environmental conditions during this specific period of life affects development in a long-term manner, or even irreversibly. Deprivation is the prefered approach to study the existence and duration of critical periods. For gravity sensory systems, space flights offer the only opportunity for deprivation conditions. 2. Studies in a fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) and an amphibian (Xenopus laevis) revealed a significant sensitivity of their roll-induced static vestibuloocular reflex (rVOR) to a 9- to 10-day gravity deprivation (microgravity) during a spaceflight. In some instances, the rVOR was augmented after the flight as demonstrated in young Oreochromis which were launched when their rVOR had not been developed, and in Xenopus tadpoles launched after their rVOR had developed. Fish which could perform the rVOR at launch were insensitive to microgravity exposure. A similar insensitivity to microgravity was observed in Xenopus tadpoles with normal body shape which had not yet developed their rVOR at launch. Some tadpoles, however, developed an upward bended tail during their space flight; their rVOR was significantly depressed after termination of microgravity independent of the age at onset of the flight. Hypergravity depressed the rVOR for all so far tested developmental stages in both Oreochromis and Xenopus. 3. Both adaptive processes during exposure to altered gravity as well as the existence of a critical period in vestibular development might be responsible for the modulation of the rVOR recorded after exposure to altered gravity. Deprivation studies have to be extended to older developmental stages to test the possibility of a critical period; however, this approach is limited due to the low number of space flights.

The sensitivity of LGN neurons, extrapolated to populations, was similar to the monkeys' at low temporal frequencies. At high temporal frequencies, LGN sensitivity exceeded the monkeys' and approached the upper bound set by cone photocurrents. These results confirm a loss of high-frequency information downstream of the LGN. However, this loss accounted for only about 5% of the total. Phototransduction accounted for essentially all of the rest. Together, these results show that low temporal frequency information is lost primarily between the cones and the LGN, whereas high-frequency information is lost primarily within the cones, with a small additional loss downstream of the LGN.",Excluded

1697,"Reevaluation of near-infrared light propagation in the adult human head: implications for functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Using both experimental and theoretical methods, we examine the contribution of different parts of the head to near-IR (NIR) signal. Time-resolved spectroscopy is employed to measure the mean optical path length (PL), and the absorption (mu(a)) and reduced scattering (mu(s)') coefficients in multiple positions of the human head. Monte Carlo simulations are performed on four-layered head models based on an individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to determine mu(a) and mu(s)' in each layer of the head by solving inverse problems, and to estimate the partial path length in the brain (p-PL) and the spatial sensitivity to regions in the brain at the source-detector separation of 30 mm. The PL is closely related to the thickness of the scalp, but not to that of other layers of the head. The p-PL is negatively related to the PL and its contribution ratio to the PL is 5 to 22% when the differential path length factor is 6. Most of the signal attributed to the brain comes from the upper 1 to 2 mm of the cortical surface. These results indicate that the NIR signal is very sensitive to hemodynamic changes associated with functional brain activation in the case that changes in the extracerebral tissue are ignorable.",Excluded

1699,"Quantitative analysis of calcium-dependent vesicle recruitment and its functional role at the calyx of Held synapse. Recruitment of release-ready vesicles at synapses is one of the important factors, which determine dynamic properties of signaling between neurons in the brain. It has been shown that the rate of vesicle recruitment is accelerated by strong synaptic activity. An elevated concentration of calcium ions in the presynaptic terminal ([Ca2+]i) has been proposed to be responsible for this effect. However, the precise relationship between [Ca2+]i and recruitment has not been established yet, and the functional consequences of accelerated recruitment during synaptic activity have not been quantified experimentally. To probe the intracellular Ca2+ dependence of vesicle recruitment and to examine its functional role during trains of action potential (AP)-like stimuli, we monitored [Ca2+]i and synaptic responses simultaneously with paired recordings at the calyx of Held synapse. We found that a distinct, rapidly releasing vesicle pool is replenished with a rate that increases linearly with [Ca2+]i, without any apparent cooperativity. The slope factor for this increase is approximately 1 pool/(microM x s). Blocking Ca2+-dependent recruitment specifically with a calmodulin binding peptide revealed that the steady-state EPSCs during 100 Hz AP-like trains were maintained through this Ca2+-dependent recruitment mechanism. Using a simple model of vesicle dynamics, we estimated that the recruitment rate accelerated 10-fold during the steady-state compared with the rate at resting [Ca2+]i. We could also demonstrate an approximate sixfold increase in release probability (facilitation) during the initial 5-15 AP-like stimuli of such trains in our experimental condition, regardless of EPSC depression.",Excluded
1700,"11C-methionine-PET for differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis: radiomics approach with random forest classifier. Differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis is often difficult. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of 11C-methionine (MET)-PET radiomics for distinguishing recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, as compared with conventional tumor-to-normal cortex (T/N) ratio evaluation. We enrolled 41 patients with metastatic brain tumor or glioma treated using radiation therapy who underwent MET-PET. The area with a standardized uptake value > 1.3 times that of the normal brain cortex was contoured. Forty-two PET features were extracted and used in a random forest classifier and the diagnostic performance was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Gini index was measured to identify relevant PET parameters for classification. The reference standard was surgical histopathological analysis or more than 6 months of follow-up with MRI. Forty-four lesions were used for the analysis. Thirty-three and 11 lesions were confirmed as recurrent brain tumor and radiation necrosis, respectively. Radiomics and T/N ratio evaluation showed sensitivities of 90.1% and 60.6%, and specificities of 93.9% and 72.7% with areas under the curve of 0.98 and 0.73, respectively. Gray level co-occurrence matrix dissimilarity was the most pertinent feature for diagnosis. MET-PET radiomics yielded excellent outcome for differentiating recurrent brain tumor from radiation necrosis, which outperformed T/N ratio evaluation.",Excluded
1701,"Effect of protons on the mechanical response of rat muscle nociceptive fibers and neurons in vitro. Strong exercise makes muscle acidic, and painful. The stimulus that activates muscle nociceptors in such instance may be protons. Reportedly, however, not many afferents are excited by protons alone. We, therefore, posited that protons sensitize muscular nociceptors to mechanical stimuli. We examined effects of protons on mechanical sensitivity of muscle nociceptors by single-fiber recording from rat muscle-nerve preparations in vitro and by whole cell patch-clamp recording of mechanically activated (MA) currents from cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. We recorded 38 Adelta- and C-fibers. Their response magnitude was increased by both pH 6.2 and pH 6.8; in addition the mechanical threshold was lowered by pH 6.2. Decrease in the threshold by pH6.2 was also observed in MA currents. Presently observed sensitization by protons could be involved in several types of ischemic muscle pain, and may also be involved in cardiovascular and respiratory controls during exercise.",Excluded

Tumor-induced CD45<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>+</sup>CD71<sup>+</sup> erythroid progenitor cells, termed ""Ter cells,"" promote tumor progression by secreting artemin (ARTN), a neurotrophic peptide that activates REarranged during Transfection (RET) signaling. We demonstrate that both local tumor ionizing radiation (IR) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) treatment decreased tumor-induced Ter cell abundance in the mouse spleen and ARTN secretion outside the irradiation field in an interferon- and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent manner. Recombinant erythropoietin promoted resistance to radiotherapy or anti-PD-L1 therapies by restoring Ter cell numbers and serum ARTN concentration. Blockade of ARTN or potential ARTN signaling partners, or depletion of Ter cells augmented the antitumor effects of both IR and anti-PD-L1 therapies in mice. Analysis of samples from patients who received radioimmunotherapy demonstrated that IR-mediated reduction of Ter cells, ARTN, and GFRalpha3, an ARTN signaling partner, were each associated with tumor regression. Patients with melanoma who received immunotherapy exhibited favorable outcomes associated with decreased expression of GFRalpha3. These findings demonstrate an out-of-field, or ""abscopal,"" effect mediated by adaptive immunity, which is induced during local tumor irradiation. This effect, in turn, governs the therapeutic effects of radiation and immunotherapy. Therefore, our results identify multiple targets to potentially improve outcomes after radiotherapy and immunotherapy.",Excluded
1703,"Mind over (white)matter: A relationship between client change talk and whitematter integrity?. Diusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a method of applying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the assessment of whitemattermicrostructure. DTI is used tomeasure the directional coherence of water molecules (fractional anisotropy: FA) in white matter fiber bundles in the brain. High FA generally indicates greater axonal diameter, axonal density, & myelination. Fiber bundles including the arcuate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, have been linked to language functions (Frederici & Giheran, in press). Given the theorized role of client language in motivational interviewing (Moyers et al., 2009), and the evidence for dierences in brain activity between types of client change language (Houck et al., in press), the goal of the present study was to examine the correlation between FA and measures of client language from MI treatment sessions for alcohol use. DTI was available from9 subjects (M age = 42.4, SD = 13.5 years). Although change talk counts are linked to treatment outcomes, in the present sample these counts were also correlated with age, which has a strong independent relationship with FA. Instead we evaluated a transition probability extracted from sequential coding of MI sessions: the log-transformed odds ratio for the transition between therapist open questions and client change talk (OQ2CT).With both age and OQ2CT in the model, we observed a trend in right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (p = .24) and anterior thalamic radiation (p = .196), as well as an eect in the left cerebellum (p = .05), each indicating a negative relationship between FA and the odds of responding to an open question with change talk. Work with alcohol dependent individuals shows decreased FA in superior cingulum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Pfeferbaum et al., 2009). More recent research comparing current and remitted AUD suggests that these abnormalities are linked to recent drinking (Monnig et al., 2012). It is unlikely that within-session client speech has an immediate and direct eect upon whitematter integrity. Given the negative correlation in these data, amore plausible explanation is that participants with more severe drinking, and concomitantly greater damage to whitematter, aremore likely to describe negative consequences when asked about their drinking. Research with a larger sample and follow-up assessment is necessary before stronger conclusions can be drawn.",Excluded

Following the Chernobyl accident, the most significant problem for the population of the former Soviet Union for the next 50-70 years will be chronic internal contamination by radionuclides. One of the few experiments carried out in this field reported that neurotransmitter metabolism in the central nervous system of the rat was disturbed after feeding with oats contaminated by <sup>137</sup>Cs for 1 month. The present study assessed the effect of chronic contamination by depleted U or <sup>137</sup>Cs on the metabolism of two neurotransmitters in cerebral areas of rats.

1705,"Interference between active implanted medical devices and electromagnetic field emitting devices is rare but real: Results of an incidence study in a population of physicians in France. Background and Objective Assessing the behavior of active implanted medical devices (AIMDs) in response to electromagnetic field (EMF) transmitters is a current issue of great importance. Given the numerous telecommunication systems and our lack of knowledge as to the impact of electromagnetic effects, this study investigated the reality of possible AIMD disturbance by EMFs by interviewing health professionals. Method A self-administered postal questionnaire was sent to almost 5,000 physicians in five specialties: cardiology; endocrinology; ears, nose, and throat; urology; and neurology. It collected data on the existence and annual number of incidents observed and the conditions under which they occurred, the EMF sources involved, and the means of managing the malfunctions. Results A total of 1,188 physicians agreed to participate. Sixteen percent of participants reported cases of implant failure, three-quarters of whom, mainly in cardiology, reported rates of at least one incident per year - amounting to more than 100 incidents per year in all. Severity appeared to be moderate (discomfort or transient symptoms), but frequently required resetting or, more rarely, replacing the device. Some serious incidents were, however, reported. The sources implicated were basically of two types: electronic security systems (antitheft and airport gates) and medical electromagnetic radiation devices. These incidents were poorly reported within the public health system, preventing follow-up and effective performance of alert and surveillance functions. Conclusion Although minor, the risk of interference between EMF sources and AIMDs is real and calls for vigilance. It particularly concerns antitheft and airport security gates, though other sources may also cause incidents. ©2013, The Authors. Journal compilation ©2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1706,"Cycling hypoxia increases U87 glioma cell radioresistance via ROS induced higher and long-term HIF-1 signal transduction activity. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors are the most common type of brain tumors and resistance to radiotherapy. This study aimed to investigate the differential effect and mechanism of tumor microenvironments, cycling hypoxia and non-interrupted hypoxia, on tumor cell radiosensitivity in the human U87 glioblastoma tumor model. We exposed U87 cells and mice bearing U87 glioma to experimentally imposed cycling or non-interrupted hypoxic stress in vitro and in vivo prior to treatment with ionizing irradiation. Clonogenic survival assay and tumor growth measurements were performed to determine tumor radiosensitivity. The differential regulation of non-interrupted vs. cycling hypoxia by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and the impact of HIF-1alpha on hypoxia-induced radioresistance were assessed by molecular assay and RNAi-knockdown technology. Our results demonstrated that cycling hypoxia induced higher and longer term HIF-1 signal transduction activity via reactive oxygen species (ROS) in U87 cells compared with non-interrupted hypoxia. Cycling hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha activation reflected ROS mediated HIF-1alpha synthesis and stabilization, whereas non-interrupted hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha activation was due to decreased HIF-1alpha degradation resulting from decreased prolyl hydroxylation. With regard to tumor radiosensitivity, cycling hypoxia induced more tumor cell radioresistance and a decreased response to radiotherapy in U87 cells compared with non-interrupted hypoxia. HIF-1 knockdown during in vitro and in vivo hypoxic stresses combined with radiotherapy suppressed cycling and non-interrupted hypoxia-induced radioresistance while increasing overall tumor radiosensitivity. Our results suggest that cycling hypoxia induces more radioresistance than non-interrupted hypoxia in U87 gliomas, and ROS mediated HIF-1alpha activation is a crucial mechanism involved in hypoxia-induced differential radioresistant in U87 gliomas.",Excluded

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is the leading cause of age-related dementia. Currently, therapeutic agent delivery to the CNS is a valued approach for AD therapy. Unfortunately, the CNS penetration is greatly hampered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Focused-ultrasound (FUS) has been demonstrated to temporally open the BBB, thus promoting therapeutic agent delivery to the CNS. Recently, the BBB opening procedure was further reported to clear the deposited Abeta plaque due to microglia activation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the use of FUS-induced BBB opening to enhance GSK-3 inhibitor delivery, which would bring additive effect of Abeta plaque clearance by FUS with the reduction of Abeta plaque synthesis by GSK-3 inhibitor in an AD mice model. FUS-induced BBB opening on APPswe/PSEN1-dE9 transgenic mice was performed unilaterally, with the contralateral hemisphere serving as a reference. GSK-3 level was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and autoradiography (ARG) was also conducted to quantitatively confirm the Abeta plaque reduction. Results from IHC showed GSK-3 inhibitor effectively reduced GSK-3 activity up to 61.3% with the addition of FUS-BBB opening and confirming the proposed therapeutic route. ARG also showed significant Abeta-plaque reduction up to 31.5%. This study reveals the therapeutic potentials of ultrasound to AD treatment, and may provide a useful strategy for neurodegenerative disease treatment.",Excluded
1709,"Red LED photobiomodulation reduces pain hypersensitivity and improves sensorimotor function following mild T10 hemicontusion spinal cord injury. BACKGROUND: The development of hypersensitivity following spinal cord injury can result in incurable persistent neuropathic pain. Our objective was to examine the effect of red light therapy on the development of hypersensitivity and sensorimotor function, as well as on microglia/macrophage subpopulations following spinal cord injury.METHODS: Wistar rats were treated (or sham treated) daily for 30 min with an LED red (670 nm) light source (35 mW/cm(2)), transcutaneously applied to the dorsal surface, following a mild T10 hemicontusion injury (or sham injury). The development of hypersensitivity was assessed and sensorimotor function established using locomotor recovery and electrophysiology of dorsal column pathways. Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL were performed to examine cellular changes in the spinal cord.RESULTS: We demonstrate that red light penetrates through the entire rat spinal cord and significantly reduces signs of hypersensitivity following a mild T10 hemicontusion spinal cord injury. This is accompanied with improved dorsal column pathway functional integrity and locomotor recovery. The functional improvements were preceded by a significant reduction of dying (TUNEL(+)) cells and activated microglia/macrophages (ED1(+)) in the spinal cord. The remaining activated microglia/macrophages were predominantly of the anti-inflammatory/wound-healing subpopulation (Arginase1(+)ED1(+)) which were expressed early, and up to sevenfold greater than that found in sham-treated animals.CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that a simple yet inexpensive treatment regime of red light reduces the development of hypersensitivity along with sensorimotor improvements following spinal cord injury and may therefore offer new hope for a currently treatment-resistant pain condition.",Excluded

1711,"Prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm for head and neck paragangliomas. Purpose/Objective(s): Paragangliomas of the head and neck represent a wide range of predominantly indolent tumors which may cause serious functional deficits if ignored yet its treatment may result in severe iatrogenic morbidity. Surgery and radiation therapy are both established modalities when treatment is warranted but how to integrate these two modalities to optimize tumor control, minimize iatrogenic morbidity and preserve organ function is not clearly established. To this end, a prospective multidisciplinary treatment algorithm was established at our center over the past decade. Patients were diagnosed by anatomic and functional imaging characteristics typically determined by CT/MRI and octreotide avidity. In general, patients who had a solitary carotid body tumor were offered surgery; while those involving the skull base were offered radiation therapy and those with multiple paragangliomas were offered either surgery for the smaller tumor and radiation for the remaining tumors or radiation for all tumors. Materials/Methods: From 1998-2011, 51 patients (42F:9M) were treated with definitive radiation therapy. Median age was 64 years (range, 19-92 year). Paraganglioma subsites were as follows: jugular 44% (n=24), tympanic 20% (n=11), vagal 15% (n=8), carotid body 13% (n=7), parasympathetic 2% (n=1). Two patients had bilateral tumors, while 2 patients had 3 synchronous tumors. The median radiation dose was 45 Gy (21-50.4 Gy) treated with 3D technique in 72% (n=39), IMRT in 20% (n=11) or SBRT 2% (n=1). During this time period, 38 patients underwent primary surgery of whom 6 received adjuvant radiation therapy. Result(s): At a median follow-up of 34 months (4-103 mos), one patient treated with radiation therapy failed at 37 months for a 3 year actuarial LC 100% and 5 year LC 94%. None of the 38 surgically treated failed. Patients who received radiation therapy experienced grade 1/2 complications including mucositis (13%) or xerostomia (23%), and two patients developed dizziness (5%). Of patients who underwent surgical excision, four patients had post-operative cranial nerve deficits, including vocal fold paresis, Horner's syndrome, hearing loss, and temporary facial nerve weakness. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this experience represents the first prospective algorithmic-based multidisciplinary approach with an emphasis on single modality treatment that demonstrates excellent tumor control, low rates of severe iatrogenic morbidity and long-term function preservation. While both surgery and radiation result in excellent tumor control, radiation therapy should be considered a primary treatment for skull-based paraganglioma for which it offers a high therapeutic ratio.",Excluded
1712,"Morphological changes in ICP pulse waveform as potential markers for early determination of external ventricular drain clamping trial outcome. Introduction External ventricular drains (EVD) are used to manage intracranial pressure (ICP) in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) patients. After days of use a decision is made to remove the drain or place a shunt, involving EVD clamping and CT imaging to observe ventricular size and clinical status. This practice leads to prolonged hospital stay and radiation exposure. This study applies a validated morphological clustering analysis of KCP pulse (MOCAIP) algorithm to differentiate an intact CSF system from an abnormal one during EVD clamping. We hypothesize that pulses with similar mean ICP should have similar shapes in an intact CSF system. Methods This is a retrospective study with 43 aSAH patients with reported clamping trial, admitted to our institution between 03/2013 and 08/2014. By reviewing clinical notes and pre/post brain imaging results, 25 patients were determined with an intact cSf system (A) and 18 with an impaired one (B). MOCAIP algorithm was applied to ICP signals to form series of artifact-free dominant pulses. Finally, pulses with similar mean ICP were identified and Euclidean and geodesic inter-pulse distances calculated in a 4-hour moving window. Results ANOVA analyses showed significant difference on the standard deviations of Euclidean (p< 0.001) and geodesic distance (p=0.001), between groups A and B. Mann-Whitney U tests were used on the mean distances, showing significant difference on the Euclidean (p=0.007) and geodesic distance (p=0.02) between the two groups. The area under the ROC curve was 0.79 and 0.78 for the standard deviations and 0.74 and 0.71 for the mean Euclidean and geodesic distance respectively. Conclusions Patients with an impaired CSF system showed a larger mean and variability of inter-pulse distances, indicating frequent changes on the morphology of pulses.. This technique may provide a method to rapidly determine if patients will need placement of a shunt or can simply have the EVD removed.",Excluded
1713,"Progressive and reproducible focal cortical ischemia with or without late spontaneous reperfusion generated by a ring-shaped, laser-driven photothrombotic lesion in rats. Clinical stroke is mostly of thromboembolic origin, in which the magnitude of brain damage resulting from arterial occlusions depends on the degree and duration of the concomitant ischemia. To facilitate more controllable and reproducible study of stroke-related pathophysiological mechanisms, a photothrombotic ring stroke model was initially developed in adult rats. The ring interior zone comprises an anatomically well confined cortical region-at-risk which is gradually encroached by progressive hypoperfusion, thus mimicking the situation (albeit in inverse fashion) of an ischemic penumbra or stroke-in-evolution. Modification of this model using a thinner ring irradiation beam resulted in late spontaneous reperfusion in the cortical region-at-risk and a remarkable morphological tissue recovery in this ostensibly critically injured region. On the other hand, doubling the thin irradiating beam intensity facilitates a complementary situation in which lack of reperfusion in the region-at-risk after stroke induction leads to tissue pannecrosis. The dual photothrombotic ring stroke model, effectuated either with or without reperfusion and thereby tissue recovery or pannecrosis, may be well suited for the study of events related to postischemic survival or cell death in the penumbra region. To popularize the photothrombotic ring stroke model, we present a detailed protocol of how this model is induced in either version as well as protocols for transcardial carbon black perfusion and laser-Doppler flowmetry experiments. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded

Introduction: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has been used to treat cavernous malformations (CMs) located in basal ganglia and thalamus. However, previous reports are limited by small patient population. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological data of 53 patients with CMs of basal ganglia and thalamus who underwent GKRS at West China Hospital between May 2009 and July 2018. All patients suffered at least once bleeding before GKRS. The mean volume of these lesions was 1.77 cm, and the mean marginal dose was 13.2 Gy. After treatment, patients were followed to determine the change in symptom and hemorrhage event. Result(s): The mean follow-up period was 52.1 months (6.2-104.3 months). The calculated annual hemorrhage rate (AHR) was 48.5% prior to GKRS and 3.0% after treatment (p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 2-, 3-, and 5-year hemorrhage-free survival were 88, 80.9, and 80.9%, respectively. Preexisting symptoms were resolved in 11 patients, improved in 14, and stable in 5. Only 2 patients (3.8%) developed new neurological deficit. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that AHR after GKRS was comparable to the recorded AHR of natural history (3.1-4.1%) in previous studies. GKRS is a safe and effective treatment modality for CMs of basal ganglia and thalamus. Considering the relative insufficient understanding of natural history of CMs, future study warrants longer follow-up. © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To compare the lateral mortise and anterior midline approaches to fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections with respect to successful intra-articular needle placement, fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, and dose area product (DAP).MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant. 498 fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections were performed or supervised by one of nine staff radiologists from 11/1/2010-12/31/2013. The injection approach was determined by operator preference. Images were reviewed on a PACS workstation to determine the injection approach (lateral mortise versus anterior midline) and to confirm intra-articular needle placement. Fluoroscopy time (minutes), radiation dose (mGy), and DAP (muGy-m(2)) were recorded and compared using the student's t-test (fluoroscopy time) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test (radiation dose and DAP).RESULTS: There were 246 lateral mortise injections and 252 anterior midline injections. Two lateral mortise injections were excluded from further analysis because no contrast was administered. Intra-articular location of the needle tip was documented in 242/244 lateral mortise injections and 252/252 anterior midline injections. Mean fluoroscopy time was shorter for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (0.7 +/- 0.5 min versus 1.2 +/- 0.8 min, P < 0.0001).

1716,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging as an evaluation of the response of brain metastases treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. Background: Loss of tumor cell results in a relative increase in extracellular space that may lead to alteration of ADC. Our purpose was to see if the ADC could be used, rather than methods depending on changes in tumor size, to predict treatment success after treatment of brain metastases with SRS. Method(s): In a prospective study, the ADCs of 21 patients with 32 solid or solid-dominated brain metastases were taken before and 1 week, 1 month, and at 3-month intervals after SRS. Mean ADC values at the various time intervals were compared with each other to see whether or not the ADC might be used as an early indicator of treatment success or failure. Result(s): The mean pretreatment value of the ADC in the metastatic tumors was 1.05 +/- 0.12 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s (mean +/- SD). This value for the tumors rose significantly (P = .009) 7 days after SRS and continued to rise with time. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that 91% of these tumors had been controlled by the SRS. The ADC values in cystic/necrotic tumor tissue (2.13 +/- 0.18 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) were significantly (P < .001) higher than those in noncentral necrotic tumor tissue (1.61 +/- 0.14 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s).

The brain tissue sections were performed by immunohistochemistry to demonstrate both expressions of NR2A, NR2B immune-activity in the hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG by using computer-assisted image analysis system.RESULTS: In NR2A: the expression of 0.5 mW/cm(2) power density group was significantly lower than 0 mW/cm(2) power density group in CA3 [(8.5 +/- 1.5) vs (11.1 +/- 1.8), P < 0.01] and had not been significantly changed in CA1 and DG. The expression of 1.0 mW/cm(2) power density group was significantly lower than 0 mW/cm(2) power density group in CA1 and CA3 [(7.9 +/- 1.6) vs (9.7 +/- 1.5); (8.4 +/- 1.7) vs (11.1 +/- 1.8), respective P < 0.05, P < 0.01] and had not been significantly changed in DG. In NR2B: the expression of 0.5 mW/cm(2) power density group was significantly lower than 0 mW/cm(2) power density group in CA1 and CA3 [(16.4 +/- 1.0) vs (17.8 +/- 1.6); (9.6 +/- 1.9) vs (11.2 +/- 2.1), respective P < 0.05]. The expression of 1.0 mW/cm(2) power density group was significantly lower than 0 mW/cm(2) power density group in CA1, CA3 and DG [(13.1 +/- 2.4) vs (17.8 +/- 1.6); (9.3 +/- 1.4) vs (11.2 +/- 2.1); (7.3 +/- 0.1) vs (8.5 +/- 1.0), respective P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.05].CONCLUSION: There were findings of the effects on NMDA receptor subunits in different hippocampus sections after exposure to 1800 MHz radiofrequency radiation.",Excluded
1719,"Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Case for Caution. Purpose: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has a well-recognized role in the treatment of leukemia and small-cell lung cancer. Clinical utility has yet to be determined for breast cancer, where an emerging group at high risk of brain metastasis has fuelled consideration of PCI. Methods and Materials: In reviewing our experience with PCI as part of a complex protocol for advanced breast cancer, we present descriptive data on late central nervous system outcomes in those receiving PCI. After high-dose anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy, Stage IIIB/IV breast cancer responders underwent tandem autologous marrow transplantation. Those in continued remission were referred for PCI. Whole-brain radiotherapy was delivered by usual means, at 36 Gy in 20 fractions. Result(s): Twenty-four women, with median age 45 (28-61), were enrolled between 1995 and 1998. Disease was largely metastatic (79%), and 75% were previously exposed to chemotherapy or hormonotherapy. Ten patients received PCI, at a median of 13.4 (11.8-16.5) months from study entry. Six patients developed brain metastases, 2 despite PCI. Striking functional decline was documented in 3 patients (at 9 months, 4 years, and 5 years post-PCI), including one previously high-functioning woman requiring full care for posttreatment dementia. Conclusion(s): We present a series of advanced breast cancer patients treated prophylactically with whole-brain radiotherapy following an aggressive chemotherapy regimen. Although the therapeutic benefit of PCI is not ascertainable here, we describe brain metastases occurring despite PCI and serious long-term neurobehavioral sequelae in PCI-treated patients. Any further investigation of PCI in high-risk breast cancer will need to be approached with caution. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1720,"Properties of paired-pulse firing thresholds and the relationship with paired-pulse plasticity in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. A large variability of paired-pulse plasticity (PPP) has been reported in CA3-CA1 synapses, and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) has long been extensively used as a relative index of release probability (P(r)) from the presynaptic terminal. One of the most common ways of studying P(r) and PPP is to pass paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) through an electrode to fire an action potential (AP), which in turn opens Ca(2+) channels in the presynaptic boutons to evoke transmitter release. However, when the postsynaptic responses were elicited by electrical stimulations, the presynaptic APs were usually not monitored. The reliability of presynaptic activation, the difference of AP firing thresholds between the first and the second pulses of PPS, and its relationship with P(r) and PPP have been largely ignored. Here we show that the AP firing thresholds in the same CA3 pyramidal cells (axons) are obviously lower for the second pulses of the PPS than for the first pulses. When single (or small numbers of) presynaptic axons were stimulated by low-intensity PPS, a large variation in the postsynaptic response probability of the first pulses (P(res1)) and PPP was observed. Increasing stimulation intensities resulted in the conversion of a lower P(res1) and PPF to a higher P(res1) and paired-pulse depression. These results indicate that changes in the reliability of AP initiation by the first pulse of the PPS may account for the high variability of P(res1) and PPP observed in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, therefore PPF may not be a reliable index of P(r) .",Excluded
1721,"Structure of (5'S)-8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine in DNA. Diastereomeric 8,5'-cyclopurine 2'-deoxynucleosides, containing a covalent bond between the deoxyribose and the purine base, represent an important class of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. The 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine lesion (cdG) has been recently reported to be a strong block of replication and highly mutagenic in Escherichia coli. The 8,5'-cyclopurine-2'-deoxyriboses are suspected to play a role in the etiology of neurodegeneration in xeroderma pigmentosum patients. These lesions cannot be repaired by base excision repair, but they are substrates for nucleotide excision repair. The structure of an oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing a site-specific S-cdG lesion placed opposite dC in the complementary strand was obtained by molecular dynamics calculations restrained by distance and dihedral angle restraints obtained from NMR spectroscopy. The S-cdG deoxyribose exhibited the O4'-exo (west) pseudorotation. Significant perturbations were observed for the beta, gamma, and chi torsion angles of the S-cdG nucleoside. Watson-Crick base pairing was conserved at the S-cdG.dC pair. However, the O4'-exo pseudorotation of the S-cdG deoxyribose perturbed the helical twist and base pair stacking at the lesion site and the 5'-neighbor dC.dG base pair. Thermodynamic destabilization of the duplex measured by UV melting experiments correlated with base stacking and structural perturbations involving the modified S-cdG.dC and 3'- neighbor dT.dA base pairs. These perturbations may be responsible for both the genotoxicity of this lesion and its ability to be recognized by nucleotide excision repair.",Excluded
1722,"Opposite effects of tetanic stimulation of the auditory thalamus or auditory cortex on the acoustic startle reflex in awake rats. The amygdala mediates both emotional learning and fear potentiation of startle. The lateral amygdala nucleus (LA) receives auditory inputs from both the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus; MGN) and auditory association cortex (AAC), and is critical for auditory fear conditioning. The central amygdala nucleus, which has intra-amygdaloid connections with LA, enhances startle magnitude via midbrain connections to the startle circuits. Tetanic stimulation of either MGN or AAC in vitro or in vivo can induce long-term potentiation in LA. In the present study, behavioural consequences of tetanization of these auditory afferents were investigated in awake rats. The acoustic startle reflex of rats was enhanced by tetanic stimulation of MGN, but suppressed by that of AAC. All the tetanization-induced changes of startle diminished within 24 h. Blockade of GABAB receptors in the LA area reversed the suppressive effect of tetanic stimulation of AAC on startle but did not change the enhancing effect of tetanic stimulation of MGN. Moreover, transient electrical stimulation of MGN enhanced the acoustic startle reflex when it lagged behind acoustic stimulation, but inhibited the acoustic startle reflex when it preceded acoustic stimulation. The results of the present study indicate that MGN and AAC afferents to LA play different roles in emotional modulation of startle, and AAC afferents are more influenced by inhibitory GABAB transmission in LA.",Excluded
1723,"Human biodistribution and radiation dosimetry for the tau tracer <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351. Background: <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 is a novel radiotracer demonstrating high binding selectivity and affinity for tau over amyloid pathology and better pharmacokinetics in the brain than previous THK probes. Our aim was to estimate the radiation dose of <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 in human, and then compare the clinical radiation dosimetry results to estimations in previously published preclinical data. Method(s): Serial whole body PET/CT imaging was performed over 240 min on 7 healthy volunteers after injection of 377+/-18.6 MBq (range, 340.7 - 388.9 MBq) of <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351. The bladder and gallbladder were delineated from PET images, and other organs were delineated on CT images. Voided urine activity was recorded. The decay-corrected and normalized <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 activity of 15 source organ regions as a function of time was entered into the OLINDA/EXM software to calculate the effective dose of each subject following the medical internal radiation dosimetry schema. Result(s): <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 injection was well tolerated. The highest mean initial uptakes at 10 minutes post injection were measured in the liver (10.8%), lung (6.1%), kidney (1.5%), and brain (1.0%). The highest mean radiation absorbed doses were received by the gallbladder wall (211mGy/MBq), upper large intestine (93 mGy/MBq) and small intestine (82 mGy/MBq). The resultant whole-body effective dose was 22.0 mSv/MBq. Conclusion(s): A routine injection of 370 MBq of <sup>18</sup>F-THK-5351 would lead to an estimated effective dose of 8.1 mSv, which shows similar radiation burdens to widely used common clinical tracers.

1724,"Redox balance- and radiation-mediated alteration in hippocampal neurogenesis. Changes in the intracellular and extracellular redox balance have been correlated with cell fate decisions in terms of proliferation versus differentiation, entering versus existing cell cycle and survival versus cell death. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been correlated with neuronal plasticity of learning and memory; however, the process is exquisitely sensitive to changes in redox balance. Cranial irradiation is an effective modality in treating brain tumours but often leads to deficits in hippocampus-related learning and memory, which is most likely due to sustained elevation of oxygen free radical production and suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. The subcellular redox environment affecting hippocampal neurogenesis is largely unknown. Using mutant mice deficient in each one of the three superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) isoforms, we have begun to determine the consequences of SOD deficiency in hippocampal neurogenesis and the related functions of learning and memory under normal condition and following cranial irradiation.",Excluded
1725,"Oxidative stress and adult neurogenesis-Effects of radiation and superoxide dismutase deficiency. Hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory and in spatial navigation. Production of new neurons that are functionally integrated into the hippocampal neuronal network is important for the maintenance of functional plasticity. In adults, production of new neurons in the hippocampus takes place in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of dentate gyrus. Neural progenitor/stem cells go through processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and maturation. This process is exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress, and perturbation in the redox balance in the neurogenic microenvironment can lead to reduced neurogenesis. Cranial irradiation is an effective treatment for primary and secondary brain tumors. However, even low doses of irradiation can lead to persistent elevation of oxidative stress and sustained suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are major antioxidant enzymes for the removal of superoxide radicals in different subcellular compartments. To identify the subcellular location where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated after cranial irradiation, different SOD deficient mice have been used to determine the effects of irradiation on hippocampal neurogenesis. The study results suggest that, regardless of the subcellular location, SOD deficiency leads to a significant reduction in the production of new neurons in the SGZ of hippocampal dentate gyrus. In exchange, the generation of new glial cells was significantly increased. The SOD deficient condition, however, altered the tissue response to irradiation, and SOD deficient mice were able to maintain a similar level of neurogenesis after irradiation while wild type mice showed a significant reduction in the production of new neurons. © 2012.",Included
1726,"Variation of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer birefringence in normal human subjects. PURPOSE: The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) exhibits linear birefringence due to the oriented cylindrical structure of ganglion cell axons. The birefringence (Deltan) depends on the density and composition of axonal organelles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distribution of birefringence around the optic nerve head (ONH) in normal subjects.METHODS: Birefringence was calculated along circular scan paths around the ONH as Deltan = R/T, where R is RNFL retardance measured by scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) and T is RNFL thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT scans on a 3.4 mm diameter circle were obtained from 26 normal subjects aged 18 to 53 years. Scans on circles with various diameters were obtained from 17 of these subjects.RESULTS: The average reproducibility of Deltan measured on three separate days in four subjects was +/- 0.05 nm/microm. In most subjects Deltan varied significantly along a circular path around the ONH, with maxima in superior and inferior bundles, minima temporally and nasally, and a mean of 0.32 +/- 0.03 nm/microm. Deltan profiles on circles of different diameter were similar, suggesting that Deltan did not vary along nerve fiber bundles.CONCLUSIONS: RNFL birefringence varies with position around the ONH. This variation may result from known structural differences among nerve fiber bundles that serve different retinal regions. Constant Deltan along bundles is consistent with this hypothesis. Measurements of RNFL birefringence may provide a means to detect early subcellular changes in glaucoma.",Excluded
1727,"Wavelength-dependent change of retinal nerve fiber layer reflectance in glaucomatous retinas. PURPOSE: Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) reflectance is often used in optical methods for RNFL assessment in clinical diagnosis of glaucoma, yet little is known about the reflectance property of the RNFL under the development of glaucoma. This study measured the changes in RNFL reflectance spectra that occurred in retinal nerve fiber bundles with different degrees of glaucomatous damage.METHODS: A rat model of glaucoma with laser photocoagulation of trabecular meshwork was used. Reflectance of the RNFL in an isolated retina was measured at wavelengths of 400-830 nm. Cytostructural distribution of the bundles measured optically was evaluated by confocal imaging of immunohistochemistry staining of cytoskeletal components, F-actin, microtubules, and neurofilaments. RNFL reflectance spectra were studied in bundles with normal-looking appearance, early F-actin distortion, and apparent damage of all cytoskeletal components. Changes of RNFL reflectance spectra were studied at different radii (0.22, 0.33, and 0.44 mm) from the optic nerve head (ONH).RESULTS: Bundles in 30 control retinas and 41 glaucomatous retinas were examined. In normal retinas, reflectance spectra were similar along the same bundles. In glaucomatous retinas, reflectance spectra changed along bundles with the spectra becoming flatter as bundle areas approached the ONH.CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) causes nonuniform changes in RNFL reflectance across wavelengths. Changes of reflectance spectra occur early in bundles near the ONH and prior to apparent cytoskeletal distortion. Using the ratio of RNFL reflectance measured at different wavelengths can provide early and sensitive detection of glaucomatous damage.",Excluded
1728,"Measurements and models of electric fields in the in vivo human brain during transcranial electric stimulation. Transcranial electric stimulation aims to stimulate the brain by applying weak electrical currents at the scalp.

We measured electric potentials intracranially in ten epilepsy patients and estimated electric fields across the entire brain by leveraging calibrated current-flow models. When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.8 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (r = 0.86) and depth (r = 0.88) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments.

1729,"Protection of normal brain cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis by a mitochondria-targeted triphenyl-phosphonium-nitroxide: a possible utility in glioblastoma therapy. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor. A strong rationale to identify innovative approaches to treat these tumors is required since treatment failures result in local recurrences and median survivals range from 9 to 12 months. Glioma cells are reported to have less mitochondrial content compared to adjacent normal brain cells. Based on this difference, we suggest a new strategy, utilizing protection of normal brain cells by mitochondria-targeted electron scavengers and antioxidants-nitroxides-thus allowing for the escalation of the radiation doses. In this paper, we report that a conjugate of nitroxide with a hydrophobic cation, triphenyl-phosphonium (TPEY-Tempo), significantly protected brain endothelial cells from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis while radiosensitizing brain tumor cells. Thus, TPEY-Tempo may be a promising adjunct in the treatment of glioblastoma with the potential to not only prolong survival but also to maintain quality of life and reduce treatment toxicity.",Included

Purpose: High-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is a common treatment option for locally advanced prostate cancer. Quality of life is an important factor when discussing therapy options for high-risk prostate cancer. This study evaluated adverse effects and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).Materials and Methods: Ninety male patients (median age, 71 years; range, 50 to 79 years) with high-risk prostate cancer underwent HDR-BT after EBRT between December 2009 and January 2017 with a median follow-up of 43 months. A total of 57 patients (69.5%) answered the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life of Cancer Patients questionnaire (QLQ-C30; ver. 3.0), and 8 patients died during follow-up. In order to put the results of this study in context, we compared the results with reference data from the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual. Correlations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, International Prostate Symptom Score, and HRQOL measures were calculated.Results: The study participants reported better physical functioning and better global health compared with the reference data, but worse social, role, and cognitive functioning. We found negative statistically significant correlations between the last-measured PSA value and social functioning (p>0.01), cognitive functioning, pain, and constipation (all p<0.05). Toxicity rates were 10.0% for gastrointestinal and 12.2% for genitourinary adverse effects. All reported complications for toxicity were Grade I.Conclusions: The described therapy results in high biochemical control rates with minimal adverse effects.

Early detection of SCLC through screening is under investigation. Chemotherapy, generally a platinum-based combination, is the mainstay of therapy and is generally combined with radiation in the first-line treatment of tumours up to stage IIIb. Surgery has a place in the diagnosis and therapy of stage I SCLC, but plays no key role in advanced cancer. In patients who respond to first-line therapy, prophylactic cranial irradiation can prevent brain metastases and improve overall survival.

Polyunsaturated phospholipids are known to be important with regard to the biological functions of essential fatty acids, for example, involving neural tissues such as the brain and retina. Here we have employed two complementary structural methods for the study of polyunsaturated bilayer lipids, viz. deuterium ((2)H) NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. Our research constitutes one of the first applications of all-atom MD simulations to polyunsaturated lipids containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 cis-Delta(4,7,10,13,16,19)). Structural features of the highly unsaturated, mixed-chain phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PDPC), have been studied in the liquid-crystalline (L(alpha)) state and compared to the less unsaturated homolog, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC). The (2)H NMR spectra of polyunsaturated bilayers are dramatically different from those of less unsaturated phospholipid bilayers. We show how use of MD simulations can aid in interpreting the complex (2)H NMR spectra of polyunsaturated bilayers, in conjunction with electron density profiles determined from small-angle X-ray diffraction studies. This work clearly demonstrates preferred helical and angle-iron conformations of the polyunsaturated chains in liquid-crystalline bilayers, which favor chain extension while maintaining bilayer flexibility. The presence of relatively long, extended fatty acyl chains may be important for solvating the hydrophobic surfaces of integral membrane proteins, such as rhodopsin. In addition, the polyallylic DHA chains have a tendency to adopt back-bended (hairpin-like) structures, which increase the interfacial area per lipid. Finally, the material properties have been analyzed in terms of the response of the bilayer to mechanical stress. Simulated bilayers of phospholipids containing docosahexaenoic acid were less sensitive to the applied surface tension than were saturated phospholipids, possibly implying a decrease in membrane elasticity (area elastic modulus, bending rigidity). The above features distinguish DHA-containing lipids from saturated or monounsaturated lipids and may be important for their biological modes of action.",Excluded

1735,"Spinal cord compression in prostate cancer: treatment outcome and prognostic factors. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord compression (SCC) is an important complication of metastatic prostate cancer. We have analysed patients treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital to assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors in this patients group.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of 69 patients with spinal cord compression and prostate cancer treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital.RESULTS: At presentation 40 (58%) patients were non-ambulant and 52% were catheterised. Diagnosis was established by myelography in 42% and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 47% of patients. MRI detected significantly more patients with multiple sites of compression (51 versus 7%, P < 0.001). SCC was present at the initial diagnosis of prostatic cancer in 13 patients and 17 patients had received no hormone treatment prior to diagnosis. Following treatment 36 (52%) patients had a functional improvement of motor power with 25/40 (63%) non-ambulant patients becoming ambulant. Seventy-seven percent of patients who had eventual improvement had some improvement in power within 7 days. On multivariate analysis a single level of compression, no previous hormone therapy and a young age (<65 years) predicted for better outcome. When these factors were included an increased radiation dose (>30 Gy) or the addition of surgery did not improve the functional outcome. Following initial recovery; there was a 45% risk of developing a further episode of cord compression at the same or new site by 2 years with a median time to progression of 236 days (range 47-1215 days). The median survival was 115 days (range 5-2016 days) with 25% of patients surviving for 2 years. Patients with no prior hormone therapy had a median survival of 627 days (range 46-1516 days). Other predictors of improved survival on multivariate analysis were a single site of compression and a haemoglobin over 12 g.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of SCC in prostate cancer results in improved motor function in the majority of patients. Long-term survival is possible, especially in good performance status patients with no prior hormone treatment. Survivors remain at high risk of subsequent neurological relapse. An early improvement in motor power is a strong predictor of subsequent functional improvement. MRI detects additional sites of asymptomatic SCC which makes it the investigation of choice.",Excluded

Purpose: A phase I dose escalation of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (H-SRT) in recurrent or persistent malignant gliomas as a means of increasing the biologically effective dose and decreasing the high rate of reoperation due to toxicity associated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and brachytherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): From November 1994 to September 1996, 25 lesions in 20 patients with clinical and/or imaging evidence of malignant glioma persistence or recurrence received salvage H-SRT, Nineteen patients at the time of initial diagnosis had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and one patient had an anaplastic astrocytoma. All of these patients with tumor persistence or recurrence had received initial fractionated radiation therapy (RT) with a mean and median dose of 60 Gy (44.0-72.0 Gy). The median time from completion of initial RT to H-SRT was 3.1 months (0.7-45.5 months). Salvage H-SRT was delivered using daily 3.0- 3.5 Gy fractions (fxs). Three different total dose levels were sequentially evaluated: 24.0 Gy/3.0 Gy fxs (five lesions), 30.0 Gy/3.0 Gy fxs (10 lesions), and 35.0 Gy/3.5 Gy fxs (nine lesions). Median treated tumor volume measured 12.66 cc (0.89-47.5 cc). The median ratio of prescription volume to tumor volume was 2,8 (1.4-5.0). Toxicity was judged by RTOG criteria. Response was determined by clinical neurologic improvement, a decrease in steroid dose without clinical deterioration, and/or radiologic imaging. Result(s): No grade 3 toxicities were observed and no reoperation due to toxicity was required. At the time of analysis, 13 of 20 patients had died. The median survival time from the completion of H-SRT is 10.5 months with a 1-year survival rate of 20%. Neurological improvement was found in 45% of patients. Decreased steroid requirements occurred in 60% of patients. Minor imaging response was noted in 22% of patients. Using Fisher's exact test, response of any kind correlated strongly to total dose (p = 0.0056). None of six lesions treated with 21 Gy or 24 Gy responded, whereas there was a 79% response rate among the 19 lesions treated with 30 or 35 Gy. Tumor volumes <=20 cc were associated with a higher likelihood of response (p = 0.053). Conclusion(s): H-SRT used in this cohort of previously irradiated patients with malignant glioma was not associated with the need for reoperation due to toxicity or grade 3 toxicity. This low toxicity profile and encouraging H- SRT dose-related response outcome justifies further evaluation and dose escalation.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SABR in treating well-differentiated neuroendocrine liver metastases (WD-NELM). METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients with WD-NELM treated with SABR between January 2015-July 2019. Demographic, treatment and clinical/radiographic follow-up data were abstracted. RECIST 1.1 criteria were applied to each individual target to evaluate the response to treatment. Local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) were determined using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Toxicity was reported according to CTCAE v5.0. RESULT(S): Twenty-five patients with a total of 53 liver metastases treated with SABR were identified. Most patients (68%) had midgut tumors, were Grade II (80%) and had high volume intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic disease (76%). Median number of liver metastases treated was 2 with a median size of 2.5 cm. Median radiation dose delivered was 50Gy/5 fractions. Median follow-up was 14 months; 24 of the 25 patients were alive at time of analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was 32%, with improvement or stability in 96% of lesions treated.

1738,"Treatment decisions in a man with Hodgkin lymphoma and Guillian-Barre syndrome: A case report. Introduction: Guillain-Barre syndrome, or acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, has been described in the presence of malignancies such as lymphoma. Guillain-Barre syndrome/acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy causes paresthesias and weakness, which can make the treatment of lymphoma with chemotherapy challenging. Given the rarity of this co-presentation it is not known if the effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome should be considered when selecting a treatment regimen for Hodgkin lymphoma. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of these treatment modifications has not been previously reported. Case presentation: We report the case of a 37-year-old Caucasian man with a diagnosis of stage IIB classical Hodgkin lymphoma with concomitant Guillain-Barre syndrome. Our patient originally presented with an enlarged cervical lymph node and quickly developed distal paresthesia and progressive weakness of all four extremities. He was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and initiated on treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. Doses of bleomycin and vinblastine were held or dose-reduced throughout his initial treatment course due to underlying neuropathy and dyspnea. He continued to have persistent disease after five cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine and went on to receive salvage treatments including more chemotherapy, radiation, autologous stem cell transplant and is currently preparing for an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Conclusion(s): Paraneoplastic syndromes such as Guillain-Barre syndrome/acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy can make the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma more challenging and can interfere with delivering full-dose chemotherapy. Further case series are needed to evaluate the effect that paraneoplastic syndromes, or adjustments made in therapy due to these syndromes, negatively affect the prognosis of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

1739,"Vaccination of chicks against Plasmodium gallinaceum by erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic parasites attenuated by gamma irradiation. Plasmodium gallinaceum-infected blood which received up to 24 krad during exposure to gamma-rays from a cobalt-60 source produced infections of normal course and duration when injected into chickens. The prepatent period advanced with increasing exposure of infected blood to radiation, suggesting some degree of attenuation. At 26, 28 and 30 krad, the infections were transient and the parasites were morphologically abnormal. It is thought that the amount of radiation required to render the parasites non-viable is about 45 krad for an inoculum of 10(6) parasites. There is evidence that exoerythrocytic stages may be more susceptible to gamma-rays than are blood parasites. Chickens were inoculated three times, over a period of four weeks, with vaccines prepared from gamma-irradiated infected blood and brain tissue. Half the birds which had been inoculated with attenuated parasitized blood exhibited mild infections during vaccination, and they were the only birds to show at challenge immunity to both homologous blood and exoerythrocytic parasites.",Included
1740,"Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of the region of the sella turcica. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging is a versatile technique which has proved more sensitive in the detection of perisellar lesions than CT. A multiplanar facility, the demonstration of blood flow, and the lack of bone artefacts are its main advantages in this respect. Limitations are seen in its inability to identify small calcifications and to distinguish clearly perifocal oedema and tumour especially in malignant lesions. Relatively thick slices of 5-10 mm make the detection of microadenomas very difficult, mainly because of partial volume effects. T1 and T2 values alone are not sufficient to provide specific diagnosis. No reliable criteria have been determined yet, which would indicate the quality of pathological involvement of peritumorous structures by tumours of the sella region. At present NMR still plays a more complementary role to CT in the evaluation of this complex anatomical area. We are confident that with future technical refinements NMR will be able to replace ionizing radiation for the diagnostic imaging of the sella.",Excluded

The optimal treatment for recurrent high-grade gliomas is unknown and a standard of care does not exist. Re-irradiation with concomitant bevacizumab represents an option. Retrospectively, we analyzed a cohort of heavily pretreated patients (n = 14) with relapsing HGGs who underwent re-irradiation with conventional 3D-conformal or intensified modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Ten of them received re-irradiation in combination with bevacizumab. The study population consisted of eight GBMs and six anaplastic gliomas. All patients had previously undergone irradiation for first-line therapy, including seven patients with radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. Patients without contraindications started with two infusions of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg of body weight every other week) prior to re-irradiation and continued through re-irradiation until progression. The median patient age was 45 years with a median Karnofsky performance scale of 70. The median dose of re-irradiation was 41.6 Gy [39-55 Gy]. The median physical cumulative radiation dose was 101.6 Gy [65-110.4 Gy]. The median PFS from re-irradiation was 5.1 months [1.6-17.4] based on clinical and RANO criteria.

Purpose: Intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL) is rare and usually goes undiagnosed until the time of autopsy because of its protean neurological manifestations. Case Report: In this report, we describe two women who developed rapidly recurrent strokes within one to two months. In both cases, brain magnetic resonance imaging showed progression of bilateral cerebral infarcts, and histopathology from brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of IVL. The first case did not receive chemotherapy and died of septic shock one month after diagnosis. The second case received whole brain radiotherapy followed by rituximab-containing chemotherapy, and experienced partial improvement of neurological deficits. However, she began to deteriorate in consciousness at 8 months and became stuporous at 10 months after the onset of symptoms. Conclusion(s): IVL should be considered as a possible etiology if multiple strokes occur in a short period of time.",Excluded
1743,"Effect of proton pump inhibitors in hospitalization on mortality of patients with hepatic encephalopathy and cirrhosis but no active gastrointestinal bleeding. BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric complication of decompensated cirrhosis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), used as potent acid suppressants, are associated with HE occurrence in cirrhotic patients. However, it is still unknown if PPIs contribute to mortality in cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastrointestinal bleeding.METHODS: We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database to identify 1004 cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastric bleeding, who received oral PPIs between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. On the basis of comorbid disorder data, we used propensity score matching at a 1:4 ratio to select 4016 cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastric bleeding who did not receive PPIs as a comparison group. All patients were followed up for one year from the index time.RESULTS: The overall 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities were 36.1%, 52.6%, and 70.1% in PPI group, and 27.5%, 41.7%, and 62.4% in non-PPI group. Using Cox regression model analysis with adjustment for age, gender, and other comorbid disorders, we obtained hazard ratios of 1.360 (95% CI: 1.208-1.532, P<0.001), 1.563 (95% CI: 1.314-1.859; P<0.001), and 1.187 (95% CI: 1.008-1.398; P=0.040) for, respectively, 30-day, 30-day to 90-day, and 90-day to 1-year mortality in patients taking PPIs.CONCLUSION: PPIs increase short-term and long-term mortality of cirrhotic patients with HE and no active gastrointestinal bleeding.",Excluded
1744,"Multisensory plasticity in congenitally deaf mice: how are cortical areas functionally specified?. The neocortex of congenitally deaf mice was examined using electrophysiological recording techniques combined with cortical myeloarchitecture. Our results indicate that relative activity patterns across sensory systems during development contribute to modality assignment of cortical fields as well as the size of cortical fields. In congenitally deaf mice, ""auditory cortex"" contained neurons that responded to somatosensory, visual, or both somatosensory and visual stimulation; the primary visual area contained a larger proportion of neurons that responded to somatosensory stimulation than in normal animals, and the primary visual area had significantly increased in size. Thus, cortical architecture and functional specification were de-correlated. When results are considered in the light of molecular studies and studies in which peripheral activity is altered in development, it becomes clear that similar types of changes to the neocortex, such as alterations in cortical field size, can be achieved in more than one way in the developing and evolving neocortex.",Excluded
1745,"Electrophysiological characterisation of central sensitisation in canine spontaneous osteoarthritis. In man, central sensitisation (CS) contributes to the pain of osteoarthritis (OA). Dogs with spontaneous OA may also exhibit CS. Electrophysiological reflex measurements are more objective than behavioural assessments and can be used to evaluate CS in preclinical and clinical studies. It was hypothesised that dogs suffering from OA would exhibit electrophysiological characteristics indicative of CS, associated with reduced diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNICs). One hundred and seventeen client-owned dogs were recruited to the study. Hind limb nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds, stimulus response, and temporal summation characteristics were recorded, during alfaxalone anaesthesia, from 46 OA dogs, 29 OA dogs receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OANSAIDs), and 27 breed- and weight-matched control dogs. Efficacy of DNIC was evaluated in 12 control and 11 of the OA dogs, by application of a mechanical conditioning stimulus to the contralateral forelimb. Nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds were higher in OA compared with control dogs (P = 0.02). Stimulus response characteristics demonstrated an augmented response in OANSAID dogs compared with OA (P < 0.001) and control (P < 0.001) dogs. Temporal summation demonstrated exaggerated C-fibre-mediated responses in both OA (P < 0.001) and OANSAID (P = 0.005) groups, compared with control animals. Conditioning stimulus application resulted in inhibition of test reflex responses in both OA and control animals (P < 0.001); control animals demonstrated greater inhibition compared with OA (P = 0.0499). These data provide evidence of neurophysiological changes consistent with CS in dogs with spontaneous OA and demonstrate that canine OA is associated with reduced DNIC.",Excluded

1747,"The susceptibility of the retina to photochemical damage from visible light. The photoreceptor/RPE complex must maintain a delicate balance between maximizing the absorption of photons for vision and retinal image quality while simultaneously minimizing the risk of photodamage when exposed to bright light. We review the recent discovery of two new effects of light exposure on the photoreceptor/RPE complex in the context of current thinking about the causes of retinal phototoxicity. These effects are autofluorescence photobleaching in which exposure to bright light reduces lipofuscin autofluorescence and, at higher light levels, RPE disruption in which the pattern of autofluorescence is permanently altered following light exposure. Both effects occur following exposure to visible light at irradiances that were previously thought to be safe. Photopigment, retinoids involved in the visual cycle, and bisretinoids in lipofuscin have been implicated as possible photosensitizers for photochemical damage. The mechanism of RPE disruption may follow either of these paths. On the other hand, autofluorescence photobleaching is likely an indicator of photooxidation of lipofuscin. The permanent changes inherent in RPE disruption might require modification of the light safety standards. AF photobleaching recovers after several hours although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet clear. Understanding the mechanisms of phototoxicity is all the more important given the potential for increased susceptibility in the presence of ocular diseases that affect either the visual cycle and/or lipofuscin accumulation. In addition, knowledge of photochemical mechanisms can improve our understanding of some disease processes that may be influenced by light exposure, such as some forms of Leber's congenital amaurosis, and aid in the development of new therapies. Such treatment prior to intentional light exposures, as in ophthalmic examinations or surgeries, could provide an effective preventative strategy.",Excluded
1748,"Purkinje-cell-restricted restoration of Kv3.3 function restores complex spikes and rescues motor coordination in Kcnc3 mutants. The fast-activating/deactivating voltage-gated potassium channel Kv3.3 (Kcnc3) is expressed in various neuronal cell types involved in motor function, including cerebellar Purkinje cells. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13) patients carrying dominant-negative mutations in Kcnc3 and Kcnc3-null mutant mice both display motor incoordination, suggested in mice by increased lateral deviation while ambulating and slips on a narrow beam. Motor skill learning, however, is spared. Mice lacking Kcnc3 also exhibit muscle twitches. In addition to broadened spikes, recordings of Kcnc3-null Purkinje cells revealed fewer spikelets in complex spikes and a lower intraburst frequency. Targeted reexpression of Kv3.3 channels exclusively in Purkinje cells in Kcnc3-null mice as well as in mice also heterozygous for Kv3.1 sufficed to restore simple spike brevity along with normal complex spikes and to rescue specifically coordination. Therefore, spike parameters requiring Kv3.3 function in Purkinje cells are involved in the ataxic null phenotype and motor coordination, but not motor learning.",Excluded
1749,"Variability in EMF permittivity values: implications for SAR calculations. Digital anatomical models of man and animals are available for use in numerical calculations to predict electromagnetic field (EMF)-induced specific absorption rate (SAR) values. To use these models, permittivity values are assigned to the various tissues for the EMF frequencies of interest. There is, as yet, no consensus on what are the best permittivity data. This study analyzed the variability in published permittivity data and investigated the effects of permittivity values that are proportional on SAR calculations. Whole-sphere averaged and localized SAR values along the diameter of a 4-cm sphere are calculated for EMF exposures in the radio frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 GHz. When the dimensions of a sphere are small compared to the wavelength (i.e., wavelength inside the material is greater than ten times the dimensions of the object), the whole-sphere averaged SAR is inversely proportional to the permittivity of the material composing the sphere. However, the localized SAR values generally do not have the same relation and, as a matter of fact, vary greatly depending on the location within the sphere. These results indicate that care must be taken in choosing the permittivity values used in calculating SAR values and some estimate of the dependence of the calculated SAR values on variability in permittivity should be determined.",Excluded

Purpose: Optical tomography (OCT) was successfully used to investigate tissue changes after photocoagulation. It is able to grade the strength and spatial extension of the lesions with high accuracy. We developed a high-speed OCT (840 nm, 200,000 A-scans/s) and a slitlamp-based OCT (1060 nm, 90,000 A-scans/s), to visualizes effects of the laser irradiation during laser exposure. Based on ex-vivo results changes in tissue scattering and, by use of the Doppler signal, tissue motion caused by thermal expansion and coagulation-induced tissue contraction were measured in rabbits. Aim was to develop algorithms for quantitative detection of visible photocoagulation lesions in-vivo. Method(s): OCT image series (up to 1000 B-Scans/s) were recorded in Chinchilla Grey rabbits during laser exposure. Lesions were applied with different spot size and exposure times. Irradiance was varied from below threshold until strong lesions were visible in the fundus. Using cross-correlation of images, motion due to heart beat was corrected. More than 200 lesions having sufficient image quality with respect to noise and motion artifacts were evaluated. Tissue scattering and axial movement of the neuronal retina was automatically determined from the images sequence and 26 different parameters were calculated which were then correlated with the ophthalmoscopic visibility of the lesions. Sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were calculated. Result(s): During coagulation an increase of scattering was observed near the retinal pigment epithelium. It predicted the ophthalmoscopic visibility of lesions with 80% sensitivity and 78% specificity. Area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.78, Youden index 0.58. Axial tissue motion predicted lesions only with a Youden index of 0.45; sensitivity and specificity were 63% and 80%, respectively. The AUC was 0.74. Considerably better results were obtained when the local tissue expansion was calculated. This parameter is sensitive to local changes of the tissue morphology and corrects for global tissue motion. AUC reached 0.82 with 71% sensitivity, 91% specificity and a Youden index of 0.62. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, high-speed OCT recording during photocoagulation was able to predict the visibility of the lesion with good reliability. It does provide information on tissue effects of photocoagulation and may be used for an online dosimetry.",Excluded

Fifteen patients already had a follow-up after the treatment, and they were observed for the minimum of 12 and the maximum of 120 months, median 54 months. The group of patients consisted of 8 women and 7 men with the median age of 45 years. Seven patients underwent one to three microsurgical operations before radjosurgery.

Thirteen patients were subjected to irradiation of the whole tumour volume, in two cases the irradiation was only partial. The minimum tumour marginal dose ranged from 10 to 15 Gy (median 12 Gy) and it was delivered to 50% isoclose line. The tumour growth control was reached in 93% (14 cases). In 3 patients, the tumour regressed completely, and in 8 patients there occurred a significant reduction of the tumour volume. No further tumour growth was seen in one case, progress appeared in three cases. Eleven (73%) patients showed clinical improvement, 2 were without any change, and new neurological symptoms occurred in one patient. The fifteenth patient whose large tumour compressing the brain stem had been subjected to partial irradiation died of septicaemia 9 months after the treatment. Five patients had a cystic type of schwannomas, and four of them suffered from transient neurological deficits after irradiation as a consequence of an enlargement of the cystic part of the tumour.

This information about nigro-striatal and sympathetic cardiac neuronal loss may contribute to the early diagnosis of PD and provide relevant elements for differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndrome. The main limitation to investigate these different neuronal systems, is related to the need of two scans, with two tracers and double radiation exposure for patients. <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA is a dopamine precursor able to evaluate synthetic and storage capacity of dopamine in pre-synaptic terminals.

Excessive light causes damage to photoreceptor and pigment epithelial cells, and a local edema in the outer retina. Since Muller glial cells normally mediate the osmohomeostasis in the inner retina (mainly via channel-mediated transport of potassium and water), we determined whether retinal light injury causes an alteration in the retinal localization of glial water (aquaporin-4) and potassium (Kir4.1) channels, and in the potassium conductance of Muller cells. Mice were treated with bright white light (intensity, 15,000lx) for 2h. Light treatment results in Muller cell gliosis as indicated by the enhanced staining of the glial fibrillary acidic protein and an increase in the cell membrane area reflecting cellular hypertrophy. In light-injured retinas, the immunostaining of the photoreceptor water channel aquaporin-1 disappeared along with the degeneration of the outer retina, and the outer nuclear layer contained large spherical bodies representing photoreceptor nuclei which were fused together. The immunostainings of the aquaporin-4 and Kir4.1 proteins were increased in the outer retina after light treatment. Since the amplitude of the potassium currents of Muller cells remained largely unaltered, the increase in the Kir4.1 immunostaining is supposed to be caused by a redistribution of the channel protein. The data indicate that Muller glial cells respond to excessive light with an alteration in the localization of Kir4.1 and aquaporin-4 proteins; this alteration is thought to be a response to the edema in the outer retina and may support the resolution of edema.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To assess patient radiation doses during cerebral angiography and embolization of intracranial aneurysms across multi-centers and propose a diagnostic reference level (DRL).MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied a sample of 490 diagnostic and 371 therapeutic procedures for intracranial aneurysms, which were performed at 23 hospitals in Korea in 2015. Parameters including dose-area product (DAP), cumulative air kerma (CAK), fluoroscopic time and total angiographic image frames were obtained and analyzed.RESULTS: Total mean DAP, CAK, fluoroscopy time, and total angiographic image frames were 106.2 +/- 66.4 Gy-cm(2), 697.1 +/- 473.7 mGy, 9.7 +/- 6.5 minutes, 241.5 +/- 116.6 frames for diagnostic procedures, 218.8 +/- 164.3 Gy-cm(2), 3365.7 +/- 2205.8 mGy, 51.5 +/- 31.1 minutes, 443.5 +/- 270.7 frames for therapeutic procedures, respectively. For diagnostic procedure, the third quartiles for DRLs were 144.2 Gy-cm(2) for DAP, 921.1 mGy for CAK, 12.2 minutes for fluoroscopy times and 286.5 for number of image frames, respectively. For therapeutic procedures, the third quartiles for DRLs were 271.0 Gy-cm(2) for DAP, 4471.3 mGy for CAK, 64.7 minutes for fluoroscopy times and 567.3 for number of image frames, respectively. On average, rotational angiography was used 1.5 +/- 0.7 times/session (range, 0-4; n=490) for diagnostic procedures and 1.6 +/- 1.2 times/session (range, 0-4; n=368) for therapeutic procedures, respectively.CONCLUSION: Radiation dose as measured by DAP, fluoroscopy time and image frames were lower in our patients compared to another study regarding cerebral angiography, and DAP was lower with fewer angiographic image frames for therapeutic procedures. Proposed DRLs can be used for quality assurance and patient safety in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.",Excluded

1768,"Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo are epigenetically regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Exposure of animal body parts to ionizing radiation (IR) can lead to molecular changes in distant shielded ""bystander"" tissues and organs. Nevertheless, tissue specificity of bystander responses within the same organism has not been examined in detail. Studies on in vivo bystander effect conducted so far analyzed changes induced by single-dose exposure. The potential of fractionated irradiation to induce bystander effects in vivo has never been studied. We analyzed changes in global DNA methylation and microRNAome in skin and spleen of animals subjected to single-dose (acute or fractionated) whole-body or cranial exposure to 0.5 Gy of X-rays. We found that IR-induced DNA methylation changes in bystander spleen and skin were distinct. Acute radiation exposure resulted in a significant loss of global DNA methylation in the exposed and bystander spleen 6 hr, 96 hr, and 14 days after irradiation. Fractionated irradiation led to hypomethylation in bystander spleen 6 hr after whole-body exposure, and 6 hr, 96 hr, and 14 days after cranial irradiation. Contrarily, changes in the skin of the same animals were seen only 6 hr after acute whole-body and head exposure. DNA hypomethylation observed in spleen was paralleled by a reduction of methyl-binding protein MeCP2 expression. Irradiation also induced tissue-specific microRNAome alterations in skin and spleen. For the first time, we have shown that IR-induced epigenetic bystander effects that occur in the same organism are triggered by both acute and fractionated exposure and are very distinct in different bystander organs. Future studies are clearly needed to address organismal and carcinogenic repercussions of those changes.",Included
1769,"Intraocular gene transfer of pigment epithelium-derived factor rescues photoreceptors from light-induced cell death. In this study, we investigated whether intraocular gene transfer of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) ameliorates the extent of light-induced photoreceptor cell death. Lewis rats received intravitreous injection of 3 x 10(9) particles of adenoviral vector expressing PEDF (AdPEDF.11) in one eye and 3 x 10(9) particles of empty adenoviral vector (AdNull.11) in the contralateral eye. The rats were then dark-adapted for 3 days after which they were continuously exposed to fluorescent light (2,500 lux) for 0, 6, 24, 96, and 168 h. Both eyes were then enucleated and processed for morphometric analysis. Cell death in the retina was examined using TUNEL staining with a propidium iodide counterstain. The photoreceptor cell counts in each of the three groups were significantly different (P < 0.001). Eyes that received intravitreous injection of AdNull.11 or no injection showed a greater number of pyknotic photoreceptor cells and a reduced photoreceptor cell density as compared to eyes treated with intravitreous AdPEDF.11 injection. AdNull.11 treated eyes showed a lesser but still significant protection of photoreceptor cells when compared to untreated eyes. Fewer TUNEL-positive photoreceptor cells were present in AdPEDF.11 treated eyes than in AdNull.11 treated or untreated eyes (P = 0.004). The amplitudes of the ERG a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potentials (OPs) were increased significantly by treatment (P < 0.05). These data suggest that adenovirus vector-mediated intraocular expression of PEDF significantly increases photoreceptor cell survival following excessive light exposure. Neuroprotection may result from inhibition of light-induced apoptotic processes. This study provides proof of concept for a gene transfer approach to modulating retinal cell death resulting from photo-oxidative damage and supports the hypothesis that gene transfer of PEDF is broadly applicable to modulating apoptosis in the retina.",Excluded
1770,"Dose reduction and image quality in CT angiography for cerebral aneurysm with various tube potentials and current settings. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate the image quality on both axial and three-dimensional CT angiograms of the brain at various tube potentials and currents, and to propose the use of descriptors for evaluating the image quality of three-dimensional CT angiograms using entropy analysis. Method(s): A head phantom was used as a target object. Axial CT and threedimensional CT angiograms were obtained at various effective milliampere-second values (49-350 mAs) and tube potentials (80-140 kVp) with a 64-row detector CT scanner. Lens doses were measured using a planar silicon pin-photodiode system. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and streak artefacts on the axial CT angiograms were evaluated and the image quality of the three-dimensional CT angiograms was assessed using entropy analysis. Result(s): Lens doses increased with tube potential and effective milliampere-seconds. From the evaluation of SNR and streak artefacts on axial CT angiograms, we found that the image quality was improved by setting the tube potential at 100 kVp. However, there was little visual difference in the image quality for 100 kVp between 252 (effective value recommended by the manufacturer) and 350 mAs (maximum effective value). In the entropy analysis of the image quality of three-dimensional CT angiograms, the mutual information (information gain) per lens dose was largest at 80 kVp and 252 mAs. Conclusion(s): Our results suggested that the suitable tube potentials for axial CT and three-dimensional CT angiograms were 100 and 80 kVp, respectively, and the effective milliampere-second value recommended by the manufacturer was appropriate. © 2012 The British Institute of Radiology.",Excluded
1771,"Detection of misery perfusion with split-dose <sup>123</sup>I-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with carotid occlusive diseases. Background and Purpose - Patients with carotid occlusive disease and stage 2 cerebral hemodynamic failure, characterized by an increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and otherwise known as misery perfusion, have a high risk of cerebral ischemia and subsequent stroke. In clinical practice, the detection of patients with misery perfusion through the use of widely available, noninvasive, and cost-effective modalities such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is extremely important. Methods - We evaluated the relationships between the regional hemodynamic status of cerebral circulation, measured with split-dose [<sup>123</sup>I] N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine SPECT (<sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT) and an acetazolamide challenge, and hemodynamic parameters, including OEF measured with PET, in 27 patients with both unilateral and bilateral carotid occlusive diseases. Results - A significant negative correlation was found between the SPECT-measured cerebrovascular reserve after acetazolamide administration and both the PET-measured OEF and cerebral blood volume. Neither the cerebrovascular reserve nor the cerebral blood flow index, when expressed as a SPECT-measured cerebrum-to-cerebellum ratio, was useful for detecting lesions with an elevated OEF. However, a combination of the cerebrovascular reserve and cerebral blood flow index showed high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the detection of misery perfusion. Conclusions - Our study suggests that split-dose <sup>123</sup>I-IMP SPECT with an acetazolamide challenge could be useful for screening patients with misery perfusion in carotid occlusive diseases.",Excluded
1772,"Perturbations of cell-cycle progression in gamma-irradiated ataxia telangiectasia and Huntington's disease cells detected by DNA flow cytometric analysis. The effects of ionizing radiation on cell-cycle progression in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and Huntington's disease (HD) patients, and from normal individuals, were studied using DNA flow cytometric analysis. A dose of 100 rad gamma irradiation blocked a proportion of normal and HD cells in G1. A higher radiation dose applied to normal cells increased the number of cells blocked in G1 and significantly delayed cells which were in S at the time of irradiation from reaching G2 DNA content. The reduced cumulative mitotic index in irradiated cultures of normal cells 2 h after irradiation suggests that cells in G2 at the time of irradiation are delayed before entering mitosis. After irradiation HD cells responded similarly to normal cells except that a greater proportion of HD cells were blocked in G1. AT cells do not show the normal delay in progression from G1 to S, or from S to G2 in the first cycle after irradiation. The cumulative mitotic index was reduced in irradiated cells, implying that they are delayed in G2. Thus AT cells did not recognize or respond to signals from damaged DNA which in normal and HD cells caused a proportional block in G1 and an S-phase delay. The only point of arrest in cell-cycle progression in irradiated AT cells was in G2.",Excluded
1773,"Chemical stimulation of rat retinal neurons: feasibility of an epiretinal neurotransmitter-based prosthesis. OBJECTIVE: No cure currently exists for photoreceptor degenerative diseases, which cause partial or total blindness in millions of people worldwide. Electrical retinal prostheses have been developed by several groups with the goal of restoring vision lost to these diseases, but electrical stimulation has limitations. It excites both somas and axons, activating retinal pathways nonphysiologically, and limits spatial resolution because of current spread. Chemical stimulation of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) using the neurotransmitter glutamate has been suggested as an alternative to electrical stimulation with some significant advantages. However, sufficient scientific data to support developing a chemical-based retinal prosthesis is lacking. The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a neurotransmitter-based retinal prosthesis and determine therapeutic stimulation parameters.APPROACH: We injected controlled amounts of glutamate into rat retinas from the epiretinal side ex vivo via micropipettes using a pressure injection system and recorded RGC responses with a multielectrode array. Responsive units were identified using a spike rate threshold of 3 Hz.MAIN RESULTS: We recorded both somal and axonal units and demonstrated successful glutamatergic stimulation across different RGC subtypes. Analyses show that exogenous glutamate acts on RGC synapses similar to endogenous glutamate and, unlike electrical prostheses, stimulates only RGC somata. The spatial spread of glutamate stimulation was = 290 mum from the injection site, comparable to current electrical prostheses. Further, the glutamate injections produced spatially differential responses in OFF, ON, and ON-OFF RGC subtypes, suggesting that differential stimulation of the OFF and ON systems may be possible. A temporal resolution of 3.2 Hz was obtained, which is a rate suitable for spatial vision.SIGNIFICANCE: We provide strong support for the feasibility of an epiretinal neurotransmitter-based retinal prosthesis. Our findings suggest that chemical stimulation of RGCs is a viable alternative to electrical stimulation and could offer distinct advantages such as the selective stimulation of RGC somata.",Excluded

1775,"Topiramate and cortical excitability in humans: a study with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered at 5 Hz frequency and suprathreshold intensity progressively increases the size of muscle evoked potentials (MEPs) and the duration of the cortical silent period (CSP) in normal subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of topiramate (TPM) at different doses on cortical excitability variables tested with rTMS. We tested the facilitation of the MEP size and CSP duration evoked by focal rTMS in eight patients before and after treatment with TPM at different doses for chronic neuropathic pain. In each patient, rTMS (5 Hz frequency-120% resting motor threshold) was applied at baseline and during the TPM induction phase (drug intake schedule: week I 25 mg/day, week II 50 mg/day, week III 75 mg/day, week IV 100 mg/day) and total TPM plasma concentrations were measured. The effects on the MEP size of 5 Hz-rTMS delivered over repeated sessions were tested in eight control subjects. TPM had no effect on the resting motor threshold. Antiepileptic treatment at increasing doses abolished the normal rTMS-induced MEP facilitation. ANOVA showed that this was a dose-related effect. Accordingly, in patients receiving TPM at higher doses (75 and 100 mg) rTMS failed to elicit the MEP facilitation. TPM left the progressive lengthening of the CSP during the rTMS train unchanged. In control subjects, rTMS applied over repeated sessions elicited a constant increase in MEP size. Our results suggest that TPM modulates the excitatory intracortical interneurons probably by altering rTMS-induced synaptic potentiation. These drug-induced effects are related to TPM doses and plasma concentrations. In conclusion, rTMS may be useful for quantifying the effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs and for assessing individual responses to different drugs but acting through similar mechanisms, thus combining functional neurophysiological information and laboratory data.",Excluded
1776,"Effect of exposure to radio frequency radiation emitted by cell phone on the developing dorsal root ganglion of chick embryo: a light microscopic study. With an ever increasing number of cell phone users since late twenty first century, magnitude of the problem of exposure to radiation emitted by cell phone is self evident. Extensive research had been devoted to incriminate or absolve it as a health hazard. Radiofrequency radiation emitted by cell phone had been stated to be a potent carcinogen, cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic and neurobehavioral teratogen. Its effect on the brain had been a subject of extensive research evidently due to its proximity to the user's brain. While considering the biological effects of radiofrequency radiation, its intensity, frequency and the duration of exposure are important determinants. Nevertheless the results of these different studies have not been unequivocal. Considering the contradictory reports, the present work was undertaken to study the effect of such an exposure on the developing neural tissue of chick embryo. The processes of cell division and differentiation are fundamental to the development of any living being and are a sensitive index of any insult sustained at this stage. Neurons of dorsal root ganglion were selected for the present study as these ganglia were fully differentiated as early as fourth day of embryonic life. By varying duration of exposure, the embryos were exposed to different doses of radiation, sacrificed at different periods of incubation and subjected to histological processing. On light microscopic study it was observed that developing neurons of dorsal root ganglion suffered a damage which was dose dependent and persisted in spite of giving the exposure-free period between two exposures.",Excluded

The interactions of mutant alleles that individually confer radiation sensitivity in Neurospora crassa are being studied with regard to their effects on radiation-induced inactivation and forward-mutation induction at the ad-3 loci. This paper reports attempts to construct 3 double-mutant strains containing the following pair-wise combinations of repair-deficient mutants: upr-1,uvs-2; uvs-2,uvs-6; and uvs-3,uvs-6. The double-mutant strain with the 2 excision-repair-deficient mutants upr-1 and uvs-2 shows increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced mutagenesis and inactivation, relative to that shown by either of the parental single-mutant strains. This double mutant is no more sensitive than the parental single-mutant strains to either UV mutagenesis or inactivation. The combination of the uvs-2 and uvs-6 double-mutant strain is considerably more sensitive to both UV and X-ray inactivation than either the uvs-2 or uvs-6 strain, but it shows no greater sensitivity than the parental strains to ad-3 mutation induction by either agent. The combination of the uvs-3 and uvs-6 alleles is inviable. Tetrad analysis and microscopical examination of ascospores shows that ascospores of presumptive genotype uvs-3, uvs-6 do not grow beyond the formation of a few hyphal threads. The lethal and mutagenic effects of UV and X-irradiation in these double-mutant strains are interpreted in terms of the repair systems in Neurospora and other microorganisms.",Excluded

At 37% survival, this mutant was approximately 5 times more sensitive to UV and also 6 times more sensitive to 4-NQO than the wild type. But it was only slightly sensitive to gamma-ray, MMS, MNNG, MTC and histidine. It showed an unusual photoreactivation response. Its time course of photorecovery was similar to the photoreactivation-defective strain upr-1 of Neurospora crassa. Mutation induction by UV at the ad-3 loci in this mutant strain was lower than that at the same loci in the wild-type strain. The uvs-(SA3B) mutant maps between met-1 and col-4 in linkage group IV, and it was not allelic with the mutagen-sensitive mutant mus-8 which is located in this area. We have concluded, therefore, that uvs-(SA3B) has resulted from mutation in a new DNA-repair gene. This new mutant was barren in homozygous crosses.",Excluded
1779,"A simpler method for total scalp irradiation: the multijaw-size concave arc technique. The lateral electron-photon technique (LEPT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are commonly used for total scalp irradiation. However, the treatment planning and irradiation are laborious and time-consuming. We herein present the multijaw-size concave arc technique (MCAT) as a total scalp irradiation method that overcomes these problems. CT datasets for eight patients previously treated for angiosarcoma of the scalp were replanned using MCAT, LEPT, and IMRT. The MCAT was designed with a dynamic conformal arc for the total scalp, with a multileaf collimator to shield the brain. Two additional conformal arcs with a decreased upper-jaw position of the first dynamic conformal arc were used to reduce the cranial hotspots. The prescribed dose was 40 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV, defined as the total scalp plus a 4 mm margin). MCAT was compared with LEPT and IMRT with respect to the PTV dose homogeneity (D5%-95%), underdosage (V < 90%), overdosage (V > 110%), doses to the brain, and the delivery time and monitor units (MUs) for single irradiation. We were able to formulate treatment plans for all three techniques that could deliver the prescription dose in all patients. MCAT was significantly superior to LEPT with respect to PTV dose homogeneity, overdosage, and underdosage, although MCAT was inferior to IMRT with respect to dose homogeneity and overdosage. The mean brain dose and high-dosage volume of all three techniques were low, but IMRT provided larger volume to the brain than did the other two techniques in the low dosage region. In MCAT, the mean delivery time could be reduced by approximately half or more, and the mean MUs could be reduced by at least 100 compared to the other two techniques. MCAT can achieve total scalp irradiation with substantially fewer MUs and a shorter delivery time than LEPT and IMRT.",Excluded
1780,"Re-evaluation of prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited-stage small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matched analysis. We attempted to re-evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) with more recent data. A total of 179 patients with LS-SCLC received radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy at our institution between 1998 and 2018. One hundred twenty-eight patients who achieved complete response (CR), good partial response (PR), and PR without progression for at least for one year after initial therapy were enrolled in this study. These patients were divided into a PCI group (group A, n=43), and a non-PCI group (group B, n=85). Survival outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. Because several background factors differed significantly between groups A and B, propensity score (PS) matching was performed as 1:1 match of the two groups. Finally, we analyzed 64 patients (group A/B=32/32). Median follow-up periods were 53 and 31 months in groups A and B, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups' backgrounds. Two-year overall survival (OS) rates were 77% in group A and 62% in group B (p=0.224). Two-year brain metastasis free survival (BMFS) rates were 85% in group A and 57% in group B (p=0.008). The number of patients who underwent a brain imaging test for confirmation of no brain metastasis (BM) after radical thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy (before PCI) was 84 (group A/B=32/52). A PS matched analysis for cases of pre-PCI brain imaging group, two-year OS rates for group A/B were 73/59% (p=0.446). Two-year BMFS rates for group A/B were 91/52% (p=0.021).

1781,"Experimental approaches to radiation-induced developmental abnormalities of the brain. The developing mammalian brain is highly susceptible to ionizing radiation. Significant increases in microcephalus, heterotopic cortical gray matter, and mental retardation have been noted in prenatally exposed survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the highest risk in those exposed during 8-15 weeks after fertilization. This stage corresponds to day 15 of pregnancy for rats and day 13 for mice in terms of brain development. The initial damage produced by radiation at this stage is cell death in the ventricular zone of the brain mantle, the radiosensitive germinal cell population. Disturbances in the production of neuronal germinal cells, and their migration to the cerebral cortex, give rise to malformations of the brain, such as microcephalus, an absent corpus callosum, disorganized cortical architecture, and heterotopic gray matter. Histological abnormalities are produced by about 500 mGy or more, and reduced brain weight is produced by 250 mGy or more. Mitotic delay, on the other hand, in the ventricular cells is caused by 100 mGy or more. A similar threshold level is suggested in human cases in the induction of mental retardation. The lowest doses of X- and gamma-radiation that induce detectable biological effects in rats and mice are around 30 mGy in increasing acute cell death.",Excluded

While reports suggest that HyperArc, a new stereotactic radiosurgery planning technique applied to non-coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique, is associated with high conformity and rapid dose fall-off, the performance of HyperArc for total scalp irradiation has not been explored. The current study aimed to compare the dosimetric performance of HyperArc plans with those of non-coplanar VMAT plans in angiosarcoma of the scalp.METHODS: Ten patients with angiosarcoma of the scalp were included in this study. The performance of three different plans administered using TrueBeam Edge were compared: non-coplanar VMAT using flattening filter (FF) beams (VMAT-FF), HyperArc using FF beams (HyperArc-FF), and HyperArc using flattening filter free (FFF) beams (HyperArc-FFF). The dose distribution, dosimetric parameters, and dosimetric accuracy for each of these plans were evaluated.RESULTS: The three plans showed no statistically significant differences in target volume coverage, conformity, and homogeneity. The HyperArc-FF and HyperArc-FFF plans provided significantly lower mean brain doses (12.63 +/- 3.31 Gy and 12.71 +/- 3.40 Gy) than did the VMAT-FF plans (17.11 +/- 5.25 Gy). There were almost no differences in sparing the organs at risk between the HyperArc-FF and HyperArc-FFF plans. The HyperArc-FF and HyperArc-FFF plans provided a shorter beam-on time than did the VMAT-FF plan. The 3%/2 mm gamma test pass rates were above 95% for all three plans.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the HyperArc plan can be potentially used for radiation therapy of target regions with large and complicated shapes, such as the scalp, and that there are no advantages of using FFF beams.",Excluded

Apart from being a neuropathy developed by the compression and irritation of piriformis muscle on the sciatic nerve, piriformis syndrome (PS) can also be caused by a trigger point without sciatic nerve involvement. Although it has been reported that PS could be seen in individuals at all activity levels, PS in patients who had spinal cord injury (SCI) has not been reported. In this study, a case of paraplegia, suffering from hip pain, who had been diagnosed and treated as PS was presented. A 62 years old woman complaining about pain and numbness in low back and right hip was admitted to our clinic. She was mobilized by crutches. From her anamnesis it was understood that she developed paraplegia after a fall two years ago. In her physical examination, she was diagnosed as ASIA: D T3 incomplete paraplegia. Her complaints had started 6 months ago after falling on her right hip. She had a severe pain with radicular radiation, during the deep palpation of the piriformis muscle. Compression of lumbar spinous processes were slightly painful. While FAIR, Pace, Beatty tests were positive on the right side, straight leg raising and the Laseque tests were both negative. For the purpose of diagnosis and treatment, 4 cc of 2% lidocaine+1 cc of betametazon dipropionate injection with a 22 G 88 mm Spinocan was done under the guidance of ultrasound into the piriformis muscle. The patient was diagnosed as PS as there was a significant relief of symptoms after the injection. When the risk factors that can cause PS were questioned, we learned that she had a habit of eating on the floor and sitting with her legs crossed.

An examination revealed a large tumor in his left nasal cavity; its surface was smooth and it bled easily. The patient did not have any visual acuity difficulties and the cervical lymph nodes were not swollen. A CT scan revealed a large tumor in his left nasal cavity and maxillary sinus which did not extend into the cranial space or eye socket. There were no bone defects. The patient underwent surgery for an olfactory neuroblastoma in June 1997. Based on the pathological findings, we made a diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma. The patient was treated with radiation therapy after surgical therapy. 45 Gy radiation therapy was added. The patient was followed up for 1 year and 6 months.

The cross-sectional areas and succinate dehydrogenase activities of L5 dorsal root ganglion neurons in rats were determined after 14 days of spaceflight and after nine days of recovery. The mean and distribution of the cross-sectional areas were similar to age-matched, ground-based controls for both the spaceflight and for the spaceflight plus recovery groups. The mean succinate dehydrogenase activity was significantly lower in spaceflight compared to aged-matched control rats, whereas the mean succinate dehydrogenase activity was similar in age-matched control and spaceflight plus recovery rats. The mean succinate dehydrogenase activity of neurons with cross-sectional areas between 1000 and 2000 microns2 was lower (between 7 and 10%) in both the spaceflight and the spaceflight plus recovery groups compared to the appropriate control groups. The reduction in the oxidative capacity of a subpopulation of sensory neurons having relatively large cross-sectional areas immediately following spaceflight and the sustained depression for nine days after returning to 1 g suggest that the 0 g environment induced significant alterations in proprioceptive function.",Included

Double mutants were constructed combining mus-26, formerly designated uvs-(SA3B), with other UV-sensitive mutants. Tests of sensitivity of these double mutants to UV and to chemical mutagens revealed that mus-26 and upr-1 belong to the same epistatic group. The UV dose-response curve of mus-26 showed a characteristic plateau in the range of 100-200 J/m2. The same characteristic was also shown in the dose-response curves of upr-1 and the double mutant, upr-1 mus-26. Photoreactivation of UV damage in mus-26, upr-1 and upr-1 mus-26 was defective but not null. Assays were made of the reversion rate of ad-8 in strains that also carried UV-sensitive mutations. The reversion frequencies of the strains with upr-1 and upr-1 mus-26 were very low for the UV dose range below 300 J/m2, similarly to mus-26. Previously reported homozygous sterility of mus-26 was not caused by the mus-26 locus itself, and fertile strains were obtained among progeny.

1792,"A new UV-sensitive mutant that suggests a second excision repair pathway in Neurospora crassa. In an attempt to understand the relationship between photorepair and dark repair in Neurospora crassa, a new mutant was isolated, which showed defects in both repair processes. The new mutant, mus-38, is moderately sensitive to UV and shows imperfect photoreactivation following UV irradiation. DNA was purified from this mutant and the other UV-sensitive mutants, and analyzed for the removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). UV-specific endonuclease-sensitive sites (ESS) completely disappeared with 1 h of photoreactivation in mus-38 DNA, although the survival recovery with photoreactivation was greatly reduced in this mutant. This suggests that the insufficient survival recovery with photoreactivation in mus-38 does not result from a failure of photo-reversal of CPDs. Removal of ESS during liquid holding (dark repair) was slower in mus-38 compared to wild type. To test the possibility that this mutant was involved in excision repair, the double mutant was made between mus-38 and mus-18, which encodes a UV-damage-specific endonuclease. CPD excision in the mus-18 null mutant was severely affected but not completely inhibited. The double mutant showed a complete loss of the excision activity and was super sensitive to UV. These results indicate that mus-38 participates in an excision pathway that is different from the mus-18 pathway. The mus-38 mutant was sensitive not only to UV but also to some chemical mutagens which make adducts on DNA. Thus, mus-38 is possibly involved in an excision-repair pathway that is related to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 pathway. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded

The standard first-line therapy for glioblastoma consists of maximal surgical resection, followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Optimal management for older glioblastoma patients is unknown as they have not been extensively studied in clinical trials. We report data from a series of 156 consecutive glioblastoma patients treated at our institution from 2007 to 2017. Compared to glioblastoma patients aged 70 or less, the patients older than 70 were less likely to undergo surgical resection (34% vs. 64%; p = 0.0003), be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (37% vs. 59%; p = 0.01) or radiation therapy (36% vs. 56%; p = 0.03). Disease-specific survival was significantly shorter in this age group (4.7 vs. 15.3 months; p = 0.002). Nonetheless, when older patients did undergo surgery or chemotherapy, the proportional improvement in cancer-specific survival was similar to the one recorded in younger patients, which is concordant with the findings of other published reports.

There is no consensus on the optimal management of these patients. The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of patients diagnosed with an incidental meningioma who were treated with surgery or radiotherapy. Method(s): Single-center retrospective cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with an incidental intracranial meningioma (2007-2015). Outcomes recorded were postintervention morbidity, histopathologic diagnosis, and treatment response. Result(s): Out of 441 patients, 44 underwent treatment. Median age at intervention was 56.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 49.6-66.5); patients included 35 women and 9 men. The main indication for imaging was headache (25.9%). Median meningioma volume was 4.55 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR, 1.91-8.61), and the commonest location was convexity (47.7%). Six patients underwent surgery at initial diagnosis. Thirty-eight had intervention (34 with surgery and 4 with radiotherapy) after a median active monitoring duration of 24 months (IQR, 11.8-42.0). Indications for treatment were radiologic progression (n = 26), symptom development (n = 6), and patient preference (n = 12). Pathology revealed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 meningioma in 36 patients and WHO grade 2 in 4 patients. The risk of postoperative surgical and medical morbidity requiring treatment was 25%. Early and late moderate adverse events limiting activities of daily living occurred in 28.6% of patients treated with radiotherapy. Recurrence rate after surgery was 2.5%. All meningiomas regressed or remained radiologically stable after radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): The morbidity after treatment of incidental intracranial meningioma is not negligible. Considering most operated tumors are WHO grade 1, treatment should be reserved for those manifesting symptoms or demonstrating substantial growth on radiologic surveillance.

Purpose: We report a very rare case showing menstrual restoration in severe pan-hypopituitarism many years after cranial irradiation for suprasellar germinoma.Case: A 30-year-old, almost primarily amenorrheic woman with severe panhypopituitarism presented with cyclic genital bleeding for the previous five months. She had menstruated once, when she was 13 years old. When she was 14 years old, she was diagnosed with a suprasellar germinoma measuring 10 mm in diameter, which led to diabetes insipidus. Cranial irradiation with a total dose of 24 Gy and chemotherapy resulted in complete tumor remission. She developed severe hypopituitarism [luteinizing hormone (LH) = 0.4 mIU/mL, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) = 1.7 mIU/mL, and serum estradiol (E2) level < 10 pg/mL]. She had received multiple hormone replacement therapies for many years. When she was 29 years old, she expressed a desire to become pregnant. Serum gonadotropin and E2 levels increased (LH = 5.8 mIU/mL, FSH = 5.9 mIU/mL, and E2 = 58 pg/mL). She conceived with clomiphene therapy, and then delivered a healthy baby. Eight months after parturition, her basal body temperature and serum progesterone levels indicated recovery of ovulatory cycles. Ten months after parturition, she also spontaneously conceived.Conclusion: Menstrual restoration is very rare in severe panhypopituitarism after cranial irradiation. A relatively low dose of irradiation and small tumor size may have contributed to the recovery of menstruation in our patient.",Excluded
1799,"Intraoperative ISO-C C-arm navigation surgery for spinal and pelvic trauma. Introduction: In patients with spinal or pelvic injuries caused by high-energy trauma, reconstructive surgery is performed so as to prevent complications and achieve early rehabilitation. Siremobil Iso- C3D (Siemens, Germany) is a mobile C-arm (Iso-C) that can reconstruct 3D images and allow surgeons to perform navigation surgery more accurately and quickly through the intraoperative evaluation of the 3D anatomy. Intraoperative use of fluoroscopy can therefore be reduced, minimizing radiation exposure to patients and medical staff. This report discusses the usefulness and safety of navigation surgery using Iso-C performed on patients with spinal or pelvic trauma. Subjects and methods: Two hundred and ninty patients with spinal or pelvic injuries who received instrumentation surgery using both Iso-C and a navigation system were recruited as subjects (131 with cervical spinal injuries, 126 with thoracolumbar spinal injuries, and 33 with pelvic trauma). All subjects received implants intraoperatively based on 3D images obtained using Iso-C. Screws used included the following: 1,435 pedicle (553 for the cervical spine and 882 for the thoracolumbar spine), 86 cervical lateral mass, 6 odontoid, 112 iliac, and 10 iliosacral. Accuracy of screw insertion was postoperatively evaluated with thin-slice CT (1.25 mm thickness). Grade 1 was assigned to screws that were correctly inserted within the bone cortex. Grade 2 was assigned to those where the screw thread penetrated through the bone cortex but where the deviation was less than 2 mm, while grade 3 was assigned to those for which the deviation was greater than 2 mm. Intraoperative radiation exposure time was also recorded. Result(s): No complications such as neurovascular damage were associated with surgery. Postoperative CT evaluation of the accuracy of screw insertion revealed that grades 2 and 3, were only observed with pedicle screws. For the cervical spine, 10 and 4 screws were defined as grades 2 and 3, respectively, while for the thoracolumbar spine, 22 and 7 were respectively categorized as grades 2 and 3. The rate of faulty insertions was 2.9% for pedicle screws. The average radiation exposure time needed to obtain intraoperative 3D images was 2.2 min. Discussion and conclusion: Reconstructive surgery for spinal or pelvic trauma is likely to be performed urgently and requires secure initial fixation. Computer navigation systems improve the accuracy of surgical procedures by functioning as surgeons' ''second eyes,'' and can be applied during urgent surgery. Moreover, these systems can reduce radiation exposure and thus increase the safety of patients and medical staff.",Excluded
1800,"[Evaluation of cerebral blood perfusion with IVR-CT/angio system during interventional procedures]. An interventional-radiology computed-tomography (IVR-CT)/angio system is a combination of an angiographic unit and a CT scanner. This system allows patient's movement in and out of the two imaging units, on the same table. Since June 2003, we have applied our conventional protocol for evaluation of cerebral blood perfusion during interventional radiology (IVR) procedures. We reviewed our experience using the IVR-CT/angio system and investigated the efficacy and limitations of this technique. No complications relating to radiation exposure, contrast medium use, or IVR procedures were observed. CT perfusion was useful for detecting cerebral perfusion impairment during IVR procedures. This was helpful in deciding the postoperative management. Because patients do not need to be transported to another radiographic suite to evaluate cerebral blood perfusion, the IVR-CT/angio system is ideal for safely and simply detecting cerebral perfusion defects during IVR procedures. However, it is important to consider whether there is sufficient indication for the procedure, because radiation exposure and the amount of contrast medium use are increased if the IVR procedures become difficult.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT angiography and perfusion imaging is an important prognostic tool in the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of advanced imaging in patients with SAH, incorporating the risks of radiation exposure from CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The risks of radiation-induced brain cancer and cataracts were incorporated into our established decision model comparing the cost-effectiveness of CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging and transcranial Doppler sonography in SAH. Cancer risk was calculated by using National Cancer Institute methodology. The remaining input probabilities were based on literature data and a cohort at our institution. Outcomes were expected quality-adjusted life years gained, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging were the dominant strategies, resulting in both better health outcomes and lower costs, even when incorporating brain cancer and cataract risks. Our results remained robust in 2-way sensitivity analyses varying the prolonged latency period up to 30 years, with either brain cancer risk up to 50 times higher than the upper 95% CI limit or the probability of cataracts from 0 to 1. Results were consistent for scenarios that considered either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with SAH. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed our findings over a broad range of selected input parameters.CONCLUSIONS: While risks of radiation exposure represent an important consideration, CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging remained the preferred imaging compared with transcranial Doppler sonography in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SAH, with improved health outcomes and lower health care costs, even when modeling a significantly higher risk and shorter latency period for both cataract and brain cancer than that currently known.",Excluded

Pharmacological agents that mediate a persistent GABAergic conductance are of considerable interest for treatment of epilepsy. (R)-roscovitine is a membrane permeable cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, designed to block cell division. It is currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial as an anticancer drug. We show that (R)-roscovitine increases a tonic GABA-mediated current in rat hippocampal neurons. This enhanced tonic current appears independent of synaptic GABA release and requires functional transmembrane GABA transport. The effect of (R)-roscovitine is associated with neither modification of GABAA receptors nor protein kinase activity, but is associated with a significant increase in intracellular GABA concentration in hippocampal GABAergic neurons. (R)-roscovitine-induced tonic inhibition significantly suppresses spontaneous spiking activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Therefore, (R)-roscovitine is a potent modulator of neuronal activity in rat hippocampus and may provide a tool for preventing paroxysmal activity.",Excluded

1806,"GBM And Radiation: The Double-Edged Sword Effects Of Cannabis. Purpose/Objective(s): Recent preclinical studies show that cannabidiol (CBD) at clinically relevant doses of 5-20 uM protects normal neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC) and fetal astrocytes from ionizing radiation while directly killing GBM cells. The precise mechanisms for these double-edged sword effects of CBD are unknown. The overall hypothesis of the present study is that CBD, by targeting the numerous signaling pathways (including those that are highly active in GBM), induces an imbalance between cell killing and cell survival mechanisms in cancer cells while demonstrating protective effects on the survival of normal neuronal cells. Materials/Methods: Human GBM cell lines (U87MG, T98G and TS543) and NSC were used as regular 2D or 3D spheroid/neurosphere cultures. Levels of autophagy were examined using LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and confirmed by immunofluorescence staining levels of SQSTM1/p62. Chloroquine (10-50 uM) was used as an inhibitor of autophagic flux. Apoptosis and necrosis were determined using Annexin-V-FITC plus Propidium Iodide staining. Levels of signaling proteins (active versus total) were detected using Western blot analysis and corresponding antibodies. Data were analyzed using the Standard t-test. Result(s): Blockage of autophagy in CBD-treated 3D tumor cultures upregulated radiation-induced cell death only modestly. CBD enhanced the pro-apoptotic activities of JNK1/2 and MAPK p38 signaling cascades by more than 3-fold while partially downregulated the pro-survival PI3K-AKT cascade, thereby enhancing the efficacy of radiation treatment of tumor cells. Co-treatment of CBD-targeted cells with inhibitors of pro-survival and inflammatory pathways effectively killed surviving GBM cells in both 2D and 3D cultures. In contrast, CBD, even at high doses (20 mM), did not induce apoptosis in NSC, but promoted their differentiation into young neurons and glial cells. Conclusion(s): Cannabidiol has both a strong apoptotic and a modest autophagic signaling pathway as shown in several GBM models. Studies to elucidate how these two contrasting pathways may be safely and optimally modulated in CBD treatment of GBM (using 3D cultures and mini-tumor models) are ongoing.

We studied cytotoxic effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon beams on glioma cell lines with either mutant or wild-type p53.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cell lines U-87 and U-138 expressing wild-type p53 and U-251 and U-373 expressing mutant p53 were used. These cells were irradiated with 290 MeV/u carbon beams generated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in the National Institute of Radiologic Science or X-rays. A standard colony-forming assay and flow cytometric detection of apoptosis were performed. Cell cycle progression and the expression of p53, p21, and bax proteins were examined.RESULTS: High LET carbon radiation was more cytotoxic than low LET X-ray treatment against glioma cells. The effects of the carbon beams were not dependent on the p53 gene status but were reduced by G(1) arrest, which was independent of p21 expression. The expression of bax remained unchanged in all four cell lines.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that high LET charged particle radiation can induce cell death in glioma cells more effectively than X-rays and that cell death other than p53-dependent apoptosis may participate in the cytotoxicity of heavy charged particles.

Brain metastases from luminal A and B types of breast cancer arose more often in the cerebellum. Brain metastases from HER2-positive type breast cancer occurred more often in the putamen and the thalamus and less frequently in the cerebellum than other types (P=0.0057). The subtypes of breast cancer are related to differences in the spatial distributions of their brain metastases.

A suite of ten explanatory variables (altitude, slope, aspect, land use, rainfall, soil order, temperature, wind effect, and distance to roads and human settlements) was investigated and a spatial database constructed using 32 fire events from the Zagros ecoregion (Iran). The frequency ratio model was used to assign weights to each class of variables that depended on the strength of the spatial association between each class and the probability of wildfire occurrence. The weights were then used for training the ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-FA hybrid models. The models were validated using the ROC-AUC method that indicated that the ANFIS-GA model performed better (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.92; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.91) than the ANFIS-FA model (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.89; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.88). The efficiency of these models was compared to a single ANFIS model and statistical analyses of paired comparisons revealed that the two meta-optimized predictive models significantly improved wildfire prediction accuracy compared to the single ANFIS model (AUC<inf>success</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.82; AUC<inf>prediction</inf> <inf>rate</inf> = 0.78). We concluded that such predictive models may become valuable toolkits to effectively guide fire management plans and on-the-ground decisions on firefighting strategies.

1817,"Tumor treating fields: A novel therapy for glioblastoma multiforme. Learning Objectives: To describe the rationale, indications, and literature supporting the use of Tumor Treating Fields in the first-line and second-line settings for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Main: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a novel anti-neoplastic treatment recently approved for clinical use for GBM. This new modality utilizes low intensity, intermediate frequency alternating electrical fields that have demonstrated anti-neoplastic efficacy in pre-clinical studies. The mechanism of action is postulated to include mitotic disruption at various points including dipole misalignment, impaired microtubule assembly, dielectrophoresis of intra-cellular molecules and organelle disruption, and asymmetric chromosome segregation. TTfields is delivered continuously to the brain by a patient-operated, wearable medical device (OptuneTM, Novocure Ltd.). A large (695 patients enrolled), international, randomized, phase 3 trial has recently confirmed the long-term efficacy of adding TTFields to standard maintenance chemotherapy after the completion of chemo-irradiation in newly diagnosed GBM. At 5-year follow-up, this trial demonstrated consistent superior tumor control (median PFS 6.7 vs. 4.0 months, p = 0.00005) and significantly improved survival (median OS 20.9 vs. 16 months, 5-year OS 13% vs. 5%, p = 0.00006) with the addition of TTFields to the current standard of care therapy. The magnitude of improvement when adding TTFields is comparable to the benefit observed with adding chemotherapy to radiation (demonstrated over a decade ago). There was no significant toxicity observed with TTfields (most commonly, mild dermatitis), and patient-reported quality of life was unaffected. On subset analysis, both MGMT hypermethylation-positive and negative tumor subtypes were found to significantly benefit from TTF. In the second-line setting, a prior phase III trial has demonstrated equal efficacy but improved toxicity and quality of life profiles as compared to physician's choice of 2nd-line chemotherapy in GBM progressing after standard therapy. TTF is now endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for both the 1st line and 2nd-line setting in the treatment of GBM.",Excluded
1818,"Clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of CT-angiography in the diagnosis of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. INTRODUCTION: CT-angiography gains an increasing role in the initial diagnosis of patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, the implementation of CT-angiography does not always exclude the necessity of conventional angiography. Our objective was to determine the practical utility and cost-effectiveness of CT-angiography.METHODS: All patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted to our university hospital after implementation of CT-angiography between June 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012 were retrospectively analyzed in regard to factors of treatment flow, radiation exposure, harms of contrast medium loading, and diagnostic costs. A control group of the same size was assembled from previously admitted SAH patients, who did not undergo pretreatment CT-angiography. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analysis was performed.RESULTS: The final analysis consisted of 93 patients in each group. Of 93 patients with pretreatment CT-angiography, 74 had to undergo conventional angiography for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. CT-angiography had significant impact on the reduction of collective effective radiation dose by 4.419 mSv per person (p = 0.0002) and was not associated with additional harms. Despite the significantly earlier detection of aneurysms with CT-angiography (p < 0.0001), there were no significant differences in the timing of aneurysm repair and duration of ICU and general hospital stay. There was an increase of diagnostic costs-the cost-effectiveness analysis showed, however, that benefits of CT-angiography in respect to radiation exposure and risk of conventional angiography-related complications justify the additional costs of CT-angiography.CONCLUSIONS: Although the implementation of CT-angiography in SAH diagnosis cannot completely replace conventional angiography, it can be approved in regard to radiation hygiene and cost-effectiveness.",Excluded
1819,"Hypofractionated radiation therapy and temozolomide in patients with glioblastoma and poor prognostic factors. A prospective, single-institution experience. BACKGROUND: Hypofractionated radiation therapy is a feasible and safe treatment option in elderly and frail patients with glioblastoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of hypofractionated radiation therapy with concurrent temozolomide in terms of feasibility and disease control in primary glioblastoma patients with poor prognostic factors other than advanced age, such as post-surgical neurological complications, high tumor burden, unresectable or multifocal lesions, and potential low treatment compliance due to social factors or rapidly progressive disease.MATERIAL AND METHODS: GTV included the surgical cavity plus disease visible in T1WI-MRI, FLAIR-MRI and in the MET-uptake. The CTV was defined as the GTV plus 1.5-2 cm margin; the PTV was the CTV+0.3 cm margin. Forty, fourty-five, and fifty grays in 15 fractions were prescribed to 95% of PTV, CTV, and GTV, respectively. Treatment was delivered using IMRT or the VMAT technique. Simultaneously, 75 mg/m2/day of temozolomide were administered.RESULTS: Between January 2010 and November 2017, we treated a total of 17 patients. The median age at diagnosis was 68-years; median KPS was 50-70%. MGMT-methylation status was negative in 5 patients, and 8 patients were IDH-wildtype. Eight of 18 patients were younger than 65-years. Median tumor volume was 26.95cc; median PTV volume was 322cc. Four lesions were unresectable; 6 patients underwent complete surgical resection. Median residual volume was 1.14cc. Progression-free survival was 60% at 6 months, 33% at 1-year and 13% at 2-years (median OS = 7 months). No acute grade 3-5 toxicities were documented. Symptomatic grade 3 radiation necrosis was observed in one patient.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with poor clinical factors other than advanced age can be selected for hypofractionated radiotherapy. The OS and PFS rates obtained in our series are similar to those in patients treated with standard fractionation, assuring good treatment adherence, low rates of toxicity and probable improved cost-effectiveness.",Excluded
1820,"A prospective phase II trial of lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( LEN-DEX) in POEMS syndrome. Background. POEMS syndrome is a rare form of B cell dyscrasia combining a proliferation usually of plasma cells, a polyneuropathy, osteocondensing bone lesions and multiple other clinical signs. The pathogenesis is not well understood but VEGF plays a major role. In patients with one or two sclerotic plasmacytoma and no bone marrow involvement, first line therapy should include radiation. For patients with diffuse sclerotic lesions, bone marrow involvement or absence of any bone lesion and for those who have not demonstrated stabilization of their disease 3 to 6 months after completing radiation systemic therapy is indicated, the most effective being high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Radiation of a single lesion is effective in about every other case and is accompanied by a fairly slow improvement of the neurological symptoms, often after initial worsening. ASCT seems to be accompanied by a number of important complications, in particular engraftment syndrome. Outside these 2 treatments there is no consensus therapy. Lenalidomide (LEN), a drug without serious neurological toxicity, has the advantage of being both anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic to malignant plasma cells (Richardson PG, Blood 2002;100(9):3063-7). We have recently reported a series of 20 French patients with POEMS syndrome treated by LEN with a good efficacy. We now report the first 27 patients of a prospective phase II trial using LEN + dexamethasone (LEN-DEX), 2 cycles preceding radiation or high dose treatment trying to obtain a rapid clinical response and to avoid engraftment syndrome or 9 cycles followed by 1 year LENalone in patients who cannot receive radiation or ASCT. Methods. Newly diagnosed or relapsing patients with POEMS syndrome who needed to be treated were eligible. Patients who can be treated by local radiation or intensive treatment with stem cell support receive two 28 day cycles of LEN 25 mg PO Days 1-21 and DEX 40 mg PO Days 1,8,15,22 before radiation or intensive treatment (Group 1), the other patients receive 9 cycles of the same LEN-DEX (Group 2) and then 12 cycles of continuous low dose LEN (10 mg). LEN dose was tapered to 10 mg for patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 ml/min and DEX to 20 mg for patients above 75 years of age and for those who were frail patients. Main eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome according to criteria by Dispenzieri et al (Am J Hematol 2012;87(8):804-14), an age of 18 or more, a creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min, no prior treatment with or contraindication to LEN and no uncontrolled thrombosis. Serum and plasma VEGF, serum electrophoresis, immunofixation and free light chain measurements were centrally monitored. Neurologic evaluations were performed using the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS), the Neurological Impairment Scale (NIS) and the 10 meter walk test (10MWT). The primary endpoint was evaluation of the effectiveness of LEN-DEX combination using biological responses (decrease of monoclonal protein and serum VEGF level) and secondary endpoints were clinical and particularly neurological responses. Results. Twenty-seven patients have been included in 12 centres, median age was 61 (range 32-75), the median follow-up was 6.6 months (range 2-24). Eighteen patients were in group 1, with radiotherapy in 10 patients and ASCT in 8 patients; 9 patients were in group 2. Nineteen patients were in first line and 8 already treated. Only 2 patients experienced grade 3-4 adverse events due to LEN (cytopenia) and 2 patients had allergic rashes, no thrombotic event occurred. No engraftment syndrome was noted in the 5 patients already treated with ASCT. To date, no patient have died. Evolution of VEGF median values in serum and plasma, M-spike and dFLC levels and evolution of neurological measurements are reported in table 1. Neurological improvement was very rapid in some patients, using ONLS and 10MWT 11/18 evaluable patients had a neurological improvement after 2 cycles with an improvement of 1 or more of the ONLS score an /or change of 0.1 m/s or more in the 10MWT. Only one patient who progressed after nine cycles received another therapy. Conclusion. This is the first prospective trial of LEN-DEX in POEMS syndrome. This combination seems well tolerated in this disease with a good efficacy on VEGF measurements and rapid neurological improvement in the majority of patients. Updated data will be presented at the meeting. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
1821,"Role of gamma knife therapy in the management of pituitary tumors. 1. Gamma knife therapy is an effective method of delivering radiation to pituitary tumors that have failed surgery and may be used as primary treatment in circumstances in which the patient refuses or is unsuitable for a transsphenoidal procedure. 2. Stereotactic radiosurgery with the gamma knife unit is generally administered in a single session unlike fractionated radiotherapy, which is administered four to five times per week over a 6-week period. 3. Preliminary data suggest that resolution of pituitary hypersecretion is faster with gamma knife therapy than with conventional radiotherapy. 4. Because of the nature of the gamma knife therapy and the fact that the radiation dose conforms to the tumor shape, there is a steep fall-off of radiation to surrounding tissue. Accordingly, the radiation dose to extrapituitary brain is substantially less with gamma knife radiosurgery than with conventional radiotherapy. This suggests that the development of second brain tumors and neurocognitive complications, which are significant risks with conventional radiotherapy, is much less likely with gamma knife surgery. 5. Gamma knife radiosurgery can be used to ablate tumors invading the cavernous sinus. 6. Gamma knife radiosurgery is safe as long as the dose of radiation to the optic structures is kept under 10 Gy. 7. Long-term follow-up is required for pituitary tumors treated by gamma knife therapy so as to determine its efficacy as well as its effects on pituitary function and any resultant complications.

1822,"Equivalent outcomes with hypofractionated, accelerated thoracic radiation therapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Does this represent a reasonable strategy in patients unable to attend twice daily treatment?. Purpose/Objective(s): The publication of RTOG 8815 established hyperfractionated, twice-daily thoracic radiation therapy (BID RT) with concurrent platinum-etoposide (PE) as the standard of care in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). However, many patients with this aggressive, often debilitating malignancy find BID RT intolerable due to both physical and logistical limitations. As an alternative, patients unable to receive BID RT are treated with daily 3Gy fractions (QD RT) to a total dose of 45Gy at our institution.We hypothesized that hypofractionated QD RT in the setting of concurrent PE would be as safe and effective as BID RT. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with LS-SCLC treated with curative intent. Patients received 45Gy either QD (3Gy) or BID (1.5Gy) with concurrent PE. Covariables reviewed include age, gender, race, insurance status, year of diagnosis, 3D vs IMRT planning, PTV volume, chemotherapy agents and cycles, RT dose and fractionation, incidence of Grade >=2 radiation pneumonitis and subsequent delivery of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were utilized to compare the characteristics of treatment groups for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) estimates were generated, with accompanying univariate (UVA) log-rank and multivariate (MVA) Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Result(s): Thirty-six patients were evaluable, with a median follow-up of 13 months for the entire cohort (range 3-79), and a median follow-up of 18.5 months for survivors (range 7-73). 88% of patients were deceased at last follow-up. For the entire cohort, median age was 63 years (range 54-81). 24 (67%) patients received BID RT; 12 (33%) received QD RT. BID and QD groups were balanced with respect to age, race, sex, insurance status, PTV volume, and 3D vs IMRT planning. One patient in each group was treated with corticosteroids for radiation pneumonitis. No significant differences were observed for PFS or OS outcomes. 2-year PFS was 13.4% (BID) vs 16.7% (QD) (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-1.67; p<.61) and 2-year OS was 34.5% (BID) vs 31.7% (QD) (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.28-1.86; p<.51). Neither the incidence of Grade >= 2 radiation pneumonitis (p=0.61) nor utilization of PCI (BID 58% vs 50% QD, p=0.64) differed between the two groups. Conclusion(s): In this single-institution study, hypofractionated QD RT to 45Gy delivered with concurrent PE was associated with toxicity and outcomes comparable to BID RT with concurrent PE. Further validation with a larger, prospective dataset is warranted. Daily hypofractionated thoracic RT with concurrent chemotherapy represents a reasonable alternative for patients who cannot be treated twice daily.",Excluded
1823,"In vivo and in vitro demonstration of reduced myelin synthesis following early postnatal exposure to ionizing radiation in the rat. Irradiation of the immature central nervous system has been demonstrated histopathologically to result in a reduction in the quantity of myelin seen at later developmental ages [S. A. Gilmore, J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 22, 294-301 (1963). J. A. Beal and J. L. Hall, J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 33, 128-143 (1974)]. The results from our investigation indicate that this reduction in myelin content can be attributed to a decrease in sulfatide synthesis. Rats received whole-brain irradiation with 0, 500, 1500, 2000, or 2500 rad at 4 days postnatal (dpn). All of the rats exposed to 2000 or 2500 rad and 70% of those exposed to 1500 rad died within 6 to 10 days. At 17 dpn, animals received single intraperitoneal injections of [35S]sodium sulfate. Myelin synthesis, as indexed by the incorporation of sulfate into total lipids and glycolipids, was reduced in a dose-related fashion. To demonstrate a direct effect of ionizing radiation on myelinogenesis, brain cell reaggregate cultures derived from fetal rats were exposed at 12 days in vitro (div) to 0, 250, 500, 1000, or 1500 rad. A dose-related reduction in [35S]sulfate incorporation through 21 div was demonstrated. Reaggregates exposed to 250 or 500 rad but not 1000 or 1500 rad resumed normal myelin synthesis by 28 div. These changes occurred in the absence of histopathological changes, changes in protein content, and changes in the rate of protein synthesis.",Excluded
1824,"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. [German]. Hyperbaric oxygenation is defined as the administration of 100% oxygen in a compression chamber at an ambient pressure greater than one atmosphere absolute. The increased pressure (up to three atmospheres) induces a 10- to 15-fold plasma oxygen concentration resulting in increased tissue oxygenation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves the bactericidal capacity of leukocytes, stimulates important mechanisms in wound healing, reduces tissue oedema and maintains tissue oxygenation even in the absence of haemoglobin. Commonly accepted indications supported by scientific evidence include the decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, severe carbon monoxide poisoning, delayed radiation injury, clostridial myonecrosis and also the improvement of healing of vulnerable skin or soft tissue grafts. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is also used in healing difficulties of specific problem wounds, extreme blood loss, intracranial abscesses, necrotizing soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, crush syndrome, burns and sudden deafness. Since hyperbaric oxygenation involves the administration of oxygen in a pharmacological dose, side effects are possible due to barotrauma and oxygen toxicity. During hyperbaric oxygen therapy, an increased amount of oxygen-free radicals may be generated, depending on the duration and extent of pressure elevation during treatment. Although many different organ systems may be affected, the brain is of greatest clinical significance. Neurotoxicity is manifested by visual disturbances, auditory hallucinations, nausea, facial twitching, irritability, dizziness and convulsion.",Excluded
1825,"Clinical and pathological characteristics of brain metastasis resected after failed radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the tumor histopathology and clinical characteristics of patients who underwent resection of their brain metastasis after failed gamma knife radiosurgery.METHODS: This study was a retrospective review from a prospective database. A total of 1200 brain metastases in 912 patients were treated by gamma knife radiosurgery during a 7-year period. Fifteen patients (1.6% of patients, 1.2% of all brain metastases) underwent resective surgery for either presumed tumor progression (6 patients) or worsening neurological symptoms associated with increased mass effect (9 patients). Radiographic imaging, radiosurgical and surgical treatment parameters, histopathological findings, and long-term outcomes were reviewed for all patients.RESULTS: The mean age at the time of radiosurgery was 57 years (age range, 32-65 years). Initial pathological diagnoses included metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma in 8 patients (53%), melanoma in 4 patients (27%), renal cell carcinoma in 2 patients (13%), and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in 1 patient (7%). The mean time interval between radiosurgery and surgical extirpation was 8.5 months (range, 3 weeks to 34 months). The mean treatment volume for the resected lesion at the time of radiosurgery was 4.4 cm(3) (range, 0.6-8.4 cm(3)). The mean dose to the tumor margin was 21Gy (range, 18-24 Gy). In addition to the 15 tumors that were eventually resected, a total of 32 other metastases were treated synchronously, with a 78% control rate. The mean volume immediately before surgery for the 15 resected lesions was 7.5 cm(3) (range, 3.8-10.2 cm(3)). Histological findings after radiosurgery varied from case to case and included viable tumor, necrotic tumor, vascular hyalinization, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, reactive gliosis in surrounding brain tissue, and an elevated MIB-1 proliferation index in cases with viable tumor. The mean survival for patients in whom viable tumor was identified (9.4 months) was significantly lower than that of patients in whom only necrosis was seen (15.1 months; Fisher's exact test, P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Radiation necrosis and tumor radioresistance are the most common causes precipitating a need for surgical resection after radiosurgery in patients with brain metastasis.",Excluded

Drug-radiation multimodal chemotherapy for malignant brain tumor cells was stimulated in vitro by a recently developed computer program, based on evaluation of 3D-response surfaces and interaction isoboles. Three malignant glioma tumor cell cultures (HTZ17, 146 and 209 B) were sequentially treated in vitro by increasing doses of 4-hydroperoxy-ifosfamide, according to in vivo/in vitro pharmacokinetic correlation (0.01 to 10 microM), and increasing single doses of Gamma-radiation (clinical60Co-radiotherapy unit, 0.26 to 4 Gy or 1 to 3.38 Gy, respectively). After approximately five population doubling times with standard tissue culture conditions, 3H-Tdr-incorporation was determined by a liquid scintillation counting protocol. Data points were evaluated for mono- and combined treatment dose-effects. A model-free 3D-response surface was created and compared to the theoretical additive response surface. Local additivity was analysed for any desired ratio of combined treatment as well as for isoboles. No significant sub- or supraadditive effects were observed, indicating additive effects in all 3 tumors. No sequence dependence of effects could be demonstrated. In case radiotherapy and ifosfamide-chemotherapy are active treatment modalities and additive effects are found, we conclude that the combination of ifosfamide and radiotherapy might be attractive for the treatment of malignant brain tumors and should be further studied.",Excluded

The radioprotective property of 50 mg/kg body weight jamun (Syzygium cumini) extract was studied in the cultured splenocytes of mice exposed to 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 Gy of gamma-radiation. The spleens of irradiated mice were removed aseptically and the splenocytes were extracted from the individual spleens and cultured. The micronuclei were prepared 72 hours after irradiation in binucleate splenocytes by blocking cytokinesis with cytochalasin-B. Irradiation of mice resulted in a dose-dependent elevation in the micronucleated splenocytes. The exposure of mice not only elevated splenocytes bearing one micronucleus but also cells bearing 2 and multiple (>2) micronuclei indicating induction of complex DNA damage after irradiation. Oral treatment of mice with 50 mg/kg body weight of jamun leaf extract protected against the radiation-induced micronuclei formation. Jamun extract also protected against the formation of 2 and multiple micronuclei indicating repair or inhibition of complex DNA damage. The assessment of lipid peroxidation in mice brain homogenate has indicated a concentration dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation by jamun extract. Studies in a cell free system revealed that jamun extract inhibited the formation of OH, O(2)-, DPPH, and ABTS(+) free radicals in a concentration dependent manner. Our study demonstrates that jamun extract protected mice against the radiation-induced DNA damage and inhibition of radiation-induced free radical formation may be one of the mechanisms of radioprotection.",Included
1828,"Toward Improving Patients' Experiences of Acute Toxicity From Breast Radiotherapy: Insights From the Analysis of Patient-Reported Outcomes in a Large Multicenter Cohort. PURPOSE: Understanding acute toxicities after whole-breast radiotherapy is important to inform patients, guide treatment decisions, and target supportive care. We evaluated patient-reported outcomes prospectively collected from a cohort of patients with breast cancer.METHODS: We describe the maximal toxicity reported by 8,711 patients treated between 2012 and 2019 at 27 practices. Multivariable models identified characteristics associated with (1) breast pain, (2) bother from itching, stinging/burning, swelling, or hurting of the treated breast, and (3) fatigue within 7 days of completing whole-breast radiotherapy.RESULTS: Moderate or severe breast pain was reported by 3,233 (37.1%): 1,282 (28.9%) of those receiving hypofractionation and 1,951 (45.7%) of those receiving conventional fractionation. Frequent bother from at least one breast symptom was reported by 4,424 (50.8%): 1,833 (41.3%) after hypofractionation and 2,591 (60.7%) after conventional fractionation. Severe fatigue was reported by 2,008 (23.1%): 843 (19.0%) after hypofractionation and 1,165 (27.3%) after conventional fractionation. Among patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy, younger age (P < .001), higher body mass index (BMI; P < .001), Black (P < .001) or other race (P = .002), smoking status (P < .001), larger breast volume (P = .002), lack of chemotherapy receipt (P = .004), receipt of boost treatment (P < .001), and treatment at a nonteaching center predicted breast pain. Among patients receiving conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, younger age (P < .001), higher BMI (P = .003), Black (P < .001) or other race (P = .002), diabetes (P = .001), smoking status (P < .001), and larger breast volume (P < .001) predicted breast pain.CONCLUSION: In this large observational data set, substantial differences existed according to radiotherapy dose fractionation. Race-related differences in pain existed despite controlling for multiple other factors; additional research is needed to understand what drives these differences to target potentially modifiable factors. Intensifying supportive care may be appropriate for subgroups identified as being vulnerable to greater toxicity.",Excluded

Surgical treatment is a real challenge because this area is occupied by several critical neurovascular elements. Currently, surgery is the first choice of treatment, however several factors may be present that necessitate choosing the alternative treatments such as Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with CPA meningioma who were treated by GKS for a period of 8 years, were retrospectively reviewed. Factors affecting clinical and radiological improvement were analyzed.RESULTS: The median tumor volume was 6cm<sup>3</sup>. The mean values for maximal and marginal dose were 20.2 and 13.6Gy, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 31.5 months. Tumor control (lack of progression) was achieved in 96.8% of the patients and 55.9% of the patients showed tumor regression on follow-up MRI. The actuarial 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 96%. Clinical improvement was seen in 49.5% of the patients while 11.8% experienced worsening or new-onset symptoms. Adverse radiation effects were seen in 4.3% of the patients. A worse symptomatic outcome, male sex, a lower tumor coverage, and marginal doses <13.5Gy were associated with worse radiologic outcomes. Worse radiologic outcomes and higher tumor volumes, especially tumor volumes >=8.5cc, were associated with worse symptomatic outcomes. The male sex was associated with a lower PFS.CONCLUSION: Gamma Knife radiosurgery, either primarily or post- operatively, offers a decent long-term tumor control in CPA meningioma, and is associated with an acceptable complication profile, especially in tumors with lower volumes.",Excluded

Method(s): Nineteen patients harboring twenty-two brain metastases treated with SRS were imaged with dynamic susceptibility magnetic resonance imaging (DSC MRI) at baseline, 1 week and 1 month post SRS. Relative cerebral blood volume and flow (rCBV and rCBF) ratios were evaluated outside of tumor within a combined region of interest (ROI) and separately within gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) ROIs. Threedimensional dose distribution from each SRS plan was divided into six regions: (1) <2 Gy; (2) 2-5 Gy; (3) 5-10 Gy; (4) 10-12 Gy; (5) 12-16 Gy; and (6) >16 Gy. rCBV and rCBF ratio differences between baseline, 1 week and 1 month were compared. Best linear fit plots quantified normal tissue dose-dependency. Result(s): Significant rCBV ratio increases were present between baseline and 1 month for all ROIs and dose ranges except for WM ROI receiving <2 Gy. rCBV ratio for all ROIs was maximally increased from baseline to 1 month with the greatest changes occurring within the 5-10 Gy dose range (53.1%). rCBF ratio was maximally increased from baseline to 1 month for all ROIs within the 5-10 Gy dose range (33.9-45.0%). Both rCBV and rCBF ratios were most elevated within GM ROIs. A weak, positive but not significant association between dose, rCBV and rCBF ratio was demonstrated. Progressive rCBV and rCBF ratio increased with dose up to 10 Gy at 1 month. Conclusion(s): Normal tissue response following SRS can be characterized by dose, tissue, and time specific increases in rCBV and rCBF ratio. Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.",Excluded
1832,"Control of rat hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons by a circadian clock that is entrained by the daily light-off signal. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that the immediate-early gene, c-fos can regulate, through its protein product Fos, the expression of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene. In the present study, immunohistochemistry for Fos and beta-endorphin was used to assess the basal activity of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin-producing neurons throughout a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Here, we showed that Fos is undetectable in most beta-endorphin neurons from late morning until 30 min after light offset in the evening, whereas Fos is spontaneously expressed in these neurons after 1 h following dark onset. The number of beta-endorphin neurons expressing Fos increases continuously during the first half of the dark phase, is maximal at the middle of this phase and decreases through late night and early morning, reaching a nadir 2-3 h after light onset. Acute shifts of lighting parameters allowed us to demonstrate that the light-off signal per se is neither sufficient nor necessary for Fos expression in beta-endorphin neurons. However, when recurrent, this signal is able to entrain Fos expression after a period of adaptation to the new light/dark schedule. Moreover, an expression of Fos in beta-endorphin neurons persists during subjective night in rat exposed to constant light or constant dark for two to three days. Thus, the occurrence of the daily rhythmic increase in the expression of Fos protein in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons exclusively at (subjective) night suggests that these neurons are, most likely, controlled by a (circadian) nocturnal oscillator. Our data also reveal an interesting property of this oscillator: its entrainment by the daily light-to-dark transition signal.",Excluded

1834,"Analysis of occupational radiation exposure during cerebral angiography utilizing a new real time radiation dose monitoring system. BACKGROUND: Thermoluminescent dosimeter badges currently utilized to monitor occupational radiation exposures are limited in their ability to provide timely feedback, restricting workers' ability to identify unnecessary exposure. New real time radiation monitoring systems provide an opportunity for workers to immediately identify and alter problematic behaviors in the neuroangiography suite, decreasing unnecessary exposures, lowering risk, and maximizing safety efforts.METHODS: Real time radiation monitoring was performed for 120 diagnostic cerebral angiography procedures. Data were collected in two phases, for procedures performed by two physician participants (30 procedures per physician per phase). Workers were blinded to their real time dose in phase I, and unblinded in phase II. Individual exposures (Sv) and the incidence of red events (exposure rates >=2.0 mSv/h) were collected for each assigned participating role (physician A, physician B, nurse, scrubbed technologist, and circulating technologist). The dose area product was collected for each procedure to standardize against variations in procedure duration or intensity.RESULTS: In phase II, significant decreased radiation exposure was observed for all roles except physician A. Physician B decreased most from 24.3x10(-8) to 6.9x10(-8) Sv/Gy-cm(2) (p<0.0001). Rates of red events decreased similarly for all roles except physician A, and were significant for all roles except the nurse role.CONCLUSIONS: Real time radiation dose monitoring during diagnostic cerebral angiography may help to reduce occupational radiation exposures for healthcare workers.",Excluded
1835,"Dose Assessment in Computed Tomography Examination and Establishment of Local Diagnostic Reference Levels in Mazandaran, Iran. BACKGROUND: Medical X-rays are the largest man-made source of public exposure to ionizing radiation. While the benefits of Computed Tomography (CT) are well known in accurate diagnosis, those benefits are not risk-free. CT is a device with higher patient dose in comparison with other conventional radiation procedures.OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating radiation dose to patients from Computed Tomography (CT) examination in Mazandaran hospitals and defining diagnostic reference level (DRL).METHODS: Patient-related data on CT protocol for four common CT examinations including brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic were collected. In each center, Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI) measurements were performed using pencil ionization chamber and CT dosimetry phantom according to AAPM report No. 96 for those techniques. Then, Weighted Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIW), Volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI vol) and Dose Length Product (DLP) were calculated.RESULTS: The CTDIw for brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic ranged (15.6-73), (3.8-25. 8), (4.5-16.3) and (7-16.3), respectively. Values of DLP had a range of (197.4-981), (41.8-184), (131-342.3) and (283.6-486) for brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic, respectively. The 3rd quartile of CTDIW, derived from dose distribution for each examination is the proposed quantity for DRL. The DRLs of brain, sinus, chest and abdomen & pelvic are measured 59.5, 17, 7.8 and 11 mGy, respectively.CONCLUSION: Results of this study demonstrated large scales of dose for the same examination among different centers. For all examinations, our values were lower than international reference doses.",Excluded

PURPOSE: We investigated whether a 3D overlay roadmap using monoplane fluoroscopy offers advantages over a conventional 2D roadmap using biplane fluoroscopy during endovascular aneurysm treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for 131 consecutive cerebral aneurysm embolizations by three neurointerventionalists at a single institution. Allowing for a transition period, the periods from January 2012 to August 2012 (Time Period 1) and February 2013 to July 2013 (Time Period 2) were analyzed for radiation exposure, contrast administration, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, angiographic results, and perioperative complications. Two neurointerventionalists (Group 1) used a conventional 2D roadmap for both Time Periods, and one neurointerventionalist (Group 2) transitioned from a 2D roadmap during Time Period 1 to a 3D overlay roadmap during Time Period 2.RESULTS: During Time Period 2, Group 2 demonstrated reduced fluoroscopy time (p<0.001), procedure time (P=0.023), total radiation dose (p=0.001), and fluoroscopy dose (P=0.017) relative to Group 1. During Time Period 2, there was no difference of immediate angiographic results and procedure complications between the two groups. Through the transition from Time Period 1 to Time Period 2, Group 2 demonstrated decreased fluoroscopy time (p< 0.001), procedure time (p=0.022), and procedure complication rate (p=0.041) in Time Period 2 relative to Time Period 1.CONCLUSION: The monoplane 3D overlay roadmap technique reduced fluoroscopy dose and fluoroscopy time during neurointervention of cerebral aneurysms with similar angiographic occlusions and complications rate relative to biplane 2D roadmap, which implies possible compensation of limitations of monoplane fluoroscopy by 3D overlay technique.",Excluded
1837,"Interlayer Repulsion of Retinal Ganglion Cell Mosaics Regulates Spatial Organization of Functional Maps in the Visual Cortex. In higher mammals, orientation tuning of neurons is organized into a quasi-periodic pattern in the primary visual cortex. Our previous model studies suggested that the topography of cortical orientation maps may originate from moire interference of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics, but did not account for how the consistent spatial period of maps could be achieved. Here we address this issue with two crucial findings on the development of RGC mosaics: first, homotypic local repulsion between RGCs can develop a long-range hexagonal periodicity. Second, heterotypic interaction restrains the alignment of ON and OFF mosaics, and generates a periodic interference pattern map with consistent spatial frequency. To validate our model, we quantitatively analyzed the RGC mosaics in cat data, and confirmed that the observed retinal mosaics showed evidence of heterotypic interactions, contrary to the previous view that ON and OFF mosaics are developed independently. <b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Orientation map is one of the most studied functional maps in the brain, but it has remained unanswered how the consistent spatial periodicity of maps could be developed. In the current study, we address this issue with our developmental model for the retinal origin of orientation map. We showed that local repulsive interactions between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can develop a hexagonal periodicity in the RGC mosaics and restrict the alignment between ON and OFF mosaics, so that they generate a periodic pattern with consistent spatial frequency for both the RGC mosaics and the cortical orientation maps. Our results demonstrate that the organization of functional maps in visual cortex, including its structural consistency, may be constrained by a retinal blueprint.",Excluded

In this study, we demonstrate a novel platform for optical stimulation of neural circuits combined with a microfluidic culture method and microelectrode array measurements. Neuron-on-a-chip was designed and fabricated to isolate axons without a soma or dendrite. Thus, it is readily able to manipulate the neuronal alignment and to investigate the neuronal activity at the locations we want to observe. We adapted the optical stimulation technique to the arranged neurons to generate the neuronal signals in a non-invasive fashion. A blue light-emitting diode and a femtosecond laser with 780 nm center wavelength were used for neuronal activation and the corresponding neuronal signals were measured by MEAs at the same time. We found that one-photon light via caged glutamate provoked periodic spiking. In contrast, the femtosecond pulse irradiation generated repetitive firing at constant rates. Response times of one-photon and two-photon stimulation were around 200 ms and 50 ms, respectively. We also quantified neural responses, by varying optical parameters such as exposure time and irradiation power.",Excluded

Objective This study aimed to examine the association between normal-but-low folate levels and cognitive function in the elderly population using a prospective cohort study. Methods We analyzed 3,910 participants whose serum folate levels were within the normal reference range (1.5-16.9 ng/mL) at baseline evaluation in the population-based prospective cohort study named the ""Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and De-mentia."" The association between baseline folate quartile categories and baseline cognitive disorders [mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia] was examined using binary logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounding variables. The risks of incident MCI and dementia associated with the decline of serum folate level during a 4-year follow-up period were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results The lowest quartile group of serum folate (>=1.5, <=5.9 ng/mL) showed a higher risk of cognitive disorders than did the highest quartile group at baseline evaluation (odds ratio 1.314, p=0.012). Over the 4 years of follow-up, the risk of incident dementia was 2.364 times higher among subjects whose serum folate levels declined from the 2nd-4th quartile group to the 1st quartile than among those for whom it did not (p=0.031). Conclusion Normal-but-low serum folate levels were associated with the risk of cognitive disorders in the elderly population, and a decline to normal-but-low serum folate levels was associated with incident dementia. Maintaining serum folate concentration above 5.9 ng/mL may be beneficial for cognitive status. Copyright © 2019 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.",Excluded

The ""wholy grale"" in radiotherapy is the search for a treatment as conformal as possible allowing to apply very high doses on the target while leaving healthy tissues as much as possible outside the prescription isodose. Radiotherapy is characterized by a never ending technical evolution aiming at increasing biological efficacy on the target while reducing toxicity at the level of the surrounding organs at risk. One of the by-products of this ever lasting quest to precision and dose concentration is the concept of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions. For a long time the technique has only been available for cranial non-moving targets, as high precision and moving targets have long been considered antinomic for technical reasons. The clinical need to apply these same concepts for extra-cranial locations, potentially suitable to move during the irradiations, has been a booster to develop informatics and robotics. The result of these technical developments is the CyberKnife. We intend to present this technique and highlight the experience of more than two years of clinical use in the department of radiotherapy in the University Hospital of Liege.

1844,"Textiloma mimicking a recurrent high-grade astrocytoma. Introduction: Textiloma (Txm) is defined as a foreign body-related inflammatory pseudotumor arising from retained nonabsorbable cotton matrix with the associated inflammatory reaction. In current neurosurgical practice, Txm often refers to a resorbable hemostatic agent that is intentionally left in place to prevent the potentially disastrous consequences of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage. Imaging is essential to the workup for Txm, but it cannot be easily distinguished from a recurrent tumor or abscess due to their nonspecific characteristics. Parameter calculations of diffusion weighted imaging are based on complex pharmacokinetic compartment models that allow only an approximation of the biological conditions. This report describes a case of a Txm mimicking a recurrent high-grade astrocytoma including altered advanced neuroimaging techniques in an effort to highlight this possibility in the setting of tumoral recurrence. Materials And Methods: A 69-year-old female presented to our facility with a 6-month history of progressive left-sided weakness. Neuroimaging studies revealed a large non-enhancing mass in the right frontoparietal lobe. Pathology reported a diffuse astrocytoma, WHO grade II with wildtype IDH-1, EGFR amplification and PTEN negative results. After surgical intervention, external beam radiation was given to the remaining areas of residual tumor. Routine MRI revealed a nodular area of contrast enhancement in the dorsal and inferior margin of the biopsy tract, growing between interval scans, perfusion-weighted imaging parameters were elevated, clinically asymptomatic. Result(s): She underwent a complete resection of this area of interest and pathology returned as a Txm with surgicel fibers. Reactive changes were also seen consistent with radiation effect and areas of atypical cells consistent with residual tumor but not significantly mitotically active. She did notrequire any further treatments and was on observation with imaging only for 14 months until another area of progression was seen. Conclusion(s): After treatment of a neoplasm, if unexpected clinical or imaging evidence of recurrence is present, it may be a foreign body reaction to hemostatic material used during the initial surgery. The implications of this case lie in recognizing this entity to avoid unnecessary procedures. Given the technical variability of advanced MRI techniques, there are limits to the sensitivity and specificity of such. The standardization of advanced MRI is well recognized as a pressing clinical and research need.",Excluded
1845,"Validation of a death assay for Angiostrongylus cantonensis larvae (L3) using propidium iodide in a rat model (Rattus norvegicus). Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a pathogenic nematode and the cause of neuroangiostrongyliasis, an eosinophilic meningitis more commonly known as rat lungworm disease. Transmission is thought to be primarily due to ingestion of infective third stage larvae (L3) in gastropods, on produce, or in contaminated water. The gold standard to determine the effects of physical and chemical treatments on the infectivity of A. cantonensis L3 larvae is to infect rodents with treated L3 larvae and monitor for infection, but animal studies are laborious and expensive and also raise ethical concerns. This study demonstrates propidium iodide (PI) to be a reliable marker of parasite death and loss of infective potential without adversely affecting the development and future reproduction of live A. cantonensis larvae. PI staining allows evaluation of the efficacy of test substances in vitro, an improvement upon the use of lack of motility as an indicator of death. Some potential applications of this assay include determining the effectiveness of various anthelmintics, vegetable washes, electromagnetic radiation and other treatments intended to kill larvae in the prevention and treatment of neuroangiostrongyliasis.

1846,"Feasibility of setting up generic alert levels for maximum skin dose in fluoroscopically guided procedures. Purpose: The feasibility of setting-up generic, hospital-independent dose alert levels to initiate vigilance on possible skin injuries in interventional procedures was studied for three high-dose procedures (chemoembolization (TACE) of the liver, neuro-embolization (NE) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) in 9 European countries. Method(s): Gafchromic films and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used to determine the Maximum Skin Dose (MSD). Correlation of the online dose indicators (fluoroscopy time, kerma- or dose-area product (KAP or DAP) and cumulative air kerma at interventional reference point (K<inf>a,r</inf>)) with MSD was evaluated and used to establish the alert levels corresponding to a MSD of 2 Gy and 5 Gy. The uncertainties of alert levels in terms of DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf>, and uncertainty of MSD were calculated. Result(s): About 20-30% of all MSD values exceeded 2 Gy while only 2-6% exceeded 5 Gy. The correlations suggest that both DAP and K<inf>a,r</inf> can be used as a dose indicator for alert levels (Pearson correlation coefficient p mostly >0.8), while fluoroscopy time is not suitable (p mostly <0.6). Generic alert levels based on DAP (Gy cm<sup>2</sup>) were suggested for MSD of both 2 Gy and 5 Gy (for 5 Gy: TACE 750, PCI 250 and NE 400). The suggested levels are close to the lowest values published in several other studies. The uncertainty of the MSD was estimated to be around 10-15% and of hospital-specific skin dose alert levels about 20-30% (with coverage factor k = 1). Conclusion(s): The generic alert levels are feasible for some cases but should be used with caution, only as the first approximation, while hospital-specific alert levels are preferred as the final approach.

1847,"Role of p53 in the regulation of irradiation-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Wild-type p53 plays a crucial role in the control of apoptosis following ionizing radiation (IR); conversely, mutant p53 is associated with IR resistance. Although wild-type p53 is expressed in virtually all neuroblastoma tumors, treatment failures secondary to inadequate local control with radiotherapy are a problem in patients with advanced stage disease. This apparent paradox is the focus of our interest. The Shep-1 neuroblastoma cell line is highly resistant to IR. This cell line contains a wild-type p53 gene and is an ideal model for studying the mechanism of IR resistance in this disease. Following high-dose IR, cell fractionation demonstrated that p53 is induced and targeted to the nucleus. The induced p53 is functional as p53-responsive genes (Waf-1 and MDM-2) are appropriately induced following IR. Intriguingly, overexpression of p53 could reverse the inherent IR resistance of Shep-1 cells. Multiple cell lines expressing variable levels of exogenous temperature-sensitive p53 were generated. Pulse induction of p53 alone did not affect Shep-1 cell viability, while induction of p53, followed by IR, resulted in cell death and DNA fragmentation proportional to the dose of IR and the level of p53 expression. These findings demonstrate that p53 overexpression renders Shep-1 cells IR-sensitive and suggest that large quantities of exogenous p53 can overcome the factors inhibiting p53-mediated, IR-induced apoptosis.",Excluded

Objectives: PET with <sup>89</sup>Zirconium (<sup>89</sup>Zr) labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be used for in vivo quantification of antibody biodistribution and may improve prediction of efficacy and toxicity of mAb treatment. Knowledge about repeatability of these measurements is required to ensure correct interpretation, especially when assessing differences between antibody biodistributions. However, repeatability of <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb PET is unknown, as radiation exposure is significant, thereby limiting test-retest studies. The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of image reconstruction to the repeatability of tissue uptake of <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb for quantification of antibody biodistribution. Method(s): Three clinical <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb PET datasets were included: <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD20 (1, 72, 144 h post injection (p.i.) of 74MBq, n=7), <sup>89</sup>Zr-cetuximab (1, 72, 144 h p.i. of 37MBq, n=7) and <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD44 (1, 24, 96 h p.i. of 37MBq, n=13). For all original images tissue volumes of interest (VOI) were defined. Manual delineation of complete organs (volume range 107-4377 mL) was used to obtain liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain VOI. Fixed size VOI of 2.1 and 8.6 mL were placed in aortic arch and lumbar vertebrae to sample blood pool and bone marrow, respectively. Next, original PET list mode data were split before reconstruction, simulating test-retest scans. All VOI were applied to these test-retest scans. Mean activity concentrations (AC) were derived from these VOI. Repeatability was assessed using Bland-Altman plots (percentage difference versus mean activity concentration in Bq/mL, limits of agreement (LOA)), and repeatability coefficients (RC) were calculated (1.96xSD of the mean percentage difference). Result(s): Repeatability for all mAbs decreased with time. For <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD44 (18MBq), RCs were 8.0, 10.4 and 16.5% at 1, 24 and 96 h p.i., respectively. RCs for larger, manual VOIs were 7.2%, while RCs for smaller, fixed size VOIs were 28% at 96 h p.i. (Figure 1). For <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD20 (18MBq)/<sup>89</sup>Zr-cetuximab (18MBq), RCs for all VOIs were 13.7/9.9, 17.9/14.9 and 26.1/24.6% at 1, 72 and 144 h p.i., respectively. For a higher injected dose, repeatability improved. For 37MBq of <sup>89</sup>Zr-antiCD20, RCs were 8.2, 9.9 and 22.6% at 1, 72 and 144 hours p.i., respectively. Conclusion(s): For large, manually delineated tissue VOI a lower RC was obtained compared with smaller, fixed sized VOI. In general, RC of tissue uptake of <sup>89</sup>Zr-mAb was around 15 and 25% for imaging at 72 and 144 h p.i., respectively.

OBJECTIVE: We studied changes of the EEG spectral power induced by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Also analyzed were changes of visual evoked potentials (VEP) with DBS on and off.METHODS: Eleven patients with advanced PD treated with bilateral DBS STN were examined after an overnight withdrawal of L-DOPA and 2 h after switching off the neurostimulators. All underwent clinical examination followed by resting EEG and VEP recordings, a procedure repeated after DBS STN was switched on.RESULTS: With DBS switched on, the dominant EEG frequency increased from 9.44+/-1.3 to 9.71+/-1.3 Hz (P<0.01) while its relative spectral power dropped by 11% on average (P<0.05). Switching on the neurostimulators caused a decrease in the N70/P100 amplitude of the VEP (P<0.01), which inversely correlated with the intensity of DBS (black-and-white pattern: P<0.01; color pattern: P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Despite artifacts generated by neurostimulators, the VEP and resting EEG were suitable for the detection of effects related to DBS STN. The acceleration of dominant frequency in the alpha band may be evidence of DBS STN influence on speeding up of intracortical oscillations. The spectral power decrease, seen mainly in the fronto-central region, might reflect a desynchronization in the premotor and motor circuits, though no movement was executed. Similarly, desynchronization of the cortical activity recorded posteriorly may by responsible for the VEP amplitude decrease implying DBS STN-related influence even on the visual system.SIGNIFICANCE: Changes in idling EEG activity observed diffusely over scalp together with involvement of the VEP suggest that the effects of DBS STN reach far beyond the motor system influencing the basic mechanisms of rhythmic cortical oscillations.",Excluded
1851,"CRF-like receptor SEB-3 in sex-common interneurons potentiates stress handling and reproductive drive in C. elegans. Environmental conditions can modulate innate behaviours. Although male Caenorhabditis elegans copulation can be perturbed in the presence of stress, the mechanisms underlying its decision to sustain copulation are unclear. Here we describe a mating interference assay, which quantifies the persistence of male C. elegans copulation in noxious blue light. We show that between copulations, the male escapes from blue light illumination at intensities over 370 muW mm(-2). This response is attenuated in mutants with constitutive activation of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor family homologue SEB-3. We show that activation of this receptor causes sex-common glutamatergic lumbar ganglion interneurons (LUA) to potentiate downstream male-specific reproduction circuits, allowing copulatory behaviours to partially override the light-induced escape responses in the male. SEB-3 activation in LUA also potentiates copulation during mild starvation. We suggest that SEB-3 activation allows C. elegans to acclimate to the environment and thus continue to execute innate behaviours even under non-optimal conditions.",Excluded

1853,"Identification of novel p53 target genes in ionizing radiation response. The tumor suppressor p53 plays an essential role in cellular adaptation to stress. In response to ionizing radiation, p53 regulates the transcription of genes in a diverse set of pathways including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Previously, we identified by microarray analysis a set of genes that are transcriptionally activated or repressed in response to radiation exposure. In this study, we use computational methods and molecular techniques, including location analysis (ChIP-on-chip assay), to identify ionizing radiation-responsive genes that are directly regulated by p53. Among the 489 ionizing radiation-responsive genes examined, 38 genes were found to be p53 targets. Some of these genes are previously known to be directly regulated by p53 whereas others are novel p53 targets. We further showed that the novel p53 target genes are transcriptionally regulated by p53. The binding of p53 to promoters of target genes correlated with increased transcript levels of these genes in cells with functional p53. However, p53 binding and subsequent transcriptional activation of these target genes were significantly diminished in cells with mutant p53 and in cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia, which have impaired p53 activation following ionizing radiation exposure.

OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Liponeurocytomas are rare cerebellar neoplasms in adults, with benign histological features and a favorable clinical prognosis. Current clinical opinion is based on a total of less than 20 published cases and suggests that gross total resection and long-term follow-up monitoring, with possible additional surgery and radiotherapy for treatment of recurrent tumors, represent the best treatment approach for this relatively benign tumor type. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old Caucasian woman presented with worsening unsteady gait and headaches, suggesting increased intracranial pressure. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent subtotal resection of a cerebellar liponeurocytoma, followed by fractionated radiotherapy (total dose of 54 Gy). She experienced a local recurrence of the tumor 12 months later and underwent additional surgery for removal of the cerebellar mass. A second recurrent tumor was diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging scans 3 months later and was surgically resected. The tumor histological findings were consistently devoid of atypical features, apart from leptomeningeal invasion noted in the first surgical specimen. CONCLUSION(S): This unusual case demonstrated an atypical clinical course of a highly aggressive and radiation-resistant tumor, despite the consistent absence of aggressive histological features.

1855,"Enhanced excitability induced by ionizing radiation in the kindled rat. Evidence derived from both clinical and experimental investigations has suggested an influence of ionizing radiation on focal epileptogenicity. To better characterize this influence we applied focal ionizing radiation to a kindled epileptic focus in the rat amygdala. The right and left basolateral amygdala and right frontal cortex were implanted with concentric bipolar electrodes. Rats were kindled through a minimum of 10 stage 5 seizures by afterdischarge-threshold electrostimulation of the left amygdala, after which generalized seizure thresholds were determined prior to irradiation. The left amygdala was exposed to single-fraction central-axis doses of either 18 or 25 Gy using a beam-collimated (60)Co source (1.25 MeV). Generalized seizure thresholds were then redetermined at weekly intervals for 10 weeks and at monthly intervals for an additional 3 months. We observed no significant changes in seizure threshold during the postirradiation interval; however, we did observe persistent changes in seizure dynamics manifesting within the first week postirradiation. These consisted of an increased tendency for seizure activity to propagate into brain stem circuits during the primary ictus (i.e., ""running fits"") and an increased tendency for secondary convulsions to emerge postictally. These effects involving seizure dynamics have not been reported previously and appear to represent a radiation-induced disinhibition of one or more neural circuits. The disparity between these effects and earlier reports of seizure-suppressive effects resulting from analogous radiation exposures is discussed in relation to kindling and status epilepticus-induced pathogenesis within the hippocampus.",Included

BACKGROUND: Treatment of local relapse in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) following prior radiation remains a challenge: without the possibility of surgical salvage patients face the choice between palliative chemotherapy and re-irradiation. Chemotherapy yields response rates around 30% and application of tumouricidal doses is difficult due to proximity of critical structures. Carbon ion therapy (C12) is a promising method to minimize side-effects and maximize re-treatment dose in this indication. We describe our initial results for re-irradiation in heavily pre-treated ACC patients.METHODS: Patients treated with carbon ion therapy between 04/2010 and 05/2013 (N=52pts, median age: 54 a) were retrospectively evaluated regarding toxicity (NCI CTC v.4), tumour response (RECIST) and control rates. 48pts (92.3%) received carbon ions only, 4pts received IMRT plus C12.RESULTS: 4pts were treated following R1-resection, 43pts for inoperable local relapse. Most common tumour sites were paranasal sinus (36.5%), parotid (19.2%), and base of skull (17.3%). Pts received a median dose of 51GyE C12/63Gy BED and cumulative dose of 128Gy BED [67-182Gy] after a median RT-interval of 61months. Median target volume was 93ml [9-618ml]. No higher-grade (>degreeII) acute reactions were observed, 7pts showed blood-brain-barrier changes (degreeI/II: 8pts; degreeIII: 2pts), 1 pt corneal ulceration, xerophthalmia 7pts, degreeIV bleeding 1 pt, tissue necrosis 2pts, otherwise no significant late reactions. Objective response rate (CR/PR) was 56.6%. With a median follow-up of 14months [1-39months] local control and distant control at 1a are 70.3% and 72.6% respectively. Of the 18pts with local relapse, 13pts have recurred in-field, 1 pt at the field edge, 3pts out of field, and one in the dose gradient.CONCLUSION: Despite high applied doses, C12 re-irradiation shows moderate side-effects, response rates even in these heavily pre-treated patients are encouraging and present a good alternative to palliative chemotherapy.

The standard therapy for the treatment of GBM is surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. However, the frequency of tumor recurrence in GBM patients is very high, and the survival rate remains poor. Delineating the mechanisms of GBM recurrence is essential for therapeutic advances. Here, we demonstrate that irradiation rendered 17-20 % of GBM cells dead, but resulted in 60-80 % of GBM cells growth-arrested with increases in senescence markers, such as senescence-associated beta-galactosidase-positive cells, H3K9me3-positive cells, and p53-p21(CIP1)-positive cells. Moreover, irradiation induced expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) mRNAs and NFkappaB transcriptional activity in GBM cells. Strikingly, compared to injection of non-irradiated GBM cells into immune-deficient mice, the co-injection of irradiated and non-irradiated GBM cells resulted in faster growth of tumors with the histological features of human GBM. Taken together, our findings suggest that the increases in senescent cells and SASP in GBM cells after irradiation is likely one of main reasons for tumor recurrence in post-radiotherapy GBM patients.",Excluded
1858,"Re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas: Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors. Purpose/Objective(s): To analyze the treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of survival for patients with recurrent gliomas treated with reirradiation, and to identify subgroups for whom re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas is most beneficial. Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with recurrent or progressive gliomas received re-irradiation between 1996 and 2011. The median age of the patients was 43 years (range, 20-63 years). Pathologic subtypes were glioblastomas in 21 patients (58.3%), WHO grade III astrocytomas in 8 patients (22.2%), and WHO grade I/II astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas in 7 patients (19.4%). In 27 patients, re-irradiation for recurrent gliomas was preceded by subtotal (19/36; 52.8%) or total (8/36; 22.2%) tumor resection. The median time interval between initial radiation therapy (RT) and re-irradiation was 30.5 months (range, 4-173 months). Radiation doses of the first and second radiation course were 32.4-70.0 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) and 30.0-64.6 Gy (median 45 Gy). The cumulative radiation doses were 82.8-123.0 Gy (median 100.2 Gy), and the median cumulative biological equivalent doses (BED) were 195.8 (a/b = 2 Gy) and 102.3 Gy (a/b = 10 Gy). All patients were followed-up until death or the time of analysis. Result(s): Thirty-two patients died of disease 2-50 months after re-irradiation and one patient was alive with disease 12 months after re-irradiation. Three patients are alive without disease 8-50 months after re-irradiation. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.5 months (range, 2-50 months), and the 6 and 12months OS rates were 83.3 and 39.4%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.5 months, and 6-months and 12-months PFS rates were 71.09 and 41.7%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <=70 (p<0.001), the dose of re-irradiation <=40 Gy(p = 0.019), and the length of time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation(p = 0.029) were associated with improvement in OS. In multivariate analysis, KPS (p=0.033) was the most important predictors for OS. Histologic subtype (GBM vs non-GBM, median OS, 8 vs 12 months, p=0.668) and surgical resection (median OS, 9 vs 12 months, p = 0.810) had no significant benefit on OS. Radiographically suspected radiation necrosis (RN) after re-irradiation was seen in 6 patients (16.7%) whose median cumulative radiation doses were 100.4 Gy, and a median cumulative BED were 198.4 Gy (a/b=2 Gy). At 3, 7 and 8 months after re-irradiation, neurological deterioration occurred in 3 patients, and was managed with dexamethasone and anticonvulsant drug. Conclusion(s): Approximately 45 Gy of re-irradiation after 60 Gy of initial radiation therapy was feasible without serious complications. Re-irradiation could be suggested as an alternative salvage treatment for selected recurrent glioma patients with good performance status and recurrence over a longer period of time.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Forty-eight patients with malignant glioma were treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy followed by multiagent chemotherapy to explore feasibility and toxicity of such combined modality treatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: There were 34 males and 14 females with a median age of 53 years (range, 32-74 years) and median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1 (range, 0-3). Histology included anaplastic astrocytoma in 11 patients and glioblastoma multiforme in 37 patients. Radiation was given at 1.2 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day, for a total dose of 72 Gy, with a reduction in field size after 52.8 Gy. Four weeks after completion of hyperfractionated radiation therapy multiagent chemotherapy was introduced with bischlorethyl nitrosourea (BCNU) 50 mg/m2, days 1-3, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (max. 2 mg), day 1, procarbazine 50 mg/m2, days 1-7 and cisplatin 20 mg/m2, days 1-3. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks to a maximum of six cycles or until tumor progression was noted.RESULTS: Median survival time for all patients was 52 weeks (range, 16-185 weeks) and median time to tumor progression was 30.5 weeks (range, 12-131 weeks). Besides age, histology, performance status, and extent of surgery, interfraction interval and location of tumor influenced survival in glioblastoma multiforms patients on univariate analysis: Patients treated with shorter intervals (4.5-5 h) did better than those treated with longer intervals (5.5-6 h); also, glioblastoma multiforme patients with frontal tumors did better than those with tumors of the other locations. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the performance status, interfraction interval, and tumor location were significant prognostic factors in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Acute toxicity was mild. No cases of brain necroses were observed.CONCLUSION: Hyperfractionated radiation therapy followed by multiagent chemotherapy was well tolerated with mild acute and virtually no late toxicity. More patients and longer follow-up are needed for further evaluation of its activity and late effects in anaplastic astrocytoma patients.",Excluded

Aim: The purpose of our review was to evaluate results of radiosurgery for patients with brain metastases from lung cancer. Background(s): Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer and the most common source of brain metastases. Radiosurgery allows the precise focal delivery of a high single radiation dose to brain metastases and results in high rates of local control. Material(s) and Method(s): 83 patients were treated between 2006 and 2008. We evaluated local control and outcome after radiosurgery and identified prognostic factors. Result(s): Median survival in the whole group was 7.8 months from radiosurgery and 11 months from diagnosis. Median survival in classes I, II and III was 13.2, 8.2 and 2.2 months. For 94% of patients symptoms improved or stabilised at the first follow-up visit and this status did not change during 7.1 months. According to the univariate analysis, factors associated with improved survival included: RPA class 1 compared with RPA 2 and 3, RPA class 2 compared with RPA 3, KPS>70, control of the primary disease, radiosurgery performed more than once, level of haemoglobin >7mmol/1, absence of extracranial metastases, volume of the biggest lesion <11cm<sup>3</sup>. The multivariate analysis confirmed a significant influence on survival for the following factors: RPA class 1 as compared with RPA 3, KPS>70, absence of extracranial metastases, multiplicity of radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment. It proved to be effective and safe in older patients. Selection of patients who are likely to benefit most should be based on prognostic factors. KPS proved to be the most important prognostic factor. In the RPA III group (patients with KPS. <. 70) survival time was similar to that achieved after symptomatic medical management. © 2013 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.",Excluded
1862,"The treatment options of recurred brain metastasis after prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with small-cell lung cancer. Background: Even after prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), many small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients succumb to brain metastasis. Brain metastasis after PCI is an unsolved issue in SCLC in terms of its dismal prognosis and the limitation of further treatment options. Regarding the treatment option, it is not determined whether re-whole brain radiotherapy (re-WBRT) is safe or gamma-knife surgery (GKS) has its role in SCLC. We investigated which treatment option could be recommended as the up-front therapy to improve survival for SCLC patients with brain metastasis who were previously treated with PCI. Method(s): The medical records were reviewed for SCLC patients who experienced brain metastases after receiving PCI from 2000 to 2010. We compared overall survival according to the modality of up-front therapy. Overall survival was determined as time from brain metastasis to death due to any cause. Result(s): In total, 245 patients had received PCI in a state of limited disease (n = 204) or extensive disease status (n = 41). Among them, 47 (19.2%) experienced brain metastases: 16.7% (34/204) in LD and 31.7% (13/41) in ED. At the time when brain metastasis developed, extracrainal disease was also on progressing state in 19 patients (40.4%). The modality of up-front therapy for brain metastasis was as follows: 17 (36.1%) got GKS, 14(29.8%) re-WBRT, 7 (14.9%) up-front chemotherapy without local therapy, and 9 (19.1%) did not receive any further treatment. The median overall survival after brain metastasis was 4.9 months. Among 31 patients who received GKS or re-WBRT, 10 patients received at least one subsequent chemotherapy in their lifetime after GKS (6/17, 35.3%) or re-WBRT (4/14, 28.6%). The median survival of GKS, re-WBRT and chemotherapy was 14.3, 3.9 and 6.0 months (P = 0.24), which showed the tendency favoring for up-front GKS. Although it failed to meet statistical significance. Conclusion(s): The up-front GKS showed longer survival in patients who experienced brain metastasis after PCI for SCLC, compared with re-WBRT or chemotherapy only. However, the number of participants was too small to get confirmatory results requiring a prospective therapy to demonstrate the role of GKS in this setting.",Excluded
1863,"Focused ultrasound enhanced intranasal delivery of brain derived neurotrophic factor produces neurorestorative effects in a Parkinson's disease mouse model. Focused ultrasound-enhanced intranasal (IN + FUS) delivery is a noninvasive approach that utilizes the olfactory pathway to administer pharmacological agents directly to the brain, allowing for a more homogenous distribution in targeted locations compared to IN delivery alone. However, whether such a strategy has therapeutic values, especially in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), remains to be established. Herein, we evaluated whether the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine catalysis, could be enhanced by IN + FUS delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a toxin-based PD mouse model. Mice were put on the subacute dosing regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), producing bilateral degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway consistent with early-stage PD. MPTP mice then received BDNF intranasally followed by multiple unilateral FUS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings in the left basal ganglia for three consecutive weeks. Subsequently, mice were survived for two months and were evaluated morphologically and behaviorally to determine the integrity of their nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Mice receiving IN + FUS had significantly increased TH immunoreactivity in the treated hemisphere compared to the untreated hemisphere while mice receiving only FUS-induced BBB opening or no treatment at all did not show any differences. Additionally, behavioral changes were only observed in the IN + FUS treated mice, indicating improved motor control function in the treated hemisphere. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the method and potential of IN + FUS for the delivery of bioactive factors for treatment of neurodegenerative disorder.",Excluded
1864,"Increased hippocampal TrkA expression ameliorates cranial radiation-induced neurogenesis impairment and cognitive deficit via PI3K/AKT signaling. Cognitive deficit is one of the most serious complications of cranial radiotherapy of head and neck cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of this cognitive impairment remains unclear. In the present study, the role of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and its ligand neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) were investigated following whole-brain irradiation (WBI). Young male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent WBI at a single dose of 10 Gy. WBI was determined to result in notable memory decline and substantial neurogenesis impairment in the hippocampus 3 months post-irradiation. Compared with the control group, TrkA protein expression was greater in irradiated rats 1 week after WBI, which then decreased significantly by the 3-month time-point. However, no difference in NGF expression was observed from 1 day to 3 months post-WBI. Overexpression of hippocampal TrkA in rats using adeno-associated virus ameliorated memory decline induced by irradiation. Additionally, upregulating TrkA expression rescued irradiation-induced hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and promoted neurogenesis. PI3K, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were also revealed to be significantly inhibited by WBI, which was ameliorated by TrkA overexpression. Findings of the present study indicated that the TrkA-dependent signaling pathway may serve a critical role in radiotherapy-induced cognitive deficit and impairments in neurogenesis.",Included
1865,"Structural Basis of the Molecular Switch between Phosphatase and Mutase Functions of Human Phosphomannomutase 1 under Ischemic Conditions. The human phosphomannomutases PMM1 and PMM2 catalyze the interconversion of hexose 6-phosphates and hexose 1-phosphates. The two isoforms share 66% sequence identity and have kinetic properties similar to those of mutases in vitro but differ in their functional roles in vivo. Though the physiological role of PMM2 is catalysis of the mutase reaction that provides the mannose 1-phosphate (Man-1-P) essential for protein glycosylation, PMM1 is thought to provide a phosphohydrolase activity in the presence of inosine monophosphate (IMP), converting glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Glu-1,6-P<inf>2</inf>) to glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P), rescuing glycolysis during brain ischemia. To uncover the structural basis of how IMP binding converts PMM1 from a mutase to a phosphatase, the 1.93 A resolution structure of PMM1 complexed with IMP was determined. The structure reveals IMP bound at the substrate recruitment site, thus inhibiting the mutase activity while simultaneously activating a phosphatase activity (IMP K<inf>act</inf> = 1.5 muM) resulting from the hydrolysis of the phospho-enzyme. The bound structure and site-directed mutagenesis confirm that the long-range electrostatic interactions provided by Arg180 and Arg183 conserved in PMM1 are the major contributors to IMP binding, and their oblation removes phosphatase but not mutase activity. These residues are not present in the PMM2 isoform, which consequently lacks significant phosphatase activity in the presence of IMP. T<inf>2</inf> relaxation nuclear magnetic resonance and small angle X-ray scattering together support the hypothesis that binding of IMP to PMM1 favors an enzyme conformation that is catalytically competent for water attack at the phosphoaspartyl intermediate. Such a mechanism may be generalizable to other enzymes that act through covalent intermediates. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",Excluded
1866,"Clinical research on stereotactic radiosurgery combined with epithermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of brain metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer.

Patients were divided into two groups according to their treatment types. Fifty seven patients were treated with SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs, while another 57 patients were treated with WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs. The clinical efficacy, intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS), systemic progression-free survival (sPFS), overall survival (OS,) and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used for imaging evaluation in both groups and all patients underwent symptomatic treatment such as dehydration or hormone therapy according to the patient's condition. The efficacy was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1) and adverse reactions were assessed based on the criteria for toxic reaction of anti-cancer drugs of WHO.RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in general conditions between the two groups of patients. The median iPFS and median sPFS were similar between the two groups (12.2 months vs. 11.5 months and 10.7 months vs. 9.8 months respectively, p>0.05). The median OS of patients treated with SRS + EGFR-TKIs was significantly longer than in those treated with WBRT + EGFR-TKIs (25.1 months vs. 22.0 months, respectively, p=0.042). No statistically significant differences were found in the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), the incidence rates of cytopenia, gastrointestinal reaction and liver dysfunction between the two groups (p>0.05). There were 8 cases with radiotherapy-associated grade 3 or higher brain damage in SRS + EGFR-TKIs group compared to 19 cases in those treated with WBRT + EGFR-TKIs, suggesting that the incidence rate of radiation-induced brain injuries in SRS + EGFR-TKIs group was remarkably lower than those in WBRT + EGFR-TKIs group (p=0.026).CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy of SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs is comparable to that of WBRT combined with EGFR-TKIs in the treatment of NSCLC patients with <=3 brain metastases and EGFR-sensitive mutation and the OS of patients is longer, with lower toxic side effect and higher safety, hence SRS combined with EGFR-TKIs should be used as the preferred therapeutic regimen.",Excluded

Background: Acute in situ thrombosis is an ischaemic phenomenon during Pipeline embolisation device (PED) procedures with potentially high morbidity and mortality. There is controversy regarding the role of platelet function testing with P2Y12 assay as a predictor of intraprocedural thromboembolic events. There is limited knowledge on whether procedural complexity influences these events.Methods: Data were collected retrospectively on 742 consecutive PED cases at a single institution. Patients with intraprocedural acute thrombosis were compared with patients without these events.Results: A cohort of 37 PED cases with acute in situ thrombosis (mean age 53.8 years, mean aneurysm size 8.4 mm) was matched with a cohort of 705 PED cases without intraprocedural thromboembolic events (mean age 56.4 years, mean aneurysm size 6.9 mm). All patients with in situ thrombosis received intra-arterial and/or intravenous abciximab. The two groups were evenly matched in patient demographics, previous treatment/subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and aneurysm location. There was no statistical difference in postprocedural P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values between the two groups, with a mean of 156 in the in situ thrombosis group vs 148 in the control group (p=0.5894). Presence of cervical carotid tortuosity, high cavernous internal carotid artery grade, need for multiple PED and vasospasm were not significantly different between the two groups. The in situ thrombosis group had statistically significant longer fluoroscopy time (60.4 vs 38.4 min, p<0.0001), higher radiation exposure (3476 vs 2160 mGy, p<0.0001), higher rates of adjunctive coiling (24.3% vs 8.37%, p=0.0010) and higher utilisation of balloon angioplasty (37.8% vs 12.2%, p<0.0001). Clinically, the in situ thrombosis cohort had higher incidence of major and minor stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage and length of stay.Conclusions: Predictors of procedural complexity (higher radiation exposure, longer fluoroscopy time, adjunctive coiling and need for balloon angioplasty) are associated with acute thrombotic events during PED placement, independent of PRU values.",Excluded

1871,"Preclinical MRI reveals anti-VEGF therapy mitigates radiation necrosis. Purpose: Radiation necrosis, a severe but late occurring injury to normal tissue within and surrounding a radiation treatment field, has been described as a slow, continuous process in which increased levels of VEGF-A lead to breakdown of the blood brain barrier [1]. Thus, a strategy that involves blocking VEGF-A from reaching capillaries and repairing ""leaky"" capillaries is a possible therapeutic approach for radiation necrosis. In this work, in concert with a novel mouse model of radiation necrosis [2], the therapeutic effects of the humanized anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech) and the murine anti-VEGF antibody B20-4.1.1 (Genentech) are monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. Method(s): Hemispheric irradiation of mouse brain was performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife PerfexionTM (GK), a state-of-the-art unit used for stereotactic irradiation of patients with malignant brain tumors. Three cohorts of 7-8 week old female mice (n=5) were irradiated with a single 60-Gy dose (50% isodose) of GK radiation. At this dose, the onset of radiation necrosis typically occurs 3-4 weeks post-irradiation. Mouse cohort #1 was an irradiated but untreated control; cohort #2 received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, twice weekly) from 3-to-10 weeks post-irradiation; cohort #3 received B20- 4.1.1 (10 mg/kg, twice weekly) from 4-to-13 weeks post-irradiation. Mice were imaged from 3-to-10 weeks post-irradiation, using an Agilent/Varian DirectDriveTM 4.7-T small-animal MR scanner. Result(s): The MRI-derived volumes of radiation necrosis for control, bevacizumab-treated, and B20-4.1.1-treated mice are plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of time post-irradiation. Both anti-VEGF antibodies slow the overall rate of progression (p<0.0001, week 10). Considering the initial 3-7 week period postirradiation, bevacizumab has the same mitigative effect as B20-4.1.1 (p = 0.8, week 7). However, for the latter 3-week period (7-10 weeks post-irradiation), radiation-induced necrosis developed at a higher rate than in the B20-4.1.1-treated cohort (p<0.0001, week 10), indicating that the mitigative effect of bevacizumab was weaker than B20-4.1.1 in the late period following the initiation of treatment. Histology results support the MR data. The irradiated hemispheres of the control mice demonstrated many of the classic histologic features of radiation necrosis. In contrast, the irradiated hemisphere of the bevacizumab-treated mouse showed only modest tissue damage and the irradiated hemisphere of the B20-4.1.1-treated mouse displayed no visible tissue damage. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate a significant mitigative effect of bevacizumab and B20-4.1.1 in a mouse model of radiation necrosis, an effect also observed recently in a group of brain-tumor patients treated with bevacizumab [3]. Efforts to verify the mechanism of action of bevacizumab and B20-4.1.1 in the treatment of radiation necrosis in the mouse model are ongoing. (Graph presented).",Excluded

The objectives of the present study were to explore the clinical characteristics and potential prognostic factors in CRC patients with BM. Between April 1991 and December 2010, all CRC patients treated in the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed and 60 patients were identified to have BM (36 males and 24 females). The association between patients and their tumor characteristics, treatment modality, and survival were statistically analyzed. The median age at diagnosis of BM was 62.5 years. Fifty-three patients (88.3%) developed extracranial metastases at diagnosis of BM. The cause of death was systemic disease in 19 patients and neurological disease in 23 patients. Brain metastases were primarily treated with either whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT; 15 patients), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; nine patients), or surgical resection (seven patients). Ten patients received WBRT and SRS, and 19 patients (31.7%) were treated with steroids alone. The median survival after diagnosis of BM was 8 months (95% confidence interval = 4.2-11.8 months). Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, the number of brain lesions, and treatment modality type were significantly associated with survival. Although BM from CRC is a late-stage phenomenon with an extremely poor prognosis, some subsets of patients would benefit from a multidisciplinary management strategy.

1873,"The modulatory role of taurine in retinal ganglion cells. Taurine (2-aminoethylsuphonic acid) is present in nearly all animal tissues, and is the most abundant free amino acid in muscle, heart, CNS, and retina. Although it is known to be a major cytoprotectant and essential for normal retinal development, its role in retinal neurotransmission and modulation is not well understood. We investigated the response of taurine in retinal ganglion cells, and its effect on synaptic transmission between ganglion cells and their presynaptic neurons. We find that taurine-elicited currents in ganglion cells could be fully blocked by both strychnine and SR95531, glycine and GABA(A) receptor antagonists, respectively. This suggests that taurine-activated receptors might share the antagonists with GABA and glycine receptors. The effect of taurine at micromolar concentrations can effectively suppress spontaneous vesicle release from the presynaptic neurons, but had limited effects on light-evoked synaptic signals in ganglion cells. We also describe a metabotropic effect of taurine in the suppression of light-evoked response in ganglion cells.

BACKGROUND: Current medical therapies for patients who have an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) focus on the coagulation cascade and platelet inhibition. These, coupled with early use of cardiac catheterization and revascularization, have decreased morbidity and mortality rates in patients who have acute ischemic heart disease with risk of bleeding.OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The effect of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment was also analyzed.METHODS: This case-control study evaluated gastrointestinal bleeding within a year of PCI for stable angina and acute coronary syndromes at Nanjing First Hospital between 2008 and 2011. Cases were identified and outcomes assessed using linkage analysis of data from cardiology and gastroenterology department databases. Analysis of the case and control groups for both risk and protective factors was performed using independent two-sample Student's t-test with Fisher's exact P value and logistic regression.RESULTS: The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding following PCI was 1.3% (35/2680 patients). The risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding were advanced age, female gender, smoking, drinking, previous peptic ulcer and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. PPI use after PCI (P=0.000) was accompanied by a lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, with only a few cases of gastrointestinal bleeding events reported.CONCLUSION: The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel therapy was estimated to be 1.3%. Advanced age, being female, smokers, drinkers, previous peptic ulcer and previous gastrointestinal bleeding were significant independent risk factors. PPI for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding induced by the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel in patients after PCI was safe and effective.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to determine whether neuropsychologic functioning differs in breast cancer survivors 6 months after the completion of adjuvant treatment compared with women without cancer.METHODS: Participants were 187 women who were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ or stage I or stage II breast cancer and 187 age-matched and geographically matched women without cancer. Of the survivors, 97 had been treated after surgery with chemotherapy only or chemotherapy plus radiotherapy and 90 had been treated after surgery with radiotherapy only (grading determined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer grading system).RESULTS: Small but statistically significant differences in cognitive functioning and cognitive impairment were observed in those survivors who were treated with chemotherapy and their matched controls, as well as in survivors treated with radiotherapy only and their matched controls. No group differences were observed with regard to cognitive symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Data from the current study suggest that cognitive deficits are subtle and likely the result of the general effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment rather than systemic treatment.",Included

The effects of Ga-Al-As diode laser (830 nm, 16.2 mW) irradiation on the distal portion of the processes of cultured murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons associated with C-fibers were studied by patch-clamp whole-cell recording of membrane potentials at the cell body. The chemical as well as laser light stimulations were limited to the processes of the neuron isolated from the cell body with a separator. The action potentials elicited by bradykinin (BK) in the cell body were reversibly suppressed by the irradiation of laser light. The laser irradiation may block the conduction of nociceptive signals in primary afferent neurons. The present experimental method offers a simple and easy to use procedure for studying the pain relief effects by laser irradiation.",Excluded
1877,"A promising F18 labeled PET radiotracer (-)-[<sup>18</sup>F]VAT for assessing the VAChT in vivo. Objectives The loss of cholinergic neurons correlates with the severity of cognitive dysfunction in dementias, including AD and PD and other CNS disorders. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) is a reliable biomarker for cholinergic neurons. Compound (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT possesses high binding potency and selectivity towards VAChT (K<inf>i-VAChT</inf> = 0.59 nM, K<inf>i-sigma1, sigma2</inf> > 10,000 nM). Here we report the radiosynthesis and in vivo evaluation of (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT in rodent and nonhuman primates. Methods (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT was synthesized by a two-step alkylation of the phenol precursor. Biodistribution studies were performed in male SD rats at 5, 30, 60, and 120 min post injection. MicroPET studies were performed in male cynomolgus monkeys (4-6 Kg) using a microPET Focus 220 scanner. Dosimetry studies were performed in one female and two male monkeys. Results (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT was synthesized in high specific activity (>2 Ci/mumol, EOB) and a yield of 30-45% (decay corrected). Biodistribution studies revealed that (-)-[<sup>18</sup> F]VAT specifically accumulates in VAChT-enriched striatum area: at 60 min, the uptake(s) (ID%/g) in striatum, cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum are 0.82, 0.43, 0.42, 0.45 and 0.29 repectively. No significant defluorination was observed. The uptake in striatum versus cerebellum reached 2.8-fold at 60 min post-injection. MicroPET brain imaging studies in nonhuman primates revealed that the striatum has the highest uptake and displayed clear striatum-to-cerebellum contrast (2.6-fold ratio). Dosimetry studies suggested that injection of 20 mCi into humans will not exceed allowable radiation exposure. Conclusions (-)-[18F]VAT is a promising PET tracer for quantifying the expression of VAChT in the brain of animals. These promising in vivo animal results permit us to seek IND and RDRC approval for translational clinical investigation in human subjects.",Excluded
1878,"Reversible brain swelling in experimental cerebral malaria. Recently, reversible brain swelling has been identified in cerebral malaria patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is unknown, if similar pathology occurs in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). We thus examined immunized C57BL/6 mice after single vaccination with radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) and naive C57BL/6 mice upon infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA-expressing mCherry. All mice were assessed according to the Rapid Murine Coma and Behavioral Scale (RMCBS) score once naive mice showed ECM. We further analyzed brain pathology by using high resolution small animal MRI in order to assess brain swelling and blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), immunohistochemical staining for microglia, single plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) to locate parasites microscopically and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to study parasites on a nanoscopic level. In contrast to naive mice, that showed extensive BBBD and brain swelling, all immunized mice survived the challenge and showed either reversible brain swelling and mild BBBD or no pathological signal alteration on MRI. Furthermore, less microglial activation was found in immunized mice compared to naive mice. However, along the rostral migratory stream microglial activation appeared to be similar in both groups. Distinct brain areas with higher parasite density could be observed in both groups, although parasite distribution was more disseminated in naive mice. By employing CLEM, we demonstrated that parasites have a high propensity towards the endothelium. In summary, we showed for the first time that reversible brain swelling also occurs in a mouse model of ECM by using advanced imaging techniques. We further identified hot spots of parasite accumulation and inflammation. This model may present a valuable tool to understand the mechanisms of reversible brain swelling in ECM. .",Excluded

LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Recognize the clinical manifestations of retinal artery occlusion LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Generate an age appropriate differential for retinal artery occlusion CASE: A 20 year-old healthy woman presented with acute left lower quadrant vision loss. She reported a similar episode 1 week prior after which her vision recovered, as well as a month-long history of left-sided temporal headaches associated with photosensitivity. Review of systems was positive for episodic paresthesias of bilateral forearms, hands, and feet. She denied constitutional symptoms, rash, joint pain, and drug use of any kind. Family history was remarkable for father with ocular migraine, and grandparents with rheumatoid arthritis and neurosarcoidosis. Exam revealed a left monocular lower quandrantanopsia, normal venous pulsations, no cherry red spot and a normal neurological exam. An extensive rheumatic and infectious workup was negative, including a hypercoaguability panel, antinuclear antibody, ESR, CRP, and hemoglobin evaluation. A brain MRI/MRA without contrast showed patent bilateral ophthalmic arteries. Face and neck MRI with contrast, transthoracic echocardiography with bubble study, electromyography, as well as nerve conduction studies were all unremarkable. Given the negative workup, the presumable etiology was thought to be vasospasm with migraine. She was started on low dose aspirin for secondary stroke prevention, and propranolol for migraine prophylaxis. IMPACT: This case highlights the clinical manifestations of retinal artery occlusion, as well as the possible etiologies of retinal artery occlusion. Workup should be tailored to an age appropriate differential. DISCUSSION: Overall, central and branch retinal artery occlusions (CRAO and BRAO) are rare with an incidence of approximately 1 to 10 in 100,000, with an affected mean age of 60-65 years. The etiology varies with age, with carotid artery atherosclerosis being most common overall, as high as 70%; however, for patients less than 40 years of age, cardiogenic embolism is much more likely. Therefore, workup for younger patients should be focused on evaluating for sources of cardiogenic embolism such as arrhythmias, murmurs, congenital heart disease, and substance abuse. For older patients, temporal arteritis should be ruled out. Vascular diseases such as fibromuscular dysplasia, radiation injury, or hematologic diseases including sickle cell anemia, hypercoagulable states, and hyperviscosity syndrome can affect all ages and should be investigated if other causes are excluded. Rare causes of CRAO/BRAO include infections due to Bartonella, toxoplasmosis, and varicella; ocular surgery; fat or amniotic fluid embolism; and vasospasm with or without migraine, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.

1881,"Guided imagery, anxiety, heart rate, and heart rate variability during centrifuge training. BACKGROUND: Centrifuge training is an important method of improving the hypergravity tolerance of pilots, cosmonauts, and Chinese astronauts. However, the concomitants of tension or anxiety often impede training. Guided imagery (GI), a mind-body relaxation technique, provides a behavioral and cognitive means whereby individuals are able to exert control over the focus of attention. This study aims to investigate the immediate effects of GI for reducing stress in centrifuge training.METHODS: There were 12 healthy young men who were randomly assigned to a GI group or music group. We measured changes in heart rate during centrifuge training, in heart rate variability before and after centrifuge training, and also evaluated relaxation and anxiety in three phases: before intervention, after intervention, and following centrifuge training.RESULTS: The change in the pattern of anxiety was different in the two groups over the three phases. Anxiety (measured by State Anxiety Inventory) in the GI group changed from 31.7 +/- 5.9 to 26.8 +/- 2.6 and 27.8 +/- 4.1, whereas for the music group this changed from 32.2 +/- 7.6 to 31.2 +/- 8.3 and 26.8 +/- 6.8. During centrifuge training, the maximal HR for the GI group (101.2 +/- 8.8) was lower than that of the music group (123.0 +/- 19.1). In addition GI showed a decrease in low frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) components and an increase in high frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz) components before and after centrifuge training.CONCLUSION: GI was capable of decreasing tension, anxiety, and sympathetic nervous system activity pre- or post-centrifugation.",Excluded

Recent studies place emphasis on the modulations of immune system in various psychiatric disorders and/or treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the implications of immune-related glial cells in a rapid-acting treatment for depression, namely, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Specifically, the effects of electroconvulsive shock (ECS; animal model of ECT) on microglia were morphologically determined in the mouse hippocampus by using ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) immunocytochemistry. For comparison, S100beta-positive astrocytes, another type of glial cells, were also tested. After 24 hours of acute ECS administration, a meshwork of Iba1-positive microglial processes was largely diminished, although the change was transient. In mice that received chronic ECS administration, the decline of Iba1-positive microglial process meshwork continued even 1 month after the last shock. Morphometric image analysis revealed the significant reduction of Iba1-positive microglial process density following ECS administration. On the other hand, neither acute nor chronic ECS administration made alterations in the patterns of expression of S100beta immunoreactivity. No significant changes were detected in the cell surface area of S100beta-positive astrocytes following ECS administration. The optical disector analysis demonstrated that ECS did not affect the numerical densities of Iba1-positive microglia and S100beta-positive astrocytes in the hippocampus. These results provide some key to understand the potential role of microglia and astrocytes in the antidepressant action of ECT.",Excluded

Two clinical trials are currently running at the Finnish dedicated boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) facility. Between May 1999 and December 2001, 18 patients with supratentorial glioblastoma were treated with boronophenylalanine (BPA)-based BNCT within a context of a prospective clinical trial (protocol P-01). All patients underwent prior surgery, but none had received conventional radiotherapy or cancer chemotherapy before BNCT. BPA-fructose was given as 2-h infusion at BPA-dosages ranging from 290 to 400 mg/kg prior to neutron beam irradiation, which was given as a single fraction from two fields. The average planning target volume dose ranged from 30 to 61 Gy (W), and the average normal brain dose from 3 to 6 Gy (W). The treatment was generally well tolerated, and none of the patients have died during the first months following BNCT. The estimated 1-year overall survival is 61%. In another trial (protocol P-03), three patients with recurring or progressing glioblastoma following surgery and conventional cranial radiotherapy to 50-60 Gy, were treated with BPA-based BNCT using the BPA dosage of 290 mg/kg. The average planning target dose in these patients was 25-29 Gy (W), and the average whole brain dose 2-3 Gy (W). All three patients tolerated brain reirradiation with BNCT, and none died during the first three months following BNCT. We conclude that BPA-based BNCT has been relatively well tolerated both in previously irradiated and unirradiated glioblastoma patients. Efficacy comparisons with conventional photon radiation are difficult due to patient selection and confounding factors such as other treatments given, but the results support continuation of clinical research on BPA-based BNCT.",Excluded
1884,"Late effects of intracranial radiation induces resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy that is partially reversible with CSF-1R inhibition. Primary and metastatic CNS malignancies remain incurable despite aggressive therapy with surgery and radiation. Immunotherapy has shown promise in many solid and hematologic malignancies, however, results have been disappointing in recurrent primary CNS tumors. Additionally, while upfront immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) has shown equal efficacy intracranially and extracranially, these responses are abrogated in previously irradiated brain lesions. Together, we hypothesize that radiation modulates the brain microenvironment to permit tumor growth and suppress anti-tumor immunity. As such, we developed a mouse model whereby orthotopic transplantation of murine gliomas into previously irradiated normal brain results in a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Moreover, the ICB-sensitive glioma cell line, GL261, is resistant to ICB therapy when implanted into a previously irradiated brain microenvironment. Immunophenotyping revealed a decreased ratio of CD8:CD4 T cells within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from previously irradiated mice though the relative frequency of neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells was slightly increased and no difference in PD-1 expression was observed. Alternatively, the frequency of microglia and tumor-infiltrating CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was increased following irradiation suggesting a potential role for these myeloid cells in the immunosuppressive effects noted. Consistently, the administration of a CSF-1R inhibitor, which has been shown to reduce the number of microglia and block MDSCs, partially resensitizes GL261 cells to ICB therapy. In summary, we have developed a model that recapitulates the late effects of radiation on immunotherapy-resistance in CNS tumors. Preliminary results suggest that these late radiation effects are mediated through an increased myeloid population, and that inhibition of these cell subsets via the CSF-1R pathway can partially restore efficacy of ICB therapy. Furthermore, this model may provide further insight into additional therapeutic strategies that can be used to overcome these mechanisms of resistance induced by radiation therapy in the CNS.",Excluded

An electrode with adjacent optical fibers for measurements during navigation and radio frequency lesioning in the brain is modeled for Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in brain tissue. Relative reflected light intensity at 780 nm, I780, from this electrode and probes with identical fiber configuration are simulated using the intensity from native white matter as reference. Models are made of homogeneous native and coagulated gray, thalamus, and white matter as well as blood. Dual layer models, including models with a layer of cerebrospinal fluid between the fibers and the brain tissue, are also made. Simulated I780 was 0.16 for gray matter, 0.67 for coagulate gray matter, 0.36 for thalamus, 0.39 for coagulated thalamus, unity for white matter, 0.70 for coagulated white matter, and 0.24 for blood. Thalamic matter is also found to reflect more light than gray matter and less than white matter in clinical studies. In conclusion, the reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between gray and white matter during navigation.

1889,"The future of radiation therapy in comprehensive cancer care. Cancer is a very challenging condition and one of the fastest growing health challenges in the developed world. As cancer is not one but hundredsof conditions it cannot be expected to be managed by one approach. The cellular, metabolic and genetic factors as well as location, stage and extent all contribute to the characterisation of the disease as well as the therapeutic approach. Radiation should be viewed as a very powerful therapeutic agent in the arsenal to combat cancer. New technological advances have given us tools to apply radiation in a variety of ways dependent on clinical situation. Increasing precision of the radiation therapy systems is creating a trend towards higher doses delivered over shorter time periods. The use of stereotactic techniques is becoming more common. This increased precision, facilitated by image guidance integrated with systems, is decreasing exposure to the healthy tissue and hence with reduced complications. From being viewed as palliative care, radiation therapy has transformed to being applied with a curative intention in many clinical situations. A case example is Leksell Gamma Knife that delivers high doses with pin-point accuracy to tumours in the brain. In Gamma Knife surgery the therapeutic dose is delivered in one session and image guidance relies on advanced MRI technologies. In brain metastase patients the treatment has the potential to significantly transform the outcome and management options for large patient groups, having breast and lung cancer as primary cancer disease. Technologies applied in modern cancer care are continuously evolving and we have seen how radiation protocols are being combined with other methods in integrated management approaches. By combining radiation with other modalities such as surgery as well as biological agents and drugs further improvement can be achieved. Future more comprehensive care processes require collaboration between specialties and information and communication become important features to be able to utilize the most cost effective treatment. In this paper the global utilization of RT is further discussed with an overview of some national and global examples how the care practice of RT has been evolving. Trends and recent advancement will be discussed as well as cost-effectiveness aspects of radiation therapy.

1892,"Restricting exposure to pulsed and broadband magnetic fields. A general procedure is described for application of the new ICNIRP exposure guidelines to pulsed and broadband magnetic fields below 100 kHz. The procedure involves weighting of the spectral components with a function that takes into account the basic restrictions and reference levels. A simple first-order RC response or its piecewise linear equivalent is proposed for the weighting function. The weighting can be performed either on the Fourier transformed sample of the measured signal or in real time by processing the signal with an analog or digital filter circuit. The cut-off frequency of the filter is 820 Hz. The occupational exposure criteria are exceeded when the weighted peak magnetic flux density exceeds 43 microT or equivalently the weighted peak dB/dt exceeds 0.22 T s(-1). The maximal peak exposures allowed by the proposed approach are compared with the stimulation thresholds computed with a stimulation model. The results strongly suggest that the safety margin to the stimulation is greater for non-sinusoidal than for sinusoidal waveforms, and at low frequencies it is higher than at high frequencies. The increase of the low-frequency safety margin is desirable to avoid magnetophosphenes and possible CNS effects that may occur below the level predicted by the classical nerve models. Measurement techniques and examples of measured magnetic fields are presented. Particularly high exposures were measured inside MRI equipment and anti-theft gates.",Excluded

Intrinsic properties and rotation-evoked responses of trochlear motoneurons were investigated in the turtle using an in vitro preparation consisting of the brain stem with attached temporal bones that retain functional semicircular canals. Motoneurons were divided into two classes based on intrinsic properties. The first class exhibited higher impedance (123.0 +/- 11.0 MOmega), wider spikes (0.99 +/- 0.05 ms), a single spike afterhyperpolarization (AHP), little or no spike frequency adaptation (SFA), and anomalous rectification, characterized by an initial ""sag"" in membrane potential in response to hyperpolarizing current injection. The second class exhibited lower impedance (21.8 +/- 2.5 MOmega), narrower spikes (0.74 +/- 0.03 ms), a double AHP, substantial SFA, and little or no rectification. Vestibular responses were evoked by horizontal sinusoidal rotation (1/12-1/3 Hz; peak velocity: 30-100 degrees /s). Spiking in higher-impedance cells was recruited earlier in the response and exhibited a more limited dynamic range relative to that of lower impedance cells. Spiking evoked by injecting depolarizing current during rotation was blocked during contraversive motion and was consistent with a shunting inhibition. No morphological features were identified in neurobiotin-filled cells that correlated with the two physiological classes. Recovered motoneurons were multipolar but exhibited a less-complex dendritic morphology than ocular motoneurons of similarly sized mammals.

Aim: A robust tool is required for the dosimetric verification of high dose small fields associated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (SRT). The response characteristics of EBT3 have been determined for the high dose range. The application of the film in SRS/SRT quality assurance testing has been evaluated. Method(s): The response characteristics of EBT3 (Lot# 07221303) were examined using an Epson Expression 10000XL flatbed scanner in combination with ImageJ and RIT software. Red, green and blue channel responses were analysed for 0-40 Gy. Green channel inter and intra film uniformity, dose rate dependence and post exposure darkening were characterised at high doses. Film uniformity was compared using two films from the same batch, each divided into 16 equal pieces and irradiated with 15 Gy. The characterisation was complemented by verifying a cranial SRS treatment with the film positioned in a LucyTM phantom. Result(s): The dose response curves of the three colour channels were compared across a 0-40 Gy dose range. Green channel analysis was found to be optimal for doses above 10 Gy due to its wider dynamic range. The dose response curves of two 6 MV beams delivered at 1000 MU/min and 600 MU/min rep rate across a 0-40 Gy dose range were found to agree with a maximum variation of 1.3%. The postirradiation darkening of EBT3 for 10, 15 and 25 Gy was determined. The dose distribution of an iPlanTM SRS treatment was verified.

She had previously been evaluated at an urgent care facility where she was given a course of steroids for her symptoms. Although she had brief improvement with prednisone, her symptoms returned after the course ended. She denied any other systemic symptoms specifically weight loss, fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, or change in bowel habits. She had recently noticed darkening of her urine and possible jaundice, but stated this seemed to be improving. Her physical exam was notable for jaundice without evidence of chronic liver disease. Her abdomen was soft , non-tender, and she had no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation showed AST 166 IU/L, ALT 90 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.4 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase of 401 IU/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse dilation of intrahepatic ducts and a 1.5-cm common bile duct (CBD), as well as 4.8 x 6.7 cm heterogeneous mass in the gallbladder with a second similarly enhancing lesion seen at the distal CBD. The pancreas appeared normal. An ERCP was performed which revealed a polypoid appearing mass within the distal bile duct. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed and this was biopsied after eversion into the duodenal lumen. Initial differential included biliary cystadenoma/ adenocarcinoma versus atypical cholangiocarcinoma versus lymphoma or IPMN of the bile ducts. However, biopsy specimen showed pigmented deposition on H&E stain with subsequent positive staining for S-100 and HMB proteins consistent with melanoma. Unfortunately, a staging MRI of the brain showed evidence of metastatic lesions. Thorough skin, eye, and mucosal examination did not reveal evidence of a primary lesion, and a CT-PET scan showed large, hypermetabolic lesions in the gallbladder and distal bile duct without evidence of other primary source. Therefore, our final diagnosis is primary biliary melanoma with metastatic disease to the brain. Only 10 other cases of primary biliary melanoma have been reported in the literature to date. Mortality is based on stage of disease at presentation with surgical resection providing the best chance for survival.

Our study recruited asymptomatic, high-risk smokers, 55-74 years of age from primary care clinics in an academic urban hospital. Guided by the self-regulation theory, we evaluated cognitive and affective beliefs about lung cancer. Intention to screen for lung cancer with a CT scan was assessed by self-report. We used univariate and logistic regression analyses to compare beliefs about screening and intention to screen among minority (Blacks and Hispanics) and non-minority participants. Overall, we enrolled 108 participants, of which 40% were Black and 34% were Hispanic; the mean age was 62.3 years, and median pack-years of smoking was 26. We found that intention to screen was similar among minorities and non-minorities (p=0.19); however, Hispanics were less likely to report intention to screen if they had to pay for the test (p=0.02). Fatalistic beliefs, fear of radiation exposure, and anxiety related to CT scans were significantly associated with decreased intention to screen (p<0.05). Several differences were observed in minority versus non-minority participants' beliefs toward lung cancer and screening. In conclusion, we found that concerns about cost, which were particularly prominent among Hispanics, as well as fatalism and radiation exposure fears may constitute barriers to lung cancer screening.

Cachexia is a clinical wasting syndrome that occurs in multiple disease states, and is associated with anorexia and a progressive loss of body fat and lean mass. The development of new therapeutics for this disorder is needed due to poor efficacy and multiple side effects of current therapies. The pivotal role played by the central melanocortin system in regulating body weight has made this an attractive target for novel cachexia therapies. The mixed melanocortin receptor antagonist AgRP is an endogenous peptide that induces hyperphagia. Here, we used AgRP(83-132) to investigate the ability of melanocortin antagonism to protect against clinical features of cachexia in two distinct animal models. In an acute model, food intake and body weight gain were reduced in mice exposed to radiation (300 RAD), and delivery of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral cerebral ventricle prevented these effects. In a chronic tumor cachexia model, adult mice were injected subcutaneously with a cell line derived from murine colon-26 adenocarcinoma. Typical of cachexia, tumor-bearing mice progressively reduced body weight and food intake, and gained significantly less muscle mass than controls. Administration of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral ventricles significantly increased body weight and food intake, and changes in muscle mass were similar to the tumor-free control mice. These findings support the idea that antagonism of the central melanocortin system can reduce the negative impact of cachexia and radiation therapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1900,"Impact of gallium-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT on management of neuroendocrine tumors. Methods Overall 40 patients (25 men and 15 women, age: 50+/-9 years) with clinical / biochemical suspicion or histologicaly proven Neuroendocrine tumors underwent <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT. 21 patients (52.5%) came with recently diagnosed primary NET. 17 patients (42.5%) presented with NET metastases from carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUPS). 2 patients presented with raised gastrin levels. Results Ga-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT showed sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 92.5%, respectively, for primary tumor and 98.5% and 100% for metastases. It was better than a conventional imaging modality for the detection of both primary tumor (p < 0.001) and metastases (p < 0.0001). It changed the management strategy in 22 patients (55%). On the basis of the results, 11 patients (27.5%) underwent surgery for primary lesions for surgically resectable loco regional disease. Five patients (12.5 %) detected with advanced stage of disease on PET were spared unnecessary surgery. Six patients (15%) with poor 68Ga-DOTA-NOC uptake were spared unnecessary octreotide therapy and were started on systemic chemotherapy. In addition, the detection of the expression of somatostatin receptors led to octreotide-based treatments in 25 patients. Conclusions 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT provides incremental diagnostic information compared to conventional imaging. It has significant impact in management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Extent of disease defined by Ga-68-DOTA-NOC PET/CT can alter the surgical management of these patients. The detection of a high degree of somatostatin receptor expression can be exploited to treat patients with octreotide therapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and, conversely, a negative finding on 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/ CT can guide the treating physician to choose an alternate form of treatment. Additional benefit of 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT include patient convenience with short time acquisition and lower radiation exposure signifying the important role of 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET CT in clinical practice of neuroendocrine malignancies.",Excluded

1902,"Macro to microdosimetric analysis for alpha particle radiopharmaceutical therapy for [<sup>211</sup>at]YC-I-27, a PSMA-targeting ligand for metastatic prostate cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a human transmembrane protein that is overexpressed 1000-fold in human prostate cancers (PC) and is internalized upon binding of ligands, making it an attractive target for radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). The expression of PSMA in normal tissues is limited to the prostate, brain and proximal kidney tubules. The purpose of this study was to perform a dosimetric analysis for the high-affinity PSMA-targeting ligand YC-I-27 labeled with the alpha particle emitter <sup>211</sup>At, to evaluate its possible use in alpha-RPT for metastatic PC. Materials/Methods: Mice bearing PSMA+ PC3 PIP and PSMA- PC3 flu xenografts were injected intravenously with 100 mCi of [<sup>211</sup>At]YC-I-27 and sacrificed 1 and 4 h post injection. The kidneys and tumors were harvested and measured for whole-organ/tumor dosimetry, after which, the tissues were frozen and cryosectioned for histology and alpha-Camera imaging. The alpha-Camera, a digital autoradiography imaging technology for detecting alpha particles in ex vivo tissue samples, was used to determine the distribution and activity concentration of [<sup>211</sup>At]YC-I-27 within the tissues. Whole-organ/tumor dosimetry was performed in combination with small scale sub organ/tumor dosimetry based on the alpha-Camera and histological images. Result(s): The highest uptake of [<sup>211</sup>At]YC-I-27 was 4 h post injection in the kidneys and PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumors with 98 and 40%ID/g, respectively. The whole-organ/tumor mean absorbed dose to the kidneys and PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumors were 37 and 14 mGy/kBq, respectively. The alpha-Camera images showed a heterogeneous distribution of the radioactivity with concentrations up to 5 times higher within the kidney cortex compared with the kidney average; PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumors exhibited selective uptake of [<sup>211</sup>At]YC-I-27 20-fold more compared with that of PSMA- PC3 flu tumors. The radioactivity distributions within the PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumors were overall homogenous with areas with 3-4.5 times higher concentrations than the tumor average, possibly due to uneven distribution of vasculature and necrosis within the tumors. Conclusion(s): alpha-RPT targeted to PSMA is considered as a promising treatment modality for metastatic PC, and the use of small-scale modeling combined with macro-to-micro conversion is essential to understanding alpha particle dosimetry and relating macroscopically measured activities to micro-scale absorbed doses. The PSMA-specific high tumor uptake combined with high linear energy transfer of the alpha particles confirms its therapeutic potential, and uptake in the kidneys suggests this is likely to be the dose limiting normal tissue.",Excluded
1903,"CNS effects of heavy particle irradiation in space: behavioral implications. Research from several sources indicates that young (3 mo) rats exposed to heavy particle irradiation (56Fe irradiation) produces changes in motor behavior as well as alterations in neuronal transmission similar to those seen in aged (22-24 mo) rats. These changes are specific to neuronal systems that are affected by aging. Since 56Fe particles make up approximately 1-2% of cosmic rays, these findings suggest that the neuronal effects of heavy particle irradiation on long-term space flights may be significant, and may even supercede subsequent mutagenic effects in their mission capabilities. It is suggested that among other methods, it may be possible to utilize nutritional modification procedures to offset the putative deleterious effects of these particles in space.",Included
1904,"Intraoperative pulmonary embolism during craniotomy: A case report. Background: Acute intraoperative pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious, yet rare, life-threatening event that requires swift diagnosis and intervention. Rudolf Virchow first described his famous triad of risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) >100 years ago and it remains relevant today: venous stasis, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulable state.1 Further, there is up to a 5-fold increase in the incidence of PE in the perioperative period.1 We present a case of intraoperative pulmonary embolism in a patient with known risk factors while undergoing craniotomy for tumor resection for recurrent malignancy. Case Presentation: A 52-year-old male with a history of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) status post prior resection, chemotherapy, and radiation, GERD, HTN, and obesity presented for tumor resection. Per clinical trial, patient could not receive any medications that affected CYP3A4. Twenty minutes after induction, patient started to display hemodynamic instability and had hypoxemic episodes that responded, initially, to recruitment breath maneuvers. At that time, a baseline ABG was drawn that revealed a large PaCO<inf>2</inf> end-tidal CO<inf>2</inf> gradient, which raised suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolus. Shortly thereafter, hemodynamic instability ensued, and patient was up-titrated on vasopressors: phenylephrine, then norepinephrine and epinephrine. Surgery was aborted before entering the cranial vault, and interventional radiology (IR) was contacted. Patient was transported to IR for catheterization of pulmonary arteries and was found to have massive bilateral pulmonary embolisms and subsequently systemically heparinized. Infusion catheters were placed in bilateral arteries, and tPa boluses were started for clot lysis. After boluses, patient regained some hemodynamic stability, but remained on high-dose vasopressor infusions. Bilateral infusion catheters were left in place, patient was transported to neurosurgical ICU on norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin infusions, and nitric oxide was started. Overnight, patient was weaned off norepinephrine, and oxygenation and ventilation improved. He remained on nitric oxide and catheter-directed thrombolysis. Despite cardiopulmonary improvement, patient's family elected to withdraw care given his poor prognosis with or without tumor resection. Discussion(s): An increase in alveolar dead space is associated with pulmonary thromboembolism with high sensitivity and specificity in surgical patients,1 in addition to cardiopulmonary compromise. Studies have shown a statistically significant reduction in mortality in patients with major PE who received directed thrombolysis compared with systemic heparin alone.1 Regardless of intervention, mortality in hemodynamically unstable patients with PE remains as high as 30%.2.",Excluded

D609 (tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate) is a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C inhibitor that also has been reported to protect rodents against oxidative damage caused by lethal doses of ionizing radiation. We previously showed that D609 mimics glutathione. D609 has a free thiol group, which upon oxidation forms a disulfide. The resulting dixanthate is a substrate for glutathione reductase, regenerating D609. Recent studies from our laboratory have also shown that D609 reduces the Alzheimer amyloid beta-peptide (1-42)-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in neuronal cell culture. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that D609 would provide neuroprotection against free radical oxidative stress in vivo. Synaptosomes isolated from gerbils, previously injected intraperitoneally (ip) with D609, were treated with the oxidants Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> or 2,2-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), which produce free radicals.

1906,"Impact of brain tumors and radiotherapy on the presence of gadolinium in the brain after repeated administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents: an experimental study in rats. PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations induced by an experimental tumor and radiotherapy on MRI signal intensity (SI) in deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and the presence of gadolinium after repeated administration of a linear gadolinium-based contrast agent in rats.METHODS: Eighteen Fischer rats were divided into a tumor (gliosarcoma, GS9L model), a radiotherapy, and a control group. All animals received 5 daily injections (1.8 mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine. For tumor-bearing animals, the BBB disruption was confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI. Animals from the tumor and radiation group underwent radiotherapy in 6 fractions of 5 Gray. The SI ratio between DCN and brain stem was evaluated on T1-weigthed MRI at baseline and 1 week after the last administration. Subsequently, the brain was dissected for gadolinium quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was done with the Kruskal-Wallis test.RESULTS: An increased but similar DCN/brain stem SI ratio was found for all three groups (p = 0.14). The gadolinium tissue concentrations (median, nmol/g) were 6.7 (tumor), 6.3 (radiotherapy), and 6.8 (control) in the cerebellum (p = 0.64) and 17.8/14.6 (tumor), 20.0/18.9 (radiotherapy), and 17.8/15.9 (control) for the primary tumor (p = 0.98) and the contralateral hemisphere (p = 0.41) of the cerebrum, respectively.CONCLUSION: An experimental brain tumor treated by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone did not alter DCN signal hyperintensity and gadolinium concentration in the rat brain 1 week after repeated administration of gadopentetate. This suggests that a local BBB disruption does not affect the amount of retained gadolinium in the brain.",Included

1909,"NF-kappa B signaling pathway as a target for human tumor radiosensitization. NF-kappa B is a critical nuclear transcriptional factor that is activated in response to cellular stresses and regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and cell death. When regulated NF-kappa B activation is disrupted, cells undergo apoptosis. That is, constitutively elevated or dysregulated NF-kappa B activation leads to cell death in response to stress. These mechanisms have been shown experimentally by expressing dominant negative inhibitors of NF-kappa B (I kappa B-alpha) in cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutic agents or to ionizing radiation. NF-kappa B also plays an important role in a novel, radiation-inducible signaling pathway that involves the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase. Cells from patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation and exhibit impaired NF-kappa B activation in response to this stress. Restoration of NF-kappa B regulation in AT fibroblasts by introducing a dominant negative form of I kappa B-alpha has resulted in correction of radiation sensitivity and a reduction of ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. Expression of introduced ATM in AT cells results in correction of NF-kappa B regulation and an increase in postradiation survival without reduction in radiation-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these observations support a central role for NF-kappa B regulation in cellular intrinsic radiation sensitivity and apoptosis after exposure to ionizing radiation. Therefore, we hypothesize that the signaling pathway involving ATM/NF-kappa B/I kappa B offers attractive potential molecular targets for radiation sensitization in strategies to enhance the therapeutic ratio in cancer treatment.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: The RTOG 9402 trial reported an improved Outcome in IDH mutant and 1p19q-codeleted anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors after chemotherapy (CT) with radiotherapy (RT). We evaluated the efficacy of CT and RT in patients with IDH mutant, 1p19q-noncodeleted secondary high-grade astrocytoma (sHGA) WHO grades III and IV. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment data from 109 patients with sHGA grades III and IV, developed from histologically confirmed low-grade astrocytoma grade II were retrospectively analyzed. IDH mutation-, 1p19q/codeletion- and MGMT-promoter methylation status were evaluable in all patients. Progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) in relation to adjuvant treatment modalities and molecular profiling were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULT(S): Out of 109 patients, 88 patients (80.7%) harbored an IDH1 or 2 mutations, 30 patients a 1p19q-codeletion (27.5%), and 63 patients (57.8%) exhibited a methylated MGMT-promoter status. During the follow-up time 57 patients (52.2%) died. The postsurgical treatment for the 88 IDH mutant sHGA included: RT alone in 17 patients (19.3%), a combined RT and CT (RCT) in 48 patients (54.5%) and CT alone in 20 patients (22.7%). 3 patients did not receive any adjuvant treatment due to bad neurological conditions. At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, the median OS of all IDH mutant sHGA was 5.67 years (1.9-17.4 years). The OS in patients who received RCT was 6.4 years, which is significantly longer compared with those who underwent RT alone (1.2 years, hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.32-0.51. p = 0.011). After including only IDH mutant sHGA patients without a 1p19q-codeletion, the Kaplan-Meier curves estimates a significantly improved OS in the RCT cohort (33 patients) in comparison to patients who received RT alone (10 patients) (6.4 vs 1.2 years, hazard ratio 0.4, 95% CI 0.34-0.6, p= 0.022).

1912,"Safety of 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a well-characterized hemoglobinopathy affecting more than 20 million individuals worldwide and carries an increased risk of cerebral vasculopathy, cerebral infarct, and stroke. As mechanisms of cerebral infarction in SCD are partly attributable to microvascular vaso-occlusive crises, manifesting as altered cerebral blood flow and associated impaired oxygen delivery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods that can quickly provide a comprehensive perspective on structural and functional disease status, without exogenous contrast administration or ionizing radiation, have emerged as crucial clinical tools for surveillance. However, early ex vivo MRI work in suspended erythrocytes containing hemoglobin S at 0.35 Tesla (T) suggested that sickled erythrocytes can orient preferentially in the presence of an external magnetic field, and as such, it was suggested that MRI exams in sickle cell hemoglobinopathy could induce vaso-occlusion. While this observation has generally not impacted clinical imaging in individuals with SCD, it has led to resistance for some sickle cell studies within the engineering community among some imaging scientists as this early observation has never been rigorously shown to be unconcerning. Here, we performed MRI at the clinical field strength of 3 T in 172 patients with SCD, which included standard anatomical and angiographic assessments together with gold standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; spatial resolution = 1.8 x 1.8 x 4 mm; b-value = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) for acute infarct assessment (performed approximately 20 min after patient introduction to the field isocenter).

These findings are consistent with 3 T MRI not inducing acute infarction or vaso-occlusion in individuals with SCD and suggest that earlier low-field ex vivo work of erythrocytes in suspension is not a sufficient cause to discourage MRI scans in patients with SCD.",Excluded

Purpose: It is well known that an intracranial non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCT), especially poor prognosis group which demonstrated high level of serum tumor marker has poor prognosis due to CSF dissemination or local recurrence. The objective of this study was to determine whether the combination of surgery and intensive chemotherapy was effective in patients with poor prognosis group of intracranial NGGCT. Patient(s): Since 1998, we have had 24 patients with an intracranial NGGCT. These consisted of an intermediate group (IG) with 10 cases, and a poor group (PG) with 14 cases. NAT (neo-adjuvant therapy), which is preceding chemotherapy before surgery, was performed in 11 cases which presented with serum b-HCG of over 500 mIU/ml or AFP 500 ng/ml and a reduced teratoma component in neuro-imagings. Radical surgery was done in another 13 cases. The chemotherapy regimen was CARE (carboplatin, etoposide) for IG. Since 2006, we have shifted the chemotherapy from ICE regimen (ifosfamide, cisplatin, etoposide) (8 cases) to the JCO2004 regimen (cisplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, carboplatin) (6 cases) to strengthen chemotherapy for PG followed by reduced dose of radiation. Result(s): The total follow-up period was 6.7 years. Two patients showed rapid tumor growth after chemotherapy in so called ""growing teratoma syndrome."" Four patients in NAT (40%) demonstrated complete remission after only chemotherapy. In PG, five of eight in ICE (62%) died (recurrence: 4, radiation induced glioblastoma: 1), none showed tumor recurrence in the JCO 2004 regimen. All patients in IG survived without tumor recurrence.

Acute flank pain is a frequent clinical presentation encountered in emergency departments, and a work-up for obstructive urolithiasis in this setting is a common indication for computed tomography (CT). However, imaging alternatives to CT for the evaluation of renal colic are warranted in some clinical situations, such as younger patients, pregnancy, patients that have undergone multiple prior CT exams and also patients with vague clinical presentations. MRI, although relatively insensitive for the direct detection of urinary calculi, has the ability to detect the secondary effects of obstructive urolithiasis. Using rapid, single shot T2-weighted sequences without and with fat saturation provides an abdominopelvic MR examination that can detect the sequelae of clinically active stone disease, in addition to alternate inflammatory processes that may mimic the symptoms of renal colic. In addition, MR nephro-urography (MRNU) has the ability to provide quantitative analysis of renal function that has the potential to direct clinical management in the setting of obstructing calculi.

1925,"Severed corticospinal axons recover electrophysiologic control of muscle activity after x-ray therapy in lesioned adult spinal cord. Mechanical injury to the adult mammalian spinal cord results in permanent loss of structural integrity at the lesion site and of the brain-controlled function distal to the lesion. Some of these consequences were permanently averted by altering the cellular constituents at the lesion site with x-irradiation delivered within a critical time window after injury. We have reported in a separate article that x-irradiation of sectioned adult rat spinal cord resulted in restitution of structural continuity and regrowth of severed corticospinal axons across and deep into the distal stump. Here, we report that after x-ray therapy of the lesion site severed corticospinal axons of transected adult rat spinal cord recover electrophysiologic control of activity of hindlimb muscles innervated by motoneurons distal to the lesion. The degree of recovery of control of muscle activity was directly related to the degree of restitution of structural integrity. This restitution of electrophysiologic function implies that the regenerating corticospinal axons reestablish connectivity with neurons within the target field in the distal stump. Our data suggest that recovery of structural continuity is a sufficient condition for the axotomized corticospinal neurons to regain some of their disrupted function in cord regions distal to the lesion site.",Included

1928,"Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance features of gynecologic abnormalities in women presenting with acute or chronic abdominal pain. Advances in technology and improved availability have led to increased use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate women presenting to the emergency department or to their primary care provider with abdominal and/or pelvic pain. Computed tomographic examinations are often performed to evaluate the presence of appendicitis or renal stone disease. However, gynecologic abnormalities are frequently identified on these examinations. Although ultrasound remains the primary modality by which complaints specific to the pelvis are evaluated, in many instances, CT and MRI imaging occurs before sonographic evaluation.Historically, because of cost, radiation exposure, and relative ease of use, ultrasound examinations have preceded all other imaging modalities when evaluating pelvic disorders. However, as CT and MRI technology have improved, their use in diagnosing causes of pelvic pain has become equal to that of ultrasound. In some cases, primarily because of historic comfort with sonographic evaluation, gynecologic abnormalities originally diagnosed on CT or MRI may be immediately and unnecessarily reevaluated by ultrasound. For a woman in her reproductive years, the most common adnexal masses are physiological cysts, endometriomas, and cystic teratomas. Although lesions are often asymptomatic and incidentally detected, they can present with pain, and they increase the risk of ovarian torsion. Common causes of chronic pelvic pain in this population include leiomyomata and adenomyosis. In postmenopausal women, ovarian carcinoma, which often does not present clinically until a late stage, has to be included in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. If a gynecologic pathology is discovered on CT or MRI, an immediate follow-up ultrasound need not be pursued if the lesion can be characterized as benign, needing immediate surgical intervention, or a variant of normal anatomy. If, on the other hand, findings demonstrate a mass that either is uncharacteristic of a benign lesion, has an indeterminate risk for malignancy, or demonstrates suspicious characteristics for malignancy (such as enhancing mural nodules), further evaluation by serial ultrasound, biochemical marker, and/or CT or MRI is warranted. The purpose of this review is to present a series of commonly encountered gynecologic abnormalities with either CT or MR to make radiologists more familiar with gynecologic pathology on CT and MRI.

1929,"Localization dependent sensitivity of cerebral Na,K-ATPase to irradiation induced oxidative imbalance in rats. Na,K-ATPase represents the key enzyme maintaining the ionic gradient across plasma membrane. It was documented that in directly irradiated organs the activity of this enzyme is decreased. The aim of present study was to clarify the remote effect of irradiation in mediastinal area on the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in selected brain regions in rats. Ionizing radiation in single dose 25 Gy induced alterations in oxidative status of blood plasma. Irradiation also decreased the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in cerebral cortex. Measurements of kinetic properties of the enzyme dependently on the concentration of energy substrate ATP or cofactor Na<sup>+</sup> indicated that the lowered enzyme activity is probably a consequence of decreased number of active molecules of the enzyme, as suggested by lowered V<sub>max</sub> values (by 13 - 14%). Immunoblot analysis revealed that this effect is connected namely to decreased presence of alpha2 and alpha3 subunits (by 25% and 30% respectively). Considering the current concepts about involvement of the malfunction of alpha2 alpha3 subunits in development of primary brain dysfunctions, it may be hypothesized that the lowered functionality of those subunits of Na,K-ATPase may represent a predisposition to neurodegenerative disorders after irradiation. The observed effect seems to be localization dependent as the enzyme in cerebellum resisted to irradiation.",Included
1930,"Oxidative damage to mitochondria in normal and cancer tissues, and its modulation. Cellular damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in normal tissues has been implicated in the etiology of several human ailments. Among the subcellular organelles, damage to mitochondria is considered crucial and can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death. However, the same damage, if it is selectively induced in cancer tissues can lead to its cure. Hence analyzing the mechanisms of such damage and its modulation may result in better prevention or cure. Using mitochondria derived from rat brain/liver as well as sarcoma 180 ascites cells, we have examined the mechanisms of damage to lipid, as assessed by different products of lipid peroxidation and to proteins, as determined by loss of enzyme activity and protein oxidation. Mechanisms involved, in terms of scavenging of ROS have been determined using pulse radiolysis for hydroxyl radical and histidine destruction assay for singlet oxygen. Various ROS were generated using gamma-radiation, photosensitization etc. under different conditions. Some novel porphyrins, with potential uses in photodynamic therapy also were used as photosensitizers. Our study shows that ROS can induce significant oxidative damage in mitochondria from both normal and tumor tissues and this can be inhibited by natural antioxidants like tocotrienols, nicotinamide and caffeine. Damage, on the other hand, can be enhanced by deuteration of the buffer and oxygenation. Our results hence demonstrated that mitochondria were sensitive to damage by ROS and its modulation may have potential uses in prevention of the disease in normal tissues; if damage can be selectively induced in tumor, it can lead to its regression.",Excluded

1933,"Tryptophan pet has a strong prognostic value in post-treatment high-grade gliomas. BACKGROUND: MRI has limited prognostic value in patients with previously treated high-grade gliomas. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with alpha[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT), a radiotracer tracking tryptophan transport and metabolism via the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway, can accurately differentiate glioma recurrence from radiation injury (J Nucl Med 2012;53:1058-64). We evaluated AMT uptake as a prognostic marker for survival in post-treatment patients with high-grade glioma. METHOD(S): AMT-PET was performed in 39 patients > 1 month (median: 325 days) after resection and chemoradiation of a grade III or IV astrocytic glioma. All patients were followed for at least 1 year or until death after PET. Maximum standardized uptake values (AMT-SUVmax) were measured in brain regions suspicious for tumor on MRI. Unidirectional AMT uptake (K) was also quantified from dynamic PETand blood radioactivity data (available in 34 cases). Optimal cutoff thresholds for prediction of 1-year survival were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and survival of patients with above vs. below threshold values was evaluated in thewhole group, and in two subgroups (glioblastoma [n = 33], no further surgical or radiation treatment after PET [n = 22]). RESULT(S): For 1-year survival, sensitivity/specificity was 84%/80% for AMT-SUVmax and 76%/88% for lesion/cortex K-ratio, when using ROC-defined cutoff thresholds. Both AMT-SUVmax and K-ratio were highly prognostic for survival in all patient groups. Estimated median survival after PET was 966 and 876 days in the low, vs. 177 days in both the high AMT-SUVmax and high K-ratio groups, respectively (log-rank: p, > 001). Age- and gradecorrected Cox regression analyses showed a robust association between high AMT values and shorter overall survival after the PET scan (SUVmax: OR= 6.2 [2.2-17.5], K-ratio: OR= 6.6 [2.3-18.6]; p<= > 001).

A 73-year-old male was admitted with right-sided motor weakness and presented with a rare association of incidental venous malformation in the right frontal lobe and a glioblastoma in the left frontal lobe. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging failed to demonstrate typical appearance of venous malformation and showed atypical findings surrounding the suspected vascular lesion. Angiography was needed to obtain the diagnosis of venous malformation. The patient underwent subtotal resection of the glioblastoma and received radiation therapy. The venous malformation was followed up conservatively because it was asymptomatic. Correct diagnosis of coexisting venous malformation is important for the treatment of an associated brain tumor, especially when both lesions are closely located. [References: 16]",Excluded
1935,"Radiation dose reduction using real-time image processing in interventional radiology. Purpose: To characterize changes in radiation dose after introducing a new real-time image processing technology in interventional radiology systems. Method(s): Interventional radiology (IR) procedures are increasingly complex, at times requiring substantial time and radiation dose. The risk of inducing tissue reactions as well as long-term stochastic effects such as radiation-induced cancer is not trivial. To reduce this risk, IR systems are increasingly equipped with dose reduction technologies. Recently, ClarityIQ (Philips Healthcare) technology was installed in our existing neuroradiology IR (NIR) and vascular IR (VIR) suites respectively. ClarityIQ includes realtime image processing that reduces noise/artifacts, enhances images, and sharpens edges while also reducing radiation dose rates. We reviewed 412 NIR (175 pre-and 237 post-ClarityIQ) procedures and 329 VIR (156 preand 173 post-ClarityIQ) procedures performed at our institution pre-and post-ClarityIQ implementation. NIR procedures were primarily classified as interventional or diagnostic. VIR procedures included drain port, drain placement, tube change, mesenteric, and implanted venous procedures. Air Kerma (AK in units of mGy) was documented for all the cases using a commercial radiation exposure management system. Result(s): When considering all NIR procedures, median AK decreased from 1194 mGy to 561 mGy. When considering all VIR procedures, median AK decreased from 49 to 14 mGy. Both NIR and VIR exhibited a decrease in AK exceeding 50% after ClarityIQ implementation, a statistically significant (p<0.05) difference. Of the 5 most common VIR procedures, all median AK values decreased, but significance (p<0.05) was only reached in venous access (N=53), angio mesenteric (N=41), and drain placement procedures (N=31). Conclusion(s): ClarityIQ can reduce dose significantly for both NIR and VIR procedures. Image quality was not assessed in conjunction with the dose reduction.",Excluded
1936,"Salvage craniospinal irradiation for recurrent germinomas. BACKGROUND: The treatment strategies for recurrence has not been established. PURPOSE: To clarify the tumor control and complications of salvage craniospinal irradiation (CSI) for recurrent germinoma. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the medical record. Among 153 germinomas treated in Tohoku University Hospital since 1983, 22 had recurrence of germinoma. At first recurrence, 7 cases received CSI, whereas 15 cases did chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy other than craniospinal field (non- CSI). CSI was performed at 24 Gy/ 12 fractions or 30 Gy/ 25 fractions. RESULT(S): CSI had statistically significant better recurrence-free survival rate after recurrence than non-CSI (100% vs 33%, p<0.001: log-rank test). In addition, tumor control was obtained in all of four cases with the failure after non- CSI treatments for recurrence. The late complications of these 11 cases were examined. The local dose before CSI was 24- 50 Gy, and the median interval from last irradiation to CSI was 33 months. Median follow- up period after CSI was 126 months. Three patients developed newly developed visual or cognitive deficits. These patients received high-dose irradiation at initial treatment or multiple treatment before CSI. There were no late complications in the cases which had prior chemotherapy and 24 Gy of irradiation to whole ventricle only before CSI. CONCLUSION(S): Low dose CSI for the first recurrence of germinoma is effective and safe in the cases treated by chemotherapy and low dose irradiation to whole ventricle only.",Excluded
1937,"Terrestrial isopods congregate under a low-level beta-emitter source. Ionizing radiation is ubiquitous, but very few experiments have investigated the biological effects of the natural background radiation at very low doses (>10 mGy/yr). We examined whether the background radiation, or radiation of a slightly higher level, has a role in evoking changes in behaviors of terrestrial isopods (woodlice). Upon exposure to a source giving 15 times the background level placed at one end of a box, a significant increase in the number of woodlice gathering under the beta-source was observed with time, as compared with the sham control. Terrestrial isopods have chemoreceptors (the olfactory system) on the terminal segment of their antennae. An additional experiment confirmed the involvement of these antennae in the radiation effect on behavior. After the excision of the antennae, no beta-taxis response was observed. The behavior of the group exposed to the source giving 30 times the background tended to decrease gradually in the area of the source, and the individuals aggregated in the area away from the source. Thus, the olfactory sensor in the antennae may be an important organ involved in the prompt response to radiation exposure, and the discrimination of the radiation field strengths of radioisotopes.",Included

Exposure of rats to 1-15 Gy gamma radiation (<sup>60</sup>Co) induced hyperthermia, whereas 20-200 Gy induced hypothermia. Exposure either to the head or the whole body to 10 Gy induced hyperthermia, while body-only exposure produced hypothermia. This observation indicates that radiation-induced fever is a result of a direct effect on the brain. The hyperthermia due to 10 Gy was significantly attenuated by the pre- or post-treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Hyperthermia was also altered by the central administration of a mu-receptor antagonist naloxone but only at low doses of radiation. These findings suggest that radiation-induced hyperthermia may be mediated through the synthesis and release of prostaglandins in the brain and to a lesser extent to the release of endogenous opioid peptides. The release of histamine acting on H<inf>1</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> receptors may be involved in radiation-induced hypothermia, since both the H<inf>1</inf> receptor antagonist, mepyramine, and H<inf>2</inf> receptor antagonist, cimetidine, antagonized the hypothermia. The results of these studies suggest that the release of neurohumoral substances induced by exposure to ionizing radiation is dose dependent and has different consequences on physiological processes such as the regulation of body temperature. Furthermore, the antagonism of radiation-induced hyperthermia by indomethacin may have potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of fever resulting from accidental irradiations.",Included

While systemic injection of the radioprotectant S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721) did not block hyperthermia induced by exposure to 10 Gy of gamma radiation, central administration did attenuate it. The dephosphorylated metabolite of WR-2721, N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,3-diaminopropane (WR-1065), accentuated radiation-induced hypothermia by both routes of administration. In brain homogenates, oxygen uptake was inhibited by WR-2721 but elevated by WR-1065. These results suggest that the antagonism of radiation-induced hypothermia found only after central administration of WR-2721 is due to its direct actions and not to its dephosphorylated metabolite and that this effect may be correlated with the inhibition by WR-2721 of oxygen uptake.",Included

1943,"Test of the paired-flash electroretinographic method in mice lacking b-waves. Previous studies of rod photoreceptors in vivo have employed a paired-flash electroretinographic (ERG) technique to determine rod response properties. To test whether absence versus presence of the ERG b-wave affects the photoreceptor response derived by the paired-flash method, we examined paired-flash-derived responses obtained from nob mice, a mutant strain with a defect in signal transduction between photoreceptors and ON bipolar cells that causes a lack of the b-wave. Normal littermates of the nob mice served as controls. The normalized amplitude-intensity relation of the derived response determined in nob mice at the near-peak time of 86 ms was similar to that determined for the controls. The full time course of the derived rod response was obtained for test flash strengths ranging from 0.11 to 17.38 scotopic cd s m(-2) (sc cd s m(-2)). Time-course data obtained from nob and control mice exhibited significant but generally modest differences. With saturating test flash strengths, half-recovery times for the derived response of nob versus control mice differed by approximately 60 ms or less about the combined (nob and control) average respective values. Time course data also were obtained before versus after intravitreal injection of L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB) (which blocks transmission from photoreceptors to depolarizing bipolar cells) and of cis 2,3-piperidine dicarboxylic acid (PDA) (which blocks transmission to OFF bipolar cells, and to horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells). Neither APB nor PDA substantially affected derived responses obtained from nob or control mice. The results provide quantitative information on the effect of b-wave removal on the paired-flash-derived response in mouse. They argue against a substantial skewing effect of the b-wave on the paired-flash-derived response obtained in normal mice and are consistent with the notion that, to good approximation, this derived response represents the isolated flash response of the photoreceptors in both nob and normal mice.",Excluded

Background: In nuclear medicine, some recent studies have continuously reported that 18F-Florbetaben (FBB) amyloid PET obtained early after intravenous injection (eFBB) reflects blood perfusion and neuronal function to detect Alzheimeras Disease (AD). If eFBB can be used for AD diagnosis, it can help to reduce radiation exposure and increase patient convinnience by discriminating between amyloid nagative AD and positive NC and replacing 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Method(s): We retrospectively collected 264 cases of eFBB, which included amyloid positive NC (25.42%) and negative AD (16.82%). In order to obtain SUVr for analysis, eFBB and dFBB images of each case were spatially registered though CT template and eFBB template, and count normalization was applied to cerebellum, brainstem, and whole brain regions, respectively to identify the best pre-processing step. We evaluated the explanatory power and classification performance of the data according to the intervention of eFBB through logistic regression analysis (LRA) and stratified 4-fold cross validation. For visual observation of the image, we observed the intensity distribution of the image through the t-contrast embedded in the SPM. Result(s): As a result of LRA, the highest explanatory power and classification performance (Nagelkerke R2=0.648, Accuracy=89.4%) were observed when using eFBB template and whole brain region as a reference region. Regardless, when both eFBB and dFBB were known to the model, the explanatory power and classification performance were improved. In evaluating the generalization performance of the selected model, it was also shown that classification performance improved when eFBB was involved in general. When count normalization was performed with Brainstem, It showed the highest performance (84.545%).

1945,"Planning evaluation of C-arm cone beam ct angiography for target delineation in stereotactic radiation surgery of brain arteriovenous malformations. Purpose: Stereotactic radiation surgery (SRS) is one of the therapeutic modalities currently available to treat cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Conventionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are used in combination to identify the target volume for SRS treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of C-arm cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the treatment planning of SRS for cerebral AVMs. Methods and Materials: Sixteen consecutive patients treated for brain AVMs at our institution were included in this retrospective study. Prior to treatment, all patients underwent MRA, DSA, and C-arm CBCT. All images were coregistered using the GammaPlan planning system. AVM regions were delineated independently by 2 physicians using either C-arm CBCT or MRA, resulting in 2 volumes: a CBCT volume (VCBCT) and an MRA volume (V<inf>MRA</inf>). SRS plans were generated based on the delineated regions. Results: The average volume of treatment targets delineated using C-arm CBCT and MRA were similar, 6.40 cm<sup>3</sup> and 6.98 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively (P=.82). However, significant regions of nonoverlap existed. On average, the overlap of the MRA with the C-arm CBCT was only 52.8% of the total volume. In most cases, radiation plans based on V<inf>MRA</inf> did not provide adequate dose to the region identified on C-arm CBCT; the mean minimum dose to V<inf>CBCT</inf> was 29.5%, whereas the intended goal was 45% (P<.001). The mean volume of normal brain receiving 12 Gy or more in C-arm CBCT-based plans was not greater than in the MRA-based plans. Conclusions: Use of C-arm CBCT images significantly alters the delineated regions of AVMs for SRS planning, compared to that of MRA/MRI images. CT-based planning can be accomplished without increasing the dose to normal brain and may represent a more accurate definition of the nidus, increasing the chances for successful obliteration.

Objectives: Damaged neural tracts contribute to the symptomatology of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (INPH). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to microstructural changes in white matter not always detectable with ordinary MRI. We evaluated relationships between DTI parameters and clinical profiles in INPH patients, along with differences in these DTI measures between CSF tap test (CSFTT) responders and non-responders. Method(s): Fifty-four INPH patients (26 CSFTT responders and 28 CSFTT non-responders) constituted the final group for analysis. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were assessed using atlas-based tract mapping methods for 12 different fiber tracts. Result(s): CSFTT non-responders, when compared to responders, showed lower FA values in the left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and left cingulum-hippocampus (CgH). The associations between clinical symptoms of INPH and DTI measures were most commonly found in the CgH. Higher MD in the CgH correlated with poorer cognitive performance. Higher MD in the right CgH also correlated with gait or motor dysfunction. Lower FA in the right CgH was correlated with urinary disturbance and cognitive impairment. Lower FA values in the corticospinal tract (CST) and right ATR significantly correlated with poorer cognitive performance, and correlated with gait dysfunction. Higher MD in left CST correlated with cognitive impairment. Conclusion(s): Our findings may suggest a possibility for considering microstructural changes in white matter in ventriculomegaly patients as potential imaging markers for the prediction of CSFTT responders.

1949,"Evaluation of a new foetal shielding device for pregnant brain tumour patients. Background: The present study aimed to propose a new foetal shielding device for pregnant cancer patients to reduce the foetal dose associated with treatment techniques using multiple gantry angles, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Method(s): Three shielding structures were designed to minimise the scattered and leaked radiation from various gantry angles and radiation scattering within the patient. The base-plate part that can be placed on the treatment couch was designed to reduce the scattered and leaked radiation generated at gantry angles located near 180degree. A body shielding part that can cover the lower chest and abdomen was designed, and a neck-shielding structure was added to reduce the internal and external radiation scattering from the treatment area. Evaluation plans were generated to assess the foetal dose reduction by the foetal shielding device in terms of the shielding material thickness, distance from the field edge, and shielding component using the flattened 6 MV photon beam (6MV) and flattening filter-free 6 MV photon beam (6MV-FFF). In addition, the effectiveness of the foetal shielding device was evaluated in a pregnant brain tumour patient. Result(s): The shielding material consisting of three parts was placed on frames composed of four arch shapes with a vertical curved structure, connection bar at the top position, and base plate. Each shielding part resulted in reductions in the radiation dose according to the treatment technique, as the thickness of the shielding material increased and the foetal dose decreased. In addition, a foetal dose reduction of approximately 50% was confirmed at 50 cm from the field edge by using the designed shielding device in most delivery techniques. In patients, the newly designed shielding structures can effectively eliminate up to about 49% of the foetal dose generated from various gantry angles used in VMAT or IMRT. Conclusion(s): We designed a foetal shielding device consisting of three parts to effectively reduce the dose delivered to the foetus, and evaluated the device with various treatment techniques for a pregnant patient with brain tumour. The foetal shielding device shielded the scattered/leaked radiation from the treatment machine, and also effectively reduced internal scattering from the treatment area in the patient.

1950,"Predictors of hearing preservation after stereotactic radiosurgery for acoustic neuroma. OBJECT: Many patients with acoustic neuromas (ANs) have hearing function at diagnosis and desire to maintain it. To date, radiosurgical techniques have been focused on conformal irradiation of the tumor mass, with less attention to inner ear structures for which there was scant radiobiological information. The authors of this study evaluated tumor control and hearing preservation as they relate to tumor volume, imaging characteristics, and nerve and cochlear radiation dose following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using the Gamma Knife.METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with ANs had serviceable hearing (Gardner-Robertson [GR] Class I or II) and underwent SRS between 2004 and 2007. This interval reflected more recent measurements of inner ear dosimetry during the authors' 21-year experience. The median patient age was 52 years (range 22-82 years). No patient had undergone any prior treatment for the ANs. The median tumor volume was 0.75 cm(3) (range 0.07-7.7 cm(3)), and the median radiation dose to the tumor margin was 12.5 Gy (range 12-13 Gy). At diagnosis, a greater distance from the lateral tumor to the end of the internal auditory canal correlated with better hearing function.RESULTS: At a median of 20 months after SRS, no patient required any other additional treatment. Serviceable hearing was preserved in 71% of all patients and in 89% (46 patients) of those with GR Class I hearing. Significant prognostic factors for maintaining the same GR class included (all pre-SRS) GR Class I hearing, a speech discrimination score (SDS) >or= 80%, a pure tone average (PTA) < 20 dB, and a patient age < 60 years. Significant prognostic factors for serviceable hearing preservation were (all pre-SRS) GR Class I hearing, an SDS >or= 80%, a PTA < 20 dB, a patient age < 60 years, an intracanalicular tumor location, and a tumor volume < 0.75 cm(3). Patients who received a radiation dose of < 4.2 Gy to the central cochlea had significantly better hearing preservation of the same GR class. Twelve of 12 patients < 60 years of age who had received a cochlear dose < 4.2 Gy retained serviceable hearing at 2 years post-SRS.CONCLUSIONS: As currently practiced, SRS with the Gamma Knife preserves serviceable hearing in the majority of patients. Tumor volume and anatomy relate to the hearing level before radiosurgery and influence technique. A low radiosurgical dose to the cochlea enhances hearing preservation.",Excluded

The median radiosurgery target volume at the time of the initial SRS was 0.5 cc and was 2.1 cc at the time of the second SRS. The median margin dose at the time of the initial SRS was 13 Gy and was 11 Gy at the time of the second SRS. The median interval between initial SRS and repeat SRS was 63 months (range, 25-169 months).RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 29 months after the second SRS (range, 13-71 months), tumor control or regression was achieved in all 6 patients. No patient developed symptomatic adverse radiation effects or new neurological symptoms after the second SRS.CONCLUSIONS: With this limited experience, we found that repeat SRS for a persistently enlarging acoustic neuroma can be performed safely and effectively.",Excluded

1953,"Effect of local extension sites on survival in locally advanced maxillary sinus cancer. Background: We analyzed the effects of local extension sites on survival in patients with locally advanced maxillary sinus cancer. Method(s): The criteria for inclusion in this study were as follows: (1) previously untreated maxillary sinus cancer; (2) squamous cell carcinoma; (3) T4 disease; and (4) curative-intent treatment. The data for 118 patients were obtained from 28 institutions across Japan and analyzed for overall survival and local control rates by local extension site. Result(s): Sites with a poor prognosis included the cribriform plate, dura, nasopharynx, middle cranial fossa, and cranial nerves other than V2. There was a significant correlation among these sites, except for the cranial nerves. Additionally, the hard palate was the only site that correlated with nodal involvement and showed a poor treatment outcome. Conclusion(s): Even in cases presenting with similar T4 maxillary sinus cancer, treatment should be performed in consideration of the local extension site. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1954,"Temporal evolution of perfusion parameters in brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery: comparison of intravoxel incoherent motion and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that is seeing increasing use in neuro-oncology and offers an alternative to contrast-enhanced perfusion techniques for evaluation of tumor blood volume after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). To date, IVIM has not been validated against contrast enhanced techniques for brain metastases after SRS. In the present study, we measure blood volume for 20 brain metastases (15 patients) at baseline, 1 week and 1 month after SRS using IVIM and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI. Correlation between blood volume measurements made with IVIM and DCE-MRI show poor correlation at baseline, 1 week, and 1 month post SRS (r = 0.33, 0.14 and 0.30 respectively). At 1 week after treatment, no significant change in tumor blood volume was found using IVIM or DCE-MRI (p = 0.81 and 0.41 respectively). At 1 month, DCE-MRI showed a significant decrease in blood volume (p = 0.0002). IVIM, on the other hand, demonstrated the opposite effect and showed a significant increase in blood volume at 1 month (p = 0.03). The results of this study indicate that blood volume measured with IVIM and DCE-MRI are not equivalent. While this may relate to differences in the type of perfusion information each technique is providing, it could also reflect a limitation of tumor blood volume measurements made with IVIM after SRS. IVIM measurements of tumor blood volume in the month after SRS should therefore be interpreted with caution.",Excluded

The depth distribution of the thermal neutron flux is a major factor in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) in determining the efficiency of cell sterilization. In this paper the fission detector method is developed and applied to measure the in-phantom thermal neutron flux depth distribution. Advantages of the fission detector include small size, direct measurement of thermal neutron flux in a mixed radiation field of BNCT beam, self- calibration, and the possibility of on-line measurement. The measurements were performed at epithermal a BNCT facility. The experimental results were compared with the thermal neutron flux calculated by the Monte Carlo method and found to be in good agreement.",Excluded

1959,"Effectiveness of lead cap in radiation protection of head in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. Aims: Occupational head exposure of radiation was suggested to be associated with brain tumors in interventional cardiologists. The brain is of particular interest, because it is one of the least protected organs during interventional procedures. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the lead cap in radiation protection of the head and compare it with that of a ceiling mounted lead glass screen in a real life setting. Our secondary goal was to test the comfort and convenience of the lead cap when worn on a regular daily basis. Methods and Results: Radiation dose to the operator was recorded by the three dosimeters placed outside the lead cap, inside the cap and outside the apron at the level of trunk for a total of 18 months. Only the lead cap (Burkhart Roentgen International, St Petersburg, Florida, USA) but not the ceiling suspended protective glass screen was used during the first three months of measurement of radiation dose to the head. Later concomitant use of both protection devices was analysed. The dosimeter outside the cap recorded a dose of 2.77 mSv radiation when the ceiling mounted screen was not used during the first 3 months. The doses were 2.4 to 12.5 times higher in comparison to the measurements that were recorded when the ceiling suspended screen was used. However, a remarkable dose of radiation (ranged between 1.16-0.22 mSv) was received by the operators head despite the use of ceiling mounted screen. Yet, even without the protection of the ceiling mounted screen, the dose recorded by the dosimeter inside the lead cap during the first period was <0.1 mSv. As expected, the doses to the head recorded by the dosimeter inside the cap during the next 15 months period were also less than 0.1 mSv with the use of the ceiling mounted screen. Therefore, a cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless of the use of the screen. Conclusion(s): A cap with only 0.5 mm lead equivalence was much more protective than the mounted screen and reduced the dose to the head to ignorable levels regardless the use of the mounted screen. Although being a subjective conclusion, the operator regularly wearing the lead cap reported that the lead cap is reasonably comfortable and offers an acceptable wearing comfort when used on daily practice.",Excluded

A series of monomeric porphyrins (2-8) based on porphyrin C (1) have been tested as sensitisers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cerebral glioma using the in vitro/in vivo C6 intracerebral animal tumour model. The in vivo screening, consisting of cytotoxicity, phototoxicity (red light) and subcellular localisation studies, revealed two sensitisers (porphyrin 7, molecular weight 863 Da and porphyrin 8, molecular weight 889 Da), which had greater photoactivity than porphyrin C and similar photoactivity to haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) although at a 5-fold higher dose than HpD. Both sensitisers showed intracellular localisation to discrete organelle sites and exhibited considerably less 'dark' cytotoxicity than HpD. The kinetics of uptake of porphyrins 7 and 8 was studied in the mouse C6 glioma model as well as in biopsy samples from normal brain, liver, spleen and blood. Maximal drug uptake levels in tumour occurred 9 and 6 h after intraperitoneal injection for 7 and 8 respectively, at which time the tumour to normal brain ratios were 15:1 and 13:1 respectively. The effect of PDT using porphyrin 7 activated by the gold metal vapour laser tuned to 627.8 nm was studied in Wistar rats bearing intracerebral C6 glioma.

Objective: To determine the characteristics and prognosis of brain metastasised HER-2 positive breast cancer (BC) patients. Study Design: Descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Turkey between 2000 and 2019. Methodology: HER-2 positive BC patients were analysed retrospectively and 105 patients were included in the study. Age 18 years and over, HER-2 positive BC, with BM (brain metastases) were the inclusion criteria. Patients with secondary malignancies, those with missing data, and irregular follow-up were excluded from the study. The age, type of treatment, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score, BM date, and the last contact date of the patients were obtained from the hospital records. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the time to BM and OS. Independent factors affecting OS and time to BM were determined using the Cox regression model. Result(s): Patients with ECOG PS score of 0-1 at the time of the BM had 19 months median overall survival (OS), while patients with ECOG PS score of 2 had 8 months (p <0.01). Median OS after BM was 32 and 14 months for patients with one BM and patients with multiple BM, respectively (p <0.01). Multivariate cox regression analyses revealed that time to progression of BM was shorter in patients with high-grade tumors compared to patients with low-grade tumors (p= 0.048), and in patients with de-novo metastasis compared to patients without de-novo metastasis (p= 0.003). Conclusion: Tumor grade and de-novo metastasis (extracranial metastasis at the time of diagnosis) are independent predictive factors that may cause the earlier occurrence of BM and affect mortality in BC patients.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Papillary endothelial hyperplasia (PEH) is a rare form of exuberant reactive endothelial proliferation that can mimic neoplasm. We report the largest series of patients with histologically confirmed intracranial extravascular PEH developing in the field of previous treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery.CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We collected the clinical, radiological, surgical, and pathological findings from 4 patients in whom intracranial extravascular PEH developed after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery. In all patients, the development of an enlarging hemorrhagic mass lesion at the site of previous radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging was radiographically suspicious for neoplasm and prompted biopsy or resection. All 4 patients elected to undergo biopsy or surgical resection. Histological examination of the biopsy and resection specimens in all patients demonstrated the classic features of PEH.CONCLUSION: The interval to the development of PEH ranged from 5 months to 6 years, 10 months. Clinical follow-up was available for 3 of the 4 patients. None of these 3 patients have demonstrated evidence of recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 22 months (range, 15-30 months). These patients share common radiological features, potentially allowing preoperative diagnosis and improved guidance of clinical management. These cases suggest a link between radiosurgery and the development of PEH. These findings also suggest that PEH should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients treated with radiosurgery in whom a hemorrhagic mass lesion subsequently develops at or near the site of previous treatment. We think that complete surgical excision is the best treatment for intracranial PEH.",Excluded

The relationship among radiotherapy,surgery and systemic therapy has to be considered in those situations.In breast conserving therapy, the usefulness of breast irradiation is well established. Otherwise, a local controllability depend on a grade of residual tumor cell has not been understand. The authors conducted the survey of 941 cases of positive surgical margins and found that doses more than 60 Gy has a tendency for better local control in post menopausal cases. To reduce patient's burden,3 weeks short course irradiation (Canadian protocol) or accelerated partial breast irradiation have been introduced in breast irradiation. A subgroup which has no need to irradiate to conserving breast had not been identified. The timing between postoperative chemotherapy and irradiation is another point that has to be considered. To reduce distant metastasis,chemotherapy first has been considered better. As for post mastectomy regional irradiation, improvement of local and systemic control has been widely known these days. A timing of systemic therapy and irradiation is a point has to consider. In inoperable or far advanced T 4 tumors, breast irradiation with concurrent chemotherapy must be considered in stead of surgery.

The dependence of the dose-response curves on the follow-up time and the definition of the biological end point were determined. Tolerance doses were calculated at several effect probability levels and times after irradiation. The MRI changes were found to be dependent on dose and progressive in time.

Objectives To determine dosimetry of a novel vesicular acetylcholine transporter [<sup>18</sup>F]VAT based on PET scans in nonhuman primates with potential for investigation of neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Methods We collected transmission scans to cover four body sections: A (eyes and whole brain), B (heart and lungs), C (liver, gallbladder and kidneys), and D (urinary bladder, small and large intestines) in two male and a female macaque fascicularis. This was followed by 4 hour long sequential whole-body scan immediately after injection of 5.01-5.36 mCi [<sup>18</sup>F]VAT tracer. Arterial blood samples were obtained in the female animal over a total scanning time. Time activity curves (TAC) were created from regions of Interest (ROIs) that encompassed entire small organs or samples with highest activity within large organs. Organ residence times were calculated based on TAC. We then entered the organ residence times in OLINDA/EXM to calculate human radiation dose estimates. Results The blood time activity resulted in a residence time 0.30 hr in agreement with the residence time calculated based on the time activity curve measured in the left ventricle by PET 0.39 hr.

Due to the widespread usage of MW radiation, especially in our homes, it is essential to investigate the direct effect of MW radiation on the central nervous system. Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the effect of MW radiation on memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

The incidence for hemorrhage in non-obliterated arteriovenous malformations (AVM) during the first two years following Gamma Knife (GK) surgery was compared to the calculated incidence in untreated patients. There was a decrease in the incidence of hemorrhage as compared to the natural course. This difference was statistically significant. The actual number of hemorrhages during the first two years was 49 in a series of 1604 patients. Additionally, 41 hemorrhages occurred beyond the two years following treatment over the entire follow up time span of up to 24 years. For the first two years the calculated incidence was roughly two times higher than the observed incidence. This impact on the natural history was detectable already within six months after the treatment for the malformations totally covered with at least 25 Gy. The relation between a high minimum and a high average dose on the one hand and a lower risk for hemorrhage on the other hand was statistically significant. Low treatment doses and high age correlated to a higher risk. Neither hemorrhage prior to treatment nor time interval between presenting hemorrhage and treatment seemed to influence the risk for post treatment hemorrhage. The risk for permanent neurological deficit or death due to AVM rupture during the latency period between the time of treatment and total nidus obliteration was less than 0.5% for small AVM and 2-4% for large ones during the first two years.

The factors of a various energetic nature the extreme levels of which both directly (via special receptors) and mediately influence and change the functions of nervous system are studied. Empirical data suggest conclusively that the general biological regularities of the effects of an ""intensity-time"" type is also valid on the organism level if the central nervous system is thought of as an irritable object. In all cases the initial cause of the disturbed cerebral activity is an external energetic irritative action. It is demonstrated that the character of human response to the extreme effects of some flight factors corresponds to general biological regularity of the reaction toward irritating stimulus. In this case the general mechanism of such reactions of the nervous system is an exhaustion of the energetic brain resources. There have been derived the equalities which define the quantitative relationships among the equivalent levels of extreme flight factor effects and the common unit of their measurement is introduced. On the basis of general biological regularities of the body response to irritating stimulus, the method for estimating and predicting useful consciousness time of the pilot in case of a combined effect of the flight factors under extreme conditions is suggested.

The amplitude of potassium increases in the vitreous humor was reduced to approximately 10 percent by 50 micromolar barium, while potassium increases in the inner plexiform layer were largely unchanged. The decrease in the vitreal potassium response was accurately simulated with a numerical model of potassium current flow through Muller cells, the principal glial cells of the retina. Barium also substantially increased the input resistance of Muller cells and blocked the Muller cell-generated M-wave, indicating that barium blocks the potassium channels of Muller cells. Thus, after a light-evoked potassium increase within the retina, there is a substantial transfer of potassium from the retina to the vitreous humor by potassium current flow through Muller cells.",Excluded

1982,"Angiographic, hemodynamic, and histological changes in an animal model of brain arteriovenous malformations treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Object Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a major cause of stroke. Many AVMs are effectively obliterated by stereotactic radiosurgery, but such treatment for lesions larger than 3 cm is not as effective. Understanding the responses to radiosurgery may lead to new biological enhancements to this treatment modality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hemodynamic, morphological, and histological effects of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in an animal model of brain AVM. Methods An arteriovenous fistula was created by anastomosing the left external jugular vein to the side of the common carotid artery in 64 male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 345 +/- 8.8 g). Six weeks after AVM creation, 32 rats were treated with a single dose of GKS (20 Gy); 32 animals received sham radiation. Eight irradiated and 8 control animals were studied at each specified time point (1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks) for hemodynamic, morphological, and histological characterization. Results Two AVMs showed partial angiographic obliteration at 6 weeks. Angiography revealed complete obliteration in 3 irradiated rats at 12 weeks. Blood flow in the ipsilateral proximal carotid artery (p < 0.001) and arterialized jugular vein (p < 0.05) was significantly lower in the irradiated group than in the control group. The arterialized vein's external diameter was significantly smaller in GKS-treated animals at 6 (p < 0.05) and 12 (p < 0.001) weeks. Histological changes included subendothelial cellular proliferation and luminal narrowing in GKS-treated animals. Neither luminal obliteration nor thrombus formation was identified at any of the time points in either irradiated or nonirradiated animals. Conclusions GKS produced morphological, angiographic, and histological changes in the model of AVM as early as 6 weeks after treatment. These results support the use of this model for studying methods to enhance radiation response in AVMs. Copyright © AANS, 2015.",Excluded
1983,"[Brain lesions after radiotherapy]. On the basis of literature reports up to 1988 the incidence, clinical pattern and treatment of cerebral complications following radiotherapy administered to the organs and tissues of the head are discussed. Acute radiation-induced reaction and early delayed reaction in the form of e.g. the so called somnolence syndrome or rhombencephalopathy are rare and their prognosis is usually good. In 1 to 14% of the patients delayed reaction may develop corresponding to the late radiation necrosis, usually with progressive unfavourable course. A problem of practical importance is the impossibility of differentiating radiation-induced cerebral necrosis from recurrence, expansion of the primary tumour or metastatic tumour, even using CT and MNR. Only the poorly available positron emission tomography makes possible differential diagnosis. Sometimes, surgical or pharmacological treatment of cerebral necrosis is effective.

Background: Brain metastases in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) occur rarely and are associated with a poor prognosis. No significant risk factors have been identified and no evidence-based treatment guidelines are currently available. Case Report: A 56-year-old EOC patient presented with seizure at the Emergency Department eleven days after completion of fourth-line chemotherapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PhD). A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple metastases. The patient received radiotherapy with a total dose of 30.8 Gy and 8 cycles of paclitaxel resulting in stable disease. Based on the current literature, treatment options are discussed.

1986,"Combining pedicle screw stimulation with spinal navigation, a protocol to maximize the safety of neural elements and minimize radiation exposure in thoracolumbar spine instrumentation. Purpose: The O-arm-based navigation increases the accuracy of pedicle screw positioning and offers the possibility of performing a 3D scan before wound closure. However, repeating the 3D scan exposes the patient to additional radiation. We combined O-arm navigation with pedicle screw (PS) stimulation followed by a 3D scan to evaluate their accuracy and aimed for the creation of a protocol that maximizes the safety and minimizes radiation. Method(s): Patients had pedicle screws insertion using O-arm spinal navigation, then had PS triggered electromyography (EMG), and finally a 3D scan to evaluate the accuracy of screw position. Result(s): 447 screws were inserted in 71 patients. In 10 patients, 11 screws needed repositioning. Comparing results of PS triggered EMG responses to the 3D scan, we found: (a) negative stimulation response with negative 3D scan findings, corresponding to 432 acceptable screw position (96.6 %) in 58 patients (81.7 %). In these cases, the redo 3D scan could be avoided. (b) Positive stimulation response with positive 3D scan findings, corresponding to 7 unacceptable screw position (1.5 %) in 6 patients (8.4 %). In these cases, PS stimulation detected malpositioned screws that would be missed without a redo 3D scan. Conclusion(s): We propose a protocol of routinely performing PS stimulation after screw insertion using spinal navigation. In case of positive stimulation, a 3D scan must be performed to rule out a probable screw mal position (6 patients 8.4 %). However, in case of negative stimulation, redo 3D scan can be avoided in 81.7 % of patients. Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1987,"Interaction between the short-wavelength cone and rod systems in the electroretinogram of the cynomolgus monkey. We recorded electroretinograms from anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys by means of three monochromatic (435, 524 or 579 nm) full-field stimuli presented with a monochromatic background light. The color of the background light was changed with 29 interference filters (400-700 nm). Waveforms were analyzed by means of principal component analysis to investigate interaction between the short-wavelength cone and other systems. With the same test lights, responses were also recorded during dark adaptation after 20,000-lux full bleach. The shape of the short-wavelength cone electroretinogram changed as a function of the wavelength of monochromatic background light. The change was clearer around 500-nm background light, to which the rod system is highly sensitive. Further, short-wavelength cone responses developed during the first 15 min in the dark; however, they became smaller with the recovery of the rod system. These findings suggest that there is interaction between the short-wavelength cone and rod systems. In addition, the results of waveform analysis confirmed the interaction between the long-wavelength and middle-wavelength cone systems.",Excluded
1988,"Study of antioxidative effects and anti-inflammatory effects in mice due to low-dose X-irradiation or radon inhalation. Low-dose irradiation induces various stimulating effects, especially activation of the biological defense system including antioxidative and immune functions. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause cell damage and death and can induce many types of diseases. This paper reviews new insights into inhibition of ROS-related diseases with low-dose irradiation or radon inhalation. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before or after carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment inhibits hepatopathy in mice. X-irradiation (0.5 Gy) before ischemia-reperfusion injury or cold-induced brain injury also inhibits edema. These findings suggest that low-dose X-irradiation has antioxidative effects due to blocking the damage induced by free radicals or ROS. Moreover, radon inhalation increases superoxide dismutase activity in many organs and inhibits CCl4-induced hepatic and renal damage and streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes. These findings suggest that radon inhalation also has antioxidative effects. This antioxidative effect against CCl4-induced hepatopathy is comparable to treatment with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) at a dose of 500 mg/kg weight, or alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) treatment at a dose of 300 mg/kg weight, and is due to activation of antioxidative functions. In addition, radon inhalation inhibits carrageenan-induced inflammatory paw edema, suggesting that radon inhalation has anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, radon inhalation inhibits formalin-induced inflammatory pain and chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, suggesting that radon inhalation relieves pain. Thus, low-dose irradiation very likely activates the defense systems in the body, and therefore, contributes to preventing or reducing ROS-related injuries, which are thought to involve peroxidation.",Included

OBJECTIVE: Radiation-induced mucositis (RIM) in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for head and neck cancer (HNC) causes severe pain and worsens CRT compliance, QOL and outcome. Following retrospective reports, we conducted a randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of gabapentin for RIM-associated pain during CRT.METHODS: HNC patients (pts) receiving CRT were randomized to standard pain control (SPC) with acetaminophen and opioids, or SPC plus gabapentin (SPC+G). Gabapentin was maintained at 900mg/day for 4 weeks after CRT. Primary endpoint was maximum visual analogue scale (VAS) score during CRT, and secondary endpoints were total opioid dose, changes in QOL (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HN 35) from baseline to 4 weeks after CRT, and adverse events.RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible Stage III or IV pts were randomly assigned to SPC or SPC+G (n=11 each). Twelve were treated in a locally advanced setting and 10 in a postoperative setting. Median maximum VAS scores, median total dose of opioids at maximum VAS and total dose of opioids at 4 weeks after CRT tended to be higher in the SPC+G arm (47 in SPC vs. 74 in SPC+G, p=0.517; 215mg vs. 745.3mg, p=0.880; and 1260mg vs. 1537.5mg, p=0.9438, respectively), without significance. QOL analysis showed significantly worse scores in the SPC+G arm for weight gain (p=0.005). Adverse events related to gabapentin were manageable.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study is the first prospective randomized trial of gabapentin for RIM-related pain. Gabapentin had no apparent beneficial effect. Further research into agents for RIM-related pain is warranted.",Excluded

The antimutagenic effects of the radiation protective agent, S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721), were studied against fission-spectrum-neutron- and 60Co-gamma-ray-induced mutagenesis in mice. Mutagenesis at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus was measured 56 days following whole-body irradiation with JANUS neutrons (single doses, 50-150 cGy) or 60Co photons (single doses, 250-750 cGy). Splenic T lymphocytes from B6CF1 mice were grown in round-bottomed 96-microwell culture plates with or without the selective agent 6-thioguanine (6-TG). The mutant frequency, as a result of exposure to neutrons or 60Co photons, increased 100-fold with dose. Doses of 150 cGy neutrons and 750 cGy 60Co photons were equally mutagenic. When animals were injected with WR-2721 at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight, i.p., 30 min before whole-body irradiation with JANUS neutrons or 60Co photons, mutant frequencies were significantly reduced at all radiation doses (i.e. protection factors of 1.4 and 2.4, respectively).

AIM: To determine interfractional three-dimensional set-up errors using X-ray volumetric imaging (XVI).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2007 and August 2009, 125 patients were taken up for image-guided radiotherapy using online XVI. After matching of reference and acquired volume view images, set-up errors in three translation directions were recorded and corrected online before treatment each day. Mean displacements, population systematic (SIGMA), and random (sigma) errors were calculated and analyzed using SPSS (v16) software. Optimum clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin was calculated using Van Herk's (2.5SIGMA + 0.7 sigma) and Stroom's (2SIGMA + 0.7 sigma) formula.RESULTS: Patients were grouped in 4 cohorts, namely brain, head and neck, thorax, and abdomen-pelvis. The mean vector displacement recorded were 0.18 cm, 0.15 cm, 0.36 cm, and 0.35 cm for brain, head and neck, thorax, and abdomen-pelvis, respectively. Analysis of individual mean set-up errors revealed good agreement with the proposed 0.3 cm isotropic margins for brain and 0.5 cm isotropic margins for head-neck. Similarly, 0.5 cm circumferential and 1 cm craniocaudal proposed margins were in agreement with thorax and abdomen-pelvic cases.CONCLUSION: The calculated mean displacements were well within CTV-PTV margin estimates of Van Herk (90% population coverage to minimum 95% prescribed dose) and Stroom (99% target volume coverage by 95% prescribed dose). Employing these individualized margins in a particular cohort ensure comparable target coverage as described in literature, which is further improved if XVI-aided set-up error detection and correction is used before treatment.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Tumor response rate to gefitinib by previously treated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer was approximately 20%. However, there are few reports about effect of re-treatment with gefitinib. CASE: A 40-year-old man was given a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of lung (c-T2N3M1). Response was not obtained with chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin, vinorelbine + gencitabin). He developed brain metastasis and received whole brain radiation therapy. He was then given gefitinib. Reduction of the primary tumor, brain metastasis, pulmonary metastasis and liver metastasis was seen. Recurrence of pulmonary metastasis and liver metastasis was discovered 8 months after treatment with gefitinib. Therefore, treatment by gefitinib was stopped. Response was not achieved with chemotherapy (docetaxel and amrubicin). At the request of the patient, retreatment with gefitinib was resumed. Disappearance of brain metastasis was achieved. However, primary tumor, pulmonary metastasis and liver metastasis progressed. CONCLUSION(S): We reported a case whose brain metastases disappeared with re-treatment with gefitinib.

1995,"Fail-Safe Therapy by Gamma-Ray Irradiation Against Tumor Formation by Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Progenitors. Cell replacement therapy holds great promise for Parkinson's disease (PD), but residual undifferentiated cells and immature neural progenitors in the therapy may cause tumor formation. Although cell sorting could effectively exclude these proliferative cells, from the viewpoint of clinical application, there exists no adequate coping strategy in the case of their contamination. In this study, we analyzed a component of proliferative cells in the grafts of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors and investigated the effect of radiation therapy on tumor formation. In our differentiating protocol, analyses of neural progenitors (day 19) revealed that the proliferating cells expressed early neural markers (SOX1, PAX6) or a dopaminergic neuron progenitor marker (FOXA2). When grafted into the rat striatum, these immature neurons gradually became postmitotic in the brain, and the rosette structures disappeared at 14 weeks. However, at 4-8 weeks, the SOX1(+)PAX6(+) cells formed rosette structures in the grafts, suggesting their tumorigenic potential. Therefore, to develop a fail-safe therapy against tumor formation, we investigated the effect of radiation therapy. At 4 weeks posttransplantation, when KI67(+) cells comprised the highest ratio, radiation therapy with (137)Cs Gammacell Exactor for tumor-bearing immunodeficient rats showed a significant decrease in graft volume and percentage of SOX1(+)KI67(+) cells in the graft, thus demonstrating the preventive effect of gamma-ray irradiation against tumorigenicity.

A long-standing concept in vision science has held that a single photoreceptor expresses a single type of opsin, the protein component of visual pigment. However, the number of examples in the literature of photoreceptors from vertebrates and invertebrates that break this rule is increasing. Here, we describe a newly discovered Limulus opsin, Limulus opsin5, which is significantly different from previously characterized Limulus opsins, opsins1 and 2. We show that opsin5 is co-expressed with opsins1 and 2 in Limulus lateral and ventral eye photoreceptors and provide the first evidence that the expression of co-expressed opsins can be differentially regulated. We show that the relative levels of opsin5 and opsin1 and 2 in the rhabdom change with a diurnal rhythm and that their relative levels are also influenced by the animal's central circadian clock. An analysis of the sequence of opsin5 suggests it is sensitive to visible light (400-700 nm) but that its spectral properties may be different from that of opsins1 and 2. Changes in the relative levels of these opsins may underlie some of the dramatic day-night changes in Limulus photoreceptor function and may produce a diurnal change in their spectral sensitivity.",Excluded

AIM: Urogenital dysfunction is a common sequela following total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. This prospective study analyzed potential risk factors and investigated the impact of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring.METHOD: Included were 85 patients undergoing total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, 43 under the control of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring. Urogenital function was assessed with validated questionnaires within a 2-year follow-up period. Potential risk factors were identified by multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Overall, approximately one-third of treated patients suffered from new onset of urinary dysfunction. Initially, half of the sexually active patients were affected by sexual dysfunction; after 2 years, almost three quarters were affected. In the pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring group, urinary and sexual dysfunction rates including minor and major disturbances were significantly lower (2-year follow-up 20% vs. 51% (p = 0.004) and 56% vs. 90% (p = 0.010)). Throughout the survey, non-performance of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring was found to be an independent risk factor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was identified as an independent predictor for urogenital dysfunction in the further course one and 2 years after surgery.CONCLUSION: Pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with significantly lower rates of urinary and sexual dysfunction in the short and long run, whereas neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has a negative impact only in the long run.",Excluded

Over the last two decades enormous advances in this area have been made allowing noninvasive evaluation of the orbit and brain. The idea of using nuclear magnetic resonance technology to produce images rather than the ionizing radiation of computed tomography (CT) began to emerge clinically in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Although the quality of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was not much better than CT images, by the early 1990s, it became obvious that MRI had particular strength in identifying lesions in the posterior fossa, and demyelinating plaques. With advances in magnetic strength, computer software, surface coils, contrast medium, and more attention to the basic physics of magnet technology, the clarity of MR images improved dramatically.

Ten patients with head and neck cancer and 10 patients with prostate cancer were studied using their treatment plans from Pinnacle<sup>3</sup> 9.2 (Philips Medical, Fitchburg, WI).

The maximum BED values that were calculated using the BED<inf>A</inf> and BED<inf>T</inf> methods were also analyzed. BED<inf>A</inf> was found to always underestimate BED<inf>T</inf>. The accuracy and precision of BED<inf>A</inf> distributions varied between the organs: for optic chiasm and brainstem, 50% of the patients had an overall BED<inf>A</inf> percent error of <1%; for left and right optic nerves, rectum, and bladder, 60% to 70% of the patients had an overall BED<inf>A</inf> percent error of <1%; and for normal brain and spinal cord, 80% of the patients had an overall BED<inf>A</inf> percent error of <1%.

2004,"Extracranial radiosurgery (stereotactic body radiation therapy) for oligometastases. Extracranial radiosurgery, also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), is an increasingly used method of treatment of limited cancer metastases located in a variety of organs/sites including the spine, lungs, liver, and other areas in the abdomen and pelvis. The techniques used to perform SBRT were initially modeled after intracranial radiosurgery, although considerable evolution in technique and conduct has occurred for extracranial applications. Unlike intracranial radiosurgery, SBRT requires characterization and accounting for inherent organ movement including breathing motion. Potent dose hypofractionation schedules have been used with SBRT such that the treatment is generally both ablative and convenient. Because the treatment is severely damaging to tissues within and about the target, the volume of adjacent normal tissue must be strictly minimized to avoid toxic late effects. Outcomes in various sites show very high rates of local control with toxicity mostly related to tubular tissues like the airways and bowels. With proper conduct though, SBRT can be an extremely effective treatment option for oligometastases. [References: 67]",Excluded

Comparing different coverage densities of the spacer on the nanoparticle surface, we assess the best conditions for an effective drug transport and release: only at full coverage, DOX does not slip among the dopamine molecules to reach the nanoparticle surface, which is crucial to avoid the formation of stable coordinative bonds with under-coordinated Ti atoms. Finally, given the strong absorption properties and fluorescence of DOX and of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst, we model the effect of light irradiation through excited state calculations to localize excitons and to follow the charge carrier's life path. This fundamental study on the nature and mechanism of drug/carrier interaction provides a solid ground for the rational design of new experimental protocols for a more efficient drug transport and release and its combination with photodynamic therapy.",Excluded
2007,"Effects of microgravity on cerebral hemodynamics. After centuries of wonder, human being finally realized the decisive possibility of going to the moon a little more than 50 years ago, and in 1969 this became a reality, no longer a dream. The human body, however, is designed to live under 1 g as on Earth. Thus, it is important to understand what happens in the human body under microgravity in order to make rapid progress in space development. One of the most serious problems produced by microgravity is a fluid shift from lower to upper body. This cephalad fluid shift may change the hemodynamics in the brain. In this review, effects of actual or simulated microgravity on cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, formation of brain edema, and orthostatic intolerance will be discussed. These studies provide us lots of information not only to maintain the health of astronauts but also to treat senile persons who, on rare occasions, sit or stand up.",Excluded

In this study, we investigated the adhesion and neurite outgrowth of nerve cells on a fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation. We used fluorinated polyimide because of its biocompatibility and excellent thermal and mechanical properties for ion irradiation. Rattus norvegicus chromaffin (PC12) cells were used for in vitro studies. The polyimide films were irradiated with He(+), Ne(+), or Kr(+) ions in a fluence range from 10(13) to 10(15) ions/cm(2) at 50 keV. PC12 cells selectively adhered to the polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation. The total neurite length for PC12 cells grown on the Kr(+)-irradiated film was the longest; the neurite length on the film irradiated by Kr(+) after 9 days was approximately five times longer than that for cells grown on the He(+)-irradiated film, i.e., 135 micro m. In addition, the PC12 differentiation rate on the ion-irradiated polyimide films also showed a similar trend to the total neurite length for PC12 cells cultured on the films: the rate decreased in the order Kr(+) > Ne(+) > He(+). This initial study indicated enhanced neurite outgrowth and differentiation of PC12 cells on fluorinated polyimide film micropatterned by ion irradiation.",Excluded

Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been proposed as an alternative to surgical resection. We report serious adverse effects of the treatment after follow-up periods over 9 years in 11 patients treated with GKRS between 1997 and 2000. The target volume of the entorhinoamygdalohippocampectomy area was 4.8-17.1 ml. Marginal dose of 20-25 Gy to the 50% isodose was delivered. One patient was drowned after suffering seizure 7 months after GKRS. Two patients did not show any reduction in seizure frequency over 9 and 18 months. Both patients requested open surgery and became seizure-free postoperatively. Four of the other eight patients were classified as Engel's class I within 4 years after GKRS. One of the four patients experienced symptomatic radiation-induced cerebral edema transiently, one developed radiation necrosis and required surgery 5 years after GKRS, and one developed cognitive impairment with hemiparesis 10 years after GKRS. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed a large cyst in the irradiated temporal lobe. This patient recovered fully after the cyst excision. Only one patient became seizure-free and antiepileptic drug-free without symptomatic radiation-induced complications. However, MR imaging revealed abnormal enhancement, cyst formation, and diffuse white matter change in the irradiated temporal lobe 9 years after GKRS. GKRS for MTLE causes adverse effects of delayed seizure remission and symptomatic radiation-induced complications. Therefore, GKRS cannot be considered as an ideal alternative to surgery for MTLE. Long-term follow-up studies including MR imaging with contrast medium are required for the patients even after successful control of seizures.",Excluded

2013,"A new reference point for patient dose estimation in neurovascular interventional radiology. In interventional radiology, dose estimation using the interventional reference point (IRP) is a practical method for obtaining the real-time skin dose of a patient. However, the IRP is defined in terms of adult cardiovascular radiology and is not suitable for dosimetry of the head. In the present study, we defined a new reference point (neuro-IRP) for neuro-interventional procedures. The neuro-IRP was located on the central ray of the X-ray beam, 9 cm from the isocenter, toward the focal spot. To verify whether the neuro-IRP was accurate in dose estimation, we compared calculated doses at the neuro-IRP and actual measured doses at the surface of the head phantom for various directions of the X-ray projection. The resulting calculated doses were fairly consistent with actual measured doses, with the error in this estimation within approximately 15%.

PURPOSE: To clarify the incidence, symptoms, and timing of extrapulmonary fibrosis developing after hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 379 consecutive patients who underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy for lung tumors at four institutions between February 2001 and March 2007. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 1-72). We investigated the subjective and objective characteristics of the extrapulmonary masses, redelineated the origin tissue of each on the treatment planning computed tomography scan, and generated dose-volume histograms.RESULTS: In 9 patients (2.4%), extrapulmonary masses were found 3-36 months (median, 14) after irradiation. Coexisting swelling occurred in 3 patients, chest pain in 2, thumb numbness in 1, and arm edema in 1 patient. Extrapulmonary masses occurred in 5 (5.4%) of 92 and 4 (1.4%) of 287 patients irradiated with a 62.5-Gy and 48.0-Gy isocenter dose, respectively. The mean and maximal dose to the origin tissue was 25.8-53.9 Gy (median, 43.7) and 47.5-62.5 Gy (median, 50.2), respectively. In 5 of 9 patients, the standardized uptake values on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography was 1.8-2.8 (median, 2.2). Percutaneous needle biopsy was performed in 3 patients, and all the specimens showed benign fibrotic changes without malignant cells.CONCLUSION: All patients should be carefully followed after stereotactic body radiotherapy. The findings of any new lesion should prompt an assessment for radiation-induced extrapulmonary fibrosis before an immediate diagnosis of recurrence is made. Careful beam-shape modification and dose prescription near the thoracic outlet are required to prevent forearm neuropathy and lymphedema.",Excluded
2015,"Simultaneous measurement of changes in light absorption due to the reduction of cytochrome c oxidase and light scattering in rat brains during loss of tissue viability. We performed the simultaneous measurement of intrinsic optical signals (IOSs) related to metabolic activity and cellular and subcellular morphological characteristics, i.e., light scattering for a rat global ischemic brain model made by rapidly removing blood by saline infusion. The signals were measured on the basis of multiwavelength diffuse reflectances in which 605 and 830 nm were used to detect the IOSs that are thought to be dominantly affected by redox changes of heme aa(3) and CuA in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), respectively. For measuring the scattering signal, the wavelength that was found to be most insensitive to the absorption changes, e.g., approximately 620 nm, was used. The measurements suggested that an increase in the absorption due to reduction of heme aa(3) occurred soon after blood clearance, and this was followed by a large triphasic change in light scattering, during which time a decrease in the absorption due to reduction of CuA occurred. Through the triphasic scattering change, scattering signals increased by 5.2 +/- 1.5% (n = 5), and the increase in light scattering showed significant correlation with both the reflectance intensity changes at 605 and 830 nm. This suggests that morphological changes in cells correlate with reductions of heme aa(3) and CuA. Histological analysis of tissue after the triphasic scattering change showed no alteration in either the nuclei or the cytoskeleton, but electron microscopic observation revealed deformed, enlarged mitochondria and expanded dendrites. These findings suggest that the simultaneous measurement of absorption signals related to the redox changes in the CcO and the scattering signal is useful for monitoring tissue viability in the brain.",Excluded

The flash-induced reflectance increases (bleaching) were calculated by dividing the reflectance of the first image into the subsequent images, pixel by pixel.RESULTS: The topography of the bleached macula corresponded well with the anatomical distribution of the cones. The ratio of reflectance changes in the center to that in the surrounding tissue was high for red and low for green and blue images. These results indicate that the reflectivity changes were not artifacts but were derived from changes in the photopigment density in the cones and rods.CONCLUSIONS: The topography of bleached photoreceptors obtained with a commercial fundus camera from one monkey and three healthy human subjects showed that this technique has potential as a new clinical method for examining photoreceptor function in both normal and diseased retinas.",Excluded

When microtubules assembled in the absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) were sheared, they rapidly depolymerized, recovered, and reassembled. The mean length of the recovered microtubules was the same as that observed just before shearing, implying that on average one fragment per original microtubule survived the fragmentation and recovery. When microtubules that contained 25 percent brain MAP were sheared, the fragments did not depolymerize extensively and the average length of the fragments decreased by a factor of 3 relative to the unsheared sample. The results support the dynamic instability model, which predicts that cellular microtubules are latently unstable structures protected on their ends by stabilizing caps.",Excluded
2019,"Neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in a psychopathological animal model are suggestive of antidepressant-like effects. The neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) were investigated in two rat lines selectively bred for high and low anxiety-related behavior. The stimulation parameters were adjusted according to the results of accurate computer-assisted and magnetic resonance imaging-based reconstructions of the current density distributions induced by rTMS in the rat and human brain, ensuring comparable stimulation patterns in both cases. Adult male rats were treated in two 3-day series under halothane anesthesia. In the forced swim test, rTMS-treatment induced a more active coping strategy in the high anxiety-related behavior rats only (time spent struggling; 332% vs. controls), allowing these animals to reach the performance of low anxiety-related behavior rats. In contrast, rTMS-treated low anxiety-related behavior rats did not change their swimming behavior. The development of active coping strategies in high anxiety-related behavior rats was accompanied by a significantly attenuated stress-induced elevation of plasma corticotropin and corticosterone concentrations. In summary, the behavioral and neuroendocrine effects of rTMS of frontal brain regions in high anxiety-related behavior rats are comparable to the effects of antidepressant drug treatment. Interestingly, in the psychopathological animal model repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induced changes in stress coping abilities in the high-anxiety line only.",Excluded
2020,"Systemic HDAC3 inhibition ameliorates impairments in synaptic plasticity caused by simulated galactic cosmic radiation exposure in male mice. Deep space travel presents a number of measurable risks including exposure to a spectrum of radiations of varying qualities, termed galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) that are capable of penetrating the spacecraft, traversing through the body and impacting brain function. Using rodents, studies have reported that exposure to simulated GCR leads to cognitive impairments associated with changes in hippocampus function that can persist as long as one-year post exposure with no sign of recovery. Whether memory can be updated to incorporate new information in mice exposed to GCR is unknown. Further, mechanisms underlying long lasting impairments in cognitive function as a result of GCR exposure have yet to be defined. Here, we examined whether whole body exposure to simulated GCR using 6 ions and doses of 5 or 30 cGy interfered with the ability to update an existing memory or impact hippocampal synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism believed to underlie memory processes, by examining long term potentiation (LTP) in acute hippocampal slices from middle aged male mice 3.5-5 months after radiation exposure. Using a modified version of the hippocampus-dependent object location memory task developed by our lab termed ""Objects in Updated Locations"" (OUL) task we find that GCR exposure impaired hippocampus-dependent memory updating and hippocampal LTP 3.5-5 months after exposure. Further, we find that impairments in LTP are reversed through one-time systemic subcutaneous injection of the histone deacetylase 3 inhibitor RGFP 966 (10 mg/kg), suggesting that long lasting impairments in cognitive function may be mediated at least in part, through epigenetic mechanisms.",Included

Purpose or Objective The role of APBI for patients with low-risk breast cancer has gained popularity as an alternative to the conventional whole breast irradiation (WBI) with external beam radiation. Multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy with flexible catheters located around the lumpectomy cavity is one of the oldest APBI techniques with the longest experience. The aim of the study was to report the results of 218 patients with at least 5-year follow-up treated with APBI using interstitial multicatheter high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) after breast-conserving surgery. Material and Methods From July 2006 to October 2017, 443 women with lowrisk invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ after BCS underwent APBI using interstitial multicatheter HDR brachytherapy at our department. In the analyzed group, 218 patients were followed up for 5 years or longer. The inclusion criteria were: ZUBROD 0 or 1, age <sup>3</sup>50 years, T1-2N0M0, T<=3cm, unifocally, invasive carcinoma without neuroinvasion, angioinvasion, minimal surgical margin 2mm or DCIS with minimal margin at least 5mm, without EIC (extensive intraductal component), positive estrogen receptors. The time between surgery and HDR-BT was more than 12 weeks. 78% of the analyzed patients underwent APBI under local anesthesia. The total dose was 32Gy in 8 fractions delivered twice-daily with a minimum 6-hour break. The primary endpoint was local recurrence. Results The median age was 62 years (range 47-86 years). All patients completed treatment without interruptions. There were no serious complications during the procedure. In 18% of the patients a hematoma following catheter insertion was noticed, which typically resolved within 2 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated. Near 2% of the patients developed local inflammation, requiring oral antibiotic therapy. In almost 20% of cases, prophylactic antibiotic therapy was applied. PTV range was 17.1-175cm<sup>3</sup>.

2022,"Localization and identification of concurrent sounds in the owl's auditory space map. In nature, sounds from multiple sources sum at the eardrums, generating complex cues for sound localization and identification. In this clutter, the auditory system must determine ""what is where."" We examined this process in the auditory space map of the barn owl's (Tyto alba) inferior colliculus using two spatially separated sources simultaneously emitting uncorrelated noise bursts, which were uniquely identified by different frequencies of sinusoidal amplitude modulation. Spatial response profiles of isolated neurons were constructed by testing the source-pair centered at various locations in virtual auditory space. The neurons responded whenever a source was placed within the receptive field, generating two clearly segregated foci of activity at appropriate loci. The spike trains were locked strongly to the amplitude modulation of the source within the receptive field, whereas the other source had minimal influence. Two sources amplitude modulated at the same rate were resolved successfully, suggesting that source separation is based on differences of fine structure. The spike rate and synchrony were stronger for whichever source had the stronger average binaural level. A computational model showed that neuronal activity was primarily proportional to the degree of matching between the momentary binaural cues and the preferred values of the neuron. The model showed that individual neurons respond to and synchronize with sources in their receptive field if there are frequencies having an average binaural-level advantage over a second source. Frequencies with interaural phase differences that are shared by both sources may also evoke activity, which may be synchronized with the amplitude modulations from either source.",Excluded

Studies of the in vivo multiplication of an attenuated temperature-sensitive strain of vaccinia virus (ts2) indicated that temperature sensitivity alone could not account for the attenuation. Immunodepressive treatment of intracerebrally inoculated mice had a dramatic stimulatory effect on the multiplication of the attenuated strain and suggested that establishment of ts2 infection in the mice was hindered by host defense mechanisms mediated by cellular elements. Experiments carried out in vitro with the 51Cr release assay showed that cells infected with the ts2 mutant represented more susceptible targets to the cytotoxic action of immune spleen cells than cells infected with the parent vaccinia strain. Moreover, it appeared that ts2 replication, compared with wild-type replication in vitro, was more inhibited by the immune spleen cells. Although this work did not evaluate the role of specifically sensitized lymphocytes within the lesions, indirect evidence suggests that lymphocytes could cause a more effective halt in ts2 virus multiplication than in wild-type multiplication.",Excluded
2025,"Stereotactic irradiation of the postoperative resection cavity for brain metastasis: a frameless linear accelerator-based case series and review of the technique. PURPOSE: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the standard of care after resection of a brain metastasis. However, concern regarding possible neurocognitive effects and the lack of survival benefit with this approach has led to the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity in place of WBRT. We report our initial experience using an image-guided linear accelerator-based frameless stereotactic system and review the technical issues in applying this technique.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the setup accuracy, treatment outcome, and patterns of failure of the first 18 consecutive cases treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The target volume was the resection cavity without a margin excluding the surgical track.RESULTS: The median number of brain metastases per patient was 1 (range, 1-3). The median planning target volume was 3.49 mL. The median prescribed dose was 18 Gy (range, 15-18 Gy) with normalization ranging from 68% to 85%. In all cases, 99% of the planning target volume was covered by the prescribed dose. The median conformity index was 1.6 (range, 1.41-1.92). The SRS was delivered with submillimeter accuracy. At a median follow-up of 12.7 months, local control was achieved in 16/18 cavities treated. True local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. No marginal failures occurred. Distant recurrence occurred in 6/17 patients. Median time to any failure was 7.4 months. No Grade 3 or higher toxicity was recorded. A long interval between initial cancer diagnosis and the development of brain metastasis was the only factor that trended toward a significant association with the absence of recurrence (local or distant) (log-rank p = 0.097).CONCLUSIONS: Frameless stereotactic irradiation of the resection cavity after surgery for a brain metastasis is a safe and accurate technique that offers durable local control and defers the use of WBRT in select patients.

The N1 or N2 feeding interneurons in the buccal ganglia were filled with the fluorescent dye 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF) from the cut end of the nerve that contains their axon. Filling the cerebrobuccal connective (N = 151) stained just one N1 cell in the contralateral buccal ganglion. Filling the postbuccal nerve stained neurons symmetrically in both buccal ganglia (N = 75): only one labeled cell in each ganglion is an N2 interneuron. The feeding rhythm was evoked by depolarizing a modulatory neuron, the SO, located in the buccal ganglia. The axonally filled N1 interneuron was irradiated at its axon in the buccal commissure with blue laser light (intensity of 0.5 MW.m-2). Irradiation of just one N1 completely blocked the feeding rhythm (seven preparations). In seven further preparations, N1 ablation slowed the SO-driven feeding rhythm and weakened the N1 input to the feeding neurons. Irradiation of the cell bodies of both the filled left and right N2 interneurons killed the cells but did not produce any consistent change in the feeding rate (15 preparations). The feeding interneurons and motoneurons still showed the characteristic N2 phase synaptic inputs, so more, as yet unidentified, N2 neurons must be located in other parts of the buccal ganglia. We conclude that the participation of the identified N1 interneurons is essential for the normal feeding pattern while other, still to be identified N2 neurons must be present and must contribute to the feeding rhythm. We suggest that the extra redundancy of the N2 network may be related to the greater necessity of sensory feedback control during rasping than during protraction of the radula.",Excluded
2030,"Current concepts in the management of erectile dysfunction in men with prostate cancer. Development in the management of prostate cancer has placed increased attention on patient quality of life after treatment, particularly sexual function. The incidence of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men following radical prostatectomy has been estimated to range from 16% to 82%. Several factors determine the postoperative incidence of erectile difficulties; these include patient age, degree of cavernosal nerve sparing during surgery, cancer stage, and associated comorbidities. Early initiation of available treatments after radical prostatectomy, such as phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and intracavernosal alprostadil, may improve the speed and degree of recovery of erectile function. Oral PDE-5 inhibitors are recognized as the first line of therapy for men with ED after radical prostatectomy, with reasonable success rates reported for all commercially available PDE-5 inhibitors. In recognition of the neurogenic basis for erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy, new strategies have been devised, such as cavernous nerve graft interposition procedures, perioperative neuroprotection measures, and postoperative neurotrophic treatments. Hopefully, these efforts will improve quality of life for patients with prostate cancer. The aim of this article is to review the current modalities of ED management for men with prostate cancer.

Direct comparison of the cell age of 9L and KHT tumour cells derived either from tissue culture or solid tumours was achieved. Cells from dissociated KHT and 9L tumours (the latter implanted either subcutaneously or intracerebrally) and cells from tissue culture were separated into homogenous sized populations by centrifugal elutriation. In both tumour models these homogeneous sized populations correspond to populations enriched at different stages of the cell cycle. The survival of these elutriated cell populations was measured after a single dose of Cs-137 gamma rays. For cells isolated from 9L solid tumours, there was little variation in radiosensitivity throughout the cell cycle; however, a very small but significant increase in resistance was found in late G<inf>1</inf> cells. This lack of a large variation in radiosensitivity through the cell cycle for 9L cells from solid tumours also was seen in 9L cells growing in monolayer tissue culture. When similar experiments were performed using the KHT sarcoma tumour model, the results showed that KHT cells in vitro exhibited a fairly conventional increase in radioresistance in both mid G<inf>1</inf> and late S.

Tests of standing and walking steadiness were administered along with cognitive and motor performance tests to Navy and Marine Corps aviators before and after their regular simulator training, resulting in records of 726 pilot exposure observations. When exposed pilots were compared to a control group who did not fly in a simulator, statistically significant decrements in postural equilibrium test scores were found for all of the moving base simulators, but for only one of the three fixed-base simulators. The size of these losses was approximately 15% of baseline. Cognitive and motor changes, while statistically significant, were complicated by learning effects in all groups for all tests. When compared to the control group, improvement in cognitive scores was always less in the simulator groups, but greater improvement occurred in the simulator groups for motor speed scores, although this latter difference was small (<1% of baseline).

Using cylindrical phantom divided into six compartments filled with various radioactivities, the linear correlation between SPECT value and radioactivity, and also correlation with partial reduction of radioactivity were identified. But the SPECT value was relatively increased in proportion to the reduction of radioactivity due to the increase of scattering contribution. The SPECT value represented lower radioactivity when the cortical thickness was smaller than two times of FWHM and represented half radioactivity when the cortical thickness was equal to FWHM. Excellent correlation between SPECT value and radioactive partial volume averaging of brain with CSF was recognized using our hand made phantom simulating various degree of atrophic brain.

Overall median survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.8-12). Survival was longer (p < 0.001) in the radiation + chemotherapy group (median: 14.2 months, 95% CI 11.7-17.1) compared to radiation alone (median: 5.7 months, 95% CI 3.7-12) and no postoperative treatment (median: 1.8 months, 95% CI 1.4-4) groups. In multivariable analysis, increasing age was associated with worse survival (HR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.47-2.37, p < 0.001), whereas radiation + chemotherapy was associated with lower mortality compared to radiation alone (HR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98, p = 0.038). In subgroup analysis, postoperative chemotherapy with radiation was associated with significant survival benefit compared to radiation alone for grade IV (HR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76, p = 0.003), but not for grade III tumors (HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.48-1.58, p = 0.65).CONCLUSION: Analysis from a national registry illustrated the effectiveness of radiation with chemotherapy for adult patients with high-grade brainstem gliomas, particularly grade IV. Further research should identify specific patient profiles and molecular subgroups that are more likely to benefit from multimodality therapy.",Included
2036,"Effect of whole-body gamma irradiation on lipid peroxidation in rat tissues. In this work, we studied the influence of whole-body gamma irradiation (800 rads) upon malonaldehyde (MDA) content in plasma, erythrocyte, brain, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, liver, thymus and bone marrow. MDA levels were increased in all studied samples, except lung; the highest increases were observed in the most radiosensitive organs (bone marrow, thymus, spleen) and not in those continuously exposed to high concentrations of molecular oxygen (lungs, erythrocytes). Comparison of the variations of MDA levels in plasma, kidneys and spleen to those in the other tissues lead to the hypothesis that MDA is released from tissues in plasma and trapped from plasma in kidney and spleen. The variations in plasma and erythrocyte were found not to be related to each other.",Included
2037,"Impacts of Microgravity Analogs to Spaceflight on Cerebral Autoregulation. It is well known that exposure to microgravity in astronauts leads to a plethora physiological responses such as headward fluid shift, body unloading, and cardiovascular deconditioning. When astronauts return to Earth, some encounter problems related to orthostatic intolerance. An impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA), which could be compromised by the effects of microgravity, has been proposed as one of the mechanisms responsible for orthostatic intolerance. CA is a homeostatic mechanism that maintains cerebral blood flow for any variations in cerebral perfusion pressure by adapting the vascular tone and cerebral vessel diameter. The ground-based models of microgravity are useful tools for determining the gravitational impact of spaceflight on human body. The head-down tilt bed rest (HDTBR), where the subject remains in supine position at -6 degrees for periods ranging from few days to several weeks is the most commonly used ground-based model of microgravity for cardiovascular deconditioning. head-down bed rest (HDBR) is able to replicate cephalic fluid shift, immobilization, confinement, and inactivity. Dry immersion (DI) model is another approach where the subject remains immersed in thermoneutral water covered with an elastic waterproof fabric separating the subject from the water. Regarding DI, this analog imitates absence of any supporting structure for the body, centralization of body fluids, immobilization and hypokinesia observed during spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of microgravity on CA. Here, we review the fundamental principles and the different mechanisms involved in CA. We also consider the different approaches in order to assess CA. Finally, we focus on the effects of short- and long-term spaceflight on CA and compare these findings with two specific analogs to microgravity: HDBR and DI.",Excluded

2039,"PAK4 governs radiation-induced endothelial GRO-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling and angiogenesis in glioma. Aberrant neovascularization is a pathological hallmark of glioblastoma that correlates with poor clinical outcome. Factors that drive endothelial proliferation, recruitment into the tumor and angiogenesis in the context of radiotherapy are potentially novel therapeutic targets for glioma. Our studies showed high expression of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in gliomas; analyses of conditioned medium (CM) prepared from shRNA-mediated PAK4-knockdown (PAK4.sh) glioma cells using a human angiogenesis array showed a significant downregulation in key angiogenic factors including Gro-1alpha. Treatment of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) with CM from PAK4.sh-cells significantly inhibited endothelial proliferation, migration and microtubule formation compared with controls. PAK4.sh-CM treatment also suppressed CXCR2 receptor activation and decreased the expression levels of p-Stat3, MMP-2 and cyclin D1 in HBMECs. Ionizing radiation (IR, 8 Gy) activated Gro-1alpha-CXCR2 signaling in HBMECs, and induced high levels of endothelial capillary network formation on matrigel. On the other hand, PAK4.sh inhibited IR-induced angiogenesis by decreasing Gro-1alpha and CXCR2 levels in HBMECS. Further, in vivo experiments with orthotopic intracranial tumors in nude mice showed growth suppression in PAK4.sh tumors compared to control tumors. Immunohistochemical analyses of brain tumor sections showed a significant decrease in MMP-2 in PAK4.sh tumors. In summary, our studies emphasize a novel role of PAK4 as a critical mediator of tumor-endothelial cell interactions via Gro-1alpha-CXCR2signaling, and in vivo tumor growth suppression by PAK4 depletion indicates its therapeutic potential in the treatment of glioma.",Included
2040,"Crosstalk of ERBB2 with lef1 regulates jagged1-mediated radioresistance in glioblastoma. ErbB2 (Her2) belongs to the family of EGF receptor tyrosine kinases and plays a vital oncogenic role in several cancers. Gliomas are reported to have aberrant overexpression of ErbB2, but its role in glioma biology and treatment resistance have not been well studied. We have previously reported that ionizing radiation (IR) increases cell invasiveness and radioresistance. In our preliminary studies, we observed that shRNA mediated ErbB2 silencing in glioma cell lines resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation and invasion which was associated with a suppression of Notch signaling. To examine its role in radioresistance, we treated glioma cells with IR and observed that the cells exhibited a significant increase in invasiveness associated with nuclear translocation of ErbB2 and transcriptional upregulation of the Notch receptor ligand, Jagged-1. To further investigate the relationship between ErbB2 translocation and Notch signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation and transcription factor binding array studies in IR-treated cells which revealed an interesting association of nuclear ErbB2 with the TCF1/ LEF1 complex that is known to transcriptionally regulate Jagged-1 expression. In addition, chromatin-binding assays showed recruitment of ErbB2 to putative LEF1 consensus sites of the Jagged-1 promoter, suggesting a potential role for ErbB2 in the transcriptional regulation of Jagged-1 and consequently of Notch signaling after radiation in glioma cells. Further, downregulation of ErbB2 inhibited Notch signaling and decreased IR-induced invasion in these cells. These in vitro findings were further validated in an orthotopic intracranial glioma model that showed significant growth inhibition of intracranial ErbB2. shRNA-tumors compared to controls. Our results suggest a novel role for nuclear ErbB2 in regulating Jagged1/Notch1-signaling mediated cell invasion in IR treated cells, and provide a potential strategy for targeting ErbB2-mediated Notch signaling to overcome radioresistance in gliomas.",Excluded
2041,"Radiation as a local ablative therapy option for oligoprogressive EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with osimertinib. Purpose/Objective(s): Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved response rate and survival in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their efficacy is limited by acquired resistance and disease progression. Local ablative therapy (LAT) has shown a survival benefit in patients with oligometastatic disease in retrospective studies. At our institution, we are conducting a prospective single-arm Phase 2 study of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI. Following LAT to the sites of progression with either radiation or surgery, patients are re-initiated on osimertinib. The primary endpoints are safety, tolerability, and efficacy of re-initiation of osimertinib, as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS). We hypothesize that osimertinib and radiation can be safely administered sequentially, and that LAT followed by re-initiation of osimertinib will result in improved PFS. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with no prior EGFR-TKI exposure (cohort 1) or progression after 1st/2nd generation EGFR-TKIs with acquired T790M mutation (cohort 2) receive osimertinib. Upon progression, eligible patients with <=5 progressing sites undergo LAT by either radiation therapy or surgery, then resume osimertinib until further disease progression. Patients previously treated with osimertinib with disease progression who qualify for LAT are also eligible (cohort 3). Prior to beginning radiation, patients must be off osimertinib for at least 2 wks, and total time off osimertinib must be less than 8 wks. Result(s): Fifteen patients with a median age of 57 (range 36-71) were enrolled between 4/2016 and 1/2017 (cohorts 1/2/3: 9/3/3 patients). Overall, treatment has been well tolerated, with rash, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and alanine transaminase elevation the most common adverse events (AEs). Grade 3-4 AEs were observed in 4 (27%) patients. Objective response rates among evaluable patients prior to LAT in cohorts 1 and 2 were 71% (5/7) and 100% (2/2), respectively. Median PFS was 6.8 mo (95% CI: 3.4 mo-undefined) in cohort 1; there have been no progressions in cohort 2. To date, 2/5 patients receiving LAT have received radiation (both in cohort 3). One patient received 5 Gy x 5 to 2 lung lesions, while the other received 24 Gy and 18 Gy by stereotactic radiosurgery to 2 brain metastases. Additional endpoints include assessment of mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib by multi-omics analyses of tumor, blood, and saliva; results from these analyses will also be presented. Conclusion(s): Oligoprogressive disease can be safely treated with LAT, including radiation therapy, in patients with limited metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC after EGFR-TKI therapy. This approach could potentially prevent premature switching to other, less-effective systemic therapies by maximizing the duration and efficacy of EGFR-TKI treatment in selected patients.",Excluded
2042,"The Role of Advanced Imaging in Assessing Response to Definitive Chemoradiation Before Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer. We examined the responses to chemoradiation according to imaging modality in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Provided patients achieved at least a partial response, advanced imaging response neither affected survival nor added information to the decision to offer prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), suggesting that limited-stage SCLC patients with partial response using any imaging modality should not be denied PCI. Introduction: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) improves survival for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Evidence for PCI in limited-stage SCLC largely derives from studies requiring only chest x-ray (CXR) to determine remission status. We analyzed thoracic chemoradiation therapy (TCRT) outcomes according to imaging modality to determine which patients benefitted most from PCI. Patients and Methods: All limited-stage SCLC patients who received TCRT as well as PCI at our institution were reviewed. Imaging between TCRT end and PCI start was characterized as complete (CR), partial (PR), or other response. Result(s): Thirty-eight consecutive patients were assessed for TCRT response before PCI with CXR (n = 21), chest computed tomography (CT; n = 27), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (n = 11). CR was identified on 71% of CXRs, 41% of CT scans, and 18% of PET/CT scans. Median survival was 28.3 months for the entire cohort and did not differ for patients who had CXR alone versus CT and/or PET/CT for restaging (P =.78) or those with PR using any modality versus CR using all modalities (22.6 months vs. 45.5 months; P =.22). CT CR patients had numerical but not statistically significant improved 2-year (P =.18) and 3-year (P =.13) survival compared with CT PR. Conclusion(s): CXR remains an appropriate modality to assess TCRT response before PCI in limited-stage SCLC. Advanced imaging did not inform the decision to offer PCI in this study. Because of similar excellent survival profiles independent of imaging modality and TCRT response, this analysis suggests limited-stage SCLC patients with PR using any modality should not be denied PCI, akin to standards for extensive-stage SCLC.

2044,"Ondansetron and azithromycin: A common combination that can cause QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Case Reports: Ondansetron is a commonly used antiemetic medication which received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 19911. On September 9, 2011 the FDA announced an ongoing safety review of ondansetron due to suspicion of increasing the risk of abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart2. The FDA received numerous reports of patients taking ondansetron with abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) changes including the potentially fatal cardiac rhythm torsade de pointes2. Ondansetron labeling was updated to warn against prescribing in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. GlaxoSmith Kline, the manufacturer of Zofran, will publish results in the summer of 2012 of an ongoing study investigating the likelihood of ondansetron prolonging the QT interval2. The FDA and manufacturer recommend monitoring electrocardiograms on patients at high risk of arrhythmias1, 2. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has fewer case reports of QT interval prolongation after administration3, 4. Other macrolide antibiotics have been associated with QT interval prolongation but the manufacturer currently does not recommend monitoring electrocardiograms in patients receiving azithromycin1. However in April 2012, a recent study concluded azithromycin had a marginal increase in deaths secondary to cardiovascular causes compared to no antibiotics and treatment with amoxicillin5. In this case, a young female with no known history of structural cardiac disease has a cardiac arrest after receiving multiple doses of ondansetron and azithromycin.A 20 year old female presented to an outside hospital with a one week history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was transferred to our hospital on 9/11/2011 with persistent nausea and elevated liver function tests. She reported resolution of vomiting and diarrhea but felt weak and lethargic and complained of mild bilateral knee pain with no recent trauma. She also complained of sore throat and mild left ear discomfort. Upon presentation on 9/11/2011, she had significant transaminitis with ALT of 2644 U/L, AST of 1647 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 191 U/L. The patient had a total protein of 4.7 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL, TSH of 20.797 uIU/mL, sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 5.8 mmol/L, chloride of 89 mmol/L, and bicarbonate of 19 mmol/L, creatinine of 17.1 mg/dL, and calcium of 6.3 mg/dL. Four milligrams of intravenous ondansetron was administered at an outside emergency room on 9/10/2011 at 22:50. Figure 1 shows rhythm strips prior to the patient experiencing cardiac arrest. She has an extensive past medical history which consists of metastatic thyroid cancer status post thyroidectomy and I-331 radiation, idiopathic end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, community acquired pneumonia, anemia, renal osteodystrophy, hypertension, parathyroidectomy and malnutrition. On 9/11/2011, the patient received four doses of intravenous ondansetron 4 mg at 01:37, 09:21, 15:06, and 23:16. On 9/12/2011, the transaminitis continued with ALT of 2587 U/L, AST of 2121 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 217 U/L, total protein of 4.2 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, sodium of 130 mmol/L, potassium of 6.3 mmol/L, chloride of 88 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, creatinine of 16.7 mg/dL, and calcium of 5.7 mg/dL. The first dose of intravenous azithromycin 500 milligrams was given at 13:28 for possible community acquired pneumonia. At 14:00, the patient had cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation after development of sudden-onset bradycardia and profound hypotension. Cardiac rhythms from this cardiac arrest are included in Figure 2. The patient received CPR, two doses of atropine, two doses of epinephrine, and one dose of calcium chloride with brief return of spontaneous pulses. Patient was intubated, dopamine infusion began, and ventricular fibrillation developed. She was shocked once and given sodium bicarbonate. The cardiac arrest lasted twenty-five minutes and she was transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient did not receive any other oses of ondansetron. Antibiotics were broadened to include: azithromycin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and linezolid. On 9/13/2011, transaminitis persisted with ALT of 1682 U/L, AST of 712 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 185 U/L, total protein of 3.5 g/dL, and total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL. Other abnormal labs included sodium of 131 mmol/L, potassium of 4.8 mmol/L, chloride of 90 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 23 mmol/L, creatinine of 16 mg/dL, and calcium of 6.4 mg/dL (ionized calcium 0.79). Azithromycin 500 milligrams was administered intravenously at 12:09. Within the next hour, the nurse noted the patient to have large and dilated pupils and increased decerebrate posturing. Bradycardia with ventricular tachycardia resulting in pulseless electrical activity was recorded at 13:14. Figure 3 depicts rhythms from this timeframe. The code began at 13:15 with dopamine infusion and boluses of atropine, epinephrine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. She went into ventricular fibrillation and was shocked. The patient had return of spontaneous circulation with sustained ventricular tachycardia after several minutes. Azithromycin was discontinued and electrolytes were corrected. An EKG was taken on 9/13/2011 at 19:09 which showed a corrected QT interval of 499 milliseconds. She did not receive any more doses of ondansetron or azithromycin throughout the admission. CT scan of the head was negative for any acute findings.After the two codes, the patient recovered from anoxic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, and shock liver. Electrolytes were corrected daily if needed to avoid repeat cardiac arrests. After correction of electrolytes and discontinuation of azithromycin, the patient's QT interval remained prolonged. It is noted later that she had a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram from a previous admission (3/9/2011) which showed a corrected QT interval of 538 milliseconds. She received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator during this admission. DiscussionA normal QT interval depends on the balance of sodium and potassium in the heart6. QT prolongation results if cardiac potassium channels are blocked while QRS widening results when sodium channels in the heart are blocked7, 8. HERG is the cardiac potassium channel responsible for the rapid repolarizing current (IKr)7. The QT interval is influenced by the rapid repolarizing current produced by HERG as well as the slow repolarizing current produced by a different cardiac potassium channel KvLQT1 7. Blockage of sodium channels lengthens depolarization and repolarization of the action potential9 which leads to lengthening of the QRS. Patients with prolonged corrected QT intervals greater than 450 milliseconds in men and 460 milliseconds in women are at increased risk of developing arrhythmias6. As the lengthening occurs, the risk of torsade de pointes and ventricular arrythmias increases6.Known risk factors for the lengthening of the QT interval include patients with underlying heart conditions include: 9, 10, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia10,6, concomitant QT-prolonging medications10, 9, bradycardia9, 10, and female gender9. Medications that increase the QT interval include: macrolides (erythromycin and clarithromycin), droperidol, selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, 5-HT antagonists, antipsychotics, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, tacrolimus, voriconazole10, and now more recently brought to the attention by the FDA are 5-HT3 antagonists.This female patient had several comorbidities including: 6, 9 chronic renal failure11, 12,13, hypothyroidism14 and electrolyte abnormalities6, 10, 9 that can lead to prolonged QT interval and ventricular arrythmias. Because of her young age and lack of cardiac history, her previous prolonged QT interval may have been over looked. In addition to her comorbidities, concomitant medications such as ondansetron and azithromycin, which prolong the QT interval, could have resulted in her cardiac arrest. For years droperidol was commonly used for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) but was found to cause significant QT interval prolongation15. Droperidol is believed to cause QT interval prolongation by blocking the HERG potassium (IK) channel9. Droperidol received a black box warning in 2001 for the potential of QT prolongation and induction of arrhythmias9. In order to avoid this risk of QT interval prolongation and other side effects of droperidol, 5-HT3 antagonists became first-line agents for prevention and treatment of PONV15. After increased usage of ondansetron and other 5-HT3 antagonists, more reports of increased QT prolongation have emerged2. Ondansetron has been shown to block sodium channels which widens the QRS and the cardiac HERG potassium (IK) channel which prolongs the QT interval9. The impact of QT prolongation by droperidol and ondansetron has been compared in a nonrandomized fashion. A study of 16 patients determined that both droperidol and ondansetron increase the QT interval alone and in combination with each other16. In a study of 85 patients with PONV, droperidol 0.75 mg intravenously and ondansetron 4 mg intravenously produced similar QT interval prolongation15. No patients received any other QT interval-prolonging medications. Forty-three patients received 0.75 milligrams of droperidol intravenously while forty-two patients received 4 milligrams of ondansetron intravenously when PONV was experienced. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at baseline and then 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after medication administration. Although the study was nonrandomized, the electrocardiograms were analyzed after completion of the study by one blinded investigator.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Brain metastases are a common preterminal event in patients with metastatic melanoma and require radiation therapy. Our group has previously shown that human GRM1 (hGRM1) expressing melanoma cells release excess extracellular glutamate and are growth inhibited by riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release. Riluzole-treated cells accumulate in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle at 24 hours, and then undergo apoptotic cell death. We evaluated whether riluzole enhanced radiosensitivity in melanoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clonogenic assays were performed to evaluate clonogenic survival after treatment in hGRM1 expressing and nonexpressing melanoma cells. Western immunoblots were performed to confirm apoptotic cell death. A xenograft mouse model was used to validate the in vitro experiments. Tumors harvested from the xenografts were fixed and stained for apoptosis and DNA damage markers.RESULTS: In the hGRM1-positive cell lines C8161 and UACC903, riluzole enhanced the lethal effects of ionizing radiation; no difference was seen in the hGRM1-negative UACC930 cell line. C8161 cells treated with riluzole plus irradiation also showed the highest levels of the cleaved forms of PARP and caspase-3; excised C8161 xenografts showed the greatest number of apoptotic cells by immunohistochemistry (P < 0.001). On cell cycle analysis, a sequence-dependent enrichment in the G(2)/M phase was shown with the combination of riluzole and irradiation. Xenografts treated with riluzole and weekly radiation fractions showed significant growth inhibition and revealed markedly increased DNA damage.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown, in vitro and in vivo, that the combination of riluzole and ionizing radiation leads to greater cytotoxicity. These results have clinical implications for patients with brain metastases receiving whole brain radiation therapy.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To report our 20 yr experience of definitive radiotherapy for early glottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiation records of 141 patients were retrospectively evaluated for patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Cox proportional hazard models were used to perform univariate (UVA) and multivariate analyses (MVA). Cause specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were plotted using cumulative incidence and Kaplan-Meir curves, respectively.RESULTS: Of the 91% patients that presented with impaired voice, 73% noted significant improvement. Chronic laryngeal edema and dysphagia were noted in 18% and 7%, respectively. The five year LC was 94% (T1a), 83% (T1b), 87% (T2a), 65% (T2b); the ten year LC was 89% (T1a), 83% (T1b), 87% (T2a), and 53% (T2b). The cumulative incidence of death due to larynx cancer at 10 yrs was 5.5%, respectively. On MVA, T-stage, heavy alcohol consumption during treatment, and used of weighted fields were predictive for poor outcome (p < 0.05). The five year CSS and OS was 95.9% and 76.8%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Definitive radiotherapy provides excellent LC and CSS for early glottis carcinoma, with excellent voice preservation and minimal long term toxicity. Alternative management strategies should be pursued for T2b glottis carcinomas.",Excluded

Thermal ablation via high-intensity continuous exposure generates coagulative necrosis of tissues. High-intensity, pulsed application reduces temporally averaged energy deposition, resulting in mechanical effects, including reversible, localized BBB disruption, which enhances neurotherapeutic agent delivery.

Cryotherapy (cryo) is a modality used for tumor ablation. It has also been successfully used in treatment of benign bleeding such as radiation proctitis and gastric antral vascular ectasia. There is one case report of cryo use in refractory GIMB leading to short term hemostasis (HS). We present a case of long term HS achieved by cryo in a patient with refractory GIMB. A 51 year old male with a history of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presented with melena. He was successfully treated with APC and was then referred for external beam radiation to prevent further bleeding. This combination achieved HS for around 8 months after which he presented with recurrent melena. A second attempt at treatment with APC achieved initial hemostasis but bleeding recurred 2 days later. Cryo was offered to him to aid with his dysphagia and possibly hemostasis. On EGD a fungating tumor oozing blood was seen in the distal third of the esophagus. Cryo was performed with 15 second freeze cycles. The patient experienced significant improvement in his dysphagia and resolution of his melena. The patient expired 2 months later due to newly diagnosed brain metastasis without recurrence of his melena. ET of GIMB continues to be a challenge. Multiple modalities can be tried including standard hemostatic maneuvers. Bleeding often recurs and can become refractory. Hemospray has been reported to be effective in these situations but is not available in the United States. Cryo, proven effective in refractory benign bleeding and approved for tumor ablation was used successfully in this patient. Cryo effect at standard application duration is limited to the superficial 5 mm of tissue. In addition to tumor necrosis has the theoretical advantage of forming crystal in the microvasculature leading to thrombosis and possibly hemostasis. This is a case of long term hemostasis achieved by cryotherapy in a patient with refractory tumor bleeding. A prospective study is needed to determine whether these effects can be reproduced in other patients. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
2056,"Similarity pattern analysis in mutational distributions. The validity and applicability of the statistical procedure - similarity pattern analysis (SPAN) - to the study of mutational distributions (MDs) was demonstrated with two sets of data. The first was mutational spectra (MS) for 697 GC to AT transitions produced with eight alkylating agents (AAs) in the lacI gene of Escherichia coli. The second was a recently summarized data on the distributions of 11562 spontaneous, radiation- and chemical-induced forward mutations in the ad-3 region of heterokaryon 12 of Neurospora crassa. They were analyzed as large two-way contingency tables (CTs) where two kinds of profiles were compared: site (or genotypic class) profiles and origin (or mutagen) profiles. To measure similarity (homogeneity) between any pair of profiles, the relevant sufficient statistics, Kastenbaum-Hirotsu squared distance (KHi<sup>2</sup>), was used. Collapsing the similar profiles into distinct internally homogeneous clusters named 'collapsets' revealed their similarity pattern. To facilitate the procedure, the computer program, COLLAPSE, was elaborated. The results of SPAN for the lacI spectra were found comparable with the results of their previous analysis with two multivariate statistical methods, the factor and cluster analyses. In the ad-3 data set, five collapsets were revealed among origin profiles (OPs): (I) ENU=4NQO=4HAQO=FANFT=SQ18506; (II) AF-2=EI=MMS=DEP; (III) ETO=UV; (IV) AHA=PROCARB; and (V) He ions=protons. Moreover, the previous observation that MDs are dose-dependent was confirmed for X-ray-induced MDs. Profiles induced with the low doses of X-rays are similar to that induced with <sup>85</sup>Sr, and profiles induced with the medium X-ray doses to those induced with protons and He ions. Evaluated similarities appear to be rather reasonable: mutagens with similar mode of action induce similar MDs. Similarity pattern revealed among genotypic class profiles (GCPs) seems to be also interpretable. When supplemented with descriptive cluster analysis, SPAN appears to be a fruitful methodology in MS analysis. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded

Until recently, the prognosis of patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM) was poor. In recent years, however, the prognosis has improved due to high-resolution imaging that facilitates early detection of small asymptomatic brain metastases and early intervention with local modalities such as stereotactic radiosurgery. More recently, a number of systemic therapies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for metastatic melanoma, resulting in improved survival for many MBM patients. Registration trials for these newer therapies excluded patients with untreated brain metastases, and a number of studies specifically tailored to this population of patients have been conducted or are underway. Herein, we review contemporary locoregional and systemic therapies and describe the unique challenges posed by treatment of brain metastases, such as radionecrosis, cerebral edema, and pseudoprogression. Since the number of systemic and combined modality clinical trials has increased, we expect that the treatment landscape for patients with melanoma brain metastasis will change dramatically. In addition to ongoing clinical trials, which show great promise, we conclude that our understanding of intracranial metastasis remains quite limited. In addition to inter-disciplinary, multi-modality studies, bench-side work to better understand the process of cerebrotropism is needed to fuel more drug development and further improve outcomes.

We summarize the results of gamma knife treatment for dural arterivenous fistula (DAVF), are report our study. Since the early 1990s, DAVFs have been treated in the same manner as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), i.e., by radiosurgery, performed with or without embolization. DAVFs in the cavernous sinus, transverse-sigmoid sinus, and cerebellar tent were treated with a marginal dose of 18 to 20 Gy. The current obliteration rates of DAVF reported in literature are not low when compared with those of AVM. Excellent DAVF obliteration rates were observed in our study, which were similar to those reported in the literature. In fact, complete response (CR) was observed in 9 cases, partial response (PR) in 9 cases, and partical obliteration in 6 cases during the mean follow-up of 27 months. Moreover, considerable neurological improvements were noted, which apparently began at an early stage post radiosurgery. Bleeding was observed 2 cases associated with cortical reflux during the follow-up. In conclusion, radiosurgery for DAVF is very useful for both the obliteration of the fistula and for the improvement of clinical signs. However, prior to performing radiosurgery, the lesions with cortical reflux should be interrupted by initially treated with surgery or embolization.",Excluded
2060,"Intraventricular glioblastoma-A rare localization of a common intracerebral tumor. Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents approx. 25% of all intracranial tumors in adults and is the most common primary brain tumor. In two thirds of cases, is the frontotemporal region affected, although this tumor can occur anywhere in the central nervous system. The intraventricular region as primary localization is extremely rare and only 29 cases have been reported, so far. Surgical gross total resection with concomitant radiation and chemotherapy is the standard therapy for best survival. Methods We report on six cases of histologically confirmed intraventricular GBM's who underwent biopsy or subtotal tumor resection at our department and were admitted between December 2015 and May 2016. Results All six cases with intraventricular mass underwent at least tumor biopsy to confirm the histology of GBM. The mean age was 58.2 +/- 15.7 years, the youngest patient was 26 years old. In terms of gender, there were 4 males and 2 females involved. The main clinical manifestations were neuropsychological deficits with personality changes, memory disorders and fatigue. Three patients presented with paresis, and one was symptomatic with headache and diffuse body pain. One patient presented with a fulminant loss of consciousness and was treated on the ICU for several days with an EVD. Four patients underwent biopsy only and two patients underwent craniotomy and subtotal tumor resection. All lesions were localized in the body of the lateral ventricle, in one case in the anterior horn, in another case in the central part of the lateral ventricle and in two cases in the posterior horn and the trigone. In the remaining two cases the tumor was found in the body of the inferior horn. The 2 patients who underwent surgery had the GBM localized in the posterior and the inferior horn and a parietooccipital approach over the trigone was used. Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy followed in 4 patients. Conclusion Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary brain tumor, but the intraventricular localization is very rare and has a rather poor prognosis due to the fact, that gross total resection mostly can not be achieved. Surgical removal might be attempted only if subtotal resection can be achieved.",Excluded

Glioblastoma (GBM) remains incurable, and recurrent tumors rarely respond to standard-of-care radiation and chemo-therapies.

We have developed a nanoparticle delivery vehicle that can stably bind and protect nucleic acids for specific delivery into brain tumor cells. These nanoparticles can deliver therapeutic siRNAs to sensitize GBM cells to radiotherapy and improve GBM treatment via systemic administration. We show that nanoparticle-mediated knockdown of the DNA repair protein apurinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1) sensitizes GBM cells to radiotherapy and extend survival in a genetic mouse model of GBM. Specific knockdown of Ape1 activity by 30% in brain tumor tissue doubled the extended survival achieved with radiotherapy alone.

2066,"Transcranial Doppler detection of microembolic signals during pulmonary vein antrum isolation: implications for titration of radiofrequency energy. BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular events are an important complication during pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI). Microembolic signals (MES) have been associated with stroke and neurological impairment. However, the incidence of MES during PVAI, and their relationship to microbubble formation and radiofrequency (RF) parameters are unknown.OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the relationship between MES, microbubble detection, and neurological outcome and the impact of RF titration strategy on these parameters.METHODS: We studied 202 patients in two groups undergoing PVAI using an intracardiac echocardiography (ICE)-guided technique. MES were detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) using insonation of the middle cerebral arteries. The number of microbubbles on ICE were qualitatively labeled as FEW, MODERATE, and SHOWER. In group I (n = 107), RF output was titrated to avoid microbubble formation and in group II (n = 95), standard power-limited RF output was used.RESULTS: TCD detected MES in all 202 patients during PVAI with an average of 1,793 +/- 547 per patient; 90% were detected during left atrial ablation. Over 85% of MES occurred after microbubbles. Group I patients had significantly lower numbers of MES (1,015 +/- 438 per patient) compared to group II patients (2,250 +/- 864 per patient) (P < 0.05). Group II also had a 3.1% incidence of acute neurological complications versus 0.9% in group I (P = 0.10). Patients with clinical events had significantly higher numbers of MES. There were no significant correlations between RF power, temperature, or impedence and MES number.CONCLUSIONS: MES directly correlate to the amount of microbubble formation on ICE, and may result in cerebroembolic complications. Titration of RF according to microbubble formation by ICE during PVAI may be important for minimizing the occurrence of MES and possibly acute neurological complications.",Excluded
2067,"X-ray and optical stereo-based 3D sensor fusion system for image-guided neurosurgery. Purpose: In neurosurgery, an image-guided operation is performed to confirm that the surgical instruments reach the exact lesion position. Among the multiple imaging modalities, an X-ray fluoroscope mounted on C- or O-arm is widely used for monitoring the position of surgical instruments and the target position of the patient. However, frequently used fluoroscopy can result in relatively high radiation doses, particularly for complex interventional procedures. The proposed system can reduce radiation exposure and provide the accurate three-dimensional (3D) position information of surgical instruments and the target position. Method(s): X-ray and optical stereo vision systems have been proposed for the C- or O-arm. Two subsystems have same optical axis and are calibrated simultaneously. This provides easy augmentation of the camera image and the X-ray image. Further, the 3D measurement of both systems can be defined in a common coordinate space. Result(s): The proposed dual stereoscopic imaging system is designed and implemented for mounting on an O-arm. The calibration error of the 3D coordinates of the optical stereo and X-ray stereo is within 0.1 mm in terms of the mean and the standard deviation. Further, image augmentation with the camera image and the X-ray image using an artificial skull phantom is achieved. Conclusion(s): As the developed dual stereoscopic imaging system provides 3D coordinates of the point of interest in both optical images and fluoroscopic images, it can be used by surgeons to confirm the position of surgical instruments in a 3D space with minimum radiation exposure and to verify whether the instruments reach the surgical target observed in fluoroscopic images.

2070,"Cost-Effectiveness of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Versus MRI Surveillance for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer. Purpose: Owing to conflicting prospective data, controversy exists regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PCI versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance for patients with ES-SCLC based on currently available evidence and in the context of the proposed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services alternative payment model. Methods and Materials: A Markov state transition model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing MRI surveillance alone with PCI for ES-SCLC. Clinical parameters were obtained from clinical trial data, and cost data were based on 2019 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and evaluated with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to consider model uncertainty. Result(s): In the base-case scenario, PCI was not cost-effective in this model, with an ICER of $168,456 per QALY gained compared with MRI surveillance alone, assuming that overall survival was 10 months for MRI surveillance alone and 12.5 months for PCI. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to the variation of overall survival and cognitive decline rates between the 2 groups. In a scenario analysis in which all patients received hippocampal-avoidance PCI, the model results became nearly cost-effective with PCI. Conclusion(s): PCI was not found to be cost-effective within this model compared with MRI surveillance alone, owing to the neurocognition decline effect of PCI based on available evidence. Hippocampal-avoidance PCI may be a potential cost-effective strategy for ES-SCLC, with confirmation expected after an ongoing prospective clinical trial (The Southwest Oncolology Group MRI Brain Surveillance Alone Versus MRI Surveillance And Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation [MAVERICK]), which includes assessments of cognitive function.

Multinomial logistic regression and one-way analyses of variance were used to examine the differences among subgroups.MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Depressed mood, cognitive disturbance, fatigue, insomnia, pain, and functional performance.FINDINGS: Patients were classified into four distinct subgroups based on their symptom cluster experience: all low symptom, high fatigue and low pain, high pain, and all high symptom. Such patient classification patterns were consistent across the treatment trajectory, although group memberships were inconsistent. After initiating treatment, two additional subgroups emerged: high depressed mood and cognitive disturbance, and high fatigue and insomnia.

2073,"Mechanisms of radiation-induced brain toxicity and implications for future clinical trials. Radiation therapy is widely used in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors and metastatic tumors of the brain with either curative or palliative intent. The limitation of cancer radiation therapy does not derive from the inability to ablate tumor, but rather to do so without excessively damaging the patient. Among the varieties of radiation-induced brain toxicities, it is the late delayed effects that lead to severe and irreversible neurological consequences. Following radiation exposure, late delayed effects within the CNS have been attributable to both parenchymal and vascular damage involving oligodendrocytes, neural progenitors, and endothelial cells. These reflect a dynamic process involving radiation-induced death of target cells and subsequent secondary reactive neuroinflammatory processes that are believed to lead to selective cell loss, tissue damage, and functional deficits. The progressive, late delayed damage to the brain after high-dose radiation is thought to be caused by radiation-induced long-lived free radicals, reactive oxygen species, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Experimental studies suggest that radiation-induced brain injury can be successfully mitigated and treated with several well established drugs in wide clinical use which exert their effects by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This review highlights preclinical and early clinical data that are translatable for future clinical trials. [References: 85]",Excluded
2074,"Exposure to long-term evolution radiofrequency electromagnetic fields decreases neuroblastoma cell proliferation via Akt/mTOR-mediated cellular senescence. The aim of this study was to examine the potential effects of long-term evolution (LTE) radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) on cell proliferation using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. The growth rate and proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells were significantly decreased upon exposure to 1760 MHz RF-EMF at 4 W/kg specific absorption rate (SAR) for 4 hr/day for 4 days. Cell cycle analysis indicated that the cell cycle was delayed in the G0/G1 phase after RF-EMF exposure. However, DNA damage or apoptosis was not involved in the reduced cellular proliferation following RF-EMF exposure because the expression levels of histone H2A.X at Ser139 (gammaH2AX) were not markedly altered and the apoptotic pathway was not activated. However, SH-SY5Y cells exposed to RF-EMF exhibited a significant elevation in Akt and mTOR phosphorylation levels. In addition, the total amount of p53 and phosphorylated-p53 was significantly increased. Data suggested that Akt/mTOR-mediated cellular senescence led to p53 activation via stimulation of the mTOR pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. The transcriptional activation of p53 led to a rise in expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27. Further, subsequent inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4 produced a fall in phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb at Ser807/811), which decreased cell proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to RF-EMF might induce Akt/mTOR-mediated cellular senescence, which may delay the cell cycle without triggering DNA damage in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.

Maximum dose to the hippocampi was limited to 16 Gy; to the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and eyeballs this was confined to less than 37.5 Gy; for the lenses to 8 Gy. Dosimetric parameters of the two different plans of 8 patients were compared with paired t-test.RESULTS: Mean inclined head angle was 11.09 +/- 0.73degree. The homogeneity (HI) and conformity (CI) indexes demonstrated improved results, with an average 8.4 +/- 10.0 % (p = 0.041) and 5.3 +/- 3.9 % (p = 0.005) reduction, respectively, in the inclined vs. non-inclined position. The inclined head position had lower hippocampi Dmin (10.45 +/- 0.36 Gy), Dmax (13.70 +/- 0.25 Gy), and Dmean (12.01 +/- 0.38 Gy) values vs. the non-inclined head position (Dmin = 12.07 +/- 1.07 Gy; Dmax = 15.70 +/- 1.25 Gy; Dmean = 13.91 +/- 1.01 Gy), with 12.8 +/- 8.9 % (p = 0.007), 12.2 +/- 6.8 % (p = 0.003), and 13.2 +/- 7.2 % (p = 0.002) reductions, respectively. Mean Dmax for the lenses was 6.34 +/- 0.72 Gy and 7.60 +/- 0.46 Gy, respectively, with a 16.3 +/- 10.8 % reduction in the inclined position (p = 0.004). Dmax for the optic nerve and Dmean for the eyeballs also decreased by 7.0 +/- 5.9 % (p = 0.015) and 8.4 +/- 7.2 % (p = 0.015), respectively.CONCLUSION: Inclining the head position to approximately 11degree during HS-WBRT using VMAT improved dose distribution in the planning target volume and allowed lower doses to the hippocampi and optic apparatus.",Excluded
2079,"Light-induced Notch activity controls neurogenic and gliogenic potential of neural progenitors. Oscillations in Notch signaling are essential for reserving neural progenitors for cellular diversity in developing brains. Thus, steady and prolonged overactivation of Notch signaling is not suitable for generating neurons. To acquire greater temporal control of Notch activity and mimic endogenous oscillating signals, here we adopted a light-inducible transgene system to induce active form of Notch NICD in neural progenitors. Alternating Notch activity saved more progenitors that are prone to produce neurons creating larger number of mixed clones with neurons and progenitors in vitro, compared to groups with no light or continuous light stimulus. Furthermore, more upper layer neurons and astrocytes arose upon intermittent Notch activity, indicating that dynamic Notch activity maintains neural progeny and fine-tune neuron-glia diversity.",Excluded

To evaluate the pain response, local tumor control and toxicity of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with helical tomotherapy (HT) in the patients with spine metastasis. From May 2009 to June 2010, 22 patients with 31 lesions were treated by SBRT. Dose scheme were 24 Gy in 3 fractions (87.1%), 30 Gy in 5 fractions (9.7%), and 16 Gy in a single fraction (3.2%). Pain was assessed using a numerical rating scale. Analgesic consumption was recalculated into the daily oral morphine-equivalent dose (OMED). The response criteria of International Bone Metastases Consensus Group (IBMCG) was used. The median follow-up duration was 10 months (range 3-23 months). After SBRT the mean pain score decreased significantly (4.32 before SBRT, 0.71 at 3 months). However, median OMED didn't decrease until 3 months after SBRT (Median OMED; 34.5 mg before SBRT, 45 mg at 3 months). Pain response rate and pain progression-free survival rate at 3 month was 96.8 and 93.5%, respectively. Local progression-free survival rate at 3 month was 93.5%. There was no severe acute toxicity.

2081,"The application of magnets directs the orientation of neurite outgrowth in cultured human neuronal cells. Electric and magnetic fields have been known to influence cellular behavior. In the present study, we hypothesized that the application of static magnetic fields to neurons will cause neurites to grow in a specific direction. In cultured human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells or PC12 cells, neurite outgrowth was induced by forskolin, retinoic acid, or nerve growth factor (NGF). We applied static magnetic fields to the neurons and analyzed the direction and morphology of newly formed neuronal processes. In the presence of the magnetic field, neurites grew in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field, as revealed by the higher orientation index of neurites grown under the magnetic field compared to that of the neurites grown in the absence of the magnetic field. The neurites parallel to the magnetic field appeared to be dystrophic, beaded or thickened, suggesting that they would hinder further elongation processes. The co-localized areas of microtubules and actin filaments were arranged into the vertical axis to the magnetic field, while the levels of neurofilament and synaptotagmin were not altered. Our results suggest that the application of magnetic field can be used to modulate the orientation and direction of neurite formation in cultured human neuronal cells.",Excluded

Cytokines and growth factors are important regulatory proteins controlling the growth and differentiation of normal and malignant glial cells. In this study, we investigated the expression and origin of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the subacute brain injury after a single high-dose irradiation using 60 Sprague-Dawley rats. The right cerebral hemispheres of rats were exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays using Ir-192. The radiation effect was assessed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks after irradiation, and the results were compared with those in sham operation group. Histological changes characteristic of radiation injury were correlated with the duration after the single dose irradiation. The loss of cortical thickness also increased with the lapse of time after irradiation. The TNF-alpha expression in the irradiated cerebral hemispheres was significantly increased compared with that in the sham operation group. TGF-beta 1 expression was also increased in the irradiated hemispheres. Immunohistochemical study revealed that TGF-beta 1 was expressed predominantly by infiltrating macrophages and astrocytes around the necrotic areas. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 may play prominent roles in the radiation injuries after a single high-dose irradiation.",Included

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of volume adapted re-planning for radiotherapy (RT) after gross total resection (GTR) for glioblastoma. Nineteen patients with glioblastoma who underwent GTR and postoperative RT were analyzed. The volumes of the surgical cavity on computed tomography (CT) obtained one day after GTR (CT0), the first RT simulation CT (sim-CT1), and the second simulation CT for the boost RT plan (sim-CT2) were compared. The boost RT plan was based on the surgical cavity observed on the sim-CT2 (boost RTP2) and was compared with that based on the surgical cavity observed on the sim-CT1 (boost RTP1). The volume reduction ratios were 14.4%-51.3% (median, 29.0%) between CT0 and sim-CT1 and -7.9%-71.9% (median, 34.9%) between sim-CT1 and sim-CT2 (P < 0.001). The normal brain volumes in boost RTP1 were significantly reduced in boost RTP2, especially at high dose levels. Target volume in sim-CT2 which was not covered with the boost RTP1, developed in five cases (26.3%). The surgical cavity volume was reduced following surgery in patients with glioblastoma who underwent GTR.

In the perfusion MRI, four regions of interest (ROIs) were identified and average values were calculated. A reference ROI of the same size was defined in the contralateral white matter to obtain the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). After coregistering the PET images with the MRI, we measured the maximum uptake values of the lesion and of the contralateral cerebral white matter as reference area to calculate the L(max)/R(max) ratio.RESULTS: The rCBV was higher in the recurrence group than in the necrosis group (p=0.010). There was no difference between groups in terms of the L(max)/R(max) ratio as derived from the (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET.CONCLUSION: A quantitative rCBV as calculated from a perfusion MRI scan might be superior to the L(max)/R(max) ratio as derived from (18)F-FDG and (11)C-MET PET in order to distinguish a recurrence of high-grade glioma from radiation necrosis.",Excluded
2086,"Targeted disruption of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene in miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a genetic disease caused by germline biallelic mutation in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) that results in partial or complete loss of ATM expression or activity. A diverse phenotype of the disease includes progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, radiation hypersensitivity, increased cancer incidence, immunodeficiency and chromosomal instability. The frequency of A-T in the United States and United Kingdom has been estimated to be 1:40 000. Heterozygous carriers may also have predisposition to diverse cancers. Although ATM-deficient mice have been produced, none reflects the extent of neurological abnormalities involving the loss of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum seen in patients. Hence, miniature pigs, which are anatomically and physiologically closer to humans, might serve as an alternative model for human A-T. In the present study, we attempted a targeted disruption of ATM in miniature pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Most A-T patients possess mutated ATM with truncation, resulting in prematurely terminated ATM proteins that are highly unstable. To induce the truncation of ATM, we disrupted exon 59 region of ATM that has been known to be critical for ATM kinase activity. Miniature pig fetal fibroblasts were transfected with ATM-targeting vector and treated by neomycin for 2 weeks. A total of 139 colonies were screened by PCR and 3 among them were identified as homologous recombinants with monoallelic disruption of ATM (targeting efficiency=2.1%). One of the 3 colonies was chosen and used for subsequent nuclear transfer. In total, 611 nuclear transfer embryos reconstructed with ATM-targeted fetal fibroblasts were transferred into 5 surrogate gilts. Two gilts became pregnant and developed to term with a total of 5 live piglets delivered. Being analysed by PCR, all piglets born were found to be ATM gene-targeted. Because conventional murine models of human A-T have provided only limited insights into therapies and pharmacological treatments, the generation of miniature pigs with disrupted ATM will allow new opportunities to more precisely understand A-T and to accelerate discovery of strategies for prevention and treatment of the disease. In addition, such animals may be utilised in studying cancer with respect to the involvement of ATM in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis.",Excluded
2087,"Effect of in utero radiation dose fractionation on rat postnatal development, behavior and brain structure: 3-Hour interval. We have previously shown that exposure of the rat fetus to ionizing radiation produces dose-dependent (0.25-1.25 Gy) changes in postnatal growth and behavior, and decreases in cerebral cortex thickness. Pregnant rats were exposed to single doses of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy, or to two doses of 0.5 Gy (separated by a 3 h interval) on gestational day 15. Pups were weighed and subjected to behavioral tests (righting reflex; reflex suspension; negative geotaxis; continuous corridor; and length, width, and sine of gait) over postnatal days 7-28. The rats were then sacrificed and brains removed for histology. The fractionated doses produced responses that were generally intermediate between those produced by the single doses and which, by interpolation, could be expressed as equivalent to a single dose between 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. Overall, exposure of the fetal rat to two doses of 0.5 Gy separated by 3 h produced effects equivalent to a single dose of 0.85 Gy. We conclude that fractionation of radiation dose results in less damage to the developing rat cerebral cortex, as measured by postnatal growth, behavioral tests, and morphological assessment.",Excluded
2088,"Temporal patterning of saccadic eye movement signals. Electrical microstimulation is used widely in experimental neurophysiology to examine causal links between specific brain areas and their behavioral functions and is used clinically to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders in patients. Typically, microstimulation is applied to local brain regions as a train of equally spaced current pulses. We were interested in the sensitivity of a neural circuit to a train of variably spaced pulses, as is observed in physiological spike trains. We compared the effect of fixed, decelerating, accelerating, and randomly varying microstimulation patterns on the likelihood and metrics of eye movements evoked from the frontal eye field of monkeys, while holding the mean interpulse interval constant. Our results demonstrate that the pattern of microstimulation pulses strongly influences the probability of evoking a saccade, as well as the metrics of the saccades themselves. Specifically, the pattern most closely resembling physiological spike trains (accelerating pattern) was most effective at evoking a saccade, three times more so than the least effective decelerating pattern. A saccade-triggered average of effective random trains confirmed the positive relationship between accelerating rate and efficacy. These results have important implications for the use of electrical microstimulation in both experimental and clinical settings and suggest a means to study the role of temporal pattern in the encoding of behavioral and cognitive functions.",Excluded

Although protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is important for hippocampus-dependent learning, its role in cerebellum-dependent learning remains unclear. We previously found that PTPMEG, a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs), bound to the carboxyl-terminus of the glutamate receptor delta2 via the postsynaptic density-95/discs-large/ZO-1 domain of PTPMEG. In the present study, we generated PTPMEG-knockout (KO) mice, and addressed whether PTPMEG is involved in cerebellar plasticity and cerebellum-dependent learning. The structure of the cerebellum in PTPMEG-KO mice appeared grossly normal. However, we found that PTPMEG-KO mice showed severe impairment in the accelerated rotarod test. These mice also exhibited impairment in rapid acquisition of the cerebellum-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning, in which conditioned stimulus (450-ms tone) and unconditioned stimulus (100-ms periorbital electrical shock) were co-terminated. Moreover, long-term depression at parallel fiber-PC synapses was significantly attenuated in these mice. Developmental elimination of surplus climbing fibers and the physiological properties of excitatory synaptic inputs to PCs appeared normal in PTPMEG-KO mice. These results suggest that tyrosine dephosphorylation events regulated by PTPMEG are important for both motor learning and cerebellar synaptic plasticity.",Excluded

AIM: Primary hypothyroidism is one of the late complications that can occur after radiation therapy for malignant tumors in the head and neck region. The aim of this retrospective study was to show the validity of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication model for thyroid gland based on clinical results.METHODS: Thyroid function was evaluated by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine serum levels before radiation therapy, 3 months after the beginning of radiation therapy, and afterwards at each follow-up visit. Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Dose-volume histogram, total dose, fractionation schedule, total duration of the treatment, and other parameters were used for normal tissue complication probability calculation based on the LKB model. The model was evaluated after fitting with the three sets of parameters for grade 2 hypothyroidism: 1) ""Emami,"" where n= 0.22; m= 0.26, and D<sub>50</sub>= 80Gy; 2) ""mean dose,"" where n= 1; m= 0.27, and D<sub>50</sub>= 60Gy; and 3) ""Lyman EUD,"" where n= 0.49; m= 0.24, and D<sub>50</sub>= 60Gy.

Result(s): A 57-year-old man presented with rapidly progressing swelling and redness in his right eye for 2 months. A salmon-colored mass was present under all parts of the bulbar conjunctiva. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass anterior to the globe without any sinus involvement. Positron emission tomographic study did not show other disease sites. Immunohistopathological studies on incisional biopsy specimen demonstrated ENKTCL with positive CD2, CD7, CD56, bcl-2, and T cell-restricted intracellular antigen, and negative CD20, CD8, CD123, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase staining.

2097,"Monte Carlo-based dose reconstruction in a rat model for scattered ionizing radiation investigations. PURPOSE: In radiation biology, rats are often irradiated, but the precise dose distributions are often lacking, particularly in areas that receive scatter radiation. We used a non-dedicated set of resources to calculate detailed dose distributions, including doses to peripheral organs well outside of the primary field, in common rat exposure settings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a detailed dose reconstruction in a rat through an analog to the conventional human treatment planning process. The process consisted of: (i) Characterizing source properties of an X-ray irradiator system, (ii) acquiring a computed tomography (CT) scan of a rat model, and (iii) using a Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine to generate the dose distribution within the rat model. We considered cranial and liver irradiation scenarios where the rest of the body was protected by a lead shield. Organs of interest were the brain, liver and gonads. The study also included paired scenarios where the dose to adjacent, shielded rats was determined as a potential control for analysis of bystander effects.RESULTS: We established the precise doses and dose distributions delivered to the peripheral organs in single and paired rats. Mean doses to non-targeted organs in irradiated rats ranged from 0.03-0.1% of the reference platform dose. Mean doses to the adjacent rat peripheral organs were consistent to within 10% those of the directly irradiated rat.CONCLUSIONS: This work provided details of dose distributions in rat models under common irradiation conditions and established an effective scenario for delivering only scattered radiation consistent with that in a directly irradiated rat.",Excluded
2098,"Surgeon education decreases radiation dose in complex endovascular procedures and improves patient safety. OBJECTIVE: Complex endovascular procedures such as fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) are associated with higher radiation doses compared with other fluoroscopically guided interventions (FGIs). The purpose of this study was to determine whether surgeon education on radiation dose control can lead to lower reference air kerma (RAK) and peak skin dose (PSD) levels in high-dose procedures.METHODS: Radiation dose and operating factors were recorded for FGI performed in a hybrid room over a 16-month period. Cases exceeding 6 Gy RAK were investigated according to institutional policy. Information obtained from these investigations led to surgeon education focused on reducing patient dose. Points addressed included increasing table height, utilizing collimation and angulation, decreasing magnification modes, and maintaining minimal patient-to-detector distance. Procedural RAK doses and operating factors were compared 8 months pre- (group A) and 8 months post- (group B) educational intervention using analysis of variance with Tukey pairwise comparisons and t-tests. PSD distributions were calculated using custom software employing input data from fluoroscopic machine logs.RESULTS: Of 447 procedures performed, 300 FGIs had sufficient data to be included in the analysis (54% lower extremity, 11% thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair, 10% cerebral, 8% FEVAR, 7% endovascular aneurysm repair, 5% visceral, and 5% embolization). Twenty-one cases were investigated for exceeding 6 Gy RAK. FEVAR comprised 70% of the investigated cases and had a significantly higher median RAK dose compared with all other FGIs (P < .0001). There was no difference in body mass index between groups A and B; however, increasing body mass index was an indicator for increased RAK. PSD calculations were performed for the 122 procedures that focused on the thorax and abdomen (group A, 80 patients; group B, 42 patients). Surgeon education most strongly affected table height, with an average table height elevation of 10 cm per case after education (P < .0001). The dose index (PSD/RAK ratio) was used to track changes in operating practices, and it decreased from 1.14 to 0.79 after education (P < .0001). These changes resulted in an estimated 16% reduction in PSD. There was a trend toward a decrease in patient to detector distance, and the use of collimation increased from 25% to 40% (P < .001) for all cases; however, these did not result in a decrease in PSD. The number of cases that exceeded 6 Gy RAK did not change after education; however, the proportion of non-FEVAR cases that exceeded 6 Gy decreased from 40% to 20%.CONCLUSIONS: Surgeon education on the appropriate use of technical factors during FGIs improved operating practice, reduced patient radiation dose, and decreased the number of non-FEVAR cases that exceeded 6 Gy. It is essential that vascular surgeons be educated in best operating practices to lower PSD; nonetheless, FEVAR remains a high-dose procedure.",Excluded

A 38-year-old woman with acute monoblastic leukemia developed severe continuous pain in the left arm while she was in hematologic remission following both systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy. A nerve conduction study (NCS) showed marked decrease of amplitude in the left ulnar nerve, consistent with infiltration of leukemic cells. The pain in the arm was reduced by irradiation to the left brachial plexus, but right facial nerve palsy occurred. No improvement was achieved by systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy plus irradiation to the whole brain and right parotid. After sometime, she complained of pains in the legs and right foot drop. NCS showed amplitude decrease in bilateral peroneal nerve. Throughout the course, bone marrow remained in complete remission, and no signs of meningeal leukemia were obtained. A treatment with high dose Ara-C appeared to be effective for the pain in the legs. The foot drop, however, persisted and peripheral neuropathy progressed even after high dose Ara-C therapy. Peripheral nerve involvement in acute leukemia appears to be rare, and even more so in case of hematologic remission. The blood-nerve barrier may allow some malignant cells to escape from cytotoxic agents.

2100,"5-Aminolevulinic acid strongly enhances delayed intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by ionizing irradiation: quantitative analyses and visualization of intracellular ROS production in glioma cells in vitro. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy has important roles in multimodal treatment for highly aggressive malignant gliomas. Previously, we demonstrated that multi-dose ionizing irradiation with repetitive administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) enhanced the host antitumor response and strongly inhibited tumor growth in experimental glioma. However, the mechanism of the radiosensitizing effect of 5-ALA is not known. Ionizing irradiation not only causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation initially by water radiolysis but also induces delayed production of mitochondrial ROS for mediating the long-lasting effects of ionizing irradiation on tumor cells. 5-ALA leads to high accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the mitochondria of tumor cells, yet can also improve dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in tumor cells. Here, we assessed the effect of 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis and delayed production of intracellular ROS after ionizing irradiation with 5-ALA in glioma cells in vitro. Temporal changes in intracellular 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis after ionizing irradiation in glioma cell lines were evaluated using flow cytometry (FCM). Then, the effect of 5-ALA on delayed production of intracellular ROS 12 h after ionizing irradiation in glioma cells was evaluated by FCM and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Ionizing irradiation had no effect on 5-ALA-induced PpIX synthesis in glioma cells. Delayed intracellular production of ROS was significantly higher than that just after ionizing irradiation, but 5-ALA pretreatment strongly enhanced the delayed intracellular production of ROS, mainly in the cytoplasm of glioma cells. This 5-ALA-induced increase in the delayed production of ROS tended to be higher in the case of 5-ALA treatment before rather than after ionizing irradiation. These results suggest that 5-ALA can affect tumor cells under ionizing irradiation, and greatly increase secondary intracellular production of ROS long after ionizing irradiation, thereby causing a radiosensitizing effect in glioma cells.",Excluded
2101,"Association of Radioactive Iodine Treatment with Cancer Mortality in Patients with Hyperthyroidism. Importance: Radioactive iodine (RAI) has been used extensively to treat hyperthyroidism since the 1940s. Although widely considered a safe and effective therapy, RAI has been associated with elevated risks of total and site-specific cancer death among patients with hyperthyroidism. Objective(s): To determine whether greater organ- or tissue-absorbed doses from RAI treatment are associated with overall and site-specific cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study is a 24-year extension of the multicenter Cooperative Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Follow-up Study, which has followed up US and UK patients diagnosed and treated for hyperthyroidism for nearly 7 decades, beginning in 1946. Patients were traced using records from the National Death Index, Social Security Administration, and other resources. After exclusions, 18805 patients who were treated with RAI and had no history of cancer at the time of the first treatment were eligible for the current analysis. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100-mGy dose to the organ or tissue were calculated using multivariable-adjusted linear dose-response models and were converted to relative risks (RR = 1 + ERR).

Mean organ or tissue dose estimates ranged from 20 to 99 mGy (colon or rectum, ovary, uterus, prostate, bladder, and brain/central nervous system), to 100 to 400 mGy (pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, female breast, lung, oral mucosa, and marrow), to 1.6 Gy (esophagus), and to 130 Gy (thyroid gland). Main Outcomes and Measures: Site-specific and all solid-cancer mortality. Result(s): A total of 18805 patients were included in the study cohort, and the mean (SD) entry age was 49 (14) years. Most patients were women (14671 [78.0%]), and most had a Graves disease diagnosis (17615 [93.7%]). Statistically significant positive associations were observed for all solid cancer mortality (n = 1984; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P =.002), including female breast cancer (n = 291; RR at 100-mGy dose to the breast = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.003-1.32; P =.04) and all other solid cancers combined (n = 1693; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P =.01). The 100-mGy dose to the stomach and breast corresponded to a mean (SD) administered activity of 243 (35) MBq and 266 (58) MBq in patients with Graves disease. For every 1000 patients with hyperthyroidism receiving typical doses to the stomach (150 to 250 mGy), an estimated lifetime excess of 19 (95% CI, 3-40) to 32 (95% CI, 5-66) solid cancer deaths could occur. Conclusions and Relevance: In RAI-treated patients with hyperthyroidism, greater organ-absorbed doses appeared to be modestly positively associated with risk of death from solid cancer, including breast cancer. Additional studies are needed of the risks and advantages of all major treatment options available to patients with hyperthyroidism. Copyright © 2019 American Medical Association.

The patient was a 76-year-old male, who underwent total gastrectomy for advanced gastric carcinoma with direct invasion of the pancreas. One year and six months later, he was resected for a right temporal-occipital brain metastatic tumor, and local cerebral irradiation at 30 Gy was performed. Four months later, new multiple brain metastases were detected in the cerebellum. We tried paclitaxel administration. It was continued on a weekly basis at 70 mg/m(2), and the brain metastases continued to diminish; in addition, gamma knife therapy led to an improvement in the quality of life. Although the patient had been told that he had only a month to live, he was improving dramatically. However, he died of sepsis due to Fournier's gangrene about 5 months later.

2104,"Radiation dose to the neurovascular bundles or penile bulb does not predict erectile dysfunction after prostate brachytherapy. PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between calculated doses to the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) and the penile bulb (PB) and the development of erectile dysfunction (ED) after low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (LDRPB) alone.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between September 1997 and June 1999, 84 men were treated with LDRPB alone. Inclusion criteria for this study were (1) no ED according to a self-administered questionnaire before PB, (2) treatment with PB alone (125I; 144 Gy), (3) postimplant CT scan of the prostate 1 month after PB, and (4) minimum of 24 months of continuous follow-up. Fifty men met all inclusion criteria. ED was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire completed before and at each follow-up visit after LDRPB. Radiation doses to the NVB and PB were calculated on the basis of axial postimplant CT images. Multiple variables (patient-related and dosimetric quantifiers) that may predict for the development of ED were examined by univariate analysis.RESULTS: Thirty of the 50 men (60%) were potent at last follow-up. The only patient-related variable that predicted for the development of ED was patient age (<65 vs. >65 years; p=0.03). The calculated mean maximum doses to the NVB and PB were 684 Gy (range, 195-1277 Gy) and 498 Gy (range, 44-971 Gy), respectively. The mean calculated doses to 50% of the NVB and PB were 158 Gy (range, 76-240 Gy) and 43 Gy (range, 19-101 Gy), respectively. The calculated mean maximum, mean minimum, and mean doses to 50% of the NVB or PB did not differ between those men who developed ED and those men who did not develop ED. None of the dosimetric variables examined predicted the development of ED after LDRPB.CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, higher calculated doses to the NVB or PB are not associated with ED after LDRPB.",Excluded
2105,"Radionuclide antibody-conjugates, a targeted therapy towards cancer. Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is an investigational procedure which utilises monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), peptide conjugates and/or other chemical compounds. These bio-vectors are able to transport a dose of alpha particles to destroy cancer cells. Radionuclide antibody-conjugates (RACs), labelled with beta emitters, have already been used in humans. More recently, TAT has been introduced to treat oncological diseases mainly leukaemia and lymphoma. Encouraging results have also been obtained in solid neoplasms with the administration of anti-tenascin. This chimeric antibody labelled with astatine-211 was delivered in patients with recurrent brain tumours into a surgically created cavity. Conversely, a clinical trial using a standard TAT approach to treat patients with metastatic melanoma, observed the shrinkage of the solid tumour mass. This response in melanoma may lead to an alternative mechanism for TAT, called tumour-antivascular- alpha-therapy (TAVAT), and forms the basis of a novel approach to the treatment of cancer disease states. In this paper, we will concentrate mainly on the application of TAT using antibodies. In particular, an investigation into the major general features connected with the use of alpha emitters in cancer therapy will be discussed. The prospective role of TAT with RACs will also be outlined briefly, especially focussing on the most important therapeutic strategies to date based on antibodies radiolabelled with beta emitters.",Excluded

2107,"Overuse of Head CT Examinations for the Investigation of Minor Head Trauma: Analysis of Contributing Factors. Purpose The aim of this study was to estimate the amount of CT studies performed in the emergency department of a tertiary hospital that are not indicated by Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHR) guidelines and to analyze factors that contribute to unnecessary examinations. Methods A total of 955 brain CT examinations performed for minor head injuries were randomly retrospectively selected. Medical records were assessed for the following parameters: demographics, cause of head trauma, and referring physician's seniority and specialty. For each CT scan, it was determined whether the CT referral met the CCHR criteria. The CT interpretations of patients under 65 years of age were evaluated to assess the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the CCHR criteria. Results A total of 104 examinations (10.9%) were not indicated according to the CCHR, but in patients younger than 65 years, 104 of 279 examinations (37.3%) were not indicated. Neurologists conducted more unwarranted CT studies (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; P = .011), whereas surgeons tended to order fewer studies (OR, 0.676; P = .126). There was no statistically significant difference between the seniority of the referring physician and over-referral (P = .181). Four-wheel motor vehicle accidents (OR, 2.789; P = .001) and a hit on the head by an object (OR, 2.843; P = .006) were associated with a higher rate of nonindicated CT examinations. The CCHR had sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% for either brain hemorrhage or fractures. Conclusions Overuse of CT examinations for minor head injuries was demonstrated, especially in young patients, with an excess of 37.3%. Contributing factors are referring physician specialty and injury mechanism. Analysis of overuse causes can be implemented for education programs and for computerized referring protocols.

2108,"Biomedical applications of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR spectroscopy is the most straightforward-to-use technique for studying free radicals and other paramagnetic species and has therefore established itself in biomedical research and for clinical applications. EPR found its applications in oximetry, where this technique allows repeated measurements of oxygen in tissues-also in vivo and in combination with imaging techniques. The direct detection of paramagnetic species like transition metal ions by EPR allows elucidation of their specific roles in disease, for example how copper ions might be involved in the formation of amyloid- or amyloid-like fibrils in neurodegenerative diseases. For investigations on the structures of this protein aggregates, but also of other proteins or protein complexes with medical relevance the technique of site-directed spin labeling (SDSL)-the site-specific introduction of paramagnetic reporter groups into proteins or nucleic acids-is nowadays frequently used, especially in cases where other structural techniques are not applicable. Moreover, by direct detection of free radicals-also in combination with spin trapping methods, or application of SDSL, EPR spectroscopy can be also used for diagnostic purposes, e.g. in cancer diagnostics. This review gives an up-to-date overview about how EPR spectroscopy is currently used in biomedical research and clinical applications, with special emphasis on biomedical applications of SDSL EPR.

2109,"Development and Validation of the BREAST-Q Breast-Conserving Therapy Module. Background: In breast cancer surgery, patient-reported outcome measures are needed to measure outcomes best reported by patients (e.g., psychosocial well-being). This study aimed to develop and validate a new BREAST-Q module to address the unique concerns of patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Method(s): Phase 1 involved qualitative and cognitive interviews with women who had BCT and clinical expert input to establish content for the BCT module. A field-test (phase 2) was performed, and Rasch measurement theory (RMT) analysis was used for item reduction and examination of reliability and validity. Validation of the item-reduced scales in a clinical sample (phase 3) was conducted for further assessment of their psychometric properties. Result(s): Qualitative interviews with 24 women resulted in the addition of 15 new items across multiple existing BREAST-Q scales and the development of two new scales (Adverse Effects of Radiation and Satisfaction With Information-Radiation Therapy). Feedback from 15 patients and 5 clinical experts were used to refine the instructions, response options, and item wording. An RMT analysis of data from 3497 women resulted in item reduction. The final set of scales showed evidence of ordered response option thresholds, good item fit, and good reliability, except for the Adverse Effects of the Radiation Scale. Validity and reliability were further supported by the phase 3 data from 3125 women. Conclusion(s): The BREAST-Q BCT module can be used in research and clinical care to evaluate quality metrics and to compare surgical outcomes across all breast cancer surgery patients.

2110,"Simultaneous chemoradiotherapy with irinotecan and cisplatin in limited disease small cell lung cancer: a phase I study. INTRODUCTION: Early radiotherapy concurrent with chemotherapy appears to have prognostic benefits in patients with limited disease SCLC. Irinotecan/cisplatin have been shown to be superior to a standard treatment with etoposide/cisplatin in extensive disease SCLC. The present phase I study aims to assess the feasibility of irinotecan/cisplatin administered concurrently with radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients were treated concurrently with conventional fractionated radiotherapy (1.8-45 Gy + 9 Gy (RP)) and two cycles of irinotecan (40/50/60 mg/m2, Day 1/8/15, 29/36/43) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2, Days 1-3, 29-31), and four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy (CT). In addition, patients in complete remission (CR) received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any case grade III/IV non-hematological toxicity (esophagitis grade IV), grade IV leukopenia or grades III/IV thrombopenia (CTC) during RCT.RESULTS: No DLT was observed; an irinotecan dose of 60 mg/m2 is recommended. 3/12 patients developed grade III leukopenia, one grade II pneumonitis. The predominant toxicity was esophagitis, grade II in 7/12 patients, grade III in 5/12. After RCT 7/12 patients were in CR, systemic progression was not observed during RCT.CONCLUSION: Concurrent RCT with irinotecan (60 mg/m2) and cisplatin followed by four cycles of CT can be safely administered.",Excluded

STUDY DESIGN: Description of a navigated, single-step, minimally invasive technique for the placement of pedicle screws.OBJECTIVE: To describe a new technique for minimally invasive placement of pedicle screws in the lumbar spine using O-arm and StealthStation navigation in combination.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive surgical techniques are described in the literature as safe and effective methods for pedicle screw instrumentation. These techniques increase radiation exposure and prompt multiple instrument passes through the pedicle.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 35 adult patients (187 screws) underwent lumbar surgery with pedicle screw placement using the 1- (8 patients/48 screws) or 2-step (27 patients/139 screws) technique. Complications associated with instrumentation were noted. Pedicle screw position was evaluated.RESULTS: Of 187 screws placed, 181 (96.8%) were found to be fully contained within the pedicle (grade 1) and 4 (2.1%) had a breach of <2 mm. In the 1-step technique, no screws were malpositioned. One screw at S1 with inadequate fixation was replaced with a screw 1 mm larger in diameter. In the 2-step technique, 2 screws (1.06% overall) were revised due to inferior breach of the pedicle. No neurological sequelae were noted. Also, 1 screw was deemed too long at S1 and was replaced with a shorter screw. None of the revised pedicle screws caused neuromonitoring changes and the breaches were found intraoperatively on 3D imaging.CONCLUSIONS: Using O-arm and StealthStation navigation with minimally invasive surgical technology for placement of posterior spinal instrumentation is safe, effective, and limits radiation exposure.",Excluded
2112,"The effects of sequential versus concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy on survival and toxicity in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytoma. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of sequential versus concurrent administration of cranial radiotherapy and cisplatin/carmustine (BCNU) chemotherapy on survival and toxicity in newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytomas.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1988 to 1996, 101 patients were treated on 2 therapeutic protocols for malignant glioma that used the identical chemotherapy regimen but differed in the timing of cranial radiotherapy. The eligibility criteria for the 2 protocols were identical. In the first protocol (1988-1991, 52 patients), cisplatin 120 mg/BCNU 120 mg i.v. over 72 h, was given for 3 monthly cycles prior to cranial radiotherapy. After a response rate of 42%, with a median survival of 13 months was achieved with this sequential regimen, a successor protocol (1992-1996, 49 patients) was developed in which cranial radiotherapy began concurrently with the start of the identical chemotherapy regimen. Chemotherapy was delayed but not discontinued if prolonged grade III/IV hematologic toxicity was experienced, but protocol therapy was discontinued if disease progression or thromboembolic events occurred. Survival outcome and hematologic toxicity were compared for the patients treated on these protocols.RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of sequentially-treated patients and 68% of concurrently-treated patients completed all planned therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival was similar to concurrent or sequential administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (median 12.8 months vs. 13.8 months, respectively). Hematologic toxicity was significantly less in sequentially- versus concurrently-treated patients, with median nadir per cycle (2.9 vs. 1.8 x 10(3)/mm3) (p < 0.001), and incidence of grade 3/4 leukopenia 40% versus 77% (p = 0.002). There was also an increase in platelet transfusion requirements in concurrently-treated patients, but no significant worsening of anemia. We postulate that the worsened leukopenia results from the effects of concurrent radiotherapy on circulating stem cells.CONCLUSION: Concurrent radiotherapy with this regimen of cisplatin and BCNU chemotherapy did not improve survival, but did increase hematologic toxicity. Therefore, we do not recommend further testing of the concurrent regimen, whereas the sequential regimen is currently under evaluation in a Phase III trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the Southwest Oncology Group. In addition, these studies demonstrate that relatively small radiotherapy fields can deliver a dose to circulating stem cells sufficient to worsen the hematologic toxicity of concurrent myelosuppressive chemotherapy, a phenomena which should be considered in the design of combined modality protocols for other body sites.",Excluded
2113,"Sensitization and habituation of AMH and C-fiber related percepts of repetitive radiant heat stimulation. OBJECTIVE: Pain perception involves neuronal plasticity at peripheral and central stages, resulting in sensitization or habituation, depending on intensity and temporal features of stimulation. Concurrent assessment of perceptual change over different time spans is therefore important for understanding the dynamics of pain processing.METHODS: A new psychophysical procedure was established to assess sensitization and habituation during repetitive radiant heat stimulation. Short-term perceptual change (<1 min) during trials with 10 stimuli applied at 3 frequencies (0.2-0.6-1.8 Hz) and 3 intensities was assessed for AMH-II or C-fiber related percepts. Perceptual changes were monitored for medium-term (1-15 min) and for long-term (15-90 min) time spans.RESULTS: Short-term sensitization occurred only at frequencies above 0.3 Hz and was affected by both stimulus frequency and intensity, but the AMH-fiber related sensitization depended on intensity only above 0.6 Hz. Multiple stimulation of the same skin area during medium-term time spans resulted in habituation. No long-term perceptual changes occurred.CONCLUSIONS: The procedure permits concurrent assessment of short-term sensitization and medium-term habituation, assumed to be related to spinal windup and cutaneous nociceptive fiber fatigue, respectively.SIGNIFICANCE: The method is suitable for quantitative sensory testing of dynamic pain processing over different time spans, relevant in clinical testing of pain and in drug assessment.",Excluded
2114,"Ultra light-sensitive and fast neuronal activation with the Ca2+-permeable channelrhodopsin CatCh. The light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) has rapidly become an important tool in neuroscience, and its use is being considered in therapeutic interventions. Although wild-type and known variant ChR2s are able to drive light-activated spike trains, their use in potential clinical applications is limited by either low light sensitivity or slow channel kinetics. We present a new variant, calcium translocating channelrhodopsin (CatCh), which mediates an accelerated response time and a voltage response that is ~70-fold more light sensitive than that of wild-type ChR2. CatCh's superior properties stem from its enhanced Ca2(+) permeability. An increase in [Ca2(+)](i) elevates the internal surface potential, facilitating activation of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and indirectly increasing light sensitivity. Repolarization following light-stimulation is markedly accelerated by Ca2(+)-dependent BK channel activation. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown principle: shifting permeability from monovalent to divalent cations to increase sensitivity without compromising fast kinetics of neuronal activation. This paves the way for clinical use of light-gated channels.",Excluded
2115,"Inhibition of rhodopsin kinase by recoverin. Further evidence for a negative feedback system in phototransduction. Recoverin is a 23-kDa Ca(2+)-binding protein found predominantly in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Recent electrophysiological and biochemical studies suggest that recoverin may regulate the photoresponse by inhibiting rhodopsin phosphorylation. We find in both cell homogenates and reconstituted systems that the inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation by recoverin occurs over a significantly higher free Ca2+ range than previously reported. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at 1.5-3 microM free Ca2+ and is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2. Measurements of transducin activation demonstrate that this inhibition prolongs the lifetime of catalytically active rhodopsin. Ca(2+)-recoverin directly inhibits rhodopsin kinase activity, and Ca(2+)-dependent binding of recoverin to rod outer segment membranes is not required for its action. Extrapolation of the in vitro data to in vivo conditions based on simple mass action calculations places the Ca(2+)-recoverin regulation within the physiological free Ca2+ range in intact rod outer segment. The data are consistent with a model in which the fall in free Ca2+ that accompanies rod excitation exerts negative feedback by relieving inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation.",Excluded

Method of local adjustment of the parameters of mathematical models (examples of application)]. To increase the accuracy of calculation of tolerance doses of the likelihood of radiation-induced complications in normal organs and tissues by using mathematical models, the author has developed a method for local mathematical model parameter adjustment (LMMPA) which included analysis of the structure of a mathematical model, systematization of clinical information and its goal-oriented use to determine the parameters of a model. The necessity of developing the LMMPA method stemmed from the complexity of the body exposed to radiation a system and from the quest for taking into account the impact of the system on the values of mathematical models. LMMPA may be regarded as the extension of determination of the parameters of mathematical models or as the interactive determination of their parameters that describing radiation exposures of complex biological systems.

Background: In the 2016 World Health Organizations Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, gliosarcoma (GSC) is considered a variant of IDH-wild type glioblastoma (GBM) characterized by a biphasic pattern with alternating areas exhibiting glial and mesenchymal differentiation. GSC can be primary or radiation-induced and is an intra-axial brain lesion which often abuts a dural surface. While some GSC have indistinguishable imaging characteristics from glioblastoma, aggressive lesions can erode through the dura and skull and involve the extra-cranial soft tissues. We present the largest known imaging series of GSC with immunohistochemical and histologic correlation, documenting them as IDH(-) and delineating their imaging spectrum. Method(s): Pathology proved GSC cases were collected from our quaternary care center spanning the last 16 years. IDH status was either documented or obtained by staining tissue blocks. When available, p53, PTEN, MIB-1, EGFR amplification status, and MGMT methylation status were recorded and imaging findings tabulated. Result(s): 25 cases were identified, 21 were De novo, and 4 were radiation-induced. All lesions contacted a dural or pial surface. All cases were negative for an IDH R132H mutation, including post-radiation GSC. 16/16 cases showed non-amplification of EGFR/CEP7. MGMT methylation was present in 2/17.

2120,"Electrophysiological characterization of interlaminar entorhinal connections: an essential link for re-entrance in the hippocampal-entorhinal system. The hippocampal formation communicates with the neocortex mainly through the adjacent entorhinal cortex. Neurons projecting to the hippocampal formation are found in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex and are largely segregated from the neurons receiving hippocampal output, which are located in deep entorhinal layers. We studied the communication between deep and superficial entorhinal layers in the anaesthetized rat using field potential recordings, current source density analysis and single unit measurements. We found that subiculum stimulation was able to excite entorhinal neurons in deep layers. This response was followed by current sinks in superficial layers. Both responses were subject to frequency dependent facilitation, but not depression. Selective blockade of deep layer responses also abolished subsequent superficial layer responses. This clearly demonstrates a functional deep-to-superficial layer communication in the entorhinal cortex, which can be triggered by hippocampal output. This pathway may provide a means by which processed hippocampal output is integrated or compared with new incoming information in superficial entorhinal layers, and it constitutes an important link in the process of re-entrance of activity in the hippocampal-entorhinal network, which may be important for consolidation of memories or retaining information for short periods.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Solar (brachioradial) pruritus is an enigmatic condition affecting the lateral aspects of the arm(s) and is primarily seen in Caucasian people living in the tropics or subtropics.METHODS: Over a 5-year period we prospectively evaluated 68 patients with solar pruritus seen in an outpatient dermatology clinic. Clinical, biochemical, and microscopic and ultramicroscopic studies were performed. An open-label trial of capsaicin cream application was initiated in 15 patients.RESULTS: An almost equal number of men and women were seen with an average age of 44 years. Brown-eyed and blue-eyed patients were seen with equal frequency. Most patients (86%) had outdoor occupations or avocations. The pruritus was intense, usually bilateral (72%) and invariably affected the lateral (as opposed to medial) aspects of the arm(s) in the absence of primary lesions. The most commonly affected area was the elbow area superficial to the brachioradialis and extensor carpi longus muscles, but extension of the pruritus to include the forearm and/or upper arm was common. Biopsy specimens (stained with hematoxylin and eosin) were normal or showed mild actinic elastosis in 15 patients tested. Ultramicroscopy showed myelin sheath splitting in all four patients studied. This is a nonspecific finding that may also be found in diabetic or alcoholic neuropathy. Ten of thirteen patients completing the capsaicin-cream study found significant relief (itching much improved or gone) after 3 weeks compared with the untreated control arm.CONCLUSIONS: The cause of solar pruritus remains unknown, but circumstantial evidence implicates chronic exposure to solar radiation. Capsaicin may offer relief to these patients, but the patients need to be cautioned about the burning sensation that occurs with capsaicin cream.",Excluded

The purpose of this prospective longitudinal study was to describe the occurrence, severity, and pattern of symptoms experienced by women during and after primary radiation therapy for breast cancer. A convenience sample of 30 women was recruited from a community hospital. The Symptom Profile by King et al (Oncology Nursing Forum. 1985;12(4):55-61) was adapted to measure 11 symptoms, and the Profile of Mood States assessed psychological status. Data were collected weekly during radiation and monthly for 3 months after treatment. There was a pattern of increasing incidence during treatment for the most commonly reported symptoms: fatigue (33%-93%), skin changes (36%-100%), sensation changes (28%-79%), and breast swelling (11%-38%), with gradual improvement over the following 3 months.

2127,Long-Term Evaluation of Combination Treatment of Single Agent HD-MTX Chemotherapy up to Three Cycles and Moderate Dose Whole Brain Irradiation for Primary CNS Lymphoma. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based chemotherapy in combination with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has been a common therapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival benefit of a minimized cycle of HD-MTX monotherapy prior to WBRT. A maximum of three cycles of HD-MTX was combined with a WBRT dose of 30 Gy and an additional localized boost was administered where remnant was observed. A total of 54 patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL were enrolled in this study. The objective response rate for HD-MTX was 80% and the median overall survival was 58.4 months. Responders to HD-MTX demonstrated better survival than patients with resistance. The concentration of MTX in serum and cerebrospinal fluid was not related the chemotherapeutic response. This study demonstrated the efficacy of HD-MTX prior to WBRT and indicated that three cycles of HD-MTX monotherapy may be sufficient in combination with radiotherapy.,Excluded

2130,"2MO Radiotherapy in cancer is associated with a deletion signature that contributes to poor patient outcomes. Background: Diffuse gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumors that invariably relapse despite treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy. Treatment with alkylating chemotherapy can drive tumors to develop a hypermutator phenotype. In contrast, the genomic effects of radiation therapy (RT) remain unknown. Method(s): We analyzed the mutational spectra following treatment with ionizing radiation in sequencing data from 190 paired primary-recurrent gliomas from the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) dataset and 2249 post-treatment metastatic tumors from the Hartwig Medical Foundation. Result(s): We identified a significant increase in the burden of small deletions following radiation therapy that was independent of other factors. These novel deletions demonstrated distinct characteristics when compared to pre-existing deletions present prior to RT-treatment and deletions in RT-untreated tumors. Radiation therapy-acquired deletions were characterized by a larger deletion size (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=1.2e-02 and P=8e-11, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test), an increased distance to repetitive DNA elements (P<2.2e-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and a reduction in microhomology at breakpoints (P=3.2e-02, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These observations suggested that canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) was the preferred pathway for DNA double strand break repair of RT-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, radiotherapy resulted in frequent chromosomal deletions and significantly increased frequencies of CDKN2A homozygous deletions. Finally, a high burden of RT-associated deletions was associated with worse clinical outcomes (GLASS and metastatic cohort, P=4.7e-02, HR=2.59 [95% CI: 1.01, 6.60] and P=2.5e-02, HR=1.43 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.94], respectively; multivariable Cox regression). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that effective repair of RT-induced DNA damage is detrimental to patient survival and that inhibiting c-NHEJ may be a viable strategy for improving the cancer-killing effect of radiotherapy. Taken together, the identified genomic scars as a result of radiation therapy reflect a more aggressive tumor with increased levels of resistance to follow up treatments.

2131,"Changes in intracortical circuits of the human motor cortex following theta burst stimulation of the lateral cerebellum. OBJECTIVE: The cerebellum takes part in several motor functions through its influence on the motor cortex (M1). Here, we applied the theta burst stimulation (TBS) protocol, a novel form of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) over the lateral cerebellum. The aim of this study was to test whether TBS of the lateral cerebellum could be able to modulate the excitability of the contralateral M1 in healthy subjects.METHODS: Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) amplitude, short intracortical inhibition (SICI), long intracortical inhibition (LICI) and short intracortical facilitation (SICF) were tested in the M1 before and after cerebellar continuous TBS (cTBS) or intermittent TBS (iTBS).RESULTS: We found that cTBS induced a reduction of SICI and an increase of LICI. On the other hand, cerebellar iTBS reduced LICI. MEPs amplitude also differently vary following cerebellar stimulation with cTBS or iTBS, resulting in a decrease by the former and an increase by the latter.CONCLUSIONS: Although the interpretation of these data remains highly speculative, these findings reveal that the cerebellar cortex undergoes bidirectional plastic changes that modulate different intracortical circuits within the contralateral primary motor cortex.SIGNIFICANCE: Long-lasting modifications of these pathways could be useful to treat various pathological conditions characterized by an altered cortical excitability.",Excluded

2133,"Phase I/II trial of simultaneous whole-brain irradiation and dose-escalating topotecan for brain metastases. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Topotecan penetrates the blood-brain barrier and sensitizes tumor cells against radiation. A phase I/II dose-escalating trial of repetitive daily i. v. topotecan application simultaneously with whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) was conducted to estimate toxicity, maximum tolerated dose and survival in patients with inoperable brain metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 47 patients suffering from previously untreated brain metastases, topotecan was applied on a daily i. v. schedule simultaneously with WBRT (36 Gy/3-Gy fractions). The infusion schedule started at the beginning of WBRT and was discontinued during weekends. Each infusion was completed within 1-2 h before irradiation. In a dose-finding study, topotecan was escalated from 5 x 0.5 mg/m(2), 8 x 0.5 mg/m(2), 12 x 0.5 mg/m(2) to 12 x 0.6 mg/m(2).RESULTS: Altogether, 38/47 patients (81%) completed the prescribed schedule. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were dose-limiting. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 5/32 chemonaive patients (16%) and 7/15 patients (47%) with previous chemotherapy. At 12 x 0.6 mg/m(2), 2/4 patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia/thrombopenia. Nonhematologic toxicities were generally mild to moderate and unrelated to topotecan. Response evaluation was possible in 26/47 patients, overall response rate was 58% (CR [complete remission] 5/26, PR [partial remission] 10/26, NC [no change] 8/26). Median survival amounted to 5.1 months. In 15/42 patients (36%), brain metastases were the dominant cause of death.CONCLUSION: For a daily topotecan schedule simultaneous to WBRT, the maximum tolerated dose is 12 x 0.5 mg/m(2) in chemonaive patients. For chemo-pretreated patients, daily doses should be reduced to 0.4 mg/m(2). A phase III trial has now been started to find out whether WBRT + topotecan increases survival compared to WBRT alone.",Excluded
2134,"Phase I study of weekly nedaplatin and concurrent pelvic radiotherapy as adjuvant therapy after radical surgery for cervical cancer. Nedaplatin is an analog of cisplatin that was developed in Japan, and it exhibits less nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity than cisplatin. This study aimed to determine the recommended dose of weekly nedaplatin chemoradiotherapy in high-risk patients following radical surgery. Fifteen patients who required postoperative pelvic radiotherapy after radical surgery for cervical cancer were enrolled in the present study. Nedaplatin was designed to be administered for eight cycles (minimum five cycles) beginning at a weekly dose of 22.5 mg/m(2) and then escalating to 25, 27.5, and then to 30 mg/m(2). Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy and/or planned chemotherapy (prior to the completion of five cycles) due to toxicity. Nedaplatin administration was interrupted prior to the completion of five cycles in one of six patients at a dose of 27.5 mg/m(2). A more than 7-day delay in the planned radiation therapy did not occur in any patient. Nedaplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) was safely administered, and two of three patients could receive the planned chemotherapy consisting of eight cycles of weekly nedaplatin. Our recommended weekly nedaplatin dose was determined to be 30 mg/m(2) administered for more than five cycles and up to eight cycles if possible. Weekly administration of nedaplatin may be more tolerable and less toxic than weekly administration of cisplatin.",Excluded

2136,"Spatial attention increases high-frequency gamma synchronisation in human medial visual cortex. Visual information processing involves the integration of stimulus and goal-driven information, requiring neuronal communication. Gamma synchronisation is linked to neuronal communication, and is known to be modulated in visual cortex both by stimulus properties and voluntarily-directed attention. Stimulus-driven modulations of gamma activity are particularly associated with early visual areas such as V1, whereas attentional effects are generally localised to higher visual areas such as V4. The absence of a gamma increase in early visual cortex is at odds with robust attentional enhancements found with other measures of neuronal activity in this area. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to explore the effect of spatial attention on gamma activity in human early visual cortex using a highly effective gamma-inducing stimulus and strong attentional manipulation. In separate blocks, subjects tracked either a parafoveal grating patch that induced gamma activity in contralateral medial visual cortex, or a small line at fixation, effectively attending away from the gamma-inducing grating. Both items were always present, but rotated unpredictably and independently of each other. The rotating grating induced gamma synchronisation in medial visual cortex at 30-70. Hz, and in lateral visual cortex at 60-90. Hz, regardless of whether it was attended. Directing spatial attention to the grating increased gamma synchronisation in medial visual cortex, but only at 60-90. Hz. These results suggest that the generally found increase in gamma activity by spatial attention can be localised to early visual cortex in humans, and that stimulus and goal-driven modulations may be mediated at different frequencies within the gamma range. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2137,"Three-dimensional maxillary and mandibular regional superimposition using cone beam computed tomography: a validation study. This study aimed to validate a novel method for fast regional superimposition of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans. The method can be used with smaller field of view scans, thereby allowing for a lower radiation dose. This retrospective study used two dry skulls and secondary data from 15 patients who had more than one scan taken using the same machine. Two observers tested two types of regional voxel-based superimposition: maxillary and mandibular. The registration took 10-15 s. Three-dimensional surface models of the maxillas and mandibles were generated via standardized threshold segmentation, and the accuracy and reproducibility of the superimpositions were assessed using the iterative closest point technique to measure the root mean square (RMS) distance between the images. Five areas were measured and a RMS <= 0.25 was considered successful. Descriptive statistics and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to compare the intra-observer measurement reproducibility. The ICC was >=0.980 for all of the variables and the highest RMS found was 0.241. The inter-observer reproducibility was assessed case by case and was perfect (RMS 0) for 68% (23 out of 34) of the superimpositions done and not clinically significant (RMS <= 0.25) for the other 32%. The method is fast, accurate, and reproducible and is an alternative to cranial base superimposition. Copyright © 2015 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded

2139,"Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) inhibitor synergistically prolongs animal survival with standard therapies in patient-derived IDH1 mutant glioma xenograft mouse models. Background: Mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) occurs in > 70% of WHO grades II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas and secondary glioblastoma (GBM). The mutant enzyme catalyze the reduction of a-ketoglutaric acid to D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid, leading to cancer initiation. In this study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of SYC-435 (1-hydroxypyridin-2-one), a newly developed mutant IDH1inhibitor, both in vitro and in vivo in IDH1 mutant gliomas as compared with IDH1 wild type GBMs. Method(s): An established neurosphere line (BT142) of anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA), and a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of recurrent AOA (ICV0914AOA), and 2 PDOX models of GBM (IC-4687GBM and IC-3752GBM) were included. IDH1 mutations (R132H and R132C) were analyzed by pyrosequencing. To determine the in vitro antitumor activities, tumor cells were exposed to SYC-435 (0.02 to 20 [iM) and examining for changes of cell proliferation every 3-4 days till day 13 by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. For in vivo effects, orthotopic xenograft mouse models of IC-BT142AOA and IC-V0914AOA were treated with vehicle (as control), SYC-435 (i.p., 15 mg/kg/day x 28 days), temozolomide (TMZ, oral, 50 mg/kg/day x 5 days) + fractionated radiation (XRT, 2 Gy/day x 5 days) (as standard therapy), and combination of SYC-435 with standard therapy starting 2 weeks after intracranial tumor implantation. Animal survival times were analyzed by log rank analysis. Result(s): IDH1 R132H mutation (homozygous) was detected in BT142AOA neurosphere line and R132C mutation (mutant allele frequency 39-42%) in IC-V0914AOA xenograft cells, while the two GBM models (IC-4687GBM and IC-3752GBM) carried wild-type IDH1. Suppression of cell growth was observed in time- and dosedependent manner by SYC-435, particularly at the IDH1 mutant models. At 0.5 ^M, SYC-435 inhibited cell growth by 90% in BT142 and 60% in IC-V0914AOA cells, whereas in IDH wild-type GBMs only by 17% in IC-4687GBM and 19% in IC-3752GBM cells at day 13, indicating the high selectivity of SYC-435 of mutant over wild type IDH1. Systematic in vivo treatment with SYC-435 alone did not alter survival times in neither IC-BT142AOA nor IC-V0914AOA models when compared with the control group. Although standard therapy significantly prolonged animal survival times in both models (P<0.0005), combining SYC-435 with standard therapies further extended the median survival times from 106 days (in the standard therapy group) to 124 days (P<0.05) in IC-V0914AOA and exhibited similar trend in IC-BT142AOA. Conclusion(s): SYC-435 possesses antitumor effects that are highly selective in IDH1 mutant gliomas, and generated strong synergistic activities with standard therapies in vivo. Our data support the clinical testing of SYC-435 in patients with IDH1 mutant glioma.",Excluded
2140,"Visually induced initiation of Drosophila innate courtship-like following pursuit is mediated by central excitatory state. The courtship ritual of male Drosophila represents an innate behaviour that is initiated by female-derived sensory stimuli. Here we report that moving light spots can induce courtship-like following pursuit in tethered wild-type male flies provided the fly is primed by optogenetic stimulation of specific dsx-expressing neuronal clusters in the lateral protocerebrum (LPR). Namely, stimulation of the pC1 neuronal cluster initiates unilateral wing extension and vibration of both sides, whereas stimulation of the pC2l cluster initiates only contralateral wing displays. In addition, stimulation of pC2l but not pC1 neurons induced abdominal bending and proboscis extension. Ca(2+) imaging of the pC1 cluster revealed periodic Ca(2+) rises, each corresponding to a turn of the male fly during courtship. In contrast, group-reared fru mutant males exhibit light spot-induced courtship pursuit without optogenetic priming. Ca(2+) imaging revealed enhanced responses of LPR neurons to visual stimuli in the mutants, suggesting a neural correlate of the light spot-induced courtship behaviour.",Excluded
2141,"Arousal and stability: the effects of five new sympathomimetic drugs suggest a new principle for the prevention of space motion sickness. Sympathomimetic agents are frequent components in antimotion-sickness drug combinations because of their usefulness in counteracting the sedation caused by stressful motion or resulting from the administration of other antimotion-sickness drugs. The noradrenergic neurochemistry of the brain's arousal-attentional systems prompted us to evaluate the efficacy of five new sympathomimetic drugs and to further define the role of arousal in susceptibility to motion. Subjects were orally administered methamphetamine (20 mg), phenmetrazine (25 mg), phentermine (37.5 mg), methylphenidate (20 mg), or pemoline (75 mg) 2 h prior to taking a Staircase Profile Test. All of the drugs increased resistance to stressful coriolis stimulation by 80-120%. Methylphenidate and pemoline showed fewer side effects. These findings, interpreted in conjunction with the documented inefficacy of most anticholinergic and antihistaminergic drugs tested to date, suggest that sympathomimetic drugs or a generalized state of arousal can inhibit the development of motion sickness.",Excluded

2143,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation of early visual cortex interferes with subjective visual awareness and objective forced-choice performance. In order to study whether there exist a period of activity in the human early visual cortex that contributes exclusively to visual awareness, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the early visual cortex and measured subjective visual awareness during visual forced-choice symbol or orientation discrimination tasks. TMS produced one dip in awareness 60-120 ms after stimulus onset, while forced-choice orientation discrimination was suppressed between 60 and 90 ms and symbol discrimination between 60 and 120 ms. Thus, a time window specific to visual awareness was found only in the orientation condition at 120 ms. The results imply that both conscious and unconscious perception depend on activity in early visual areas. On the basis of previous estimates of neural processing speed, we suggest that the late part of the activity period most likely involve local extrastriate-striate interactions which provide the contents for visual awareness but are not themselves sufficient for awareness to arise.",Excluded

Most vertebrate retinas contain two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, which show different photoresponses to mediate scotopic and photopic vision, respectively. These cells contain different types of visual pigments, rhodopsin and cone visual pigments, respectively, but little is known about the molecular properties of cone visual pigments under physiological conditions, making it difficult to link the molecular properties of rhodopsin and cone visual pigments with the differences in photoresponse between rods and cones. Here we prepared bovine and mouse rhodopsin (bvRh and mRh) and chicken and mouse green-sensitive cone visual pigments (cG and mG) embedded in nanodiscs and applied time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to compare their Gt activation efficiencies. Rhodopsin exhibited greater Gt activation efficiencies than cone visual pigments. Especially, the Gt activation efficiency of mRh was about 2.5-fold greater than that of mG at 37 degreeC, which is consistent with our previous electrophysiological data of knock-in mice. Although the active state (Meta-II) was in equilibrium with inactive states (Meta-I and Meta-III), quantitative determination of Meta-II in the equilibrium showed that the Gt activation efficiency per Meta-II of bvRh was also greater than those of cG and mG. These results indicated that efficient Gt activation by rhodopsin, resulting from an optimized active state of rhodopsin, is one of the causes of the high amplification efficiency of rods.",Excluded
2146,"Localization of glutathione and induction of glutathione synthesis-related proteins in mouse brain by low doses of gamma-rays. First, we determined the cerebral localization of reduced glutathione (GSH) in normal mice by means of autoradiography using 99mTc-meso-hexamethyl propylene oxime. A highly specific localization of GSH in the cerebellum and hippocampus was observed. Secondly, we measured the elevation of GSH level in the brain after low-dose gamma-irradiation. The cerebral GSH levels increased soon after irradiation with 50 cGy of gamma-rays, reaching a maximum at 3 h post-treatment, then remaining significantly higher than that of the non-irradiated control until 12 h and returning to the control level by 24 h. Thirdly, we examined the induction of the activities and the mRNAs of proteins involved in the synthesis and regeneration of GSH in the brain of mice subjected to low-dose gamma-ray irradiation. The level of mRNA for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase was significantly increased at 0.5 h, and remained high until 2 h post-irradiation (50 cGy). The level was transiently lowered to the non-irradiated control level at 3 h and slightly increased again after 6 h post-irradiation. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was significantly increased 3 h after irradiation, and remained high up to 24 h post-irradiation. As for glutathione reductase, the mRNA level was increased at 0.5 h, and peaked strongly at 2 h, while the enzyme activity was significantly increased at 6 h after irradiation, and continued to increase up to 24 h. The level of mRNA for thioredoxin, which contributes to GSH biosynthesis by supplying cysteine to the de novo pathway, peaked between 0.5 h and 2 h post-irradiation, and rapidly declined thereafter. The content of thioredoxin showed a transient decrease immediately after irradiation, but was then remarkably elevated, reaching a maximum at 3 h, and thereafter declining sharply. These results indicate that the increase in endogenous GSH in mouse brain soon after low-dose gamma-ray irradiation is a consequence of the induction of GSH synthesis-related proteins and occurs via both the de novo synthesis and the regeneration pathways.",Included

The tumorigenicity of some cells can be rapidly induced by gamma-radiation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tumorigenicity of individual clones of C6 rat glioblastoma cells and the effect of gamma-radiation on their growth in vivo was studied by intracranial implantation into Wistar rats.RESULTS: A clone was found, C6#11, that was conditionally tumorigenic. It either did not form a tumor, or grew into a small encapsulated tumor, and did not cause death or neurological deficits in the animals. Gamma-irradiation of the animals (head only) with implanted C6#11 induced a fully developed invasive tumor that killed them within 25 days. Three grays of radiation of C6#11 cells two hours prior to implantation induced their tumorigenicity as well. The in vitro characteristics of the C6#11 cells as compared to a highly tumorigenic clone did not correlate with their behavior in vivo.CONCLUSION: The C6#11 clone is the first model of an experimental tumor that acquires tumorigenicity in an immuno-competent host immediately after low dose irradiation of the cells.",Excluded

Operable patients had thoracotomy followed by IDG. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), 2.0 Gy x 15 fractions with a total dose of 30 Gy in 3 weeks, was given to the complete responders (CR) after completion of chemotherapy. In the concurrent (CON) trial, patients received DDP 60 mg/M<sup>2</sup> IV Day 1, and etoposide 120 mg/M<sup>2</sup> IV Days 1-3 for four cycles, every 3 weeks, and concurrent thoracic radiation therapy to 45 Gy with either 1.8 Gy daily, for 5 weeks or 1.5 Gy bid for 3 weeks. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was given to the complete responders, 2.5 Gy daily for 2 weeks (25 Gy) (approximately 3 months after the initiation of treatment). Result(s): The IDG group had 28 evaluable patients with median follow-up of 17.5 months. The CON group had 33 evaluable patients with median follow-up of 21 months. Overall survival rates for IDG patients were 79% at 1 year, 39% at 2 years, 30% at 3 years, and 27% at 4 years compared to 93%, 70%, 51%, and 46%, respectively, for the patients treated with CON (p = 0.01). Loco-regional recurrence (44%) and distant metastasis (48%) was more frequent as the first site of failure in the IDG group compared to the CON group (30% and 30%, respectively). Brain metastases constituted 30% of first metastases with IDG compared to none with CON. Esophagitis was significantly greater with CON. Hematologic and pulmonary toxicity were similar with IDG and CON. One death due to infection was seen in each treatment group.

2154,"Thoracic radiation-YES. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15%-20% of all lung cancers, and the overwhelming majority (>95%) are associated with tobacco exposure. The incidence of all types of lung cancer, including SCLC, has been declining in the United States with the onset of tobacco smoking cessation programs, although this trend took nearly 20 years to become evident among men. Overall survival (OS) rates for patients with lung cancer have also increased by about 5% since the advent of low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning to detect early lung cancer. The prognosis for patients with SCLC continues to be poor but has improved with the advent of smoking cessation campaigns, more effective chemotherapy agents and radiation planning and delivery techniques, and the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for those who experience a complete response to therapy. Consolidation with chest radiotherapy has improved OS among patients with extensive-stage SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. SCLC often presents as bulky symptomatic masses, and mediastinal involvement is common with or without pleural effusion and extrathoracic disease. Extrathoracic spread (i.e., extensive-stage disease) is also quite common, being present in 80%-85% of cases at diagnosis. Brain metastases are present in approximately 20% of patients at diagnosis; roughly half of these metastases are symptomatic and the other half are detected by imaging. Predictors of poor prognosis include poor performance status, older age, and being male. The pathologic subtypes of the disease (small cell carcinoma and combined small cell carcinoma) all carry a similarly poor prognosis. Current guidelines of the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend the use of positron emission tomography (PET), CT scanning, or fused PET/CT scanning of the chest, liver, adrenals, bone, and other areas of concern in the diagnosis and staging of SCLC (NCCN guideline-SCLC 2017). Thoracic radiotherapy has also become important for improving OS among patients with SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. In one prospectively randomized study of 498 patients with extensive-stage SCLC (WHO performance status score 0-2) who achieved complete response to chemotherapy, patients who received consolidation thoracic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) had significantly better 2-year OS rates than did those who did not receive thoracic radiotherapy (13% vs. 3%, P=0.004). Thoracic radiotherapy further improved thoracic-only failure rates (19.8% vs. 46% without, P=0.001) (Slotman B et al, Lancet Oncol 2015;385:36- 42). However, many patients with extensive-stage SCLC do not respond to the standard etoposide/cisplatin chemotherapy (Fig 1). Those patients may need to receive molecular-targeted therapies or immunotherapy with the consolidating thoracic radiotherapy. Several histologic and immunohistochemical markers have been evaluated for diagnosing or monitoring treatment response in SCLC, including transcription thyroid factor-1 (positive in >85% of SCLC cases); cytokeratin 7; deletions in chromosome 3; Leu-7; chromogranin A; synaptophysin; myc amplification; and p53 mutations (present in ~75% of cases). Deletions in tumor-suppressor genes are also relatively common and include fragile histidine triad (FHIT) (80%); RAS effector homologue (RASSF1) (>90%); TP53 (>75%); retinoblastoma- 1 (RB1) (>90%); and retinoic acid receptor-beta (72%). However, to date no biomarkers have been validated for use in diagnosing SCLC. Moreover, mutations that are often present in non-small cell lung cancer (such as epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]) are rare in SCLC. Several clinicopathologic features have been linked with worse prognosis, including poor performance status, significant weight loss, high lactate dehydrogenase levels, large numbers of metastatic sites, and the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes. Because SCLC has the among the highest rates of somatic driver mutations, and because more than 95% of patie ts with SCLC are former or current smokers, immunotherapy seems a reasonable approach, as high mutation burdens correlate with good response to chemoradiotherapy and sensitivity to immunomodulators (Peifer M et al., Nat Genet 2012;44(10):1104-10). At MD Anderson Cancer Center, an ongoing phase I/II study of patients with extensive-stage SCLC has been proposed to the NRG as a prospective randomized study (PI J Welsh) (Fig 2). Use of thoracic radiotherapy to consolidate a site at which SCLC is quite likely to recur is reasonable, given that recurrence considerably reduces quality of their life as well as OS. In summary, in most cases SCLC presents as extensive-stage disease, for which outcomes are very poor. Consolidation with thoracic radiotherapy for patients who achieve a complete response to chemotherapy can improve 2-year OS rates. However, less toxic and more effective systemic treatment is also required to derive the greatest benefit from consolidation thoracic radiotherapy.",Excluded
2155,"Does prophylactic cranial irradiation improve overall survival of elderly patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer?. Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has led to improved overall survival (OS) for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has responded completely to chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy. However, whether PCI is indicated for elderly patients remains unclear. Method(s): We reviewed 658 patients with limited-stage SCLC treated in 1986-2009 at a single institution with definitive concurrent chemoradiation to a total radiation dose of 45-70 Gy. Variables investigated for possible association with OS included patient sex, age, ethnicity, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, year of diagnosis and treatment period (1986-1999 vs. 2000-2009), tumor size, radiation dose, cycles of induction chemotherapy, use of intensity-modulated-radiation-therapy (IMRT), and fractionation. Groups were compared with chi-square tests for categorical variables or medians tests for continuous variables. Kaplan-Meier estimates were constructed for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local-recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Result(s): Among 658 patients, 507 patients were <70 years old (Group A) and 151 patients were >=70 years old (Group B). Median survival time was significantly longer in the younger group (25.6 months vs. 20.3 months, P=0.007), but no differences were found in DFS, LRFS, or DMFS time by age. Of the 151 patients aged >=70 years (54 of whom received PCI and 89 did not), those treated in 2000-2009 (vs. 1986-1999) had better brain MFS than those treated in 1986-1999 (P=0.048); those who received PCI had better brain MFS than those who did not (P=0.033). Multivariate analysis showed that among patients aged >=70, receiving PCI, not receiving induction chemotherapy, and local-regional control were associated with fewer brain metastases (for PCI, subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]=0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.95, P=0.037; for induction chemotherapy, SHR=0.43, 95% CI=0.19-0.96, P=0.039; and for local-regional failure, SHR=0.996, 95% CI=0.993- 0.998, P=0.001). Among patients >=70, receipt of PCI seemed to have been associated with better OS for those with small-volume disease (primary+nodal disease <5 cm, P=0.0545) but not for those with larger-volume disease (P=0.7387). Conclusion(s): Patients aged >=70 years with small-volume limited-stage SCLC seemed to show a benefit in OS from the use of PCI, but those with larger-volume disease did not. Improved brain MFS was associated with use of PCI, no induction chemotherapy, and locoregional control.",Excluded

2158,"Lipid alteration following proton beam irradiation in mouse brain of radiation necrosis model. INTRODUCTION: Brain radiation necrosis (RN) is irreversible severe adverse effect after radiation therapy for brain tumors over 60 Gy. Effective treatment for this irreversible event has not been established. The lying mechanism of RN is to be elucidated in order to establish a new therapy. We have established brain RN mouse model using proton beam at the Wakasa Wan Energy research Center. In this model, RN was induced 8 months after irradiation and the histology of the necrosis recapitulated the human RN patients [Kondo N.2015]. So far, some researchers investigated the mechanism of RN based on protein level. However, with the advanced mass spectrometry technology, lipid mediator response to ionizing radiation was reported [Laiakis EC, 2014]. Therefore, in this study, lipid alteration after proton beam irradiation was investigated in mouse brain RN model using high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizing imaging mass spectrometry (HR-MALDI-IMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Generation of mouse brain RN model: C57BL/6J mice were irradiated in the restricted area of right brain at 60 Gy using proton beam. Tissue preparation: After 4 months later mouse was sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with cold PBS. The brain was extracted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in-80degreeC. The brain was sliced to a thickness of 4 mum with a cryostat and placed onto an indium tin oxide coated glass slide and stored at-20 degreeC until matrix application and subsequent HR-MALDI-IMS analysis. Each slide was anchored in vacuum deposition equipment and coated with 9-aminoacridine hemihydrates (9-AA) matrix layer obtained by sublimation at 220degreeC. The sequential sections were mounted onto glass slides for hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) staining. HR-MALDI-IMS analysis: HR-MALDI-IMS analysis was performed on a high-resolution microscopic imaging mass spectrometer (iMScope; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectrometry data were acquired in negative and positive mode in the mass range of m/z 700-1000. Statistical Analysis: Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed by Imaging MS Solution (ver 1, 12, 26; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). RESULT(S): Compared to non-irradiated area, in the irradiated right hemisphere, i) elevation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (34:1, 36:4, 36:1, 38:6, 40:6) and ii) decline of phosphatidylinositol (PI) (36:4, 38:4) were detected. CONCLUSION(S): The data indicated the phospholipid alterations after irradiation in mouse brain RN model in the chronic phase before establishment of RN. Further analysis for component of these phospholipids may include the precursor of lipid mediator, arachidonic acid (AA) or other fatty acids. We will investigate time-dependent change of phospholipids using mouse brain RN model and HR-MALDI-IMS analysis then finally find the responsible lipid mediators which induce brain RN.",Included

Sib patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), XP90TO (42 years old, male) and XP92TO (40 years old, female, were assigned to group F by the complementation analysis in hybridized heterodikaryons. The XP90TO and XP92TO fibroblasts exhibited the typical XPF characteristics of a threefold higher sensitivity to the lethal effect of 254 nm UV and a reduced level of 12% unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) compared with normal cells. Clinically, both patients manifested moderate to severe acute sun sensitivity by age 8, pigmented freckles by age 10 and skin malignancies at higher ages (6 basaliomas at 42 years in XP90TO; 1 basalioma at 41 years in XP92TO). Despite the still currently sun-sensitive state, the patients showed normal minimal erythema dose (MED) at monochromatic wavelengths of 290, 300 and 305 nm but abnormally delayed peaking of erythema reaction at 48 h after exposure. After irradiation with more than 3 MED, XP92TO showed a long persistence of induced erythema for at least 7 days. A review of the 16 reported XPF patients indicated mild skin manifestations, no neurological abnormalities, and more delayed skin carcinogenesis at a lower frequency than that in XPA patients.

2160,"Stereotactic radiosurgery plus whole brain radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for patients with multiple brain metastases. PURPOSE: Multiple brain metastases are a common health problem, frequently diagnosed in patients with cancer. The prognosis, even after treatment with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), is poor with average expected survivals less than 6 months. Retrospective series of stereotactic radiosurgery have shown local control and survival benefits in case series of patients with solitary brain metastases. We hypothesized that radiosurgery plus WBRT would provide improved local brain tumor control over WBRT alone in patients with two to four brain metastases.METHODS: Patients with two to four brain metastases (all < or =25 mm diameter and known primary tumor type) were randomized to initial brain tumor management with WBRT alone (30 Gy in 12 fractions) or WBRT plus radiosurgery. Extent of extracranial cancer, tumor diameters on MRI scan, and functional status were recorded before and after initial care.RESULTS: The study was stopped at an interim evaluation at 60% accrual. Twenty-seven patients were randomized (14 to WBRT alone and 13 to WBRT plus radiosurgery). The groups were well matched to age, sex, tumor type, number of tumors, and extent of extracranial disease. The rate of local failure at 1 year was 100% after WBRT alone but only 8% in patients who had boost radiosurgery. The median time to local failure was 6 months after WBRT alone (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.5) in comparison to 36 months (95% CI, 15.6-57) after WBRT plus radiosurgery (p = 0.0005). The median time to any brain failure was improved in the radiosurgery group (p = 0.002). Tumor control did not depend on histology (p = 0.85), number of initial brain metastases (p = 0.25), or extent of extracranial disease (p = 0.26). Patients who received WBRT alone lived a median of 7.5 months, while those who received WBRT plus radiosurgery lived 11 months (p = 0.22). Survival did not depend on histology or number of tumors, but was related to extent of extracranial disease (p = 0.02). There was no neurologic or systemic morbidity related to stereotactic radiosurgery.CONCLUSIONS: Combined WBRT and radiosurgery for patients with two to four brain metastases significantly improves control of brain disease. WBRT alone does not provide lasting and effective care for most patients.",Excluded

2162,"Highly favourable outcomes with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) for metastatic rectal neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN). Purpose: Rectal neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN) is more common than other NEN origins, but is less commonly metastatic. However, when present, distant disease carries a particularly poor prognosis. Evidence guiding optimal treatment of such patients is lacking. We assessed PRRT outcomes in patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive metastatic rectal NEN from two referral centres. Method(s): Patients treated with PRRT were retrospectively reviewed. Morphologic (RECIST 1.1), SSTR imaging responses and toxicity were assessed 3 months post-PRRT. Kaplan-Meier estimate was used to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from start of PRRT. Result(s): Twenty-seven consecutive patients (M = 20, age 31-81 years) were reviewed. The majority (70%) had ENETs grade 2 disease (19 patients), three had Grade 3, one Grade 1, and four not documented. Overall, 63% (10/16 patients with available FDG PET/CT) had FDG avid disease. Twenty-six patients were treated for disease progression. Most had <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-octreotate with median cumulative activity of 30 GBq, median four cycles. 14 patients had radiosensitising chemotherapy (5FU or capecitabine). At 3 months post-PRRT, CT disease control rate (DCR) was 96%: partial response was observed in 70% (19/27) and stable disease in 26%. All but one had partial SSTR imaging response. The median PFS was 29 months. Ten patients died, with median overall survival 81 months with a median follow-up of 67 months. Seventeen patients had further treatments after initial PRRT (10 had further cycles of PRRT). Three patients had grade 3 lymphopenia, without significant renal toxicity, MDS or leukaemia. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate high efficacy and morphologic responses with minimal toxicity and very encouraging survival from PRRT in patients with metastatic rectal NEN despite the adverse prognostic features of this cohort. Further prospective PRRT trials are warranted in this subgroup. Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2163,"Secondary radiation damage as the main cause for unexpected volume effects: a histopathologic study of the parotid gland. PURPOSE: To elucidate with a histopathological study the mechanism of region-dependent volume effects in the partly irradiated parotid gland of the rat.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Wistar rats were locally X-irradiated with collimators with conformal radiation portals for 100% volume and 50% cranial/caudal partial volumes. Single doses up to 40 Gy were applied. Parotid saliva samples were collected, and the three lobes of the parotid gland were examined individually on the macro- and micromorphologic level up to 1 year after irradiation.RESULTS: Dose-dependent loss of gland weight was observed 1 year after total or partial X-irradiation. Weight loss of the glands correlated very well with loss of secretory function. Irradiating the cranial 50% volume (implicating a shielded lateral lobe) resulted in substantially more damage in terms of weight loss and loss of secretory function than 50% caudal irradiation (shielding the ventral and dorsal lobe). Histologic examinations of the glands 1 year after irradiation revealed that the shielded lateral lobe was severely affected, in contrast to the shielded ventral and dorsal lobes. Time studies showed that irradiation of the cranial 50% volume caused late development of secondary damage in the shielded lateral lobe, becoming manifest between 240 and 360 days after irradiation. The possible clinical significance of this finding is discussed.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the observed region-dependent volume effect for late function loss in the rat parotid gland after partial irradiation is mainly caused by secondary events in the shielded lateral lobe. The most probable first step (primary radiation event) in the development of this secondary damage is radiation exposure to the hilus region (located between the ventral and dorsal lobe). By injuring major excretory ducts and supply routes for blood and nerves in this area, the facility system necessary for proper functioning of the nonexposed lateral lobe is seriously affected. The unexpected volume effect in the rat might have consequences for treatment strategies in radiotherapy, implicating not only salivary glands but also other organs with a seemingly homogeneous distribution of radiosensitive elements, a situation wherein volume effects have not been anticipated up to now.",Included

Pathological examination revealed a partial response. After surgery, radiotherapy with a radiation dose of 50 Gy was applied to the chest wall and supraclavicular lymph node. Multiple pulmonary metastases and mediastinal lymph node metastases were diagnosed 23 months after initial treatment, and she was treated with S-1 administration. Two months after S-1 treatment, the PET-CT showed metastasis in the right atrium. Since there were no cardiac symptoms, S-1 treatment was continued without cardiovascular treatment. However, the mediastinal lymph node metastasis progressed; and therefore, S-1 administration was stopped and chemotherapy with eribulin was initiated. Brain metastasis was diagnosed at the same time and treated with a gamma knife. Although chemotherapy with eribulin was continued, the patient died 33 months after initial treatment owing to the brain metastasis.

2167,"Persistent calcium current in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons. The suprachiasmatic nuclei contain the primary circadian clock, and suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons exhibit a diurnal modulation of spontaneous firing rate. The present study examined the voltage-gated persistent Ca(2+) current, in acutely isolated rat suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons using a ramp-type voltage-clamp protocol. Slow triangular voltage-clamp commands from a holding potential of -85 mV to +5 mV elicited inward current (100-400 pA) that was completely blocked by Cd(2+). This current showed little or no hysteresis, and was identified as persistent Ca(2+) current. The threshold for persistent Ca(2+) current ranged between -60 and -45 mV, and it was maximal at about -8 mV. Nifedipine at 10-20 microM blocked 80-100%. To assess the role of persistent Ca(2+) current in the generation of spontaneous action potentials in both acutely isolated and intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons, the effect of Cd(2+) and nifedipine on firing rate was studied using on-cell recording. Application of Cd(2+) exerted a weak excitatory effect and nifedipine had no significant effect on the spontaneous firing rate of isolated suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. In all intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations (n=15), Cd(2+) slowly inhibited spontaneous firing; in high-frequency firing cells (four of 15), a transient increase of firing rate preceded inhibition. No significant effect of nifedipine on firing rate of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons was found. Therefore, persistent Ca(2+) current itself (as carrier of charge) does not appear to contribute significantly to spontaneous firing of suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons. A slowly developing inhibitory effect of Cd(2+) on spontaneous firing of intact suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons in slice preparations may be due to penetration of Cd(2+) through Ca(2+) channels, and its subsequent effect on intracellular mechanisms, while the transient increase of firing rate in high-frequency firing neurons is probably due to inhibition of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current.",Excluded

Late radiation damages arise more often in nonproliferating or slow proliferating tissues after local irradiation in large (intolerable) doses of ionizing radiation. Obviously the late radiation effects are induced by radiation damages to capillaries and disturbances of microcirculation in tissues. This is a basis for tissue hypoxia, ""oxidative stress"" and loss of parenchyma cells. The direct radiation effect on parenchyma cells has as a rule little importance for production of late radiation damages. Other type of late radiation damages can be discovered after sublethal irradiation of whole body. This is a cause of decrease of life span. In this case the important factors are also damages of vessels, disturbances in microcirculation and loss of parenchyma cells in ""target"" organs especially in neuroendocrine and immune systems. The new data on the possibility to decrease the late radiation damages after local or whole body irradiation using postradiation treatment with pulsed electric field (PEF) are considered.

OBJECTIVE: To test the acute effects of the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist guanfacine (GFC) on motor excitability in intact humans.METHODS: Eight healthy right-handed adults received a single oral dose of 2 mg of GFC. Motor cortex excitability was tested by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation of the hand area of the left motor cortex. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. In addition, spinal and neuromuscular excitability were tested. All measures were obtained immediately before GFC intake (baseline), and 2, 6, and 24 h later.RESULTS: GFC decreased the slope of the MEP intensity curve, increased paired-pulse short-interval intracortical inhibition, and decreased paired-pulse intracortical facilitation and I-wave facilitation. These effects were maximal at 2-6 h and returned to baseline at 24 h. Motor threshold, cortical silent period, and the measures of spinal (peripheral silent period, F waves) and neuromuscular excitability (maximum M wave) remained unaffected.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on the effects of an anti-noradrenergic drug on human motor cortex excitability.

Analysis of data generated by ANKETA and the tapes thus recorded have shown that during adaptation to weightlessness, 98% of cosmonauts have noted the occurrence of various illusions of orientation (coordinate and kinetic): illusions pertaining to their position or illusions of self- and surround-motion. The development of spatial orientation illusions during and after flight is not limited to certain individuals, but is a general response of the sensory system to microgravity. These responses differ to some extent among individuals in severity, nature, time and duration of occurrence, and the dynamics of the process. Perceptual disorders may occur even if the cosmonaut feels well and experiences no anomalous autonomic reactions. The nature of spatial illusions was determined by the role and relative contribution of various types of sensory input to spatial orientation. After completion of the initial stage of adaptation to weightlessness, the perceptual disorders disappear. However, spontaneous illusory reactions were often observed after 50 days of exposure to weightlessness. The adaptation process during long-term spaceflight had an undulating course, in which adaptation and de-adaptation alternated. A classification of weightlessness illusions is proposed.",Excluded
2176,"Phenomenology of spatial illusory reactions under conditions of weightlessness. Sensory interaction and sensory adaptation in short- and long-lasting space flights (SF) and the dynamics of stability of adaptive shifts were studied by the phenomenology of spontaneous and visually induced illusory reactions. It was shown that perceptive impairment developed during the initial adaptation to microgravity should be considered regular reactions of sensory systems under given environmental conditions rather than special features of the individuals examined. The classification of spontaneous illusory reactions (SIR) under conditions of microgravity and the results of investigation of the vertical vection (vection is a visual illusion evoked by the optokinetic stimulation) are presented. The following previously unknown phenomena were registered for the first time: inversion of the vertical vection illusion (VVI) evoked by vertical and sinusoidal optokinetic stimulation, impairment of perception of the body schema during VVI, change in the character of VVI, and development of VVI asymmetry. During long-lasting existence under conditions of weightlessness the anomalous perceptive reactions continued to be registered episodically (the period of adaptation was replaced by that of deadaptation). A hypothesis was suggested for the possible mechanisms of the phenomena found. [Translated from Fiziologiya Cheloveka, vol. 21, no. 4, p. 50-62, July-August, 1995]",Excluded

We describe biological evaluation of a novel theranostic agent targeted to microtubules. Methyl N-[5-(3'-[<sup>131</sup>I]iodobenzoyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]carbamate (1) and methyl N-[5-(3'-[<sup>125</sup>I]iodobenzoyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]carbamate (2) were synthesized from a common precursor 3'-stannylated derivative (4). Antiproliferative effects and radiotoxicity of <sup>131</sup>I-labeled beta-particle emitting 1 were examined in vitro in human neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cells lines. The therapeutic potential of 1 was also examined in a subcutaneous mouse model of human glioblastoma U-87 MG. Compound 1 at the extracellular radioactive concentration of 0.35 MBq/mL, easily achievable in vivo, kills >90% of neuroblastoma cells and >60% glioblastoma cells as measured in a clonogenic assay. D<inf>10</inf> doses established for 1 indicate that as few as 3,000 decays are sufficient to kill 90% of BE(2)-C cells.

2182,"Prospective Peer Review for Patients Undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Intracranial Radiosurgery in a Multi-Site Community-Setting is Both Feasible and Effective. Purpose/Objective(s): Delivery of stereotactic radiation requires a level of quality assurance beyond traditional fractionation given the impact of misdelivery. While efforts to improve peer review at academic centers have been reported, very few guidelines exist in the literature for implementation of a program with more intensive review of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or intracranial radiosurgery (SRS) in a community-based setting. Here, we report on the logistics as well as the first 260 cases reviewed in one year of a pilot program at a community-based multi-location network of radiation oncology facilities. Materials/Methods: We implemented a departmental process at four network radiation facilities affiliated with an academic institution that no SBRT or SRS case could be treated without a second physician approving the contours and plan prior to delivery of the first fraction. Coincident with this process, we began an SBRT/SRS peer review rounds for 30-60 minutes per week. Ideally, cases were reviewed initially for contour approval including targets, organs at risk (OAR), image registration, and overall directive/modality selection. Cases approved in this phase progressed to planning and were reviewed the following week for final peer approval. Cases with more urgent turnaround times, particularly intracranial radiosurgery, were often required to be reviewed outside of rounds by a second physician. Recommendations for changes in both the contouring/directive review phase and the planning phase were collected prospectively. Changes were designated major changes retrospectively by the physician team if the change materially altered the final plan. Result(s): From March 2019 to February 2020, 260 cases were treated with SBRT or SRS in our network. 56 cases (21.5%) had a change recommendation. 19 (7%) cases had a major revision. 95% (53 cases) of changes detected by this program were during the contouring/intent phase of planning with only 5% (3 cases) requiring revision at the planning phase or at treatment delivery. Most common deviations detected tracked closely with cases reported in the ASTRO RO-ILS system such as OAR (35%) and target revisions (18%), minor prescription adjustments (25%) and prior radiation dose not accounted for (9%). Near universal prospective peer review of stereotactic cases (99.5%) was accomplished using this system. Conclusion(s): Here, we demonstrate that prospective peer review is both feasible and results in a significant number of changes - 21.5% of cases reviewed. Major changes that materially altered the plan occurred in 19 of 260 cases (7%). This system allowed for near universal prospective peer review of these cases with no significant delay in planning or treatment with a low burden on physicians and staff of approximately 1 hour per week per physician.

The effects of hematoporphyrin derivative, light, and cobalt 60 (60Co) irradiation were studied in a rat glioma model using an in vivo and an in vitro clonogenic assay. There was no effect on tumor growth by visible light or by a single dose of 60Co irradiation at 4 Gy or 8 Gy, whereas 16 Gy inhibited tumor growth to 40% versus the control. Hematoporphyrin derivative alone slightly stimulated growth (P less than 0.1). Light in the presence of 10 mg hematoporphyrin derivative/kg inhibited tumor growth to 32%. 60Co irradiation in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a significant tumor growth inhibition (P less than 0.02). This growth inhibition was directly related to the concentration of hematoporphyrin derivative. The addition of 60Co to light in the presence of hematoporphyrin derivative produced a greater growth inhibition than light or 60Co irradiation alone. This effect was most pronounced when light was applied 30 minutes before 60Co irradiation.

Developmental hearing impairments compromise sound discrimination, speech acquisition, and cognitive function; however, the adjustments of functional properties in the primary auditory cortex (A1) remain unknown. We induced sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in developing gerbils and then reared the animals for several days. The intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were subsequently examined in a thalamocortical brain slice preparation with whole-cell recordings and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. SNHL neurons displayed a depolarized resting membrane potential, an increased input resistance, and a higher incidence of sustained firing. They also exhibited significantly larger thalamocortically and intracortically evoked excitatory synaptic responses, including a greater susceptibility to the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 and the NR2B subunit antagonist ifenprodil. This correlated with an increase in NR2B labeling of asymmetric synapses, as visualized ultrastructurally. Furthermore, decreased frequency and increased amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in SNHL neurons suggest that a decline in presynaptic release properties is compensated by an increased excitatory response. To verify that the increased thalamocortical excitation was elicited by putative monosynaptic connections, minimum amplitude ventral medial geniculate nucleus-evoked EPSCs were recorded. These minimum-evoked responses were of larger amplitude, and the NMDAergic currents were also larger and longer in SNHL neurons. These findings were supported by significantly longer AP-5-sensitive durations and larger amplitudes of mEPSCs. Last, the amplitudes of intracortically evoked monosynaptic and polysynaptic GABAergic inhibitory synaptic responses were significantly smaller in SNHL neurons. These alterations in cellular properties after deafness reflect an attempt by A1 to sustain an operative level of cortical excitability that may involve homeostatic mechanisms.",Excluded

2190,"Calvarial and skull base metastases: expanding the clinical utility of Gamma Knife surgery. OBJECT: Traditionally, the treatment of choice for patients with metastases to the calvaria or skull base has been conventional radiation therapy. Because patients with systemic malignancies are also at risk for intracranial metastases, the utility of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for these patients has been explored to reduce excess radiation exposure to the perilesional brain parenchyma. The purpose of this study was to report the efficacy of GKS for the treatment of calvarial metastases and skull base lesions.METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of 21 patients with at least 1 calvarial or skull base metastatic lesion treated with GKS during 2001-2013. For 7 calvarial lesions, a novel technique, in which a bolus was placed over the treatment site, was used. For determination of local control or disease progression, radiation therapy data were examined and posttreatment MR images and oncology records were reviewed. Survival times from the date of procedure were estimated by using Kaplan-Meier analyses.RESULTS: The median patient age at treatment was 57 years (range 29-84 years). A total of 19 (90%) patients received treatment for single lesions, 1 patient received treatment for 3 lesions, and 1 patient received treatment for 4 lesions. The most common primary tumor was breast cancer (24% of patients). Per lesion, the median clinical and radiographic follow-up times were 10.3 months (range 0-71.9 months) and 7.1 months (range 0-61.3 months), respectively. Of the 26 lesions analyzed, 14 (54%) were located in calvarial bones and 12 (46%) were located in the skull base. The median lesion volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 0.3-55.6 cm(3)), and the median prescription margin dose was 15 Gy (range 13-24 Gy). The median overall survival time for all patients was 35.9 months, and the 1-year local control rate was 88.9% (95% CI 74.4%-100%). Local control rates did not differ between lesions treated with the bolus technique and those treated with traditional methods or between calvarial lesions and skull base lesions (p > 0.05). Of the 3 patients for whom local treatment failed, 1 patient received no further treatment and 2 patients responded to salvage chemotherapy. Subsequent brain parenchymal metastases developed in 2 patients, who then underwent GKS.CONCLUSIONS: GKS is an effective treatment modality for patients with metastases to the calvarial bones or skull base. For patients with superficial calvarial lesions, a novel approach with bolus application resulted in excellent rates of local control. GKS provides an effective therapeutic alternative to conventional radiation therapy and should be considered for patients at risk for calvarial metastases and brain parenchymal metastases.",Excluded

The work was aimed at analysis and generalization of the hemodynamic data collected over 20 years from 26 cosmonauts flown 8 to 438 days aboard orbital stations Salyut 7 and Mir. The paper presents the results of ultrasonic investigations of the heart, arterial and venous peripheral vessels in different parts of human body, and measurements of leg veins capacity with the use of occlusive plethysmograpy. It was shown that in the resting condition such prime hemodynamic parameters as the pumping function of the heart and blood supply of the brain, and integral parameters, i.e. arterial pressure and heat rate, were best ""protected"" as they demonstrated stability throughout long exposure in microgravity. In the absence of gravitational stimulation, arterial resistance went down in essentially all vascular regions below the heart level; to put it differently, the anti-gravity distribution of the vascular tone was annulled gradually as unneeded in microgravity. Compared with the data about arteries, venous hemodynamics was found to be particularly sensitive considering the early advent and significance of changes. Venous return slowed down, resistance of the lower body vessels declined and capacity of the leg venous net increased. Functional testing with the lower body negative pressure revealed degradation of the gravity-dependent reactions that became more conspicuous as flight duration extended further. Cardiovascular deconditioning showed itself clearly on return to Earth's gravity by decreased g-tolerance during re-entry and orthostatic instability post flight.

We studied HCN1-4 channel mRNA and protein expression and correlated these findings with I(h) functional properties in rat DRG neurons of different size. Quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) analysis demonstrated that HCN2 and HCN1 mRNAs were more abundantly expressed in large diameter (55-80 microm) neurons, while HCN3 mRNA was preferentially expressed in small diameter (20-30 microm) neurons. HCN4 mRNA expression was very low in neurons of all sizes. At the protein level, subunit-selective polyclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence indicated that HCN1 and HCN3 are present in large diameter neurons and small diameter neurons. Staining in small diameter neurons was in IB4-positive (non-peptidergic) and IB4-negative (peptidergic) cells. HCN2 immunofluorescent staining was heterogeneous and predominantly in large diameter neurons and in small diameter IB4-negative neurons. HCN4 was poorly expressed in all neurons. Functionally, I(h) amplitude and density were significantly larger, and activation kinetics faster, in large diameter neurons when compared with small neurons. I(h) activation rates in small and large diameter DRG neurons were consistent with the relative abundance of HCN subunits in the respective cell type, considering the reported HCN channel activation rates in heterologous systems (HCN1>HCN2 approximately HCN3>HCN4), suggesting exclusivity of roles of different HCN subunits contributing to the excitability of DRG neurons of different size.

Similarities between photoreceptor Kx channels and EAG and KCNQ channels suggest that the Kx channel may be related to one or both of these families of potassium channels. To provide a basis for further comparison of these channels, as well as to reveal the role of zinc (endogenously present in photoreceptors) in Kx channel modulation, we studied the effects of divalent cations on activation and kinetic properties of the noninactivating potassium current, I(Kx), in salamander rod photoreceptors. We found that divalent cations slowed the activation of I(Kx) and shifted its activation curve to positive potentials, effects attributable to surface charge screening. The effect of zinc on I(Kx) kinetics was considerably stronger than that expected from the activation curve shift alone. None of the divalent ions studied changed the monoexponential nature of I(Kx) activation. A simple model of a rod photoreceptor was created using NEURON software. In the model, zinc accelerated and sharpened the light response, broadening the frequency response of rod photoreceptors. Our results show that although the overall effects of divalent cations are in part due to surface charge screening effects, zinc also induced a specific change in I(Kx) activation kinetics, and this action profoundly alters rod response properties.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: 33 patients with brain metastases were included in the study and treated with TMZ 60 mg/m2/day (days 1-16) concomitantly with WBI (36 Gy/12 fractions given in 16 days). One month after the end of radiotherapy, 6 cycles of TMZ were administered as adjuvant treatment (200 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days). Result(s): Responses were assessed using computed tomography at the end of the 3rd and 6th cycle of chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 54.5% and 57.6% after the 3rd and the 6th cycle, respectively. The median overall survival was 12 months. In patients with metastases from lung cancer the objective response rate was 11/14 (78.6%) after both the 3rd and the 6th cycle of treatment. The most common side effects were anemia (24.2%), thrombocytopenia (18.2%), as well as nausea and vomiting (18.2%).

HYPOTHESIS: Percutaneous pedicle screw fixations (PPSF) are increasingly used in spine surgery, minimizing morbidity through less muscle breakdown but at the cost of intraoperative fluoroscopic guidance that generates high radiation exposure. Few studies have been conducted to measure them accurately.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The objective of our study is to quantify, during a PPSF carried out in different experimented centers respecting current radiation protection recommendations, this irradiation at the level of the surgeon and the patient. We have prospectively included 100 FPVP procedures for which we have collected radiation doses from the main operator. For each procedure, the doses of whole-body radiation, lens and extremities were measured.RESULTS: Our results show a mean whole body, extremity and lens exposure dose per procedure reaching 1.7+/-2.8muSv, 204.7+/-260.9muSv and 30.5+/-25.9muSv, respectively. According to these values, the exposure of the surgeon's extremities and lens will exceed the annual limit allowed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) after 2440 and 4840 procedures respectively.CONCLUSION: Recent European guidelines will reduce the maximum annual exposure dose from 150 to 20mSv. The number of surgical procedures to not reach the eye threshold, according to our results, should not exceed 645 procedures per year. Pending the democratization of neuronavigation systems, the use of conventional fluoroscopy exposes the eyes in the first place.

Reactive oxygen species produce a wide spectrum of DNA damage, including oxidative base damage and abasic (AP) sites. Many procedures are available for the quantification and detection of base damage and AP sites. However, either these procedures are laborious or the starting materials are difficult to obtain. A biotinylated aldehyde-specific reagent, ARP, has been shown to react specifically with the aldehyde group present in AP sites, resulting in biotin-tagged AP sites in DNA. The biotin-tagged AP sites can then be determined colorimetrically with an ELISA-like assay, using avidin/biotin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase as the indicator enzyme. The ARP assay is thus a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the detection of AP sites in DNA. Furthermore, removal of damaged base by DNA N-glycosylases generates AP sites that can be measured by the ARP reagent. By coupling the ARP assay with either endonuclease III from Escherichia coli or 8-oxoguanine N-glycosylase (OGG1) from yeast, investigators can rapidly determine the amount of oxidative pyrimidine damage (endonuclease III-sensitive sites) or purine damage (OGG1-sensitive sites) in cellular DNA, respectively. An increased levei of oxidative damage has been implicated in several age-related human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease, as well as the aging process. The sensitivity and simplicity of the ARP assay thus make it a valuable method for investigators who are interested in estimating the level of oxidative DNA damage in cells and tissues derived from patients with various age-related diseases or cancers. © 2000 Academic Press.",Excluded

Five rabbits were used as a control group, five as SHAM, and twelve as a study group. The animals' HRs were recorded via monitoring devices on the first day, and those results were accepted as baseline values. The HRs were remeasured after injecting 0.5 cc of isotonic saline for SHAM and 0.5 cc of autolog arterial blood into the thoracic spinal subarachnoid space at T4-T5 for the study group. After a three-week follow-up with continuous monitoring of their HRs, the rabbit's thoracic spinal cords and stellate ganglia were extracted. The specimens were evaluated by histopathological methods. The densities of degenerated neurons in the TSN and stellate ganglia were compared with the HRs.RESULTS: The mean HRs and mean degenerated neuron density of the TSN and stellate ganglia in control group were 251+/-18/min, 5+/-2/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 3+/-1/mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively.

2202,"Invasive tracheal metastasis: Fatal complication of stereotactic body radiation therapy. Introduction: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an important and increasing public health threat in the developed world. In the US 17 % of patients diagnosed with de novo RCC present with metastatic disease most often to lung (50-60%), bone (30-40%), liver (20%) and brain (5-11%). No treatment is effective for majority of patients with systemic disease; median survival time of those with metastatic disease is 6-12 months with a 2-year survival rate of 10-20%<sup>1</sup>. Stereotactic body high-dose fraction radiation therapy (SBRT) has shown a high local control rate however it is not without complications. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66 year old male with medical history of RCC clear cell type s/p left nephrectomy in 2007 with metastasis to bone presented to clinic with persistent cough and submassive hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy revealed tracheal mass nearly obstructing the tracheal lumen 1 cm proximal to main carina. Endobronchial biopsy, cytology brush, and bronchoalveolar lavage were all negative for malignant cells. PET/CT showed avidity with SUV 5.0 in distal trachea. Multidisciplinary discussion occurred and decision was made to proceed with SBRT for presumptive metastatic renal cell carcinoma with tracheal invasion. Patient completed 5000 cGy radiation in 5 equal fractions with improvement in symptoms. Repeat bronchoscopy 4 months after SBRT therapy revealed necrotic tracheal tissue with concern of mediastinitis. Hospitalization 5 months after SBRT was due to recurrence of submassive hemoptysis. Repeat CT chest revealed acute mediastinitis with aortic ulceration of ascending aorta. Patient also reported expectorating pieces of thick tissue found to be remnants of tracheal cartilage. Rapid decline in hemodynamic status ensued and patient subsequently exsanguinated from ultimate aortic perforation. DISCUSSION: Without definitive therapy this patient would almost certainly have died of metastatic carcinoma to trachea. The patient could also die from aggressive treatment in context of treatment-related complications affecting lung parenchyma and adjacent vasculature. Conclusion(s): SBRT continuously evolves and is at the precipice of the technological advancements in image guidance, dosimetric parameters, and radiation delivery to direct radiation ablation doses to tumors. Careful evaluation and management of patients in multidisciplinary clinical setting, as well as a very thorough informed consent process are essential to ensuring the best possible treatment and outcome.",Excluded

2205,"Risk factors for surgical site infections after craniotomy for primary brain tumors. Surgical site infection (SSI) after craniotomy for primary CNS tumors can have detrimental consequences by delaying chemoradiation treatment. The authors performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent craniotomies for resection of primary brain tumors at the Moffitt Cancer Center from 2004-2014. Multivariate logistic analysis was used to identify independent risk factors. A total of 864 patients underwent craniotomies for primary brain tumors, but 65 were excluded due to insufficient followup or incomplete records. We identified 30 patients with SSI (3.8%). The most common microorganisms isolated from SSI were methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (40%), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (17%), methicillin resistant Streptococcus epidermidis (7%), Pseudomonas (7%), Enterobacteriaceae (7%), and E coli (7%). During the latter part of this time period, we initiated a program of intraoperative topical vancomycin application. We observed a significant reduction in SSI among those receiving topical vancomycin compared to those without (0.8% vs 4.9%, p<0.001). The cohorts were similar in demographics and baseline comorbidities, KPS, tumor characteristics, and surgical factors. We identified length-of-stay, previous radiation and preoperative steroid dose as independent risk factors for SSI. Thus, our study identifies potential modifiable risk factors for the prevention of SSI in patient undergoing craniotomy for primary CNS tumors.",Excluded

As an approach to determining the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of each of five different heavy ions for the mammalian brain, histological preparations of brains from mice exposed to various HZE particles at different doses and primary LETinfinity values were examined by means of semi-automated image analysis for volume changes in specific regions of the olfactory bulb. The mice were irradiated at 100 days of age and euthanatized about 500 days (16 months) later. Exposures were: 60Co gamma photons (LETinfinity = 1-2 keV/micrometer), 4He (LETinfinity = 6 keV/micrometer), 12C (LETinfinity = 80 keV/micrometer), 20Ne (LETinfinity = 150 keV/micrometer), 56Fe (LETinfinity = 180 keV/micrometer), and 40Ar (LETinfinity = 650 keV/micrometer). Animals receiving particle radiation were exposed in an extended Bragg peak region except for iron where the plateau region was used. The zones measured in the olfactory bulb were 1) the external plexiform layer (zone) and 2) an internal region consisting of the granule cells, internal plexiform layer, and layer of mitral cells. These studies indicated that volume changes did indeed occur, not only in absolute terms but also when expressed as the ratio of the structures to each other and to the bulb as a whole. Although this study is exploratory in character, the data obtained may nevertheless contribute to a determination of risk factors due to late effects from HZE articles.",Included
2207,"The effect of rowing ergometry and resistive exercise on skeletal muscle structure and function during bed rest. Exposure to microgravity causes functional and structural impairment of skeletal muscle. Current exercise regimens are time-consuming and insufficiently effective; an integrated countermeasure is needed that addresses musculoskeletal along with cardiovascular health. High-intensity, short-duration rowing ergometry and supplemental resistive strength exercise may achieve these goals. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers completed 5 wk of head-down-tilt bed rest (HDBR): 18 were randomized to exercise, 9 remained sedentary. Exercise consisted of rowing ergometry 6 days/wk, including interval training, and supplemental strength training 2 days/wk. Measurements before and after HDBR and following reambulation included assessment of strength, skeletal muscle volume (MRI), and muscle metabolism (magnetic resonance spectroscopy); quadriceps muscle biopsies were obtained to assess muscle fiber types, capillarization, and oxidative capacity. Sedentary bed rest (BR) led to decreased muscle volume (quadriceps: -9 +/- 4%, P < 0.001; plantar flexors: -19 +/- 6%, P < 0.001). Exercise (ExBR) reduced atrophy in the quadriceps (-5 +/- 4%, interaction P = 0.018) and calf muscle, although to a lesser degree (-14 +/- 6%, interaction P = 0.076). Knee extensor and plantar flexor strength was impaired by BR (-14 +/- 15%, P = 0.014 and -22 +/- 7%, P = 0.001) but preserved by ExBR (-4 +/- 13%, P = 0.238 and +13 +/- 28%, P = 0.011). Metabolic capacity, as assessed by maximal O2 consumption, (31)P-MRS, and oxidative chain enzyme activity, was impaired in BR but stable or improved in ExBR. Reambulation reversed the negative impact of BR. High-intensity, short-duration rowing and supplemental strength training effectively preserved skeletal muscle function and structure while partially preventing atrophy in key antigravity muscles. Due to its integrated cardiovascular benefits, rowing ergometry could be a primary component of exercise prescriptions for astronauts or patients suffering from severe deconditioning.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: We studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing pneumonectomy after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation for non-small cell lung cancer.METHODS: Clinical records of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent pneumonectomy at our institution between 1995 and 2005 after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation were reviewed retrospectively.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients underwent pneumonectomy after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation. Of the 21 men and 8 women who were treated, 1 had stage IIB (T3N0M0) and the remainder had stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Mean patient age at surgery was 53.4 years. There were 15 right pneumonectomies, of which 2 were for pancoast tumors. All patients received concurrent preoperative chemoradiation. Mean total radiation dose was 61.1 Gy. All patients went on to have complete (R0) resection by pneumonectomy. Pathologic complete response was found in 16 patients (55.2%). All patients were discharged alive from the hospital after pneumonectomy. Median hospital length of stay was 5 days (mean 8.6). Ninety-day mortality after surgery was 3.4% (n = 1). Recurrences have been found in 11 patients (38%), including brain metastases (n = 6), bone metastases (n = 4), liver metastases (n = 2), and cervical lymph node metastases (n = 2). One patient had a contralateral new primary lung cancer develop 70 months after undergoing pneumonectomy. Estimated 5-year disease-free survival is 48%. Median survival time has not been reached.CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonectomy can be performed safely after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, even with high-dose radiation. The frequency of disease recurrence in the brain underscores the need to evaluate the role of prophylactic cranial radiation in non-small cell lung cancer.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Radiopeptide therapy using a somatostatin analogue labelled with a beta emitter such as (90)Y/(177)Lu-DOTATOC is a new therapeutic option in neuroendocrine cancer. Alternative treatments for patients with refractory disease are rare. Here we report the first-in-human experience with (213)Bi-DOTATOC targeted alpha therapy (TAT) in patients pretreated with beta emitters.METHODS: Seven patients with progressive advanced neuroendocrine liver metastases refractory to treatment with (90)Y/(177)Lu-DOTATOC were treated with an intraarterial infusion of (213)Bi-DOTATOC, and one patient with bone marrow carcinosis was treated with a systemic infusion of (213)Bi-DOTATOC. Haematological, kidney and endocrine toxicities were assessed according to CTCAE criteria. Radiological response was assessed with contrast-enhanced MRI and (68)Ga-DOTATOC-PET/CT. More than 2 years of follow-up were available in seven patients.RESULTS: The biodistribution of (213)Bi-DOTATOC was evaluable with 440 keV gamma emission scans, and demonstrated specific tumour binding. Enduring responses were observed in all treated patients. Chronic kidney toxicity was moderate. Acute haematotoxicity was even less pronounced than with the preceding beta therapies.CONCLUSION: TAT can induce remission of tumours refractory to beta radiation with favourable acute and mid-term toxicity at therapeutic effective doses.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) with hippocampus sparing (HS) has been investigated by the radiation oncology working group (RTOG) 0933 trial for patients with multiple brain metastases. They showed a decrease of adverse neurocognitive effects with HS WBRT compared to WBRT alone. With the development of automated treatment planning system (aTPS) in the last years, a standardization of the plan quality at a high level was achieved. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using an aTPS for the treatment of HS WBRT and see if the RTOG 0933 dose constraints could be achieved and improved.METHODS: Ten consecutive patients treated with HS WBRT were enrolled in this study. 10 x 3 Gy was prescribed according to the RTOG 0933 protocol to 92% of the target volume (whole-brain excluding the hippocampus expanded by 5 mm in 3-dimensions). In contrast to RTOG 0933, the maximum allowed point dose to normal brain was significantly lowered and restricted to 36.5 Gy. All patients were planned with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique using four arcs. Plans were optimized using Auto-Planning (AP) (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems) with one single AP template and optimization.RESULTS: All the constraints from the RTOG 0933 trial were achieved. A significant improvement for the maximal dose to 2% of the brain with a reduction of 4 Gy was achieved (33.5 Gy vs. RTOG 37.5 Gy) and the minimum hippocampus dose was reduced by 10% (8.1 Gy vs. RTOG 9 Gy). A steep dose gradient around the hippocampus was achieved with a mean dose of 27.3 Gy at a distance between 0.5 cm and 1 cm from the hippocampus. The effective working time to optimize a plan was kept below 6'.CONCLUSION: Automated treatment planning for HS WBRT was able to fulfil all the recommendations from the RTOG 0933 study while significantly improving dose homogeneity and decreasing unnecessary hot spot in the normal brain. With this approach, a standardization of plan quality was achieved and the effective time required for plan optimization was minimized.",Excluded
2215,"Electrophysiological characterisation of the infrared organ of the Australian ""Little Ash Beetle"" Acanthocnemus nigricans (Coleoptera, Acanthocnemidae). This study characterises the response properties of the sensilla located on the prothoracic disc organ of the beetle Acanthocnemus nigricans, such as intensity response functions and temporal coding properties. Warming the sensilla by a red laser accelerated their ongoing spiking activity, cessation of the stimulus suppressed their firing as revealed by extracellular recordings. Convective heat sources also increased sensillum activity, but stimuli of other modalities failed to elicit responses. The response threshold was between 11 and 25 mW/cm2 and latencies ranged between 20 and 40 ms. Repeating stimuli with frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz were reliably resolved by the sensilla. This temporal resolution enables the disc sensilla to represent behaviourally relevant changes in heat stimuli in a thermally patchy environment.

Background: Immune-modulatory proteins HLA-G and HLA-E were originally thought to be restricted to the protection of the fetus from maternal allorecognition. Now they are known for multiple immune-regulatory functions. We already described production of immune-modulatory molecules HLA-G and HLA-E by both microglial cells (Kren, L. et al., J Neuroimmunol 2010) and neoplastic cells (Kren, L. et al. Neuropathology 2011). We described the unexpected positive correlation of HLA-E expression by neoplastic cells in glioblastoma (GB) with the length of survival, which we hypothetized could be attributable to subsequent therapeutic modalities. Therefore, we decided to analyse the expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in three GB cell lines before and after the impact of ionizing radiation. Design(s): We used three GB cell lines: T 98G, A172 and U 87MG. The expression of HLA-G and HLA-E was assessed before application of ionizing radiation (0-2-5-10-15- 20 Gy) and then was analysed again 24h and 72 h after radiation. HLA-G and HLA-E antigens were analysed flow-cytometrically. Result(s): The expression of both HLA-G and HLA-E by all three cell lines of GB was elevated significantly after irradiation, expecially expression of HLA-E in the line T 98G. (Graph Presented) Conclusion(s): We revealed that expression of HLA-G and HLA-E in GB cell lines alters significantly after the impact of ionizing radiation. This finding may represent a new, unrecognized pathway of the effect of ionizing radiation in cancer therapy.

To study the optimization of proton beam arrangements for various intraocular tumor locations; and to correlate isodose distributions with various target and nontarget structures. We considered posterior-central, nasal, and temporal tumor locations, with straight, intrarotated, or extrarotated eye positions. Doses of 46 cobalt grey equivalent (CGE) to gross tumor volume (GTV) and 40 CGE to clinical target volume (CTV) (2 CGE per fraction) were assumed. Using three-dimensional planning, we compared isodose distributions for lateral, anterolateral oblique, and anteromedial oblique beams and dose-volume histograms of CTVs, GTVs, lens, lacrimal gland, bony orbit, and soft tissues. All beam arrangements fully covered GTVs and CTVs with optimal lens sparing. Only 15% of orbital bone received doses <20 CGE with a lateral beam, with 20-26 CGE delivered to two of three growth centers. The anterolateral oblique approach with an intrarotated eye resulted in additional reduction of bony volume and exposure of only one growth center. No appreciable dose was delivered to the contralateral eye, brain tissue, or pituitary gland. Proton therapy achieved homogeneous target coverage with true lens sparing. Doses to orbit structures, including bony growth centers, were minimized with different beam arrangements and eye positions. Proton therapy could reduce the risks of second malignancy and cosmetic and functional sequelae. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

The paper describes for the first time the results of the radiation effect study using the example of the analysis of circulatory system disease mortality in newly established cohort combining the population exposed in 1950-1960 due to 2 radiation incidents in the Southern Urals (the Techa River and East-Urals radioactive Trace). The cohort consists of 60,205 people. Over a 65-year follow up period 14,830 deaths from all diseases of the circulatory system were registered. Out of this number 6,163 deaths were from ischemic heart disease, and 4,388 deaths were from cerebrovascular diseases. Analysis was performed on the basis of individualized estimates of dose accumulated in muscle tissue (both internal and external components of the dose), calculated with new Techa River Dosimetry System 2016. As per the latest calculations, mean dose to muscle tissue in members of the combined cohort was 34 mGy, maximum dose was 995 mGy. Simple parametric model of excess relative risk (ERR) was used in the analysis. The number of person-years at risk was 1836,203. The findings of the analysis show linear increase of mortality risk per unit dose from all the disease of circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy was 3%; 95% CI: 0,8%; 5,2%) and from ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy was 9,2%; 95% CI: 5,4%; 13,5%). with 15-year latent period. No statistically significant increase in mortality from the cerebrovascular diseases in the combined cohort of the population exposed in the Southern Urals over a 65-year period received evidence. The obtained results are in good agreement with those received in the analysis of the effect in the Techa River Cohort in 2013. The latter covered a 53-year period (with minimum latent period of 15 years) and revealed statistically significant linear dose response for all diseases of the circulatory system (ERR/100 mGy - 0.036) and ischemic heart disease (ERR/100 mGy - 0.056).

The widespread use of wireless telecommunications devices, particularly mobile phones, has resulted in increased human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields. Although national and international agencies have established safety guidelines for exposure to RF fields, concerns remain about the potential for adverse health outcomes to occur in relation to RF field exposure. The extensive literature on RF fields and health has been reviewed by a number of authorities, including the Royal Society of Canada (1999), the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity, and the Environment (CSTEE, 2001), the British Medical Association (2001), the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority (Boice & McLaughlin, 2002), and the Health Council of the Netherlands (2002). This report provides an update on recent research results on the potential health risks of RF fields since the publication of the Royal Society of Canada report in 1999 (See Krewski et al., 2001a) and our previous 2001 update (Krewski et al., 2001b), covering the period 2001-2003. The present report examines new data on dosimetry and exposure assessment, biological effects such as enzyme induction, and toxicological effects, including genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and testicular and reproductive outcomes. Epidemiological studies of mobile phone users and occupationally exposed populations are examined, along with human and animal studies of neurological and behavioral effects. All of the authoritative reviews completed within the last 2 yr have concluded that there is no clear evidence of adverse health effects associated with RF fields. However, following a recent review of nine epidemiological studies of mobile phones and cancer, Kundi et al. (2004) concluded that the possibility of an enhanced cancer risk cannot be excluded. These same reviews support the need for further research to clarify the possible associations between RF fields and adverse health outcomes that have appeared in some reports. The results of the ongoing World Health Organization (WHO) study of mobile phones will provide important new information in this regard. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Excluded

The proposed deep space exploration to the moon and later to Mars will result in astronauts receiving significant chronic exposures to space radiation (SR). SR exposure results in multiple neurocognitive impairments. Recently, our cross-species (mouse/rat) studies reported impaired associative memory formation in both species following a chronic 6-month low dose exposure to a mixed field of neutrons (1 mGy/day for a total dose pf 18 cGy). In the present study, we report neutron exposure induced synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex, accompanied by microglial activation and significant synaptic loss in the hippocampus. In a parallel study, neutron exposure was also found to alter fluorescence assisted single synaptosome LTP (FASS-LTP) in the hippocampus of rats, that may be related to a reduced ability to insert AMPAR into the post-synaptic membrane, which may arise from increased phosphorylation of the serine 845 residue of the GluA1 subunit. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time, that low dose chronic neutron irradiation impacts homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-cortical circuit in two rodent species, and that the ability to successfully encode associative recognition memory is a dynamic, multicircuit process, possibly involving compensatory changes in AMPAR density on the synaptic surface.",Included
2223,"Higher seizure susceptibility in rats with cortical dysplasia: A feedback systems perspective. Rationale: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is one of the leading causes of drug resistant focal epilepsy. Despite significant advances in various diagnostic and therapeutic methods, the basic mechanisms of higher susceptibility for seizures in patients with CD remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to develop a mathematical framework using principles from second order system dynamics to further characterize the effect of a ""second hit"" [acute single pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure] in animal model of in utero radiation-induced CD as compared to a PTZ induced seizure in normal control rat. Method(s): CD was induced through in utero irradiation of 4 pregnant Sprague Dawley rats at E17 with 145 cGy. Fourteen litters (XRT) were implanted with intracortical depth electrodes targeting the right and left frontal and parietal cortex. A set of 27 aged matched normal rats served as controls. All rats were injected with PTZ at 40 mg/kg. Post PTZ injection, all 14 XRT rats developed seizures (Group 1), 17 out of 27 normal rats developed seizures (Group 2) and in 10 normal rats, PTZ injection failed to induce seizures (Group 3). The flow diagram of experimental steps involved is provided in Fig. 1A. To characterize the response of the abnormal/normal brain to PTZ, the average gamma coherence (Cr) across all pairs of electrode and across all rats within a group was computed for the entire duration of recording (24 hours). The Cr profile can be viewed as the impulse response of an over-damped 2nd order system (See Fig.1C), the impulse function being the PTZ injection. The system parameters can then be estimated by fitting Eq.1 to Cr. Result(s): Fig. 1B shows Cr profile and the fitted data for the 3 groups of rats. Table 1, shows the location of poles s1, s2, the under-damped natural frequency (omegan) and the damping ratio of the system (xi). The slow pole s1 represents the long-term effects of the PTZ injection whereas the fast pole s2 dictates the immediate reaction of the system to external perturbation. Note that the slow pole is similar across the 3 groups (Fig. 1D). The location of the pole represents the stability of the system. The location of fast pole is closest to the imaginary axes for XRT rats and hence is suggestive of a less stable system. The lowest damping ratio is for the XRT rat, followed by rats in Group 2 and Group 3. A high damping ratio indicates that the system is resistive to oscillations caused by external perturbations. Conclusion(s): Our study shows that there exists an internal feedback mechanism within the brain of normal rats which reduces its susceptibility to epileptogenesis. We hypothesize that this feedback control mechanism is dysfunctional within the dysplastic (CD) rat brain. Support for this claim is provided by the relatively lower damping ratio and location of the fast pole of the CD rats (p<0.01). Translation of this concept to human studies using neurostimulation paradigms may provide a novel methodology to characterize and measure epileptogenicity in abnormal/normal tissues. Our future work will be targeted along these lines. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

Gene expression profiles in the cortex of adult Long-Evans rats as a function of a stressful social loss and victory in inter-male fighting encounters were examined. This social dominance and subordination model has been postulated to simulate early changes in the onset of depression in the losers. Microarrays were fabricated containing 45mer oligonucleotides spotted in quadruplicate and representing 1178 brain-associated genes.

2229,"Outwitting the blood-brain barrier for therapeutic purposes: osmotic opening and other means. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews historical aspects of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and recent advances in mechanisms to deliver therapeutic agents across the BBB for the treatment of intracerebral tumors and other neurological diseases.METHODS: The development of the osmotic BBB disruption procedure as a clinically useful technique is described. Osmotic BBB disruption is contrasted with alternative methods for opening or bypassing the BBB, including pharmacological modification of the BBB with bradykinin and direct intracerebral infusion.RESULTS: Laboratory studies have played a fundamental role in advancing our understanding of the BBB and delivery of agents to brain. Preclinical animal studies will continue to serve an integral function in our efforts to improve the diagnosis and treatment of a number of neurological disorders. Techniques involving the modification of the BBB and/or blood-tumor barrier to increase delivery of therapeutic agents have been advanced to clinical trials in patients with brain tumors with very favorable results.CONCLUSION: Improving delivery of agents to the brain will play a major role in the therapeutic outcome of brain neoplasms. As techniques for gene therapy are advanced, manipulation of the BBB also may be important in the treatment of central nervous system genetic disorders. [References: 77]",Excluded
2230,"On-demand optogenetic control of spontaneous seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common type of epilepsy in adults, is often medically refractory, and due to broad actions and long-time scales, current systemic treatments have major negative side-effects. However, temporal lobe seizures tend to arise from discrete regions before overt clinical behaviour, making temporally and spatially specific treatment theoretically possible. Here we report the arrest of spontaneous seizures using a real-time, closed-loop, response system and in vivo optogenetics in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Either optogenetic inhibition of excitatory principal cells, or activation of a subpopulation of GABAergic cells representing <5% of hippocampal neurons, stops seizures rapidly upon light application. These results demonstrate that spontaneous temporal lobe seizures can be detected and terminated by modulating specific cell populations in a spatially restricted manner. A clinical approach built on these principles may overcome many of the side-effects of currently available treatment options.",Excluded

2232,"Evaluation of metastases in the submandibular gland in head and neck malignancy. BACKGROUND: : Either excision of the submandibular gland during neck dissection or having the submandibular gland in radiation field can result in xerostomia, leading to reduced quality of life. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of metastasis to the submandibular gland and to identify potential risk factors leading to the presence of metastases into the gland.PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Of 376 patients with head and neck malignancy who were treated between 1999 and 2008, 130 patients underwent a neck dissection, and in total, 171 submandibular glands were removed. The average age was 61.1 years.RESULTS: : Twenty-three patients (17.7%) revealed some type of pathology in the submandibular gland such as chronic sialadenitis (15), atrophy (5), tumor infiltration (5), and intraglandular lymph node (1). In the group with sialadenitis, the mean age was 57.7 years. Forty-four percent had a pretreatment (radiation, 9%; local resection, 13%; or combined therapy, 22%) before neck dissection. Of the sialadenitis group, 9 of 12 patients had the primary tumor in the lower jaw, floor of mouth, or tongue.CONCLUSIONS: : One needs to be aware of the possibility of occult metastases in level I in oral cavity carcinomas, whereas oropharynx carcinoma constitutes a lower risk for involvement of lymph node metastases at level I. The excision of the submandibular gland should be performed in cases with positive lymph nodes at level I and in tumor sites with a high risk of occult metastasis at level I.",Excluded

Cranial radiation is routinely and increasingly used to manage various types of tumors. Both traumatic brain injury and brain radiotherapy are a frequent and overlooked cause of abnormalities in hypothalamic-pituitary axis function or sometimes even of overt pituitary disorders altering patients' health and quality of life. Because clinical manifestations may be subtle and develop insidiously many years after injury or radiotherapy, establishing a correct diagnosis is not always straightforward. Diagnosis of hypopituitarism and accurate treatment of pituitary disorders offers the opportunity to improve mortality and outcome in both groups of patients. The purpose of this paper is to review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury- or radiotherapy-induced pituitary disturbances with a special emphasis on the most recent literature.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to compare arc-based and mini-multileaf collimator (mMLC)-based radiosurgery treatment plans using isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms.METHODS: Of 11 patients who underwent conventional arc-based radiosurgery for intracranial malignancies, four were treated with one isocenter, four were treated with two isocenters and three were treated with three isocenters. The same cases were re-planned using a test version of mMLC-based radiosurgery software for multiple static non-coplanar fields.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: For non-spherical targets, treatment planning is relatively intuitive with mMLC-based radiosurgery, reducing the amount of time required for planning. Moreover, a lower dose of radiation is delivered to normal tissue with mMLC-based radiosurgery than with arc-based radiosurgery, which theoretically should lead to a reduced risk of complications.",Excluded

Background: Four cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin and accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy (AHTRT) is the standard of care for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Irinotecan plus cisplatin significantly improved overall survival compared with etoposide plus cisplatin for extensive-stage SCLC. We compared these regimens for overall survival of patients with limited-stage SCLC. Method(s): We did this phase 3 study in 36 institutions in Japan. Eligibility criteria included age 20-70 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate organ functions. Eligible patients with previously untreated limited-stage SCLC received one cycle of etoposide plus cisplatin (intravenous etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-3; intravenous cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) plus AHTRT (1.5 Gy twice daily, 5 days a week, total 45 Gy over 3 weeks). Patients without progressive disease following induction therapy were randomised (1:1 ratio, using a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment balancing on ECOG performance status [0 vs 1], response to induction chemoradiotherapy [complete response plus near complete response vs partial response and stable disease], and institution) to receive either three further cycles of consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin or irinotecan plus cisplatin (intravenous irinotecan 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, 15; intravenous cisplatin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1). Patients, physicians, and investigators were aware of allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival after randomisation; primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00144989, and the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number C000000095. Finding(s): 281 patients were enrolled between Sept 1, 2002, and Oct 2, 2006. After induction etoposide plus cisplatin and AHTRT, 258 patients were randomised to consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin (n=129) or irinotecan plus cisplatin (n=129). In the etoposide plus cisplatin group, median overall survival was 3.2 years (95% CI 2.4-4.1). In the irinotecan and cisplatin group, median overall survival was 2.8 years (95% CI 2.4-3.6); overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.09 [95% CI 0.80-1.46], one-sided stratified log-rank p=0.70). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (120 [95%] in the etoposide plus cisplatin group vs 101 [78%] in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group), anaemia (44 [35%] vs 50 [39%]), thrombocytopenia (26 [21%] vs six [5%]), febrile neutropenia (21 [17%] vs 18 [14%]), and diarrhoea (two [2%] vs 13 [10%]). There was one treatment-related adverse event leading to death in each group (radiation pneumonitis in the etoposide plus cisplatin group; brain infarction in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group).

Combination therapy using anticancer drugs and nucleic acid is a more promising strategy to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer and to enhance apoptosis. In this study, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs), which contain both pemetrexed and miR-21 antisense oligonucleotide (anti-miR-21), have been developed for treatment of glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain tumor. Prepared LPNs have been well characterized by particle size distribution and zeta potential measurements, determination of encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release experiments. Morphology of LPNs was determined by transmission electron microscopy. LPNs had a hydrodynamic size below 100 nm and exhibited sustained release of pemetrexed up to 10 h. Encapsulation of pemetrexed in LPNs increased cellular uptake from 6% to 78%. Results of confocal microscopy analysis have shown that co-delivery of anti-miR-21 significantly improved accumulation of LPNs in the nucleus of U87MG cells. Nevertheless, more effective cytotoxicity results could not be obtained due to low concentration of anti-miR-21, loaded in LPNs. We expect that the effective drug delivery systems can be obtained with higher concentration of anti-miR-21 for the treatment of glioblastoma.

2240,"Comparison between dose values specified at the ICRU reference point and the mean dose to the planning target volume. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare dose values specified at the reference point, as recommended by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, ICRU, and the mean dose to the planning target volume, PTV.MATERIAL AND METHODS: CT-based dose calculations were performed with a 3-D treatment planning system for 6 series of patients treated for bladder, brain, breast, lung, oropharynx and parotid gland tumour. All patients were arbitrarily chosen from a set of previously treated patients irradiated with a two- or three-field technique using customised blocks. Appropriate wedge angles and beam weights were chosen to make the dose distribution as homogeneous as possible.RESULTS: The dose at the ICRU reference point was generally higher than the mean dose to the PTV. The difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV for an individual patient was less than 3% in 88% of cases and less than 2% in 72% of the cases. The differences were larger in those patients where the dose distribution is significantly influenced by the presence of lungs or air gaps. For each series of patients the mean difference between the ICRU reference dose and the mean dose to the PTV was calculated. The difference between these two values never exceeded 2%. Because not all planning systems are able to calculate the mean dose to the PTV, the concept of the mean central dose, the mean of the dose values at the centre of the PTV in each CT slice, has been introduced. The mean central dose was also calculated for the same patients and was closer to the mean dose to the PTV than the ICRU reference dose.CONCLUSION: The mean dose to the PTV is well estimated by either the ICRU reference dose or the mean central dose for a variety of treatment techniques for common types of cancer.",Excluded

Dosimetry was performed according to MIRD scheme. Eleven NET patients who had undergone splenectomy before PRRNT and who received 4.7-7.6 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE or (177)Lu-DOTATOC were selected as controls.

Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans with a poor clinical outcome. Although no contemporary therapies are completely curative combined chemo-radiation (STUPP) has led to improved overall survival. Therefore development of new targeted drugs and their combination with radiation offer new treatment possibilities. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the radiosensitizing abilities of ZRBA1combi-molecule designed to block bothEGFR-TKsignaling pathways while additionally inducing significant levels of DNA damage. In cancer cells the binary property ofZRBA1can be limited byDNArepair mechanismtherefore in order to increase its efficacy we combined this drug with ionizing radiation. The effect of ZRBA1 on the radiosensitivity of three human glioblastoma cell lines (U87, U343 and U373) was evaluated using MTT and clonogenic assays whereas DNA damage/repair and cell cycle were evaluated using gH2AX antibody and FACS assay. Our results demonstrate that exposure of cells to 25uM of ZRBA1 resulted in an increase in radiosensitivity of all tested cell lines with dose enhancement factors at a surviving fraction of 0.1 ranging from 1.4 to 1.7. Importantly, in contrast to Temozolomide which enhances radiation response most effectively in MGMT-negative cells, radiosensitizing proprieties of ZRBA1 does not depend on theMGMTmethylation status. Additionally, as a measure ofDNAdouble strand breaks, the number of gH2AXfoci per cell was significantly greater at 24h after the combined modality compared with the individual treatments with radiation, Temozolomide or ZRBA1 alone. Overall, our results have demonstrated of increased levels of DNA double strand breaks when ZRBA1 was combined with radiation and suggests that the radiosensitizing proprieties of ZRBA1 relay on inhibition of DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. Therefore we postulate that ZRBA1 may be developed as a potent and innovative radiosensitizing agent for malignant glioma tumors.",Excluded

No prior chest imaging was available. Patient was discharged after appendectomy and was advised to have follow up imaging, but was thereafter lost to follow up. Two years later patient presented with productive cough and scant hemoptysis. A CTscan of the chest then revealed a 6.7 cm lung mass. Carcinoid tumor was suspected but octreotide scan was negative. A CT guided lung biopsy revealed adeno-carcinoma positive for EGFR mutation. Three weeks later patient was admitted with headache and right arm weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed left sided metastases in parietal and occipital lobe, confirming stage IV disease IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Risk of a lung nodule being malignant depends on size, consistency and patient risk factors. The risk of malignancy in a nodule of 5 mm is < 1 %, 5-9 mm is 2-6%, 8-20 mm is 18% and > 20 mm is 50%. Solid nodules are at greater risk than semi solid and ground glass nodules. Significant risk factors include cigarette smoking, age> 35 years, female gender, exposure to radiation or environmental toxins, pulmonary fibrosis, alcohol consumption and positive family history. According to Fleischner society guidelines a lung nodule > 8 mm should be either resected for biopsy in patients with risk factors for lung cancer, or followed up with CT chest in 3 months in low risk patients. In patients under 35 years old with no risk factors, the chance of a lung nodule proving to be malignant is < 3%. It has also been noted that patients with nodules between 8-30 mm and concern of poor follow up (due to socioeconomic status, psychological issues, young age) should undergo either non-surgical biopsy or video assisted thoracoscopic surgery with wedge resection. Lung adenocarcinoma commonly presents as a pulmonary nodule. 5 year survival rate of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma is < 10 % while for stage I it is 60-80%. The patient in this case presented 2 years after the finding of an incidental nodule with cancer that had progressed to stage IV. We suggest that timely intervention with biopsy of the nodule on first presentation could have altered this course. Conclusion(s): Guidelines should be used in the proper clinical context as a tool to help in patient management as exceptions always exist. In any patient, including young patients with no risk factors for lung cancer presenting with nodules > 8 mm in size, there should be significant clinical suspicion of malignancy.

The authors present our institute's experience in combined modality management of 15 successive patients of HPC. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 15 patients of HPC treated in our institute from 2001 to 2011. Clinical characteristics and treatment modality, in the form of surgery and radiotherapy, were noted. Statistical analysis was done with regards to recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results The median age of the patients was 40.0 years. Nine patients were males and six patients were females. The median duration of symptoms was six months. Headache was the most common presenting symptom followed by vomiting, motor weakness and seizures. Twelve patients underwent total excision while three had subtotal excision. Seven patients had WHO grade II histology tumors and eight patients had grade III histology. Thirteen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Median RT dose delivered was 50 Gy. Five patients developed local recurrence. One patient had distant metastases. Median duration of RFS was 68 months. Conclusions HPCs are aggressive tumors.

Objective: To examine the gene expression alterations in a rat's brain, treated by non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation from 900MHz-GSM mobile phone is main aim of this study. Background(s): As studies supported electromagnetic radiation may cause membrane leakage due to loss of calcium. Membrane leakage of lysosomes release DNAase which explains the fragmentation of DNA seen in cells exposed to mobile phone signals. Damage to DNA is a fundamental mechanism for developing tumors and cancer. The possibility of retaining mutations and cancer starting depends on when DNA damage exceeds the rate of DNA repair. DNA damage in brain cells can affect neurological functions and also possibly lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Method(s): In this study, we investigated whether an exposure of GSM-900 MHz irradiation from the Mobile Phone (3hours/day up to 28 days) could lead to the modulation of gene expression pattern in the rat brain. All rats were habitualised for one week prior to start the experiment in well designed circular mobile phone exposure (CCPE) cage. CCPE cage was specially designed for EMR exposure by mobile phone on the rats in the natural environment and it placed inside the exposure room where other electric appliances were not installed. In the cage, a mobile phone was placed in the center and rats were allowed to move around the device within 10 cm. radius. After 28 days, mRNA from the brain of control, sham and GSM-900 MHz exposed rats were isolated and subjected to Quantitative Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) array analysis. Gene expression was measured and expressed in fold change as described by Bandhyopadhay et.al. (2006). The qRT-PCR was performed by using Sybr green chemistry on ABI 7900HT platform. The real time quantification of amplification was done by measuring change in fluorescence by SDS2.3 software and further analyze by RQ manager. Result(s): Thus the results obtained from this study have shown that there is no significant change in expressions of genes involved in DNA damage and repair pathways such as chromatin assembly (CHAF1A), DNA damage checkpoints (Chk1), DNA synthesis (POLD1), post-transcriptional processes (RBM4), translation synthesis (POLI) and stress signaling (Hsp90) as compared with controls.

Objective We aim to determine the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of recurrent CNSL. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of patients having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for recurrent intracranial CNSL between 1999 and 2011. Results Fourteen patients (20 tumors) underwent SRS. The median patient age was 71 years (range, 18-82 years). Seven patients (50%) had primary CNSL. All had received prior chemotherapy, and nine patients (64%) had undergone prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with a median dose of 40 Gy in 25 fractions. The median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Score was 80. The median tumor volume was 6.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 0.5-37.7); the median margin dose was 15.5 Gy (range, 10-18). Eleven patients (79%) had tumor regression (n = 11) shown on MRI after SRS. The median overall survival after SRS was 9.5 months. No patient had a major radiation-related complication. Conclusion Stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with recurrent CNSL is well tolerated and has a high rate of radiographic response. A marginal dose of 15.5 Gy or greater, a Karnofsky score of 80 or greater, and the absence of pre-SRS WBRT were associated with significantly longer overall survival.

A treatment plan was generated using a 4 mm radiosurgery cone such that one portion of the tumor receives 100% dose of 60 Gy sufficient to cause necrosis, whereas the tumor edge at depth receives only 50% or less dose, allowing for regrowth of the tumor. The brains were collected 10 weeks after irradiation and immuno-histological analysis was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed central liquefaction necrosis in the high dose region consistent with necrosis and viable tumor in the peripheral low dose region. Ki-67 staining showed highly proliferative tumor cells surrounding the necrotic parts of the tumor. Luxol fast blue and lectin staining showed demyelination and vascular injury in brain tissue consistent with radiation necrosis. We have developed a novel model of radiation necrosis in rats bearing glioma.",Excluded
2254,"Massive gastrointestinal bleeding from choriocarcinoma of the ovary. Choriocarcinoma of the ovary is a rare neoplasm and tends to metastasize early to involve the lungs, brain, and liver. Metastasis to the gastrointestinal tract is rare. We report the case of a young lady, who presented with life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding, secondary to jejunal involvement. The site of bleeding was localized using a computed tomography angiogram following inconclusive upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies. The bleeding jejunal segment was resected and the metastatic disease responded to combination chemotherapy. Metastatic choriocarcinoma of the ovary should be considered a possible diagnosis in patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. Copyright © 2018, Oman Medical Specialty Board.

2255,"Autonomous Optimization of Targeted Stimulation of Neuronal Networks. Driven by clinical needs and progress in neurotechnology, targeted interaction with neuronal networks is of increasing importance. Yet, the dynamics of interaction between intrinsic ongoing activity in neuronal networks and their response to stimulation is unknown. Nonetheless, electrical stimulation of the brain is increasingly explored as a therapeutic strategy and as a means to artificially inject information into neural circuits. Strategies using regular or event-triggered fixed stimuli discount the influence of ongoing neuronal activity on the stimulation outcome and are therefore not optimal to induce specific responses reliably. Yet, without suitable mechanistic models, it is hardly possible to optimize such interactions, in particular when desired response features are network-dependent and are initially unknown. In this proof-of-principle study, we present an experimental paradigm using reinforcement-learning (RL) to optimize stimulus settings autonomously and evaluate the learned control strategy using phenomenological models. We asked how to (1) capture the interaction of ongoing network activity, electrical stimulation and evoked responses in a quantifiable 'state' to formulate a well-posed control problem, (2) find the optimal state for stimulation, and (3) evaluate the quality of the solution found. Electrical stimulation of generic neuronal networks grown from rat cortical tissue in vitro evoked bursts of action potentials (responses). We show that the dynamic interplay of their magnitudes and the probability to be intercepted by spontaneous events defines a trade-off scenario with a network-specific unique optimal latency maximizing stimulus efficacy. An RL controller was set to find this optimum autonomously. Across networks, stimulation efficacy increased in 90% of the sessions after learning and learned latencies strongly agreed with those predicted from open-loop experiments. Our results show that autonomous techniques can exploit quantitative relationships underlying activity-response interaction in biological neuronal networks to choose optimal actions. Simple phenomenological models can be useful to validate the quality of the resulting controllers.",Excluded
2256,"First-in-human phase 0 trial of oral 5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose (IPDR) in patients with advanced malignancies. Background: Iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd or IUDR), a halogenated nucleoside analog, has produced responses in patients with high-grade anaplastic astrocytomas and sarcomas when administered as a radiosensitizer via continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion over the course of radiation therapy. Since continuous i.v. infusion is impractical for several weeks of radiotherapy, we conducted a phase 0 trial of IPdR, an oral prodrug of IdUrd, in patients (pts) with advanced malignances. Prior to embarking on large-scale clinical trials, our objective was to determine whether the oral route was a feasible alternative to continuous i.v. infusion. Plasma concentrations of IPdR, IdUrd, and other metabolites were measured after a single oral dose of IPdR. Trial design: Eligible pts had advanced refractory malignancies; age >=18 years; ECOG PS <= 2; adequate organ function; were at least 2 weeks from prior anticancer therapy. All pts verbalized their understanding of the non-therapeutic nature of the trial prior to signing the consent form. A single oral dose of IPdR was administered per pt; dose escalations were planned (150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, 1200 mg, 2400 mg) with one pt per dose level and 6 pts at the highest dose level. Blood sampling was performed over a 24-hour period for pharmacokinetic analysis. All pts were followed for 14 days for safety assessments. Significant toxicities were defined as grade >=2 non-hematologic toxicities; grade >=2 thrombocytopenia; grade >=3 anemia, leucopenia, or neutropenia. If one pt developed significant toxicity, no additional patients were to be enrolled. Result(s): There were no drug-related adverse events. Ten pts were enrolled; median age 60 yrs (range 45-66 yrs); M/F 8/2; diagnosis (# of pts): thyroid (2), lymphoma (1), neuroendocrine (1), hepatocellular (1), adenoid cystic (1), bladder (1), colorectal (2), breast cancer (1). A dosedependent increase in the plasma concentration was observed for IdUrd from 150 mg to 2400 mg. At the 2400 mg dose, all 6 pts achieved peak IdUrd levels of (mean+/-SD) 4.0+/-1.02mM (25% CV) at 1.67+/-1.21 h. Peak levels of iodouracil, the major metabolite, were 133+/-42mM at 3.3+/-1.0 h post IPdR administration. Conclusion(s): Single-dose oral IPdR was well tolerated, and adequate plasma levels were obtained to justify proceeding with a phase I trial of IPdR in combination with radiation. This clinical investigation clearly demonstrates the ability of a small phase 0 study to determine the critical information that can shape the path for decision-making regarding future development of a drug.",Excluded

Background: Annually, more than 4,000 patients are diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) from breast cancer in the U.S. Since most therapies cannot cross the Blood-CSF-Barrier (BCB) and the Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB), treatment options for LC are limited to local radiation and few chemotherapy agents, none of which have provided durable clinical benefit, leading to short overall survival (OS) of 3-4 months. ANG1005 is a novel peptide-drug conjugate, consisting of 3 paclitaxel molecules covalently linked to a peptide that targets the LRP-1 receptor to cross both BCB and BBB, and enter the tumor cells, where the paclitaxel is cleaved off to exert its anti-tumor activity. ANG1005 has previously shown in a phase 2 study to prolong OS in LC patients from breast cancer with brain metastases (BM) to 8 months. Trial Design: This is an open-label, multi-center phase 3 randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of ANG1005 in HER2-negative breast cancer patients with newly diagnosed LC and documented history of previously treated BM when compared to Physician Best Choice (PBC). Hundred and fifty (150) patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either ANG1005 experimental treatment or an Investigator assigned PBCcontrol treatment. ANG1005 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at a starting dose of 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks. Allowed PBC therapies include capecitabine, eribulin, or high-dose IV methotrexate. CNS disease (LC and BM) will be evaluated at screening and every 6 weeks by MRI, CSF cytology and neurological assessments according to LANO and RANO-BM criteria. Extracranial disease will be evaluated by CT scans according to RECIST at screening and every 6-12 weeks. All patients will be foliowed for survival every 6-8 weeks from the date of the last dose until death, lost to follow-up or consent withdrawal. Eligibility Criteria: Eligible patients are adults (E 18 years old) with HER2-negative breast cancer, newly diagnosed LC and documented history of previously treated BM. Patients must be neurologically stable and have adequate blood counts, organ and bone marrow function with an ECOG status grade 2. Patients previously treated with ANG1005 or with known allergy to paclitaxel or its components are excluded. Specific aims: The primary endpoint is OS. Secondary endpoints include CNS (LC and BM) progression-free survival and clinical benefit rate, 6-and 12-month OS rates, LC response rate and duration of response, OS for triple negative patients and safety. Statistical Methods: This study is sized for testing the hypothesis of improved OS for ANG1005 versus PBC in all patients (HR=0.58, two-sided test, overall type 1 error of 5%). Interim analysis for OS (using O'Brien Fleming boundaries for efficacy and a fixed HR=1 for futility) will be performed when a total of 55 death events are reached across both arms.

2258,"A review of management strategies of malignant gliomas in the elderly population. Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumor in adults. It is an aggressive primary brain neoplasm, associated with a poor prognosis and median survival of less than 1 year. Approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with malignant gliomas in the United States are over the age of 65. Advancing age and poor performance status are two variables that have found to negatively affect prognosis. When compared to younger patients, not only is the treatment of elderly patients associated with decreased efficacy but also greater toxicity. As a result, elderly patients often receive less aggressive treatment and are excluded from clinical trials. There are many challenges in the treatment of elderly patients with GBM including increased surgical morbidity and mortality as well as increased toxicity to radiation and chemotherapy. As such, the optimal therapy remains unclear and controversial for the elderly malignant glioma population.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To determine the detection rate of intracranial vessel occlusions using CT perfusion-based wavelet-transformed angiography (waveletCTA) in acute ischemic stroke patients, in whom single-phase CTA (spCTA) failed to detect an occlusion.METHODS: Subjects were selected from a cohort of 791 consecutive patients who underwent multiparametric CT including whole-brain CT perfusion. Inclusion criteria were (1) significant cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficit, (2) no evidence of vessel occlusion on spCTA and (3) follow-up-confirmed acute ischemic infarction. waveletCTA was independently analysed by two readers regarding presence and location of vessel occlusions. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of waveletCTA-detected occlusions.RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall, an occlusion was identified using waveletCTA in 31 (52.5 %) patients with negative spCTA. Out of 47 patients with middle cerebral artery infarction, 27 occlusions (57.4 %) were detected by waveletCTA, mainly located in the M2 (15) and M3 segments (8). The presence of waveletCTA-detected occlusions was associated with larger CBF deficit volumes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.335, p = 0.010) and shorter times from symptom onset (OR = 0.306, p = 0.041).CONCLUSIONS: waveletCTA is able to detect spCTA occult vessel occlusions in about half of acute ischemic stroke patients and may potentially identify more patients eligible for endovascular therapy.KEY POINTS: * waveletCTA is able to detect spCTA occult vessel occlusions in stroke patients. * waveletCTA-detected occlusions are associated with larger cerebral blood flow deficits. * waveletCTA has the potential to identify more patients eligible for endovascular therapy. * waveletCTA implies neither additional radiation exposure nor extra contrast agent.",Excluded
2261,"Habituation of steady-state visual evoked potentials in response to high-frequency polychromatic foveal visual stimulation. In an attempt to develop safe and robust methods for monitoring migraineurs' brain states, we explores the feasibility of using white, red, green and blue LED lights flickering around their critical flicker fusion (CFF) frequencies as foveal visual stimuli for inducing steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and causing discernible habituation trends. After comparing the habituation indices, the multi-scale entropies and the time dependent intrinsic correlations of their SSVEP signals, we reached a tentative conclusion that sharp red and white light pulses flickering barely above their CFF frequencies can replace commonly used 13Hz stimuli to effectively cause SSVEP habituation among normal subjects. Empirical results showed that consecutive short bursts of light can produce more consistent responses than a single prolonged stimulation. Since these high frequency stimuli do not run the risk of triggering migraine or seizure attacks, further tests of these stimuli on migraine patients are warranted in order to verify their effectiveness.",Excluded

Over the course of 1 year (and 1996 procedures) we minimized cinegraphic frames and runs, as well as fluoroscopy time, and trained ourselves to achieve effective fluoroscopy-saving positioning of blinds and filters toward the regions of interest. We were consequently able to reduce the mean dose-area products (DAP) for coronary angiography and angioplasty, combined interventions, high-frequency rotational atherectomy, and excimer laser angioplasty: from levels of 53.9 Gy cm(2), 79.6 Gy cm(2), 112.3 Gy cm(2), 119.4 Gy cm(2), and 168.0 Gy cm(2) as currently reported in the literature, to 12.9 Gy cm(2), 13.3 Gy cm(2), 25.9 Gy cm(2), 33.0 Gy cm(2), and 27.1 Gy cm(2), respectively. The mean DAP due to interventions in acute myocardial infarction was 38.3 Gy cm(2). DAP was influenced by body mass index, complexity of coronary artery disease, tube angulation, documented structure, coronary recanalization, emergency circumstances, and the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) target vessel involved, but not by stent implantation. By favouring radiation-reducing cranial posteroanterior views over standard left anterior oblique views for visualization of the left anterior descending and the diagonal artery, we consequently achieved mean PTCA-DAPs of 10.4 Gy cm(2) and 8.6 Gy cm(2), respectively: levels significantly lower than those for PTCA of the right coronary artery (13.3 Gy cm(2)), left circumflex artery (13.7 Gy cm(2)), and obtuse marginal branch (16.9 Gy cm(2)).

These agents released NO in the cell culture media and inhibited the growth of the glioma cells. Growth-inhibition was attenuated by hemoglobin, a known inhibitor of NO, suggesting it is mediated by NO. When C6 and T98G cells were irradiated in the presence of SNAP or SNP at 100 microM, radiosensitization was observed. SNAP at 100 microM exhibited a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.4 for C6 cells and 1.8 for T98G cells. SNP at 100 microM only radiosensitized T98G cells with a SER of 1.9.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Innovative techniques and device-related advances have improved the outcomes of neuroendovascular treatment. 3D imaging has previously used 2 < 2 binning, but 1 < 1 binning has recently been made available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative ability of conebeam CT for stent delineation and to investigate its effectiveness in the clinical environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four acquisition groups of 3D MIP images acquired using conebeam CT with varying conditions (acquisition time, 10 or 20 seconds and binning, 1 < 1 or 2 < 2) were compared. Two methods of analysis were performed, a phantom study and an analysis of 28 randomly selected patients. The phantom study assessed the contrast-to-noise ratio and full width at half maximum values in conebeam CT images of intracranial stent struts. In the clinical subjects, we assessed contrast-to-noise ratio, full width at half maximum, and dose-area product. RESULT(S): In the phantom study, the contrast-to-noise ratio was not considerably different between 10- and 20-second acquisition times at equivalent binning settings. Additionally, the contrast-to-noise ratio at equivalent acquisition times did not differ considerably by binning setting. For the full width at half maximum results, equivalent acquisition times differed significantly by binning setting. In the clinical analyses, the 10-second/1 < 1 group (versus 20 second/2 < 2) showed a higher contrast-to-noise ratio (P .05) and a dose-area product reduced by approximately 70% (P .05), but the difference in full width at half maximum was not significant (P<.20).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the risk factors for incident functional disability among long-term evacuees of Iitate village after Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear disaster (GEJE). We also investigated the effectiveness of exercise classes as an intervention measure in this situation.METHODS: 1159 subjects (75.2 +/- 5.8 years, 57.5% female) were included at baseline, and followed-up for four years. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of incident functional disability according to the presence of risk factors evaluated by the municipality&rsquo;s self-assessment Basic Checklist (BCL). Evacuees from Iitate who participated in the exercise classes and those who did not were matched using the propensity scores, which were then used to obtain the HR of incident functional disability.RESULTS: New functional disability occurred in 280 (24.2%) participants during the follow-up. Participants who scored negative for the &ldquo;Physical function&rdquo; domain in the BCL had a HR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.54-2.69) for incident functional disability when compared to those who scored positive for this domain. Similarly, the HR for &ldquo;Cognitive function&rdquo; was 1.37 (CI: 1.06-1.77), and 1.60 (CI: 1.24-2.08) for &ldquo;Depression&rdquo;.

2273,"State-dependent bidirectional modification of somatic inhibition in neocortical pyramidal cells. Cortical pyramidal neurons alter their responses to input signals depending on behavioral state. We investigated whether changes in somatic inhibition contribute to these alterations. In layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat visual cortex, repetitive firing from a depolarized membrane potential, which typically occurs during arousal, produced long-lasting depression of somatic inhibition. In contrast, slow membrane oscillations with firing in the depolarized phase, which typically occurs during slow-wave sleep, produced long-lasting potentiation. The depression is mediated by L-type Ca2+ channels and GABA(A) receptor endocytosis, whereas potentiation is mediated by R-type Ca2+ channels and receptor exocytosis. It is likely that the direction of modification is mainly dependent on the ratio of R- and L-type Ca2+ channel activation. Furthermore, somatic inhibition was stronger in slices prepared from rats during slow-wave sleep than arousal. This bidirectional modification of somatic inhibition may alter pyramidal neuron responsiveness in accordance with behavioral state.",Excluded

Integrins are expressed in tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells. Cilengitide is the first integrin inhibitor in clinical Phase III trial for glioblastoma. However, the effects of Cilengitide on these processes have not been sufficiently examined. In this study, we investigated the anti-glioma effect of Cilengitide using DNA microarray analysis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: U87DEGFR cells (human malignant glioma cell line) were used for this experiment. The cells were harvested after 16 h of Cilengitide treatment, and mRNA was extracted. Gene expression analysis, gene ontology analysis, and pathway analysis were performed using a DNA microarray (CodeLink TM Human Whole Genome Bioarray).We validated the dysregulated genes with Q-PCR analysis and Western blotting. RESULT(S): The expression of 265 genes was changed with Cilengitide treatment. The expression of 214 genes was up-regulated by more than 4-fold and the expression of 51 genes was down-regulated by more than 4-fold compared to the controls. In gene ontology analysis, genes that were associated with ""activation of pro-apoptotic gene products"" were over-represented, and genes that were associated with ""negative regulation of neuron apoptosis"" were over-represented.

2276,"Dynamics of Ca(2+) and Na(+) in the dendrites of mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells evoked by parallel fibre stimulation. Ca2+ and Na+ play important roles in neurons, such as in synaptic plasticity. Their concentrations in neurons change dynamically in response to synaptic inputs, but their kinetics have not been compared directly. Here, we show the mechanisms and dynamics of Ca2+ and Na+ transients by simultaneous monitoring in Purkinje cell dendrites in mouse cerebellar slices. High frequency parallel fibre stimulation (50 Hz, 3-50-times) depolarized Purkinje cells, and Ca2+ transients were observed at the anatomically expected sites. The magnitude of the Ca2+ transients increased linearly with increasing numbers of parallel fibre inputs. With 50 stimuli, Ca2+ transients lasted for seconds, and the peak [Ca2+] reached approximately 100 microm, which was much higher than that reported previously, although it was still confined to a part of the dendrite. In contrast, Na+ transients were sustained for tens of seconds and diffused away from the stimulated site. Pharmacological interventions revealed that Na+ influx through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and Ca2+ influx through P-type Ca channels were essential players, that AMPA receptors did not operate as a Ca2+ influx pathway and that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through inositol trisphosphate receptors or ryanodine receptors did not contribute greatly to the large Ca2+ transients.",Excluded

The patient had a history of superficial malignant melanoma to the left axilla, which was treated with axillary dissection 13 years ago. Sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time was negative and the patient did not receive any further chemotherapy or radiation. She was monitored for 5 years with serial PET scans every 6 months along with chest Xrays, routine blood work and annual skin exams without evidence of disease recurrence. On this presentation, the patient had multiple episodes of tonicclonic seizures while in the ED for which she was given Ativan, Versed and IV Keppra. The patient denied previous CNS symptoms including headache, seizures, or vision changes. Imaging of the head revealed a large hemorrhagic frontal temporal brain lesion with smaller scattered lesions concerning for metastatic disease. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a 2.2 x 1.6 cm peripancreatic tail mass. An endoscopic ultrasound was performed which showed a mass in the region of the tail of the pancreas. FNA was done with pathology positive for metastatic melanoma. Patient was referred to Oncology service for further management. IMPACT: Most pancreatic metastases occur in the first 1-3 years after treatment of the primary tumor and current guidelines recommend follow up 3-5 years thereafter. This case report raises a question about how long patient should be monitored after the successful treatment of superficial malignant melanoma. DISCUSSION: A variety of primary neoplasms metastasize to the pancreas. About 2% of pancreatic tumors are metastatic tumors. Common metastatic sites include the kidney, lung and colon. Metastasis of malignant melanoma to pancreas occurs as manifestation of widespread disease burden. Several factors influence survival in patients with primary melanoma, including specific clinical and pathological factors, histological subtype, anatomical location and lymph node involvement. Prognostic factors influencing survival in patients with malignant melanoma are largely unknown, but a longer disease free interval between the successful resection of primary malignancy and eventual development of metastasis to the pancreas has been reported to be associated with improved survival. Our patient presented 13 years following the treatment of primarymelanoma. The prognosis of metastatic malignant melanoma is poor. Studies suggest amean survival of only 6- 8 months in patients with systemic disease from melanoma. In several case series five-year survival rates are reported at less than 10%.",Excluded
2278,"Light and electron microscopic examination of pineal gland in rats exposed to constant light and constant darkness. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to examine the pineal gland of rats exposed to constant light and darkness at light and electron microscopic level.DESIGN: For this purpose 18 male Wistar rats were used. Animals were divided into three groups. Rats in group I (Control) were kept under 12 hrs light: 12 hrs dark conditions. Rats in group II were exposed to constant darkness, while rats in group III were exposed to constant light for 6 weeks. At the end of the experiment, all animals were killed by decapitation. The pineal glands of rats were removed, then processed for light and electron microscopy.RESULTS: In our study, extensive number of pinealocytes was observed in the structure of pineal gland of rats exposed to constant darkness and some of the observed pinealocytes were determined to contain double nucleoli. Furthermore, mitochondria and lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of pinealocytes were increased and rough endoplasmic reticulum sacs were enlarged in this group. Whereas, in rats those exposed to the constant light, a decrease in pinealocyte intensity was associated with increase in the connective tissue between parenchymal cells. Additionally, mitochondria and lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of cells were decreased.CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that the pinealocyte cell activity of rats exposed to constant darkness was increased but decreased in rats exposed to constant light.",Excluded
2279,"New considerations in radiation treatment planning for brain tumors: neural progenitor cell-containing niches. The purpose of this critical review is to explore the controversy regarding the relationship between radiation dose to the neural progenitor cell (NPC) niches and patient outcomes, in terms of both toxicity and tumor control. NPCs in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus are paradoxically associated with long-term neurocognitive sequelae of brain irradiation, as well as resistance to therapy and tumor recurrence. The reconciliation of these somewhat opposing functions is challenging. Current literature suggests that radiation and other treatments against the NPC in the hippocampus and the SVZ may influence patient outcome. As a result, both the SVZ and the hippocampus could have important implications on radiation treatment planning strategies, and future laboratory and clinical evaluations will be critical in designing studies to optimize treatment outcome, effectiveness, and safety.",Excluded
2280,"The effect of increasing concentrations of intracranial albumin on fluid flow rates within adjacent white matter tracts in rats. BACKGROUND: In most systemic cancers, tumor cells are passively carried by extracellular fluid flow to regional lymph nodes. However, the mechanism of glioma cell dissemination remains controversial, as the brain does not contain a lymphatic system. Because malignant brain tumors are characterized by a disrupted blood-brain-barrier that leaks albumin from blood vessels into brain parenchyma, we hypothesize that this albumin influx will pull water in osmotically and increase flow rates and glioma cell dissemination down adjacent white matter tracts. This may have implications for future radiation planning and steroid/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor dosing. METHOD(S): Our study examines flow rates in white matter tracts after intracranial administration of albumin. We mixed 0.12-6 mg bovine albumin with 20 muL of 2% Evans Blue and injected the mixture stereotactically into the right frontal lobes of 15 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley female rats at the gray-white matter junction over 80 minutes. Seven hours later, the rats were killed and their brains sectioned into 0.5 mm coronal slices and imaged to determine interstitial flow rates. RESULT(S): All animals tolerated the infusion without difficulty. The entire brain was white except at the site of injection and in ipsilateral white matter tracts, especially the external capsule. Average flow rates (mm/hour) for rats receiving 0.12 mg of albumin were 0.43 (coronal) and 0.13 (axial) and for those receiving 6 mg albumin were 0.99 (coronal) and 0.23 (axial). Positive correlation was observed between albumin dose administered and interstitial fluid flow rates (R = 0.57 coronal and 0.36 axial). CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates higher interstitial fluid flow rates in adjacent white matter tracts in response to albumininduced- edema. These observations provide insight into expected pathways for glioma dissemination that could be used to tailor radiation plans for individual patients. Furthermore, these findings provide a rationale for interventions to reduce glioma dissemination by limiting the extravasation of albumin through the blood-brain-barrier while local radiation is being administered.",Excluded

The trachea has a composite structure with individual and incomplete cartilaginous rings. Deformation of trachea through surgical process and mechanical applications induces injury of laryngotracheal mucosa (Hussain et al. 2015). Results of recent studies studying the oxidative related values in larynx cancer indicated the importance of oxidative stress. Main reactive oxygen species (ROS) are superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. Production normal level of ROS is a physiological process, because the ROS has been using for physiological functions such as killing bacteria and viruses in the body. The excessive production of ROS is scavenged by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. 900 and 1800 MHz frequencies are used in cell phones in several countries including Turkey, although 2450 MHz has been using as Wi-Fi frequency in the countries. The non-ionize cell phone and Wi-Fi frequencies induce their hazardous effects in cells including laryngeal mucosa by excessive production of ROS. Results of recent papers indicated that the antioxidant levels such as glutathione and glutathione peroxidase were decreased in the laryngeal mucosa of animals by the cell phone and Wi-Fi exposures, but oxidative stress levels were increased by the exposures (Aynali et al. 2013). In the oral presentation, I will summarize the results of recent papers on oxidative stress and antioxidants in neurons and cells including laryngeal mucosa. In conclusion, exposure to the frequencies is accompanied by increased oxidative stress, suggesting that oxidative stress is a cause of electromagnetic radiation-induced laryngotracheal pathophysiology.

One hundred ten patients with brain metastases (76 lung cancer, 11 breast cancer, 7 colorectal cancer and others) were treated with radiotherapy, and the results were retrospectively evaluated. Neurologic symptoms were improved in 66% of patients. The relationship between improvement of neurologic symptoms and several factors, including irradiation dose, primary lesion, histology, term between first treatment and recurrence, clinical symptoms and CT findings, was analyzed. There was no significant correlation between symptom relief and these factors except for the number of metastatic lesions. Four of 110 patients could survive more than 2 years after radiotherapy: one with lung cancer, one with breast cancer, one with rectum cancer and one with uterine cancer. The factors that were analyzed for symptom relief were also studied to determine their effect on the survival of lung cancer patients with brain metastases. The patients who had higher dose irradiation (50 Gy) of improvement of neurological symptoms after radiotherapy survived significantly longer than those who had 30 Gy of irradiation or no symptom relief. Multivariate analysis of these factors showed that improvement of symptoms and irradiation dose were similarly important prognostic factors, whereas the others were not correlated with survival.",Excluded

2285,"Combination of hypomorphic mutations of the Drosophila homologues of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and nucleosome assembly protein family genes disrupts morphogenesis, memory and detoxification. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor is essential for biological responses to endogenous and exogenous toxins in mammals. Its Drosophila homolog spineless plays an important role in fly morphogenesis. We have previously shown that during morphogenesis spineless genetically interacts with CG5017 gene, which encodes a nucleosome assembly factor and may affect cognitive function of the fly. We now demonstrate synergistic interactions of spineless and CG5017 in pathways controlling oxidative stress response and long-term memory formation in Drosophila melanogaster. Oxidative stress was induced by low doses of X-ray irradiation of flies carrying hypomorphic mutation of spineless, mutation of CG5017, and their combination. To determine the sensitivity of these mutants to pharmacological modifiers of the irradiation effect, we irradiated flies growing on standard medium supplemented by radiosensitizer furazidin and radioprotector serotonin. The effects of irradiation were investigated by analyzing leg and antenna morphological structures and by using real-time PCR to measure mRNA expression levels for spineless, Cyp6g1 and Gst-theta genes. We also examined long-term memory in these mutants using conditioned courtship suppression paradigm. Our results show that the interaction of spineless and CG5017 is important for regulation of morphogenesis, long-term memory formation, and detoxification during oxidative stress. Since spineless and CG5017 are evolutionary conserved, these results must be considered when evaluating the risk of combining similar mutations in other organisms, including humans.",Excluded

2289,"Effect of space flight and head-down bedrest on neuroendocrine response to metabolic stress in physically trained subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of plasma epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) responses to insulin induced hypoglycemia (ITT) 3 weeks before the space flight (SF), on the 5th day of SF, on the 2nd and 16th days after the landing in the first Slovak astronaut, and before and on the 5th day of prolonged subsequent head-down (-6 degrees) bed rest (BR) in 15 military aircraft pilots. Blood samples during the test were collected via cannula inserted into cubital vein, centrifuged in the special appliance Plasma-03, frozen in Kryogem-03, and at the end of the 8-day space flight transferred to Earth in special container for hormonal analysis. Insulin hypoglycemia was induced by i.v. administration of 0.1 IU/kg BW insulin (Actrapid HM) in bolus. Insulin administration led to a comparable hypoglycemia in pre-flight, in-flight conditions and before and after bed rest. ITT led to a pronounced increase in EPI levels and moderate increase in NE in pre-flight studies. However, an evidently reduced EPI response was found after insulin administration during SF and during BR. Thus, during the real microgravity in SF and simulated microgravity in BR, insulin-induced hypoglycemia activates the adrenomedullary system to less extent than at conditions of the Earth gravitation. Post-flight changes in EPI and NE levels did not significantly differ from those of pre-flight since SF was relatively short (8 days) and the readaptation to Earth gravitation was fast. It seems, that an increased blood flow in brain might be responsible for the reduced EPI response to insulin. Responses to ITT in physically fit subjects indicate the stimulus specificity of deconditioning effect of 5 days bed rest on stress response. Thus, the data indicate that catecholamine responses to ITT are reduced after exposure to real as well as simulated microgravity.",Excluded

2291,"Overview of results of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 3 radiolabeled somatostatin analogs. A new treatment modality for inoperable or metastasized gastroenteropancreatic tumors is the use of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs. Initial studies with high doses of [(111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)(0)]octreotide in patients with metastasized neuroendocrine tumors were encouraging, although partial remissions were uncommon. Another radiolabeled somatostatin analog that is used for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is [(90)Y-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide. Various phase 1 and phase 2 PRRT trials have been performed with this compound. Despite differences in the protocols used, complete and partial remissions in most of the studies with [(90)Y-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide were in the same ranges, 10%-30%; these ranges were higher than those obtained with [(111)In-DTPA(0)]octreotide. Treatment with the newest radiolabeled somatostatin analog, [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate, which has a higher affinity for the subtype 2 somatostatin receptor, resulted in complete or partial remissions in 30% of 76 patients. Tumor regression was positively correlated with a high level of uptake on OctreoScan imaging, a limited hepatic tumor mass, and a high Karnofsky performance score. Treatment with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs is a promising new tool in the management of patients with inoperable or metastasized neuroendocrine tumors. Symptomatic improvement may occur with all (111)In-, (90)Y-, or (177)Lu-labeled somatostatin analogs that have been used for PRRT. The results obtained with [(90)Y-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide and [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate are very encouraging in terms of tumor regression. Also, if kidney protective agents are used, the side effects of this therapy are few and mild, and the duration of the therapy response for both radiopharmaceuticals is more than 2 y.

PURPOSE: The present study was performed to investigate the effect of crocin on blue light- and white light-induced rod and cone death in primary retinal cell cultures.METHODS: Primary retinal cell cultures were prepared from primate and bovine retinas. Fifteen-day-old cultures were exposed to blue actinic light or to white fluorescent light for 24 hours. Cultures were treated by the addition of different concentrations of crocin for 24 hours before light exposure or for 8 hours after light exposure. Cultures kept in the dark were used as controls. Green nucleic acid stain assay was used to evaluate cell death. Rods and cones were immunolabeled with specific antibodies and counted. TUNEL labeling was used to detect fragmented DNA in fixed cells after light exposure.RESULTS: Primary retinal cell cultures contained a mixture of retinal cells enriched in photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and Muller cells. Twenty-four-hour exposure to blue and white light induced death in 70% to 80% of the photoreceptors in bovine and primate retinal cell cultures. Crocin protected the photoreceptors against blue light- or white light-mediated damage in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of approximately 30 microM.

The spatial, temporal and spectral resolution in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is in many cases currently not sufficient to detect submillimeter lesions or to image the dynamics of the beating heart. At present MRI systems at 1.5 T and 3 T are the standard units for clinical imaging. The use of ultrahigh magnetic fields of 7 T and higher increases the signal-to-noise ratio, which holds promise for a significant improvement of the spatial and/or temporal resolution as well as for new contrast mechanisms. With 7 T MRI, images of the brain have been acquired routinely with a spatial resolution of 0.3 mm. The theoretical improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio is often not fully realized due to B1 inhomogeneities and contrast variations. With MRI at 7 T a notable increase in spatial resolution can be achieved. Methods such as time-of-flight MR angiography and susceptibility-weighted imaging (e.g. neurofunctional MRI, fMRI) profit especially from the higher field strengths. Transmission field inhomogeneities are still a major challenge for ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI and are also a partially unsolved safety problem. The use of UHF MRI is currently limited to special applications and the expected gain of the high field must be weighed against technical limitations in both image acquisition and interpretation.",Excluded

The effects of S 24795, a newly developed partial agonist at alpha7 nAChRs, were tested on synaptic transmission and plasticity using extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked in the CA1 region by Schaffer collateral stimulation in hippocampal slices obtained from adult mice. S 24795 reduced the amplitude of the fEPSPs in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) of 127 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1.1. The reduction in amplitude of the fEPSPs started at S 24795 concentrations higher than 3muM and reached 71% of controls at 300 microM. This effect was mediated by alpha7 nAChRs since it was blocked by nAChR antagonists and was not observed in alpha7 -/- mice. This effect was probably due to a reduction in glutamate release from presynaptic terminals since it was associated with a significant increase in the paired pulse ratio. In addition, S 24795 (100 microM) significantly reduced the frequency, but not the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, recorded in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (in voltage clamp mode), further supporting a presynaptic site of action of S 24795. In addition, S 24795 at 3 microM, a concentration that did not affect basic synaptic transmission, potentiated LTP. This effect was mediated by alpha7 nAChRs since it was prevented by MLA (10 nM) and was absent in alpha7 -/- mice. Galantamine an allosteric modulator of nAChRs, at the concentrations of 0.3-3 microM, failed to potentiate LTP. In view of its powerful effect on LTP and on cognitive function, S 24795 can be considered a novel useful tool for the treatment of AD patients and other senile forms of dementia.",Excluded

Improved analgesics are needed, but therapeutic development requires an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie acute radiation-associated pain (RAP). Our preliminary data suggest that transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels on sensory neurons play important roles in RAP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of various Trp channels in acute RAP using a mouse model of oral radiation-induced mucositis. Mice underwent high dose single fraction lingual irradiation or sham irradiation. This resulted in glossitis that was most severe at 10-12 days postirradiation and resolved within 20 days. Micewere euthanized on days 1, 5, 11, 21, and 45 post-irradiation. Functional analysis of trigeminal ganglia neurons was assessed via calcium imaging; this revealed significantly increased proportions of neurons that were sensitive to capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist), histamine (TRPV4 partial agonist), or TNF-alpha (a general inflammatory marker). These changes were seen as early as 1-day post-irradiation and lasted until the 21st day. Via quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy, we documented Trpv1 overexpression in the trigeminal ganglia neurons of tongueirradiated mice on days 11 and 21. Together, these results indicate that both TRPV1 and TRPV4 are activated and upregulated, and contribute to the acute response of oral tissues to therapeutic irradiation. Thus, future studies should focus on assessing these two Trp channels as potential targets for RAP mitigation in human and animal cancer patients.",Included

2303,"Characterization of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) brain-type fatty acid binding protein (fabp7) genes reveals the fates of teleost fabp7 genes following whole genome duplications. Whole genome duplications (WGDs) are considered to have been a driving force in the generation of evolutionary diversity that is characteristic of higher eukaryotes. The ancestor of salmonids underwent two additional WGDs compared to mammals, one (3R) at the base of the teleost radiation and another (4R) in the common ancestor of extant salmonids. We have chosen the fatty acid binding protein (fabp) gene family as a model to study the fate of duplicated genes in teleosts following WGDs. As previously described for zebrafish, we identified two copies (fabp7a and fabp7b) of the brain-type fabp gene in several fish including rainbow smelt, but there was only a single transcript in northern pike, the closest relative of the salmonids, and two rather than the expected four fabp7 genes in Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout and grayling. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that a loss of the fabp7a gene occurred in the common ancestor of the northern pike and salmonids after it had diverged from the rainbow smelt, and that the 4R WGD then gave rise to the fabp7bI and fabp7bII observed in salmonids. This is supported by genetic mapping that placed the Atlantic salmon duplicated fabp7b genes on homeologous chromosomes. There was no evidence of neo-functionalization in the salmonid fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes based on dN/dS ratios and an examination of amino acid substitutions. Atlantic salmon fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes are both expressed broadly like fabp7b expression in northern pike. However, only Atlantic salmon fabp7bII, like its counterpart in northern pike and zebrafish, was expressed in the liver. A comparison of ~ 2000 bp upstream of Atlantic salmon fabp7b gene duplicates revealed an insertion of 62 bp in fabp7bI relative to fabp7bII.

Data of patients diagnosed with absent contractility were pooled from Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH (January 2006 to July 2016) and Metrohealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH (July 2014 to July 2016) and included: age, gender, associated medical conditions, surgical history, medications, and specific antibody testing. Result(s): A total of 207 patients, including 57 male individuals and 150 female individuals, with mean age of 56.1 and 60.0 years, respectively, were included. Disease distribution was as follows: SSc (diffuse or limited cutaneous) 132, overlap syndromes 7, systemic lupus erythematosus17, Sjogren syndrome 4, polymyositis 3, and dermatomyositis 3. Various other etiologies including gastroesophageal reflux disease, postradiation esophagitis, neuromuscular disorders, and surgical complications were seen in the remaining cohort. Conclusion(s): Most practitioners use the term ""absent contractility"" interchangeably with ""scleroderma esophagus""; however, only 63% of patients with absent contractility had SSc. Overall, 20% had another systemic autoimmune rheumatologic disease and 16% had a nonrheumatologic etiology for absent contractility. Therefore, alternate diagnosis must be sought in these patients. We propose an algorithm for their etiologic evaluation. Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

2306,"Analysis of the ATM protein in wild-type and ataxia telangiectasia cells. Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a human disorder that results in a number of clinical symptoms, including cerebellar degeneration and increased cancer predisposition. Recently the gene that is defective in A-T has been cloned and designated ATM. Here, we describe the production of antisera raised against the approximately 350 kDa ATM protein. Antisera specificity is confirmed by them recognising a approximately 350 kDa polypeptide in wild-type cells but not in A-T cells containing mutations that truncate ATM upstream of the antibody binding sites. We show that ATM is almost exclusively nuclear and is expressed in all cell lines and tissues analysed. However, ATM levels are not regulated in response to u.v. or ionising radiation. These data are consistent with ATM being a component of the DNA damage detection apparatus rather than being an inducible downstream effector of the DNA damage response. In addition, we analyse ATM protein expression in a variety of A-T patients. Strikingly, ATM expression is reduced drastically or absent in all patients analysed, including those predicted to express proteins that should be detected by our antisera. Thus, the A-T phenotype may result not only from mutations that disrupt functional domains of ATM, but also from mutations that destabilise the ATM mRNA or protein. Finally, we report that a group of patients displaying an intermediate A-T phenotype express low levels of apparently full-length ATM. This suggests that the ATM pathway is partially active in these individuals and that there is a correlation between levels of residual ATM expression and disease severity.",Excluded
2307,"TRESK is a key regulator of nocturnal suprachiasmatic nucleus dynamics and light adaptive responses. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a complex structure dependent upon multiple mechanisms to ensure rhythmic electrical activity that varies between day and night, to determine circadian adaptation and behaviours. SCN neurons are exposed to glutamate from multiple sources including from the retino-hypothalamic tract and from astrocytes. However, the mechanism preventing inappropriate post-synaptic glutamatergic effects is unexplored and unknown. Unexpectedly we discovered that TRESK, a calcium regulated two-pore potassium channel, plays a crucial role in this system. We propose that glutamate activates TRESK through NMDA and AMPA mediated calcium influx and calcineurin activation to then oppose further membrane depolarisation and rising intracellular calcium. Hence, in the absence of TRESK, glutamatergic activity is unregulated leading to membrane depolarisation, increased nocturnal SCN firing, inverted basal calcium levels and impaired sensitivity in light induced phase delays. Our data reveals TRESK plays an essential part in SCN regulatory mechanisms and light induced adaptive behaviours.",Excluded

We report clinical and neurophysiological characteristics of six patients (five women and one man) presenting a pure motor bilateral asymmetric proximal and distal weakness in the setting of radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma in four cases, carcinoma of the uterus in one, and cancer of the ovary in one. Motor deficit, amyotrophy, cramps, fasciculations and tendinous areflexia were confined to the lower limbs in five patients and to the upper limbs in one. No sensory or sphincter disturbance was noted. The progression of the disease was slow with sometimes secondary stabilization. In some patients, CSF showed a slight increase in protein content with no cell. Blood and MRI medullary examination were normal. Delay between radiation therapy and onset of neurological symptoms range from 6 to 24 years (mean 15). Neurophysiological findings suggest ventral roots proximal conduction blocks. We found an increase F-waves latency, a complete distal palsy contrasting with persistent muscle action potential after distal stimulation, in most of the patients; and an evidence of a conduction block between the erb point and the cervical roots using magnetic stimulation in the patient with upper limbs involvement. Mechanisms and sites of nerve radiation injury remains still unclear. These data could indicate, as it was already reported, a proximal damage involving predominantly the motor roots.",Excluded
2309,"The influence of fibroblast on the arachnoid leptomeningeal cells in vitro. OBJECTIVE: Fibroblast is pervasive in the setting of injury. Its invasion into the arachnoid tissue causes scarring, cortical adhesion of the brain, and obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow. The purpose of this study is to determine the phenotypic and physiologic effects of fibroblasts on arachnoid in culture.METHODS: We studied the effects of fibroblast on the arachnoid cell growth, motility, phenotypic changes, and transport properties. Immortalized rat (Rattus norvegicus, Sprague Dawley breed) arachnoid cells were grown with fibroblast on opposite sides of polyethylene membranes or co-cultured in plastic wells. Arachnoid cell growth rate and DNA content, morphology, transport physiology, and extracellular matriceal content were determined in the presence of normal and irradiated fibroblast cells.RESULTS: When arachnoid cells were grown in the presence of fibroblasts, mannitol permeability increased and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) decreased. Arachnoid cell growth rate also significantly decreased. When arachnoid cells were grown in close proximity (i.e. on the same monolayer) with fibroblasts, the arachnoid cells were overrun by day 2, yet when physically separated, no significant change was seen in growth. Apoptosis increased markedly in arachnoid cultures in the presence of fibroblast. Fibroblast caused arachnoid cell to exhibit avoidance behavior, and irradiated fibroblast induced arachnoidal cells to move faster and exhibited greater directional changes. Subcellular glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content was significantly altered by fibroblast.INTERPRETATION: Fibroblasts influence arachnoid cell's mannitol transport likely via soluble factors. While the arachnoid cells did not change morphologically, cell growth was influenced. Over time, the cells had profound changes in transport and motility. The immortalized arachnoid cell/fibroblast culture system provides a unique model mimicking the pathologic event of leptomeningeal scarring.",Excluded
2310,"Symptomatic hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients following radiation therapy: a retrospective study. Endocrine assessment was performed in 32 relapse-free southern Chinese patients (21 males and 11 females, aged 27-50 years at the time of assessment) 5-17 years following radiation therapy (RT) alone for early nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Initial screening was done using questionnaires emphasizing on impaired sexual function and menstrual disturbance plus measurement of serum levels of thyroxine, free thyroxine index, thyrotropic hormone, prolactin, and additionally testosterone for males only. Those showing abnormalities were subjected to detailed pituitary function tests. Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction was found in 7 female patients and only 1 male patient. A delayed TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone suggesting a hypothalamic disorder was seen in 6 of the affected female patients, and hyperprolactinaemia in also 6. None of the patients had evidence of diabetes insipidus. Hypopituitarism became symptomatic 2-5 years after RT with a mean latent interval of 3.8 years. A practical protocol for regular endocrine assessment for NPC patients after RT has been proposed. Multiple linear regression analysis of the radiotherapeutic data from the 11 female patients indicates that the likelihood of late occurrence of symptomatic hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction following RT is dependent on the TDF of the target dose to the nasopharyngeal region and the height of the upper margin of the opposed lateral facial fields above the diaphragma sellae (coefficient of multiple correlation = 0.9025). Except when the sphenoid sinus or the middle cranial fossa is involved, it is advisable to set the height of the upper margin of the lateral facial field at a level no higher than the diaphragma sellae. The hypothalamus and possibly the pituitary stalk as well may sustain permanent damage by doses of radiation within the conventional radiotherapeutic range for carcinomas.",Excluded

The patients and 19 healthy control subjects, matched with the patients for age and educational level, underwent extensive memory assessments. Seventeen patients (10 TLI-positive, 7 TLI-negative) were reassessed after an average of 28 months for progress of memory functions. The patient groups performed significantly worse on most memory tests compared with the normal subjects. Patients with memory complaints had lower scores for verbal memory than those without such complaints. The TLI-positive and TLI-negative groups did not differ significantly from each other in cognitive performance.

2312,"186Re-HEDP for metastatic bone pain in breast cancer patients. Two-thirds of patients with metastatic cancer suffer from pain. Pain originating from skeletal metastases is the most common form of cancer-related pain. Bone pain, often exacerbated by pressure or movement, limits the patient's autonomy and social life. Pain palliation with bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals has proven to be an effective treatment modality in patients with metastatic bone pain. These bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals are extremely powerful in treating scattered painful bone metastases, for which external beam radiotherapy is impossible because of the large field of irradiation. (186)Re-hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (HEDP) is a potentially useful radiopharmaceutical for this purpose, having numerous advantageous characteristics. Bone marrow toxicity is limited and reversible, which makes repetitive treatment safe. Studies have shown encouraging clinical results of palliative therapy using (186)Re-HEDP, with an overall response rate of ca. 70% in painful bone metastases. It is effective for fast palliation of painful bone metastases from various tumours and the effect tends to last longer if patients are treated early in the course of their disease. (186)Re-HEDP is at least as effective in breast cancer patients with painful bone metastases as in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. It is to be preferred to radiopharmaceuticals with a long physical half-life in this group of patients, who tend to have more extensive haematological toxicity since they have frequently been pretreated with bone marrow suppressive chemotherapy. This systemic form of radionuclide therapy is simple to administer and complements other treatment options. It has been associated with marked pain reduction, improved mobility in many patients, reduced dependence on analgesics, and improved performance status and quality of life.

In this group, 8 patients had symptoms of a stroke or transient ischemic attack, and the other 15 patients were asymptomatic. The color velocity imaging results in the symptomatic group were then compared with those in the asymptomatic group.RESULTS: The cerebral blood flow in the symptomatic group was significantly lower than that in the asymptomatic group (224.1 +/- 89.0 versus 532.5 +/- 89.0 mL/min; P = .001).CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral blood flow as measured by color velocity imaging was lower in the symptomatic group.

2314,"Mapping by laser photostimulation of connections between the thalamic reticular and ventral posterior lateral nuclei in the rat. We used laser scanning photostimulation through a focused UV laser of caged glutamate in an in vitro slice preparation through the rat's somatosensory thalamus to study topography and connectivity between the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral posterior lateral nucleus. This enabled us to focally stimulate the soma or dendrites of reticular neurons. We were thus able to confirm and extend previous observations based mainly on neuroanatomical pathway tracing techniques: the projections from the thalamic reticular nucleus to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus have precise topography. The reticular zone, which we refer to as a ""footprint,"" within which photostimulation evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in relay cells, was relatively small and oval, with the long axis being parallel to the border between the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral posterior lateral nucleus. These evoked IPSCs were large, and by using appropriate GABA antagonists, we were able to show both GABA(A) and GABA(B) components. This suggests that photostimulation strongly activated reticular neurons. Finally, we were able to activate a disynaptic relay cell-to-reticular-to- relay cell pathway by evoking IPSCs in relay cells from photostimulation of the region surrounding a recorded relay cell. This, too, suggests strong responses of relay cells, responses strong enough to evoke spiking in their postsynaptic reticular targets. The regions of photostimulation for these disynaptic responses were much larger than the above-mentioned reticular footprints, and this suggests that reticulothalamic axon arbors are less widespread than thalamoreticular arbors, that there is more convergence in thalamoreticular connections than in reticulothalamic connections, or both.",Excluded
2315,"Comparison of internal dosimetry factors for three classes of adult computational phantoms with emphasis on I-131 in the thyroid. The S values for 11 major target organs for I-131 in the thyroid were compared for three classes of adult computational human phantoms: stylized, voxel and hybrid phantoms. In addition, we compared specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) with the thyroid as a source region over a broader photon energy range than the x- and gamma-rays of I-131. The S and SAF values were calculated for the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference voxel phantoms and the University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms by using the Monte Carlo transport method, while the S and SAF values for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) stylized phantoms were obtained from earlier publications. Phantoms in our calculations were for adults of both genders. The 11 target organs and tissues that were selected for the comparison of S values are brain, breast, stomach wall, small intestine wall, colon wall, heart wall, pancreas, salivary glands, thyroid, lungs and active marrow for I-131 and thyroid as a source region. The comparisons showed, in general, an underestimation of S values reported for the stylized phantoms compared to the values based on the ICRP voxel and UF hybrid phantoms and relatively good agreement between the S values obtained for the ICRP and UF phantoms. Substantial differences were observed for some organs between the three types of phantoms. For example, the small intestine wall of ICRP male phantom and heart wall of ICRP female phantom showed up to eightfold and fourfold greater S values, respectively, compared to the reported values for the ORNL phantoms. UF male and female phantoms also showed significant differences compared to the ORNL phantom, 4.0-fold greater for the small intestine wall and 3.3-fold greater for the heart wall. In our method, we directly calculated the S values without using the SAFs as commonly done. Hence, we sought to confirm the differences observed in our S values by comparing the SAFs among the phantoms with the thyroid as a source region for selected target organs--small intestine wall, lungs, pancreas and breast--as well as illustrate differences in energy deposition across the energy range (12 photon energies from 0.01 to 4 MeV). Differences were found in the SAFs between phantoms in a similar manner as the differences observed in S values but with larger differences at lower photon energies. To investigate the differences observed in the S and SAF values, the chord length distributions (CLDs) were computed for the selected source--target pairs and compared across the phantoms. As demonstrated by the CLDs, we found that the differences between phantoms in those factors used in internal dosimetry were governed to a significant degree by inter-organ distances which are a function of organ shape as well as organ location.",Excluded

Barlow proposed that absolute visual threshold is limited by photon-like noise events in the rod photoreceptors, and he later extended the idea to explain the elevation of threshold following bright bleaching lights in terms of increased noise in the photoreceptors. Rushton, on the other hand, has proposed that the threshold elevation during dark adaptation involves changes not within the photoreceptors themselves but rather in the gain of a subsequent 'pool'. I report here measurements of outer segment current in individual rod photoreceptors which demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations occur at a greatly increased rate following bleaches of around 1%, and that these fluctuations have the form expected for random occurrences of the single photon events. This is consistent with Barlow's ideas but does not indicate whether a gain change subsequent to the receptors also occurs.",Excluded
2318,"Short and long-term evaluation of the impact of proton minibeam radiation therapy on motor, emotional and cognitive functions. Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most frequently used methods for cancer treatment. Despite remarkable advancements in RT techniquesthe treatment of radioresistant tumours (i.e. high-grade gliomas) is not yet satisfactory. Finding novel approaches less damaging for normal tissues is of utmost importance. This would make it possible to increase the dose applied to tumours, resulting in an improvement in the cure rate. Along this line, proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) is a novel strategy that allows the spatial modulation of the dose, leading to minimal damage to brain structures compared to a high dose (25 Gy in one fraction) of standard proton therapy (PT). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether pMBRT also preserves important cerebral functions. Comprehensive longitudinal behavioural studies were performed in irradiated (peak dose of 57 Gy in one fraction) and control rats to evaluate the impact of pMBRT on motor function (motor coordination, muscular tonus, and locomotor activity), emotional function (anxiety, fear, motivation, and impulsivity), and cognitive function (learning, memory, temporal processing, and decision making). The evaluations, which were conducted over a period of 10 months, showed no significant motor or emotional dysfunction in pMBRT-irradiated rats compared with control animals. Concerning cognitive functions, similar performance was observed between the groups, although some slight learning delays might be present in some of the tests in the long term after irradiation. This study shows the minimal impact of pMBRT on the normal brain at the functional level.",Included
2319,"Ketamine pre-treatment dissociates the effects of electroconvulsive stimulation on mossy fibre sprouting and cellular proliferation in the dentate gyrus. Electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), the experimental analogue of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), has been shown to produce both functional and structural effects in the hippocampal formation in infrahuman species. These changes may relate to the antidepressant and cognitive effects of ECT observed in patients treated for severe depressive disorders. Recent studies have described both enhanced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and sprouting of mossy fibre projections from granule cells. The behavioural significance of these effects remains uncertain. In this study, we examined whether ketamine, a clinically available non-competitive NMDA receptor channel blocker, could block both of these ""trophic"" effects. Rats were given a course of eight spaced ECS or sham treatments under either halothane or ketamine anaesthesia. The thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine was administered to assess the degree of hippocampal cell proliferation and mossy fibre sprouting was quantified using the Timm staining method. Pre-treatment with ketamine dissociated these effects such that mossy fibre sprouting was attenuated significantly, while cell proliferation was unaffected. This dissociation may prove useful in determining the behavioural significance of these hippocampal changes, if any, for either the antidepressant or cognitive consequences of ECT.",Excluded

Introduction: Parkinson disease (PD), pure autonomic failure (PAF), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are characterized by intra-cerebral deposition of the protein alpha-synuclein and are termed synucleinopathies. Lewy body synucleinopathies involve decreased cardiac sympathetic innervation and functional abnormalities in residual noradrenergic terminals. This observational, retrospective, cohort study describes long-term trends in indices of cardiac sympathetic innervation and function in synucleinopathies. Method(s): Patients with PD (N = 31), PAF (N = 9), or MSA (N = 9) underwent repeated <sup>18</sup>F-dopamine positron emission tomography (median follow-up 3.5 years). Interventricular septal <sup>18</sup>F-dopamine-derived radioactivity 8 min after tracer injection (8' Radioactivity) was used as an index of sympathetic innervation and the slope of mono-exponential decline of radioactivity between 8 and 25 min (k<inf>8'-25'</inf>) as an index of intraneuronal vesicular storage. Healthy volunteers (HVs) (N = 33) and individuals at high risk of PD (N = 15) were controls. Result(s): Upon initial evaluation the groups with PD and orthostatic hypotension (OH), PAF, or PD and no OH had low mean 8' Radioactivity compared to HVs (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0002, p = 0.006) and had elevated k<inf>8'-25'</inf> (p = 0.0007, p = 0.007, p = 0.06). There was no significant difference between MSA and HVs. In PD 8' Radioactivity decreased by a median of 4% per year and did not decrease in MSA. k<inf>8'-25'</inf> values did not change during follow-up in any group. Conclusion(s): Neuroimaging evidence of decreased vesicular uptake in cardiac sympathetic nerves is present upon initial evaluation of patients with Lewy body synucleinopathies and may provide a biomarker of catecholaminergic dysfunction early in the disease process.

2323,"Proposed mechanism for reduced jugular vein flow in microgravity. Internal jugular flow is reduced in space compared with supine values, which can be associated with internal jugular vein (IJV) thrombosis. The mechanism is unknown but important to understand to prevent potentially serious vein thromboses on long duration flights. We used a novel, microgravity-focused numerical model of the cranial vascular circulation to develop hypotheses for the reduced flow. This model includes the effects of removing hydrostatic gradients and tissue compressive forces - unique effects of weightlessness. The IJV in the model incorporates sensitivity to transmural pressure across the vein, which can dramatically affect resistance and flow in the vein. The model predicts reduced IJV flow in space. Although tissue weight in the neck is reduced in weightlessness, increasing transmural pressure, this is more than offset by the reduction in venous pressure produced by the loss of hydrostatic gradients and tissue pressures throughout the body. This results in a negative transmural pressure and increased IJV resistance. Unlike the IJV, the walls of the vertebral plexus are rigid; transmural pressure does not affect its resistance and so its flow increases in microgravity. This overall result is supported by spaceflight measurements, showing reduced IJV area inflight compared with supine values preflight. Significantly, this hypothesis suggests that interventions that further decrease internal IJV pressure (such as lower body negative pressure), which are not assisted by other drainage mechanisms (e.g. gravity), might lead to stagnant flow or IJV collapse with reduced flow, which could increase rather than decrease the risk of venous thrombosis.

Purpose/Objective(s): In this study, we present our experience with robotic radiosurgical SBRT for patients with primary gynecologic malignancies who have experienced either local, regional, or distant metastases after primary treatment and for those patients where SBRT was used as a boost if brachytherapy was not possible. Materials/Methods: Patients treated with SBRT from June 2007 to November 2011 for metastases from primary gynecologic cancers (n=18) or as a boost when brachytherapy was not possible (n=3) with at least 6 months follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. The PTV included a 0.0 - 5.0 mm margin, depending on normal tissue proximity. For tumors where respiratory motion was present and bony anatomy could not be used for motion tracking, 1 to 3 gold fiducial markers were used. Extra-cranial body treatments to tumors, particularly lymph nodes, near the spine were tracked using the Xsight Spine Tracking System or, if fiducials were placed the Synchrony Tracking System was used. PET/ CT (preferred), CT or MRI imaging was used to assess local control after SBRT. Result(s): Twenty-one patients with 28 tumors received a median SBRT dose of 30 Gy (range, 12-60 Gy) delivered in a median of 5 fractions (range, 1-5). Median patient age was 62 years (range, 46-86 years). Primary tumor sites were cervical (42%), uterine (54%), and ovarian (4%). Tumor locations were 32% paraortic (PA), 11% pelvic sidewall (PS) and 11% central pelvic (CP) or 46% distant (DM). Distant metastases included bone (n=5), lymph nodes-not PA (n=4), lung (n=2) and brain (n=2). Most (62%) patients received chemotherapy prior to SBRT and 50% had prior radiation to the SBRT target site, most commonly external beam radiation delivered to the pelvis or paraortic region. Sixteen (76%) of patients remain alive with a median 21 months follow-up (range, 8 to 41 months) from time of SBRT. The actuarial 2-year survival rate from SBRT is 70%. Local failures occurred in 7 tumors at a median 9 months (range, 4 to 13 months) after SBRT resulting in a 2-year actuarial local control rate of 71%. The median duration of local control was 19 months (range, 8-41). No significant difference was found in local control rates between DM, PA, PS and CP tumors (p=0.6). Toxicities were limited with only 1 grade 3 (proctitis). Conclusion(s): Robotic radiosurgical SBRT is an attractive radiation option for gynecologic malignancies with limited metastatic disease, paraortic or pelvic recurrence.

2329,"Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation over the human motor cortex on corticospinal and transcallosal excitability. Weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can induce long lasting changes in cortical excitability. In the present study we asked whether tDCS applied to the left primary motor cortex (M1) also produces aftereffects distant from the site of the stimulating electrodes. We therefore tested corticospinal excitability in the left and the right M1 and transcallosal excitability between the two cortices using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after applying tDCS. Eight healthy subjects received 10 min of anodal or cathodal tDCS (1 mA) to the left M1. We examined the amplitude of contralateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and the onset latency and duration of transcallosal inhibition with single pulse TMS. MEPs evoked from the tDCS stimulated (left) M1 were increased by 32% after anodal and decreased by 27% after cathodal tDCS, while transcallosal inhibition evoked from the left M1 remained unchanged. The effect on MEPs evoked from the left M1 lasted longer for cathodal than for anodal tDCS. MEPs evoked from the right M1 were unchanged whilst the duration of transcallosal inhibition evoked from the right M1 was shortened after cathodal tDCS and prolonged after anodal tDCS. The duration of transcallosal inhibition returned to control values before the effect on the MEPs from the left M1 had recovered. These findings are compatible with the idea that tDCS-induced aftereffects in the cortical motor system are limited to the stimulated hemisphere, and that tDCS not only affects corticospinal circuits involved in producing MEPs but also inhibitory interneurons mediating transcallosal inhibition from the contralateral hemisphere.",Excluded

Current treatment options include whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, and chemotherapy. Corticosteroids and antiepileptic medications are commonly used for palliation of mass effect and seizures, respectively. The overall median survival is only 4 months after WBRT. Combined-modality strategies of WBRT with either chemotherapy or novel anticancer agents are under clinical investigation. Promising results have been obtained with several experimental agents and confirmatory phase III trials are underway. Although improvement in overall survival has not been seen universally, reduction in death due to progression of brain metastases and prolongation of the time to neurologic and neurocognitive progression have been reported in selected series. On the basis of these findings, it might be possible to identify new agents that may enhance the efficacy of WBRT.",Excluded
2332,"Update in facial nerve paralysis: Tissue engineering and new technologies. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present the recent advances in the treatment of facial paralysis, emphasizing the emerging technologies. This review will summarize the current state of the art in the management of facial paralysis and discuss the advances in nerve regeneration, facial reanimation, and use of novel biomaterials. This review includes surgical innovations in reinnervation and reanimation as well as progress with bioelectrical interfaces. RECENT FINDINGS: The last decade has witnessed major advances in the understanding of nerve injury and approaches for management. Key innovations include strategies to accelerate nerve regeneration, provide tissue-engineered constructs that may replace nonfunctional nerves, approaches to influence axonal guidance, limiting of donor-site morbidity, and optimization of functional outcomes. Approaches to muscle transfer continue to evolve, and new technologies allow for electrical nerve stimulation and use of artificial tissues. SUMMARY: The fields of biomedical engineering and facial reanimation increasingly intersect, with innovative surgical approaches complementing a growing array of tissue engineering tools. The goal of treatment remains the predictable restoration of natural facial movement, with acceptable morbidity and long-term stability. Advances in bioelectrical interfaces and nanotechnology hold promise for widening the window for successful treatment intervention and for restoring both lost neural inputs and muscle function.

Photon or near-infrared light therapy (NILT) may be an effective neuroprotective method to reduce behavioral dysfunction following an acute ischemic stroke. We evaluated the effects of continuous wave (CW) or pulse wave (P) NILT administered transcranially either 6 or 12 h following embolization, on behavioral outcome. For the studies, we used the rabbit small clot embolic stroke model (RSCEM) using three different treatment regimens: 1) CW power density of 7.5 mW/cm(2); 2) P1 using a frequency of 300 mus pulse at 1 kHz or 3) P2 using a frequency of 2 ms pulse at 100 Hz. Behavioral analysis was conducted 48 h after embolization, allowing for the determination of the effective stroke dose (P(50)) or clot amount (mg) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits. Using the RSCEM, a treatment is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the P(50) compared with the control group. Quantal dose-response analysis showed that the control group P(50) value was 1.01+/-0.25 mg (n=31). NILT initiated 6 h following embolization resulted in the following P(50) values: (CW) 2.06+/-0.59 mg (n=29, P=0.099); (P1) 1.89+/-0.29 mg (n=25, P=0.0248) and (P2) 1.92+/-0.15 mg (n=33, P=0.0024). NILT started 12 h following embolization resulted in the following P(50) values: (CW) 2.89+/-1.76 mg (n=29, P=0.279); (P1) 2.40+/-0.99 mg (n=24, P=0.134). At the 6-h post-embolization treatment time, there was a statistically significant increase in P(50) values compared with control for both pulse P1 and P2 modes, but not the CW mode. At the 12-h post-embolization treatment time, neither the CW nor the P1 regimens resulted in statistically significant effect, although there was a trend for an improvement. The results show that P mode NILT can result in significant clinical improvement when administered 6 h following embolic strokes in rabbits and should be considered for clinical development.",Excluded

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either PCI (100 patients) or no PCI (111 patients). Each centre was allowed to use its own PCI protocol as long as the total dose was within the range of 24-30 Gy and delivered in less than 3 weeks with fractions of 3 Gy or less. The mean follow-up is 5 years. The survival curves do not differ significantly (P=0.25) between the two groups. The 4-year overall survival rate (95% confidence interval) is 22% [15-32%] in the PCI group versus 16% [10-25%] in the control group. The relative risk of death in the PCI group compared to the control group is 0.84 (95% CI=[0.62-1.13]). The incidence of brain metastasis is lower in the PCI group, but the difference is not statistically significant (P=0.14). The 4-year cumulative rate of brain metastasis is 44% [32-57%] in the PCI group compared to 51% [38-63%] in the control group.

Purpose/Objective(s): Evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of SRT in combination with hepatic resection of primary and metastatic liver tumors. Materials/Methods: Sixteen patients completed hepatectomy and SRT for either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (6) or metastases from colorectal (5), neuroendocrine (2), uterine (2), or sarcoma (1) primary. Twenty-one operable metastases were resected in 5 patients and gold fiducials were placed into the unresectable lesions to facilitate definitive SRT. Three patients with initially unresectable tumors received preoperative SRT followed by R0 resection. SRT as a bridge to liver transplant was used in 4 patients with HCC. Four patients had salvage SRT for recurrence after surgery. All patients completed 4D-CT and 3DSPECT/ CT to define functional normal liver volume (NLV) for SRT planning. MV-fluoro was performed to confirm tumor/fiducial respiratory motion within the PTV. In retrospect, our patient's treatment planning, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were reviewed under an IRB approved outcomes study. Toxicity was graded according to CTCAE v3.0. Result(s): All patients successfully completed a combination of hepatectomy and SRT. Forty lesions were treated with hepatectomy and 20 (<= 3 per patient) received SRT with a mean PTV of 132.6 cc (range, - 9.7- 803.5). The mean dose was 47.7 Gy (range, - 36-60) prescribed to the PTV in 5-16 fractions. With median follow-up of 17.7 months (range, - 5.8-32.1), 2 patients had grade 3 elevation of Total Bilirubin prior to initiation of SRT which persisted through treatment. No incidence of > grade 1 radiation-induced liver disease was observed. The most common clinical toxicity was Grade <= 2 fatigue. No patients had grade > 2 clinical toxicity. As a group, functional NLVs defined on 3D-SPECT/CT were significantly reduced compared to liver volumes defined on CT and estimated from the Body Surface Area equation (p = 0.037 and p = 0.0012 respectively). Postoperative morbidity was <= Grade 1. On followup imaging, no in-field failures have occurred. A total of 18.7% of the patients have had a failure elsewhere in the liver. Overall survival was 75% with 4 deaths, 2 of which were from liver failure and 2 from progressive systemic disease. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary study indicates that combination of liver SRT with hepatic resection is safe and effective. It can be used preoperatively to increase resectability or postoperatively to salvage surgical failures. It can also be used to target unresectable metastases in combination with limited hepatectomies for resectable peripheral lesions thereby expanding indications for curative treatment.

Introduction: Detailed prospective studies are scarce on gamma knife treatment for arteriovenous malformations (AVM) or cavernous angioma (CA) regarding epilepsy outcome. The objective of this study is to further investigate prospectively the effect of gamma knife on seizures and expand our knowledge to other aspects of epilepsy management: medication, cognition and quality of life. Method(s): We included prospectively 9 consecutive patients (4 AVM and 5 CA) who underwent radiosurgery for epilepsy caused by vascular malformation at the CHUS between August 2004 and August 2009. The mean marginal radiation dose was 20 Gy. The objective of this study is to determinate the seizure outcome after radiosurgery. Patients were followed every 3 months to evaluate seizure count over time, Engel score and medication status. Quality of life (QOLIE 89) and neuropsychological evaluation were completed before the treatment and at 12 and 24 months following the intervention. Result(s): Patients were followed for a mean period of 39 months (range from 15 to 72 months). Three patients have been seizure free for 1 year (33%). Overall 5 patients (55%) had significant improvement with an Engel score of 1 (completely seizure free or non disabling simple partial seizure only). Medication status did not change over time. The QOLIE 89 score improved by more than 25 points (on a 100 points scale) in 3 patients (43%), 2 patients (29%) reported no change and 2 patients had lower scores. Neuropsychological testing did not show any deterioration in cognition following the intervention. No adverse reaction occurred so far. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery has some efficacy for the treatment of epilepsy associated with vascular malformations and improves quality of life in a majority of patients. It seems less effective than surgical lesionectomy. No cognitive or physical morbidity was observed. This treatment could be a useful alternative for vascular lesions in eloquent areas that cannot be safely removed with microsurgery.",Excluded

This study shows that in prenatal mice brains the repair capacity for 8-oxoG is 5-10-fold higher than in adult mice brains. Western blot analysis and repair activity in extracts from Ogg1(-/-) mice revealed that OGG1 was responsible for the efficient 8-oxoG removal from prenatal mice. To investigate how OGG1 protects against oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis, pregnant Big Blue/wild-type and Big Blue/Ogg1(-/-) mice were exposed to nontoxic doses of gamma radiation. A 2.5-fold increase in the mutation frequency in Ogg1(-/-) mouse brains was obtained by exposure to 3.5 Gy at day 19 postfertilization. This was largely due to GC to TA transversions, believed to originate from 8-oxoG mispairing with A during replication. Furthermore, rapid cell divisions seemed to be required for fixation of mutations, as a similar dose of radiation did not increase the mutation frequency, or the frequency of GC to TA transversion, in the adult brain.",Excluded

One hundred and five operators of the control unit of the Kursk nuclear power station (NPS) have been studied: 45 people after the shift (main group) and 60 - in the day off. The shift was found to exert a significant influence on the functional state of the nervous system promoting the development or aggravation of autonomous dysfunction. In some cases, it causes an elevation of blood pressure to the level of risk for cerebral vascular disease. The effect of shift on the cerebral bioelectric activity of NPS operators manifests itself in the decrease of percentage of unchanged EEG, increase of alpha-rhythm spectral power density in the parietal leads and theta-rhythm in the posterior temporal and parietal leads. These changes may be caused by weariness as well as the effects of adverse factors the operators were exposed to at the NPS.

An improved understanding of tumor biology, the ability to target tumor drivers, and the ability to harness the immune system have dramatically improved the expected survival of patients diagnosed with cancer. However, many patients continue to develop spine metastases that require local treatment with radiotherapy and surgery. Fortunately, the evolution of radiation delivery and operative techniques permits durable tumor control with a decreased risk of treatment-related toxicity and a greater emphasis on restoration of quality of life and daily function. Stereotactic body radiotherapy allows delivery of ablative radiation doses to the majority of spine tumors, reducing the need for surgery. Among patients who still require surgery for decompression of the spinal cord or spinal column stabilization, minimal access approaches and targeted tumor excision and ablation techniques minimize the surgical risk and facilitate postoperative recovery. Growing interdisciplinary collaboration among scientists and clinicians will further elucidate the synergistic possibilities among systemic, radiation, and surgical interventions for patients with spinal tumors and will bring many closer to curative therapies.

2354,"The distribution of thirteen GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain. III. Embryonic and postnatal development. The embryonic and postnatal expression of 13 GABAA receptor subunit genes in the rat CNS was studied by in situ hybridization. Each transcript exhibited a unique regional and temporal developmental expression profile. For example, in both embryonic and early postnatal cortex and thalamus, expression of the alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and beta 3 mRNAs was pronounced. In particular, the alpha 5 gene expression underwent a prominent peak in early brain. Subsequently, the thalamocortical expression of these four genes substantially diminished and was superseded in the adult by the alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, and delta subunit mRNAs. Similarly, gamma 1 and gamma 3 gene expression also dropped markedly during development, their initial stronger expression being restricted to relatively few structures. In contrast, gamma 2 gene expression was widespread and mostly remained constant with increasing age. The medial septum and globus pallidus were regions expressing few subunits in both early postnatal and adult stages, allowing clear developmental combinatorial changes to be inferred (alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 2/alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 1 to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 1/gamma 2, respectively). In contrast, cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibited no developmental switch, expressing only the alpha 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs from birth to adult. Certain GABAA transcripts were also detected in germinal zones (e.g., beta 1, beta 3, gamma 1) and in embryonic peripheral tissues such as dorsal root ganglia (e.g., alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 3, gamma 2) and intestine (gamma 3). Some parallels in regional and temporal CNS expression were noted (e.g., alpha 1 beta 2, alpha 2 beta 3, alpha 4/alpha 6 delta), whereas the alpha 5 and beta 1 regional mRNA expressions converted over time. The changes of GABAA receptor subunit gene expression suggest a molecular explanation for earlier observations on changing ligand binding affinities. Thus, the composition, and presumably properties, of embryonic/early postnatal rat GABAA receptors differs markedly from those expressed in the adult brain.",Excluded

Two cases of PRC had complete relief of symptoms 24-48 h after surgery and are symptom-free 2 and 3 years later. One case of recurrent OO after surgery and treated with PRC with a reduced dose improved only, and still requires anti-inflammatory drugs 2 years after the procedure. Our still limited experience suggests that PRC can be safely performed in local anaesthesia with the patient awake, enabling to check for signs and symptoms of possible neurological injury. PRC can substitute extensive posterior approaches and reconstructions for OO of the posterior arch and joint pillar. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

2357,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for metastatic melanoma: An analysis of survival, outcome, and complications. OBJECTIVE: Although the mainstays for treatment of metastatic brain disease have been surgery and/or external beam radiation therapy, an increasing number of patients are being referred for stereotactic radiosurgery as the primary intervention for their intracranial pathological abnormalities. The lack of efficacy and cognitive and behavioral consequences of whole brain irradiation have prompted clinicians to select patients for alternative therapies. This study analyzes the effectiveness of Leksell gamma unit therapy for metastatic melanoma to the brain. METHOD(S): We present our experience with 59 Leksell gamma unit treatment sessions in 45 consecutive patients who presented with metastatic melanoma to the brain. Five of these procedures were performed as salvage therapy for patients who needed second radiosurgical treatment for new lesions that were remote from the previous targets and were not included in the overall analyses. RESULT(S): The population included 78% male patients. The mean patient age was 53 years (age range, 24-80 yr). The mean time from diagnosis of primary melanoma to discovery of brain metastasis was 43 months (median, 27.5 mo; range, 1-180 mo). At the time of diagnosis of brain disease, 35.5% of the patients (16 of 45 patients) had neurological symptoms, 77.7% (35 of 45 patients) had known visceral metastases, and 11.1% (5 of 45 patients) had seizure disorders. Eighty-six percent of the lesions (80 of 93 lesions) were cortical, 12% (11 of 93 lesions) were cerebellar, 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were pontine, and 1% (1 of 93 lesions) were thalamic. Fifty-seven percent of the sessions (31 of 54 sessions) were performed for a single lesion, 24.1% (13 of 54 sessions) for two lesions, 9.2% (5 of 54 sessions) for three lesions, 7.4% (4 of 54 sessions) for four lesions, and 1.8% (1 of 54 sessions) for five lesions. The mean treatment volume was 5.6 cc, with a mean prescription of 21.6 Gy to the 56.0% mean isodose line. The median survival time of the patients in our population, using Kaplan-Meier curves, was 43 months from the time of diagnosis of primary melanoma (range, 3-180 mo) and 8 months (range, 1-20 mo) from the time of gamma knife treatment. Complications included seizures within 24 hours of the procedure in four patients, with transient nausea and vomiting in three patients, transient worsening of preprocedure paresis responsive to steroids in three patients, and increased confusion in one patient. All 45 patients were located for follow-up (mean follow-up duration, 1 yr). After gamma knife treatment, 78% of the patients (35 of 45 patients) experienced either improved or stable neurological symptomatology before death or at the time of the latest follow-up examination. There were 26 deaths (58%). The cause of death was determined to be neurological in only 2 of 45 patients (7.7%). Follow-up magnetic resonance images revealed a 97% local tumor control rate of gamma knife-treated lesions, with 28% radiographic disappearance (9 of 32 cases). Six patients developed new lesions remote from radiosurgical targets and underwent second procedures. CONCLUSION(S): Although metastatic melanoma to the brain continues to have a foreboding prognosis for long-term survival, gamma knife radiosurgery seems to be a relatively safe, noninvasive, palliative therapy, halting or reversing neurological progression in 77.8% of treated patients (35 of 45 patients). The survival rate matches or exceeds those previously reported for surgery and other forms of radiotherapy. Only 7.7% of the patients in our study population who died as a result of metastatic melanoma (2 of 26 patients) died as a result of neurological disease. The routine use of therapeutic level antiseizure medication is emphasized, considering the findings of our review.",Excluded

2359,"Unusual presentation of small cell lung cancer as a pulmonary tumour diagnosed after VATS pneumonectomy. Introduction: Intravascular tumours of the pulmonary arteries are an exceedingly rare presentation for primary pulmonary neoplasia. Even rarer still are the subset of small cell lung cancers arising within the pulmonary artery. The prognostic significance of intravascular invasion into the pulmonary artery by lung cancer in the absence of metastatic is unclear but generally believed to be ominous. Method(s): We describe the case of a 64 year-old female diagnosed with Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome who was subsequently found to have left pulmonary artery tumour. Decision was made to move to VATS pneumonectomy due to the usually grim prognosis of related to nonoperative management of the more common pulmonary artery sarcomas, and anatomical limitations for safe biopsy of the pulmonary artery. Unexpectedly histopathology revealed limited stage small cell lung cancer. We present this case to highlight problems encountered in diagnosing pulmonary artery tumours, the VATS approach to intrapericardial pneumonectomy and ultimately, the surgical and histopathological findings for a very rare presentation. Result(s): She had an uncomplicated post-operative course and discharged from hospital with planned chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial radiation. Discussion(s): To date there have been 2 case reports in the literature describing isolated small cell lung cancer and a 3 rd case describing undifferentiated malignant neoplasia arising fromthe pulmonary artery.We believe this is the only case of resection of small cell lung cancer localized to the pulmonary artery that we plan to follow up long term.",Excluded

Removal of mechanical loading (spaceflight, bedrest, casting) causes rapid atrophy of affected skeletal muscles. Recently, we identified that translocation of the mu-splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSmu) and downstream activation of FoxO3a were redox-sensitive phenomena. Prospective sources or reactive oxygen species (ROS) include mitochondria and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2). We tested the causal role of Nox2 in unloading induced atrophy using a peptidyl inhibitor (gp91ds-tat) with the following groups: ambulatory controls (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 7 days with scrambled sequence (HUScr), and unloading for 7 days + 5 mg/kg/day gp91dsTAT (HUG). Nox2 inhibition provided significant against HU-induced reduction of plantarflexor muscle mass and soleus muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), measured using ImageJ and SMASH programs. There was a trend towards protection against a partial shift in fiber-type shift from slow to fast twitch. Loss of sarcolemmal nNOSmu activity with HU, visualized using NADPH diaphorase and confirmed with immunofluorescence were also mitigated by gp91dsTAT. Gp91dsTAT also attenuated membrane localization of the Nox2 subunit p67phox. We conclude that Nox2 inhibition protects against muscle fiber atrophy and translocation of nNOSmu.",Excluded
2361,"Effect of gravity and microgravity on intracranial pressure. KEY POINTS: Astronauts have recently been discovered to have impaired vision, with a presentation that resembles syndromes of elevated intracranial pressure on Earth. Gravity has a profound effect on fluid distribution and pressure within the human circulation. In contrast to prevailing theory, we observed that microgravity reduces central venous and intracranial pressure. This being said, intracranial pressure is not reduced to the levels observed in the 90 deg seated upright posture on Earth. Thus, over 24 h in zero gravity, pressure in the brain is slightly above that observed on Earth, which may explain remodelling of the eye in astronauts.ABSTRACT: Astronauts have recently been discovered to have impaired vision, with a presentation that resembles syndromes of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). This syndrome is considered the most mission-critical medical problem identified in the past decade of manned spaceflight. We recruited five men and three women who had an Ommaya reservoir inserted for the delivery of prophylactic CNS chemotherapy, but were free of their malignant disease for at least 1 year. ICP was assessed by placing a fluid-filled 25 gauge butterfly needle into the Ommaya reservoir. Subjects were studied in the upright and supine position, during acute zero gravity (parabolic flight) and prolonged simulated microgravity (6 deg head-down tilt bedrest). ICP was lower when seated in the 90 deg upright posture compared to lying supine (seated, 4 +/- 1 vs. supine, 15 +/- 2 mmHg). Whilst lying in the supine posture, central venous pressure (supine, 7 +/- 3 vs. microgravity, 4 +/- 2 mmHg) and ICP (supine, 17 +/- 2 vs. microgravity, 13 +/- 2 mmHg) were reduced in acute zero gravity, although not to the levels observed in the 90 deg seated upright posture on Earth. Prolonged periods of simulated microgravity did not cause progressive elevations in ICP (supine, 15 +/- 2 vs. 24 h head-down tilt, 15 +/- 4 mmHg). Complete removal of gravity does not pathologically elevate ICP but does prevent the normal lowering of ICP when upright. These findings suggest the human brain is protected by the daily circadian cycles in regional ICPs, without which pathology may occur.",Excluded
2362,"Celiac plexus radiosurgery: A new palliative modality for upper gastrointestinal malignancies-Final results of a proof-ofconcept clinical trial. Background: Many patients with upper-abdominal malignancies suffer from severe lower back pain radiating to the epigastrium, caused by infiltration of the celiac plexus. The celiac plexus is a network of nociceptive nerves, located along the aorta. Contemporary approaches (opioids, celiac plexus chemical neurolysis, systemic chemotherapy) are often inadequate. The celiac plexus has not previously been targeted using radiation. We hypothesized that ablative radiation targeted to the celiac plexus would alleviate pain. Method(s): We conducted a single arm prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients had celiac-pain > 4/10 on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), ECOG <= 3, no previous abdominal RT, and were evaluable if they completed treatment per protocol with at least one post-treatment visit. The celiac plexus was irradiated from D12 to L2. Radiation was given as either five fractions of 9 Gy or a single-fraction 25 Gy. The primary endpoint was NRS pain 3 weeks post-treatment. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, pain at 6w, analgesic use, and pain interference with daily activities as evaluated by 'Brief Pain Inventory' before and after radiation. Result(s): 21 patients were evaluable: 2 received fractionated treatment, 19 received 25Gy single fraction. The median age of the study population was 63 yr with a median ECOG of 1, 86% had pancreatic cancer. Patients were a median of 8 months out from diagnosis, and had received a median of one systemic treatment. Toxicity was limited to grade 1-2. All patients reported decreased celiac pain: median baseline pain was 6/10 (IQR 5-7.7), was reduced to 2.3/10 (IQR 0.9-3.9) (p < 0.0005) at 3w, and to 1.8/10 (IQR 0-3.2) (p < 0.0005) at 6w post-treatment. Seven patients reported their celiac pain had been eliminated entirely. Median morphine consumption decreased (NS). Improvement was seen in multiple quality of life measures, includ. total wellbeing (p = 0.0001), daily activity (p = 0.005) and sleep quality (p = 0.002). Conclusion(s): Celiac plexus radiosurgery alleviates pain, and improves quality of life among patients with advanced upper-GI cancer.

2364,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight. Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded
2365,"Diabetic levels of glucose increase cellular reducing equivalents but reduce survival in three models of 661W photoreceptor-like cell injury. BACKGROUND: The effect of excess glucose on retinal cellular health remains controversial, and cellular reducing equivalents, as indicators of cellular energy production, are widely used as substitute indicators of retinal cellular health. These investigations hypothesised that excess energy substrate availability, as occurs in the diabetic retina, increases the susceptibility of retinal neurons to injury in the presence of increased cellular reducing equivalents.METHODS: The response of 661W cells to phototoxicity, oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and apoptosis induction by staurosporine was characterised in the presence of 5mM glucose and B27 defined media without insulin. Cellular insult was produced by phototoxicity, H2O2 and the apoptosis induction agent staurosporine. The effect of physiologically relevant alterations in environmental glucose on cellular reducing equivalents was assessed by MTT dye reduction and NAD(P)H assays, and cell survival was assessed via caspase 3/7 activation and Annexin V/PI flow cytometry.RESULTS: 661W photoreceptor-like cells underwent dose dependent cell death primarily by apoptosis in response to phototoxic insult, H2O2, and staurosporine by all measures of cellular viability. Exposure of cells to 25mM glucose (diabetic-type conditions) increased cell death in response to all insults as measured by caspase 3/7 activation and Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Cellular reducing equivalents were nonetheless increased in all models of injury in the presence of excess glucose. The mechanism of this increase was partly due to increased NADPH but not NADH levels in the presence of 25mM glucose.CONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to 25mM glucose decreased the resilience of 661W photoreceptor-like cells to a range of cellular stressors whilst maintaining or increasing cellular reducing equivalents, partly be increasing NADPH levels. This shows that in 661W cells, diabetic levels of glucose decrease cellular resilience to injury. The decoupling of cellular reducing equivalents levels from cell survival has important implications when investigating the mechanisms of neuronal damage in diabetic retinal neuropathy.",Excluded

2368,"Daytime colour preference in Drosophila depends on the circadian clock and TRP channels. Light discrimination according to colour can confer survival advantages by guiding animals towards food and shelter and away from potentially harmful situations<sup>1,2</sup>. Such colour-dependent behaviour can be learned or innate. Data on innate colour preference in mammals remain controversial<sup>3</sup> and there are limited data for simpler organisms<sup>4-7</sup>. Here we show that, when given a choice among blue, green and dim light, fruit flies exhibit an unexpectedly complex pattern of colour preference that changes according to the time of day. Flies show a strong preference for green in the early morning and late afternoon, a reduced green preference at midday and a robust avoidance of blue throughout the day. Genetic manipulations reveal that the peaks in green preference require rhodopsin-based visual photoreceptors and are controlled by the circadian clock. The midday reduction in green preference in favour of dim light depends on the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels dTRPA1 and Pyrexia, and is also timed by the clock. By contrast, avoidance of blue light is primarily mediated by multidendritic neurons, requires rhodopsin 7 and the TRP channel Painless, and is independent of the clock. Our findings show that several TRP channels are involved in colour-driven behaviour in Drosophila, and reveal distinct pathways of innate colour preference that coordinate the behavioural dynamics of flies in ambient light.",Excluded

Thus, we explored changes in hippocampal volume according to the dose delivered and the location relative to the glioblastoma. Method(s): All patients were treated for glioblastoma with surgery, concomitant radiotherapy and temozolomide, and adjuvant temozolomide. Hippocampi were retrospectively delineated on three MRIs, performed at baseline, at the time of relapse, and on the last MRI available at the end of follow-up. A total of 98, 96, and 82 hippocampi were measured in the 49 patients included in the study, respectively. The patients were stratified into three subgroups according to the dose delivered to 40% of the hippocampus.

2371,"Against the motion: This house believes that hippocampus avoiding WBI is the current standard of care. Because of advances in the management of several solid tumours such as NSCLC, breast cancer, melanoma, the risk of developing brain metastases (BM) seems to increase as survival is prolonged. Their management represents a real challenge because Symptomatic BM can cause life-threatening symptoms and serious impairment of quality of life. In the last 15 years, there has been development and widespread use of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), but this concerns a subgroup of patients who have a limited number of brain lesions, for whom brain SRT and/or surgery can be proposed. This strategy provides better results than whole-brain irradiation (WBI) with median survival exceeding 12 months. WBI is still regarded as standard treatment for multiple symptomatic BM, not accessible to SRT even though a randomised trial does not seem to support the use of this approach versus best supportive care in NSCLC. There is strong concern about the toxicity of such treatment. Acute toxicity is generally manageable but long-term sequelae such as neurocognitive toxicity and ataxia, are deleterious to the quality of life of patients. There are areas of active research that hold great potential to reduce the risk of neurocognitive decline after WBI such as hippocampal-sparing radiotherapy and the use of neuroprotective agents. As neurocognitive toxicity from WBI related to damage to neural progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and hippocampus and the induction of inflammation in the brain, several studies have been performed assessing hippocampus avoiding irradiation, considering that BM in the hippocampal region seem rare (about 5%), Promising results have been reported in patients having undergone WBI to treat BM. Another challenging area is evaluating prophylactic cranial irradiation with hippocampus avoidance, with contrasting preliminary results. The cause of radiation injury to the brain is likely to be multifactorial, and reducing radiation dose to the hippocampus may not be the only way to reduce neurotoxicity. Furthermore we need more mature results to conclude that it should the new standard of care. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded

Clinically observed adverse radiation effects (ARE) are rather uncommon, but modern imaging reveals that they are more common after radiosurgery than previously believed. Little is known about the pathogenesis, and current treatment is mostly empirical. The benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) on radiation-induced bone and soft tissue necrosis is known in lesions in the maxillofacial area, the mouth and in the head and neck. HBO raises the tissue pO2 and initiates a cellular and vascular repair mechanism. This forms the basis for the hypothesis that it might also help alleviate the results of cerebral radionecrosis. This study is a preliminary attempt to test this hypothesis. Two patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were chosen for the study. They had been treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and had developed imaging signs consistent with ARE. They were treated by breathing 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (250 kPa) in sessions of 60 minutes per day. This treatment was repeated 40 times in cycles of ten sessions. Both responded well to HBO, one lesion disappeared and the other was reduced significantly in size. No adjuvant steroids were given.

In hospitalized patients, mastoid effusion increases the risks for bacterial otitis and mastoiditis. We reasoned that cephalad fluid shifts during strict -6degree head down tilt bed rest could reproduce space-flight associated mastoid effusion and that artificial gravity may reverse the response.METHODS: The recent Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study-European Space Agency study (AGBRESA) tested influences of artificial gravity during 60 days head down bed rest on a short-arm human centrifuge in healthy participants. The two intervention groups received daily artificial gravity with 30 minutes continuous artificial gravity or intermittent artificial gravity. A third group served as a control group and received no artificial gravity. We assessed cranial magnetic resonance images for mastoid effusions 1 day before bed rest, at days 14 and 52 of bed rest, and 3 days after bed rest.RESULTS: None of the participants exhibited mastoid effusions before bed rest. Six participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 14 (4 continuous, 2 intermittent, 0 control). Fifteen participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 52 and 3 days after bed rest (7 continuous, 3 intermittent, 5 control).CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid effusions commonly occur during strict head down tilt bed rest. The model can be applied to study the mechanisms and potential countermeasures for space flight-associated mastoid effusions.

Although x-ray scatter is generally regarded as a nuisance that reduces radiographic contrast (C) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in conventional images, many technologies have been devised to extract useful information from the scattered x rays. A systematic approach, however, for analyzing the potential applications of x-ray scatter imaging has been lacking. Therefore, we have formulated a simple but useful semianalytic model to investigate C and SNR in scatter images. Our model considers the imaging of a target object against a background material of the same dimensions when both are situated within a water phantom. We have selected biological materials (liver, fat, bone, muscle, blood, and brain matter) for which intermolecular form factors for coherent scattering were available. Analytic relationships between C and SNR were derived, and evaluated numerically as the target object thickness (0.01-40 mm) and photon energy (10-200 keV) were systematically varied. The fundamental limits of scatter imaging were assessed via calculations that assumed that all first-order scatter exiting the phantom, over 4pi steradians, formed the signal. Calculations for a restricted detector solid angle were then performed. For the task of imaging white brain matter versus blood in a 15 cm thick water phantom, the maximum SNR, over all energies, for images based on the detection of all forward scatter within the angular range 2degree- 12degreeis greater than that of primary images for target object thicknesses <= 23 mm. Use of the backscattered x rays within the range 158degree-178degreeto image objects 3 cm below the surface of a 25 cm thick water phantom allows the liver to be distinguished from fat with a SNR superior to that of primary imaging when the objects are <=22 mm thick.

2382,"Impact of brain metastasis velocity on neurologic death for brain metastasis patients experiencing distant brain failure after initial stereotactic radiosurgery. PURPOSE: Patients with high rates of developing new brain metastases have an increased likelihood of dying of neurologic death. It is unclear, however, whether this risk is affected by treatment choice following failure of primary stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: From July 2000 to March 2017, 440 patients with brain metastasis were treated with SRS and progressed to have a distant brain failure (DBF). Eighty-seven patients were treated within the immunotherapy era. Brain metastasis velocity (BMV) was calculated for each patient. In general, the institutional philosophy for use of salvage SRS vs whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) was to postpone the use of WBRT for as long as possible and to treat with salvage SRS when feasible. No further treatment was reserved for patients with poor life expectancy and who were not expected to benefit from salvage treatment.RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five patients were treated with repeat SRS, 91 patients were treated with salvage WBRT, and 64 patients received no salvage radiation therapy. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death after salvage SRS vs WBRT was 15% vs 23% for the low- (p = 0.06), 30% vs 37% for the intermediate- (p < 0.01), and 31% vs 48% (p < 0.01) for the high-BMV group. Salvage WBRT was associated with increased incidence of neurologic death on multivariate analysis (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.39, p = 0.01) when compared to repeat SRS. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death for patients treated within the immunotherapy era was 9%, 38%, and 38% for low-, intermediate-, and high-BMV groups, respectively (p = 0.01).CONCLUSION: Intermediate and high risk BMV groups are predictive of neurologic death.

Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery was used in an effort to maintain effective therapy while minimizing toxicity of treatment.METHODS: The authors described 38 patients with acoustic neuromas, with age range 35-89 years (mean, 60 years). 2,000 cGy in divided weekly doses of 400 or 500 cGy was most commonly prescribed. Tumors > or = 3 cm (n = 16) received the 5 fraction schema. Mean tumor volume was 6.9 cm3, with range from 0.1 to 32.0 cm3.RESULTS: Median clinical follow-up was 27.1 months, while neuroimaging follow-up had a median of 16.3 months. All tumors were controlled. Of 23 tumors smaller than 3 cm, 14 (61%) decreased in size, and 9 showed cessation of growth. Thirteen of 16 (81%) large acoustic neuromas (3-5 cm) diminished in size. The remaining 3 showed cessation of growth. Median radiographic follow-up was 20 months, with a median clinical follow-up of 28 months. No patient developed fifth nerve symptoms after treatment nor did any patient require surgery for treatment failure. Only one had temporary seventh nerve palsy.CONCLUSION: Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery offers a therapeutic approach producing high control rates while avoiding morbidity frequently seen after single-fraction radiosurgery or microsurgery.",Excluded
2384,"Patterns of care and outcomes of chemoradiation versus radiation alone for MGMT promoter unmethylated glioblastoma. OBJECTIVE: The recommended treatment for O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter unmethylated glioblastoma (GBM) is radiation therapy with concurrent/adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). However, it is well known that the clinical benefit from TMZ is lower in these patients. We sought to analyze patterns of care and outcomes of chemoradiation versus radiation alone in this cohort using a large, hospital database.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM from 2010 to 2012 who received radiation (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT) were identified in the National Cancer Database. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of receiving chemoradiation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess overall survival (OS) by treatment group and Cox regression analysis was used to assess impact of covariates on OS.RESULTS: There were 738 patients who met the study criteria, of which 107 (14.5%) received RT alone and 631 (85.5%) received CRT with median RT dose 6000cGy for both groups. Median follow up for living patients was 21.9 months. Ninety-two (12.5%) patients did not undergo any resection, 330 (44.7%) underwent a subtotal resection and 316 (42.8%) had a gross total resection. The median and 2-year OS was 16.8 months and 24.7% for RT alone compared to 15.6 months and 25.9% for the CRT group (p=0.250). On multivariable analysis, the addition of chemotherapy had no impact on survival (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86-1.46, p=0.396).CONCLUSION: Despite the routine use of chemoradiation among patients with MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM, there does not appear to be a survival benefit compared to radiation alone.",Excluded

2386,"Neural tracts injuries in patients with hypoxic ischemic brain injury: Diffusion tensor imaging study. Many studies have reported on vulnerable areas of the brain in hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HI-BI). However, little is known about the involvement of neural tracts following HI-BI. We investigated neural tract injuries in adult patients with HI-BI, using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Twelve consecutive patients with HI-BI and 12 control subjects were recruited for this study. We classified the patients into two subgroups according to the preservation of alertness: subgroup A-5 patients who had intact alertness and subgroup B-7 patients who had impaired alertness. DTI-Studio software was used for evaluation of seven neural tracts: corticospinal, cingulum, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and optic radiation. We measured the DTT parameters (fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient and voxel number) of each neural tract. In the individual analysis, all 12 patients showed injuries in all 24 neural tracts in terms of both DTT parameters and integrity, except for the corticospinal tract (75.0% injury). In the group analysis, the patient group showed neural injuries in all 24 neural tracts. In comparison of subgroups A and B, subgroup B showed more severe injuries: subgroup B showed a higher rate of disruption (39.8%) than subgroup A (12.9%) on individual DTTs and subgroup B had more severe injuries in both the cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. In conclusion, we found that extensive injuries in the neural tracts were accompanied by HI-BI. Patients with impaired alertness appeared to show more severe injuries of neural tracts. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
2387,"Human glycine alpha1 receptor inhibition by quercetin is abolished or inversed by alpha267 mutations in transmembrane domain 2. Quercetin, one of the flavonoids, is a compound of low molecular weight found in fruits and vegetables. Besides its antioxidative effect, quercetin also shows a wide range of diverse neuropharmacological actions. However, the cellular mechanisms of quercetin's actions, especially on ligand-gated ion channels and synaptic transmissions, are not well studied. We investigated the effect of quercetin on the human glycine alpha1 receptor channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Application of quercetin reversibly inhibited glycine-induced current (I(Gly)). Quercetin's inhibition depends on its dose, with an IC(50) of 21.5+/-.2 microM. The inhibition was sensitive to membrane voltages. Site-directed mutations of S267 to S267Y but not S267A, S267F, S267G, S267K, S267L and S267T at transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) nearly abolished quercetin-induced inhibition of I(Gly). In contrast, in site-directed mutant receptors such as S267 to S267I, S267R and S267V, quercetin enhanced I(Gly) compared to the wild-type receptor. The EC(50) was 22.6+/-1.4, 25.5+/-4.2, and 14.5+/-3.1 microM for S267I, S267R and S267V, respectively. These results indicate that quercetin might regulate the human glycine alpha(1) receptor via interaction with amino acid residue alpha267 and that alpha267 plays a key role in determining the regulatory consequences of the human glycine alpha1 receptor by quercetin.",Excluded
2388,"Initial Gamma Knife radiosurgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. OBJECT: Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) are the most common type of pituitary adenoma and, when symptomatic, typically require surgical removal as an initial means of management. Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an alternative therapeutic strategy for patients whose comorbidities substantially increase the risks of resection. In this report, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of initial GKRS for NFAs.METHODS: An international group of three academic Gamma Knife centers retrospectively reviewed outcome data in 569 patients with NFAs.RESULTS: Forty-one patients (7.2%) underwent GKRS as primary management for their NFAs because of an advanced age, multiple comorbidities, or patient preference. The median age at the time of radiosurgery was 69 years. Thirty-seven percent of the patients had hypopituitarism before GKRS. Patients received a median tumor margin dose of 12 Gy (range 6.2-25.0 Gy) at a median isodose of 50%. The overall tumor control rate was 92.7%, and the actuarial tumor control rate was 94% and 85% at 5 and 10 years postradiosurgery, respectively. Three patients with tumor growth or symptom progression underwent resection at 3, 3, and 96 months after GKRS, respectively. New or worsened hypopituitarism developed in 10 patients (24%) at a median interval of 37 months after GKRS. One patient suffered new-onset cranial nerve palsy. No other radiosurgical complications were noted. Delayed hypopituitarism was observed more often in patients who had received a tumor margin dose > 18 Gy (p = 0.038) and a maximum dose > 36 Gy (p = 0.025).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, GKRS resulted in long-term control of NFAs in 85% of patients at 10 years. This experience suggests that GKRS provides long-term tumor control with an acceptable risk profile. This approach may be especially valuable in older patients, those with multiple comorbidities, and those who have endocrine-inactive tumors without visual compromise due to mass effect of the adenoma.",Excluded
2389,"Increased risk of ischemic stroke in young nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. PURPOSE: Radiation/chemoradiotherapy-induced carotid stenosis and cerebrovascular events in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) can cause severe disability and even death. This study aimed to estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in this patient population over more than 10 years of follow-up.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study cohorts consisted of all patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of NPC (n=1094), whereas patients hospitalized for an appendectomy during 1997 and 1998 (n=4376) acted as the control group and surrogate for the general population. Cox proportional hazard model was performed as a means of comparing the stroke-free survival rate between the two cohorts after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors.RESULTS: Of the 292 patients with ischemic strokes, 62 (5.7%) were from the NPC cohort and 230 (5.3%) were from the control group. NPC patients ages 35-54 had a 1.66 times (95% CI, 1.16-2.86; p=0.009) higher risk of ischemic stroke after adjusting for patient characteristics, comorbidities, geographic region, urbanization level of residence, and socioeconomic status. There was no statistical difference in ischemic stroke risk between the NPC patients and appendectomy patients ages 55-64 years (hazard ratio=0.87; 95% CI, 0.56-1.33; p=0.524) after adjusting for other factors.CONCLUSIONS: Young NPC patients carry a higher risk for ischemic stroke than the general population. Besides regular examinations of carotid duplex, different irradiation strategies or using new technique of radiotherapy, such as intensity modulated radiation therapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy, should be considered in young NPC patients.",Excluded
2390,"A calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance underlies the plateau potential in rat substantia nigra GABAergic neurons. Plateau potentials can be elicited in nigral GABAergic neurons by injection of 500 ms depolarizing current pulses from hyperpolarized holding potentials in whole-cell recordings in vitro. In approximately one-third of these neurons, plateau potentials were observed under control conditions and could be elicited in the remaining neurons after blocking potassium conductances. Application of the L-type calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 or activation of NMDA receptors enhanced plateau potentials observed under control conditions and caused a plateau to be elicited in neurons not exhibiting it previously. The plateau potential was abolished in calcium-free buffer, as well as by nickel or cadmium. The L-type calcium channel blockers nimodipine and nifedipine abolished the plateau potential observed under control conditions but did not affect plateaus unmasked by tetraethylammonium. Plateau potentials observed under control conditions as well as those observed in the presence of Bay K 8644, NMDA, or tetraethylammonium were abolished in low-sodium buffer and by the calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance blocker flufenamic acid. These data suggest that nigral plateau potentials are mediated by a calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance (I(CAN)) that is activated by calcium entry predominantly through L-type calcium channels. In many nigral neurons, I(CAN) is masked by tetraethylammonium-sensitive potassium conductances, but plateaus can be evoked after increasing calcium conductances. The I(CAN)-mediated plateau potential in nigral GABAergic neurons likely affects the way these neurons integrate input and may represent a mechanism contributing to the rhythmic firing of these neurons seen in pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.",Excluded
2391,"Assessment of treatment response of concurrent pulsed radiotherapy (PRT) and temozolomide by micropet/CT in a murine orthotopic model of glioblastoma multiforme. Purpose/Objective: Glioblastomas (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors that are highly resistant to therapy. While conventional radiation therapy (RT) with temozolomide (TMZ) has improved median survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months, the majority of patients succumb to this disease due to local failure. To overcome this resistance, we evaluated the efficacy of pulsed low-dose radiotherapy (PRT) combined with TMZ as a novel treatment strategy, and evaluated efficacy using 18F-FDG muPET/CT imaging and immunohistochemistry. Materials/Methods: Intracranial tumors were established by injecting U87 GBM cells in Nu-Foxn1nu mice using a stereotactic device. Tumor burden was determined by contrast-enhanced muCT and these volumes were applied to 18F-FDG muPET data to evaluate tumor metabolic activity (SUVmax). Six treatment groups were evaluated; 1) control 2) TMZ alone 3) RT alone 4) PRT alone 5) RT+TMZ 6) PRT+TMZ. Tumors were irradiated 7-10 days post-implantation to a total dose of 14 Gy over 7 consecutive days. Radiation was delivered using either a single 2 Gy dose/day (RT) or 10 pulses of 0.2 Gy with an inter-pulse interval of 3 minutes (PRT), to the same total daily dose of 2 Gy. TMZ (10mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage 1 hr prior to daily RT or PRT treatment. At sacrifice, tumors were harvested for immunohistochemistry. Result(s): TMZ (10mg/kg) produced a modest growth delay of 2 weeks compared with controls (p<0.05). Compared to TMZ alone, combining TMZ with RT or PRT resulted in an additional 3-4 week growth delay (p<0.01). PRT+TMZ also resulted in a larger decline in SUVmax after treatment than RT+TMZ (p=0.01), but the SUVmax rebounded for each group during regrowth. Less normal brain damage, as assessed by Nissl staining, was seen after PRT+TMZ as compared with RT+TMZ (p<0.01). Levels of tumor apoptosis (TUNEL), proliferation (Ki67) and recruitment of CD45+/F4/80+ macrophages to the invasive tumor margins were similar for both the RT+TMZ and the PRT+TMZ treated groups. Significantly, CD45+/CD133+ bone marrow-derived cells were only seen in the hypoxic regions of tumors treated with TMZ alone or RT+/-TMZ, and not in tumors that that received PRT+/-TMZ. Conclusion(s): PRT+TMZ proved to be the most efficacious treatment, with diminished normal tissue side effects, as compared to the other treatment groups. Although the overall rate of tumor regrowth was similar after PRT+TMZ and RT+TMZ, PRT+TMZ produced a more effective initial response as determined by tumor volume and SUVmax. Interestingly, while normal tissue sparing with PRT was expected, the recruitment of the CD45+/CD133+ subpopulation of bone marrow-derived monocytic lineage cells to the hypoxic regions of other groups was unanticipated. These CD45+/CD133+ cells may ultimately be responsible for a microenvironment that causes faster regrowth. However, since the PRT-TMZ treated tumors regrew without CD45+/CD133+ cell recruitment, this suggests that there is an alternative pathway, and/or associated cell types, that are responsible for post-treatment tumor progression. This pathway may present an additional novel target for inhibition in multimodal treatment strategies for GBM.",Excluded
2392,"Preclinical evaluation of <sup>212</sup>Pb-based alpha-particle therapy for neuroendocrine tumors: dosimetry and potential toxicities. Objectives: Peptide receptor-targeted radionuclide therapy (PRRT) targeting somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) has emerged as a promising therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. Beta-particle PRRT using <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-tyr -octreotate ( <sup>11</sup>Lu- DOTATATE) has been shown to significantly improve progression-free survival for NET patients compared to the standard of care treatment in a Phase 3 trial (1). However, the overall response rate is limited and complete responses are rare. Emerging evidence suggests that alpha-particle PRRT (alpha-PRRT) has the potential to improve tumor response. However, concerns regarding potential toxicities to normal organs and tissues (e.g., kidneys, bone marrow) mandate development and evaluation of personalized dosimetric approaches which can be used in clinical studies to reduce these toxicities. In this study, we evaluated potential renal and bone marrow toxicities arising from <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTA-tyr -octreotide ( <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC) in an animal model. A dosimetry study was performed on each animal with the aim of examining the relationship between localized <sup>212</sup>Pb alpha+beta dose to kidneys (a dose-limiting organ for beta PRRT) and markers of kidney function, injury, and kidney morphological changes. Method(s): 14.8 MBq of <sup>203</sup>Pb-DOTATOC was administered to tumor-free CD1-Elite (SOPF) mice via tail vein and SPECT/CT images were obtained at 1.5 h and 22 h post-injection. After 1.5 weeks, the same group of mice (8 mice) was divided into 4 groups, and each group was injected with escalating activities of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC (0.037, 0.074, 0.118, and 0.178 MBq/g). The absorbed dose (alpha/beta) from <sup>212</sup>P b - DOTATOC was estimated by the OLINDA/EXM software based on the time-activity curves obtained from <sup>203</sup>Pb-DOTATOC SPECT/CT images. The renal mass of each mouse used in this calculation was obtained from the CT-delineated volume with an assumed density of 1.05 g/cm<sup>2</sup> . In order to assess acute and chronic kidney injury by the radiotherapeutic, blood or urine were collected at day 1, day 3, week 3, week 12, and 7 months post-injection for analysis of nephrotoxicity parameters NGal (Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and Cystatin C. Another group of four mice was injected with the highest dose (0.178 MBq/g), and hematological toxicity was evaluated by serial complete blood counts (up to 5 weeks). Result(s): Escalated activities of Pb-DOTATOC resulted in increased estimated alpha doses in kidneys (6.6 Gy to 35.2 Gy). Contributions of beta particles were minimal compared to the alpha particles accounting for less than 4% of the total absorbed dose. We found evidence for mild acute renal tubular toxicity based on measures of serum NGAL levels in 6 of the 8 treated mice, although the elevated levels appeared to show no relationship to the kidney doses in this study. There was no evidence of changes in renal function in this group when evaluated by continued normal levels of serum Cystatin C out to 12 weeks post administration of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC. We observed a 50% average decline in platelets and 40% average decline in WBC 2-3 weeks following administration of 0.178 MBq/g of <sup>212</sup>Pb-DOTATOC in mice. These nadir values returned to baseline levels at 5 weeks post administration. Ongoing kidney histopathology studies will provide further information concerning the level of chronic renal toxicity of <sup>212</sup>PbDOTATOC using this dosing strategy. Conclusion(s): <sup>212</sup>Pb imagingbased dosimetry can be utilized for <sup>212</sup>Pb dose estimation and can inform personalized dosimetryguided therapy with Pbbased therapeutics. Administration of <sup>212</sup>PbDOTATOC (0.037 0.178 MBq/g) resulted in mild acute tubular toxicity and reversible hematological toxicity. NGal is a sensitive biomarker for acute renal tubular toxicity, but observed levels were not proportional to increased absorbed alpha doses in this study.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma entails uncertain long-term risk of tumor recurrence and delayed cranial neuropathies. In addition, the underlying histopathologic changes to the tumor bed are not fully characterized. We seek to understand the clinical and histologic features of recurrent vestibular schwannoma after stereotactic radiation therapy.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Four patients who underwent microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannoma after primary stereotactic radiation therapy.INTERVENTION: Patients were treated primarily with gamma knife radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy followed by salvage microsurgery. Retrosigmoid craniotomy was used in all cases.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histopathologic review. Preoperative and postoperative facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann scale.RESULTS: We observed highly inconsistent radiation changes in the cerebellopontine angle and internal auditory canal. Fibrosis outside and within the tumor bed varied markedly, complicating microsurgical dissection. Light microscopy confirmed the presence of viable tumor in all cases. Histopathologic features were typical of vestibular schwannoma, and there was no significant scarring that could be attributed to radiation effect.CONCLUSIONS: The variable fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle and lack of radiation changes seen histopathologically in irradiated vestibular schwannoma suggest that a uniform treatment effect was not achieved in these cases. Although all four patients with preoperative cranial neuropathies were found intraoperatively to have fibrosis in the cerebellopontine angle, excellent preservation of facial nerve anatomy and function was possible with salvage microsurgical resection. Additional analyses are needed to clarify the histopathologic and molecular characteristics associated with vestibular schwannoma growth after stereotactic radiation. [References: 58]",Excluded

Background: We sought to determine the surgical treatment and functional outcome and identify the predictors of survival in a retrospective cohort of patients with spinal cord ependymoma using data collected from the Korea Spinal Oncology Research Group database. Method(s): The data regarding 88 patients who had been surgically treated for histologically confirmed spinal cord intramedullary and extramedullary ependymoma from January 1989 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Histopathological examination revealed myxopapillary ependymoma in 24 patients, ependymoma in 61 patients, and anaplastic ependymoma in 3 patients. Gross total removal was achieved in 72 patients, subtotal removal in 15 patients, and partial removal in 1 patient. Twenty patients were treated with postoperative radiation. Fifty-two patients had stable or improved postoperative neurological function, while 36 experienced neurological deterioration. A permanent decrease in McCormick classification grade was seen in 17 patients. The progression-free survival rate was 87% for all patients at 5 years and 80% at 10 years. During follow-up, local recurrence/progression was seen in 13 patients. Diffuse meningeal spread developed in 2 anaplastic ependymoma patients. Postoperative radiotherapy after incomplete resection did not significantly correlate with longer times to recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed histology and surgical extent of resection as independent predictors of longer progression-free survival. Conclusion(s): Gross total removal alone is a good treatment strategy for spinal ependymomas. Early diagnosis and surgery, before severe paralysis, are important to obtain good functional outcomes. Subtotal resection with radiation therapy for intramedullary lesions appears to offer no advantages over gross total removal. © 2013 The Author(s).",Included

We hypothesized that chronic administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, to young adult male rats would prevent/ameliorate fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive impairment. Eighty 12-14-week-old young adult male Fischer 344 rats received either: (1) sham irradiation, (2) 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation delivered as two 5 Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks, (3) sham irradiation plus continuous administration of 15 mg/L of ramipril in the drinking water starting 3 days before irradiation, or (4) fractionated whole-brain irradiation plus ramipril. Cognitive function was assessed using a perirhinal cortex-dependent version of the novel object recognition task 26 weeks after irradiation. Microglial activation was determined in the perirhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus 28 weeks after irradiation using the ED1 antibody. Neurogenesis was assessed in the granular cell layer and subgranular zones of the dentate gyrus using a doublecortin antibody. Fractionated whole-brain irradiation led to: (1) a significant impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, (2) a significant increase in activated microglia in the dentate gyrus but not in the perirhinal cortex, and (3) a significant decrease in neurogenesis. Continuous administration of ramipril before, during, and after irradiation prevented the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced changes in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function, as well as in microglial activation in the dentate gyrus. Thus, as hypothesized, continuous administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, can prevent the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced impairment in perirhinal cortex-dependent cognitive function.",Included

BACKGROUND: Exposure of the brain to ionizing radiation might promote the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).OBJECTIVE: Analysis of AD death rates versus radon background radiation and total background radiation in U.S. states.METHODS: Total background, radon background, cosmic and terrestrial background radiation measurements are from Assessment of Variations in Radiation Exposure in the United States and Report No. 160 - Ionizing Radiation Exposure of the Population of the United States. 2013 AD death rates by U.S. state are from the Alzheimer's Association.RESULTS: Radon background ionizing radiation was significantly correlated with AD death rate in 50 states and the District of Columbia (r = 0.467, p = 0.001). Total background ionizing radiation was also significantly correlated with AD death rate in 50 states and the District of Columbia (r = 0.452, p = 0.001). Multivariate linear regression weighted by state population demonstrated that AD death rate was significantly correlated with radon background (beta= 0.169, p < 0.001), age (beta= 0.231, p < 0.001), hypertension (beta= 0.155, p < 0.001), and diabetes (beta= 0.353, p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Our findings, like other studies, suggest that ionizing radiation is a risk factor for AD. Intranasal inhalation of radon gas could subject the rhinencephalon and hippocampus to damaging radiation that initiates AD.

Transgenic growth hormone (Tg) mice express elevated free radical processes and a progeroid syndrome of accelerated ageing. We examined bone marrow cells of Tg mice and their normal (Nr) siblings for three markers of DNA damage and assessed the impact of free radical stress using ionizing radiation. We also evaluated the radiation protection afforded by a dietary supplement that we previously demonstrated to extend longevity and reduce cognitive ageing of Nr and Tg mice. Spectral karyotyping revealed few spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in Nr or Tg. Tg mice, however, had significantly greater constitutive levels of both gammaH2AX and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) compared to Nr. When exposed to a 2-Gy whole-body dose of ionizing radiation, both Nr and Tg mice showed significant increases in DNA damage. Compared to Nr mice, irradiated Tg mice had dramatically higher levels of gammaH2AX foci and double the levels of chromosomal aberrations. In unirradiated mice, the dietary supplement significantly reduced constitutive gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in both Nr and Tg mice (normalizing both gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG in Tg), with little difference in gammaH2AX and 8-OHdG over constitutive levels. Induced chromosomal aberrations were also reduced, and in Nr mice, virtually absent. Remarkably, supplemented mice expressed 6-fold lower levels of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations compared to unsupplemented Nr or Tg mice. Based on our data, the dietary supplement appeared to scavenge free radicals before they could cause damage. This study validates Tg mice as an exemplary model of oxidative stress and radiation hypersensitivity and documents unprecedented radioprotection by a dietary supplement comprised of ingredients available to the general public.",Included

The aim of the present study was to investigate the microstructural characteristics of the brain lobes following radiotherapy (RT) for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) at distinct times. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D-T1-weighted imaging was performed in 70 age-and sex-matched subjects, 24 of whom were pre-treatment patients. The patients were divided into three groups, according to the time following completion of RT. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and gray matter (GM) volume were determined. The DTI data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics and the GM volume was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Compared with the pre-RT group, the mean FA values in the left parietal lobe white matter (WM) and right cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05). In addition, the mean FA values in the right parietal lobe WM decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05), compared with the pre-RT group. The FA level in the right temporal lobe remained significantly decreased, compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT. Furthermore, compared with pre-RT group, the GM volume in the bilateral frontal lobe, right occipital lobe, left parietal lobe, right temporal lobe and left cerebellum decreased significantly in the post-RT 0-6 month group (P<0.05), and in the bilateral temporal lobe, parietal lobe, right frontal lobe and left cerebellum, the GM volume decreased significantly in the post-RT 6-12 month group (P<0.05). The GM volume in the right temporal lobe, bilateral frontal lobe and bilateral cerebellum remained significantly decreased compared with that in the pre-RT group (P<0.05) for 1 year after RT.

2443,"The source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the goldfish: a differential irradiation protocol. We have used a partial irradiation paradigm to examine the provenance of cells that participate in Wallerian cellular responses in the goldfish visual system. Animals which received 50 Gy whole-body gamma-irradiation showed virtually complete inhibition of the proliferative burst usually seen after optic nerve section. These animals did, however, show a robust hyperplastic response in the optic tract that we believe represents the migration of nearby microglial cells into the affected tract. When only the postcephalic body was irradiated, proliferating cells in the major hematopoietic organs of the fish, the kidney and pronephros, were substantially inhibited. Despite this, the Wallerian cellular response in the visual paths was essentially normal. Thus, there is no obligate requirement for peripheral proliferative cells to participate in central Wallerian degeneration in the fish. However, when only the head was irradiated, and the hematopoietic organs were spared, there was a proliferative response in the visual system. We believe this represents the invasion of the visual pathways by peripheral blood cells through the optic nerve lesion and blood vessels in the nerve itself. This invasion, however, is not sufficient to generate substantial hyperplasia. In summary, although we find evidence for a small contribution by exogenous cells, the major source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the fish is the endogenous microglia. Our data underscore the importance of elucidating the mechanisms by which microglial cells are activated and the role that they play in regeneration.",Included

To examine the effect of X-irradiation on oligodendrocytes, the spinal cord of rats was exposed to 40 Gy of X-irradiation and the number of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors in the dorsal funiculi at T12 and L1 was determined by in situ hybridization using cRNA-probes for platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor (PDGFRalpha) (to identify oligodendrocyte progenitors), exon 3b of proteolipid protein (PLP) (to identify mature oligodendrocytes) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). X-irradiation resulted in no change in the number of PLP positive cells and no loss of myelin internodes, but caused an almost complete loss of PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, and a reduction in the number of MOG positive cells to a number similar to that found using the PLP exon 3b probe. Importantly, the number of radiation-sensitive MOG-expressing cells was similar to the number of PDGFRalpha positive cells. To determine if the radiation-sensitive MOG positive cells were the same population as the radiation sensitive PDGFRalpha-expressing cells, MOG and PDGFRalpha-expressing cells were isolated from the adult CNS using antibody coated magnetic beads. Twelve to thirteen percent of MOG positive cells were PDGFRalpha positive and nearly all the PDGFRa isolated cells were MOG and galactocerebroside positive. Double immunofluorescence revealed colocalization of NG2 and MOG on cells in the normal adult rat spinal cord. These results show that in situ in the adult rat spinal cord white matter oligodendrocyte progenitors are MOG positive and indicates that expression of MOG cannot be regarded a marker that only identifies mature myelin-supporting oligodendrocytes in tissue.",Included
2454,"Acute brain radiation injury of rabbits: A control study on proton MRS findings and histopathological changes. [Chinese]. Objective: To establish radiation induced brain injury rabbit models for observing <sup>1</sup>H-MRS changes and probing on the correlation between MRS findings and histopathological changes. Method(s): Twenty-seven adult New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 9 groups (each n=3). The rabbit brains were irradiated with a single dose of 25 Gy. The observation posts included pre-radiation and 1 to 8 weeks after radiation. Each group underwent single-voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS, after the completion of image acquisition, the animals were sacrificed, and histological specimens were obtained. Pathological changes were analyzed combined with MRS changes. Result(s): The metabolic ratios of choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) increased first and then decreased obviously. Cho/Cr was 1.52 +/- 0.28 pre-radiation, 3.20 +/- 0.72 at 4 weeks, and 2.04 +/- 0.05 at 8 weeks after radiation. The metabolic ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/Cr showed significant decrease tendency, which decreased to 1.28 +/- 0.05 8 weeks after radiation from pre-radiation value of 1.97 +/- 0.25. The metabolic ratios of Cho/NAA showed significant increase after irradiation, which increased to 2.04 +/- 0.78 at 8 weeks after radiation, while the value was 1.19 +/- 0.15 pre-irradiation. After irradiation, vascular changes included telangiectasias and thrombosis, which appeared 2 weeks after irradiation in the histology samples. From 4 weeks after irradiation, ueuron swelling, cytoplasm edema, astrocytosis and microglia hyperplasia could be observed, and demyelination were observed in the white matter and corpus callosum. Conclusion(s): The changes of MRS index are closely related with histopathological findings of acute brain radiation injury of rabbits. MRS can be used as an imaging method for early diagnosis of radiation brain injury. Copyright © 2012 by the Press of Chinese Journal of Medical Imaging Technology.",Included
2472,"Hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown. The vascular endothelial cell is believed to be a major target cell of radiation-induced injury to the central nervous system. Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier is associated with radiation-induced white matter lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hypoxia in radiation-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. Adult rats were irradiated with graded single doses of 0-22 Gy to the cervical spinal cord. At various times up to 28 weeks after radiation, blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability was assessed using immunohistochemistry with antialbumin antibody and gamma counting of (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Hypoxia was assessed using two 2-nitroimidazole markers, [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise and 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-l-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3,-pentafluoropropyl) acetamide (EF5), with binding in the rat spinal cord measured using gamma counting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In the nonirradiated rat spinal cord, there was no evidence of BSCB disruption or VEGF expression. After 16-22 Gy, there was a dose-dependent increase in albumin staining and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid activity beginning at 16 weeks, consistent with barrier breakdown. A similar dose-dependent increase in white matter astrocytes that showed immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization signals for VEGF was observed. No increase in VEGF-positive cells was observed in gray matter. By 20 weeks after 20-22 Gy, animals developed white matter necrosis associated with diffuse albumin staining. Irradiated rat spinal cord showed a dose (16-22 Gy)- and time-dependent (16-20 weeks after 22 Gy) increase in [(125)I]iodoazomycin arabinodise accumulation compared to nonirradiated controls. A similar pattern of dose- and time-dependent EF5 immunoreactivity was also observed in white matter. Areas of EF5 expression and VEGF in situ signals colocalized with areas of albumin immunoreactivity. It is concluded that there is a dose-dependent temporal and spatial association of hypoxia, VEGF up-regulation, and radiation-induced BSCB dysfunction. Hypoxia may provide the signal for VEGF up-regulation and perpetuate endothelial permeability damage in the central nervous system after ionizing radiation.",Included
2473,"Endothelial apoptosis initiates acute blood-brain barrier disruption after ionizing radiation. Acute disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) is well recognized after radiation therapy to the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed the genetic regulation of acute BBB disruption and its relationship to vascular endothelial cell death in the CNS after irradiation. Adult rats were given graded single doses of X-ray to the cervical spinal cord. At different time intervals after irradiation, the irradiated spinal cord was processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Disruption of blood-spinal cord barrier was assessed using albumin immunohistochemistry, i.v. injection of Evans blue dye, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. In the rat spinal cord, there was a dose-dependent apoptotic response during the first 24 h after irradiation, and apoptotic cells consisted of both endothelial and glial cells, as described previously (1, 2). A dose-dependent reduction in endothelial cell density was observed at 24 h after irradiation. This was associated with a similar dose-dependent disruption in blood-spinal cord barrier as demonstrated by albumin immunohistochemistry. Radiation-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells has been shown to be dependent on the acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) pathway. After a single 50-Gy dose to the cervical spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was a 47.7% reduction in endothelial cell density at 24 h compared with nonirradiated controls. No decrease in endothelial cell density was observed in irradiated ASMase -/- mice. In the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase +/+ mice, there was evidence of albumin immunoreactivity and Evans blue dye staining around microvessels, and (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid uptake increased at 24 h. Nonirradiated controls and the irradiated spinal cord of ASMase -/- mice demonstrated no evidence of leakage. We conclude that apoptosis of endothelial cells initiates acute BBB disruption in the CNS after irradiation and that acute BBB disruption after irradiation is mediated by the ASMase pathway.",Included
2475,"Relationship between WBRT total dose, intracranial tumor control, and overall survival in NSCLC patients with brain metastases - a single-center retrospective analysis. Background: The relationship between whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) dose with intracranial tumor control and overall survival (OS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases (BM) is largely unknown. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 595 NSCLC BM patients treated consecutively at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between 2013 to 2015. We assigned the patients into 4 dose groups of WBRT: none, < 30, 30-39, and >= 40 Gy and assessed their relationship with OS and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS). Cox models were utilized. Covariates included sex, age, KPS, BM lesions, extracranial metastasis, BM and lung tumor resection, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and focal radiotherapy modalities. Result(s): Patients had a mean age of 59 years and were 44% female. Their median survival time (MST) of OS and iPFS were 9.3 and 8.9 months. Patients receiving none (344/58%), < 30 (30/5%), 30-39 (93/16%), and >= 40 (128/22%) Gy of WBRT had MST of OS (iPFS) of 7.3 (6.8), 6.0 (5.4), 10.3 (11.9) and 11.9 (11.9) months, respectively. Compared to none, other WBRT groups had adjusted HRs for OS - 1.23 (p > 0.20), 0.72 (0.08), 0.61 (< 0.00) and iPFS - 1.63 (0.03), 0.71 (0.06), 0.67 (< 0.01). Compared to 30-39 Gy, WBRT dose >=40 Gy was not associated with improved OS and iPFS (all p > 0.40). Stratified analyses by 1-3 and >= 4 BM lesions and adjustment analyses by each prognostic index of RPA class, Lung-GPA and Lung-molGPA supported these relationships as well. Conclusion(s): Compared to none, WBRT doses >=30 Gy are invariably associated with improved intracranial tumor control and survival in NSCLC BM patients. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Included
2476,"Radiation-Induced Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Retinal Alterations in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the early neurovascular alterations of the retina in radiation encephalopathy (RE) patients with normal-ranged visual acuity after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Method(s): Fifty-five RE patients and 54 healthy age-matched subjects were enrolled in this retrospective cross-sectional case-control study. The best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) of the included eye should not be more than 0. The vessel density and thickness of different locations in the retina were acquired automatically using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The data were then compared between the RE patients and the controls. The location included the whole retina, the superficial vascular plexus (SVP)/the ganglion cell complex (GCC), the deep vascular plexus (DVP), and the choroid in the macular area, as well as the inside disc and peripapillary area in the optic nerve head (ONH). The risk factors in OCTA retinal impairments were analyzed using a backward multiple linear regression. The relationships between mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) in the visual field (VF) and the OCTA parameters were also analyzed in RE patients. Result(s): The vessel density of the GCC was significantly reduced in RE patients compared with controls (p = 0.018), and the reductions were mainly shown in the parafoveal (p = 0.049) and perifoveal fields (p = 0.006). The thickness of the GCC was correspondingly reduced (whole image GCC mean thickness: p = 0.044; parafoveal thickness: p = 0.038; perifoveal thickness: p = 0.038). In addition, the sub-foveal choroidal thickness (p = 0.039) was also reduced in RE patients. The vessel density of the GCC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.643) and DVP (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.777) had a significant positive correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and had a significant negative correlation with age (GCC: HDL-C, beta = 29.89, p = 0.005; ApoA1, beta = 78.92, p = 0.002; age, beta = -0.886, p = 0.001; DVP: HDL-C, beta = 40.09, p = 0.003; ApoA1, beta = 62.65, p = 0.013; age, beta = -1.31, p = 0.001). The vessel density of the GCC also had a significant negative correlation with apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (beta = -32.18, p = 0.006). In the VF, MD had a significant positive correlation with the vessel density inside disc (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.241, beta = 0.304, p = 0.045), whereas PSD showed a significant negative correlation with the vessel density inside disc and the average GCC thickness, respectively (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.437; vessel density inside disc, beta = -0.358, p = 0.004; average GCC thickness, beta = -0.510, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): With the aid of OCTA, we found that neurovascular alterations of the retina may exist in RE patients with normal-ranged visual acuity. Herein, we suggest the implementation of OCTA to assist ophthalmologists in the early detection and consistent monitoring of radiation-related eye diseases to avoid delayed diagnosis. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Zhan, Xiao and Lan.",Included
2481,"Short- and long-term effects of irradiation on laryngeal mucosa of the rat. Although radiotherapy is often used to treat laryngeal carcinoma, there is little information on the effects of this treatment on laryngeal structures. Rats were irradiated to the head and neck region and the larynges were studied by light- and electron-microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Ten days after irradiation, a change in the ultrastructural appearance of the granules of the subglottic glands was observed. Substance P-, bombesin- and enkephalin-like immunoreactivity was increased in local ganglionic cells and glandular nerve fibres. The mast cells were reduced in number. At examination 4 6 months after irradiation, there were no obvious differences compared with controls concerning mast-cell numbers and neuropeptide expression. The ultrastructural changes seen in the subglottic glands remained to some extent. The results show that structural changes in the subglottic glands occur concomitantly with an increased expression of certain neuropeptides in the innervation of these glands, which implies a relationship between these two parameters. The mast cells respond drastically to irradiation, but in the long run, regeneration of these cells occurs.",Included

This study aimed to assess the effect of supplementation with omega-3 in Wistar rats exposed to ionizing radiation in a dose of 18 Gy on the cortical electrical activity, using mathematical methods such as the power spectrum (PS) and the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) in the evaluation of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) record. The PS analysis showed that in non-irradiated animals but supplemented with omega-3 there was a decrease in the power of the beta rhythm, while the DFA applied to different frequency ranges of the ECoG showed a significant increase in the long-range correlation only for the theta wave when compared with non-supplemented animals. In the evaluation of the radiation effect through the PS, an increase in the power of the theta rhythm was observed in both groups (non-supplemented and supplemented animals) only when they were evaluated one week after irradiation. The DFA method also showed difference in this wave. The PS and DFA methods applied to the ECoG record allowed a quantitative analysis of the cortical electrical activity in rats in response to the omega-3 effects, ionizing radiation, or both.",Included
2494,"Using superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetics to manipulate the redox environment of neural precursor cells. Past work has shown that neural precursor cells are predisposed to redox sensitive changes, and that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the acute and persistent changes that occur within the irradiated CNS. Irradiation leads to a marked rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that correlates with oxidative endpoints in vivo and reductions in neurogenesis. To better understand the impact of oxidative stress on neural precursor cells, and to determine if radiation-induced oxidative damage and precursor cell loss after irradiation could be reduced, a series of antioxidant compounds (EUK-134, EUK-163, EUK-172, EUK-189) were tested, three of which possess both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and one (EUK-163) whose only significant activity is SOD. Our results show that these SOD/catalase mimetics apparently increase the oxidation of a ROS-sensitive fluorescent indicator dye, particularly after short (12 h) treatments, but that longer treatments (24 h) decrease oxidation attributable to radiation-induced ROS. Similarly, other studies found that cells incubated with CuZnSOD showed some increase in intracellular ROS levels. Subsequent data suggested that the dye-oxidising capabilities of the EUK compounds were linked to differences in their catalase activity and, most likely, their ability to catalyse peroxidative pathways. In unirradiated mice, the EUK-134 analogue induced some decrease of proliferating precursor cells and immature neurons 48 h after radiation, an effect that may be attributable to cytotoxicity and/or inhibition of precursor proliferation. In irradiated mice, a single injection of EUK-134 was not found to be an effective radioprotector at acute times (48 h). The present results support continued development of our in vitro model as a tool for predicting certain in vivo responses, and suggest that in some biological systems the capability to scavenge superoxide but produce excess H(2)O(2), as is known for CuZnSOD, may be potentially deleterious. Our results also show that the ability of catalase mimetics, like true catalases, to catalyse peroxidase reactions can complicate the interpretation of data obtained with certain fluorescent ROS-indicator dyes.",Included
2504,"Treatment of spinal cord ependymomas by surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of complete resection and postoperative radiotherapy in spinal cord ependymomas. Methods and materials: We conducted a retrospective study over 20 patients (13 males and 7 females) with histologically confirmed spinal cord ependymomas between July 1985 and April 2001. Among them, 13 patients had ependymomas, 6 had myxopapillary ependymomas, and 1 had anaplastic ependymoma. All patients received radical surgery for tumor removal with 13 patients achieving complete resection and 7 incomplete resection due to technical difficulty. Among those with incomplete resection, 6 patients received postoperative radiotherapy to tumor bed and only one patient with anaplastic ependymoma received surgery alone. The total tumor dose ranged from 50 to 60 Gy. Result(s): Among the 20 patients, 19 patients were alive and showed local control. The median survival time of all patients was 109 months, with 104 months in the complete resection alone group and 135 months in the incomplete resection with postoperative radiotherapy group. One patient with anaplastic ependymoma and no postoperative radiotherapy developed leptomeningeal seeding 9 months after surgery. Salvage therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy maintained normal neurological functions. The patient expired 34 months from the initial diagnosis due to progression of leptomeningeal seeding. Conclusion(s): Complete resection alone in spinal cord ependymoma can achieve excellent local control and survival. Patients should receive complete resection if technically possible. Postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended for complete resection. For incomplete resection, postoperative local radiotherapy is recommended and it can also achieve excellent local control and survival. Local radiotherapy with 50-60 Gy is effective and safe.

Late pathological changes in the microvascular system after the acute irradiation (3 Gy) were not found. In the same time, after chronic irradiation with equivalent dose (the accumulated dose was 3 Gy) the depletion of endothelial cell population, and multiple foci of minor pathological changes of endotheliocyte ultrastructure at as many as 50% of the population were revealed. It may be more likely to lead to reduction of tolerance of brain microvascular system to an acute radiation (10 Gy) in the late period after chronic exposure.

A case-control study in long-term survivors from cancer in the head and neck region. BACKGROUND: Adult patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disorders have compromised quality of life (QoL). Whether this is due to their endocrine consequences (hypopituitarism), their underlying hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or both is still under debate. The aim of this trial was to measure quality of life (QoL) in long-term cancer survivors who have received a radiation dose to the basal part of the brain and the pituitary.METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=101) treated for oropharyngeal or epipharyngeal cancer with radiotherapy followed free of cancer for a period of 4 to10 years were identified. Fifteen patients (median age 56 years) with no concomitant illness and no hypopituitarism after careful endocrine evaluation were included in a case-control study with matched healthy controls. Doses to the hypothalamic-pituitary region were calculated. QoL was assessed using the Symptom check list (SCL)-90, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and Psychological Well Being (PGWB) questionnaires. Level of physical activity was assessed using the Baecke questionnaire.RESULTS: The median accumulated dose was 1.9 Gy (1.5-2.2 Gy) to the hypothalamus and 2.4 Gy (1.8-3.3 Gy) to the pituitary gland in patients with oropharyngeal cancer and 6.0-9.3 Gy and 33.5-46.1 Gy, respectively in patients with epipharyngeal cancer (n=2). The patients showed significantly more anxiety and depressiveness, and lower vitality, than their matched controls.CONCLUSION: In a group of long time survivors of head and neck cancer who hade received a low radiation dose to the hypothalamic-pituitary region and who had no endocrine consequences of disease or its treatment QoL was compromised as compared with well matched healthy controls.",Included
