2856,"Small cell cancer of the anal canal - Case report of a rare tumor Background: We report on a rare case of small cell cancer located at the anal canal. Case report: A 41-year old woman presented with locally advanced small cell anal cancer and simultaneous hepatic and pulmonal deposits. Due to metastatic disease, chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin was performed with mixed response after four cycles of chemotherapy. After application of two additional chemotherapy cycles, locally progressive disease occurred causing symptomatic bowel obstruction. Pelvic irradiation was started and several days later, additional irradiation of cerebral metastases was initiated due to rapid progression of distant disease. Despite adequate local treatment the patient's condition further deteriorated and irradiation was stopped. The patient died 10 months after initial diagnosis due to rapid tumor progression. Conclusion(s): In patients with metastatic small cell anal cancer chemotherapy remains the mainstay of therapy. Radiotherapy exerts additional activity and remains a prime choice to gain local control and ameliorate symptoms. Careful histopathological examination, together with immunohistochemistry, is needed to determine the therapeutic strategy to be followed.",Excluded

2452,"Functional and structural recovery of injured spinal cord following delayed X-irradiation in rats OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that delayed X-irradiation can enhance the functional and structural recovery of the injured spinal cord in rats.METHODS: Seventy Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups, 35 rats in each. The control group sustained a one-minute clip compression (force of clip was 30 g) injury of the spinal cord at the T2 level, without X-irradiation. The experimental group received X-irradiation 14 days after injury. Neurological function was assessed by the modified Tarlov method, including hind limbs movement, inclined plane, and pain withdrawal. These tests were performed in a blinded fashion at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days after injury. At 43 days after injury, histological examination of the injured spinal cord was performed following decapitation of the rats.RESULTS: Sixty-two rats met the experimental requirements (spinal cord injury was similar), 32 rats in experimental group and 30 rats in control group. Statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in hind limbs movement and inclined plane (P < 0.01), but not in the pain withdrawal test. The edema and necrosis areas of injured spinal cords in experimental group were less than those in control group, and axons in experimental group were significantly more than those in control group (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Delayed X-irradiation following spinal cord injury may enhance functional recovery by improving and restoring structural integrity of the injured spinal cord in rats.",Excluded
2500,"Circulating tumor cells with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition are associated with distant metastatic failures in lung cancer patients treated with definitive chemoradiation Purpose/Objective(s): Preclinical studies suggest that radiation can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance matrix invasion in several tumor types. To assess if this occurs clinically, we analyzed circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for EMT markers (EMT-CTC) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiation. Materials/Methods: This prospective study enrolled 22 patients between April 2011 and May 2012. The primary endpoint was distant metastatic free survival (DMFS) rates. None had induction chemotherapy. One patient had hypofractionated protons without chemotherapy. Serial blood samples (20 mL) were drawn at baseline (pretreatment), twice during treatment, and once at first follow-up. One tube of blood (10 mL) was sent to enumerate cytokeratin (CK)-positive/CD45-negative cells (HD-CTCs) using an automated microscopic image analysis system. A second tube was analyzed using the StemDx assay, a quantitative PCR-based assay to detect transcripts of EMT markers (SNAIL, TWIST, TG2, and CMET) on CTC in peripheral blood samples depleted of CD326/EpCAM+ CTC and CD45+ leukocytes by antibody coated magnetic beads. DMFS time was counted from date of first blood draw to the DM or death or last contact. Deaths without DM on the date of last contact were counted as events. Due to the small sample size, all times to event were subjected to univariable analysis using the method of Kaplan-Meier and the comparisons of distributions between groups were made using the log-rank test. Result(s): Patients had either stage 3A/B (n = 16), oligometastatic stage 4 (bone or brain) (n=2), or localized recurrent or positive margin disease after surgery that was amendable for definitive treatment (n = 4). The median follow-up for all patients from the time of first blood draw to the last contact date or death was 9.5 months, and for living patients was 11.1 months. At last follow-up, 8 had died, 8 progressed with DM, and 2 had in-field local relapse. Using the Epic Sciences assay,DMFSwas significantly associated with>=10 HD-CTCs/mL of blood (p = 0.036). The presence of CMET or SNAIL transcripts on CTC by StemDx also significantly predicted for both DMFS (p= 0.036) and recurrence of any type (p =0.02). Conclusion(s): In this pilot study, we found an association between DMFS and either >= 10 HD-CTC/mL of blood or EMT markers CMET or SNAIL in NSCLC patients undergoing definitive chemoradiation. While these data need to be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients, EMT-CTCs may reflect metastatic burden as seen in some of the patients with elevated HD-CTC counts, and may be valuable biomarkers to risk stratify patients after definitive chemoradiation.",Excluded
2913,"Contrast visual acuities in cataract patients. I. Comparison with normal subjects Contrast sensitivity and glare sensitivity are often abnormal in cataract patients. However, despite significant subjective complaints, relatively good visual acuities often are obtained with high-contrast optotypes. Using Variable-Contrast Visual Acuity Charts (VCVAC), we measured visual acuities of 40 eyes of 24 normal subjects (visual acuity greater than or equal to 1.0) aged 41 to 72 years, and 40 eyes of 28 cataract patients (visual acuity greater than or equal to 0.6) aged 44 to 81 years. The VCVAC consists of 4 different charts (1-4). The contrast is 90% in charts 1 and 4, 15% in chart 2 and 2.5% in chart 3. Chart 4 is the reverse polarity of chart 1. The decrease of visual acuity compared with the high-contrast chart (chart 1) was larger in the cataract group with both in the 15% contrast (0.52 vs. 0.71 octave) and the 2.5% contrast (1.21 vs. 1.75 octaves). In cataract group, 23/40 eyes (57.5%) showed better visual acuity with chart 4 than that of chart 1. In addition to high-contrast optotypes, acuity measurements using intermediate- to low-contrast optotypes, combined with the reverse polarity chart, seem effective in analyzing the visual disabilities caused by early cataract.",Excluded
2739,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and alzheimer's disease Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy age-matched controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Rates of decline were -0.028 FA units per year in FTLD in the genu of the CC, and -0.017 FA units per year in AD in splenium of the CC. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD.",Excluded
3570,"Role of radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy in the management of vestibular schwannomas. [French] Purpose of the study: In order to investigate the role of radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy in the management of vestibular schwannomas, we have reviewed our own prospective cohort and the main series of the modern literature. Patients and Methods: Between July 14th 1992 and June 1st 2011, 2991 vestibular schwannomas were operated on the Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery Department of Timone University Hospital. All the patients have been evaluated prospectively, with a follow up longer than 3 years for 2336 patients, excluding patients suffering from type 2 neurofibromatosis (148 patients). In 7% of the patients, the vestibular schwannoma had previously been resected. According to Koos classification, in 17.6% of the patients, vestibular schwannomas were stage I, 51.8% stage II, 27% stage III and 3.6% stage IV. The mean tumour volume was 2.63 cm<sup>3</sup>. According to Garner Robertson classification, the hearing was still functional at the time of radiosurgery in 46% and subnormal in 20.9% of the patients. Result(s): Long term tumour control was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. A transient facial palsy was observed in 0.5% of the cases. The rate of trigeminal injury was 0.5%. Useful hearing was preserved at 3 years in 78%. This rate reached 95% in patients with no past history of sudden hearing loss. Other predictors of functional hearing preservation are the young age, the small size of the lesion and a dose to the modiulus of the cochlea lower than 4. Gy. We observed no radio-induced tumour. Only large, Koos IV vestibular schwannomas are contraindicated for upfront radiosurgery. In these patients, we propose a combined approach with a deliberately partial microsurgical removal, followed by a radiosurgery of the residue. Conclusion(s): This cohort is unique by the size of the population and the length of the follow up and results demonstrate the efficacy of radiosurgery and its safety, especially its high rate of hearing preservation. © 2012 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).",Excluded
3258,"Whole-Body versus Routine Skull Base to Mid-thigh <sup>18</sup>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/ Computed Tomography in Patients with Malignant Melanoma Objectives: The objectives of this study are to assess the utility of whole-body <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT) (skull vertex to toes) imaging relative to the standard field of view (skull base to mid-thigh) in patients with primary melanoma site that is not located in the lower extremities.Material and Methods: The primary site of the melanoma and metastatic disease was determined based on <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT findings in 26 patients. The FDG avid sites were tabulated as the primary site, lower extremity, brain, and other sites. The hypothesis is that routine skull base to mid-thigh versus whole-body <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT in patients with malignant melanoma will not change management.Results: Patients (26) were divided into those with primary melanoma site in either the lower extremities (six patients) or other site (20 patients). Four of the six patients with the primary site in the lower extremities also had positive findings in the ipsilateral inguinal lymph nodes. One of the patients with a positive inguinal lymph node had metastatic sites in the external iliac region and lungs on the initial study. On follow-up imaging, this patient also exhibited diffuse metastatic disease, including a lower extremity. None of the remaining patients in this group had positive findings other than the primary site in the lower extremity. Of the remaining 20 patients with the primary site not in the lower extremity, one had diffuse metastatic disease that included a lower extremity. However, lower extremity involvement would not change patient management in this case. A second patient in this group had diffuse metastatic disease that also involved the brain. However, no metastatic disease was present in the lower extremities in this patient. None of the remaining 18 patients in this group had metastatic disease in a lower extremity. Two patients in the entire study group of 26 had brain metastasis on contrast-enhanced head CT, with one having multiple brain metastasis. PET failed to demonstrate some of the brain lesions. In the other patient with solitary brain metastasis detected on contrast-enhanced head CT, PET was negative.Conclusion: <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT imaging of the lower extremity may not be justified if the primary neoplasm is not located in the lower extremities. Elimination of lower extremity imaging will reduce scanning time and additional radiation exposure. Similarly, PET/CT imaging of the brain may not be justified if contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging of the head is already obtained since these are more sensitive.",Excluded
3586,"The relationship between mood symptoms and neuropsychological function in breast cancer survivors Objective: Breast cancer survivors show neuropsychological deficits in domains such as language and memory that are suspected to be a result of the harmful effects of cancer treatments. Mood symptoms may exacerbate these problems, however, little is known about the exact relationship between these variables. Participants and Methods: We examined a group of 87 breast cancer survivors, mean age 58.7 years, who had received diagnoses of breast cancer 2-22 years prior (mean 6.1 years). Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests that assessed intellectual function, executive function, and memory, and several self-report questionnaires that assessed mood, fatigue, and quality of life. Result(s): Pearson analyses demonstrated significant negative correlations between scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer & Brown, 1996) and the Full Scale IQ,VerbalComprehension Index, and Processing Speed Index scores of theWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III(Wechsler, 1997). BDI-II scores also showed significant negative correlations with some measures of executive function, but not with measures of memory. Analysis of variance showed that breast cancer survivors who had been treated with chemotherapy reported more symptoms of depression than individuals who had not been treated with chemotherapy, F = 9.51, p = .003. A similar pattern was not found for individuals who had been treated with radiation. Patients' history of chemotherapy and radiation treatment did not show any relationship to subsequent neuropsychological function. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that elevated mood symptoms may be related to problems in some domains of neuropsychological performance in breast cancer survivors. Individuals who had received chemotherapy appeared more likely to experience subsequent mood problems. Further investigation is needed to determine if mood changes may increase susceptibility to the cognitive deficits experienced by breast cancer survivors. Acknowledgement: Study funded by Susan G.

2728,"Anti-emetic effect of ondansetron and granisetron after exposure to mixed neutron and gamma irradiation The anti-emetic efficiency of orally administered ondansetron and granisetron has been tested in macaques exposed to a mixed y and neutron radiation (6 Gy) with a high neutron/gamma-ray ratio. Our experiments reveal that a single delivery of ondansetron (1 or 2 mg kg(-1)) or of granisetron (0.25 mg kg(-1)) 45-90 min before irradiation or 35-45 min after irradiation was not totally effective. Conversely, the delivery of two doses with the same delay prior to and after exposure led to a complete prevention of vomiting and retching. These observations can be explained by the dual mechanism of radiation-induced emesis: an early peripheral mechanism and a later central mechanism. Two deliveries of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists seem to disrupt serotonergic transmission at the brain stem structures and to affect the peripheral release of serotonin from the gut, thus completely preventing radiation-induced vomiting. This study confirms that the 5-HT3-dependent mechanisms that mediate emesis are similar for both neutron and gamma radiation.",Excluded

2521,"Transforming growth factor-beta promotes glioblastoma multiforme to establish radiation resistance by mesenchymal differentiation Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor. Current standard therapy is surgery combined with radio-therapy and/or chemo-therapy. Due to the existence of resistance, GBM is one of the most difficult-to-treat tumor. It has been shown radio-therapy may induce mesenchymal differentiation (MD). Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a modifier of radiation response, and plays an important role in cell transformation. Therefore, we hypothesized that TGF-beta pathway might be involved in the development of radiation resistance via regulating MD. Thus, we explored whether TGF-beta regulates MD in radiation resistance in GBM. We first examined the effect of radiation doses on cell viability by Trypan blue assay, and evaluated cell viability and morphology. The cells showed morphology change were defined as transformed cells. We used the radiation dose of 50% cell viability to establish consecutive-irradiation-induced resistance. The radiation dose of the cell viability greater than 50% was established high-dose-irradiation-induced resistance positive control. When viability of cells recovered from consecutive-irradiation exposures which were higher than positive control, the cells were defined as consecutive-irradiation-induced resistance. To develop radiation resistance, 3.5Gy exposure for 6 times were required for 1306MG, and 2Gy exposure for 4 times were needed for U87MG. The numbers of transformed cells increased in radiation resistant cells population. Moreover, immunocytochemistry staining showed expression of certain MD markers on transformed cells were different from on non-transformed cells. Immunoblotting results showed increased mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and decreased epithelial marker beta-catenin in radiation resistance. Finally, we used TGF-beta and TGF-beta receptor inhibitor LY364947 to determine if TGF-beta/Smad pathway regulates radiation-induced resistance. The immunoblotting results revealed that inhibition of TGF-beta pathway reversed MD in consecutive-irradiation-induced resistant cell lines via increasing the expression of beta-catenin and reducing the expression of N-cadherin and Fibronectin. We concluded that TGF-beta promotes GBM to establish radiation resistance by MD.",Excluded
3225,"Multi cranial neuropathy secondary to primary glioblastoma of trigeminal nerve: Case report Objective: To report a rare case of glioblastoma arising from trigeminal nerve with leptomeningeal spread of disease, and discuss the origin of this tumor. Background(s): Glioblastoma (GB) is a WHO Grade IV tumor typically arising in the supratentorial compartment of the brain. Gliomas arising from cranial nerves (CN) are extremely rare. Design/Methods: A 77 year old gentleman presented with four month history of numbness over the right side of his face and progressive bilateral hearing loss. One week prior to presentation, he also developed left facial weakness, left eye ptosis, diplopia and lower back pain. On examination, he was found to have loss of sensation in a V1-V3 distribution on the right, a left pupil sparing third nerve palsy, bilateral sensironeural hearing loss, and a left peripheral VII CN palsy Results: MRI brain showed a cisternal mass infiltrating the right CN V with extensive enhancement and thickening of bilateral CN including III, V, VII, and VIII. MRI of the spine showed nodular enhancement at the level of the cauda equina. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. Biopsy of the right CN V mass showed this to be glioblastoma. Conclusion(s): Leptomeningeal dissemination of glioblastoma is rare, occurring in about 4% of cases. In most of these cases, a parenchymal component is present that eventually disseminates along the ependymal lining of the brain to involve the leptomeninges. We here describe a unique presentation of a GB most likely arising from a CN followed by widespread leptomeningeal dissemination. The root entry zone (either the glial segment or the transition segment) of the cranial nerve is thought to be the anatomical point of origin for gliomas arising from CNs. Unfortunately despite being treated with radiation and chemotherapy, the patient passed away 3 months after presentation denoting the very poor prognosis associated with leptomeningeal spread of GB.",Excluded
3250,"Target size analysis of opioid receptors. No difference between receptor types, but discrimination between two receptor states Target size analysis of opioid receptor is complicated by the presence of multi-exponential inactivation curves. Irradiation of intact frozen tissue proved essential to eliminate such artifacts, due to indirect irradiation effects. Upon irradiation condition, opioid binding activity was inactivated in a single mono-exponential manner. Identical inactivation curves were obtained for mu, delta and kappa binding activities in brain membranes from rat, guinea-pig and frog and in NG 108-15 cells: the molecular mass obtained was 98 +/- 2 kDa. However, when opioid binding was assayed in the presence of Na+, Mg2+ and GTP, the molecular mass was found to be only 56 +/- 4.4 kDa. We suggest that the opioid recognition site comprises a unit of 56 kDa and that in the absence of Na+, Mg2+ and GTP an additional membrane component of 40-44 kDa is necessary for high-affinity opioid binding.",Excluded
3524,"Differential actions of corticotropin releasing factor on basolateral and central amygdaloid neurones, in vitro Intracellular current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from basolateral (BLA) and central (ACe) neurones of the rat amygdala in vitro. The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 muM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K<sup>+</sup> conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow afterhyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC<inf>50</inf> of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF<inf>9-41</inf> (5 muM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow afterhyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow afterhyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors.",Excluded
3242,"Dosimetric comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in total scalp irradiation: A single institutional experience Purpose: Total scalp irradiation (TSI) is a rare but challenging indication. We previously reported that non-coplanar intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was superior to coplanar IMRT in organ-at-risk (OAR) protection and target dose distribution. This consecutive treatment planning study compared IMRT with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective treatment plan databank search was performed and 5 patient cases were randomly selected. Cranial imaging was restored from the initial planning computed tomography (CT) and target volumes and OAR were redelineated. For each patients, three treatment plans were calculated (coplanar/non-coplanar IMRT, VMAT; prescribed dose 50 Gy, single dose 2 Gy). Conformity, homogeneity and dose volume histograms were used for plan. Result(s): VMAT featured the lowest monitor units and the sharpest dose gradient (1.6 Gy/mm). Planning target volume (PTV) coverage and homogeneity was better in VMAT (coverage, 0.95; homogeneity index [HI], 0.118) compared to IMRT (coverage, 0.94; HI, 0.119) but coplanar IMRT produced the most conformal plans (conformity index [CI], 0.43). Minimum PTV dose range was 66.8%- 88.4% in coplanar, 77.5%-88.2% in non-coplanar IMRT and 82.8%-90.3% in VMAT. Mean dose to the brain, brain stem, optic system (maximum dose) and lenses were 18.6, 13.2, 9.1, and 5.2 Gy for VMAT, 21.9, 13.4, 14.5, and 6.3 Gy for non-coplanar and 22.8, 16.5, 11.5, and 5.9 Gy for coplanar IMRT. Maximum optic chiasm dose was 7.7, 8.4, and 11.1 Gy (non-coplanar IMRT, VMAT, and coplanar IMRT). Conclusion(s): Target coverage, homogeneity and OAR protection, was slightly superior in VMAT plans which also produced the sharpest dose gradient towards healthy tissue. Copyright © 2016.

2620,"Extremely Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields Promote In Vitro Neuronal Differentiation and Neurite Outgrowth of Embryonic Neural Stem Cells via Up-Regulating TRPC1 Exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice. However, little is focused on the effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neurogenesis. Here, we studied the potential effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neural stem cells (eNSCs). We exposed eNSCs to ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1 mT) for 1, 2, and 3 days with 4 hours per day. We found that eNSC proliferation and maintenance were significantly enhanced after ELF-EMF exposure in proliferation medium. ELF-EMF exposure increased the ratio of differentiated neurons and promoted the neurite outgrowth of eNSC-derived neurons without influencing astrocyes differentiation and the cell apoptosis. In addition, the expression of the proneural genes, NeuroD and Ngn1, which are crucial for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth, was increased after ELF-EMF exposure. Moreover, the expression of transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) was significantly up-regulated accompanied by increased the peak amplitude of intracellular calcium level induced by ELF-EMF. Furthermore, silencing TRPC1 expression eliminated the up-regulation of the proneural genes and the promotion of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth induced by ELF-EMF. These results suggest that ELF-EMF exposure promotes the neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth of eNSCs via up-regulation the expression of TRPC1 and proneural genes (NeuroD and Ngn1). These findings also provide new insights in understanding the effects of ELF-EMF exposure on embryonic brain development.",Excluded
2861,"Role and relevance of neurocognitive assessment in clinical trials of patients with CNS tumors The inclusion of neurocognitive end points in clinical trials of patients with CNS tumors is increasing. Neurocognitive end points are used to understand what cognitive problems exist before treatment to establish a baseline by which the effect of treatment is judged, and to determine whether different treatment regimens improve neurocognitive function due to better tumor control, slow expected neurocognitive deterioration due to the tumor, or have more or less short- and long-term neurotoxicity. However, the use of neurocognitive end points in clinical trials for patients with CNS tumors is in its infancy, so that long-term outcomes are difficult to predict and the ability to determine the effects of different agents and treatment approaches is scant.

Exposure to light promoted a significant increase in the density of Egr-1 labeled nuclei in V1. Laminar distribution of immunoreactive nuclei in light-stimulated animals (LS) tended to vary with topography: the lateral region, which corresponds to the central representation of the visual field, appeared to have higher density of cells expressing protein in the supragranular layers, as compared to the medial region, which corresponds to the representation of the peripheral field of vision. Finally, LS animals displayed a narrow band of labeled cell nuclei in the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and throughout the anteroposterior extent of the superior colliculus (SC). In contrast, almost no Egr-1 immunolabeling was found in the IGL and SC of LD animals. Our report is the first demonstration of light-regulated expression of the Egr-1 gene in the opossum visual system and provides evidence that the expression of an activity-dependent gene related to neural plasticity is evolutionarily conserved in the visual cortex of the mammalian lineage.",Excluded
2528,"OFF response of bullfrog cones is shaped by terminal ionotropic GABA receptors We recently reported an ionotropic GABA receptor expressed at the bullfrog retinal cone terminal that is potentiated by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (BIC) and suppressed by the GABA(C) receptor antagonist imidazole-4-acetic acid (I4AA) . In this study, by using the patch clamp technique in current clamp mode, we show that activation of this GABA receptor causes voltage changes of cones, which are closely dependent on the membrane potential level in relation to the chloride equilibrium potential of the cells. Furthermore, the OFF overshoot of cone light responses is enhanced or diminished when this receptor is potentiated by BIC or suppressed by I4AA, suggesting the involvement of this GABA receptor in shaping OFF light responses of bullfrog cones.",Excluded

We present two patients who were successfully given ultrasound-guided superior hypogastric plexus block by an anterior approach. The anterior ultrasound-guided superior hypogastric plexus neurolysis technique is simple to perform. We believe this block can be useful in cancer patients who are having difficulty in lying prone, because it is a bedside procedure performed in the supine position and it is less time-consuming. It also avoids the radiation exposure involved with a computed tomography-guided anterior approach.",Excluded
3321,"Long-Term Deficits in Behavior Performances Caused by Low- and High-Linear Energy Transfer Radiation Efforts to protect astronauts from harmful galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) require a better understanding of the effects of GCR on human health. In particular, little is known about the lasting effects of GCR on the central nervous system (CNS), which may lead to behavior performance deficits. Previous studies have shown that high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in rodents leads to short-term declines in a variety of behavior tests. However, the lasting impact of low-, medium- and high-LET radiation on behavior are not fully defined. Therefore, in this study C57BL/6 male mice were irradiated with 100 or 250 cGy of gamma rays (LET ~0.3 KeV/mum), 10 or 100 cGy of <sup>1</sup>H at 1,000 MeV/n (LET ~0.2 KeV/mum), <sup>28</sup>Si at 300 MeV/n (LET ~69 KeV/mum) or <sup>56</sup>Fe at 600 MeV/n (LET of ~180 KeV/mum), and behavior metrics were collected at 5 and 9 months postirradiation to analyze differences among radiation qualities and doses. A significant dose effect was observed on recognition memory and activity levels measured 9 months postirradiation, regardless of radiation source. In contrast, we observed that each ion species had a distinct effect on anxiety, motor coordination and spatial memory at extended time points. Although <sup>28</sup>Si and <sup>56</sup>Fe are both regarded as high-LET particles, they were shown to have different detrimental effects on behavior. In summary, our findings suggest that GCR not only affects the CNS in the short term, but also has lasting damaging effects on the CNS that can cause sustained declines in behavior performance.",Included
2824,"Correlation of visual field, treatment fields, and dose in helium ion irradiation of uveal melanoma We correlated predicted radiation distributions in 29 patients with uveal melanoma (treated with 5,000 to 8,000 rads of helium ion therapy) with fundus photography and visual field deficits. The tumor was entirely within the treatment region in all patients. The fraction of the predicted high-dose and low-dose regions corresponding with an absolute scotoma was fitted by a linear regression model (r2 = .721) with three independent variables: dose region, initial condition, and time since therapy. The defect in the maximum-dose region increased at an average rate of 0.270/year. This differed (P = .002) from the rate in the penumbra region: (0.104/year). The rate in the penumbra differed (P = .01) from that in the predicted low-dose region, where scotoma did not increase with time. The pattern and time course of visual field loss in the different radiation dose regions tended to support the conclusion that isodose calculations are accurate. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that visual loss secondary to irradiation results primarily from radiation vasculopathy and not from direct damage to photoreceptors or ganglion cells. Development of an absolute scotoma may require a dose in excess of 5,000 rads.",Excluded
3063,"Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors enable two distinct forms of long-term depression in the rat dentate gyrus in vivo The existence of long-term depression (LTD) in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats, as well as the contribution of different types of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) to this form of plasticity, has been the subject of much debate. Here, we describe two distinct forms of mGluR-dependent hippocampal LTD in the dentate gyrus of freely moving adult rats. LTD, induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of the medial perforant path (LFS-LTD), was prevented by antagonism of the phospholipase C-coupled receptors, mGluR1 but not mGluR5. Chemical LTD, induced by intracerebral application of the group I mGluR agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, was blocked by antagonism of both mGluR5 and mGluR1. Selective activation of mGluR5, using (R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG), also led to chemical LTD. To test whether LFS-LTD and chemical LTD share common induction mechanisms, we applied LFS following the induction of chemical LTD by CHPG (CHPG-LTD). Surprisingly, LFS impaired CHPG-LTD. Further analysis revealed that induction of CHPG-LTD led to altered calcium dynamics sufficient for its reversal by LFS. We found that LTD induced by (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, but not by CHPG, is impaired by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism. Both forms of chemical LTD strongly require calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. This contrasts with previous findings that LFS-LTD in the dentate gyrus is both N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and voltage-gated calcium channel independent. LFS-LTD and LTD induced by group I mGluR agonists thus appear to comprise distinct forms of LTD that require the activation of specific group I mGluRs and recruit calcium from different sources.",Excluded
3406,"Small Cell Lung Cancer: Therapies and Targets Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a fatal disease due to limited therapeutic options. Systemic chemotherapy is the bedrock of treatment for both the limited and extensive stages of the disease. However, the established management paradigm of platinum-based chemotherapy has reached an efficacy plateau. A modest survival improvement, approximately 5%, was witnessed with the addition of cranial or thoracic radiation to systemic chemotherapy. Other strategies to improve outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in the last two decades have met with minimal success. The substitution of irinotecan for etoposide in the frontline treatment of SCLC achieved significant efficacy benefit in Japanese patients, but similar benefit could not be reproduced in other patient populations. Salvage treatment for recurrent or progressive SCLC is particularly challenging, where topotecan remains the only agent with regulatory approval to date. Ongoing evaluation of biologic agents targeting angiogenesis, sonic hedgehog pathway, DNA repair pathway, and immune checkpoint modulators hold some promise for improved outcome in SCLC. It is hoped that the coming decade will witness the application of new molecular biology and genomic research techniques to improve our understanding of SCLC biology and identification of molecular subsets that can be targeted appropriately using established and emerging biological agents similar to the accomplishments of the last decade with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3498,"Inhibition of Polo-like kinase 1 prevents the growth of metastatic breast cancer cells in the brain Few therapeutic strategies exist for the treatment of metastatic tumor cells in the brain because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits drug access. Thus the identification of molecular targets and accompanying BBB permeable drugs will significantly benefit brain metastasis patients. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an attractive molecular target because it is only expressed in dividing cells and its expression is upregulated in many tumors. Analysis of a publicly available database of human breast cancer metastases revealed Plk1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in brain metastases compared to systemic metastases (P = 0.0018). The selective Plk1 inhibitor, GSK461364A, showed substantial uptake in normal rodent brain. Using a breast cancer brain metastatic xenograft model (231-BR), we tested the efficacy of GSK461364A to prevent brain metastatic colonization. When treatment was started 3 days post-injection, GSK461364A at 50 mg/kg inhibited the development of large brain metastases 62% (P = 0.0001) and prolonged survival by 17%. GSK461364A sensitized tumor cells to radiation induced cell death in vitro. Previously, it was reported that mutations in p53 might render tumor cells more sensitive to Plk1 inhibition; however, p53 mutations are uncommon in breast cancer. In a cohort of 41 primary breast tumors and matched brain metastases, p53 immunostaining was increased in 61% of metastases; 44% of which were associated with primary tumors with low p53. The data suggest that p53 overexpression occurs frequently in brain metastases and may facilitate sensitivity to Plk1 inhibition. These data indicate Plk1 may be a new druggable target for the prevention of breast cancer brain metastases.",Excluded
3133,"Late-Onset Intractable Cerebrospinal Fluid Leakage After Stereotactic Radiotherapy After Resection of Giant Nonfunctioning Pituitary Adenoma Background: Late-onset skull base cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage after stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a very rare complication. Case Description: A 54-year-old woman came to our department for convulsions and was admitted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a giant tumor in the skull base region, including the sphenoid sinus, pituitary fossa, right cavernous sinus, right middle fossa, and right basal ganglia. Mild left hemiparesis was noted. An ophthalmologic examination revealed left side homonymous hemianopsia. Using an endonasal endoscopic surgical approach, tumor removal was performed, with the residual tumor removed with a transcranial approach. Residual tumor tissue remained around the right cavernous sinus; therefore, SRT was performed 1 month after the second procedure, which resulted in good control of growth. Four years later, spontaneous CSF leakage occurred, for which endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed. One month later, CSF leakage recurred, and the same procedure was again used. A third episode of recurrent CSF leakage occurred 5 days later. A transcranial approach was finally used for repair, and the patient showed complete recovery. Conclusion(s): Late-onset CSF leakage after SRT for a pituitary adenoma can be intractable, and several aggressive repair procedures may be needed, including a combination of endonasal and transcranial approaches.

3400,"Helium CT: Monte Carlo simulation results for an ideal source and detector with comparison to proton CT Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of relative stopping power and spatial resolution of images reconstructed with simulated helium CT (HeCT) in comparison to proton CT (pCT). Method(s): A Monte Carlo (MC) study with the TOPAS tool was performed to compare the accuracy of relative stopping power (RSP) reconstruction and spatial resolution of low-fluence HeCT to pCT, both using 200 MeV/u particles. An ideal setup consisting of a flat beam source and a totally absorbing energy-range detector was implemented to estimate the theoretically best achievable RSP accuracy for the calibration and reconstruction methods currently used for pCT. The phantoms imaged included a cylindrical water phantom with inserts of different materials, sizes, and positions, a Catphan phantom with a module containing high-contrast line pairs (CTP528) and a module with cylindrical inserts of different RSP (CTP404), as well as a voxelized 10-year-old female phantom. Dose to the cylindrical water phantom was also calculated. The RSP accuracy was studied for all phantoms except the CTP528 module. The latter was used for the estimation of the spatial resolution, evaluated as the modulation transfer function (MTF) at 10%. Result(s): An overall error under 0.5% was achieved for HeCT for the water phantoms with the different inserts, in all cases better than that for pCT, in some cases by a factor 3. The inserts in the CTP404 module were reconstructed with an average RSP accuracy of 0.3% for HeCT and 0.2% for pCT. Anatomic structures (brain, bones, air cavities, etc.) in the digitized head phantom were well recognizable and no artifacts were visible with both HeCT and pCT. The three main tissue materials (soft tissue, brain, and cranium) were well identifiable in the reconstructed RSP-volume distribution with both imaging modalities. Using 360 projection angles, the spatial resolution was 4 lp/cm for HeCT and 3 lp/cm for pCT. Generally, spatial resolution increased with the number of projection angles and was always higher for HeCT than for pCT for the same number of projections. When HeCT and pCT scan were performed to deliver the same dose in the phantom, the resolution for HeCT was higher than pCT. Conclusion(s): MC simulations were used to compare HeCT and pCT image reconstruction. HeCT images had similar or better RSP accuracy and higher spatial resolution compared to pCT. Further investigation of the potential of helium ion imaging is warranted. Copyright © 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",Excluded
3031,"Single domain antibody (SBT-100) crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and inhibits human glioblastoma by selectively targeting KRAS and P-STAT3 Background: Glioblastoma is difficult to treat malignancy that has a high incidence of KRAS mutations ( > 90%) and hyper-expression of P-STAT3 ( > 90%). Most chemotherapeutic agents and large biologics (four chain heterotetrameric IgG) cannot cross the BBB. Therefore Singh Biotechnology's (SBT) propriety technology has developed a novel targeted therapy and engineered SBT-100 a 15 kD single domain antibody (sdAb) that is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3, which can cross the BBB to target gliablastomas. Method(s): Human glioblastoma (U87MG) cell line was used and obtained from ATCC. Biacore affinity assay was used to demonstrate SBT-100 binding to KRAS, KRAS (G12D), and STAT3. The glioblastoma cells were incubated with 0ug/ml to 200ug/ml of SBT-100. MTT assay was performed after 3 days of treatment with SBT-100 and the growth inhibition was calculated. Xenograft (athymic nude mouse) with a well established tumor growing for 6 weeks was injected with SBT-100 intraperitoneally (IP). After 15 minutes the brain of this animal was harvested for immunohistochemical staining. Result(s): Biacore studies showed SBT-100 binds KRAS with affinity constant of 10- 9M, KRAS (G12D) at 10- 8M, and STAT3 at 10- 8M. MTT assay reveals 62% (p < 0.01) growth inhibition of U87MG within 3 days. A xenograft mouse with a well established tumor ( > 150mm<sup>3</sup>), when injected IP with 5mg/kg of SBT-100 showed localization in the brain within 15 minutes. Therefore SBT-100 (sdAb) crosses the BBB, and shows intracellular localization in the animal's neurons and glial cells. Conclusion(s): SBT-100 significantly inhibits the growth of glioblastoma. KRAS mutations and/or over expression of P-STAT3 in glioblastomas are promising targets for sdAbs like SBT-100, which is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3. SBT-100 crosses the BBB and localizes within the neurons and glial cells of the brain. SBT's proprietary single domain antibody technology platform used to engineer SBT- 100 holds promise for targeting primary brain malignancies, metastatic cancers that go to the brain, and for neurologic disease amenable to targeted therapy.

2519,"Effects of obesity on noninvasive test results in patients with suspected cardiac ischemia: Insights from the PROMISE trial BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), but adiposity may mimic symptoms of CAD and reduce the accuracy of diagnostic testing.METHODS: Patients from the PROMISE trial (n=8889) were classified according to body mass index (BMI). We assessed relationships between BMI, physician's preference of functional test, test positivity, and results of invasive coronary angiography (Cath) using logistic regression models.RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of the patients had BMI>=30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 20% had BMI>=35. Providers were more likely to prefer nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) over other functional tests as BMI increased. The rate of test positivity with coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was not different (10% vs. 12%) in patients with BMI >=35 vs. < 35. The same was true for stress echocardiogram and stress electrocardiogram (positivity 8-13%, P>0.8 for both). In contrast, MPI was significantly more likely to be positive in those with BMI >=35 vs. <35 (18% vs. 13%; P=0.001). The likelihood of obstructive CAD at Cath did not differ with BMI >=35 vs. <35 in patients having CTA (52% vs. 59%, P=0.22), but among MPI patients, Cath positivity was only 29% with BMI >=35 vs. 48% with BMI <35 (P=0.005). Radiation exposure increased with higher BMI in both MPI and CTA groups.CONCLUSIONS: Increasing levels of obesity adversely affect the diagnostic yield of MPI more than CTA. The degree of obesity should be considered when choosing evaluation strategies for patients with chest pain.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROMISE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01174550.",Excluded

The left internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm which developed within the irradiated field and stenotic change in the left ICA due to radiation-induced vasculopathy were detected incidentally. Because these aneurysms show a high risk of rupture and mortality, and even small aneurysms are prone to rupture, any such suspected aneurysm should be treated with surgical or endovascular procedures.

Special Session Intraprocedural radiation dose management 103.1 Occupational dosimetry in the interventional laboratory: dose limits and risk estimation G. Bartal Radiology, Meir MC, Kfar-Saba, Israel Learning Objectives 1. To learn about the potential risks of occupational radiation exposure 2. To learn about the dose limits for different organs and acceptable dose 3. To learn how to estimate the risks As more evidence is emerging from recent publications on the dangers of occupational radiation exposure in Image (Fluoroscopy) guided interventions there is a clear need to recognize the risks, to learn about staff dose limits and the ways to reduce the possible damage to a Minimum. Recent publications confirm the alarming incidence and variety of occupational-related illnesses of medical staff working in the interventional laboratory (1, 2, 3). International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) issued a new recommendation for the occupational dose limit to the lens of the eye based on the new threshold for lens effects and the suggested equivalent dose limit for the lens of the eye was reduced from 150mSv year-1 (ICRP 2013 Proceedings) to 20mSv year-1, averaged over a 5-year period, with no year's dose exceeding 50mSv (ICRP, 2012). Last International and European BSS (Basic Safety Standards) comprises new limit (European Commission, 2012; IAEA, 2014) for the medical staff (1). Relatively high exposure doses have been reported for both extremities (2) and the eye lens (3, 4) of the Interventional Radiologists (IRs) that in some cases, exceed the personal dose limits. Moreover, new controlled data suggest lower or even no dose threshold for radiation- induced eye lens injuries. These data are under consideration by the ICRP and may lead to the re-evaluation of the existing dose limit (1). There is no ""acceptable dose"" definition or recommendation for the personnel, as it depends on the specific applications and is different for public, workers and patients. There are dose limits for the personnel, which are not applicable to the medical exposure of patients. Noticeably, new dose thresholds, particularly the 0.5 Gy threshold for the lens of the eye, affect occupational protection for operators and other staff, which is principally important for fluoroscopically guided procedures (1, 6). Regrettably, not all operators protect their eyes or their brain sufficiently during interventions. After several years of work without proper protection, cumulative absorbed doses to the lens can exceed 0.5 Gy [ RELID (Retrospective Evaluation of Lens Injuries and Dose) (see: https://rpop.iaea.org/rpop/rpop/content/ news/relid-cataract-study.htm)]. During most of the IAEA surveys of radiation-related lens opacities in interventionalists and staff, 40-50% of the professionals involved in interventional cardiology procedures who volunteered to be examined had posterior subcapsular lens opacities (2, 3, 4). Only 10% of the members of the control groups had such opacities. Important to note that most of the observed lens opacities were in interventionists who had worked for several years without any eye protection. The dose rate to the operator can exceed 10 mSv h-1 when the 'high-dose' fluoroscopy mode is used and 50 mSv h-1 during cine acquisition. The highest dose rate was recorded at the Left Anterior Oblique (LAO 90) projection, which corresponds to the lateral projection when the operator is standing at the tube side (4, 5). Many medical specialties outside the imaging departments (e.g. vascular surgery, urology, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, anaesthetics and pain management) are starting to use or increase their use of fluoroscopically guided procedures in surgical theatres without the radiation protection tools available in standard interventional laboratories (ICRP, 2010). Such a practice may result in occupational doses or these physicians that are higher than the typical values recorded in interventional radiology and cardiology services, where protection tools are used regularly (6). Lack of compliance with the regular use of personal dosimetry has been a problem for many years in many countries (5, 7). This is one of the reasons for the shortage of an accurate occupational dose data (and reliable radiation risk estimations) in different professional groups. One of the methods of estimating staff doses is working on Monte Carlo calculations and detection of staff location in the catheterisation laboratory to calculate approximately staff doses during clinical procedures through the use of radiographic and geometric data. Another method that was recently published is use of a realistic approach to estimate lens doses in interventional cardiology when personal dosimeters are not used regularly. The authors concluded that for around 2000 diagnostic, PCI, and valvular procedures, when the median scatter dose value per procedure at the C-arm was 0.78, 1.07, and 1.45 mSv, respectively (4). Lens doses are approximately 50-60% of these values when radiation protection tools are not used. For all of these procedures, the ratio between the scatter dose at the C-arm and the kerma-area product was 10.3-11.3 mSv(Gy cm2)-1 (6). Several medical societies including CIRSE and SIR have published or endorsed documents on occupational protection that are also expected to improve staff radiation safety (7). New ethical issues are emerging in situations where reducing patient dose involves increasing staff doses and vice versa. Occupational radiological protection is still a challenge in several clinical situations. ICRP has included specific recommendations and advice for occupational protection in most of its publications in recent years (ICRP, 2000, 2007 a,b,c, 2009, 2010, 2013 a,b). Operator dose (incident air kerma) at the typical working position is around 1/1000 of incident air kerma at the patient's skin, so the instantaneous dose rate to an unprotected operator may reach approximately 5mGymin-1. Newer active personal dosimeters display occupational dose rates in real time inside the interventional fluoroscopy suite, and allow subsequent detailed analyses of staff and patient doses by recording dose at very short intervals. This data on implementation of the real time active personnel dosimetry permit the development of new optimisation strategies to improve occupational protection (7, 9).",Excluded

2633,"Dose-painting intensity-modulated proton therapy for intermediate- and high-risk meningioma BACKGROUND: Newly diagnosed WHO grade II-III or any WHO grade recurrent meningioma exhibit an aggressive behavior and thus are considered as high- or intermediate risk tumors. Given the unsatisfactory rates of disease control and survival after primary or adjuvant radiation therapy, optimization of treatment strategies is needed. We investigated the potential of dose-painting intensity-modulated proton beam-therapy (IMPT) for intermediate- and high-risk meningioma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Imaging data from five patients undergoing proton beam-therapy were used. The dose-painting target was defined using [68]Ga-[1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid]- d-Phe(1),Tyr(3)-octreotate ([68]Ga-DOTATATE)-positron emission tomography (PET) in target delineation. IMPT and photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans were generated for each patient using an in-house developed treatment planning system (TPS) supporting spot-scanning technology and a commercial TPS, respectively. Doses of 66 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) and 54 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) were prescribed to the PET-based planning target volume (PTVPET) and the union of PET- and anatomical imaging-based PTV, respectively, in 30 fractions, using simultaneous integrated boost.RESULTS: Dose coverage of the PTVsPET was equally good or slightly better in IMPT plans: dose inhomogeneity was 10 +/- 3% in the IMPT plans vs. 13 +/- 1% in the IMRT plans (p = 0.33). The brain Dmean and brainstem D50 were small in the IMPT plans: 26.5 +/- 1.5 Gy(RBE) and 0.002 +/- 0.0 Gy(RBE), respectively, vs. 29.5 +/- 1.5 Gy (p = 0.001) and 7.5 +/- 11.1 Gy (p = 0.02) for the IMRT plans, respectively. The doses delivered to the optic structures were also decreased with IMPT.CONCLUSIONS: Dose-painting IMPT is technically feasible using currently available planning tools and resulted in dose conformity of the dose-painted target comparable to IMRT with a significant reduction of radiation dose delivered to the brain, brainstem and optic apparatus. Dose escalation with IMPT may improve tumor control and decrease radiation-induced toxicity.",Excluded
3218,"Radiation dose to otologic structures during head and neck cancer radiation therapy BACKGROUND: Otologic structures are often contained within head and neck cancer radiation treatment ports. The dosimetry to otologic structures has not been routinely analyzed and radiation treatment planning does not currently attempt to specifically avoid the inner ear structures when dosimetry is calculated. Recent studies demonstrate that up to 30% of patients experience sensorineural hearing loss on multimodality therapy with cisplatin and radiation.METHODS: In the current case series, radiation dosimetry to otologic structures was calculated from computed tomogram treatment plans on patients. Fifteen nasopharyngeal, oral cavity, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer patients were analyzed.RESULTS: Between 8% and 102% of the total dose is delivered to the petrous bone/cochlea, with 4 of 15 patients getting more than 50% of the dose to at least one cochlea The mastoid air cells received between 3% and 75% of the total dose, with higher doses being delivered to patients with bulky high neck metastases or nasopharyngeal tumors. The eustachian tubes received between 20% and 102% of the total dose, with 10 of 15 patients receiving more than 50% of the dose to this anatomic site.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the cochlea and eustachian tubes receive significant radiation during treatment, particularly in nasopharyngeal cancer patients.

3132,"Contribution of valine 7' of TMD2 to gating of neuronal alpha3 receptor subtypes The second transmembrane domain (TMD2) of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels forms the channel pore. The functional role of the amino acid residues contributing to the channel pore in neuronal nicotinic alpha3 receptors is not well understood. We characterized the contribution of TMD2 position V7' to channel gating in neuronal nicotinic alpha3 receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute position alpha3 (V7') with four different amino acids (A, F, S, or Y) and coexpressed each mutant subunit with wild-type (WT) beta2 or beta4 subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Whole-cell voltage clamp experiments show that substitution for an alanine, serine, or phenylalanine decreased by 2.3-6.2-fold the ACh-EC(50) for alpha3beta2 and alpha3beta4 receptor subtypes. Interestingly, mutation V7'Y did not produce a significant change in ACh-EC(50) when coexpressed with the beta2 subunit but showed a significant approximately two-fold increase with beta4. Similar responses were obtained with nicotine as the agonist. The antagonist sensitivity of the mutant channels was assessed by using dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE) and methyllycaconitine (MLA). The apparent potency of DHbetaE as an antagonist increased by approximately 3.7- and 11-fold for the alpha3beta2 V7'S and V7'F mutants, respectively, whereas no evident changes in antagonist potency were observed for the V7'A and V7'Y mutants. The V7'S and V7'F mutations increase MLA antagonist potency for the alpha3beta4 receptor by approximately 6.2- and approximately 9.3-fold, respectively.

3157,"Myelin repair by Schwann cells in the regenerating goldfish visual pathway: regional patterns revealed by X-irradiation In the regenerating goldfish optic nerves, Schwann cells of unknown origin reliably infiltrate the lesion site forming a band of peripheral-type myelinating tissue by 1-2 months, sharply demarcated from the adjacent new CNS myelin. To investigate this effect, we have interfered with cell proliferation by locally X-irradiating the fish visual pathway 24h after the lesion. As assayed by immunohistochemistry and EM, irradiation retards until 6 months formation of new myelin by Schwann cells at the lesion site, and virtually abolishes oligodendrocyte myelination distally, but has little or no effect on nerve fibre regrowth. Optic nerve astrocyte processes normally fail to re-infiltrate the lesion, but re-occupy it after irradiation, suggesting that they are normally excluded by early cell proliferation at this site. Moreover, scattered myelinating Schwann cells also appear in the oligodendrocyte-depleted distal optic nerve after irradiation, although only as far as the optic tract. Optic nerve reticular astrocytes differ in various ways from radial glia elsewhere in the fish CNS, and our observations suggest that they may be more permissive to Schwann cell invasion of CNS tissue.",Included

3567,"Differential patterning of neuronal, glial and neural progenitor cells on phosphorus-doped and UV irradiated diamond-like carbon Diamond-like carbon (DLC) is an attractive biomaterial for coating human implantable devices. Our particular research interest is in developing DLC as a coating material for implants and electrical devices for the nervous system. We previously reported that DLC is not toxic to N2a neuroblastoma cells or primary cortical neurons and showed that phosphorus-doped DLC (P:DLC) could be used to produce patterned neuron networks. In the present study we complement and extend these findings by exploring patterning of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants, human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) and U-87 astroglioma cells on P:DLC. Further P:DLC data is provided to highlight that P:DLC can be used as an effective coating material for in vitro multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) with potential for patterning groups of neurons on selected electrodes. We also introduce ultraviolet (UV) irradiation as a simple treatment to render DLC neurocompatible. We show that UV:DLC can be used to support patterned and unpatterned cortical neuron growth. These findings strongly support the use of DLC as tailorable and tuneable substrate to study neural cell biology in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that DLC is a well-suited candidate material for coating implantable devices in the human nervous system.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of CTLA-4 inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic melanoma with limited brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Between January 2008 and June 2011, 58 patients with limited brain metastases from melanoma were treated with SRS with a median dose of 20 Gy delivered to the 50% isodose line (range, 15-20 Gy). In 25 patients, ipilimumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg over 90 min every 3 weeks for a median of four doses (range, 1-8). Local control (LC), freedom from new brain metastases, and overall survival (OS) were assessed from the date of the SRS procedure. The median LC, freedom from new brain metastases, and OS for the entire group were 8.7, 4.3, and 5.9 months, respectively. The cause of death was CNS progression in all but eight patients. Six-month LC, freedom from new brain metastases, and OS were 65, 35, and 56%, respectively, for those who received ipilimumab and 63, 47, and 46% for those who did not (P=NS). Intracranial hemorrhage was noted in seven patients who received ipilimumab compared with 10 patients who received SRS alone (P=NS). In this retrospective study, administration of ipilimumab neither increased toxicity nor improved intracerebral disease control in patients with limited brain metastases who received SRS. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

2704,"Extreme retinal remodeling triggered by light damage: implications for age related macular degeneration PURPOSE: Our objective was to comprehensively assess the nature and chronology of neural remodeling in retinal degenerations triggered by light-induced retinal damage (LIRD) in adult albino rodents. Our primary hypothesis is that all complete photoreceptor degenerations devolve to extensive remodeling. An hypothesis emergent from data analysis is that the LIRD model closely mimics late-stage atrophic age relared macular degeneration (AMD).METHODS: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats received intense light exposures of varied durations and survival times ranging from 0 to 240 days. Remodeling was visualized by computational molecular phenotyping (CMP) of a small molecule library: 4-aminobutyrate (gamma), arginine (R), aspartate (D), glutamate (E), glutamine (Q), glutathione (J), glycine (G), and taurine (tau). This library was augmented by probes for key proteins such as rod opsin, cone opsin and cellular retinal binding protein (CRALBP). Quantitative CMP was used to profile 160 eyes from 86 animals in over 6,000 sections.RESULTS: The onset of remodeling in LIRD retinas is rapid, with immediate signs of metabolic stress in photoreceptors, the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the choriocapillaris, and Muller cells. In particular, anomalous elevated aspartate levels appear to be an early stress marker in photoreceptors. After the stress phase, LIRD progresses to focal photoreceptor degeneration within 14 days and extensive remodeling by 60 days. RPE and choriocapillaris losses parallel Muller cell distal seal formation, with progressive neuronal migration, microneuroma evolution, fluid channel formation, and slow neuronal death. The remaining retina in advanced light damage can be classified as survivor, light damage (LD), or decimated zones where massive Muller cell and neuronal emigration into the choroid leaves a retina depleted of neurons and Muller cells. These zones and their transitions closely resemble human geographic atrophy. Across these zones, Muller cells manifest extreme changes in the definitive Muller cell tauQE signature, as well as CRALBP and arginine signals.CONCLUSIONS: LIRD retinas manifest remodeling patterns of genetic retinal degeneration models, but involve no developmental complexities, and are ultimately more aggressive, devastating the remaining neural retina. The decimation of the neural retina via cell emigration through the perforated retina-choroid interface is a serious denouement. If focal remodeling in LIRD accurately profiles late stage atrophic age-related macular degenerations, it augurs poorly for simple molecular interventions. Indeed, the LIRD profile in the SD rat manifests more similarities to advanced human atrophic AMD than most genetically or immunologically induced murine models of AMD.",Excluded
3559,"Patterning the cone mosaic array in zebrafish retina requires specification of ultraviolet-sensitive cones Cone photoreceptors in teleost fish are organized in precise, crystalline arrays in the epithelial plane of the retina. In zebrafish, four distinct morphological/spectral cone types occupy specific, invariant positions within a regular lattice. The cone lattice is aligned orthogonal and parallel to circumference of the retinal hemisphere: it emerges as cones generated in a germinal zone at the retinal periphery are incorporated as single-cell columns into the cone lattice. Genetic disruption of the transcription factor Tbx2b eliminates most of the cone subtype maximally sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths and also perturbs the long-range organization of the cone lattice. In the tbx2b mutant, the other three cone types (red, green, and blue cones) are specified in the correct proportion, differentiate normally, and acquire normal, planar polarized adhesive interactions mediated by Crumbs 2a and Crumbs 2b. Quantitative image analysis of cell adjacency revealed that the cones in the tbx2b mutant primarily have two nearest neighbors and align in single-cell-wide column fragments that are separated by rod photoreceptors. Some UV cones differentiate at the dorsal retinal margin in the tbx2b mutant, although they are severely dysmorphic and are eventually eliminated. Incorporating loss of UV cones during formation of cone columns at the margin into our previously published mathematical model of zebrafish cone mosaic formation (which uses bidirectional interactions between planar cell polarity proteins and anisotropic mechanical stresses in the plane of the retinal epithelium to generate regular columns of cones parallel to the margin) reproduces many features of the pattern disruptions seen in the tbx2b mutant.",Excluded
3060,"The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation over the cerebellum on the synkinesis of coordinated eye and head movements We made a study of coordinated saccadic eye and head movements following random and predictable horizontal visual targets by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the cerebellum before the start of the gaze movement. We have found three effects of TMS on eye/head movements under these conditions. SACCADIC LATENCY-EFFECT: When stimulation took place shortly before movements commenced, significantly shorter latencies were found between target presentation and commencement of saccades: For predictable, to a lesser extent for random targets and TMS up to 75 ms before start of the saccade, latencies were significantly decreased when compared with no application of TMS. Without stimulation, latencies to random targets were within a range of 120-200 ms. EYE-HEAD INTERACTION-EFFECT: Without TMS, for amplitudes greater than 25 degrees, head movements usually preceded eye movements, as expected, especially for predictive responses. With the application of TMS shortly after the target display, the number of eye movements which preceded head movements, was significantly increased (p<0.001), and the delay between eye and head movements was reduced or reversed (p<0.001), compared with gaze movements without the use of TMS. SACCADIC PEAK VELOCITY-EFFECT: Applying transcranial magnetic stimulation at 5-25 ms after the position change of the 60 degrees target, and 50-5 s before the start of eye movement, mean peak velocity of synkinetic saccades increased up to 600 degrees/s, compared with 350-400 degrees/s without the use of TMS. We conclude that transient functional cerebellar deficits caused by the application of TMS can change the central synkinesis of eye-head coordination.",Excluded
3468,"Disorder in Pixel-Level Edge Directions on T1WI Is Associated with the Degree of Radiation Necrosis in Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors: Preliminary Findings BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Co-occurrence of local anisotropic gradient orientations (COLLAGE) is a recently developed radiomic (computer extracted) feature that captures entropy (measures the degree of disorder) in pixel-level edge directions and was previously shown to distinguish predominant cerebral radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor on gadolinium-contrast T1WI. In this work, we sought to investigate whether COLLAGE measurements from posttreatment gadolinium-contrast T1WI could distinguish varying extents of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor classes in a lesion across primary and metastatic brain tumors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: On a total of 75 gadolinium-contrast T1WI studies obtained from patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the extent of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor in every brain lesion was histopathologically defined by an expert neuropathologist as the following: 1) ""pure"" cerebral radiation necrosis; 2) ""mixed"" pathology with coexistence of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumors; 3) ""predominant"" (>80%) cerebral radiation necrosis; 4) predominant (>80%) recurrent tumor; and 5) pure tumor. COLLAGE features were extracted from the expert-annotated ROIs on MR imaging. Statistical comparisons of COLLAGE measurements using first-order statistics were performed across pure, mixed, and predominant pathologies of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.RESULTS: COLLAGE features exhibited decreased skewness for patients with pure (0.15 +/- 0.12) and predominant cerebral radiation necrosis (0.25 +/- 0.09) and were statistically significantly different (P < .05) from those in patients with predominant recurrent tumors, which had highly skewed (0.42 +/- 0.21) COLLAGE values. COLLAGE values for the mixed pathology studies were found to lie between predominant cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor categories.CONCLUSIONS: With additional independent multisite validation, COLLAGE measurements might enable noninvasive characterization of the degree of recurrent tumor or cerebral radiation necrosis in gadolinium-contrast T1WI of posttreatment lesions.",Excluded

This case is well reproduced by ex-vivo samples of 90<sup>Y</sup>-marked Gastro-Entero-Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (GEP NET) in the bowel. These specimens indeed include at least three wide independent sources of background associated to three anatomical districts (mesentery, intestine, mucose). The study is based on the analysis of 37 lesions found on 5 samples belonging to 5 different patients. We show that the use of electrons, a short range particle, instead of gamma particles, allows to limit counts read on a lesion to the sum of the tumor signal plus the background generated by the sole hosting district. The background on adjacent districts in the same specimen/patient is found to differ up to a factor 4, showing how the specificity and sensitivity of the beta<sup>-</sup>-RGS technique can be fully exploited only upon a correct measurement of the contributing background. This locality has been used to set a site-specific cut-off algorithm to discriminate tumor and healthy tissue with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity, on this test data sample, close to 100%. Factors influencing the sensitivity are also discussed. One of the specimens set allowed us evaluate the volume of the lesions, thus concluding that the probe was able to detect lesions as small as 0.04mL in that particular case.",Excluded

In the flow rats, the absolute mass of postural muscles remained unchanged while their relative mass increased; this may be attributed to their enhanced hydration which developed during the first 2 days after landing.

[French] Purpose. - To identify SF2 as a prognostic factor of late complications from radiosurgery in patients treated for AVM. Patients and Methods. - Five patients with AVM treated in three canadian institutions and who suffered clinically significant neurological sequelaes secondary to radiosurgery were identified. Their fibroblasts were cultured and their radiation sensitivity tested to determine the SF2 for each patient. Results. - Patients who developed a neurological complication from radionecrosis, secondary to radiosurgery had an SF2 different than the two control patients with AVM and no complications and also from a group of five cancer patients without late radiation complications (P = 0.005). Conclusion. - Radiosurgery is an elective procedure. The identification of a subgroup of patients who are radiosensitive and at a higher risk of radiation induced complications can allow the treatment team to reduce the risk of such complications. SF2 as a new predictive factor should be incorporated in predictive models of risk from treatment of AVM by radiosurgery.

2762,"Prediction of an oxygen extraction fraction map by convolutional neural network: validation of input data among MR and PET images PURPOSE: Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) is a biomarker for the viability of brain tissue in ischemic stroke. However, acquisition of the OEF map using positron emission tomography (PET) with oxygen-15 gas is uncomfortable for patients because of the long fixation time, invasive arterial sampling, and radiation exposure. We aimed to predict the OEF map from magnetic resonance (MR) and PET images using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and to demonstrate which PET and MR images are optimal as inputs for the prediction of OEF maps.METHODS: Cerebral blood flow at rest (CBF) and during stress (sCBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps acquired from oxygen-15 PET, and routine MR images (T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted images) for 113 patients with steno-occlusive disease were learned with U-Net. MR and PET images acquired from the other 25 patients were used as test data. We compared the predicted OEF maps and intraclass correlation (ICC) with the real OEF values among combinations of MRI, CBF, CBV, and sCBF.RESULTS: Among the combinations of input images, OEF maps predicted by the model learned with MRI, CBF, CBV, and sCBF maps were the most similar to the real OEF maps (ICC: 0.597 +/- 0.082). However, the contrast of predicted OEF maps was lower than that of real OEF maps.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the deep CNN learned useful features from CBF, sCBF, CBV, and MR images and predict qualitatively realistic OEF maps. These findings suggest that the deep CNN model can shorten the fixation time for <sup>15</sup>O PET by skipping <sup>15</sup>O<sub>2</sub> scans.

3107,"Oxytocin actions within the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei: differential effects on peripheral and intranuclear vasopressin release In response to forced swimming (FS), AVP is released somato-dendritically within the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN), but not from neurohypophyseal terminals into blood. Together with AVP, oxytocin (OXT) is released within the SON and PVN. Here, we studied the role of intra-SON and intra-PVN OXT in the regulation of local AVP release and into the blood in male rats. Within the SON, bilateral retrodialysis of an OXT receptor antagonist (OXT-A) increased local AVP release in response to FS [60 s, 21 degrees C, vehicle twofold, not significant (ns); OXT-A: 15-fold increase, P < 0.05] without significantly affecting basal AVP release. In addition, local OXT-A elevated plasma AVP secretion under basal conditions (twofold increase, P < 0.05) without further elevation after FS. Within the PVN, exposure to FS elevated local AVP release, reaching significance only in the OXT-A group (vehicle: 1.4-fold, ns; OXT-A: 1.6-fold increase, P = 0.050). Bilateral OXT-A into the PVN did not affect peripheral AVP secretion either under basal or stress conditions. Basal ACTH concentrations tended to be elevated by local OXT-A within the PVN (1.7-fold increase, P = 0.076). In contrast, the swim-induced ACTH secretion was attenuated after retrodialysis of OXT-A within both the SON (at 5 min) and PVN (at 15 min) (P < 0.05 both) compared with vehicle. The results demonstrate a receptor-mediated effect of OXT within the SON and PVN on local and neurohypophyseal AVP release, which depends upon the activity conditions. Further, while exerting an inhibitory effect on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity under basal conditions, hypothalamic OXT is essential for an adequate acute ACTH response.",Excluded
2583,"A clonogenic survival assay of neural stem cells in rat spinal cord after exposure to ionizing radiation Neural stem cells play an important role in neurogenesis of the adult central nervous system (CNS). Inhibition of neurogenesis has been suggested to be an underlying mechanism of radiation-induced CNS damage. Here we developed an in vivo/ in vitro clonogenic assay to characterize the survival of neural stem cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Cells were isolated from the rat cervical spinal cord and plated as single cell suspensions in defined medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The survival of the proliferating cells was determined by their ability to form neurosphere colonies. The number and size of neurospheres were analyzed quantitatively at day 10, 12, 14 and 16 after plating. Plating cells from 5, 10 and 15 mm of the cervical spinal cord resulted in a linear increase in the number of neurospheres from day 10-16. Compared to the nonirradiated spinal cord, there was a significant decrease in the number and size of neurosphere colonies cultured from a 10-mm length of the rat spinal cord after a single dose of 5 Gy. When dissociated neurospheres derived from a spinal cord that had been irradiated with 5 Gy were allowed to differentiate, the percentages of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as determined by immunocytohistochemistry were not altered compared to those from the nonirradiated spinal cord. Secondary neurospheres could be obtained from cells dissociated from primary neurospheres that had been cultured from the irradiated spinal cord. In conclusion, exposure to ionizing radiation reduces the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells cultured from the rat spinal cord. However, neural stem cells retain their pluripotent and self-renewing properties after irradiation. A neurosphere-based assay may provide a quantitative measure of the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells in the adult CNS after irradiation.",Included
2798,"Hepatic iron loading and oxidative stress in ataxia-telangiectasia mice Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in a myriad of abnormalities including progressive neurodegeneration, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to ionising radiation. At a cellular level A-T is a disease of chronic oxidative stress (OS) resulting from reduced antioxidant defence capacity leading to the oxidative damage of proteins, lipids, and DNA. Transition metals such as Fe<sup>2/+</sup> act as pro-oxidative molecules, catalysing the conversion of weakly reactive oxygen species such as H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, causing significant oxidative damage. Cellular iron accumulation and the resultant OS has also been linked to the neurodegeneration seen in Alzheimer0s and Parkinson's diseases, lymphoid tumours (which occur in approximately 30% of A-T patients), and ionising radiation hypersensitivity. To investigate iron regulation in A-T, iron indices, iron regulatory gene expression, and markers of oxidative stress were studied in livers of wild-type and Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm) null mice on a control diet and when challenged with a high iron diet. At 10 weeks of age, Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice on a control diet had increased serum iron, hepatic iron and ferritin, with significantly up-regulated hepcidin (Hamp1) expression compared to wild-type mice. When challenged with the high iron diet Bone morphogenetic protein 6, Hfe, and Ferroportin were all significantly up-regulated in Atm<sup>-/-</sup> compared to wild-type mice. Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice also had significantly higher hepatic OS that increased disproportionately in animals fed the high iron diet. In summary, we have demonstrated that Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice have a propensity to accumulate iron in spite of the appropriate regulation of genes involved in iron homeostasis. The increased hepatic iron in Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice is associated with a disproportionately large increase in hepatic OS. Our results suggest that increased iron status may contribute to the chronic OS seen in A-T patients.",Excluded
2608,"Preservation of cognitive function following whole brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases: Complications, treatments, and the emerging role of memantine Whole brain radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients suffering from stage IV malignancies that have metastasized to the brain. Although this therapy is often effective at reducing tumor size and burden, it is associated with a spectrum of toxicities that often result in irreversible cognitive decline. Various drug and non-drug therapies have been evaluated to treat this neurotoxicity after whole brain radiotherapy is administered; however, currently available options have shown little benefit or come with side effects themselves that may outweigh the benefits of their use. For this reason, current investigations are focusing on preventing cognitive decline, rather than attempting to attenuate symptoms after they occur. Memantine has consistently shown promise in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies as a neuroprotective agent that may improve cognitive outcomes in patients undergoing whole brain radiotherapy. Memantine use prior to and during whole brain radiotherapy has been shown to significantly delay time to cognitive failure and reduce the rate of decline in memory, cognitive function, and processing speed. Its use has also been linked to significant decreases in brain edema, brain infarct size, and brain vasculature changes following whole brain radiotherapy. Memantine offers a promising safety profile with high tolerability and limited side effects.

Animals were exposed to wave-bands of light centered at the peak of rhodopsin absorbance (green, 500 nm) or in the ultraviolet A (UVA; 360 nm). Intensity-damage curves generated for each wave-band indicated that UVA light was 50-80 times more effective than green light at causing photoreceptor cell losses. Examination of early ultrastructural changes in rod inner segments, outer segments, and retinal pigment epithelium revealed a remarkable degree of similarity between UVA and green light-induced damage. Furthermore, the two classes of damage were indistinguishable in terms of post-exposure recovery from threshold damage and regional distribution of photoreceptor cell loss along the vertical meridian. The finding of essentially identical histologic manifestations for the two classes of damage raises the possibility that they share a common biochemical etiology or pathway of cell destruction.",Excluded

3430,"Physics of surgery with lasers The characteristics of the principal lasers used in surgery are summarized in Table 1. Their diverse effects on biologic tissues permit the following generalizations: The CO2 laser is best suited for precise, visually controllable tissue removal by vaporization with minimal marginal damage. Hemostasis is excellent for bleeding from capillary vessels, but difficult for larger ones. The Nd:YAG laser is best suited for the coagulation of larger tissue volumes of the order of 10 mm3 or more. Tissue heating inherently extends for several millimeters, leading to excellent hemostasis. Radiation from this laser is well transmitted through flexible optical fibers and clear fluids. The argon ion laser emits radiation in the visible range and is ideally suited for treating the retina and other tissues in the eye without damage to its transparent structures. Radiation of this laser is strongly absorbed by pigmented tissues, scattered and reflected by others, and transmitted by fluids. Its radiation can be focused to very small spot sizes, leading to high precision and high-power densities. It has hemostatic properties intermediate between those of the CO2 and of the Nd:YAG laser radiations. It is well transmitted through optical fibers and clear fluids. It is used extensively in ophthalmology and dermatology. Selected applications to neurosurgery and otology are being investigated. These lasers have become indispensable adjuncts to the surgical armamentarium of several specialties. The very success of these lasers is leading to a critical examination of their shortcomings and to a search for improved systems. Examples are (1) the ongoing search for optical fibers to transmit the radiation of the CO2 laser; (2) the development of systems for the sequential delivery to tissues of several wavelengths from a single unit (Fig. 14); and (3) investigations of tissue effects of laser beams in the ultraviolet and in the infrared at wavelengths intermediate between those of the Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers. The use of lasers has already contributed to improved medical care in many surgical disciplines. Additional areas of application can be confidently anticipated.",Excluded

2403,"The role played by SLUG, an epithelialmesenchymal transition factor, in invasion and therapeutic resistance of malignant glioma Purpose: In malignant gliomas, invasive phenotype and cancer stemness promoting resurgence of residual tumor cells, render treatment very difficult. Hence, identification of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors associated with invasion and stemness of glioma cells is critical. Method(s): To address the issue, we investigated several EMT factors in hypermotile U87MG and U251 cells, mouse xenograft model, and human glioma samples. Of several EMT markers, SLUG expression was notably increased at the invasive fronts of gliomas, both in mouse tumor xenografts and human glioma samples. The biological role played by SLUG was investigated using a colony-forming assay after chemotherapy and irradiation, and by employing a neurosphere culture assay. The effect of SLUG on glioma progression was examined in our patient cohort and samples, and compared to large public data from the REMBRANDT and TCGA. Result(s): Genetic upregulation of SLUG was associated with increased levels of stemness factors and enhanced resistance to radiation and temozolomide. In our cohort, patients exhibiting lower-level SLUG expression evidenced longer progression-free survival (P=0.042). Also, in the REMBRANDT dataset, a group in which SLUG was downregulated exhibited a significant survival benefit (P<0.001). Although paired gliblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples from our patients did not showed significant increase of SLUG expression, increased mRNA levels of SLUG was found in recurred GBM from TCGA (P=0.052), and in TMZ-treated glioma cells and mouse xenograft.

An increase in the number of Fos-protein-positive cells in vestibular (especially medial and spinal) regions was observed 1 day after launch and 1 day after landing. Fos-positive cell numbers were no different from controls 12 days after launch or 14 days after landing. No G-related changes in IEG expression were observed in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pattern of FRA protein expression was generally similar to that of Fos, except at 1 day after landing, when FRA-expressing cells were observed throughout the whole spinal vestibular nucleus, but only in the caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus. Fos expression was found throughout the entire medial vestibular nucleus at this time. While both Fos and FRA expression patterns may reflect the increased G force experienced during take-off and landing, the Fos pattern may additionally reflect recent rebound episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep following forced wakefulness, especially after landing. Pontine activity sources producing rhythmic discharges of vestibulo-oculomotor neurons during REM sleep could substitute for labyrinthine signals after exposure to microgravity, contributing to activity-related plastic changes leading to G readaptation. Reticular structures exhibited a contrasting pattern of changes in the numbers of Fos- and FRA-positive cells suggestive of a major influence from proprioceptive inputs, and plastic re-weighting of inputs after landing. Asymmetric induction of Fos and FRAs observed in some vestibular nuclei 1 day after landing suggests that activity asymmetries between bilateral otolith organs, their primary labyrinthine afferents, and vestibular nuclei may become unmasked during flight.",Included
2864,"Increased activity and involvement of caspase-3 in radiation-induced apoptosis in neural cells precursors from developing rat brain Using primary cultures of neural precursor cells of cortex from developing rat brain, we demonstrated the involvement of caspase-3 in the apoptotic process induced by gamma irradiation. The precursor nature of cells was confirmed by nestin and GFAP immunoreactivity and by the capacity of differentiation in neuronal and glial cells after 5 days in culture. Neural precursors were irradiated with single doses ranging from 0.1 to 4Gy. Cellular death, determined 24 h post-irradiation (pi) was dose-dependent and the induction of apoptosis was confirmed by nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and hypodiploid DNA peak represented by the ""sub G1"" region. For the higher doses, apoptosis was evident after 4-6 h pi and increased during 24 h. Caspase-3 activity increased with doses and was maximal at 4-6 h pi with 3Gy and remained similar with 4Gy. The protection from radiation-induced apoptosis by caspase-3 inhibitor, zDEVD-fmk, confirmed that this enzyme is involved in the apoptotic mechanism in this system. The possibility of using this tissue culture system for studying the effects of ionizing radiation on morphological and molecular differentiation was considered.",Excluded
2891,"Outcomes in lung cancer patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit Learning Objectives: Cancer survival rates continue to improve due to improvement in surgical techniques and combined therapies but multiple studies have shown poor outcome in cancer patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU). Our study specifically looked at the outcome in lung cancer patients. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated patients with lung cancer on active chemotherapy in past 6 months who were admitted to the ICU from 2011-2016. Out of 250, 80 patients met the inclusion criteria. Result(s): The mean patient age was 69 with 48% males. Majority cancer type was non-small cell lung cancer(55%)and squamous cell cancer(29%). 60% patients were stage 4 and 40% patients were combined stages 1-3. 50% had local lung metastasis followed by 19%, 18% and 11% brain, bone and liver metastasis, respectively. Besides chemotherapy,24% had prior surgery and 45% had radiation for treatment.18% were admitted due to cancer progression (CP), 64% due to reversible cancer complications (RCC), and 19 % due to therapy complications (TC). Most common admitting diagnoses were: hypoxic respiratory failure (32, 40%) and sepsis (19,24%). The median ICU length of stay was 4 days. In ICU, 35 patients (44%) had ventilator dependent respiratory failure (VDRF), 42 (52%) had sepsis, 46 (57%) had renal failure (RF), 11 (14%) had liver failure(LF), 10 (12%) had pancytopenia. 18 patients (22%) were DNR at ICU admission and 62 (78%) were full code. Only 6 patients (7.5%) had palliative goals of care before ICU admission. In-hospital mortality (IHM) was 19 patients (24%) overall, and highest in those with cardiac failure(50%, p = .008),VDRF(43%,p = 0.002),followed by sepsis (40.4%,p = 0.004), and pancytopenia 40%,p = 0.16). IHM was 21% in pts with CP, 25% in patients with a RCC and 20% in pts with a TC. After discharge, 35 patients (58.3%) went back on Rx and 23 (38.3%) chose hospice. After discharge, 18% were dead at 30 days, 28% at 90-days. Only 49% had more than one year survival.

2614,"The medial septum mediates impairment of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle induced by a hippocampal seizure or phencyclidine The involvement of the septohippocampal system on the impaired sensorimotor gating induced by phencyclidine (PCP) or by an electrically induced hippocampal seizure was examined in behaving rats. An impaired sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, was observed following a hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) or systemic injection of PCP and was accompanied with an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30-70 Hz). The medial septum infusion with muscimol (0.25 microg), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, 15 min prior to PCP or a hippocampal AD, prevented the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in gamma waves. By itself, muscimol (0.25 microg) injection into the medial septum did not affect PPI, although it significantly suppressed spontaneous gamma waves. In order to identify subpopulations of neurons mediating the sensorimotor gating deficit and the hippocampal gamma wave increase, 0.14-0.21 microg of p75 antibody conjugated to saporin (192 IgG-saporin) was injected into the medial septum to selectively lesion the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Neither the PPI deficit nor the gamma wave increase induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD was affected by 192 IgG-saporin lesion of the medial septum. It is concluded that increase in neural activity in the medial septum participates in the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD. It is suggested that the GABAergic but not the cholinergic septohippocampal neurons mediate the sensorimotor gating deficit.",Excluded

Reactive oxygen species are implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders because of higher vulnerability of neuronal tissues. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the role of melatonin against high-LET (linear energy transfer) (56)Fe particle irradiation-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the mouse cerebellum. Radiation-induced oxidative damage was examined using a neuronal-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL), quantitative histopathology, DNA damage (comet assay), carbonyl content and 4-HAE + MDA (4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde) status of the cerebellum. Radiation exposure augmented the number of TUNEL positive cell, DNA migration in the comet tail and carbonyl and 4-HAE + MDA level in the cerebellum. Melatonin pretreatment significantly inhibited the oxidative damage to biomolecules as well as cerebellar apoptosis. Melatonin-treated irradiated mice showed higher counts of intact Purkinje cells as compared to vehicle-treated irradiated mice. In addition, radiation induced augmentation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and a decline in the total antioxidant capacity in serum; these changes were also ameliorated by melatonin pretreatment. The present results provide evidence supporting the antioxidant and neuroprotective function of melatonin.",Included

This U.S. National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) analysis was performed to improve the evidence guiding decision-making regarding postoperative therapy for early stage LCNEC. Method(s): Overall survival of patients with pathologic T1-2aN0 LCNEC who underwent resection in the NCDB from 2003 to 2015 was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis. Patients who died within 30 days of surgery were excluded. These prospective data were acquired by certified tumor registrars, and include over 80% of cancer diagnoses annually in the U.S. Result(s): Of the 5,177 patients who met study criteria, adjuvant therapy was given to 31% of patients (n=1585): 20% received chemotherapy (n=1039), 8% chemoradiation (n=400), and 3% radiation (n=146). In stage IA LCNEC, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival when compared to no adjuvant therapy in unadjusted analysis (five-year survival 55% vs. 53%; p=0.03) but not after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.02). Of note, adjuvant chemoradiation (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.48) and adjuvant radiation (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.25) were associated with worse survival when compared to no adjuvant therapy. In stage IB LCNEC, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival when compared with no adjuvant therapy in both univariate (five-year survival 60% vs. 43%; p<0.0001; Figure) and multivariable (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.88) analyses.

2941,"Prospective study of fatigue in localized prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy The objectives were to (1) prospectively evaluate fatigue utilizing validated instruments in patients with localized prostate cancer, and (2) examine the relationships between fatigue, depression, quality of life, and sleep disturbance. The instruments used included: Piper Fatigue Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate Scale. Data on cancer stage, prostate specific antigen levels, hematocrit, patient's body weight and radiation dosage were recorded. Patients were evaluated preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy, and at 4-5 weeks follow-up. Thirty-six veterans with localized prostate cancer were studied. Mean age was 66.9 years (range 55-79). Duration of treatment was 7-8 weeks. Univariate procedure and Wilcoxon Signed Rank-test were used to examine changes in pretreatment scores for each of the three subsequent study periods. To adjust for multiple comparisons Bonferroni test was used. Spearman Correlations were calculated among parameters. No significant changes were noted in mean scores of hematocrit and body weight during the study period. On the Piper Fatigue Scale, adjusted for multiple comparisons, the median scores were significantly higher at completion of radiotherapy as compared with preradiotherapy values. Three patients (8%) were experienced fatigue according to Piper Fatigue Scale before treatment as compared to nine patients (25%) at completion of radiotherapy. On Prostate Cancer Specific and Physical Well Being subscales of the Functional Assessment for Prostate Cancer Therapy, the scores were significantly lower at middle and completion of radiotherapy than at pretreatment. At preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy and follow-up evaluation, patients scoring higher on the Piper Fatigue Scale were more likely to report a poorer quality of Physical Well Being on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostates. No significant changes were noted in the Beck Depression Inventory and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores during treatment. Eight patients scored 10 or more on the Beck Depression Inventory before starting radiotherapy, suggesting depressive symptomatology. Of these, only seven patients scored 10 or more at completion of treatment. The incidence of fatigue is lower in our study than in previously published data. A relationship exists between fatigue scores and physical well being subscale scores. Higher scores on the Piper Fatigue Scale at the completion of radiotherapy, as well as no changes on depression and sleepiness scales, suggest that fatigue may not be the result of depression or sleep disturbance. Based upon our previous work, we propose that the physical expression of fatigue may be secondary to a decline in neuromuscular efficiency and enhanced muscle fatigue.",Excluded
3473,"Steroid responsive migratory brain lesions causing intractable epilepsy in multiple myeloma Objective: Description of a patient with multiple myeloma presenting with intractable epilepsy, steroid responsive, and recurrent abnormal T2 signal on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Background(s): Paraneoplastic epilepsy has been described in association with multiple malignancies and has been related to the presence of various antibodies, and/or malignancy spread to the central nervous system (CNS). Here we describe a unique presentation of refractory epilepsy associated with steroid responsive CNS lesions in the setting of multiple myeloma. Design/Methods: N/A Results: A 64 year old man presented with episodic expressive aphasia. His medical history was significant for IgA Kappa multiple myeloma with metastases to the spine since 2013; treated with radiation, chemotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. MRI showed abnormal T2 hyperintense signal on juxtacortical white matter and cortex with no restricted diffusion or contrast enhancement. Seizures seen on EEG were treated. Paraneoplastic, infectious, and malignancy work up was negative, except for >5 oligoclonal bands in serum and CSF suggesting systemic inflammation with secondary CNS involvement. Two weeks later the symptoms reoccurred. MRI showed progression and intravenous solumedrol (IVSM) treatment lead to clinical and radiological improvement. Follow up MRI four months later showed resolution of findings. However, a few weeks later, he presented with status epilepticus (SE). MRI showed multiple new lesions; he received IVSM, which provided a satisfactory response. He was discharged on prednisone. MRI two months later showed marked improvement and prednisone was reduced to 20mg/day. In July, symptoms reoccurred so he was treated again for SE and his MRI showed extensive new lesions. Despite aggressive treatment with anticonvulsants, IVSM and intravenous immunoglobulin, clinical, electrographic and radiographic progression persisted. Family opted for comfort care.

Contents of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma and IL-4 in serum were measured and changes of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoid (GC) in serum were analyzed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunologic assay, respectively at different time points post wound and radiation.RESULTS: (1) The level of IFN-gamma, one of the Th1 cell cytokines increased significantly at 14 d post CWR, which was markedly higher than that in control group and wound group. However, the level of IL-4, IL-1beta and IL-6, one of the Th2 cell cytokines, did not show obvious change. (2) Ratio of Th1/Th2 (IFN-gamma/IL-4) in wound group and CWR group increased significantly at 7 d after wound and radiation, which suggested that Th1/Th2 balance drifted to Th1 immune response. The ratio of Th1/Th2 in wound group returned to the normal level up to 14 d after the wound and radiation, while the Th1/Th2 ratio in CWR group increased persistently and was much higher than that in control and wound groups. (3) Level of serous ACTH and GC in CWR group increased at 3 d post wound and radiation, and among them, level of GC showed statistically significant increase, which was much higher than that in control and wound groups.CONCLUSION: Level of serous neurohormone GC in rats increased significantly immediately after wound and radiation; while the level of IFN-gamma showed significant increase only up to 14 d after wound and radiation, and the Th1/Th2 imbalance sustained till 28 d post wound and radiation. In order to reduce acute damage caused by CWR, organic immune system and nerve system showed up a marked regulate effects simultaneously and mutually. Nonetheless, the excessive stress induced by CWR causes disturbance of immunoregulation, which is one of the key reasons for delayed wound healing in CWR.",Included

2962,"Devastating complications after brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate adenocarcinoma OBJECTIVE: To report a retrospective chart review of patients who developed recto-urethral fistula (RUF) or several bladder neck contracture (BNC) recurrences after brachytherapy for treating localized prostate cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the past 3 years 18 patients with devastating complications after prostate brachytherapy were referred to our centre (RUF in 11, BNC in seven; mean age 63 years, range 60-81). All patients with RUF initially underwent diverting colostomy (six cystoprostatectomy with closure of the fistula, omental interposition and urinary diversion; one prostatectomy, bladder neck closure, fistula closure with omentum flap and continent vesicostomy). Three patients had the fistula closed with gracilis muscle flap using the York-Mason approach (one had a bladder neck closure and suprapubic tube; one elected to have no treatment). All patients with BNC had received three or more procedures to resect or incise their contracture. Four had diversion with a catheterizable segment, two used an indwelling Foley catheter and one uses intermittent catheterization.RESULTS: All six patients who had cystoprostatectomy with urinary diversion have had no recurrence of their RUF. All three treated with the York-Mason procedure healed well. One developed recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma and two a secondary neoplasia in the prostate or rectum (leiomyosarcoma and neuroendocrine, respectively). The enterocystoplasty patient developed sepsis after colostomy reversal and subsequently died. In those patients with BNC, the four who underwent urinary diversion fared well; two tolerate the indwelling catheter poorly, and the seventh uses intermittent catheterization with occasional difficulty.CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy with or without external irradiation can be associated with severe complications. RUF managed with aggressive anterior pelvic exenteration and urinary diversion can be associated with excellent results. The York-Mason procedure in patients with an adequate urinary continence mechanism and bladder dynamics may provide good functional results. The presence of a secondary malignancy in patients deserves further investigation. Many recurrences of a BNC tend be refractory to transurethral resection/incision; indwelling catheters are then poorly tolerated and patients may require a major reconstructive procedure.",Excluded

The occurrence of lymphocytopenia depends on the body site of radiotherapy; it is most pronounced with pelvic irradiation, whereas the effect of brain irradiation on the lymphocyte count is to be elucidated. This preliminary study was performed to evaluate changes in lymphocyte number occurring during brain irradiation in cancer patients with brain metastases. The study included 50 patients who received brain radiotherapy for single or multiple brain metastases at a total dose of 30 Gy. Overall, no significant changes in mean lymphocyte number occurred during brain radiotherapy. However, when lymphocyte variations were assessed in relation to the clinical response of brain metastases, a significant increase in the mean number of lymphocytes was found in patients who achieved objective regression of brain metastases on brain irradiation. The mean lymphocyte number decreased in nonresponding patients, albeit without a statistically significant difference with respect to the pretreatment values. The results of this study show that the efficacy of radiotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is associated with a significant increase in mean lymphocyte number. Therefore, evidence of brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis may predict the efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded

Adult onset is rare, however probably underdiagnosed. Brain MRI showing a leukodystrophy is of great value to achieve diagnosis. We aimed at performing for the first time a systematic analysis of brainMRI features in adult onset Krabbe disease (>10 years old). Method(s): We collected the first available brain MRI of patients seen in the reference center for lysosomal diseases. We also contacted authors of published articles describing adult onset Krabbe disease patients and ask them to share brain MRI data. A score was established to describe the brain MRIs, with quantification according to severity (from 0 to 4 for nonfascicular structures and from 0 to 2 for fascicular structures). Two neuroradiologists first scored separately the MRIs, then reached a consensus for final scoring. Result(s): Thirteen patients were included in the study. Pyramidal tract was the most frequent structure showing abnormal T2 hypersignal (100% of patients), however with some distinctions along the tractus: medial precentral gyrus (100% of patients, mean score 2.8/4), lateral precentral gyrus (77%, 1.77/4), and corona radiata (100%, 1.7/2) were highly abnormal whereas internal capsula (69%, 0.96/2), mesencephalon (46%, 0.69/2), pons (31%, 0.42/2), and spinal bulb (0%, 0/2) were quite spared. Other sus tentorial white matter (WM) localizations were also found abnormal: occipital WM (92%, 2.15/ 4), optic radiations (69%, mean score 1.03/2), frontalWM(69%, 1.5/4), temporal WM (61%, 1.15/4), and parietal WM (15%, 0.23/4). 9/13 patients (69%) had corpus callosum hypersignal especially in isthmus (69%, mean score 1.38/2), body (38%, 0.77/2), and splenium (31%, 0.61/2), whereas genu was always normal.

3589,"Cellular response of meningioma towards retinoid acid and ionizing radiation Meningiomas are the second most common primary brain tumors and represent one-third of all primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. Currently, most meninigiomas are effectively managed via surgical resection. Recurrent meningiomas and unresectable, residual tumors after partial resection are treated with radiation. However, patients who are not suitable for surgery or radiation therapy or whose tumors recur after such treatment have limited therapeutic options. Retinoids are a class of compounds structurally related to vitamin A. Retinoic acid (RA) has been widely used to treat dermatological disease. Recently, RA, the active derivative of vitamin A and the first candidate diffusible morphogen in vertebrates, was used as a potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agent. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of RA on meningiomas when administered in combinination with ionizing radiation. The early data showed that both all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 13-cis-retinoic aciecan inhibited cell proliferation at high concentrations (10 mM) but had little cell proliferation inhibition activity at low concentrations (10 nM and 1 mM, respectively), thereby implicating the role of RA in meningioma clinical treatment. Neither ATRA nor 13-cis-RA influenced cell cycle progression. Further study showed that 10-mM ATRA exposure led to increased cell death after irradiation; however, 10-nM or 1-mMATRA pretreatment enhanced meningioma cell survival following irradiation. Comet assay showed that RA reduced the G2/M phase arrest caused by irradiation, thereby suggesting that DNA repair processes are involved in the activity of RA when combined with radiation.",Excluded

2618,"Quetiapine attenuates cognitive impairment and decreases seizure susceptibility possibly through promoting myelin development in a rat model of malformations of cortical development Developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and refractory epilepsy are the most frequent consequences found in patients suffering from malformations of cortical development (MCD). However, therapeutic options for these psychiatric and neurological comorbidities are currently limited. The development of white matter undergoes dramatic changes during postnatal brain maturation, thus myelination deficits resulting from MCD contribute to its comorbid diseases. Consequently, drugs specifically targeting white matter are a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of MCD. We have used an in utero irradiation rat model of MCD to investigate the effects of postnatal quetiapine treatment on brain myelination as well as neuropsychological and cognitive performances and seizure susceptibility. Fatally irradiated rats were treated with quetiapine (10mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P30. We found that postnatal administration of quetiapine attenuated object recognition memory impairment and improved long-term spatial memory in the irradiated rats. Quetiapine treatment also reduced the susceptibility and severity of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Importantly, quetiapine treatment resulted in an inhibition of irradiation-induced myelin breakdown in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum. These findings suggest that quetiapine may have beneficial, postnatal effects in the irradiated rats, strongly suggesting that improving MCD-derived white matter pathology is a possible underlying mechanism. Collectively, these results indicate that brain myelination represents an encouraging pharmacological target to improve the prognosis of patients with MCD.",Excluded

3223,"The involvement of ATF4 and S-opsin in retinal photoreceptor cell damage induced by blue LED light PURPOSE: Blue light is a high-energy emitting light with a short wavelength in the visible light spectrum. Blue light induces photoreceptor apoptosis and causes age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. In the present study, we investigated the roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by blue light-emitting diode (LED) light exposure in murine photoreceptor cells.METHODS: The murine photoreceptor cell line was incubated and exposed to blue LED light (464 nm blue LED light, 450 lx, 3 to 24 h). The expression of the factors involved in the unfolded protein response pathway was examined using quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblot analysis. The aggregation of short-wavelength opsin (S-opsin) in the murine photoreceptor cells was observed with immunostaining. The effect of S-opsin knockdown on ATF4 expression in the murine photoreceptor cell line was also investigated.RESULTS: Exposure to blue LED light increased the bip, atf4, and grp94 mRNA levels, induced the expression of ATF4 protein, and increased the levels of ubiquitinated proteins. Exposure to blue LED light in combination with ER stress inducers (tunicamycin and dithiothreitol) induced the aggregation of S-opsin. S-opsin mRNA knockdown prevented the induction of ATF4 expression in response to exposure to blue LED light.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the aggregation of S-opsin induced by exposure to blue LED light causes ER stress, and ATF4 activation in particular.",Excluded
3511,"Thymoquinone induces cell killing in glioblastoma cells through generation of DNA damage and cell cycle arrest Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common type of brain tumor in humans. Surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy is the current standard treatment; however, due to the upregulation of several survival pathways, tumor recurrence is quite common with a median survival of 12 to 15 months. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of glioblastoma. Naturally occurring phytochemicals have steadily received much scientific attention, owing to the fact that many of these compounds have potent action against tumors. Thymoquinone (TQ) is the bioactive compound of the volatile oil extracted from the black seed, Nigella sativa. TQ has shown anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic actions with a selective cytotoxicity for human cancer cells compared to several normal cells. Here, we show that TQ is able to dose-dependently inhibit colony formation in three distinct glioblastoma cell lines (T98, U87 and Gli36), with the highly tumorigenic Gli36 being the most sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of TQ. We also show that TQ induces persistent -H2AX activation, a marker of DNA double strand breaks, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TQ also causes G2/M cell cycle arrest in GBM cells to a degree that correlates with the cells' relative clonogenic sensitivity. Moreover, co-treatment with TQ and N-acetyl cysteine, a simple thiol nucleophile and antioxidant, prevented cell death, DNA double strand breaks, and cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that TQ is a potent inhibitor of GBM cell proliferation and growth, and that this effect may be mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species.",Excluded

3116,"A rhodopsin in the brain functions in circadian photoentrainment in Drosophila Animals partition their daily activity rhythms through their internal circadian clocks, which are synchronized by oscillating day-night cycles of light. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster senses day-night cycles in part through rhodopsin-dependent light reception in the compound eye and photoreceptor cells in the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelet. A more noteworthy light entrainment pathway is mediated by central pacemaker neurons in the brain. The Drosophila circadian clock is extremely sensitive to light. However, the only known light sensor in pacemaker neurons, the flavoprotein cryptochrome (Cry), responds only to high levels of light in vitro. These observations indicate that there is an additional light-sensing pathway in fly pacemaker neurons. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized rhodopsin, Rh7, which contributes to circadian light entrainment by circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain. The pacemaker neurons respond to violet light, and this response depends on Rh7. Loss of either cry or rh7 caused minor defects in photoentrainment, whereas loss of both caused profound impairment. The circadian photoresponse to constant light was impaired in rh7 mutant flies, especially under dim light. The demonstration that Rh7 functions in circadian pacemaker neurons represents, to our knowledge, the first role for an opsin in the central brain.",Excluded

3556,"Trends in radiotherapeutic management and outcomes in esophageal brain metastases Objective: To examine national practice patterns and survival outcomes in patients with brain metastases from an esophageal primary treated with intracranial radiation. Background(s): Brain metastasis from an esophageal primary are a rare occurrence, therefore clinical data regarding management and outcomes are limited. Intracranial radiotherapy in the form of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common treatment approaches in management of brain metastases, however the utilization patterns and efficacy of each technique in esophageal based brain metastasis are unknown. Design/Methods: We analyzed 289 stage IV esophageal cancer patients with documented brain metastasis treated with intracranial radiotherapy as reported by the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) between the years 2004-2014. The treatment arms included those receiving WBRT versus SRS. Univariable and multivariable analyses identified characteristics predictive of overall survival. Multivariable logistic regression identified co-variates associated with each treatment arm. Result(s): There were 230 patients in the WBRT group and 59 patients in the SRS group. With multivariable analysis, SRS receipt was an independent predictor of improved overall survival (HR=0.63, p=0.005) along with receipt of chemotherapy, lower comorbidity score, African American race, and absence of liver/bone metastases (p<0.01). Overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years for the WBRT was 17% and 4% (median OS: 4.5 months) compared to 32% and 12% (median OS: 6.9 months) for the SRS arm (p=0.004). Notably, patient age, tumor grade, histology, presence of lung metastasis, and sex were not associated with differences in OS. More recent treatment year was associated with receipt of SRS (p=0.03). Conclusion(s): In the largest known analysis of intracranial radiotherapy in esophageal brain metastases to date, receipt of SRS was associated with increased OS compared to WBRT. Given the limitations of a retrospective analysis, these findings require further investigation.",Excluded
3075,"Glioma invasiveness responds variably to irradiation in a co-culture model PURPOSE: We developed a co-culture system to quantitate the growth and invasion of human malignant gliomas into a background of confluent normal human astrocytes, then used this assay to assess independently the effects of irradiating both cell types on glioma invasion.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled immortalized human astrocytes, human malignant glioma cells, or transformed human astrocytes were focally plated onto a confluent layer of normal human astrocytes, and the invasiveness of EGFP-labeled cells was scored after 96 h. To address the consequences of irradiation on glioma invasion, the invasiveness of irradiated glioma cell lines and irradiated astrocytic backgrounds was assessed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to quantitate the total number of EGFP-labeled cells.RESULTS: Growth in the co-culture assay consistently reflected transformation states of the plated cells. Immortalized, but untransformed human astrocytes failed even to establish growth on confluent normal human astrocytes. In contrast, all malignant human glioma cell lines and transformed human astrocytes demonstrated various degrees of infiltration into the astrocytic bed. Irradiation failed to alter the invasiveness of U87, A172, and U373. A 1-Gy dose slightly reduced the invasiveness of U251 MG by 75% (p < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Neuman-Keuls), without reducing total cell numbers. Independently irradiating the human astrocytic bed did not alter the invasiveness of nonirradiated U251, whereas the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001 reduced U251 invasiveness in the co-culture assay.CONCLUSIONS: Growth in the co-culture assay reflects the transformation status and provides a useful in vitro model for assessing invasiveness. Human glioma invasiveness in the co-culture model responds variably to single low-dose fractions. MMP activity promotes invasiveness in the co-culture model. Reduced invasiveness in irradiated U251 appears to be mediated by MMP-independent mechanisms.",Included

3178,"Heterosynaptic co-activation of glutamatergic and dopaminergic afferents is required to induce persistent long-term potentiation The persistence of protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (late-LTP) is thought to require heterosynaptic activation of both glutamate and neuromodulatory receptors in the hippocampus. The present series of experiments contrasts two alternative accounts of heterosynaptic activation. The original version of the synaptic-tag hypothesis of the variable persistence of LTP implied that neuromodulatory and glutamatergic activation could occur independently, albeit within a critical time-window; an alternative view is that there needs to be simultaneous co-activation of both receptors to trigger the up-regulation of relevant protein synthesis (Neuron 34 (2002) 235). Our findings include a replication, over 6 h post-LTP-induction, of earlier findings showing heterosynaptic influences on LTP persistence. Specifically, 'strong' tetanisation with multiple trains of stimulation of one input pathway in a conventional hippocampal slice preparation induces a D1/D5 receptor-dependent form of late-LTP that enables 'weak' tetanic stimulation to induce late-LTP on an independent pathway. However, we also observed that when the first pathway was tetanised in the presence of AP5, not only was no LTP observed on that pathway, but there was also no rescue of late-LTP on the second pathway. Thus, it appears that DA receptors must be co-activated with NMDA receptors in a common pool of neurons to enable LTP persistence, although late-LTP can still be induced by selective activation of glutamatergic synapses if this occurs at time periods shortly before or shortly after this essential coactivation.",Excluded
2533,"Substantia nigra stimulation influences monkey superior colliculus neuronal activity bilaterally The inhibitory drive arising from the basal ganglia is thought to prevent the occurrence of orienting movements of the eyes, head, and body in monkeys and other mammals. The direct projection from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to the superior colliculus (SC) mediates the inhibition. Since the original experiments in the SNr of monkeys the buildup or prelude neuron has been a focus of SC research. However, whether the SNr influences buildup neurons in SC is unknown. Furthermore, a contralateral SNr-SC pathway is evident in many species but remains unexplored in the alert monkey. Here we introduced electrical stimulation of one or both SNr nuclei while recording from SC buildup neurons. Stimulation of the SNr reduced the discharge rate of SC buildup neurons bilaterally. This result is consistent with activation of an inhibitory drive from SNr to SC. The time course of the influence of ipsilateral SNr on the activity of most SC neurons was longer (approximately 73 ms) than the influence of the contralateral SNr (approximately 34 ms). We also found that the variability of saccade onset time and saccade direction was altered with electrical stimulation of the SNr. Taken together our results show that electrical stimulation activates the inhibitory output of the SNr that in turn, reduces the activity of SC buildup neurons in both hemispheres. However, rather than acting as a gate for saccade initiation, the results suggest that the influence of SNr inhibition on visually guided saccades is more subtle, shaping the balance of excitation and inhibition across the SC.",Excluded
2627,"Use of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC (TEKTROTYD) for radioguided surgery of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: A feasibility study Purpose: Surgical resection of primary tumor and involved lymph nodes in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroen-docrine tumors (GEP-NETs) has a significant prognostic impact. Aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility of radioguided surgical nodal staging using <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC(TEKTROTYD) in GEP-NETs. Subjects and methods: Patients with histologically proven GEP-NET eligible to radical or palliative surgery showing avid tumor uptake on <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy and SPECT/CT were prospectively enrolled. Approximately 4h before surgery, 185 MBq of <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC were i.v. administered. Intraoperative localization of primary tumor and radioactive lymph nodes was performed using a hand-held gamma-probe set on <sup>99M</sup>Tc energy peak. Radioactive lymph nodes were localized and excised before proceeding to regional lymphadenectomy. Extra-regional lymphatic basins were also investigated. Resected specimens were re-evaluated ex vivo with the gamma-probe after macroscopic lymph node isolation. Result(s): Since February 2017, fve GEP-NET patients were enrolled (3 pts had G1-G2 ileal NET, 1 pt G2 rectal NET and 1 pt gastric NEC). All primary lesions seen on pre-operative scin-tigraphy were successfully localized with gamma-probe and completely excised. Mean in-vivo tumor count-rate was 399 counts-per-second/cps (range 80-496). Histological examination confrmed pre-operative diagnosis in all cases. A total of 107 lymph nodes was resected (mean number per patient 21, range 14-40), including 35 radioactive lymph nodes (mean number 7, range 3-12). Mean in-vivo nodal count-rate was 185 cps (range 14-722). 20/35 radioactive lymph nodes were meta-static at histologic examination (mean number 4, range 1-11). No metastatic involvement of ""cold"" lymph nodes was reported. Notably, ex-vivo count-rate of metastatic lymph nodes showed no significant variation from in-vivo gamma-probe evaluation, whereas non-involved nodes showed generally a sharp decrease in ex-vivo count-rate. In one patient, radioguided nodal evaluation determined the localization of a metastatic node in a extra-regional district. Median follow-up after surgery was 11 months (range 5-13). Clinical and instrumental follow-up evaluation showed stable disease in every patient, with no evidence of nodal disease recurrence. Conclusion(s): This pilot study con-frmed feasibility of radioguided nodal staging in GEP-NET patients. The use of <sup>99M</sup>Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC allowed manageable surgical scheduling, limiting radiation exposure of patients and medical staf. Moreover, this procedure can be performed using a standard gamma-probe routinely used for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Preliminary results on false-negative rate suggest that this could represent a reliable approach for surgical nodal staging with a clinical impact on prognosis.",Excluded

2834,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded

3323,"Exploring the cost-effectiveness of thoracic radiation therapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer Purpose/Objective(s): The recently reported Chest Radiotherapy Extensive Stage Trial (CREST) showed that administering thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) after a response to first-line chemotherapy improves 2-year overall (OS) and progression-free survival, without an increase in adverse events, in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adding TRT to chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ESSCLC patients. Materials/Methods: Using a partitioned survival model, a cost-utility analysis was performed to compare strategies of TRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions via 3-D conformal RT) plus PCI versus PCI alone. The time horizon was limited to 24 months, the median follow-up of CREST. OS was partitioned into three mutually exclusive health states: alive with no progression (ANP), alive with progression (AWP), and dead. The proportion of patients in each health state over time was based on the empirical survival functions reported in CREST. Institutional treatment costs from a payer perspective were used while utilities were derived from the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using a 3% discount rate. Sensitivity analyses addressed plausible ranges of uncertainty in key variables including costs, utilities, and the TRT survival benefit. Result(s): In the base-case analysis, adding TRT resulted in a $4,066 cost increase and a gain of 0.06 QALYs (0.09 LYs), yielding an ICER of $66,901/QALY ($46,568/LY). Extending the time horizon to 30 months, assuming: (1), a persistent survival benefit and (2), a declining benefit to a hazard ratio of 1, resulted in ICERs of $93,204 and $111,916/QALY respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed the ICER to be most sensitive to variations in ANP and AWP health state costs. The ICER was moderately sensitive to variations in TRT costs and the utility for the ANP state, but less sensitive to changes in the utility for the AWP state. Conclusion(s): Adding TRT to chemotherapy in ES-SCLC patients was found to be cost effective using commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds, with an ICER lower than those of many systemic treatments for metastatic disease. Since the incremental survival benefit of TRT beyond 24 months is small, its cost-effectiveness is expected to decrease if costs remain constant.",Excluded
3000,"Human mesenchymal stem cells home specifically to radiation-injured tissues in a non-obese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model The therapeutic potential of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) has recently been brought into the spotlights of many fields of research. One possible application of the approach is the repair of tissue injuries related to side effects of radiotherapy. The first challenge in cell therapy is to assess the quality of the cell and the ability to retain their differentiation potential during the expansion process. Efficient delivery to the sites of intended action is also necessary. We addressed both challenges using hMSC cultured and then infused to non-obese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to total body irradiation. Furthermore, we tested the impact of additional abdominal irradiation superimposed to total body irradiation (TBI), as a model of local therapeutic irradiation. Our results showed that the hMSC used for transplant have been expanded without significant loss in their differentiation capacities. After transplantation into adult unconditioned mice, hMSC not only migrate in bone marrow but also into other tissues. Total body irradiation increased hMSC implantation in bone marrow and muscle and further led to engraftment in brain, heart and liver. Local irradiation in addition to TBI, increased homing of injected cells to the injured tissues and to other tissues outside the local irradiation field. Morphological recovery of irradiated tissues after MSC transplantation and/or differentiation of MSC into specific organ cell types needs to be investigated. This study suggests that using the potential of hMSC to home to various organs in response to tissue injuries might be a strategy to repair the radiation-induced damages.",Excluded
3248,"Exposure to 2.45 GHz Radiation Triggers Changes in HSP-70, Glucocorticoid Receptors and GFAP Biomarkers in Rat Brain Brain tissue may be especially sensitive to electromagnetic phenomena provoking signs of neural stress in cerebral activity. Fifty-four adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent ELISA and immunohistochemistry testing of four relevant anatomical areas of the cerebrum to measure biomarkers indicating induction of heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70), glucocorticoid receptors (GCR) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) after single or repeated exposure to 2.45 GHz radiation in the experimental set-up. Neither radiation regime caused tissue heating, so thermal effects can be ruled out. A progressive decrease in GCR and HSP-70 was observed after acute or repeated irradiation in the somatosensory cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus. In the limbic cortex; however, values for both biomarkers were significantly higher after repeated exposure to irradiation when compared to control animals. GFAP values in brain tissue after irradiation were not significantly different or were even lower than those of nonirradiated animals in all brain regions studied. Our results suggest that repeated exposure to 2.45 GHz elicited GCR/HSP-70 dysregulation in the brain, triggering a state of stress that could decrease tissue anti-inflammatory action without favoring glial proliferation and make the nervous system more vulnerable.",Excluded
2641,"Motexafin gadolinium: a novel redox active drug for cancer therapy Motexafin gadolinium (MGd, Xcytrin) is an aromatic macrocycle that has a strong affinity for electrons, i.e., it is easily reduced. In the presence of oxygen, MGd accepts electrons from various cellular reducing metabolites and forms superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) by redox cycling. The reaction with NADPH is dramatically accelerated by various oxido-reductases including thioredoxin reductase. In vitro studies with various cancer cell lines have shown an increase in ROS and intracellular free zinc in cells treated with MGd. MGd increases cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation and various chemotherapy agents and may be directly cytotoxic to tumor cells under certain conditions. MGd selectively localizes in tumors, perhaps due to their metabolic perturbations. MGd treatment in murine models enhances tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy agents. In controlled, randomized clinical trials, combining MGd treatment with ionizing radiation improves time to neurologic progression in lung cancer patients with brain metastases. The molecular target for MGd appears to be thioredoxin reductase which, when inhibited, results in cellular redox stress, cytotoxicity and an increase in tumor responsiveness to a variety of treatments.

[German] Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) are common conditions involving many medical specialities, each with its own approach to diagnosis and treatment. Management of these conditions requires knowledge of pelvic organ systems, neuro-functional pelvic anatomy, and of the musculoskeletal, neurologic and psychiatric aspects. No current speciality seems to be devoted to all these aspects of the field. Neuropelveology is an emerging speciality focusing on the pathologies of the pelvic nervous system. It is based on a neurological/ neurosurgical approach combining the knowledge required for a proper neurologic diagnosis with advanced laparoscopic surgery in selected cases of CPP/CPPS. The laparoscopic approach to the pelvic nerves enables nerve-sparing techniques, neurosurgical procedures but also selective placement of stimulating electrodes to all nerves and plexuses for treatment of neuropathic pain and dysfunctions. For patients with spinal cord injuries, this technique enables new strategies for control/recovery-assisted locomotion in selected paraplegics. The development of new technologies does not only assist spinal cord injured people with the common problems associated with inertia when confined to a wheelchair, but finds further revolutionary applications in the world of space missions. In addressing the physical disadvantages the astronaut faces when weightless in space by the introduction of an >>in-body<< micro stimulator, which allows muscle mass and bone density to be maintained even whilst the astronaut is sleeping, the stimulating technique provides an extremely effective and time-saving strength training program. The advantages of the LION Procedure (Laparoscopic Implantation of Neuroprothesis) are profound when it comes to counteracting the effects of prolonged microgravity on the human body. It should be also appreciated that the capability of the implantation of micro stimulators within the body to nerves for muscle stimulation, opens the door to a whole new area of humanity, the >>e-control-body<<, in which implanted electronics may help the human body to better performance and a longer life as a result (ageing control).

Histopathologic interpretation of brain specimens is often challenging due to the presence of significant radiation effects admixed with irradiated residual tumor of indeterminate viability. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of histologic findings on clinical outcomes following resection of these lesions. Between 2004 and 2010, 690 patients with brain metastases were enrolled in a prospective gamma knife data repository, and lesions requiring excision were identified. Tissue specimens were divided into four groups based on the ratio of treatment related inflammatory changes (TRIC) to tumor cells, and subsequently patient outcomes were assessed. Of 2,583 metastases treated, 36 were excised due to symptomatic enlargement. Only TRIC, without residual evidence of tumor, was seen in 36 % (13/36) of specimens. Resection of these lesions resulted in 100 % local control in follow-up. Of the remaining 23 lesions that contained any viable-appearing tumor within the resected specimen, 8 recurred after resection. Lesions that enlarged in the first 6 months were more likely to contain higher amounts of residual tumor cells. Patients with even <2 % tumors cells on excision had significantly worse local control (75 vs. 100 %, p = 0.024) and survival (HR 0.27, p = 0.029) compared with those patients with exclusively TRIC.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the release of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38) and its effects on sensory neuropeptide release in vitro and acute neurogenic ear swelling in vivo. Capsaicin (10(-6) M) or electrical field stimulation (EFS; 40 V, 0.1 ms, 10 Hz, 120 s; 1200 impulses)-induced release of PACAP-38, SP, CGRP and somatostatin from isolated rat tracheae was measured with radioimmunoassay. Mustard oil-induced neurogenic inflammation in the mouse ear was determined with a micrometer and in the rat hind paw skin by the Evans Blue leakage technique. Capsaicin and EFS evoked 27% and more than twofold elevation of PACAP-38 release respectively, compared with the prestimulated basal values from isolated trachea preparation. Exogenously administered PACAP-38 (20-2000 nM) diminished both capsaicin- and EFS-evoked sensory neuropeptide release in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal inhibitory effects of PACAP on capsaicin-induced substance P, CGRP and somatostatin release amounted to 75.4%, 73.3% and 90.0%, while EFS-evoked release of these peptides was 80.03%, 87.7% and 67.7%. In case of capsaicin stimulation the EC50 values for substance P, CGRP and somatostatin were 82.9 nM, 60.1 nM and 66.9 nM, respectively. When EFS was performed, these corresponding EC50 data were 92.1 nM, 67.8 nM and 20.9 nM.

These results suggest that PACAP-38 is released from the stimulated peripheral terminals of capsaicin-sensitive afferents and it is able to inhibit the outflow of sensory neuropeptides. Based on this mechanism of action PACAP is also able to effectively diminish/abolish neurogenic inflammatory response in vivo after systemic administration.",Excluded

2766,"Serotonergic modulation of psychological stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampal CA1 field In order to elucidate possible involvement of the serotonergic neuronal system in the stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity, the effects of contextual fear conditioning (CFC) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 field were examined in 5-HT-depleted rats by pretreatment with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, 200 microg/rat, i.c.v.). LTP induction was suppressed by footshock (FS) stimulation in 5-HT-lesioned rats and vehicle-treated controls. When rats were exposed to CFC, which was received 24 h after FS stimulation, LTP was also blocked in both-treated groups. CFC-induced impairment of LTP, however, significantly attenuated in 5-HT-lesioned rats when compared with that in controls. Fear-related freezing behavior after FS stimulation occurred similarly in both treated groups, whereas the behavior observed during exposure to CFC significantly reduced in 5-HT-lesioned rats.

Light activation in rod photoreceptors was established using a paired-flash electroretinogram (ERG) protocol, and the leading edge of the a-wave was modeled with the mechanisms mediating phototransduction. Deactivation of the photoreceptor response was evaluated at three luminous exposures (1.4-2.2 log cd.m/s-2) using a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) paradigm. Dark adaptation was evaluated at 90-second intervals for 30 minutes after approximately 20% pigment bleach. At each time point, a paired-flash signal (1.4 log cd.s/m-2) was used to extract rod responses.RESULTS: Diabetic animals showed decreased amplitudes of the photoreceptor response 12 weeks after diabetes induction. No difference was found in the rate of deactivation of the photoresponse in diabetic rats. Normalized amplitudes showed that diabetic animals had significantly faster dark adaptation (P<0.01) than did controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although photoreceptor activation was abnormal, deactivation was unaltered after 12 weeks of diabetes. The faster relative recovery found in diabetes after bleach, in the presence of normal pigment dynamics, may reflect a decrease in outer segment lengths.",Excluded
2453,"Rapamycin attenuates visible light-induced injury in retinal photoreceptor cells via inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress An extended exposure of the retina to visible light may lead to photochemical damage in retinal photoreceptor cells. The exact mechanism of retinal light damage remains unknown, and an effective therapy is still unavailable. Here, we demonstrated that rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), markedly protected 661W photoreceptor cells from visible light exposure-induced damage at the nanomolar level. We also observed by transmission electron microscopy that light exposure led to severe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in 661W cells as well as abnormal endomembranes and ER membranes. In addition, obvious upregulated ER stress markers were monitored by western blot at the protein level and by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the mRNA level. Interestingly, rapamycin pretreatment significantly suppressed light-induced ER stress and all three major branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR), including the RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathways both at the protein and mRNA levels. Additionally, the inhibition of ER stress by rapamycin was further confirmed with a dithiothreitol (DTT; a classical ER stress inducer)-damaged 661W cell model. Meanwhile, our results also revealed that rapamycin was able to remarkably inhibit the activation of mTOR and its downstream factors eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), p-4EBP1, p70, p-p70, and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p-S6K) in the light-injured 661W cells. Thus, these data indicate that visible light induces ER stress in 661W cells; whereas the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, effectively protects 661W cells from light injury through suppressing the ER stress pathway.",Excluded

Comparison of novel machine vision image guidance system with a 3D fluoroscopy-based platform for pedicle screw placement: a randomized prospective study of radiation, accuracy, and cost BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The use of image guidance and robotics platforms has increased patient safety, accuracy and operative efficiency and reduced revision rates during pedicle screw placement procedures. However, traditional intraoperative 3D or computational tomography (CT) imaging produces potentially harmful ionizing radiation and increases operative time to register the patient. An image guidance platform using machine vision through high resolution stereoscopic cameras and structured visible light does not use ionizing radiation while it builds a 3D topographical map of the patient's anatomy for navigation use. PURPOSE: We aimed to compare a novel machine vision image guidance system (MvIGS) system to a widely used 3D fluoroscopy (3D) platform by comparing radiation exposure, and pedicle screw accuracy. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A randomized prospective comparative cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing posterior lumbar instrumented fusion. PATIENT SAMPLE: Adults diagnosed with a spinal condition requiring surgical treatment and planning to have posterior open lumbar fusion with pedicle screws implanted into 1-4 vertebral levels. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included: mean intraoperative fluoroscopy time and dose, mean preoperative CT dose length product (DLP) and mean day 2 postoperative CT DLP, pedicle screw accuracy and rate of revision surgery. METHOD(S): Patients were randomized 1:1 to MvIGS or 3D and underwent posterior lumbar instrumented fusion. Radiation doses were recorded from pre- and postoperative CT and intraoperative fluoroscopy. Independent blinded radiologists reviewed pedicle screw accuracy. RESULT(S): A total of 303 (154 MvIGS, 149 3D) pedicle screws were placed in 63 patients (33 MvIGS, 30 3D) over the 12-month study period. Mean age and indication for surgery were similar between both groups. Mean intraoperative fluoroscopy time and doses were significantly reduced in MvIGS compared to 3D (5.2+/-4.1s vs 79.6+/-23.3s, p<0.001 and 133.0+/-215.8cGycm2 vs 3704.1+/-1640.5cGycm2, p<0.001, respectively). This represents a relative reduction of 93.5% in the total intraoperative time and 96.4% reduction in the total dose. Mean preoperative CT DLP and mean day 2 postoperative CT DLP were significantly reduced in MvIGS compared to 3D (590.8+/-389.6mGy*cm vs 1008.9+/-616.3mGy*cm, p<0.001 and 518.1+/-205.6mGy*cmvs 958.7+/-449.6mGy*cm, p<0.001, respectively). This represents a relative reduction of 41.4% and 46.0% relative reduction in the preoperative CT dose and postoperative total DLP, respectively. The MvIGS group required an average of 1.2 registrations each case with an average of 2447 (SD=961.3) data points registered with mean registration time of 106s (SD=52.1s). A rapid re-registration mechanism was utilized in 22% (n=7/33) of cases. Pedicle screw accuracy was high in both groups MvIGS (98.7%) vs 3D (97.3%) with no pedicle breach >2mm in either group (p>0.001). No neurovascular injuries occurred, and no patients needed return to theatre for screw repositioning. CONCLUSION(S): Both MvIGS and 3D image guidance platforms demonstrated high accuracy for pedicle screw placement. MvIGS demonstrated significant reduction of 93.5% and 96.4% in intraoperative radiation time and dose. MvIGS may provide similar accuracy to contemporary image guidance platforms without requiring 3D fluoroscopy or radiolucent operating tables. Reducing registration times and the need for specialized equipment may significantly reduce operating room costs.

3650,"Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation after cranial irradiation with (56)Fe particles Exposure to heavy-ion radiation is considered a potential health risk in long-term space travel. In the central nervous system (CNS), loss of critical cellular components may lead to performance decrements that could ultimately compromise mission goals and long-term quality of life. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments occur after exposure to ionizing radiation, and while the pathogenesis of this effect is not yet clear, it may involve the production of newly born neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We irradiated mice with 0.5-4 Gy of (56)Fe ions and 2 months later quantified neurogenesis and numbers of activated microglia as a measure of neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that there were few changes after 0.5 Gy, but that there was a dose-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and a dose-related increase in numbers of newly born activated microglia from 0.5-4.0 Gy. While those findings were similar to what was reported after X irradiation, there were also some differences, particularly in the response of newly born glia. Overall, this study showed that hippocampal neurogenesis was sensitive to relatively low doses of (56)Fe particles, and that those effects were associated with neuroinflammation. Whether these changes will result in functional impairments or if/how they can be managed are topics for further investigation.",Included
3356,"Gamma radiation (5-10 Gy) impairs neuronal function in the guinea pig hippocampus Guinea pigs were exposed to 5 and 10 Gy gamma radiation. Hippocampal brain slices were isolated 30 min, 1 day, 3 days and 5 days after irradiation or sham irradiation and the electrophysiological characteristics of the neural tissue were evaluated. Both radiation doses elicited significant changes that were dependent on dose, dose rate and time. Synaptic efficacy decreased soon after exposure to 5 Gy at dose rates of both 1 and 20 Gy/min. Recovery occurred by 5 days. Ten grays at 20 Gy/min potentiated the postsynaptic potential 1 day after irradiation. By 3 days, synaptic efficacy was decreased and did not recover. The ability of the synaptic potentials to generate spikes was potentiated within 30 min after exposure to 5 Gy at 1 Gy/min and persisted through 3 days, with recovery at 5 days. At the 20 Gy/min dose rate, a similar potentiation did not result with 10 Gy and occurred only at 3 days after irradiation with 5 Gy. Rather, within 30 min and after 5 days, spike generation was significantly depressed by these exposures. Both synaptic efficacy and spike generation contribute to the net input-output relationship of the neuronal population. This relationship was profoundly decreased within 30 min with recovery at 1 day and subsequent decline with the higher dose rate in a dose-dependent manner. These persistent changes in neuronal function are likely to be a consequence of the actions of ionizing radiation on the physiological processes that influence the neuronal environment.",Included

3313,"A review of the necessary planning target volume margins for patients receiving radiation to the brain, with the current immobilization devices in use at the hopital regional de sudbury regional hospital regional cancer program The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the current margins of the planning target volumes in brain patients being treated at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program. The gross tumour volume (GTV) is defined in the International Commission for Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU) report 83 (2010) as the gross demonstrable extent and location of the tumour. The clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as the volume of a tissue that contains the GTV and any microscopic tumour spread. The planning target volume (PTV) is defined by the ICRU 83 report (2010) as the margin accounting for both the internal and external uncertainties. With the use of image-guided radiation therapy such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), imaging and positioning has become much more accurate. A CBCT uses a 3D reconstructed volume of the patient's current position before treatment to verify and correct the setup. This is done by comparing it to the planning patient position as seen with the planning CT image and making any adjustments while the patient is on the bed (Pouliot, Bani-Hashemi, Chen, Svatos, Ghelmansarai, Mitschke, 2005). Daily imaging before treatment has allowed for positioning of the patient accurately to match the image taken for planning purposes. This allows the patient to be set up within millimetres of the position they were in for planning. Currently at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program, daily imaging for patients receiving radiation to the brain is not standard practice, however, some patients are imaged daily by request from the physician. By using the shift data from patients who have received daily imaging, the setup uncertainty for every fraction can be determined and used to determine an appropriate PTV margin for the majority of patients, who are not imaged daily. If the PTV can be reduced for brain patients being treated, less of the normal brain tissue would be irradiated and could have the potential to reduce acute and late neurotoxicity of treatment (McDonald et al., 2011). A retrospective review of patients who have previously received radiation to the brain with daily CBCT imaging will be done to examine the shifts done before treatment to match the CBCT to the planning CT image. The patient population will include patients who received brain radiation and a daily CBCT before treatment since July 2010. The images taken daily before treatment will be retrospectively studied using the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program's electronic charting system (Mosaic). The shift data examined of patients who received daily imaging can be applied to a calculation proposed by van Herk (2004) to determine the PTV margin accounting for setup error. The shift data describes the measurements by which the patient was shifted after daily imaging to match the original planning image. This equation uses the shift data to determine the PTV margin for those patients who do not receive daily imaging. All patient data will be anonymous and will be kept on a locked password protected computer.",Excluded

Consolidation cytarabine was given after the radiotherapy. The primary end point was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving rdWBRT. Exploratory end points included prospective neuropsychological evaluation, analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) white matter changes using the Fazekas scale, and evaluation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a prognostic factor.RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled, with median age of 60 years (range, 30 to 79 years) and median Karnofsky performance score of 70 (range, 50 to 100). Thirty-one patients (60%) achieved a CR after R-MPV and received rdWBRT. The 2-year PFS for this group was 77%; median PFS was 7.7 years. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached (median follow-up for survivors, 5.9 years); 3-year OS was 87%. The overall (N = 52) median PFS was 3.3 years, and median OS was 6.6 years. Cognitive assessment showed improvement in executive function (P < .01) and verbal memory (P < .05) after chemotherapy, and follow-up scores remained relatively stable across the various domains (n = 12). All examined MRIs (n = 28) displayed a Fazekas score of <= 3, and no patient developed scores of 4 to 5; differences in ADC values did not predict response (P = .15), PFS (P = .27), or OS (P = .33).CONCLUSION: R-MPV combined with consolidation rdWBRT and cytarabine is associated with high response rates, long-term disease control, and minimal neurotoxicity.",Excluded
2763,"Prognostic factors in glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving high-dose particle radiotherapy or conventional radiotherapy The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of prognostic factors related to patient selection on survival outcomes. Survival outcomes were retrospectively analysed in a consecutive series of 67 newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients who had received either conventional fractionated photon radiotherapy (CRT) or high-dose particle radiotherapy (HDT). In the CRT protocol, a total dose of 60.0-61.2 Gy was administered. In the HDT protocol, an average dose of approximately 30 GyE in a single session and additional fractionated photon irradiation of total dose 30 Gy were administered to patients receiving boron neutron capture therapy; and a total dose of 96.6 GyE was administered to patients receiving proton therapy. Most of the patients had received chemotherapy with nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) alone or with ACNU, procarbazine and vincristine. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival times for all patients were 17.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.6-20.9 months] and 7.8 months (95% CI, 5.7-9.9 months), respectively. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 67.2% and 33.7%, respectively. For patients treated with HDT, the median OS was 24.4 months (95% CI, 18.2-30.5 months), compared with 14.2 months (95% CI, 10.0-18.3 months) for those treated with CRT. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed radiation modality (HDT vs CRT) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recursive partitioning analysis class to be the significant prognostic factors. Age, sex, pre-operative performance status, treatment with or without advanced neuroimaging, extent of surgery and regimen of chemotherapy were not statistically significant factors in predicting prognosis. The median OS was 18.5 months (95% CI, 9.9-27.1 months) in patients of 65 years and older, compared with 16.8 months (95% CI, 13.6-20.1 months) in those 64 years and younger (p=0.871).

Methods and Materials: From August 1998 to May 2009, 207 patients were treated with radiation therapy (RT) at British Columbia Cancer Agency. 136 (66%) received SRS, and 71 (34%) received SRT. Dose prescriptions were 50 Gy/25 fractions for SRT and 12 Gy/1 fraction for SRS. Our multidisciplinary provincial neuro-stereotactic conference recommended SRT for tumors >3 cm and for patients with serviceable hearing (Gardner-Robertson classes I and II). Result(s): Median follow-up was 7.7 years to the last MRI and 6.4 years to the last clinical assessment. Local control for SRS versus SRT was 94% versus 87% at 5 years and 90% versus 85% at 10 years (P=.2). Five- and 10-year actuarial rates of RT-induced trigeminal nerve dysfunction were 25% and 25% after SRS, compared with 7% and 12% after SRT (P=.01). Five- and 10-year actuarial rates of RT-induced facial nerve dysfunction were 15% and 15% after SRS, versus 13% and 15% after SRT (P=.93). In the 49 patients with serviceable hearing at baseline who were treated with SRT, hearing preservation was 55% at 3 years, 37% at 5 years, and 29% at 7 years. In multivariable analysis, better pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average was significantly associated with hearing preservation (hazard ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.07; P=.04). Conclusion(s): Both SRS and SRT provided excellent long-term local control of vestibular schwannoma. Stereotactic radiosurgery was associated with higher rates of trigeminal nerve dysfunction. Even with a fractionated course, hearing preservation declined steadily with long-term audiometric follow-up. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Recent studies synthesize new quinolone derivatives to satisfy other purposes such as treatment of inflammatory and malignant diseases. The main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a new quinolone derivative; 2-(1-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid (EHQA) and its possible mechanism against gamma radiation (IRR) and cisplatin (Cis) induced nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity in mice. The structure of the newly synthesized quinolone derivative was elucidated by microanalytical and spectral data, which were found consistent with the assigned structures. Exposure to Cis and IRR significantly induced renal damage manifested by a significant increase in levels of urea and creatinine. Moreover, the exposure to both Cis and IRR significantly decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic protein; Bcl-2 in both renal and brain tissue homogenate accompanied by activation of an inflammatory marker; IL-17. Immunophenoting results showed an activation of T- lymphocytes marker; CD3 and B-lymphocytes marker; CD19. Interperitonial administration of EHQA significantly ameliorated the above-mentioned parameters. Overall, the present results indicated that EHQA is a promising anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. From the obtained results it can be concluded that EHQA could be a candidate as immunomodulatory agents. Further studies are required to establish its molecular mechanism.",Excluded

Energy was measured with a photodiode through a 7-mm trephined hole in the posterior pole. Average percentage power, average power, and average energy transmission were calculated. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) guidelines were used to calculate allowable energy exposures for each laser.RESULTS: All 3 lasers transmitted 3% to 5% of the power to the posterior pole. The average energy transmission was 240 to 260 mJ for all lasers. The contact lasers had an average power transmission of 120 mW. The noncontact Nd:YAG laser, with shorter pulse duration, had an average power transmission of 13,000 mW, significantly greater than that of the other lasers. The ACGIH guidelines for allowable energy exposures were 93 mJ for the noncontact Nd:YAG laser, 1300 mJ for the contact Nd:YAG laser, and 440 mJ for the contact diode laser.CONCLUSIONS: Three percent to 5% of laser power delivered during cyclophotocoagulation reaches the posterior pole.

We evaluated the impact of adding cediranib to standard chemoradiation (CRT) on peritumoral edema in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma(GBM) during the initial 6 weeks of CRT. Method(s): Two cohorts of patients were enrolled in two clinical trials. The control group (N=13) received radiation for 6 weeks plus temozolomide. The cediranib (CED) group received standard CRT plus daily cediranib (N=34). MRIs were performed at baseline and weekly during CRT. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were drawn outlining the enhancing tumor on T1-weighted post contrast images and the abnormal FLAIR hyperintensity. ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) maps were calculated from diffusion-weighted images and histograms of the distribution of ADC values created for each visit using the baseline FLAIR VOI to characterize the peritumoraledema. Patients were on stable or decreasing doses of steroids. Result(s): In the CED group, T1 and FLAIR VOI decreased during CRT vs controls where T1 VOI did not change and FLAIR VOI increased. By the end of CRT, the mode of the ADC histogram in the CED group shifted to the left while the mode of the controls shifted to the right. The skewness, a measure of asymmetry of the distribution, increased in the CED group and decreased in controls. Conclusion(s): In patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated with CRT and cediranib, tumor volume decreased on T1 and FLAIR images whereas the FLAIR volume significantly increased in the control group suggesting increased edema. The shift of mode to the right and decreasing skewness in controls (indicating an increase in the proportion of very high ADC values) suggests that adding cediranibprevented the development of edema and contributed to the resolution of existing edema. Preventing the edema by adding anti-VEGF treatment may improve the tolerability of CRT for GBM patients. (Table presented) .",Excluded

2932,"Toward improved target conformity for two spot scanning proton therapy delivery systems using dynamic collimation Purpose: To quantify improvement in target conformity in brain and head and neck tumor treatments resulting from the use of a dynamic collimation system (DCS) with two spot scanning proton therapy delivery systems (universal nozzle, UN, and dedicated nozzle, DN) with median spot sizes of 5.2 and 3.2 mm over a range of energies from 100 to 230 MeV. Method(s): Uncollimated and collimated plans were calculated with both UN and DN beam models implemented within our in-house treatment planning system for five brain and ten head and neck datasets in patients previously treated with spot scanning proton therapy. The prescription dose and beam angles from the clinical plans were used for both the UN and DN plans. The average reduction of the mean dose to the 10-mm ring surrounding the target between the uncollimated and collimated plans was calculated for the UN and the DN. Target conformity was analyzed using the mean dose to 1-mm thickness rings surrounding the target at increasing distances ranging from 1 to 10 mm. Result(s): The average reductions of the 10-mm ring mean dose for the UN and DN plans were 13.7% (95% CI: 11.6%-15.7%; p < 0.0001) and 11.5% (95% CI: 9.5%-13.5%; p < 0.0001) across all brain cases and 7.1% (95% CI: 4.4%-9.8%; p < 0.001) and 6.3% (95% CI: 3.7%-9.0%; p < 0.001), respectively, across all head and neck cases. The collimated UN plans were either more conformal (all brain cases and 60% of the head and neck cases) than or equivalent (40% of the head and neck cases) to the uncollimated DN plans. The collimated DN plans offered the highest conformity. Conclusion(s): The DCS added either to the UN or DN improved the target conformity. The DCS may be of particular interest for sites with UN systems looking for a more economical solution than upgrading the nozzle to improve the target conformity of their spot scanning proton therapy system.

Male, Sprague-Dawley rats confined to 10-14 days of HU, or casted control (CC) condition were surgically instrumented with indwelling vascular catheters, a radiotelemetry transmitter or an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) electrode. Anhedonia was measured through sucrose preference and the response to ICSS. Sequential autonomic blockade following administration of propranolol and atropine and time-domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were used to measure sympathovagal balance. Cardiac arrhythmias were produced and scored following sympathetic stimulation (SS) via isoproterenol administration and brief handling/restraint. HU resulted in reductions in both sucrose preference and ICSS. Propranolol administration elicited a significantly greater bradycardia in HU vs. CC rats, while the tachycardic response to methyl-atropine was nearly abolished in HU rats. HU resulted in a significantly lower HRV and a greater arrhythmic burden following SS. Thus, HU elicits behavioral signs consistent with psychological depression, cardiac sympathovagal imbalance and an increased vulnerability to cardiac arrhythmias.",Excluded
3004,"Acute vagus nerve stimulation using different pulse widths produces varying brain effects BACKGROUND: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved treatment for epilepsy and has been investigated in clinical trials of depression. Little is known about the relationship of VNS parameters to brain function. Using the interleaved VNS /functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, we tested whether variations of VNS pulse width (PW) would produce different immediate brain activation in a manner consistent with single neuron PW studies.METHODS: Twelve adult patients with major depression, treated with VNS, underwent three consecutive VNS/fMRI scans, each randomly using one of three PWs (130 micros, 250 micros, or 500 micros). The data were analyzed with SPM2.RESULTS: Global activations induced by PWs 250 and 500 were both significantly greater than that induced by PW 130 but not significantly different from each other. For global deactivation, PWs 130 and 250 were both significantly greater than PW 500 but not significantly different from each other. Regional similarities and differences were also seen with the various PWs.CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm our hypothesis that VNS at PW 500 globally produces no more activation than does PW 250, and PW 130 is insufficient for activation of some regions. These data suggest that PW is an important variable in producing VNS brain effects.",Excluded
2851,"Tissue slice cultures from humans or rodents: a new tool to evaluate biological effects of heavy ions The aim of this interdisciplinary project is to establish slice culture preparations from rodents and humans as a new model system for studying effects of X-rays and heavy ions within normal and tumor tissues. The advantage of such slice cultures relies on the conservation of an organotypic environment, the easy treatment and observation by live-imaging microscopy, and the independence from genetic immortalization strategies used to generate cell lines. Rat brains as well as human tumors were cut into 300-mum-thick sections and cultivated in an incubator in a humidified atmosphere at 37 degrees C. This is realized by a membrane-based culture system with a liquid-air interface. With this system, it is possible to keep rodent slices viable for several months. Human brain tumor slices remained vital for at least 21 days. Slices were irradiated with X-rays at the radiation facility of the University Hospital in Frankfurt/Main at doses up to 40 Gy. Heavy ion irradiations were performed at GSI (Darmstadt) with different ions, energies, and doses. The irradiated slices were analyzed by 3D-confocal microscopy following immunostaining for DNA damage, microglia, and proliferation markers. The phosphorylated histone gammaH2AX proved to be suitable for the detection of ion traversals in this system.",Included

Associations between clinical factors, PI3K mutations status, and local failure (LF) were evaluated with univariate and multivariate competing risks regression.RESULTS: A total of 112 patients received whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) to a median dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions, and 147 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to 338 lesions; 276 lesions were treated with single fraction SRS (median dose 21 Gy) and 76 lesions over 3 to 5 fractions SRS (median dose 30 Gy). PI3K mutations were present in 36 WBRT patients (32%) and 44 SRS patients (30%). For WBRT, patients with PI3K mutations (hazard ratio 2.67, P < .001) were found to be at higher risk for LF on multivariable analysis, and the 1-year cumulative incidence of LF was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI] 32%-65%) for patients with PI3K mutations versus 26% (95% CI 17%-37%) for patients without PI3K mutations. For SRS lesions, while PI3K mutations positivity was not statistically significantly associated with LF, higher rate of LF was observed: 1-year LF cumulative incidence of 11% (95% CI 6%-17%) for patients with PI3K mutations versus 5% (95% CI 3%-9%) for patients without PI3K mutations.CONCLUSION: Patients with PI3K mutations are at higher risk for LF for brain metastases after RT. Novel therapeutic strategies to improve treatment outcomes in these patients should be considered.",Excluded

It is important to study the results that could be achieved when TARE is being used to treat liver metastasis of other origin. This retrospective analysis concentrates on our institutional experience with TARE for the treatment of liver metastasis from neuroendocrine cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Our institutional review board (IRB)-approved Y-90 databank was reviewed to identify patients with neuroendocrine cancer who received Y-90 TARE for liver metastasis from February 2011 to September 2013. Information on patient demographics, performance status, disease-related characteristics (liver panel, complete blood count [CBC], chromogranin A, and gross tumor volume [GTV] measured in cc on the most recent study pre-TARE), treatment-related parameters (Y-90 dose delivered), and treatment outcome (treatment toxicity, overall survival [OS]) were captured for this analysis. Result(s): Between February 2011 and September 2013, a total of 16 patients with metastatic neuroendocrine (liver-predominant disease) received Y-90 TARE in our institution. Eight of these patients received treatment to both liver lobes, for a total of 24 procedures. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status between 0 and 2 prior to treatment. In addition, all patients had a bilirubin level below 2.0 and an albumin level above 3.0 prior to treatment. The median GTV per lobe was 299 cc (range: 27-670 cc). With a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range: 2-26 mo), the 1-year OS was 75%. There was no relationship between OS and GTV volume. Two patients with severe endocrine disorders that required repeated hospitalization (one patient with severe hypoglycemia and a second patient with hypertensive crisis) responded well to TARE, with marked improvement in their medical condition and no need for further admission postprocedure. In terms of treatment toxicity, one patient was diagnosed with a radiation-induced liver disease and died 13 months post-treatment. One patient developed a pancytopenia that was potentially related to treatment. Conclusion(s): The use of Y-90 TARE for patients with liver metastasis from neuroendocrine carcinoma is a treatment option that should be assessed in a prospective multicentric study. In this series, Y-90 TARE was associated with a high 1-year survival rate. However, patients need to be monitored closely postprocedure, since serious treatment-related toxicity could develop.",Excluded
3395,"Dye-induced photolesion in the mammalian retina: glial and neuronal reactions Irradiation in the presence of a dye applied to the extracellular space is known to produce degenerative features in irradiated neurones and fibers. In the present study, we confirmed the potential use of this procedure as a lesion technique by showing the removal of degenerating elements as part of the glial reaction to the lesion. The dye Rose Bengal was applied to the vitreous body of a rat eye and a T-shaped irradiation pattern was projected onto the retina within the absorption band of the dye. Degenerative features were restricted to the irradiated area, which could be readily identified from its shape. Retinae examined after various survival times showed that macrophages invaded the damaged area within 1 day, and that mitotic activity of reactive glial cells subsequently occurred in the vicinity of the wound. Both cell types were identified by their structural features. Macrophages were also revealed by a staining technique using the dye Nile Red, whereas reactive glial cells were immunolabeled with an antibody directed against the glial fibrillary acidic protein. Reactive glial cells helped the macrophages to gradually remove injured cells and damaged processes. Their main task, however, appeared to be in scar formation, since their processes seemed to suture the lips of the wound together and restore the limiting membrane at the inner retina. After 2 months' survival time, the parent ganglion cells of most disrupted axon bundles had retrogradely degenerated, but regenerating ganglion cell axons were also observed. These results provide some new data about healing processes in the retina. They demonstrate that the dye-induced photolesion technique can be used to either remove or axotomize selected neurones in neural networks which have been made optically accessible.",Excluded
2463,"Glutamate microinjection into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus attenuates ulcerative colitis in rats AIM: To investigate the effects of glutamate microinjection into hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats and to explore the relevant mechanisms.METHODS: 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (100 mg/kg in 50% ethanol) was instilled into the colon of adult male SD rats to induce UC. A colonic damage score (CDS) was used to indicate the severity of the colonic mucosal damage. The pathological changes in the colonic mucosa were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, biochemical analyses or ELISA. Ten minutes before UC induction, drugs were microinjected into the relevant nuclei in rat brain to produce chemical stimulation or chemical lesion.RESULTS: Microinjection of glutamate (3, 6 and 12 mug) into the PVN dose-dependently decreased the CDS in UC rats. This protective effect was eliminated after kainic acid (0.3 mug) was microinjected into PVN or into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) that caused chemical lesion of these nuclei. This protective effect was also prevented when the AVP-V1 receptor antagonist DPVDAV (200 ng) was microinjected into the NTS. The discharge frequency of the vagus was markedly decreased following microinjection of glutamate into the PVN. Microinjection of glutamate into the PVN in UC rats significantly increased the cell proliferation and anti-oxidant levels, and decreased the apoptosis and Bax and caspase 3 expression levels and reduced the pro-inflammatory factors in the colonic mucosa.CONCLUSION: The activation of hypothalamic PVN exerts protective effects against UC, which is mediated by the NTS and vagus. The effects may be achieved via anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory factors.",Excluded
2487,"Microglial trogocytosis and the complement system regulate axonal pruning in vivo Partial phagocytosis-called trogocytosis-of axons by microglia has been documented in ex vivo preparations but has not been directly observed in vivo. The mechanisms that modulate microglial trogocytosis of axons and its function in neural circuit development remain poorly understood. Here, we directly observe axon trogocytosis by microglia in vivo in the developing Xenopus laevis retinotectal circuit. We show that microglia regulate pruning of retinal ganglion cell axons and are important for proper behavioral response to dark and bright looming stimuli. Using bioinformatics, we identify amphibian regulator of complement activation 3, a homolog of human CD46, as a neuronally expressed synapse-associated complement inhibitory molecule that inhibits trogocytosis and axonal pruning. Using a membrane-bound complement C3 fusion protein, we demonstrate that enhancing complement activity enhances axonal pruning. Our results support the model that microglia remodel axons via trogocytosis and that neurons can control this process through expression of complement inhibitory proteins.

3180,"Physiological roles of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in Limulus ventral photoreceptors In previous work we have presented evidence for electrogenic Na+/Ca2+ exchange in Limulus ventral photoreceptors (1989. J. Gen. Physiol. 93:473-492). This article assesses the contributions to photoreceptor physiology from Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Four separate physiological processes were considered: maintenance of resting sensitivity, light-induced excitation, light adaptation, and dark adaptation. (a) Resting sensitivity: reduction of [Na+]o caused a [Ca2+]o-dependent reduction in light sensitivity and a speeding of the time courses of the responses to individual test flashes; this effect was dependent on the final value to which [Na+]o was reduced. The desensitization caused by Na+ reduction was dependent on the initial sensitivity of the photoreceptor; in fully dark-adapted conditions no desensitization was observed; in light-adapted conditions, extensive desensitization was observed. (b) Excitation: Na+ reduction in fully dark-adapted conditions caused a Ca2+o-dependent depolarizing phase in the receptor potential that persisted beyond the stimulus duration and was evoked by a bright adapting flash. (c) Light adaptation: the degree of desensitization induced by a bright adapting flash was Na+o dependent, being larger with lower [Na+]o. Na+ reduction enhanced light adaptation only at intensities brighter than 4 x 10(-6) W/cm2. In addition to being Na+o dependent, light adaptation was Ca2+o dependent, being greater at higher [Ca2+]o. (d) Dark adaptation: the recovery of light sensitivity after adapting illumination was Na+o dependent. Dark adaptation after bright illumination in voltage-clamped and in unclamped conditions was faster in normal-Na+ saline than in reduced Na+ saline. The final sensitivity to which photoreceptors recovered was lower in reduced-Na+ saline when bright adapting illumination was used. The results suggest the involvement of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in each of these physiological processes. Na+/Ca2+ exchange may contribute to these processes by counteracting normal elevations in [Ca2+]i.",Excluded
2572,"Androstenes mediated oncophagy of glial and myeloid tumor cells by different mechanisms Cellular death by necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy can be considered as one of host resistance processes. We reported that beta androstene hormones, Dehydroepiandrosterone, Androstenediol and Androstenetriol, up regulate host resistance against lethal infections by bacteria, viruses and restore host myelopoiesis after whole body radiation exposures. In contrast, the a androstenediol (17alphaAED) epimer, mediates host resistance by oncophagy of myeloid, epithelial and brain tumor cells by either apoptotic or autophagy mechanisms. In myeloid tumor cell, 17alphaAED induces apoptosis as shown by TUNEL assay and electron microscopy. 17alphaAED inhibits DNA synthesis in myelocytic leukemia cells whereas 17alphaAED does not. Similarly, l7alphaAED inhibited the proliferation of estrogen receptor positive or negative human mammary carcinomas, but its activity is independent of either estrogen or androgen receptors. 17alphaAED also inhibits proliferation and induces cell death of multiple, unrelated glioma with an IC50 of 8 to 25 ?M. Treatment with 17alphaAED induced autophagosomes and acidic vesicular organelles formation in human malignant glioma. The position of the hydroxyl group on C-17 dictates the anti-tumor activity of the androstenes and must be in the a-configuration, demonstrating a strict structure-activity relationship. Exposure of U937 lymphoma cells to 17alphaAED induces apoptosis without the activation of the autophagic process as determined by the elevated levels of caspase 3 cleavage and PARP processing. In contrast beclin-1 and conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II were evident in T98G glioblastoma cells treated with 17alphaAED. In human glioblastoma 17alphaAED autophagy is induced by PERK/eIF2 signaling mediated ER stress. These findings reveal that the same agent 17alphaAED induces oncophagy in different tumor cells: autophagy in human glioblastoma and apoptosis in human myelocytic leukemia. The target cell determines the oncophagic pathway used.",Excluded
3263,"Trans-synaptic degeneration in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder-evidence of brain parenchymal alterations associated with retinal damage Background and aims: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune disease of the CNS characterized by potentially devastating optic neuritis (ON) and myelitis. Data suggesting cerebral involvement in NMOSD is scarce. Here, we investigate brain parenchymal integrity alterations in NMOSD and their association with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) thinning. Method(s): 21 patients with NMOSD and 21 sex and age matched healthy control (HC) subjects were enrolled. All participants underwent extensive 3T MRI and spectral domain OCT examinations with RNFL and GCL analysis. DTI was analyzed by Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). Result(s): The cohort comprised 21 NMOSD patients including two testing sero-negative for AQP-4 antibodies (90.5 % seropositive). Unilateral optic neuritis (ON) occurred in 27 cases (64%), and 9 patients reported ON of both eyes (42 %). OCT analysis showed a marked reduction of both RNFL and GCL in NMOSD compared to HC. DTI analysis revealed significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) of the optic radiation (OR) in NMOSD compared to HC. Reduced FA correlated with RNFL thickness. Conclusion(s): ON is reflected by structural abnormalities of the OR in NMOSD patients, presumably caused by transsynaptic degeneration within the visual pathway subsequent to ON.",Excluded
2431,"Lack of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) in layer 2/3 interneurons that receive cannabinoid-sensitive inhibitory inputs In layer 2/3 of neocortex, brief trains of action potentials in pyramidal neurons (PNs) induce the mobilization of endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs), resulting in a depression of GABA release from the terminals of inhibitory interneurons (INs). This depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) is mediated by activation of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) on presynaptic terminals of a subset of INs. However, it is not clear whether CB1 receptors are also expressed at synapses between INs, and whether INs can release eCBs in response to depolarization. In the present studies, brain slices containing somatosensory cortex were prepared from 14- to 21-day-old CD-1 mice. Whole cell recordings were obtained from layer 2/3 PNs and from INs classified as regular spiking nonpyramidal, irregular spiking, or fast spiking. For all three classes of INs, the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 suppressed inhibitory synaptic activity, similar to the effect seen in PNs. In addition, trains of action potentials in PNs resulted in significant DSI. In INs, however, DSI was not seen in any cell type, even with prolonged high-frequency spike trains that produced calcium increases comparable to that seen with DSI induction in PNs. In addition, blocking eCB reuptake with AM404, which enhanced DSI in PNs, failed to unmask any DSI in INs. Thus the lack of DSI in INs does not appear to be due to an insufficient increase in intracellular calcium or enhanced reuptake. These results suggest that layer 2/3 INs receive CB1-expressing inhibitory inputs, but that eCBs are not released by these INs.",Excluded

2586,"Creation of endothelial-targeted adenoviral vectors for genetic engineering of the metastatic tumor microenvironment The endothelium is an attractive gene therapy target for metastatic cancer, providing access to systemic tumors. Previous work has focused on either viral entry/attachment (transductional targeting), or cell type specific enhancer promoter vector transgene expression regulation (transcriptional targeting). While previous studies demonstrated endothelial targeting, the tumor wide extent and transgene expression level quantification have been uncertain. Indeed, obtaining robust and stringent tumor expression has been challenging due to: insufficient transduction, focal rather than widespread intratumoral vascular expression, viral particle liver sequestration, and host preformed immunity. We developed a set of adenoviral vectors, containing 3 kb of the human ROBO4 enhancer/promoter, that are expressed at high levels throughout tumor vasculature. We now have three vectors representing four tiers of genetic modification. Transgenes encoding fluorescent proteins allowed us to quantify endothelial expression frequency by image analysis, and expression level using whole tissue Western blotting. Our first vector was Ad5.ROBO4. Compared with Ad5.CMV, Ad5.ROBO4 evidenced complete retargeting from hepatocytes to low-level expression in host organ and tumor endothelial cells. Warfarin-mediated hepatocyte detargeting produced a striking increase in tumor and bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial expression, without change in other host organs. Our second vector is Ad.RGD.H5/H3.ROBO4. Insertion of a cyclized RGD peptide in the fiber/knob HI loop engages enhanced tumor endothelial transduction via alphav/beta3 and alphav/beta5. Swapping hexon hypervariable regions responsible for Ad Type 5-Factor X binding with corresponding regions from serotype 3 enables marked diminution of hepatocyte sequestration. Use of the ROBO4 enhancer promoter produces high-level pan-intratumoral vascular expression particularly in cancers with markedly elevated VEGF production, such as orthotopic and metastatic renal cell carcinoma, orthotopic colonic liver metastases, and prostate cancer bone, brain, and liver metastases. Most striking, was enhancement of Ad.RGD.H5/H3.ROBO4 vector expression within interior tumor regions undergoing hypoxic necrosis; regions notoriously resistant to radiation or chemotherapies. Our third vector contains a polycistronic array, enabling triple transgene expression from a single vector within the tumor vasculature. Thus, we have panel of endothelial-targeted vectors with distinctive vascular tropism for use in cancers metastatic to individual host organs. These vectors enable expression of a palette of transgenes that can manipulate the tumor microenvironment to achieve metastatic growth inhibition alone, or ""staggered"" with chemo- or irradiation therapies.",Excluded
2960,"Headache and sinus mass as presenting features of an aggressive nonfunctional pituitary adenoma Non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) generally are treated surgically and with radiation (XRT) depending on their location and surrounding structures. Residual pituitary adenomas (PA) after treatment may exhibit growth with slow extension into surrounding structures which can take years to occur. Ectopic PA are rare and are mostly located in the sphenoid sinus. Predicting aggressive or malignant behavior in PA remains challenging. A 55-yo AA man with a PMH of a NFPA resected in 2001 and treated with gamma knife radiation to residual tissue, had anterior hypopituitarism, and presented to the ED with left sided headaches worsening over 4 days. Sinus CT scan revealed a new mass extending from the left maxillary sinus into the sella turcica. He had been followed by Endocrinology and Neurosurgery for his thus far stable residual tumor in the left sphenoid sinus as well as hormone requirements. His most recent MRI 2 y before his ED presentation showed the size of the residual tumor at that time being smaller than on prior MRIs. In the ED, neurosurgery colleagues evaluated him and recommended a biopsy of the sinus mass which was performed by Otolaryngology along with a left maxillary sinusotomy, anterior ethmoidectomy, and sphenoidotomy with tissue removal. The bx revealed a recurrence of the NFPA with tumor cells on pathology staining positive for Ki-67 (> 3%) and for p53, suggesting it was more aggressive. The patient's sx improved and he continued hormone replacement therapy with close f/u. This case illustrates the need for longterm follow-up of patients with NFPA, especially after treatment with any form of radiation (1). It further underscores the lack of biomarkers that could reliably assist in predicting which tumors are more likely to recur or become more aggressive including invasion (2). CT and MRI features of sphenoid sinus ectopic PA are well described (3,4). Misdiagnosis (such as olfactory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, paraganglioma, melanoma) of patients with a sinus mass and/or a history of PA should be avoided (5). Surgical removal of residual tumors remains the mainstay of therapy, if feasible. Nonsurgical therapy options are less standardized (1). PA that stain positive for Ki-67 or P53 are more likely to be aggressive than those that do not. Aggressive PA and pituitary carcinomas often require more novel treatments when traditional surgery and XRT fail (6,7).",Excluded

OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the relationship between VitD (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D]) levels and primary brain malignancy. METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective cohort study of veterans who received care through VHA from January 2000 to December 2015 and had their VitD levels measured at least once over the course of their care. Primary outcome measure was the incidence of primary brain malignancy in relation to VitD levels. Exclusion criteria included diagnoses of metastatic brain cancer, meningeal, spinal, face, neck and throat malignancies; VitD measurements in the months of November to February; exposure to ionizing radiation; and presence of genetic factors predisposing to brain tumors formation. Propensity score matching and survival analyses were conducted on the cohorts to determine and compare the incidence and hazard ratios for brain malignancy between two groups of subjects. Group 1: subjects with VitD levels higher than 20 ng/ml; and Group 2: subjects with VitD deficiency defined as <= 20ng/ml. Kaplan Meier curves were plotted to compare the time to events between the groups. RESULT(S): After matching the two groups on several confounders (Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking Status, Alcohol Abuse, Race, Ethnicity), the incidence of primary brain malignancy was significantly higher in Group 2 (384/251,636; 154 per 100,000) in comparison with Group 1 (992/694,707; 143 per 100,000).

In this study, we tested whether Epo could protect the retina from damage induced by a long period of moderate light insult and how it protected. First, rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) by human recombinant Epo at 5000 or 30,000U/kg to assess Epo concentration in plasma and retina. Second, rats were untreated or injected i.p. with Epo at 30,000U/kg, 1 or 4h before being placed in constant light (24h; 2200lux). Electroretinograms (ERG) were recorded before treatment, 1day and 15days (D15) after light exposure. After the last ERG, eyes were taken for histology. In parallel, we tested Epo protection against oxidative stressors on isolated retinas and its effect on caspase-9 activity. Epo injected at 30,000U/kg body weight, 4h before exposure to the damaging light, protected retinal function and structure against light damage and induced an increase in caspase-9 activity and expression. Epo had no direct or indirect protective effect against free radicals-induced death on isolated retinas. Epo protected the retina from a long period of moderate light exposure through a mechanism independent from a free radical scavenging property or an antioxidant facilitating activity. The activation of caspase-9, 4h after Epo injection, corresponding to the start of light exposure, suggests that caspase-9 plays a role in neuroprotection.",Excluded

2954,"Radiation therapy for the treatment of tumours in small companion animals Radiation is becoming widely available to treat tumours in veterinary patients. Orthovoltage machines capable of delivering low energy external beam radiation are less versatile than linear accelerators and cobalt-60 machines that deliver megavoltage radiation. In addition, electron beam capabilities that are available with some linear accelerators allow more targeted treatment in smaller patients. Acute effects of radiation are to be expected, but in nearly all cases such side effects resolve without limiting protocols. In contrast, late effects of radiation are dose limiting and are more likely with higher doses per treatment fraction. Protocols that use smaller doses per fraction have a lower risk of late effects thereby allowing higher total doses to be delivered which leads to higher tumour control rates. It is possible to provide long-term tumour control in cats and dogs using radiation therapy, particularly for mast cell tumours, soft tissue sarcomas, oral tumours and brain tumours in dogs and soft tissue sarcomas and skin tumours in cats.

3032,"Role of immediate-release morphine (MIR) in the treatment of predictable pain in radiotherapy Radiotherapy is crucial in the management of cancer patients in both the curative and palliative settings. However, patients often report pain both during positioning for, and execution of, radiotherapy and this may be a reason for interrupting the radiotherapy session. This observation is common even if the patient is undergoing baseline drug therapy for cancer pain. Recent data suggest that orally administrated immediate-release morphine (MIR) is able to reduce pain in patients with predictable pain. The authors tested a rescue dose of MIR 10 or 20 mg, 20 to 60 minutes before radiotherapy, to verify the effectiveness of MIR in this setting and also to assess the patient's ability to receive the full course of radiotherapy. One hundred forty consecutive patients were evaluated during radiotherapy treatment and visual analogue scale (VAS) and positioning VAS scores were assessed. All patients completed the course of scheduled radiotherapy and pain was well controlled, despite the fact that previous pharmacological treatment had not been able to completely control chronic cancer pain. These data strongly suggest a role for MIR pretreatment in patients with pain due to positioning during radiotherapy.",Excluded
2761,"Acoustic radiation effects on bone conduction threshold measurement UNLABELLED: Acoustic radiation is the sound energy escape from a bone vibrator that may be detected by air conduction mechanisms. The presence of acoustic radiation may result in an unreal bone conduction threshold, promoting an unreal air/bone gap in the high frequencies.AIM: aim to analyze the acoustic radiation effect on the extension of air/bone gap at 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 Hz.MATERIALS AND METHOD: our clinical and experimental study had a sample of 101 individuals, who matched inclusion criteria: to have an air/bone gap higher than 10 dB in the frequencies of 2,000; 3,000 and 4,000 Hz. All of them had their bone conduction threshold measured in two conditions: open ear canal and closed ear canal.RESULTS: we found that major differences between the two conditions evaluated occurred at the 4,000 Hz; data analysis showed significant difference in the extension for the air/bone gap; analysis of the number of cases of mixed hearing loss that changed to sensorineural was significant too.CONCLUSION: These studies concluded that when the MAE is occluded, the acoustic radiation phenomenon is controlled or avoided, enabling bone measures at the frequencies of 3,000 and 4,000Hz to be more accurate.",Excluded
2652,"Baseline characteristics and response to GH replacement of hypopituitary patients previously irradiated for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma: data from the Pfizer International Metabolic Database OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis whether the effects of GH replacement therapy in adults could be affected by prior pituitary irradiation, the baseline characteristics and response to GH were evaluated in adults with severe GH deficiency (GHD), who had received or not irradiation for the treatment of pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma.DESIGN: Data from 447 patients, who had received radiotherapy (427 in addition to surgery), and 630 patients, who were operated on but not irradiated for their tumour, were retrieved from Pfizer International Metabolic Database (KIMS) and compared at baseline and 1 and 2 years following the onset of GH replacement.RESULTS: Irradiated and non-irradiated patients exhibited the expected phenotype of GHD at baseline. However, irradiated patients had a greater impairment in the quality of life (QoL), a higher fat mass, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and a lower bone mineral content (BMC) than non-irradiated patients. Treatment with GH induced similar changes in both groups. After 1 year of GH replacement, there was an increase in serum IGF-I and fat-free mass, a reduction in fat mass and an improvement in QoL, all changes being equivalent in irradiated and non-irradiated patients. The lipid profile also improved with the irradiated patients showing a better response. These beneficial effects were maintained and the BMC also increased in both groups by the second year of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that prior irradiation for pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma does not compromise the beneficial effects of GH replacement therapy.",Included
2654,"Physiological and pathological observations on rat middle cerebral arteries and human AVM tissue cultures following single high-dose gamma irradiation In vitro isometric myograph and histopathological studies were performed on rat middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) to explore changes in contractile capacity following experimental Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Right MCAs were treated with 25 Gy and 50 Gy at the 50% isodose line, while contralateral vessels received 15 Gy and 20 Gy at the 20% isodose region. Survival period varied from 3 to 18 months. Reduction in contractile capacity of irradiated normal rat MCAs was detected but their lumina remained patent. In another study, we investigated human AVM tissue cultures in order to detect genetic and phenotypic modifications contributing to vessel occlusion after irradiation. In culture, the proliferation index decreased considerably following 15-, 20-, 25- or 50-Gy irradiation at the 5th posttreatment day and remained depressed during the observation period of 14 days. P53, p21Waf-1 and mdm-2 mRNA contents were elevated significantly after irradiation, indicating enhanced apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed vigorous vimentin positivity in the nonirradiated control AVM cultures, which gradually decreased by the time in the irradiated specimens. Smooth muscle alpha-actin positivity was prominent in the irradiated cultivated samples, suggesting transformation of resting fibroblasts onto activated myofibroblastic elements with contractile capacity. This transformation process was confirmed by the appearance of TGF-Beta in the irradiated AVM cell lines also. These data support the hypothesis that one of the contributing factors to AVM shrinkage and obliteration after radiosurgery might be fibrocyte-myofibroblastic cell transformation in the vessel wall.",Included
3140,"Seizure control after radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: A 25-year experience OBJECTIVE Seizures are the second-most common presenting symptom in patients with lobar arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, few studies have assessed the long-term effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on seizure control. The authors of this study assess the outcome of SRS for these patients to identify prognostic factors associated with seizure control. METHODS Patients with AVM who presented with a history of seizure and underwent SRS at the authors' institution between 1987 and 2012 were retrospectively assessed. The total cohort included 155 patients with a mean follow-up of 86 months (range 6-295 months). Primary outcomes assessed were seizure frequency, antiepileptic drug regimen, and seizure freedom for 6 months prior to last follow-up. RESULTS Seizure-free status was achieved in 108 patients (70%), with an additional 23 patients (15%) reporting improved seizure frequency as compared to their pre-SRS status. The median time to seizure-free status was estimated to be 12 months (95% CI 0-27 months) as evaluated via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The mean seizure frequency prior to SRS was 14.2 (95% CI 5.4-23.1) episodes per year. Although not all patients tried, the proportion of patients successfully weaned off all antiepileptic drugs was 18% (28/155 patients). On multivariate logistic regression, focal impaired awareness seizure type (also known as complex partial seizures) and superficial venous drainage were significantly associated with a decreased odds ratio for seizure-free status at last follow-up (OR 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.92] for focal impaired awareness seizures; OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.16-0.81] for superficial venous drainage). The effects of superficial venous drainage on seizure outcome were nonsignificant when excluding patients with < 2 years of follow-up. AVM obliteration did not correlate with long-term seizure freedom (p = 0.202, chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that SRS improves long-term seizure control and increases the likelihood of being medication free, independently of AVM obliteration. Patients with focal impaired awareness seizures were less likely to obtain long-term seizure relief. Copyright © AANS 2019",Excluded
3360,"ADAM23: Biomarker for nonmelanoma skin cancer disease progression The ADAMs (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) comprise a family of multidomain transmembrane and secreted proteins involved in cytokine and growth factor release, proteolysis and cell adhesion. Multiple family members have been shown to play a role in cancer formation and disease progression. Decreased ADAM23 expression has been demonstrated in human breast, colon, gastric, head and neck, brain and pancreatic cancers and is believed to be associated with a more malignant or metastatic phenotype. Substantially more than 1 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) occur annually in the United States according to the American Cancer Society. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the two major types of NMSC and most are related to chronic sun exposure. We have demonstrated by microarray analysis that ADAM23 expression is decreased in human keratinocytes chronically irradiated with a solar-simulated light source. Using a human SCC skin carcinogenesis model, we have demonstrated that decreased ADAM23 expression correlates with disease progression. Preliminary immunohistochemical analysis of human SCC samples also demonstrates decreased ADAM23 expression. We believe that ADAM23 may serve as a biomarker of human skin SCC disease progression. This may be important for earlier detection and for the possible development of targeted therapy that may serve as an alternative to potentially disfiguring surgical treatment.",Excluded

3283,"Circadian light input in plants, flies and mammals The rotation of our planet results in daily changes in light and darkness, as well as seasons with characteristic photoperiods. Adaptation to these daily and seasonal changes in light properties (and associated changes in the environment) is important to the sustained survival of higher life forms on our planet. Many organisms use their intrinsic circadian oscillator or clock to orchestrate daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology to adapt to diurnal changes. Some higher organisms use the same oscillator to monitor day length in selecting the appropriate season for reproductive behaviour. Organisms have developed irradiance measurement mechanisms to ignore photic noise (lightning, moonlight), and use the light of dusk and dawn for circadian photoentrainment. They have also devised multiple photoreceptors and signalling cascades to buffer against changes in the spectral composition of natural light. The interaction of the clock with ambient light is, therefore, quite intricate. [References: 31]",Excluded

We applied single dose of 3 Gy 2-3 times weekly and a maximum dose of 24-30 Gy. Follow-up was 2 years and included documentation of subjective discomforts (induration, deviation and painful erection).RESULTS: Induration (27.6%) and deviation (24.1%) of the erected penis are little improved, but in two-third of patients (65%) with painful erection defined relief could be obtained. It could also be shown that patients with short history of symptoms had best chances for a successful treatment. Side effects were not seen.CONCLUSION: In our experience radiotherapy is not suitable for all stages of IPP. Only patients in the early stages of IPP-especially the ones who suffer from painful erection-should be considered suitable for treatment with ionising radiation.",Excluded

2542,"Comparison of four scatter correction methods using Monte Carlo simulated source distributions UNLABELLED: Scatter correction in SPECT is important for improving image quality, boundary detection and the quantification of activity in different regions. This paper presents a comparison of four scatter correction methods, three using more than one energy window and one convolution-subtraction correction method using spatial variant scatter line-spread functions.METHODS: The comparison is based on Monte Carlo simulated data for point sources on- and off-axis, hot and cold spheres of different diameters, and a clinically realistic source distribution simulating brain imaging. All studies were made for a uniform cylindrical water phantom. Since the nature of the detected photon is known with Monte Carlo simulation, separate images of primary and scattered photons can be recorded. These can then be compared with estimated scatter and primary images obtained from the different scatter correction methods. The criteria for comparison were the normalized mean square error, scatter fraction, % recovery and image contrast.RESULTS: All correction methods significantly improved image quality and quantification compared to those obtained with no correction. Quantitatively, no single method was observed to be the best by all criteria for all the source distributions. Three of the methods were observed to perform the best by at least one of the criteria for one of the source distributions. For brain imaging, the differences between all the methods were much less than the difference between them and no correction at all.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that performing scatter correction is essential for accurate quantification, and that all four methods yield a good, but not perfect, scatter correction. Since it is hard to distinguish the methods consistently in terms of their performance, it may be that the choice should be made on the basis of ease of implementation.",Excluded
2541,"The dysbacteriosis of extreme states. [Russian] The study was aimed at investigation of the characteristic features of intestinal dysbacteriosis in man under extreme conditions and development of methods for correcting intestinal microflora for prevention of dysbacteriosis under such conditions. Microbiocenosis of the intestine was investigated in 99 practically healthy persons under model earth conditions and in 34 cosmonauts after space flights of various duration. The following factors influencing intestinal microflora in man under extreme conditions were studied: neuroemotional tension, hypokinesia, increased physical loads, isolation under conditions of altered gaseous environment and microclimate. The study revealed that the above factors participated in development of dysbacteriosis. It was shown that the neuroemotional stress played the main role in development of dysbacteriosis in man under extreme conditions: intestinal microflora responded under extreme conditions by decreased counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli participating in maintenance of the intact ecological barrier and colonization resistance. For preventing dysbacteriotic reactions of intestinal microflora it was recommended to use bifidobacterin tablets.

2612,"Loss of Pde6 reduces cell body Ca(2+) transients within photoreceptors Modulation of Ca(2+) within cells is tightly regulated through complex and dynamic interactions between the plasma membrane and internal compartments. In this study, we exploit in vivo imaging strategies based on genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators to define changes in perikaryal Ca(2+) concentration of intact photoreceptors. We developed double-transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing GCaMP3 in all cones and tdTomato in long-wavelength cones to test the hypothesis that photoreceptor degeneration induced by mutations in the phosphodiesterase-6 (Pde6) gene is driven by excessive [Ca(2+)]i levels within the cell body. Arguing against Ca(2+) overload in Pde6 mutant photoreceptors, simultaneous analysis of cone photoreceptor morphology and Ca(2+) fluxes revealed that degeneration of pde6c(w59) mutant cones, which lack the cone-specific cGMP phosphodiesterase, is not associated with sustained increases in perikaryal [Ca(2+)]i. Analysis of [Ca(2+)]i in dissociated Pde6beta(rd1)mouse rods shows conservation of this finding across vertebrates. In vivo, transient and Pde6-independent Ca(2+) elevations ('flashes') were detected throughout the inner segment and the synapse. As the mutant cells proceeded to degenerate, these Ca(2+) fluxes diminished. This study thus provides insight into Ca(2+) dynamics in a common form of inherited blindness and uncovers a dramatic, light-independent modulation of [Ca(2+)]i that occurs in normal cones.",Excluded

Prolonged survival even with therapy is uncommon. Method(s): We report a case of anaplastic oligodendroglioma metastatic to bone with a dramatic and durable response to temozolomide therapy. A retrospective case review, molecular analysis, and literature search were performed. Result(s): The patient presented with a right frontal mass in 1990. Progression led to resection of the lesion in 1995. Histology revealed an anaplastic oligodendroglioma and the tumour was found to have allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 1p (1p-). He received standard radiation therapy. In 2000 he developed hip and pelvic pain. A bone scan showed multiple skeletal lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed stability of intracranial disease. Resection of one lesion found metastatic anaplastic oligodendroglioma with identical morphology to the patient's original tumour, including glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. The patient was started on standard temozolomide chemotherapy and celecoxib with prompt pain relief, and rapid normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase. He received a total of 12 cycles of combined therapy with no toxicity and no evidence of progression until increasing pain marked disease recurrence. The patient underwent palliative chemo- and radiation therapy but eventually succumbed. Discussion(s): Loss of heterozygosity 1p- is associated with prolonged survival in anaplastic oligodendroglioma and may increase the cumulative risk for development of systemic metastases. We speculate that metastases from oligodendroglioma harbouring loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 1p- retain the chemosensitivity of the initial lesion.",Excluded

Seventy-six SD rats six weeks old were divided into control group (4 animals) and experimental groups (18 different subgroups) with 4 animals for each group. Healthy SD rats were exposed to the 460-480 nm blue light for 3 or 12 hours on three different irradiance of 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) respectively. After recovery in darkness for 4 hours, 24 hours or 3 days, retinal tissue was collected after the eyes were enucleated. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to evaluate the general anatomical changes of the rat retinal layers. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling was performed to detect apoptotic cells and immunofluorescence staining was conducted to illustrate the expression and location of related proteins in Muller cells. The number of ganglion cells was analyzed by one-way ANOVA.RESULTS: No injury was observed in SD rat retina at the irradiance of 0.6 W/m(2). Retinal cells were damaged with irradiance at 10.0 W/m(2), which mainly affected photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells, while Muller cells of retinal inner nuclear layer were also involved. Apoptosis began after 4 hours of exposure and peaked at 24 hours. Moderate damage of retina was observed at the irradiance of 1.5 W/m(2) after 12 hours rather than 3 hours exposure. The number of ganglion cells was significantly different among the different groups 3 days after exposure. When the exposure time was 3 hours, the number of retinal ganglion cells under different irradiance at 0.0, 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) was respectively 41.42 +/- 0.17, 40.58 +/- 0.50, 40.92 +/- 0.32 and 22.83 +/- 0.79 (F = 1305.86, P = 0.000). When the exposure time was 12 hours, the number of retinal ganglion cells under different irradiance at 0.0, 0.6, 1.5 and 10.0 W/m(2) was respectively 41.42 +/- 0.17, 40.83 +/- 0.69, 41.08 +/- 0.17 and 22.75 +/- 0.83 (F = 1095.78, P = 0.000).

Patients with CR at both local as well as distant sites or PR at the local site, but CR at distant sites were randomized 1:1 to two treatment groups (n=287). A total of 287 patients with response were randomized to accelerated hyperfraction thoracic RT (45Gy/1.5 Gy twice daily) plus PE x 4 (144) versus PE x 4 alone without radiation (n=143). The PE doses were similar as in induction. All patients received prophylactic cranial irradiation (25Gy/10 fraction/5/week). The primary endpoint was the comparison of progression free survival (PFS) between the two arms and the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS). All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS version 20.0. Result(s): Baseline characteristics were well balanced. Mean age was 58 years (range 32-69), 78% had ECOG 0-1; 22% ECOG 2.

All were considered to be at high risk for local failure. Seventeen had pathologically confirmed final surgical margins of less than 2 mm or focally positive. Brachytherapy catheter placement and treatment delivery were conducted on an outpatient basis. Preplanning was used to determine optimal catheter positions to enhance dose homogeneity of dose delivery. The total HDR boost dose was 15 Gy delivered in 6 fractions of 2.5 Gy over 3 days. Local control, survival, late toxicities (LENT-SOMA), and cosmetic outcome were recorded in follow-up. In addition, factors potentially influencing cosmesis were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The minimum follow-up is 40 months with a median 50 months. Sixteen patients were alive without disease at last follow-up. There have been no in-breast failures observed. One patient died with brain metastases, and another died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease. Grade 1-2 late toxicities included 39% with hyperpigmentation, 56% with detectable fibrosis, 28% with occasional discomfort, and 11% with visible telangiectasias. Grade 3 toxicity was reported in one patient as persistent discomfort. Sixty-seven percent of patients were considered to have experienced good/excellent cosmetic outcomes. Factors with a direct relationship to adverse cosmetic outcome were extent of surgical defect (p = 0.00001), primary excision volume (p = 0.017), and total excision volume (p = 0.015). Conclusion(s): For high risk patients who may benefit from increased doses, interstitial HDR brachytherapy provides a convenient outpatient method for boosting the lumpectomy cavity following conventional whole breast irradiation without overdosing normal tissues. The fractionation scheme of 15 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 days is well tolerated. The volume of tissue removed from the breast at lumpectomy appears to dominate cosmetic outcome in this group of patients. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
2917,"Bnct combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas INTRODUCTION: Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control. We have often treated RMGs using tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN, we herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT, and evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. METHOD(S): Two cohorts were included. The first and second cohorts were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, and between August 2017 and December 2017, respectively. They were followed by successive BV treatments. The first cohort was composed of 7 patients with RMGs (4 grade 4 and 3 grade 3 cases). The second cohort was composed of 6 patients with RMGs (5 grade 4 and 1 grade 3 cases). They were followed-up to April 2018. RESULT(S): Median OS and PFS after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively in the 1st cohort. Those in the second cohort were not reached. The OS data was compared with RPA classification for RMG as advocated by Carson et al. in a 2007 article in JCO. In both cohorts no symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred if BV could be continued. CTCAE grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments. Totally 11cases' OS in both cohorts were compared using JCO's RPA classification.

CONCLUSION(S): BNCT followed by BV treatments well-prevented or well-controlled BRN with prolonged OS and acceptable incidence of adverse events in our patients with RMG.",Excluded
3006,"Design and evaluation of learning strategies for a group of radiographers in radiostereometric analysis (RSA) Introduction The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a radiostereometric analysis (RSA) program aimed at radiographers in order to increase their cognitive and practical skills, thereby increasing image quality and minimizing exposure repetition. Methods and materials Twenty radiographers were randomized into two identically sized study groups. Training consisted of a theoretical and practical workshop using a phantom. Tests were performed to compare the effect of training to nontraining, and the effect of time duration on the maintenance of RSA skills. The effect of training was measured by a written test and three defined parameters influencing image quality. Results Group A reduced significantly (p < 0.001) by 31.3 mm (21-31%) the distance between the centrum of the prosthesis (CP) and the centrum of the calibration field (CCF) and increased the number of beads (NB) visible by 3.6 (out of 18). A further significant reduction of 5.1 mm (p = 0.023), 1.0 bead more (p < 0.001) and a 2.1 (p = 0.022) point better rotation of the prosthesis (RP) was registered two months later. Group B was tested twice without training and no significant improvement was registered. One month after training group B had experienced overall significant improvement on a par with group A. Conclusion It is realistic to implement an RSA X-ray training program where radiographers significantly improve their theoretical and practical skills in centering the CP closer to the CCF, NB and RP. A duration of up to two months after training does not influence the quality of participants' performance. Copyright © 2017 The College of Radiographers",Excluded

Sediments of water reservoirs are considered to be a source of accumulation of these metals that develop in response to human activities and soil erosion. This study collected 180 samples of the surface sediments of water reservoir 1 at Chahnimeh in Sistan. Efficiency of the ANFIS model was evaluated to estimate the five bonds following the measurement of parameters in the laboratory. The following results were obtained for the parameters: organic carbon (OC) %, 0.31; cation exchange capacity (CEC), 37.07 Cmol kg; total Pb, 25.19 mg/kg; clay %, 45.87; and silt %, 39.02. These parameters were used as input for the training model. In the output layer, lead bonds were chosen as modeling targets in the following way: Pb f1 (4.61); Pb f2 (0.54); Pb f3 (16.28); Pb f4 (3.42); and Pb f5 (0.38) mg/kg. The best input compound in this model was chosen using the gamma test. From a total of 180, 88 data were considered for the model training section.

In contrast to X-ray or Cobalt-60 gamma ray irradiation, IORT with a high-energy electron beam delivered by the Shimadzu 20MeV betatron provides acceptable dose homogeneity with rapid fall-off of the radiation dose beyond the treatment volume. Thus, IORT has the advantage of precise demarcation of the target volume, minimum damage to surrounding normal tissues, and a high absorbed target dose (15-25Gy in 5-10min). On the basis of our experience with 170 patients treated by IORT, we established the treatment indications and method in patients with malignant brain tumours. IORT with a dose of 15-25 Gy was delivered to widely resected tumours followed by external radiation therapy. No acute or subacute complications were observed. Treatment results of 30 patients with glioblastoma treated by IORT (mean 18.3 Gy) combined with external radiation therapy (mean 58.5 Gy) resulted in a median survival of 119 weeks and a 2-year survival rate of 61%.",Excluded
2520,"Preconditioning with bright light evokes a protective response against light damage in the rat retina Constant exposure to bright light induces photoreceptor degeneration and at the same time upregulates the expression of several neurotrophic factors in the retina. At issue is whether the induced neurotrophic factors protect photoreceptors. We used a preconditioning paradigm to show that animals preconditioned with bright light became resistant to subsequent light damage. The preconditioning consisted of a 12-48 hr preexposure, followed by a 48 hr ""rest phase"" of normal cyclic lighting. The greatest protection was achieved by a 12 hr preexposure. Preconditioning induces a prolonged increase in two endogenous neurotrophic factors: basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). It also stimulates the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (Erks) in both photoreceptors and Muller cells. These findings indicate that exposure to bright light initiates two opposing processes: a fast degenerative process that kills photoreceptors and a relatively slower process that leads to the protection of photoreceptors. The extent of light damage, therefore, depends on the interaction of the two processes. These results also suggest a role of endogenous bFGF and CNTF in photoreceptor protection and the importance of Erk activation in photoreceptor survival.",Excluded

Furthermore, we tested whether VAT estimations by these two methods are equivalent in assessing the metabolic risk in this population.DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Data from the Norwegian population of a multicenter study in adults with genetically proven PWS were used. Subjects with complete anthropometry, biochemical, and imagistic measurements at all study visits (baseline and after 12 and 24 months of GH treatment) (n = 14, six men) were included. VAT was quantified both using CT scans (GE Lightspeed 16 Pro) of the abdomen at L2-L3 level and a total body DXA scan (GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy).RESULTS: VAT DXA was strongly associated with VAT CT at baseline (r = 0.97) and after 12 (r = 0.90) and 24 months (r = 0.89) of GH treatment (all P < .001). We found moderate to strong positive correlations between VAT by both methods, and blood pressure, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, glucose metabolism, and other fat depots (arms, legs, android, trunk, total body) but no association with age, gender, blood lipids, and IGF-I. Adiponectin was negatively associated with the amount of VAT. At baseline, the highest correlation with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was found for VAT DXA (r = 0.76, P = .001) and VAT CT (r = 0.75, P = .002), respectively.CONCLUSION: VAT can be accurately estimated by DXA, in patients with PWS, and might contribute to the assessment of the metabolic risk.",Excluded
2535,"Transient fear-induced alterations in evoked release of norepinephrine and GABA in amygdala slices Presentation of a tonal cue that previously had been associated with a fearful experience (footshock) produces alterations in arousal and sleep that occur after the fearful cue is no longer presented. To begin investigating neurochemical mechanisms that may underlie the effects of fearful cue presentation, we measured release of [(3)H]-norepinephrine ([(3)H]-NE]) and [(14)C]-gamma-amino-butyric acid ([(14)C]-GABA) from brain regions known to regulate arousal states and REM sleep. Depolarization-evoked release of [(3)H]-NE from amygdalar slices of mice, which were trained to recognize a tone as a fearful cue, was suppressed at 2-3 h after exposure of animals to the fearful cue, but recovered after 4-5 h. Interestingly, depolarization-evoked release of [(14)C]-GABA was significantly increased in the amygdala, and also showed a tendency for enhancement in the hippocampus, NPO, and DRN at 2-3 h after cue presentation. The changes in [(14)C]-GABA release were also transient; 4-5 h after cue presentation no significant differences were detected between samples derived from experimental groups which experienced fearful or neutral cues. The similar time course of fearful cue-induced changes in neurotransmitter release and changes in arousal and REM sleep suggests that alterations in amygdalar neurotransmission may be involved in the changes in arousal and sleep that occur after fear.",Excluded
3620,"Load Dependency of Postural Control--Kinematic and Neuromuscular Changes in Response to over and under Load Conditions INTRODUCTION: Load variation is associated with changes in joint torque and compensatory reflex activation and thus, has a considerable impact on balance control. Previous studies dealing with over (OL) and under loading (UL) used water buoyancy or additional weight with the side effects of increased friction and inertia, resulting in substantially modified test paradigms. The purpose of this study was to identify gravity-induced load dependency of postural control in comparable experimental conditions and to determine the underlying neuromuscular mechanisms.METHODS: Balance performance was recorded under normal loading (NL, 1 g), UL (0.16 g 0.38 g) and OL (1.8 g) in monopedal stance. Center of pressure (COP) displacement and frequency distribution (low 0.15-0.5 Hz (LF), medium 0.5-2 Hz (MF), high 2-6 Hz (HF)) as well as ankle, knee and hip joint kinematics were assessed. Soleus spinal excitability was determined by H/M-recruitment curves (H/M-ratios).RESULTS: Compared to NL, OL caused an increase in ankle joint excursion, COP HF domain and H/M-ratio. Concomitantly, hip joint excursion and COP LF decreased. Compared to NL, UL caused modulations in the opposite direction: UL decreased ankle joint excursions, COP HF and H/M-ratio. Collaterally, hip joint excursion and COP LF increased. COP was augmented both in UL and in OL compared to NL.CONCLUSION: Subjects achieved postural stability in OL and UL with greater difficulty compared to NL. Reduced postural control was accompanied by modified balance strategies and compensatory reflex activation. With increasing load, a shift from hip to ankle strategy was observed. Accompanying, COP frequency distribution shifted from LF to HF and spinal excitability was enhanced. It is suggested that in OL, augmented ankle joint torques are compensated by quick reflex-induced postural reactions in distal muscles. Contrarily, UL is associated with diminished joint torques and thus, postural equilibrium may be controlled by the proximal segments to adjust the center of gravity above the base of support.",Excluded
2931,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutant glioblastomas demonstrate a decreased rate of pseudoprogression: A multi-institutional experience Background: Pseudoprogression (psPD) represents false radiologic evidence of tumor progression and is observed in some glioblastoma (GBM) patients after postoperative chemoradiation (CRT) with temozolomide (TMZ). The ambiguity of the psPD diagnosis confounds identification of true progression and may lead to unnecessary interventions. The association between psPD and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutational (mut) status is understudied, and its incidence may alter clinical decision making. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated 120 patients with IDH1-mut (n = 60) and IDH1-wild-type (IDH-WT; [n = 60]) GBMs who received postoperative CRT with TMZ at 4 academic institutions. Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria were used to identify psPD rates in routine brain MRIs performed up to 90 days after CRT completion. Result(s): Within 90 days of completing CRT, 9 GBM patients (1 [1.7%] IDH1-mut and 8 [13.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated true progression, whereas 17 patients (3 [5%] IDH1-muts and 14 [23.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated psPD (P =. 004). IDH1-mut GBMs had a lower probability of psPD (hazard ratio: 0.173, 95% CI, 0.047-0.638, P =. 008). Among the patients with radiologic signs suggestive of progression (n = 26), psPD was found to be the cause in 3 of 4 (75.0%) of the IDH1-mut GBMs and 14 of 22 (63.6%) of the IDH1-WT GBMs (P =. 496). Median overall survival for IDH1-mut and IDH1-WT GBM patients was 40.3 and 23.0 months, respectively (P <. 001). Conclusion(s): IDH1-mut GBM patients demonstrate lower absolute rates of psPD expression. Irrespective of GBM subtype, psPD expression was more likely than true progression within 90 days of completing CRT. Continuing adjuvant treatment for IDH1-mut GBMs is suggested if radiologic progression is suspected during this time interval. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

3603,"Comet assay as a useful tool to assess brain damage DNA damage could be defined as any modification of DNA that changes its coding properties. There are two main mechanisms inducing damage to the structure of DNA: (1) spontaneous damage caused by sources within a cell and (2) damage caused by external sources such as chemicals and radiation. Protracted oxidative, hydrolytic, deamination or alkylation reactions can modify DNA bases, or even sometimes cause a complete loss of bases within DNA, resulting in strand breakage. In the same way, cellular DNA can be damaged by external sources such as ultraviolet or ionizing radiation and a variety of chemical substances can induce interstrand and intrastrand cross-links, DNA-protein cross-links, bulky DNA adducts, single strand breaks (SSBs) and double strand breaks (DSBs). The human genome is constantly exposed to many classes of genotoxins and the central nervous system is sensitive to oxidative damage. Deficiency in repair of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage has been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders. DNA damage measurement in any cell or tissue is a significant indicator of a stable or unstable nature of the genomic apparatus, which would reveal physiological health status of a single cell and a whole organism. A number of techniques to detect DNA damage have been used to identify substances with genotoxic activity. The most useful approach to assess DNA damage seems to be the single-cell gel (SCG) or also named Comet assay. This is a simple, rapid, and sensitive technique for the analysis of DNA damage in all cell types, which combine DNA gel electrophoresis with fluorescence microscopy to visualize the migration of DNA strands from individual agarose-embedded cells. Determination of the relative amount of DNA that migrates provided an easy way to evaluate the number of DNA breaks in an individual cell. Since its development in 1984, the Comet assay has been modified at various steps to make it suitable for assessing various kinds of damage in different cells. It is now a tool used extensively to assess DNA damage and repair. Since the introduction of the Alkaline Comet assay, in 1988, the extent of applications and the number of investigators using this technique have increased almost exponentially. This assay has developed into a vital tool for use by investigators interested in research areas ranging from human and environmental biomonitoring to DNA repair processes and genetic toxicology. The Comet assay has been used as a test to predict the risk of development of some diseases related to a higher susceptibility of the individual to DNA damage. This chapter reviews critically the use of the Comet assay to evaluate brain damage. © Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Excluded

However, normal resistance was regained if the differentiated cells were allowed to proceed to the next G1 phase of the cell-cycle before irradiation.

To conclude our studies of neurodegeneration in rat CNS during ACR neurotoxicity, a cupric silver stain method was used to define spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell body, dendrite, axon and terminal argyrophilia in forebrain regions and nuclei. Rats were exposed to ACR at a dose-rate of either 50 mg/kg per day (i.p.) or 21 mg/kg per day (p.o.) and at selected times brains were removed and processed for silver staining. Results show that intoxication at either ACR dose-rate produced a terminalopathy, i.e. nerve terminal degeneration and swelling were present in the absence of significant argyrophilic changes in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites or axons. Exposure to the higher ACR dose-rate caused early onset (day 5), widespread nerve terminal degeneration in most of the major forebrain areas, e.g. cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia. At the lower dose-rate, nerve terminal degeneration in the forebrain developed early (day 7) but exhibited a relatively limited spatial distribution, i.e. anteroventral thalamic nucleus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Several hippocampal regions were affected at a later time point (day 28), i.e. CA1 field and subicular complex. At both dose-rates, argyrophilic changes in forebrain nerve terminals developed prior to the onset of significant gait abnormalities. Thus, in forebrain, ACR intoxication produced a pure terminalopathy that developed prior to the onset of significant neurological changes and progressed as a function of exposure. Neither dose-rate used in this study was associated with axon degeneration in any forebrain region. Our findings indicate that nerve terminals were selectively affected in forebrain areas and, therefore, might be primary sites of ACR action.",Excluded
3457,"Muscle injury following experimental intraoperative irradiation The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Included
2621,"Color constancy of color-deficient observers under illuminations defined by individual color discrimination ellipsoids We explored the color constancy mechanisms of color-deficient observers under red, green, blue, and yellow illuminations. The red and green illuminations were defined individually by the longer axis of the color discrimination ellipsoid measured by the Cambridge Colour Test. Four dichromats (3 protanopes and 1 deuteranope), two anomalous trichromats (2 deuteranomalous observers), and five color-normal observers were asked to complete the color constancy task by making a simultaneous paper match under asymmetrical illuminations in haploscopic view on a monitor. The von Kries adaptation model was applied to estimate the cone responses. The model fits showed that for all color-deficient observers under all illuminations, the adjustment of the S-cone response or blue-yellow chromatically opponent responses modeled with the simple assumption of cone deletion in a certain type (S-M, S-L or S-(L+M)) was consistent with the principle of the von Kries model. The degree of adaptation was similar to that of color-normal observers. The results indicate that the color constancy of color-deficient observers is mediated by the simplified blue-yellow color system with a von Kries-type adaptation effect, even in the case of brightness match, as well as by a possible cone-level adaptation to the S-cone when the illumination produces a strong S-cone stimulation, such as blue illumination.",Excluded
2989,"[Role of radiotherapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma] BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in multiple myeloma; but there are no curative options. Therefore, the treatment rationale is characterized by reduction of symptoms and inhibition of complications. Regarding reduction of pain, treatment of (impending) fractures, and spinal cord compression radiation is an important part of palliative treatment. In our retrospective study we report the effect of radiotherapy on reduction of pain, recalcification and the reduction of neurological symptoms and evaluate factors which have an impact on therapeutic outcome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1, Jan 1988 to 31, Dec 1998, 42 patients (19 women, 23 men; range of ages 46 to 85 years, median age 64.9 years) with 71 target volumes were irradiated (median dose 36 Gy, 2 to 3 Gy 5 times/week) because of symptomatic disease (67/71: osseous pain, 45/71: fractures/impending fractures, 13/71: spinal cord compression) (Tables 1 and 2). The median time from diagnosis to the first course of radiotherapy was 11.9 months (0.3 to 90 months). At the time of first irradiation, 5 and 37 patients were in tumor Stage II and III (Salmon/Durie), respectively. The median value of the Karnofsky performance was 70% (40 to 90%).RESULTS: During follow-up (at least 6 months) in 85% of target volumes complete and partial pain relief (measured by patients' perception and the use of analgetic medication) was achieved; recurrences were seen in 8.8%. In 26/56 (46.4%) lesions evaluable a recalcification was seen whereas 17.9% showed progressive disease (comparison of radiographs before and after radiation). In 22.3% of all lesions initially with impending fracture (4/18) radiotherapy failed because of fracture after treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Simultaneous chemotherapy and a Karnofsky performance > or = 70 had a significant impact on a positive response to treatment, respectively. Spinal cord compression symptoms were reduced in 7/13 (53.8%) of patients (scaled due to the classification by Findlay 1987). The median survival from diagnosis for the entire group was 34.9 months (7.5 to 119.3 months), after irradiation 13.1 months (0.2 to 105.3 months) (Figure 1).CONCLUSION: When adequately indicated radiotherapy has shown to be an effective palliative treatment. Taking under consideration that the results are retrospective we suppose that in multiple myeloma the local response to radiation is supported by a favorable performance status and simultaneous chemotherapy. Irradiation treatment does not change prognosis regarding overall survival.",Excluded

All of these patients were male, with an average age of 59.3 years. The duration of the disease from initial diagnosis was 2-10 years (mean 6.8 years). All had failed or had serious side effects with antiparkinsonian medicine. Seven cases had tremor-dominant symptoms, while the other had mainly rigidity. Six cases had bilateral symptoms. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken prior to treatment in all cases to exclude focal brain lesions. Stereotactic MRI was taken with the Leksell frame in place and both T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained. The targets were located in the area of Vim/Voa/Vop based on the Schaltenbrand atlas. In seven cases, two plugged 4-mm-collimator shots were used. The maximum dose was 160 Gy in six cases and 180 Gy in one case. In another case, a single 4-mm-collimator shot was used, and a maximum dose of 160 Gy was delivered to the target center. The border of the internal capsule was outside the 20-30% isodose line. We intended the 50% isodose line to have an oval-shaped region with the use of two shots and should correspond to the shape of Vim. Follow-up data were available for six patients (mean: 4.5 months, range: 2-9 months). Tremor disappeared in three cases and improved in the other three. In one of these six cases, the tremor disappeared just 3 days after gamma thalamotomy. Rigidity improved in four of these six cases. In only one patient, treated with a maximum dose of 180 Gy, was there any contralateral limb weakness, which developed 3 months after treatment and has been recovering gradually.

2868,"Prox1-positive cells monitor and sustain the murine intestinal epithelial cholinergic niche The enteric neurotransmitter acetylcholine governs important intestinal epithelial secretory and immune functions through its actions on epithelial muscarinic Gq-coupled receptors such as M3R. Its role in the regulation of intestinal stem cell function and differentiation, however, has not been clarified. Here, we find that nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonism in mice as well as epithelial-specific ablation of M3R induces a selective expansion of DCLK1-positive tuft cells, suggesting a model of feedback inhibition. Cholinergic blockade reduces Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cell tracing and cell number. In contrast, Prox1-positive endocrine cells appear as primary sensors of cholinergic blockade inducing the expansion of tuft cells, which adopt an enteroendocrine phenotype and contribute to increased mucosal levels of acetylcholine. This compensatory mechanism is lost with acute irradiation injury, resulting in a paucity of tuft cells and acetylcholine production. Thus, enteroendocrine tuft cells appear essential to maintain epithelial homeostasis following modifications of the cholinergic intestinal niche. Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

In one experiment, the burst-firing pattern was presented once every 4 s for 30 min and restricted to the positive polarity, negative polarity or a bipolar equivalent. The strongest analgesia occurred when the burst-firing pattern was presented with positive polarity or as the typical bipolar signal. Administrations of the burst-firing pattern once per week for four consecutive weeks produced analgesia that was clearly evident during the first, third, and fourth weeks but not during the second week of treatment. A telephone sensor coil (that can be readily obtained from local electronic shops) was then used instead of the solenoids along with an audio (.wav) file to generate the magnetic field; the analgesia was still apparent. However, when the magnetic pattern was generated from a compact disc source the analgesia was not evoked.

This issue has been studied successfully by adapting the use of X-irradiation to manipulate division of non-neuronal cells associated with the injured nerve. The regenerative capacity of the goldfish retinal ganglion cells was determined subsequent to the X-ray treatment. In this work we present an analysis of the molecular events associated with regeneration and enhanced regenerative capacity which follows X-irradiation. Under normal conditions the non-neuronal cells surrounding an intact nerve released axonal growth inhibitors, the level of which was only slightly sensitive to X-irradiation. In contrast, regenerating nerves showed a marked decrease in substances having an inhibitory effect on sprouting in vitro. Moreover, their level was significantly reduced following X-irradiation which was accompanied by increased accumulation of fibrous collagen adjacent to astrocytes. The alteration in the reciprocal relationship between the axon and the surrounding non-neuronal cells was also manifested by changes in the profile of labeled proteins released by the non-neuronal cells. The results of this work, therefore, indicate the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells to the environment provided by the cells surrounding the regenerating fibers and thus may open a new perspective relating to the capacity of neurons to regenerate.",Included
3237,"Autophagy in normal tissues of camel (Camelus dromedarius) with focus on immunoexpression of LC3 and LC3B Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular pathway for degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic protein aggregates and entire organelles. The autophagic pathway is stimulated by nutrient starvation, which prompted us to study the desert camel. Various organs of the camel undergo ecological and physiological stress due to food and water deprivation, dehydration and long exposure to solar radiation. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of specific biomarkers of autophagy under normal conditions as a baseline for later work on stressed individuals. The autophagy-specific biomarkers, microtubule-associated protein1 light chain 3 (LC3), and its cleaved variant, LC3B, were strongly expressed in the cytosol of all tissues examined. The cytosolic immunoreactivity of LC3 was relatively weak, diffuse and vacuolar, while that of LC3B was stronger, punctate and at lower levels. LC3 appears to be associated with the autophagosomal membranes, either free or lysosome-bounded. LC3B is specific for the autophagosome-lysosome complexes and their degraded, granular contents. Autophagy was strongly expressed in CNS neurons and intestinal neural elements, which suggests a protective function for the nervous system.

3236,"Evaluation of intratumoral administration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in patients with malignant glioma Background: This study assessed safety and efficacy for intratumoral administration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-SAM2) into the post-operative tumor cavity through an Ommaya reservoir for patients with malignant glioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Seven patients with malignant glioma, comprising 3 cases with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 3 cases with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and 1 case with malignant ependymoma (ME) were included in the study. All patients were pathologically diagnosed and initially treated with adjuvant therapy (radiation and/or ranimustine and/or systemic TNF-SAM2 infusion) following surgical resection. TNF-SAM2 was administrated into the post-operative tumor cavity through a reservoir at a concentration of 1x10<sup>4</sup> U/body when recurrence was detected, or as initial induction therapy concomitant with radiotherapy. Result(s): Partial response to this regional immunotherapy was seen in 4 out of 7 patients, and 1 patient with GBM has remained clinically stable for >184 weeks without tumor progression. With AA, 2 cases appeared to display slowed advance and longer times to tumor recurrence or regrowth. No serious adverse effects, such as brain edema, hemorrhage or seizure were observed, nor systemic toxicities.

3449,"C6 cells cross-resistant to cisplatin and radiation Malignant gliomas are relatively resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. To investigate whether cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), CDDP) causes resistance we pretreated C6 cells with 10(-6) M CDDP for 24 hours and then tested their sensitivity in a colorimetric assay. Pretreated cells developed resistance to CDDP (resistance factor 2.0) and radiation (survival after 9 Gy 60Co: 36.4% +/- 5.5 versus 28.6% +/- 5.2, p = 0.005). Glutathione levels of pretreated cells were higher (51.7 +/- 13.8 ng/mg protein) than in wt cells (40.4 +/- 13.2, p = 0.029). Addressing the mechanisms we established 4 wild type subclones with different CDDP sensitivities. However, cross-resistance to CDDP (survival: 60.7% +/- 3.5 versus 7.2% +/- 0.5, respectively p = < 0.001) and radiation (29.7% +/- 2.6 versus 12.9% +/- 0.8, p = < 0.001) could also be induced in a subclone showing involvement of mutation.

3537,"A tracking system to calculate patient skin dose in real-time during neurointerventional procedures using a biplane x-ray imaging system Purpose: Neurovascular interventional procedures using biplane fluoroscopic imaging systems can lead to increased risk of radiation-induced skin injuries. The authors developed a biplane dose tracking system (Biplane-DTS) to calculate the cumulative skin dose distribution from the frontal and lateral x-ray tubes and display it in real-time as a color-coded map on a 3D graphic of the patient for immediate feedback to the physician. The agreement of the calculated values with the dose measured on phantoms was evaluated. Method(s): The Biplane-DTS consists of multiple components including 3D graphic models of the imaging system and patient, an interactive graphical user interface, a data acquisition module to collect geometry and exposure parameters, the computer graphics processing unit, and functions for determining which parts of the patient graphic skin surface are within the beam and for calculating dose. The dose is calculated to individual points on the patient graphic using premeasured calibration files of entrance skin dose per mAs including backscatter; corrections are applied for field area, distance from the focal spot and patient table and pad attenuation when appropriate. The agreement of the calculated patient skin dose and its spatial distribution with measured values was evaluated in 2D and 3D for simulated procedure conditions using a PMMA block phantom and an SK-150 head phantom, respectively. Dose values calculated by the Biplane-DTS were compared to the measurements made on the phantom surface with radiochromic film and a calibrated ionization chamber, which was also used to calibrate the DTS. The agreement with measurements was specifically evaluated with variation in kVp, gantry angle, and field size. Result(s): The dose tracking system that was developed is able to acquire data from the two x-ray gantries on a biplane imaging system and calculate the skin dose for each exposure pulse to those vertices of a patient graphic that are determined to be in the beam. The calculations are done in real-time with a typical graphic update time of 30 ms and an average vertex separation of 3 mm.With appropriate corrections applied, the Biplane-DTS was able to determine the entrance dose within 6% and the spatial distribution of the dose within 4% compared to the measurements with the ionization chamber and film for the SK150 head phantom. The cumulative dose for overlapping fields from both gantries showed similar agreement. Conclusion(s): The Biplane-DTS can provide a good estimate of the peak skin dose and cumulative skin dose distribution during biplane neurointerventional procedures. Real-time display of this information should help the physician manage patient dose to reduce the risk of radiation-induced skin injuries.

3573,"Dosimetric, radiobiological and secondary cancer risk evaluation in head-and-neck three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, and volumetric modulated arc therapy: A phantom study This analysis estimated secondary cancer risks after volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and compared those risks to the risks associated with other modalities of head-and-neck (H&N) radiotherapy. Images of H&N anthropomorphic phantom were acquired with a computed tomography scanner and exported via digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) standards to a treatment planning system. Treatment plans were performed using a VMAT dual-arc technique, a nine-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique, and a four-field three-dimensional conformal therapy (3DCRT) technique. The prescription dose was 66.0 Gy for all three techniques, but to accommodate the range of dosimeter responses, we delivered a single dose of 6.60 Gy to the isocenter. The lifetime risk for secondary cancers was estimated according to National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report 116. VMAT delivered the lowest maximum doses to esophagus (23 Gy), and normal brain (40 Gy). In comparison, maximum doses for 3DCRT were 74% and 40%, higher than those for VMAT for the esophagus, and normal brain, respectively. The normal tissue complication probability and equivalent uniform dose for the brain (2.1%, 0.9%, 0.8% and 3.8 Gy, 2.6 Gy, 2.3 Gy) and esophagus (4.2%, 0.7%, 0.4% and 3.7 Gy, 2.2 Gy, 1.8 Gy) were calculated for the 3DCRT, IMRT and VMAT respectively. Fractional esophagus OAR volumes receiving more than 20 Gy were 3.6% for VMAT, 23.6% for IMRT, and 100% for 3DCRT. The calculations for mean doses, NTCP, EUD and OAR volumes suggest that the risk of secondary cancer induction after VMAT is lower than after IMRT and 3DCRT.

3094,"Repeated cocaine administration increases voltage-sensitive calcium currents in response to membrane depolarization in medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a critical role in cocaine addiction. However, evidence to elucidate how the mPFC is functionally involved in cocaine addiction remains incomplete. Recent studies have revealed that repeated cocaine administration induces various neuroadaptations in pyramidal mPFC neurons, including a reduction in voltage-gated K+ currents (VGKCs) and a possible increase in voltage-sensitive Ca2+ currents (I(Ca)). Here, we performed both current-clamp recordings in brain slices and voltage-clamp recordings in freshly dissociated cells to determine whether I(Ca) is altered in mPFC pyramidal neurons after chronic cocaine treatment with a short-term or long-term withdrawal. In addition, a critical role of VGKCs in regulating the generation of Ca2+ plateau potential was also studied in mPFC neurons. Repeated cocaine administration significantly prolonged the duration of evoked Ca2+ plateau potentials and increased the whole-cell I(Ca) in mPFC neurons after a 3 d withdrawal. Selective blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels by nifedipine not only significantly increased the threshold but also reduced the duration and amplitude of Ca2+ plateau potentials in both saline- and cocaine-withdrawn mPFC neurons. However, there was no significant difference in the increased threshold, reduced duration, and decreased amplitude of Ca2+ potentials between saline- and cocaine-withdrawn neurons after blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels. Moreover, an increase in amplitude was also observed, whereas the prolonged duration persisted, in Ca2+ potentials after 2-3 weeks of withdrawal. These findings indicate that chronic exposure to cocaine facilitates the responsiveness of I(Ca), particularly via the activated L-type Ca2+ channels, to excitatory stimuli in rat mPFC pyramidal neurons.",Excluded

3175,"Iodinated contrast agent time course in human brain metastasis: A study for synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy clinical trials Purpose/Objective(s): Synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy (SSRT) is an innovative treatment combining the selective accumulation of heavy elements in tumors with stereotactic irradiations using monochromatic medium energy x-rays from a synchrotron source. Phase I/II clinical trials on brain metastasis are underway using venous infusion of iodinated contrast agents. The radiation dose enhancement depends on the amount of iodine in the tumor and its time course. Quantitative, post-infusion iodine bio-distribution and associated brain perfusion parameters were studied in human brain metastasis as key parameters for treatment feasibility and quality. The reproducibility of iodine concentrations between the recruitment day and the treatment day was assessed in order to predict dose errors. Materials/Methods: Twelve patients received an intravenous bolus of iodinated contrast agent (40 mL, 4 mL/s), followed by a steady-state infusion (160 mL, 0.5 mL/s) in order to ensure stable intratumoral amounts of iodine during the treatment. Absolute iodine concentrations and quantitative perfusion maps were derived from 40 multi-slice dynamic conventional CT images of the brain (recruitment day) or from quantitative synchrotron radiation CT (treatment day). For three of these patients, iodine concentrations reached in the tumor were compared between the recruitment day and the treatment day (~ 10 days interval). Result(s): The post-infusion mean intratumoral iodine concentration (over thirty minutes) reached 1.94 +/- 0.12 mg/mL. Reasonable correlations were obtained between these concentrations and the permeability surface area product and the cerebral blood volume. Iodine concentrations were reproducible leading to dose errors in the radiotherapy standards. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study of contrast agent biodistribution versus time in brain metastasis. The study demonstrates that suitable and stable amounts of iodine can be reached in brain metastasis for SSRT treatment. Moreover, the associated perfusion measurements provide useful information for the patient recruitment and management processes.",Excluded

3188,"Effect of jump exercise training on long-term head-down bed rest-induced cerebral blood flow responses in arteries and veins New Findings: What is the central question of this study? What is the effect of an exercise countermeasure on microgravity-induced change in cerebral blood flow? What is the main finding and its importance? Jump exercise training as a countermeasure did not modify the heterogeneous cerebral blood flow response to head-down bed rest, suggesting that this method is effective in preventing cardiovascular system deconditioning but is not good for cerebral haemodynamics. Abstract: This study aimed to examine the effect of an exercise countermeasure on cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to long-term -6degree head-down bed rest (HDBR) in all cerebral arteries and veins. Twenty male volunteers were exposed to HDBR for 60 days with (training group, n = 10) or without (control group, n = 10) jump exercise training as a countermeasure to spaceflight. The blood flow in the neck conduit arteries (internal carotid and vertebral artery; ICA and VA) and veins (internal jugular and vertebral veins; IJV and VV) was measured, using ultrasonography before (baseline) HDBR, on the 30th and 57th day of HDBR. Long-term HDBR causes a heterogeneous CBF response between the anterior and the posterior brain or between arteries and veins. Long-term HDBR decreased anterior cerebral arterial and venous blood flow, while posterior cerebral arterial and venous blood flows were well maintained. However, exercise jump training did not change each arterial and venous CBF responses to HDBR (control vs. training; ICA, P = 0.643; VA, P = 0.542; external carotid artery, P = 0.644; IJV, P = 0.980; VV, P = 0.999). These findings suggest that jump exercise training did not modify the heterogeneous CBF response to long-term HDBR. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

2882,"Focused ultrasound-mediated suppression of chemically-induced acute epileptic EEG activity BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is attributed to uncontrollable abnormal hyper-excitability of neurons. We investigated the feasibility of using low-intensity, pulsed radiation of focused ultrasound (FUS) to non-invasively suppress epileptic activity in an animal model (rat), which was induced by the intraperitonial injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ).RESULTS: After the onset of induced seizures, FUS was transcranially administered to the brain twice for three minutes each while undergoing electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. An air-backed, spherical segment ultrasound transducer (diameter: 6 cm; radius-of-curvature: 7 cm) operating at a fundamental frequency of 690 KHz was used to deliver a train of 0.5 msec-long pulses of sonication at a repetitive rate of 100 Hz to the thalamic areas of the brain. The acoustic intensity (130 mW/cm2) used in the experiment was sufficiently within the range of safety guidelines for the clinical ultrasound imaging. The occurrence of epileptic EEG bursts from epilepsy-induced rats significantly decreased after sonication when it was compared to the pre-sonication epileptic state. The PTZ-induced control group that did not receive any sonication showed a sustained number of epileptic EEG signal bursts. The animals that underwent sonication also showed less severe epileptic behavior, as assessed by the Racine score. Histological analysis confirmed that the sonication did not cause any damage to the brain tissue.CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that low-intensity, pulsed FUS sonication suppressed the number of epileptic signal bursts using acute epilepsy model in animal. Due to its non-invasiveness and spatial selectivity, FUS may offer new perspectives for a possible non-invasive treatment of epilepsy.",Excluded

3508,"Interaction between age of irradiation and age of testing in the disruption of operant performance using a ground-based model for exposure to cosmic rays Previous research has shown a progressive deterioration in cognitive performance in rats exposed to (56)Fe particles as a function of age. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of age of irradiation independently of the age of testing. Male Fischer-344 rats, 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age, were exposed to 25-200 cGy of (56)Fe particles (1,000 MeV/n). Following irradiation, the rats were trained to make an operant response on an ascending fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule. When performance was evaluated as a function of both age of irradiation and testing, the results showed a significant effect of age on the dose needed to produce a performance decrement, such that older rats exposed to lower doses of (56)Fe particles showed a performance decrement compared to younger rats. When performance was evaluated as a function of age of irradiation with the age of testing held constant, the results indicated that age of irradiation was a significant factor influencing operant responding, such that older rats tested at similar ages and exposed to similar doses of (56)Fe particles showed similar performance decrements. The results are interpreted as indicating that the performance decrement is not a function of age per se, but instead is dependent upon an interaction between the age of irradiation, the age of testing, and exposure to HZE particles. The nature of these effects and how age of irradiation affects cognitive performance after an interval of 15 to 16 months remains to be established.",Included
3002,"Experimental and preclinical tools to explore the main neurological impacts of brain irradiation: Current insights and perspectives Radiation therapy is a powerful tool in the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the brain. However, brain tissue tolerance is limited, and radiation doses must be tailored to minimize deleterious effects on the nervous system.

Improving the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced neurological defects first needs to better characterize radiation injuries in brain cells and tissues. Rodent models have been widely used for this. Here, observations from patients will be reviewed briefly as an introduction, mainly regarding clinical cognitive defects and anatomical alterations using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This limited descriptive clinical knowledge addresses many questions that arise in preclinical models regarding understanding the mechanism of radiation-induced brain dysfunction.

These inclusion bodies are often immunoreactive for Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and are implicated in the pathology of ALS. On the basis of this and a similar clinical presentation of symptoms in the familial (fALS) and sporadic forms of ALS, we sought to investigate the possibility that there exists a common disease-related aggregation pathway for fALS-associated mutant SODs and wild type SOD1. We have previously shown that oxidation of fALS-associated mutant SODs produces aggregates that have the same morphological, structural, and tinctorial features as those found in SOD1 inclusion bodies in ALS. Here, we show that oxidative damage of wild type SOD at physiological concentrations ( approximately 40 microm) results in destabilization and aggregation in vitro. Oxidation of either mutant or wild type SOD1 causes the enzyme to dissociate to monomers prior to aggregation. Only small changes in secondary and tertiary structure are associated with monomer formation. These results indicate a common aggregation prone monomeric intermediate for wild type and fALS-associated mutant SODs and provides a link between sporadic and familial ALS.",Excluded
2775,"Gamma Knife surgery for adrenocorticotropic hormone-producing pituitary adenomas after bilateral adrenalectomy OBJECT: Patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas may require a bilateral adrenalectomy to treat their Cushing's disease. Approximately one third of these patients, however, will experience progressive enlargement of the residual pituitary adenoma, develop hyperpigmentation, and have an elevated level of serum ACTH. These patients with Nelson's syndrome can be treated with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS).METHODS: The prospectively collected University of Virginia Gamma Knife database of patients with pituitary adenomas was reviewed to identify all individuals with Nelson's syndrome who were treated with GKS. Twenty-three patients with a minimum of 6 months of follow up were identified in the database. These patients were assessed for tumor control (that is, lack of tumor growth over time) with neuroimaging studies (median follow-up duration 22 months) and for biochemical normalization of their ACTH levels (median follow-up duration 50 months). Neuroimaging follow-up studies were available for 22 patients, and endocrine follow up was available for 15 patients in whom elevation of ACTH levels was documented prior to GKS. In the 22 patients in whom neuroimaging follow-up studies were available, 12 had a decrease in tumor size, eight had no tumor growth, and two had an increase in tumor volume. Ten of 15 patients with elevated ACTH levels prior to GKS showed a decrease in their ACTH levels at last follow up; three of these 10 patients achieved normal ACTH levels (< 50 pg/ml) and the other five patients with initially elevated values had an increase in ACTH levels. Ten patients were thoroughly evaluated for post-GKS pituitary function; four were found to have new pituitary hormone deficiency and six did not have hypopituitarism after GKS. One patient suffered a permanent third cranial nerve palsy and four patients are now deceased.CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery may control the residual pituitary adenoma and decrease ACTH levels in patients with Nelson's syndrome. Delayed hypopituitarism or cranial nerve palsies can occur after GKS. Patients with Nelson's syndrome require continued multidisciplinary follow-up care. Given the difficulties associated with management of Nelson's syndrome, even the modest results of GKS may be helpful for a number of patients.",Excluded

Result(s): BD patients had lower FA within seven WM regions, including clusters in bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and left anterior thalamic radiation, and exhibited mildly slower processing speed. Among BD patients, lower FA values within left inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with slower processing speed. There were no significant associations among HC subjects or for switching performance in either group. Conclusion(s): Consistent with the literature, BD patients demonstrated abnormal WM integrity, primarily in the longitudinal fasciculus, and this deficit was most pronounced among BD patients with the slowest processing speed. These findings suggest that BD processing speed deficits may be due to abnormal WM integrity in the longitudinal fasciculus.",Excluded
3383,"Urethral pain among prostate cancer survivors 1 to 14 years after radiation therapy PURPOSE: To investigate how treatment-related and non-treatment-related factors impact urethral pain among long-term prostate cancer survivors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Men treated for prostate cancer with radiation therapy at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden from 1993 to 2006 were approached with a study-specific postal questionnaire addressing symptoms after treatment, including urethral burning pain during urination (n=985). The men had received primary or salvage external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT in combination with brachytherapy (BT). Prescribed doses were commonly 70 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions for primary and salvage EBRT and 50 Gy plus 2x10.0 Gy for EBRT+BT. Prostatic urethral doses were assessed from treatment records. We also recruited 350 non-pelvic-irradiated, population-based controls matched for age and residency to provide symptom background rates.RESULTS: Of the treated men, 16% (137 of 863) reported urethral pain, compared with 11% (27 of 242) of the controls. The median time to follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1.1-14.3 years). Prostatic urethral doses were similar to prescription doses for EBRT and 100% to 115% for BT. Fractionation-corrected dose and time to follow-up affected the occurrence of the symptom. For a follow-up>=3 years, 19% of men (52 of 268) within the 70-Gy EBRT+BT group reported pain, compared with 10% of men (23 of 222) treated with 70 Gy primary EBRT (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0). Of the men treated with salvage EBRT, 10% (20 of 197) reported urethral pain.CONCLUSIONS: Survivors treated with EBRT+BT had a higher risk for urethral pain compared with those treated with EBRT. The symptom prevalence decreased with longer time to follow-up. We found a relationship between fractionation-corrected urethral dose and pain. Among long-term prostate cancer survivors, the occurrence of pain was not increased above the background rate for prostatic urethral doses up to 70 Gy3.",Included
2705,"Multisession radiosurgery for sellar and parasellar benign meningiomas: Long-term tumor growth control and visual outcome BACKGROUND: Concern about radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) has governed recent thinking about the role of radiation therapy in the treatment of meningiomas involving the anterior optic pathways. Despite this concern, during the last few years, the use of radiosurgery for such lesions has increased steadily. OBJECTIVE(S): To define both the tumor control rate and the risk of RION over a long-term follow-up period in a large cohort of patients treated with multisession radiosurgery. METHOD(S): The local control and visual outcome of 143 patients who underwent multisession radiosurgery (mRS) were evaluated. Neurological outcome was also analyzed. The data for the present study were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. RESULT(S): The mean follow-up was 44 months (range, 12-113 months). All patients underwent mRS. The median prescription dose was 25 Gy delivered in 3 to 5 fractions. The prescription isodose, which typically encompassed at least 95% of the tumor, ranged from 65% to 86% (median, 80%). The mean tumor volume was 11.0 cm 3 (range, 0.1-126.3 cm 3; median, 8 cm 3). The progression-free survival at 3, 5, and 8 years was 100%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. Compared with baseline, visual function improved in 36% of patients, whereas 7.4% experienced a worsening in visual function (5.1% excluding the patients with progressive disease). CONCLUSION(S): Good local control rate and a low risk of RION indicate that mRS is a safe and effective treatment option in cases of large meningiomas.

2956,"Differential expression of Homer1a in the hippocampus and cortex likely plays a role in radiation-induced brain injury Fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation is the primary treatment for metastatic brain tumors. Despite reducing tumor burden and increasing lifespan, progressive, irreversible cognitive impairment occurs in >50% of the patients who survive >6 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this radiation-induced brain injury are unknown; however, preclinical studies suggest that radiation modulates the extracellular receptor kinase signaling pathway, which is associated with cognitive impairment in many neurological diseases. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the extracellular receptor kinase transcriptionally-regulated early response gene, Homer1a, was up-regulated transiently in the hippocampus and down-regulated in the cortex of young adult male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats at 48 h after 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation. Two months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation, these changes in Homer1a expression correlated with a down-regulation of the hippocampal glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma, and an up-regulation of cortical glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma. Two drugs that prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats, the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, reversed the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced Homer1a expression at 48 h in the hippocampus and cortex and restored glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma to the levels in sham-irradiated controls at 2 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. These data indicate that Homer1a is, (1) a brain region specific regulator of radiation-induced brain injury, including cognitive impairment and (2) potentially a druggable target for preventing it.",Included
3135,"[The effect of streptokinase on the development of rat cerebral cortex cells in vitro] The aim of this study was to determine the effect of streptokinase (SK) on the ultrastructure of cellular elements in the cerebral cortex of newborn rats in vitro. Three series of cell cultures grown on DMEM were used, including those grown on the medium enriched with 15% fetal calf serum (control 1), cultures transferred to the depleted medium containing only 0.5% of this serum (control 2), and the experimental cultures, to which SK (2000 IU/ml) was added. Addition of SK to the medium prevented a reduction of the viability of mature (14 days) dissociated neocortical cell culture from 1-2-day-old rats, induced by a transfer of the culture to a blood serum protein-deficient medium. In a 7-day culture SK potentiated the decrease in the cell viability. In organotypical cultures, with the use of electron microscopy, it was found that SK in concentration used prevented the development of destructive changes in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons of explants, induced by a deficit in serum proteins. The neurons contained numerous mitochondria, some of which had only a few cristae. Signs of destruction were observed only in neuronal nuclei. After exposure to SK for 48 hours an activation of oligodendrocytes (containing numerous myelin bodies) was noted which was accompanied by astrocyte disintegration (with hyperchromatic nuclei in the remaining cells).

Cells exposed to a priming dose of X-rays and then exposed immediately to a series of neutron doses regard the X-ray dose as equivalent to a neutron dose giving the same surviving fraction (iso-effective). If the cells are exposed to a neutron dose followed by X-rays the resulting survival is higher than would be obtained if the primary dose had been an iso-effective X-ray dose. However, it is lower than would be expected if the two radiations acted independently. The results imply that there is interaction between the damage caused by X-rays and fast neurons.

2643,"Long-term kindling of the basolateral amygdala impairs copulatory behavior in male rats This experiment examined the consequences of long-term kindling of the basolateral amygdala on male sexual behavior and the frequency of both spontaneous wet dog shakes (WDS) and those induced by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI. Results demonstrated that following 60 stimulations of the left basolateral amygdala over a 4-week period, male Long-Evans rats exhibited decrements in every aspect of sexual behavior. Specifically, latencies to mount, intromit and ejaculate were all prolonged following long-term kindling, and ejaculation frequencies were significantly reduced. Furthermore, spontaneous peri-copulatory WDS were increased in kindled rats, suggesting a possible role of the 5-HT2A receptor. However, countering this suggestion, there were no differences between sham and kindled rats on WDS induced by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI. These results suggest that kindled rats may exhibit elevated levels of endogenous serotonin during exposure to a female rat, which would attenuate copulatory behavior, while concurrently increasing WDS expression.",Excluded

After 10-min occlusion of both common carotid arteries, the gerbils were placed in the vicinity of an electromagnet and continuously exposed to ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) for 7 days. Their behaviour (locomotion, stereotypy, rotations, and immobility) was monitored on days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 after reperfusion for 60min in the open field. It was shown that the 10-min global cerebral ischemia per se induced a significant motor activity increase (locomotion, stereotypy and rotations), and consequently immobility decrease until day 4 after reperfusion, compared to control gerbils. Exposure to ELF-MF inhibited development of ischemia-induced motor hyperactivity during the whole period of registration, but significantly in the first 2 days after reperfusion, when the postischemic hyperactivity was most evident. Motor activity of these gerbils was still significantly increased compared to control ones, but only on day 1 after reperfusion. Our results revealed that the applied ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) decreased motor hyperactivity induced by the 10-min global cerebral ischemia, via modulation of the processes that underlie this behavioural response.",Excluded
2818,"Sex-dependent differences in the activity and modulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors in rat dorsal root ganglia neurons Women have greater temporal summation of experimental pain stimuli and also have a higher propensity for developing chronic visceral pain conditions. Sex hormone-mediated regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) in nociceptive pathways is a plausible mechanism that may underlie these phenomena. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) in modulation of NMDAR activity in adult male and female rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons were collected from adult male or female rats and grown in short-term culture in steroid-free media. NMDAR currents were recorded on small to medium size neurons by whole cell patch clamp using rapid perfusion with saturating concentrations of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid and glycine in the absence of extracellular Mg(2+). We found that the average density of NMDAR currents was 2.8-fold larger in DRG neurons from female rats compared with male rats (P<0.0001). Addition of 100 nM E2 increased NMDAR currents 55+/-15% in female neurons, but only 19+/-7% in male neurons. Potentiation was maximal after 20-40 min and dose dependent with an apparent 50% excitatory concentration of 17-23 nM. This effect was mimicked by E2 conjugated to BSA and attenuated by pretreatment with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A (1 microM) or the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI 182,780 (1 microM), strongly suggesting activation of a cell surface ER acting through a non-genomic mechanism involving protein tyrosine kinases to increase NMDAR currents.

NMDAR-independent LTP in the CA1 region is thought to require activity of postsynaptic L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (Cav1.x), but the underlying channel isoform remains unknown. We evaluated the function of the Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel for spatial learning, synaptic plasticity, and triggering of learning-associated biochemical processes using a mouse line with an inactivation of the CACNA1C (Cav1.2) gene in the hippocampus and neocortex (Cav1.2(HCKO)). This model shows (1) a selective loss of protein synthesis-dependent NMDAR-independent Schaffer collateral/CA1 late-phase LTP (L-LTP), (2) a severe impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, and (3) decreased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and reduced cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent transcription in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our results provide strong evidence for a role of L-type Ca2+ channel-dependent, NMDAR-independent hippocampal L-LTP in the formation of spatial memory in the behaving animal and for a function of the MAPK/CREB (CRE-binding protein) signaling cascade in linking Cav1.2 channel-mediated Ca2+ influx to either process.",Excluded
2867,"Early neural grafts transiently reduce the behavioral effects of radiation-induced fascia dentata granule cell hypoplasia X-irradiation of the neonatal rat hippocampus produces a selective hypoplasia of fascia dentata granule cells, locomotor hyperactivity, perseverative movements and deficits in passive avoidance. We previously reported that transplantation of fetal hippocampal tissue into the adult (age = 182 +/- 4 days) brain produced a partial recovery of these behavioral deficits. Since graft/host interconnections are more prominent when transplants are conducted soon after radiation-induced hippocampal damage, in this study we transplanted hippocampal or cerebral cortex neurons when host rats were 33 +/- 5 days of age (i.e. only 16 days after radiogenic brain damage). Behavioral evaluations were conducted 80 and 182 days after transplantation or surgical control procedures. In the first test series only, selective components of locomotion (e.g. stereotypy and total distance traveled) and perseverative turning (e.g. mean bout length and turning speed topography) were normalized by the hippocampal grafts. Radiation-induced changes in passive avoidance were less prominent in these studies than in past experiments. Still, transplantation of hippocampal tissue improved performance on this learning task as well. Cerebral cortex grafts did not produce reliable improvements in most behavioral measures. These data suggest that hippocampal grafts placed soon after X-ray induced fascia dentata hypoplasia reduce a broad range of behavioral deficits. However, these benefits are transient and, for the most part, depend on the use of transplant tissues homologous with those damaged.",Excluded

The incidence of radiation-induced complications, especially radiation optic neuropathy (RON), increases along with prolonging survival time of the patients. This study was to investigate RON in NPC patients after irradiation by visual field and visual evoked potential (VEP) tests. METHOD(S): A total of 28 NPC patients, who underwent conventional external-beam irradiation, received visual field and VEP tests before irradiation, at the end of irradiation, and 5 years after irradiation. RESULT(S): Thirty-four (60.7%) eyes in 21 patients developed pathological visual field; 15 (44.1%) of these 34 eyes occurred within 10-24 months after irradiation. Of the 34 eyes, 8 showed concentric visual field constriction; 6 showed bitemporal hemianopia; 8 showed local photosensitivity descend; 10 showed central or cecocentral scotoma; 2 showed scotoma enlargement. Forty-four (78.6%) eyes in 26 patients appeared VEP abnormity; 24 (54.5%) of these 44 eyes occurred within 14 months after irradiation. In small, medium, and large elements, VEP latencies were significantly longer within 1 year after irradiation than pre-irradiation (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P=0.001); VEP amplitudes were lower within 1 year after irradiation than pre-irradiation without significant difference (P=0.249, P=0.940, and P=0.450). One year after treatment, VEP latency delay maintained in each element (P=0.004, P < 0.001, P < 0.001); VEP amplitudes were decreased (P=0.002, P=0.189, P < 0.001). The incidence of pathologic visual field was significantly lower in patients received irradiation of < or =70 Gy than in patients received irradiation of > 70 Gy (50.0% vs. 77.3%, P=0.041).

The visual disturbances may be due to a combination of intracerebral pressure changes and exposure to ionizing radiation. The retina and the retinal vasculature play important roles in vision, yet have not been studied extensively in relationship to space travel and space radiation. The goal of the current study was to characterize oxidative damage and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells after whole-body gamma-ray, proton and oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O) ion radiation exposure at 0.1 to 1 Gy. Six-month-old male C57Bl/6J mice were whole-body irradiated with 600 MeV/n <sup>16</sup>O ions (0, 0.1, 0.25, 1 Gy), solar particle event (SPE)-like protons (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy) or <sup>60</sup>Co gamma rays (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy).

Medical treatment, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are dependent on the histological type and provide clinical relief for a short duration with high recurrence rate. Revascularization by EVT comprising angioplasty and stent placement is the first-line treatment. Clinical Findings/Procedure: Pictorial review of 200 treated patients. Orthopnea and edema of the upper body are the main symptoms but respiratory distress, convulsions, or coma due to cerebral edema are also described. Main causes are tumor invasion (60%-97%) with bronchopulmonary cancers being the most common (60%-90%) followed by lymphomas (6%-25%) and metastases. The tumor may be treated with radiation or chemotherapy, with efficacy rates up to 94% and 77%, respectively, but this varies with histologic types. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and femoral venous access alone is used when possible. Brachial or jugular approaches can be used if dual venous access is required. From our experience, self-expandable stents outperform balloonexpandable stents and thrombolysis may be used before or after stent placement in cases of severe obstruction or stent thrombosis. Relief of symptoms after stenting is usually complete or partial and recurrences may be treated by reintervention. Conclusion(s): EVT for malignancy-related SVCS has a satisfactory level of clinical success with relatively low morbidity and mortality in the context of neoplasm.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into such filamentous inclusions remain unknown, although many factors have been implicated, including interactions with lipid membranes. To model the effects of membrane fields on alpha-synuclein, we analyzed the structural and fibrillation properties of this protein in mixtures of water with simple and fluorinated alcohols. All solvents that were studied induced folding of alpha-synuclein, with the common first stage being formation of a partially folded intermediate with an enhanced propensity to fibrillate. Protein fibrillation was completely inhibited due to formation of beta-structure-enriched oligomers with high concentrations of methanol, ethanol, and propanol and moderate concentrations of trifluoroethanol (TFE), or because of the appearance of a highly alpha-helical conformation at high TFE and hexafluoro-2-propanol concentrations.

Studies have been developed to obtain effective treatments in controlling the secondary injury that occurs after spinal cord injury, which substantially changes the prognosis. Low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) has been applied in neuroscience due to its anti-inflammatory effects on biological tissue in the repairing process. Few studies have been made associating LILT to the spinal cord injury. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the LILT (GaAlAs laser-780 nm) on the locomotor functional recovery, histomorphometric, and histopathological changes of the spinal cord after moderate traumatic injury in rats (spinal cord injury at T9 and T10). Thirty-one adult Wistar rats were used, which were divided into seven groups: control without surgery (n = 3), control surgery (n = 3), laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5), medullar lesion (n = 5) without phototherapy, medullar lesion + laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), and medullar lesion + laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5). The assessment of the motor function was performed using Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and adapted Sciatic Functional Index (aSFI). The assessment of urinary dysfunction was clinically performed. After 21 days postoperative, the animals were euthanized for histological and histomorphometric analysis of the spinal cord. The results showed faster motor evolution in rats with spinal contusion treated with LILT, maintenance of the effectiveness of the urinary system, and preservation of nerve tissue in the lesion area, with a notorious inflammation control and increased number of nerve cells and connections.

Hepatotoxicity is a concern in NET patients receiving TARE, due to longer survival and exposure to additional radioactive therapies. The body surface area (BSA) method for prescribing <sup>90</sup>Y resin microspheres may under- or overestimate the ideal administered activity, resulting in radiation doses that may undertreat tumors or over-expose normal liver. The purpose of this study was to compare voxel-based dosimetry of healthy liver dose based on <sup>99m</sup>Tc-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) and <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): From a larger consecutive series of 127 patients, a retrospective review was performed for 26 patients who underwent 34 <sup>90</sup>Y-microsphere treatments (SIR-Spheres, Sirtex Medical) from March 2016 to March 2019. For each treatment, the liver and tumors were segmented manually using MIM v7 SurePlan (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, Ohio) using the CT portion of the <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT study. Voxel-based dosimetry was performed using pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA imaging for predicting dose from treatment and <sup>90</sup>Y-Bremsstrahlung imaging to estimate final therapeutic dose. Dose calculations were performed assuming local deposition within the MIM SurePlan dosimetry platform. Result(s): A total of 390 tumors were segmented across 34 treatments. Tumor count per patient ranged from 1 to 32 (9.7 +/- 9.6). Tumor liver burden ranged from 1.2% to 66% (mean, 16.1%; median, 6.1%.) Whole liver volumes ranged from 1139 mL to 4780 mL (2124 +/- 867 mL). Healthy liver volumes ranged from 1011 mL to 2763 mL (1671 +/- 472 mL).

A strong correlation was observed when comparing healthy liver absorbed dose measured by post-treatment imaging with what was predicted from pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA mapping (slope = 0.87 +/- 0.05; intercept = 3.0 +/- 1.5 Gy; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.924). This is in contrast with the observed relationship between BSA-derived administered activity and healthy liver volume (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.081). Conclusion(s): Voxel-based dose estimates to healthy liver based on pre-treatment <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA imaging strongly correlate to dose measurements from post-treatment imaging. This application may be useful for optimizing dose delivery in TARE, particularly in NET patients, given their greater risk for long-term hepatotoxicity. Copyright © 2021",Excluded
3212,"A review of astronaut mental health in manned missions: Potential interventions for cognitive and mental health challenges Space is an isolated, confined environment for humans. These conditions can have numerous effects on astronaut mental health and safety. Psychological and social issues affect space crew due to the isolation, confinement, and prolonged separation from family and friends. This area of research is particularly crucial given the space sector's plans for Martian colonies and space tourism, as well as to aid astronauts when under high stress. Therefore, this paper reviews the effects of isolation/confinement on psychological and cognitive health; impact of radiation and microgravity on cognitive health; and implications of disturbances to the circadian rhythm and sleep in space. Possible solutions to relevant mentioned cognitive and mental health challenges are also discussed.",Excluded

3144,"Regeneration of dopaminergic neurons after 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion in planarian brain Planarians have robust regenerative ability dependent on X-ray-sensitive pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts. Here, we report that planarians can regenerate dopaminergic neurons after selective degeneration of these neurons caused by treatment with a dopaminergic neurotoxin (6-hydroxydopamine; 6-OHDA). This suggests that planarians have a system to sense the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and to recruit stem cells to produce dopaminergic neurons to recover brain morphology and function. We confirmed that X-ray-irradiated planarians do not regenerate brain dopaminergic neurons after 6-OHDA-induced lesioning, suggesting that newly generated dopaminergic neurons are indeed derived from pluripotent stem cells. However, we found that the majority of regenerated dopaminergic neurons were 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-negative cells. Therefore, we carefully analyzed when proliferating stem cells became committed to become dopaminergic neurons during regeneration by a combination of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments, immunostaining/in situ hybridization, and 5-fluorouracil treatment. The results strongly suggested that G(2) -phase stem cells become committed to dopaminergic neurons in the mesenchymal space around the brain, after migration from the trunk region following S-phase. These new findings obtained from planarian regeneration provide hints about how to conduct cell-transplantation therapy for future regenerative medicine.",Excluded

We investigated multiple pretreatment PET metrics, including SUV<inf>max</inf>, mean SUV (SUV<inf>mean</inf>), total lesion glycolysis, and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in LS-SCLC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and correlated them with survival and disease control outcomes. Patients and Methods All patients received platinum-based chemotherapy and a median radiation dose of 45 Gy. Kaplan-Meier and competing-risks analyses were performed to assess the prognostic value of PET metrics with respect to overall survival (OS), distant failure (DF), disease-free survival (DFS), and locoregional failure (LRF). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to account for the effect of other clinical factors on outcomes. Results A total of 120 patients with LS-SCLC had analyzable pre-CRT PET/CTs. The median follow up was 34 months. Median OS was 26.9 months. OS was 53.2% at 2 years and 33.1% at 5 years. SUV<inf>max</inf>, SUV<inf>mean</inf>, MTV, and total lesion glycolysis of the primary tumor were not significantly associated with OS, LRF, and DFS on univariate analysis. MTV was significantly associated with DF (P =.024) on univariate but not multivariate analysis. Conclusion This is the largest reported series to date evaluating the prognostic value of baseline PET metrics in LS-SCLC. Neither SUV<inf>max</inf> nor other analyzed PET metrics demonstrated significant correlation with OS or LRF. MTV was correlated with DF and DFS, but this association was no longer significant after adjustment for other clinical factors. This analysis suggests that pretreatment PET scans, even with the use of advanced metrics, do not have independent prognostic value for outcomes in LS-SCLC patients after CRT.

2529,"Efficacy of simultaneous pericranial and nasoseptal ""double flap"" reconstruction of anterior skull base defects after combined transbasal and endoscopic endonasal approaches Background: The vascularized pedicled pericranial flap (PCF) has been the traditional method of reconstruction of skull base defects after craniofacial resection of malignant anterior skull base (ASB) lesions. However, flap necrosis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks can occur after radiation therapy. The ""double flap"" reconstruction technique was developed to augment the PCF inferiorly by a secondary vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF) that is harvested using an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA), when a combined cranionasal (transbasal EEA) approach is performed. This study examines the rates of postoperative CSF leaks and flap necrosis after a combined PCF and NSF closure of the skull base defect. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective review on nine consecutive patients, who underwent the double flap reconstruction technique after a combined transbasal-EEA approach. Data collected for each patient included demographics, method of tumor resection and repair, complications, tumor recurrence, and follow-up. Result(s): Nine patients who underwent a combined transbasal and (EEA) for resection of anterior skull base tumors with significant intracranial extension followed by reconstruction of the cranial base using the double flap were identified. Four were men and five were women, with a mean age of 49 years (range: 15-68 years). There was no postoperative CSF leakage detected or complications of infection, meningitis, mucocele or tension pneumocephalus after a mean follow-up of 15.1 months (range: 4.6-35.4 months). Eight of the nine patients underwent adjuvant radiation without flap necrosis. Tumor recurrence was not observed in any of the patients at last follow-up. Conclusion(s): The simultaneous PCF and NSF double flap reconstruction is an effective technique in preventing postoperative CSF leakage and postradiation necrosis when repairing anterior skull base defects after combined transbasal-EEA approaches.",Excluded
3045,"The white 'matter' in obsessive compulsive disorder: Effect of pharmacological treatment and symptom dimensions models Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is highly heterogeneous in its manifestations, both across patients and within the same patient over time. The disorder is probably best described by a multidimensional model involving several symptom dimensions, whose precise number and phenotypes are debated. This heterogeneity partly explains, beyond methodological discrepancies, the inconsistency of results in current brain imaging research in the disorder, particularly in diffusion tensor imaging studies. Purpose(s): We aimed at investigating white matter (WM) alterations associated with OCD, controlling for the impact of variables known to affect WM structure, and specifically for the effect of current and lifetime pharmacological treatment. Then, we tested two different symptom dimensions models [1,2] within OCD patients, analysing theirWMcorrelates, for both prevailing current symptom dimension and symptom dimension at onset. Method(s): We compared 58 adult pure-OCD patients and 58 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC), with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics on diffusion tensor images, using TFCE correction (p = 0.05). With respect to symptom dimensions, separate analyses were carried on the sole OCD sample. The diffusion measures Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity (AD), Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) were used as parameters of WM organisation. Result(s): The observed differences between OCD patients and HC were totally carried by the effect of previous and current medications. No differences were in fact observed between drugna ive patients and HC. Current medication was associated with a widespread decrease of FA and increase of RD throughout the whole brain. Lifetime treatment was associated with a decrease in FA in the tracts surrounding the thalami, site of major neurotransmitter alteration in OCD. In the analysis of symptom dimensions, only a finer-grained five-factors model [2] allowed for the identification of specific neural correlates. Patients having current Symmetry/Perfectionism dimension show a reduction in RD and MD in the body of corpus callosum and in left higher-order visual association tracts, including: left uncinate fasciculus, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and/or inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. Furthermore, patients having Doubt/Checking dimension at onset show a widespread reduction of AD, encompassing corpus callosum, and bilaterally the thalamic radiations, internal capsule, cingulum, corona radiata and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Finally, patients having Rituals/Superstition dimension at onset show an increase in FA in the cortico-striato-thalamic circuits: genu of corpus callosum, bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, bilateral anterior thalamic radiations and left external capsule. Conclusion(s): Present results confirm the effect of medications on WM in OCD [3], showing a large effect of current treatment on myelination and a site-specific, disorder-specific, effect of medications on brain systems. Furthermore, our findings provide support to a multidimensional model of OCD, and indicate that the distinction of clinically homogeneous dimensions is essential for the identification of reliable neural correlates. Finally, we evidence, to our knowledge for the first time, that onset symptom dimensions are associated with enduring alterations of WM structure. Onset symptom dimensions may reflect underlying endophenotypes, and our results suggest their relevance for future investigations on OCD neuroanatomy and aetiopathology.",Excluded
3319,"Comparing radiation therapy and ipilimumab to ipilimumab alone in metastatic melanoma patients Purpose/Objective: With evidence suggesting ipilimumab and intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) improves survival compared to SRS alone, we compared toxicity, response rates (RRs), and outcomes of metastatic melanoma patients receiving radiation (RT) and ipilimumab to ipilimumab alone. Methods and Materials: We reviewed records of metastatic melanoma patients receiving ipilimumab 3mg/kg between 2010-2014. RRs, measured by immune RECIST criteria, and toxicity were compared by Fischer's exact text. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method. Result(s): 61 patients received ipilimumab, with 35 (57.4%) also receiving radiation within 4 months of ipilimumab. The radiation cohort was similar at baseline except for greater systemic burden of disease (82.9% vs. 42.3%, p = 0.005), higher dexamethasone use (14.3% vs. 0%, p = 0.048), and more brain involvement (74.3% vs. 0% p<0.001). 92.3% of brain metastases received SRS. Grade 3 toxicity was not statistically different between cohorts (5.9% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.113); one grade 4 was experienced (1.6%), while no grade 5 occurred. While the ipilimumab alone group demonstrated a trend toward higher 1-year OS (49.4% vs. 73.2%, p = 0.090), the cohort did not have any patients with brain metastases; therefore, comparing only patients with extra-cranial metastases, 1-year OS was similar (76.2% vs. 73.2%, p = 0.587). RR between both cohorts was similar (20.0% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.494). Pre-ipilimumab absolute lymphocyte count greater than 1000 was the only significant predictor for increased RR in multivariable analysis (Odds Ratio: 8.56, 95% CI: 1.82-40.42; p = 0.007). Comparing 2-5 fractions of radiation to ipilimumab alone demonstrated a trend towards higher response rate (42.9% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.074). Conclusion(s): Despite poorer prognostic characteristics in the RT with ipilimumab cohort, toxicity, RR and OS were similar between the arms. Prospective studies investigating the ideal radiation fractionation to improve ipilimumab response rates are warranted. ALC < 1000 should be considered an exclusion criteria for these trials.",Excluded
3490,"Low-Dose and Limited-Volume Radiotherapy Alone for Primary Dural Marginal Zone Lymphoma: Treatment Approach and Review of Published Data Purpose: Primary dural lymphoma is a rare intracranial lymphoma that almost always has a marginal zone histologic type and immunophenotype and often remains localized and is thus potentially curable with radiotherapy (RT) alone. The unusual location and histologic type of primary dural marginal zone lymphoma (PDMZL) distinguish it from primary central nervous system lymphoma and poses treatment dilemmas of technique, volume, and dose that have not been well addressed. We set out to analyze our recent experience in treating PDMZL and reviewed the limited published data available. Methods and Materials: Between 2002 and 2006, we treated 5 patients with localized PDMZL. Of these 5 patients, 3 had unilateral and 2 had bilateral/multifocal involvement, and 3 underwent subtotal tumor resection and 2 biopsy only. Whole brain RT was given before involved-field RT (IFRT) in 4 patients and 1 received IFRT alone. The median whole brain RT, IFRT, and total RT dose was 20, 12, and 30 Gy, respectively. The planning computed tomography scan was always fused with the post-gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging scan to assist in the IFRT volume determination. We also analyzed the published data from 27 additional patients. Result(s): The median follow-up was 34 months (range, 31-52). All obtained lasting local control. One patient developed a relapse in the soft tissue of the flank and additional systemic progression but no central nervous system recurrence. At last follow-up, no significant treatment-related neurotoxicity was detected. Conclusion(s): The results of our study have demonstrated that a combination of whole brain RT/IFRT or even low-dose IFRT alone provides excellent durable local control of PDMZL. This approach is potentially curative, possibly without significant neurotoxicity. Additional study and longer follow-up are needed to determine the appropriate RT dose and volume parameters for this rare, debilitating, and yet potentially curable lymphoma. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

3152,"Radiosurgery for re-irradiation of brain metastasis: Results in 54 patients Purpose: To evaluate in terms of probabilities of local-regional control and survival, as well as of treatment-related toxicity, results of radiosurgery for brain metastasis arising in previously irradiated territory. Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and March 2000, 54 consecutive patients presenting with 97 metastases relapsing after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Median interval between the end of WBRT and radiosurgery was 9 months (range 2-70). Median age was 53 years (24-80), and median Karnofski performance status (KPS) 70 (60-100). Forty-seven patients had one radiosurgery, five had two and two had three. Median metastasis diameter and volume were 21 mm (6-59) and 1.2 cc (0.1-95.2), respectively. A Leksell stereotactic head frame (Leksell Model G, Elektra, Instrument, Tucker, GA) was applied under local anesthesia. Irradiation was delivered by a gantry mounted linear accelerator (linacs) (Saturne, General Electric). Median minimal dose delivered to the gross disease was 16.2 Gy (11.8-23), and median maximal dose 21.2 Gy (14- 42). Result(s): Median follow-up was 9 months (1-57). Five metastases recurred. One- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 91.3 and 84% and 1- and 2-year brain control rates were 65 and 57%, respectively. Six patients died of brain metastasis evolution, and three of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 31 and 28%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, KPS, RPA class, SIR score and interval between WBRT and radiosurgery were prognostic factors of overall survival and brain free-disease survival. According to multivariate analysis, RPA was an independent factor of overall survival and brain free-disease survival, and the interval between WBRT and radiosurgery longer than 14 months was associated with longer brain free-disease survival. Side effects were minimal, with only two cases of headaches and two of grade 2 alopecia. Conclusion(s): Salvage radiosurgery of metastasis recurring after whole brain irradiation is an effective and accurate treatment which could be proposed to patients with a KPS > 70 and a primary tumour controlled or indolent. We recommend that a dose not exceeding 14 Gy should be delivered to an isodose representing 70% of the maximal dose since local control observed rate was similar to that previously published in literature with upper dose and side effects were minimal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
2483,"Improvement of dexterity by single session low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralesional motor cortex in acute stroke: a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial PURPOSE: Increasing evidence suggests that the contralesional motor cortex (M1) inhibits the ipsilesional M1 in stroke patients. This inhibition could impair motor function of the affected hand. We investigated if inhibitory 1~Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the contralesional M1 improved motor performance of the affected hand in acute stroke.METHODS: A double-blind study of real versus placebo rTMS was conducted. Twelve patients early after subcortical stroke (mean: 7 days) received 1200 stimuli of real and placebo rTMS in a crossover design. The sequence of stimulations was counterbalanced across subjects. Stimulus intensity was subthreshold (90% of motor threshold at rest). Motor function was tested by grip strength recordings and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) executions before and after each rTMS session.RESULTS: Compared to sham stimulation, real rTMS improved NHPT results but not grip strength in the affected hand. No change of performance was observed for the unaffected hand. NHPT baseline repetitions in a subgroup of patients indicated stable motor performance prior to the rTMS sessions.CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that therapeutic rTMS applications over the contralesional hemisphere are feasible in acute stroke patients and can transiently improve dexterity of the affected hand. RTMS may become an additional tool for early neurorehabilitation.",Excluded

3361,"Role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSCs radiation response; regeneration or senescence? Purpose or Objective Secretory function restoration is a challenge for regenerative therapy of radiation-damaged salivary glands. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed to allow such a functional regeneration. It has been suggested that glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes survival of mice salivary gland stem cells (mSGSCs). GDNF-treatment in combination with stem cell based regenerative therapy could represent a promising treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and consequential xerostomia. However, the role of GDNF on SGSC survival and proliferation after therapeutic irradiation is still an enigma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSC response to irradiation. Material and Methods Salivary gland organoid derived cells of Gdnf hypermorphic (Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup>) and wild-type mice (Gdnfwt/wt) were irradiated (IR) with gamma-rays at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy. mSGSC survival and stemness were assessed by calculating stem cell surviving fraction measured as post- IR organoid forming potential and population doublings. Flow cytometry was used to determine the CD24<sup>hi</sup>/CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell (SC) population. qPCR and immunofluorescence were used to detect GDNF expression. Six-day-old salivary gland organoids were irradiated with 7 Gy of yrays, IR induced organoids senescence were confirmed by SA-s-Gal and P16 staining. Results Exogenously added GDNF or increase expression of GDNF in hypermorphic mice SGSC induced an increase in secondary organoids formation efficiency when compared to wild-type mice/untreated SG (p<0.05). However, neither endogenous nor exogenous GDNF increased the CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell-like population. Organoids IR surviving fraction (OSF) of mSGSCs were similar albeit resulted in larger spheres and an increased cell number in the Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> compared to Gdnfwt/wt group. Indeed, mSGSC of Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> mice showed high sphere forming efficiency upon replating. Cell cycle distribution of SGSC after irradiation had no difference with or without GDNF. Interestingly, GDNF expression was highly upregulated after irradiation both in vitro (p=0.008) and in vivo (p<0.05) but normalized in vivo after mSGSC transplantation-related regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) expression was strongly related to OSF (r=0.842, p=0.002) and co-localized with GDNF in salivary gland striated ducts. More than 90% IR induced senescence located in striated ducts where GDNF colocalized with senescence marker p16 and SA-s-Gal. Interestingly, senescence cells were detected in organoids after IR. Conclusion GDNF does not protect mSGSCs against irradiation but seems to promote mSGSCs proliferation through the GDNF-RET signaling pathway. Post-transplantation stimulation of GDNF/RET pathway may enhance the regenerative potential of mSGSCs. IR induced upregulation of GDNF may be involved in IR induced senescence.",Included
3146,"Brachytherapy of cancer. [Japanese] Brachytherapy is one of most effective methods of radiotherapy for cancer, and therefore, low-dose-rate brachytherapy is widely used for carcinoma of the uterus and carcinoma of the tongue. Between 1974 and 1983, 76 primary thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinomas were treated with external irradiation combined with additional intracavitary radium therapy at the National Sapporo Hospital. The esophageal primary control rate was 34% and the 5-year survival rate was 24.1%. We believe that external irradiation therapy followed by additional intracavitary radium irradiation produces good results. Also, from 1982, 30 patients with small residual or unresectable tumors received interstitial irradiation using an after-loading technique and iridium-192 seeds. Eighteen of these 30 patients treated with iridium-192 were recurrent cases, and 20 had outer tubes intra-operatively inserted into the tumor following iridium-192 irradiation. Ten of these patients had brain tumor, nine had cancer of the head and neck, and each of the remaining fifteen had the following malignancies: lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer, uterus cancer, skin cancer and soft tissue sarcoma.

In the present study, our goals were to detect the functional and morphological changes that result in the administration of l-alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC), a deacylated derivative of phosphatidylcholine, in a rodent model of hippocampus irradiation. Anaesthetized SPRD rats were subjected to 40-Gy irradiation of one hemisphere of the brain, with or without GPC treatment (50 mg/kg per os). After the irradiation the rats received GPC or the vehicle at the same time every second day at 5 days per week. The effects of partial rat brain irradiation on the spatial orientation and learning ability of rats were assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, which was performed once before and two times after the irradiation. At the same time morphological changes were detected by MRI to define the time-point for histological examinations. Irradiation of 40-Gy resulted in moderate neurological deficit both at the level of cognitive function and morphology after 4 weeks of irradiation. The MWM test was found to be a highly sensitive tool for the detection of neurofunctional impairment. We found that the place navigational function of the ratswas impaired by the irradiation and the treatment with GPC could prevent this damage. Marked protective effect of the GPC was detected as concerns of the histopathological findings. Targeted brain irradiation induced notable changes in the central nervous system. GPC supplementation provides significant protection against irradiation-caused functional and morphological disturbances.",Included

The amygdala, which develops during the early embryonic stage and is critical for emotion processing, might be particularly sensitive.METHODS: Using data from a neuroimaging follow-up of the ELSPAC prenatal birth cohort (n=129, 47% men, 23-24 years old), we studied the impact of prenatal stress during the first and second half of pregnancy on the volume of the amygdala and its nuclei in young adult offspring. We further evaluated the relationship between amygdala anatomy and offspring depressive symptomatology. Amygdala nuclei were parcellated using FreeSurfer's automated segmentation pipeline. Depressive symptoms were measured via self-report using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).RESULTS: Exposure to stress during the first half of pregnancy was associated with smaller accessory basal (Cohen's f<sup>2</sup>=0.27, p(FDR)=0.03) and cortical (Cohen's f<sup>2</sup>=0.29, p(FDR)=0.03) nuclei volumes. This effect remained significant after correcting for sex, stress during the second half of pregnancy, as well as maternal age at birth, birth weight, maternal education, and offspring's age at MRI. These two nuclei showed a quadratic relationship with BDI scores in young adulthood, where both smaller and larger volume was associated with more depressive symptoms (Accessory basal nucleus: Adj R<sup>2</sup>=0.05. p(FDR)=0.015; Cortical nucleus: Adj R<sup>2</sup>=0.04, p(FDR)=0.015).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that exposure to stress during the first half of pregnancy might have long-term implications for amygdala anatomy, which may in turn predict the experience of depressive symptoms in young adulthood.",Excluded
3546,"Cranial CT with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction: Improved image quality with concomitant radiation dose reduction BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To safeguard patient health, there is great interest in CT radiation-dose reduction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an iterative-reconstruction algorithm, ASIR, on image-quality measures in reduced-dose head CT scans for adult patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a 64-section scanner, we analyzed 100 reduced-dose adult head CT scans at 6 predefined levels of ASIR blended with FBP reconstruction. These scans were compared with 50 CT scans previously obtained at a higher routine dose without ASIR reconstruction. SNR and CNR were computed from Hounsfield unit measurements of normal GM and WM of brain parenchyma. A blinded qualitative analysis was performed in 10 lower-dose CT datasets compared with higher-dose ones without ASIR. Phantom data analysis was also performed. RESULT(S): Lower-dose scans without ASIR had significantly lower mean GM and WM SNR (P = .003) and similar GM-WM CNR values compared with higher routine-dose scans. However, at ASIR levels of 20%-40%, there was no statistically significant difference in SNR, and at ASIR levels of >=60%, the SNR values of the reduced-dose scans were significantly higher (P < .01). CNR values were also significantly higher at ASIR levels of >=40% (P < .01). Blinded qualitative review demonstrated significant improvements in perceived image noise, artifacts, and GM-WM differentiation at ASIR levels >=60% (P < .01). CONCLUSION(S): These results demonstrate that the use of ASIR in adult head CT scans reduces image noise and increases low-contrast resolution, while allowing lower radiation doses without affecting spatial resolution.",Excluded

2830,"Whole-brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery in brain metastases: what is the evidence? The overall local treatment paradigm of brain metastases, which includes whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), continues to evolve. Local therapies play an important role in the management of brain metastases. The choice of local therapy depends on factors that involve the patient (performance status, expected survival, and age), the prior treatment history, and the tumor (type and subtype, number, size, location of metastases, and extracranial disease status). Multidisciplinary collaboration is required to facilitate an individualized plan to improve the outcome of disease in patients with this life-limiting complication. There has been concern about the neurocognitive effects of WBRT. A number of approaches that mitigate cognitive dysfunction, such as pharmacologic intervention (memantine) or a hippocampal-sparing strategy, have been studied in a prospective manner with WBRT. Although there has been an increase in the use of SRS in the management of brain metastases in recent years, WBRT retains an important therapeutic role.",Excluded

Conventional MRI is widely used to assess disease status, but cannot reliably distinguish between tumor progression and treatment-related effects. Several advanced imaging techniques are promising, but have yet to be prospectively validated for this use. This review explores two treatment-related effects, pseudoprogression and radiation necrosis, as well as the concept of pseudoresponse, and highlights several advanced imaging modalities and the evidence supporting their use in differentiating tumor progression from treatment-related effect.",Excluded
2897,"Ophthalmologic aspects of treating optic neuropathy during the course of Graves-Basedow disease. [Polish] The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of conservative treatment of optic neuropathy in the course of Graves' disease. Nineteen patients with neuropathy out of 520 patients with Graves' disease, including 15 women and 4 men were treated. Age of the patients ranged from 36 to 69 years, mean age was 51.3. In all patients thyroid function was normalized, 4 patients underwent strumectomy. Bi- and unilateral neuropathy was found in 13 and 6 cases respectively. The therapy consisted of high-dose steroids (Prednisone in 12 cases or Dexamethasone i.v. in 3 cases) or they were combined with gamma cobalt-60 irradiation of orbit tissues (2000 c Gy in 10 fractions) in 8 cases. In 2 cases radiotherapy alone was performed. Two cases were excluded from treatment because of optic atrophy during the first examination. In all patients full ophthalmological investigation, ultrasonography and computed tomography of the orbit before and after the treatment were performed. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 46 months, mean 21.4. Improvement of visual acuity and perimetry (p < 0.05) after the treatment was observed and changes of the fundus after the treatment were significantly (p = 0.000) improved. Exophthalmos significantly decreased (p < 0.05) but only in the right eye. In all patients the therapy reduced the ophthalmopathy index from mean 7.5 to 4.1 (p = 0.000). In conclusion: 1. Early diagnosis and appropriate, constant conservative treatment of optic neuropathy in Graves' disease prevent from blindness and surgical intervention. 2. Corticotherapy in combination with radiotherapy of the orbit is a beneficial method of the treatment of optic neuropathy in Graves' disease.",Excluded

2827,"Deterministic multiplicative gain control with active dendrites Multiplicative gain control is a vital component of many theoretical analyses of neural computations, conferring the ability to scale neuronal firing rate in response to synaptic inputs. Many theories of gain control in single cells have used precisely balanced noisy inputs. Such noisy inputs can degrade signal processing. We demonstrate a deterministic method for the control of gain without the use of noise. We show that a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP), arising from active dendritic spike backpropagation, leads to a multiplicative increase in gain. Reduction of DAP amplitude by dendritic inhibition dilutes the multiplicative effect, allowing for divisive scaling of the firing rate. In contrast, somatic inhibition acts in a subtractive manner, allowing spatially distinct inhibitory inputs to perform distinct computations. The simplicity of this mechanism and the ubiquity of its elementary components suggest that many cell types have the potential to display a dendritic division of neuronal output.",Excluded
2585,"Lipid peroxidation of liposomes with different ratios of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. [Chinese] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different ratios of phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol (PC/CHOL) in liposomes on lipid peroxidation. The liposomes were prepared by ultrasonication using egg yolk lecithin alone (PC, control) or with different contents of cholesterol in molar ratios of 1:0.125, 1:0.25, and 1:0.5. Conjugated dienes (CD), FOX (ferrous oxidation/xylenol orange), and TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) were determined and used as indices of lipid peroxidation after incubation at 37degreeC in the presence of CuSO<inf>4</inf> over 24 h. Lipid peroxidation of the liposomes increased with increasing incubation time, irrespective of whether or not they contained cholesterol. In addition, results from the CD and FOX assays markedly increased after 2 h of incubation, while TBARS increased after 4 h of incubation. In the initial 8-h incubation, CD, FOX, and TBARS in PC/CHOL (1: 0.5) gradually decreased with increasing cholesterol contents of liposomes but were significantly higher after 24 h of incubation when compared to the control group. However, the cholesterol content of liposomes did not affect the fatty acid composition after 24 h of incubation. The results suggest that cholesterol in liposomes affects lipid peroxidation, and the oxidation status may be dependent upon incubation time.",Excluded
3438,A comparison between the distinct inward currents activated in rat cultured dorsal root ganglion neurones by intracellular flash photolysis of two forms of caged cyclic guanosine monophosphate Whole cell inward currents activated by intracellular photorelease of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were investigated in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones. The actions of two distinct types of caged cGMP (NPE-caged cGMP and a highly water-soluble caged cGMP) were compared. Rapidly activating inward currents were evoked by cGMP in a subpopulation (12.5%) of neurones and these currents may be due to activity of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. In contrast in 52% of DRG neurones intracellular photorelease of cGMP activated a delayed Ca(2+)-dependent inward current through the generation of cyclic ADPribose and mobilisation of Ca(2+) from ryanodine sensitive intracellular stores. Similar delayed inward currents were activated by both caged compounds but only NPE-caged cGMP evoked rapidly activating currents. Cyclic GMP appears to increase excitability in some DRG neurones by diverse mechanisms.,Excluded

Calculation of rCBF was performed using the 2-weighted integral (WI) and autoradiographic methods for the 1-compartment analysis, and the 3-WI method was followed for the 2-compartment analysis. Arterial blood radioactivity was counted continuously and corrected for delay and dispersion. The rCBF images were transformed into the Talairach space and analyzed by statistical parametric mapping to identify regional differences in the 2 methods. The values obtained from regions of interest also were compared.RESULTS: Although the difference in global CBF between the 2 models was not significant, rCBF values in the large arteries and neighbor areas were significantly greater in the 2-WI method than in the 3-WI method. However, regional differences in the activation studies were not affected when the 2 methods were compared. The images of cerebral arterial blood volume (V(0)) obtained by the 3-WI method showed a significant increase in V(0) in the visual cortex during visual stimulation.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the rCBF values in the 1-compartment analysis were affected by radioactivity in the vessels. The 3-WI method could provide rCBF values that are less influenced by vascular radioactivity and also show differences in V(0) in PET activation studies.",Excluded

Five healthy volunteers underwent whole-body combined PET-computed tomography 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 hours after tracer injection (mean dose, 9.5 mCi +/- 3.4 [standard deviation] [351.5 MBq +/- 125.8]; mean specific radioactivity, 1200 mCi/mmol +/- 714 [44.4 GBq/mmol +/- 26.4]). During this time, standard vital signs, electrocardiographic (ECG) readings, and blood sample values (for chemistry, hematologic, and liver function tests) were checked at regular intervals and 1 and 7 days after the injection. These data were used to evaluate tracer biodistribution and dosimetric properties, time-activity curves, and the stability of laboratory values. Significant changes in vital signs and laboratory values were evaluated by using a combination of population-averaged generalized estimating equation regression and exact paired Wilcoxon tests.RESULTS: The administration of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was well tolerated, with no marked effects on vital signs, ECG readings, or laboratory values. The tracer showed the same pattern of biodistribution in all volunteers: primary clearance through the kidneys (0.360 rem/mCi +/- 0.185 [0.098 mSv/MBq +/- 0.050]) and bladder (0.862 rem/mCi +/- 0.436 [0.233 mSv/MBq +/- 0.118], voiding model) and uptake in the spleen (0.250 rem/mCi +/- 0.168 [0.068 mSv/MBq +/- 0.046]) and large intestine (0.529 rem/mCi +/- 0.236 [0.143 mSv/MBq +/- 0.064]). The mean effective dose of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was 0.1462 rem/mCi +/- 0.0669 (0.0396 mSv/MBq +/- 0.0181). With an injected dose of 10 mCi (370 MBq) and a 1-hour voiding interval, a patient would be exposed to an effective radiation dose of 1.5 rem (15 mSv). Above the diaphragm, there was minimal uptake in the brain ventricles, salivary glands, and thyroid gland. Time-activity curves showed rapid clearance from the vasculature, with a mean 26% +/- 17 of the tracer remaining in the circulation at 30 minutes and most of the activity occurring in the plasma relative to cells (mean whole blood-plasma ratio, 0.799 +/- 0.096).CONCLUSION: (18)F-FPPRGD2 has desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties. The primary application is likely to be PET evaluation of oncologic patients-especially those with brain, breast, or lung cancer. Specific indications may include tumor staging, identifying patients who would benefit from antiangiogenesis therapy, and separating treatment responders from nonresponders early.",Excluded

The goal of our project was to evaluate the dosimetric and clinical impact of 3D vs. two-dimensional (2D) planning for patients who require simple palliative radiotherapy techniques (<= 2 beams) for bone metastases.METHODS: Patients undergoing palliative radiation therapy for bone metastases were eligible. The study oncologists first documented the intended treatment target, defined the treatment target/field using digital radiographs (2D), followed by using full 3D planning computerized tomography volumetric datasets. Treatment plans were compared dosimetrically, and patient-reported outcomes (pain, fatigue, anorexia, and nausea) were compared against a historical cohort treated with 2D plans.RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled in the study group. Review of the 3D datasets led to changes in the target area of interest in 44/85 (52 %) of cases, of which 21/85 (25 %) were clinically significant. 3D plans resulted in superior target coverage and normal tissue sparing. There was no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes however.CONCLUSION: 3D radiotherapy planning resulted in superior treatment plans but we were unable to demonstrate a significant benefit in clinical outcomes. Prospective study designs are needed to describe the contemporary expectation of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases in the modern era of 3D planning.",Excluded

Therefore, we investigated radiosensitizing effects of vorinostat in neuroblastoma. Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines decreased cell viability and resulted in additive effects with radiation. In a murine metastatic neuroblastoma in vivo model vorinostat and radiation combinations decreased tumor volumes compared to single modality.

Thus, vorinostat potentiates anti-neoplastic effects of radiation in neuroblastoma possibly due to down-regulation of DNA repair enzyme Ku-86.",Excluded
2439,"Radiotherapy of maxillary cancer using 9 equi-spaced beam coplanar beam arrangement and 9 non-coplanar beam arrangement with beam angle optimization - A dosimetric comparison Background: IMRT is a novel radiotherapy that can deliver high conformal homogeneous dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding tissues and structures. Conventional routine IMRT usually uses equi-spaced beam arrangement of 5 to 9. However, in recent development, manipulating the beam arrangement of IMRT is offered in beam angle optimization (BAO), in which it automatically chooses optimized beam angles in either coplanar or non-coplanar beam arrangements. In Pugachev et al. (2001) study it has been suggested that improvement of the dose distribution was seen in complicated head and neck cancer cases with BAO. Nevertheless, opposite opinion has been raised by Stein et al. (1997) which stated that the marginal gain by manipulating beam angle diminished when there are more than 7 beams. Notwithstanding the controversy in study results, it was observed that careful selection of beam orientation contributed to a better dose distribution in the final treatment plan in clinical experience. This study is to investigate the dosimetric effect of manipulating beam angles with BAO in maxillary cancer cases compared with 9 equi-spaced beam co-planar arrangement. Method(s): The subjects in this study were recruited from the Princess Margaret Hospital, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the period of 1st Jan 2006 to 31st Dec 2010. Planning computed tomography (CT) images of the samples were retrospectively restored. Five samples were recruited using random sampling. It was an experimental study to test the effect of using equispaced beams, BAO and VMAT in IMRT. The parameters for comparison are tumour dose conformity, homogeneity; and the OARs maximum, mean dose. 2 plans were produced for each recruited patients. One using 9 equispaced beam arrangement and the other using 9 non-coplanar field using BAO. Result(s): For the five recruited patients, both 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement and BAO resulted in clinically satisfactory dose distribution and were of similar quality. It was found that IMRT plans with BAO resulted in better OARs sparing, including the parotid, cochlear, eyes, optic nerves, the optic chiasm and brain stem. In terms of target coverage, 4 out of 5 plans produced better in BAO when compared with 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement. Conclusion(s): The effect of the selection of beam angle orientations was significant within the samples. The choice of beam orientations is a factor affecting the dosimetric outcome even when the beam number is equal to 9.",Excluded
2963,"Role of transcranial ultrasound in postoperative early recognition of MCA occlusion in a patient underwent to MCA aneurysmal clipping: Case report Background: Aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery represent almost a third of all the aneurysms of the circle of Willis anterior sector. These aneurysms can be either angiographically coiled or surgically clipped. Surgery on these aneurysms can sometimes be quite tricky and also dangerous. Wide base, large size and irregular dome are aneurysm related factors that can affect conduct of surgery. Wide exposure, diligent isolation of perforators, prevention of vessel kinking and obliteration and selection of the most appropriate clip are essential for success Case Report: R.S. was admitted to our Emergency Department after sudden loss of consciousness (GCS 4/15) due to atypical intracerebral hemorrhage. A CT-angiography scan showed a right parietal hematoma with evidence of ruptured aneurysm in the proximal right middle cerebral artery (rMCA). She was admitted in our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after surgical hematoma evacuation and aneurysmal clipping. After 6 h, we performed TCD and TCCD to detect willis circulation and measuring pulsatily index in cerebral vessels in order to exclude intracranial hypertension. Ultrasound examination showed normal pulsatily index and the absence of flow and signal at depth and area related to rMCA. After neurosurgical consultation, a brain MRI was performed and it showed DWI images as hazy, hyperintense signals in the rMCA area (Fig) confirming TCD report. Conclusion(s): Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and Transcranial color-coded duplex (TCCD) provide a noninvasive and inexpensive (relative to angiography) noninvasive vascular test that can be used in a variety of clinical situations to provide real-time physiological information that is often unobtainable with other test-ing without increased patient risks (repeated radiation doses, contrast injections) and associated costs.

PURPOSE: The objective was to investigate autonomic control in groups of European and Chinese astronauts and to identify similarities and differences.METHODS: Beat-to-beat heart rate and finger blood pressure, brachial blood pressure, and respiratory frequency were measured from 10 astronauts (five European taking part in three different space missions and five Chinese astronauts taking part in two different space missions). Data recording was performed in the supine and standing positions at least 10 days before launch, and 1, 3, and 10 days after return. Cross-correlation analysis of heart rate and systolic pressure was used to assess cardiac baroreflex modulation. A fixed breathing protocol was performed to measure respiratory sinus arrhythmia and low-frequency power of systolic blood pressure variability.RESULTS: Although baseline cardiovascular parameters before spaceflight were similar in all astronauts in the supine position, a significant increase in sympathetic activity and a decrease in vagal modulation occurred in the European astronauts when standing; spaceflight resulted in a remarkable vagal decrease in European astronauts only. Similar baseline supine and standing values for heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and respiratory frequency were shown in both groups. Standing autonomic control was based on a balance of higher vagal and sympathetic modulation in European astronauts.CONCLUSION: Post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was observed in all European astronauts, whereas post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was significantly reduced in Chinese astronauts. The basis for orthostatic intolerance is not apparent; however, many possibilities can be considered and need to be further investigated, such as genetic diversities between races, astronaut selection, training, and nutrition, etc.",Excluded

About 10-15% of breast cancer patients develop brain metastases and historically, their survival has been poor. Introduction of novel chemotherapeutic and biologic agents and newer radiation techniques in the past decade has led to better control of systemic disease raising the possibility of increasing incidence of brain metastases as well as better control of CNS disease. The aim of this study was to determine the survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases in our practice in the last 10 years. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart analysis and we analyzed the charts of 18 patients with breast cancer who had developed brain metastases. The parameters analyzed included patient age at diagnosis of breast cancer and at development of brain metastases, receptor status and various treatment modalities used to control local as well as Metastatic disease. Result(s): The median survival time after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and the number of brain metastases was 55 months. The time to death was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model, adjusting for age and number of brain metastases. Age at diagnosis of breast cancer was significant with a p-value of 0.007 and the number of brain metastases was not significant with a p-value of 0.55. Using the Log Rank test, median survival for Her2neu positive patients was 71 months and for Her2neu negative patients was 58 months with a non-significant p value of 0.86.

Positive brain scans were found in ischemic cerebral infarction in 68% of the cases; with a relatively low rate in the early phase from the onset of the illness showing a peak of positive scans in 2 to 4 wk with a gradual decline. Even those with a positive scan turned negative after 8 wk. A definite correlation between the clinical severity and positive scan was found. In cases with cortical involvement positive brain scan was observed in high frequency. Single brain scan yielded only a value of screening procedure but follow-up examinations in the course of illness proved to be rather important for the differential diagnosis of underlying pathology and further for fortelling the prognosis. In view of the prognosis of motor functions those with an intense uptake of radioisotope, a relatively large sized and persistent abnormality were likely left with severe neurological deficit while in cases who showed a mild and transient positive scan the recovery of motor functions were favorable. When rate of positive scan for the respective territory of cerebral vessels were evaluated, positive scans were most frequently observed in the vicinity of middle cerebral artery. The frequency of positive scans in the territory of posterior cerebral artery and vertebro-basilar artery were found lowest. Brain scanning was found most suitable for the diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, subdural hematoma and SLE vasculitis but it exhibited merely low rate of posivity in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage and transient ischemic attack.

Methods and Materials: The records of 101 patients with multiple myeloma irradiated for palliation at the University of Arizona between 1975 and 1990 were reviewed. Three hundred sixteen sites were treated. Ten sites were asymptomatic, including six hemibody fields with advanced disease unresponsive to chemotherapy and four local fields with impending pathological fractures. Three hundred six evaluable symptomatic sites remained. The most common symptom was bone pain. Other symptoms included neurological impairment and a palpable mass. Result(s): Total tumor dose ranged from 3.0 to 60 Gy, with a mean of 25 Gy. Symptom relief was obtained in 297 of 306 evaluable symptomatic sites (97%). Complete relief of symptoms was obtained in 26% and partial relief in 71%. Symptom relief was obtained in 92% of sites receiving a total dose less than 10 Gy (n = 13) and 98% of sites receiving 10 Gy or more (n = 293). No dose-response could be demonstrated. The likelihood of symptom relief was not influenced by the location of the lesion or the use of concurrent chemotherapy. Of the 297 responding sites, 6% (n = 19) relapsed after a median symptom-free interval of 16 months. Neither the probability of relapse nor the time to relapse was related to the radiation dose. Retreatment of relapsing sites provided effective palliation in all cases. Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy is effective in palliating local symptoms in multiple myeloma.

There exist no data regarding the local control benefits (if any) of surgery prior to SRS. Materials/Methods: Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all patients undergoing SRS with or without prior tumor excision at our institution. No patient had received prior WBXRT. Factors related to patient survival were determined by Cox regression; time-torecurrence (TTR) was analyzed similarly but with robust residuals to account for clustering. Non-progressing tumors which received WBXRT (for another progressing tumor) were censored at time of WBXRT. There were 162 patients identified (82/80 M/F, average 65.3), with a total of 260 tumors, of which 119 were solitary. Although surgical patients were younger, had better performance status and less burden of disease compared to SRS alone, none of these differences were statistically significant, although the RPA class was significantly better in the SRS+ surgery group (p = .003, Mann-Whitney). Forty-nine patients had a total of 51 tumors resected (2 patients with 2 resected), of which 33 were solitary. Complete resection, as determined by 24-hour contrasted MRI, was achieved in 45 (88%). A total of 73 tumors (28%) in 45 patients were considered to have locally progressed, 20 of which had previously undergone resection. Result(s): Median survival for all patients was 8.7 months, with survival for complete resection + SRS, incomplete resection + SRS and SRS alone at 14.1, 7.1, and 6.9 months, respectively (p = .03, log-rank). Survival by RPA class was 26.9, 8.7, and 1.5 for classes 1-3, respectively (p = .0004, log-rank). Median TTR was 14.8 months for all tumors, with TTR for complete resection + SRS, incomplete resection + SRS and SRS alone at 22.5, 6.4, and 14.8 months respectively (p = .004, log-rank). In the stepwise Cox regression analysis, overall survival was related to age (HR = 1.02, p = 0.037), ECOG performance score (HR = 1.9, p = 0.0001) and complete surgical excision (HR = .55, p = 0.01). Analysis of TTR demonstrated the following significantly related factors: radiation sensitive pathology (non-renal or melanoma) (HR = 0.367, p = 0.01), tumor size (HR = 1.43, p = 0.0012), and complete tumor resection (HR = 0.348, p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Although complete surgical excision + SRS are associated with prolonged survival, results may be skewed due to selection bias.

3267,"Ophthalmologic outcomes after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in non-conjunctival ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma In the present study, we evaluated the ophthalmologic outcomes of 24 patients who received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for the treatment of non-conjunctival ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type (MALT) lymphoma. Ophthalmologic outcomes were assessed in patients who received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy from March 2004 until May 2010. Outcomes were determined according to common symptoms following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, which consisted of decreased visual acuity, dry eye symptoms, retinopathy, optic neuropathy, increased intraocular pressure, and blepharitis. Nine patients received chemotherapy alone, eight patients received radiotherapy alone, and seven patients received chemotherapy with additional radiotherapy (chemoradiation therapy). Patients treated by chemotherapy alone showed better ophthalmologic outcome scores (mean score, 1.56) than those treated by radiation alone or chemoradiation therapy (mean score, 4.01). In conclusion, the treatment of ocular adnexal lymphoma including radiotherapy showed poor ophthalmologic outcomes due to radiation-induced complications. Recently, many new treatment options have emerged, such as immunotherapy or radioimmunotherapy. In the future study, to select a better treatment modality with fewer complications, well-designed prospective trials with ophthalmologic outcomes are needed.",Excluded

3093,"Biopsy of enlarging lesions after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases frequently reveals radiation necrosis Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers excellent local control for brain metastases (BM) with low rates of toxicity. Radiation necrosis (RN) may occur after treatment and is challenging to distinguish from local recurrence (LR). We evaluated enlarging brain lesions following SRS that were subsequently biopsied to differentiate RN versus LR.Methods: This study reviewed patients receiving SRS for BM between 2008 and 2012 who underwent a biopsy for suspicion of RN versus LR on MRI. Data collection included demographics, radiation parameters, imaging findings, and post-biopsy pathology. Kaplan-Meier methods determined overall survival. Fisher's exact test assessed for association between lesion biopsy result and variables of interest.Results: Thirty-four patients with 35 biopsied BM were included. Lesions were biopsied a median of 8.8 months after SRS. Most patients had primary lung cancer (11; 31.4%). Eleven (31.4%) biopsies were positive for LR and 24 (68.6%) showed RN only. Median overall survival was longer for patients with RN (31.0 mo) than for patients with LR (14.5 mo; P = 0.135). Time from SRS to biopsy was significantly different between RN and LR groups; 10 lesions (52.5%) biopsied <=9 months after SRS showed LR, whereas 1 lesion (6.3%) biopsied >9 months after SRS showed LR (P = 0.004). For 16 (65.7%) lesions, management was changed or directed by the biopsy results.Conclusions: Stereotactic biopsy for accessible enlarging lesions after SRS appears diagnostically valuable in patients with few lesions and changes clinical management. RN should be suspected in patients with an enlarging lesion more than 9 months post-SRS.",Excluded

Method(s): 1082 consecutive patients were categorised as non-obese (NO, body mass index (BMI) <30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, n = 688), obese (O, BMI 30-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, n = 354) or morbidly obese (MO, BMI >=40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, n = 40). Demographic and procedural information was collated. Monte Carlo simulations modelled radiation dosimetric data. Result(s): Obese and morbidly obese patients were younger (p = 0.016), more frequently female (p = 0.036), more frequently diabetic (p < 0.0001), with better renal function (p < 0.0001), and prior PCI (p = 0.01). There was no difference in major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE) (NO = 1.2%, O = 0.8%, MO = 2.5%, p = NS), acute kidney injury, bleeding, length of stay, 30-day readmission or 30-day mortality. Obese and morbidly obese patients received increased contrast (NO = 180 [150-230]mL, O = 190 [160-250]mL, MO = 200 [165-225]mL, p = 0.016), dose area product (NO = 75.56 [50.61-113.69]Gycm<sup>2</sup>, O = 116.4 [76.11-157.82]Gycm<sup>2</sup>, MO = 125.62 [92.22-158.81]Gycm<sup>2</sup>, p < 0.0001), entrance air kerma (NO = 1439.42 [977.0-2075.5]mGy, O = 2111.63 [1492.0-3011.0]mGy, MO = 2376.0 [1700.0-3234.42]mGy, p < 0.0001), and peak skin dose (NO = 1439.42 [977.0-2075.5], O = 2111.63 [1492.0-3011.0], MO = 2376.0 [1700.0-3234.42], p < 0.0001).

2772,"Effects on the photoresponse of calcium buffers and cyclic GMP incorporated into the cytoplasm of retinal rods It is generally accepted that the light response in retinal rods involves a reduction of ionic permeability (predominantly to Na+) in the plasma membrane of the outer segment and that this is mediated by an internal messenger which diffuses between the disk and plasma membranes. There is controversy, however, over the identity of the diffusible substance; two alternative schemes have received widespread support (for review see refs 1,2). According to the 'calcium hypothesis', light stimulates the release into the cytoplasm of calcium, leading to the blockage of channels which are normally open in darkness, whereas based on the 'cyclic nucleotide hypothesis', cyclic GMP causes the opening of channels in the dark, but is hydrolysed by a light-activated phosphodiesterase. We report here effects of introducing calcium buffers and cyclic GMP into the rod cytoplasm by means of a patch pipette, which seem to be inconsistent with the calcium hypothesis.",Excluded
2616,"LET dependence on killing effect and mutagenicity in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa PURPOSE: To assess the unique biological effects of different forms of ionizing radiation causing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), we compared the killing effect, mutagenesis frequency, and mutation type spectrum using the model filamentous fungus Neurospora.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Asexual spores of wild-type Neurospora and two DSB repair-deficient strains [one homologous recombination- and the other non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway-deficient] were irradiated with argon (Ar)-ion beams, ferrous (Fe)-ion beams, or X-rays. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), forward mutation frequencies at the ad-3 loci, and mutation spectra at the ad-3B gene were determined.RESULTS: The canonical NHEJ (cNHEJ)-deficient strain showed resistance to higher X-ray doses, while other strains showed dose-dependent sensitivity. In contrast, the killing effects of Ar-ion and Fe-ion beam irradiation were dose-dependent in all strains tested. The rank order of RBE was Ar-ion > Fe-ion > C-ion. Deletion mutations were the most common, but deletion size incremented with the increasing value of linear energy transfer (LET).CONCLUSIONS: We found marked differences in killing effect of a cNHEJ-deficient mutant between X-ray and high-LET ion beam irradiations (Ar and Fe). The mutation spectra also differed between irradiation types. These differences may be due to the physical properties of each radiation and the repair mechanism of induced damage in Neurospora crassa. These results may guide the choice of irradiation beam to kill or mutagenize fungi for agricultural applications or further research.",Excluded
2946,"Impact of exercise with TheraBite device on trismus and health-related quality of life: A prospective study Trismus is a common symptom in patients with head and neck cancer that affects many aspects of daily life negatively. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of structured exercise with the jaw-mobilizing device TheraBite on trismus, trismus-related symptomatology, and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with head and neck cancer. Fifteen patients with trismus (maximum interincisal opening [MIO] <=35 mm) after oncologic treatment for head and neck cancer, underwent a 10-week exercise program with the TheraBite device and were followed regularly. Time between oncologic treatment and start of TheraBite exercise ranged from 0.7 to 14.8 years (average 6.2 years). MIO, trismus-related symptoms, and HRQL was assessed before and after exercise and after 6 months. A significant improvement in MIO was observed post-exercise (3.5 mm, 15.3%, p = 0.0002) and after 6-month of follow-up (4.7 mm, 22.1%, p = 0.0029). A statistically significant correlation was found between increased MIO and fewer trismus-related symptoms. In conclusion, exercise with TheraBite improved MIO and trismus-related symptoms in patients with trismus secondary to head and neck cancer. Structured exercise with the jaw-mobilizing device seems to be beneficial for patients with trismus independent of time since oncologic treatment.",Excluded
2470,"Light-Dependent OCT Structure Changes in Photoreceptor Degenerative rd 10 Mouse Retina Purpose: Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to analyze the effects of light/dark adaptation in a mouse model of inherited photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), and to study dynamics of subretinal fluid during the progress of retinal degeneration.Methods: rd10 and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were reared in cyclic light or darkness and imaged with Bioptigen UHR-OCT or Spectralis HRA+OCT after adaptation to either light or darkness.Results: OCT images from rd10 mice were analyzed at three progressive stages of degeneration. After light-adaptation, stage I (postnatal age [P]26-29) eyes demonstrated no apparent subretinal fluid. At stage II (P32-38), subretinal fluid was present and restricted to parapapillary area, while at stage III (P44-45) extensive subretinal fluid was present across many retinal areas. Following overnight dark-adaptation, WT eyes showed a large reduction in outer retinal thickness (4.6 +/- 1.4 mum, n = 16), whereas this change was significantly smaller in stage I rd10 eyes (1.5 +/- 0.5 mum, n = 14). In stage II rd10 eyes, dark-adaptation significantly reduced the extent of subretinal fluid, with the amount of reduction correlating with the amount of fluid pre-existing in the light-adapted state. However, dark-adaptation did not significantly alter the amount of subretinal fluid observed in stage III rd10 mice. In addition, dark-rearing of rd10 mice from P6 to P30 slowed retinal degeneration.Conclusions: Visual experience in the form of light/dark adaptation exerts a significant effect on outer retinal structure in the context of photoreceptor degeneration. This effect may arise from light-dependent alterations in fluid transport across the RPE monolayer, and promote photoreceptor survival as induced by dark-rearing.",Excluded
3083,"Dosimetric comparison of helical tomotherapy treatment plans for total marrow irradiation created using GPU and CPU dose calculation engines PURPOSE: To compare optimization characteristics, plan quality, and treatment delivery efficiency between total marrow irradiation (TMI) plans using the new TomoTherapy graphic processing unit (GPU) based dose engine and CPU/cluster based dose engine.METHODS: Five TMI plans created on an anthropomorphic phantom were optimized and calculated with both dose engines. The planning treatment volume (PTV) included all the bones from head to mid femur except for upper extremities. Evaluated organs at risk (OAR) consisted of lung, liver, heart, kidneys, and brain. The following treatment parameters were used to generate the TMI plans: field widths of 2.5 and 5 cm, modulation factors of 2 and 2.5, and pitch of either 0.287 or 0.43. The optimization parameters were chosen based on the PTV and OAR priorities and the plans were optimized with a fixed number of iterations. The PTV constraint was selected to ensure that at least 95% of the PTV received the prescription dose. The plans were evaluated based on D80 and D50 (dose to 80% and 50% of the OAR volume, respectively) and hotspot volumes within the PTVs. Gamma indices (GAMMA) were also used to compare planar dose distributions between the two modalities. The optimization and dose calculation times were compared between the two systems. The treatment delivery times were also evaluated.RESULTS: The results showed very good dosimetric agreement between the GPU and CPU calculated plans for any of the evaluated planning parameters indicating that both systems converge on nearly identical plans. All D80 and D50 parameters varied by less than 3% of the prescription dose with an average difference of 0.8%. A gamma analysis GAMMA(3%, 3 mm) < 1 of the GPU plan resulted in over 90% of calculated voxels satisfying GAMMA < 1 criterion as compared to baseline CPU plan. The average number of voxels meeting the GAMMA < 1 criterion for all the plans was 97%. In terms of dose optimization/calculation efficiency, there was a 20-fold reduction in planning time with the new GPU system. The average optimization/dose calculation time utilizing the traditional CPU/cluster based system was 579 vs 26.8 min for the GPU based system. There was no difference in the calculated treatment delivery time per fraction. Beam-on time varied based on field width and pitch and ranged between 15 and 28 min.CONCLUSIONS: The TomoTherapy GPU based dose engine is capable of calculating TMI treatment plans with plan quality nearly identical to plans calculated using the traditional CPU/cluster based system, while significantly reducing the time required for optimization and dose calculation.",Excluded

3228,"Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix: Does treatment sequence and type of hysterectomy improve outcomes? Objectives: Small cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer is rare, with a high propensity for distant metastasis, and there is no consensus on optimal treatment. Treatment of early-stage disease usually involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), and surgery. Our goal was to assess the outcomes of various treatment modalities and sequences of treatments and to identify prognostic factors associated with survival. Method(s): Patients with small cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer reported to the National Cancer Database from 1998 to 2011 who underwent at least a total hysterectomy (radical or simple)were selected. To exclude for potentially palliative interventions, we included only patients with stage I-IIA disease for this analysis. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, univariate comparisons were made with log-rank tests, and multivariable analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. All tests were two-tailed, with threshold significance level set at P < 0.05. Result(s): A total of 1703 small cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer patients were identified, and 249 patients met inclusion criteria. Increasing tumor size was significantly associated with nodal positivity (14%, 26%, 34%, and 63% for tumor sizes <=2 cm, 2.1-3 cm, 3.1-5 cm, and >5 cm, respectively, P=0.001). Lymph node metastasis was significantly associated with worse survival (median OS 35 vs. 108 months for lymph node-positive and -negative, respectively, P=0.012). No other factors were found to be associated with survival on univariate analyses, including age, stage, comorbidity index, tumor size, type of surgery, margin status, use of chemotherapy, and use of RT. On multivariable analysis using historically significant factors of cervical cancer survival, including age, race, comorbidity index, stage, tumor size, RT, chemotherapy, and hysterectomy type, only positive nodal status (HR 4.317, 95% CI 1.132-16.464, P = 0.032) significantly predicted survival. Conclusion(s): Nodal metastasis is a poor prognostic factor in small cell neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix. The type of hysterectomy, receipt of chemotherapy, or timing of radiation (adjuvant vs. neoadjuvant) did not appear to affect OS. Optimal treatment of this disease remains elusive.",Excluded
3516,Aortic arch injection with C-arm cone beam CT for radiosurgery treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Technical note Background: C-arm cone beam CT (CBCT) with selective intra-arterial contrast injection combined with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is currently used for the evaluation and treatment planning of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In some instances an AVM will derive its blood supply from more than one main cervical artery (carotid and/or vertebral artery) and a single-vessel injection will not adequately demonstrate the entire AVM nidus. Method(s): Three patients with cerebral AVM in whom the entire nidus could not be visualized by injection of a single cervical artery are reported. CBCT dataset acquisition was performed by intra-arterial contrast injection in the ascending thoracic aorta through a 5 F pigtail catheter. The injection of diluted iodinated contrast agent (35%) lasted 22 s at a rate of 8 ml/s for a total volume of 176 ml (61.6 ml of contrast agent). The dataset was then processed using standard reconstruction methods. Result(s): Contrast injection in the ascending aorta during a single CBCT acquisition provided a volumetric dataset adequate for subsequent radiosurgical treatment planning. Conclusion(s): This is a safe and effective angiographic technique for the acquisition of volumetric datasets using CBCT that are suitable for treatment planning of intracranial AVMs deriving their blood supply from more than one major cervical artery. This technique allows imaging of the entire AVM nidus during a single CBCT acquisition.,Excluded

The study has confirmed that under normal conditions a very small part of the P. cell population in rats (less than 3%) possesses a Feulgen-DNA surplus ranging from 2C to 4C. In mice, the hyperdiploid (H2C) P. cells are even more rare. The occurrence of H2C-P. cells in rats and probably also in mice has not been substantially changed in animals exposed to factors interfering with chromatin structure and/or its template activity; the H2C-P. cells seem to be slightly more frequent after injecting mice with corticoids (Urbason) or in animals suffering from ectromelia or hereditary Purkinje cell degeneration. The incidence of H2C-P. cells has neither been substantially affected by experimental conditions which are known to lead to functional and/or metabolic stimulation of the cerebellum. Functional changes in the number of H2C-P. cell nuclei may, however, be short-term or transient in character and therefore might have excaped detection in our models.

Method(s): 233 patients with 257 meningeoma of the skull base (71.2%), falx (12.1%), convexity (14.4%) and meningeomatosis (2.3%) were treated between 01/2002 and 01/2015 at the Erlangen University Hospital. 81.7% (210) of patients received SRT postoperatively and 18.3% (47) as primary treatment. 119 (46.3%) had a WHO grade I, 64 (24.9%) grade II, 16 (6.2%) grade III meningioma. In 58 cases no histology was obtained, whereas 47 (18.3%) of which received SRT alone. SRT was given in 28 or 30 fractions. The lesion (PTV) received a median reference dose of 54.0 (range: 35.50- 66.60) Gy in single fraction of 1.80 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up at the time of overall survival (OS) analysis was 38.10 (range: 0.46-130.03) months. Local control rate was 97% at 5- and 83% at 10 years.

There are impediments to this, one being CBCT number accuracy. The purpose of this study was to investigate CBCT number correction methods and the affect of residual inaccuracies on dose deposition. Four different correction strategies were applied to the same patient data to compare performance and the sophistication of correction-method needed for acceptable dose errors. Methods and Materials: Planning CT and CBCT reconstructions were used for 12 patients (6 brain, 3 prostate, and 3 bladder cancer patients). All patients were treated using Elekta linear accelerators and XVI imaging systems. Two of the CBCT number correction methods investigated were based on an algorithm previously proposed by the authors but only previously applied to phantoms. Two further methods, based on an approach previously suggested in the research literature, were also examined. Dose calculations were performed using scans of a ""worst"" subset of patients using the Pinnacle<sup>3</sup> version 9.0 treatment planning system and the patients' clinical plans. Result(s): All mean errors in CBCT number were <50 HU, and all correction methods performed well or adequately in dose calculations. The worst single dose discrepancy identified for any of the examined methods or patients was 3.0%. Mean errors in the doses to treatment volumes or organs at risk were negatively correlated with the mean error in CT number. That is, a mean CT number that was too large, averaged over the entire CBCT volume, implied an underdosing in a volume-of-interest and vice versa. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that (1) the correction of CBCT numbers to within a mean error of 50 HU in the scan volume provides acceptable discrepancies in dose (<3%) and (2) this is achievable with even quite unsophisticated correction methods. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

3419,"The influence of arc weights on the dose distribution for single target radiosurgery To stereotactically irradiate ellipsoidal inclined arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with a single isocenter one can use an adjusted inclined irradiation space with a reduced angular range of arcs. If one uses the maximum available irradiation space it is necessary to weight some of the arcs in order to closely encompass the lesion. It has been found that there is a relationship between the lesion inclination angle beta and the weights of arcs. Conversely when the beta angle is known, the weights of the arcs can be determined in advance by means of weighting vectors. The dose volume analysis shows that the isodose volumes remain constant for the different weighting vectors except for the 10% isodose volume which increases slightly as the linear weighting vector's slope alpha increases. Moreover, this procedure permits the optimization of the superimposition between the lesion and the reference isodose. These results enable the construction of an ""a priori knowledge"" database that can be included in an optimization algorithm procedure.",Excluded
2574,"Iatrogenic radiation exposure from neuroimaging may increase the risk of cancer and mortality in patients with epilepsy Objective:To calculate the dosage of radiation exposure of a series of patients with epilepsy and determine if this affects their estimated risk of developing cancer. Background(s): Patients with epilepsy frequently receive head imaging. Data from other populations demonstrates that radiation exposure such as that received in imaging studies may increase the risk of certain cancers and overall mortality. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed radiation exposure from imaging studies for the prior 5 years for 50 consecutive adult patients seen in a tertiary epilepsy. The original studies where reviewed to directly calculate the radiation exposure for each exam. Brain dose and bone marrow dose from SPECT, CT, FDG-PET was calculated based on published models. Result(s): The mean brain dose was 9.1 mGy and the mean bone marrow dose was 2.3 mGy. According to Pearce's mode this amount of radiation exposure doubles the risk of developing brain cancer or leukemia and by the BEIR Committee's formula, increase the risk of death from cancer by approximately 28 in 1,000,000 over the baseline risk of 2,000/1,000,000. Among the 50 patients, 17 of them had scans of either SPECT and/or CT and/or PET. These 17 patients had an average if 26.7 mGy of brain exposure and 6.8. mGy of bone marrow exposure. The highest brain exposure was 80 mGy, while the highest bone marrow exposure was 30.4 mGy. By Pearce's mode, these individuals may have up to a 3 fold increase in the risk of later developing brain tumors or leukemia. Conclusion(s): Patients with epilepsy may be at increased risk of developing fatal cancers from radiation exposure from common imaging procedures. Neurologists caring for patients with epilepsy should be judicious in ordering studies that expose patients to radiation. Population based studies are needed to see if an increased prevalence of cancer is seen in persons with epilepsy.",Excluded
3611,"Thalamic energy dysregulation drives microstructural changes of thalamocortical projections in multiple sclerosis Background and aims: Neuronal energy dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been proposed as a key driver of axonal degeneration. Diffusion-weighted 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS) can measure the diffusivity of creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr/PhCr), whose reduction in the MS thalamus has been proposed to reflect limited energy reserves. We tested in-vivo whether thalamic energy dysregulation is associated with microstructural degeneration of its projection tracts in MS. Method(s): Seventeen patients and thirteen healthy controls (HCs) underwent 3T MRI scan including DW-MRS and DW sequences. From DW-MRS, Cr apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(tCr)) was extracted in the bilateral thalami. Thalamic projections to somatosensory, dorsolateral prefrontal cortexes and optic radiations (case tracts) and the arcuate (non-thalamic control tract) were manually drawn in TrackVis (Fig.1). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), reflecting microstructural damage, were extracted for each tract. Associations between ADC(tCr) and microstructural parameters were tested using linear mixed-effect models. (Figure presented) Results: In MS, lower thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with lower mean FA and higher mean MD of pooled thalamo-cortical tracts after adjusting for disease duration, gender and tract-specific lesion load (p=0.033 and p=0.047). No correlation was found in HCs. Unadjusted tract-by-tract analysis confirmed the correlation between thalamic ADC(tCr) and MD in patients. The arcuate tract, not connected to the thalamus, showed no correlation (Fig.2). (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): Thalamic ADC(tCr) was associated with specific microstructural damage of thalamo-cortical tracts in MS, suggesting that energy dysfunction in this crucial hub - through an impaired Cr/PhCr transport/utilization - may disrupt thalamo-cortical networks by inducing the selective anterograde degeneration of connected fibers.",Excluded
2948,"Cancer incidence after localized therapy for prostate cancer BACKGROUND: Second cancers may occur in patients who have undergone radiation therapy. The risk for these adverse events after therapy is uncertain. In this study, the authors examined the size and significance of the observed association between occurrences of secondary cancers 5 years after radiotherapy in a large population of men with incident prostate cancer.METHODS: Men with incident prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and were distinguished by the type of treatment received, tumor stage, tumor grade, and age at diagnosis. SEER data also were used to identify occurrences of secondary cancer beginning 5 years after the date patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds of the subsequent occurrence of other cancers associated with types of radiation therapy received and was adjusted for the type of surgery, tumor grade, stage, and patient age.RESULTS: Compared with men who received no prostate cancer-directed radiation, men who received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as their only form of radiation therapy had statistically significant increased odds of developing secondary cancers at several sites potentially related to radiation therapy, including the bladder (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.44-1.84) and rectum (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.29-1.99). Men who received EBRT also had statistically significant higher odds of developing secondary cancers at sites in the upper body and other areas not potentially related to radiation therapy, including the cecum (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70), transverse colon (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30-2.63), brain (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22-2.75), stomach (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75), melanoma (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53), and lung and bronchus (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) compared with the odds among men who received no radiation therapy. Men who received radiation therapy in the form of radioactive implants or isotopes, either in isolation or combined with beam radiation, did not have significantly different odds of secondary cancer occurring at any of the 20 most common sites.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received with EBRT had significantly higher odds of developing second cancers both overall and in the areas that were exposed to radiation. It is noteworthy that, to the authors' knowledge, this report shows for the first time that, despite the higher doses of radiation delivered, patients who received radioactive implants had the lowest odds of developing second cancers.",Included

For agents administered by CED, changes on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging directly resulting from catheter placement, infusion, and the therapeutic compound may confound any interpretation of tumor progression. As part of an ongoing multiinstitutional Phase I study, 14 patients with recurrent malignant glioma underwent CED of interleukin (IL) 13-PE38QQR, a recombinant cytotoxin consisting of human IL-13 conjugated with a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin.

METHOD(S): Patients were treated in two groups: Group 1 patients received IL13-PE38QQR before and after tumor resection; Group 2 patients received infusion only after tumor resection. Preoperative and postinfusion MR images were obtained prospectively at specified regular intervals. Changes were noted along catheter tracks on postresection MR images obtained in all patients. A simple grading system was developed to describe these changes. When MR imaging changes appeared to be related to IL1 3-PE38QQR, patients were followed up without instituting new antitumor therapy. CONCLUSION(S): As CED of therapeutic agents becomes more common, clinicians and investigators must become aware of associated neuroimaging changes that should be incorporated into toxicity assessment. We have developed a simple grading system to facilitate communication about these changes among investigators. Biological imaging modalities that could possibly distinguish these changes from recurrent tumor should be evaluated. In this study the authors demonstrate the challenges in determining efficacy when surrogate end points such as time to tumor progression as defined by new or progressive contrast enhancement on MR imaging are used with this treatment modality.",Excluded

Female astronauts are more susceptible to orthostatic intolerance after space flight; the visual impairment intracranial pressure syndrome predominates slightly in males. Since spaceflight simulates vascular aging, sex-specific effects on vascular endothelium and thrombotic risk warrant examination as predisposing factors to atherosclerosis, important as the current cohort of astronauts ages. Currently, 20% of astronauts are women, and the recently selected astronaut recruits are 50% women. Thus there should be expectation that future research will reflect the composition of the overall population to determine potential benefits or risks. This should apply both to clinical studies and to basic science research.",Excluded

The amount of phosphatidylcholine and phosphati- dylinositol dropped, and the amount of sphingomyelin and cholesterol increased in the nuclei ofglial cells of the neocortex. Sphingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol of neuronal nuclei are involved in the dynamics of the CNS syndrome in mammals.

3397,"Treatment of near-skull brain tissue with a focused device using shear-mode conversion: a numerical study Shear mode transmission through the skull has been previously proposed as a new trans-skull propagation technique for noninvasive therapeutic ultrasound (Clement 2004 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115 1356-64). The main advantage of choosing shear over longitudinal mode resides on the fact that there is less wavefront distortion with the former. In the present study, the regions of the brain suitable for shear-mode transmission were established for a simple focused ultrasound device. The device consists of a spherically curved transducer that has a focal length of 10 cm, an aperture between 30 degrees and 60 degrees and operates at 0.74 MHz. The regions suitable for shear-mode transmission were determined by the shear wave acoustic windows that matched the shape of the device acoustic field. The acoustic windows were calculated using segmentation and triangulation of outer and inner faces of skull from 3D-MRI head datasets. Nine heads of healthy adults were analyzed. The surface considered for the calculations was the head region found above the supra-orbital margin. For every inspected point in the brain volume, the axis of the device was determined by the vector between this inspection point and a point located in the center of the brain. Numerical predictions of the acoustic field, where shear-mode conversion through the skull was considered, were obtained and compared to the case of water-only conditions. The brain tissue that is close to the skull showed suitable acoustic windows for shear waves. The central region of the brain seems to be unreachable using shear-mode. Analysis of the acoustic fields showed a proportional relation between the acoustic window for shear mode and the effective degree of focusing. However, this relation showed significant differences among specimens. In general, highly focused fields were obtained when the acoustic window for shear waves (A(SW)) intersected more than 67% of the entering acoustic window (A(TX)) of the device. The average depth from the inner surface of the skull showing this intersection value was 13 +/- 10 mm (mean +/- SD). The differences of the degree of focusing observed among patients suggest that the intersection A(SW) intersection A(TX) can be used as a preliminary criterion for screening and calculation of the acoustic fields should confirm the degree of focusing patient by patient. In conclusion, shear waves provide a useful method for trans-cranial focusing in regions close to the skull surface.",Excluded
2398,"Enhanced cellular radiation sensitivity of androgen-independent human prostate tumor cells by onconase The RNase-like onconase, isolated from amphibian oocytes, showed increases in median tumor pO2 in solid tumors (1). This led us to consider if onconase could decrease cellular O2 consumption (QO2) on 9L rat glioma as well as DU145 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells. Using a Clark-type electrode chamber, we observed that onconase significantly inhibited QO2 in both tumors we tested. Since onconase-induced reduction in QO2 could lead to increases in radiation sensitivity, due to the diffusion of O2 to previously hypoxic tumor cells, we used androgen-insensitive DU145 cells to study onconase-induced changes in radiation sensitivity in vitro. Radiation sensitization was achieved with > 5 micrograms/ml of onconase, regardless of the p53 status of tumor cells. Data presented here suggested that onconase-induced enhancement in radiation sensitization in vitro of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells warranted further studies of radiation responses in vivo, prior to clinical settings for the advanced-stages of prostate cancer.",Excluded
2801,"Effects of combined immune and radiation cancer therapy on inflammatory environment in the brain of a mouse model Purpose/Objective(s): Cancer patients often report behavioral and cognitive changes following cancer treatment. These can include difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and increased anxiety. Though changes are often associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or cranial irradiation, these effects are also seen in patients who receive peripheral but no cranial irradiation and no chemotherapy. A proinflammatory environment in the brain may mediate these effects. Neuroinflammation mediates cognitive impairments in other neurological disorders. Its role in cancer-related neurological dysfunction is likely relevant given novel treatments combining peripheral radiotherapy (RT) with immune activation. However, little is known about how these treatments might affect the brain, in individuals with or without tumors. Our preliminary research has identified an association between treatments combining immune activation and RT and impairments in cognitive measures. Here, we investigate the role of neuroinflammation in these effects. We hypothesize that cognitive impairments following treatment with immunotherapy and RT will be associated with increased expression of neuromodulatory inflammatory cytokines. Materials/Methods: Our project utilizes anti-CTLA4 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy preceding precision CT-guided peripheral RT to closely model clinical treatment. C57BL/6J mice with or without injected hind flank 3LL lung carcinoma were used. Mice received sham, RT-only, anti-CTLA4-only, or RT+anti-CTLA4 treatment. Mice were exposed to two identical objects and 24 hours later reintroduced to one familiar object and one novel object. Mice that recognize the familiar object will spend more time exploring the novel object. The percent time exploring the novel object out of the total time exploring both objects is calculated to determine object recognition. Following cognitive testing, brain tissue was harvested and used in an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 20-plex (GM-CSF, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-1b, IL-4, MIG, KC, VEGF, IL-17, MIP-1a, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, IL-5, FGF-Basic, IL-1a, IFN-g, IL-13, MCP-1, and IP-10). Result(s): In the animals that did not receive tumors, object recognition was seen in control mice and mice receiving either RT or anti-CTLA-4 alone, but not in mice receiving both treatments. In mice receiving tumors, only the mice that received RT alone showed novel object recognition. Conclusion(s): While combining immune activation and RT optimizes tumor control, it is associated with cognitive impairments. Data from 20-plex are currently being analyzed. We will determine how levels of cytokines and chemokines might be altered by the various treatments and whether they are associated with behavioral and cognitive performance.

The mainstay of treatment is high dose irradiation. Complications from radiotherapy are not uncommon especially to those nearby structures such as vertebrae and spinal cord. A 57 year-old gentleman with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who was treated with chemo-radiation (total of 35 fractions,70Gy) presented to us 6 months post therapy with bilateral nasal discharge and progressive neck stiffness. Nasoendoscopy showed inflamed nasophayngeal mucosa and Computed Tomography (CT) brain and cervical spine showed retropharyngeal and anterior epidural collection with extension into atlantoaxial bone and spinal cord compression. Histopathological specimen revealed features of chronic inflammations with multiple actinomycetes colonies. Our patient suffered severe neck stiffness and loss of sensations on both upper limbs. He was treated conservatively with Halo vest and intravenous antibiotics for 8 weeks and recovered fully. Irradiation in NPC is known to cause devastating complications to cervical spine such as osteoradionecrosis, osteomyelitis. It also renders tissues hypoxic and risk of getting rare infection like actinomycosis. This report can represent a great diagnostic and therapeutic challenge with differentials of tumor recurrence, osteoradionecrosis or osteomyelitis.

3067,"A strategy for the use of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) on linear accelerators and its impact on treatment margins for prostate cancer patients Background and Purpose: In external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer, the consideration of various systematic error types leads to wide treatment margins compromising normal tissue tolerance. We investigated if systematic set-up errors can be reduced by a set of initial image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) sessions. Patients and Methods: 27 patients received daily IGRT resulting in a set of 882 cone-beam computed tomographies (CBCTs). After matching to bony structures, we analyzed the dimensions of remaining systematic errors from zero up to six initial IGRT sessions and aimed at a restriction of daily IGRT for 10% of all patients. For threshold definition, we determined the standard deviations (SD) of the shift corrections and selected patients out of this range for daily image guidance. To calculate total treatment margins, we demanded for a cumulative clinical target volume (CTV) coverage of at least 95% of the specified dose in 90% of all patients. Result(s): The gain of accuracy was largest during the first three IGRTs. In order to match precision and workload criteria, thresholds for the SD of the corrections of 3.5 mm, 2.0 mm and 4.5 mm in the left-right (L-R), cranial-caudal (C-C), and anterior-posterior (A-P) direction, respectively, were identified. Including all other error types, the total margins added to the CTV amounted to 8.6 mm in L-R, 10.4 mm in C-C, and 14.4 mm in A-P direction. Conclusion(s): Only initially performed IGRT might be helpful for eliminating gross systematic errors especially after virtual simulation. However, even with daily IGRT performance, a substantial PTV margin reduction is only achievable by matching internal markers instead of bony anatomical structures. © 2008 Urban & Vogel.",Excluded
3496,"The homeobox transcription factor Even-skipped regulates acquisition of electrical properties in Drosophila neurons BACKGROUND: While developmental processes such as axon pathfinding and synapse formation have been characterized in detail, comparatively less is known of the intrinsic developmental mechanisms that regulate transcription of ion channel genes in embryonic neurons. Early decisions, including motoneuron axon targeting, are orchestrated by a cohort of transcription factors that act together in a combinatorial manner. These transcription factors include Even-skipped (Eve), islet and Lim3. The perdurance of these factors in late embryonic neurons is, however, indicative that they might also regulate additional aspects of neuron development, including the acquisition of electrical properties.RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that a combinatorial code transcription factor is also able to influence the acquisition of electrical properties in embryonic neurons we utilized the molecular genetics of Drosophila to manipulate the expression of Eve in identified motoneurons. We show that increasing expression of this transcription factor, in two Eve-positive motoneurons (aCC and RP2), is indeed sufficient to affect the electrical properties of these neurons in early first instar larvae. Specifically, we observed a decrease in both the fast K+ conductance (IKfast) and amplitude of quantal cholinergic synaptic input. We used charybdotoxin to pharmacologically separate the individual components of IKfast to show that increased Eve specifically down regulates the Slowpoke (a BK Ca2+-gated potassium channel), but not Shal, component of this current. Identification of target genes for Eve, using DNA adenine methyltransferase identification, revealed strong binding sites in slowpoke and nAcRalpha-96Aa (a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit). Verification using real-time PCR shows that pan-neuronal expression of eve is sufficient to repress transcripts for both slo and nAcRalpha-96Aa.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that Eve is sufficient to regulate both voltage- and ligand-gated currents in motoneurons, extending its known repertoire of action beyond its already characterized role in axon guidance. Our data are also consistent with a common developmental program that utilizes a defined set of transcription factors to determine both morphological and functional neuronal properties.",Excluded
2747,"Encoding of stimulus frequency and sensor motion in the posterior medial thalamic nucleus In all sensory systems, information is processed along several parallel streams. In the vibrissa-to-barrel cortex system, these include the lemniscal system and the lesser-known paralemniscal system. The posterior medial nucleus (POm) is the thalamic structure associated with the latter pathway. Previous studies suggested that POm response latencies are positively correlated with stimulation frequency and negatively correlated with response duration, providing a basis for a phase locked loop-temporal decoding of stimulus frequency. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing response latencies of POm neurons, in both awake and anesthetized rats, to vibrissae deflections at frequencies between 0.3 and 11 Hz. We found no significant, systematic correlation between stimulation frequency and the latency or duration of POm responses. We obtained similar findings from recording in awake rats, in rats under different anesthetics, and in anesthetized rats in which the reticular activating system was stimulated. These findings suggest that stimulus frequency is not reliably reflected in response latency of POm neurons. We also tested the hypothesis that POm neurons respond preferentially to sensor motion, that is, they respond to whisking in air, without contacts. We recorded from awake, head-restrained rats while monitoring vibrissae movements. All POm neurons responded to passive whisker deflections, but none responded to noncontact whisking. Thus like their counterparts in the trigeminal ganglion, POm neurons may not reliably encode whisking kinematics. These observations suggest that POm neurons might not faithfully encode vibrissae inputs to provide reliable information on vibrissae movements or contacts.",Excluded
2497,"A phase II trial of maintenance ADAPT therapy targeting colon cancer stem cells in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer Background: Presence of cancer stem cells (CSC) appears to be the chief cause of drug resistance to cytotoxic or targeted chemotherapy.

In vitro and in vivo data suggest that 5FU activates while celecoxib inhibits and depletes these putative colorectal CSC. We retrospectively administer three year ADAPT therapy in unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) patients using capecitabine and celecoxib +/- radiation following maximal responses (complete (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)) to first-line combination chemotherapy.

3022,"Tracking target position variability using intraprostatic fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging in prostate cancer radiotherapy Modern radiotherapy has achieved substantial improvement in tumour control and toxicity rates by escalating the total dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding normal tissues. It has therefore become necessary to precisely track tumour position in order to minimise geometrical uncertainties due to setup errors and organ motion. We conducted this prospective evaluation of prostate cancer patients treated with image-guided conformal radiation therapy at our institution. We implanted three fiducial markers (gold seeds) within the prostatic gland in order to quantify daily target displacements and to generate specific margins around the clinical target volume (CTV) to create an appropriate planned target volume (PTV). Between April and December 2009, ten patients affected with localised prostate cancer were transrectally implanted with three radio-opaque markers. Each patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan for planning purposes following proper bladder and rectum preparation. During treatment two orthogonal images were acquired daily and compared with previously generated digitally reconstructed radiographs. After manual localisation, comparison between the position of the gold seeds on the portal and reference images was carried out, and a set of extrapolated lateral-lateral (LL), anterior-posterior (AP) and cranial-caudal (CC) shift corrections was calculated and recorded. Couch corrections were applied with a threshold of 3 mm displacement. Systematic and random errors for each direction were calculated either as measured according to displacement of the gold seeds prior to any couch movement and after couch position correction according to the radio-opaque markers. For skin marks, mean systematic and random errors were 0.12+2.94 mm for LL, 1.04+3.37 mm for AP, -1.14+2.71 mm for CC, whereas for seed markers, mean and systematic errors were 0.6+1.5 mm for LL, 0.51+2.45 mm for AP and -0.25+2.51 mm for CC. A scatter plot generated on all measurements after couch repositioning according to gold-seed displacement suggested a confidence range of shift distributions within 5 mm for LL, 8 mm for CC, and 7 mm for AP. The total systematic and random components were then used to calculate proper PTV in patients receiving conventional treatment (7 mm for LL and 9 mm for both AP and CC). Prostate positional variability during a course of radiation treatment is strongly influenced by setup and organ motion. Organ tracking through fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging is able to reduce the spread of displacements, significantly contributing to improve the ballistic precision of radiation delivery.",Excluded
2604,"Furosemide potentiates the anticonvulsant action of valproate in the mouse maximal electroshock seizure model Accumulating evidence indicates that furosemide (FUR, a loop diuretic) exerts the anticonvulsant action in various in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of FUR on the protective action of numerous conventional and newer antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine [CBZ], lamotrigine [LTG], oxcarbazepine [OXC], phenobarbital [PB], topiramate [TPM] and valproate [VPA]) in the mouse maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model. Results indicate that FUR (up to 100mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the test) neither altered the threshold for electroconvulsions nor protected the animals against MES-induced seizures in mice. FUR (100 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the anticonvulsant effects of VPA in the MES test by reducing its ED(50) value from 230.4 to 185.4 mg/kg (P<0.05). In contrast, FUR at 100 mg/kg had no significant effect on the antielectroshock action of the remaining drugs tested (CBZ, LTG, OXC, PB, and TPM) in mice. Estimation of free plasma and total brain VPA concentrations revealed that the observed interaction between FUR and VPA in the MES test was pharmacodynamic in nature because neither free plasma nor total brain VPA concentrations were altered after i.p. administration of FUR. In conclusion, one can ascertain that the selective potentiation of the antielectroshock action of VPA by FUR and lack of any pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs, make this combination of pivotal importance for epileptic patients treated with VPA and received FUR from other than epilepsy reasons.",Excluded

Aim(s): We asked whether a similar gradient of damage occurs in deep grey matter thalamic nuclei as an effect of intrathecal/subependymal inflammation. Method(s): We examined dorsomedial thalamic nuclei tissues and paired CSF samples from 41 post-mortem secondary progressive MS (SPMS) cases, counting MHC-classII+ microglia/ macrophages and NeuN+ neurons in 10 SPMS cases with meningeal tertiary- lymphoid-like structures(TLS+), 10 SPMS cases without meningeal TLS(TLS-) and 5 controls. Result(s): Thalamic demyelination was observed in 90% of cases, and active lesions in 40%. MS cases exhibited significant reduction in NeuN+ neuronal density compared to controls, and this damage exhibited a CSForiented gradient, greatest (26%) in subventricular locations with respect to 12% at 10 mm from the ependyma/ CSF boundary. The gradient was reversed for MHC-II+ microglia density, which was increased by over 50% at 2 mm from the ventricular surface vs 15% at 10 mm. Most of the periventricular MHC-II+ cells (70%) expressed the resident-homeostatic marker TMEM119. These gradients were greatest in TLS+ cases and were associated with: Early age at onset and at death; increased CSF levels of Nf-L, chitinase-3-L1, sTNFR1, TNF, CCL19, CCL21, CCL22, CXCL10, CXCL13, IFNgamma, sCD163, fibrinogen, IL2, and IL10; perivascular sub-ependymal infiltrates containing abundant CD20+B cells, CD3+T cells, plasma cells, scattered CD35+follicular-dendritic cells and CXCL13.

3596,"Normal intima-media thickness on carotid ultrasound reliably excludes an ischemic cause of cardiomyopathy BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Patients with ischemia as the cause of LVSD may warrant revascularization. Angiography is the most accurate method of CAD diagnosis but is invasive, expensive, and associated with some risk. Noninvasive imaging for CAD often involves expensive equipment, radiation exposure, medication, and/or contrast administration. Carotid ultrasound with measurement of intima-media thickness (IMT) is safe and inexpensive. Carotid IMT is well correlated with the presence of CAD. We assessed the accuracy of carotid ultrasound for identification of CAD as a potential etiology of LVSD.METHODS: Patients with LVSD (ejection fraction < or =40%) of uncertain etiology referred for angiography underwent carotid ultrasound. Patients with history of myocardial infarction were excluded. Two experienced cardiologists blinded to CAD status determined common carotid artery (CCA) IMT and plaque. Significant CAD was defined as > or =50% stenosis of any major artery. Ischemic LVSD was defined as (1) left main and/or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery > or =75% or (2) > or =2 major arteries with > or =75% stenosis.RESULTS: Mean ejection fraction was 27% +/- 10% in 150 patients. Significant CAD was found in 64 (42.7%) and ischemic LVSD in 40 (26.7%). Carotid plaque was seen in 95 (63.3%). Mean CCA IMT was > or =0.9 mm in 69 (46.0%). The combination of mean CCA IMT <0.9 mm and no plaque had negative predictive value for ischemic LVSD of 98%.CONCLUSIONS: Carotid ultrasound with IMT measurement is a valuable screening tool for excluding an ischemic etiology of LVSD when CAD is suspected.",Excluded
3265,"Time resolved dosimetry of human brain exposed to low frequency pulsed magnetic fields An accurate dosimetry is a key issue to understanding brain stimulation and related interaction mechanisms with neuronal tissues at the basis of the increasing amount of literature revealing the effects on human brain induced by low-level, low frequency pulsed magnetic fields (PMFs). Most literature on brain dosimetry estimates the maximum E field value reached inside the tissue without considering its time pattern or tissue dispersivity. Nevertheless a time-resolved dosimetry, accounting for dispersive tissues behavior, becomes necessary considering that the threshold for an effect onset may vary depending on the pulse waveform and that tissues may filter the applied stimulatory fields altering the predicted stimulatory waveform's size and shape. In this paper a time-resolved dosimetry has been applied on a realistic brain model exposed to the signal presented in Capone et al (2009 J. Neural Transm. 116 257-65), accounting for the broadband dispersivity of brain tissues up to several kHz, to accurately reconstruct electric field and current density waveforms inside different brain tissues. The results obtained by exposing the Duke's brain model to this PMF signal show that the E peak in the brain is considerably underestimated if a simple monochromatic dosimetry is carried out at the pulse repetition frequency of 75 Hz.",Excluded
2964,"The degree of radiation-induced DNA strand breaks is altered by acute sleep deprivation and psychological stress and is associated with cognitive performance in humans Study Objectives: Sleep deprivation is associated with impaired immune responses, cancer, and morbidity and mortality, and can degrade cognitive performance, although individual differences exist in such responses. Sleep deprivation induces DNA strand breaks and DNA base oxidation in animals, and psychological stress is associated with increased DNA damage in humans. It remains unknown whether sleep deprivation or psychological stress in humans affects DNA damage response from environmental stressors, and whether these responses predict cognitive performance during sleep deprivation.Methods: Sixteen healthy adults (ages 29-52 years; mean age +/- SD, 36.4 +/- 7.1 years; seven women) participated in a 5-day experiment involving two 8 hr time-in-bed (TIB) baseline nights, followed by 39 hr total sleep deprivation (TSD), and two 8-10 hr TIB recovery nights. A modified Trier Social Stress Test was conducted on the day after TSD. The Psychomotor Vigilance Test measured behavioral attention. DNA damage was assessed in blood cells collected at 5 time points, and blood cells were irradiated ex vivo.Results: TSD, alone or in combination with psychological stress, did not induce significant increases in DNA damage. By contrast, radiation-induced DNA damage decreased significantly in response to TSD, but increased back to baseline when combined with psychological stress. Cognitively vulnerable individuals had more radiation-induced DNA strand breaks before TSD, indicating their greater sensitivity to DNA damage from environmental stressors.Conclusions: Our results provide novel insights into the molecular consequences of sleep deprivation, psychological stress, and performance vulnerability. They are important for fields involving sleep loss, radiation exposure, and cognitive deficits, including cancer therapy, environmental toxicology, and space medicine.",Excluded

3555,"Color coded maps of white matter tracts: No need for tractography BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: White matter tracts can be observed using tractograms generated from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, the dependence of these tract images on subjective variables, including how seed points are placed and the preferred level of fractional anisotropy, introduces interobserver inconsistency and potential lack of reliability. We propose that color coded maps (CCM) generated from DTI can be a preferred method for the visualization of important white matter tracts. METHOD(S): DTI was acquired in 25 patients with brain tumors. Lesions included 15 tumors of glial origin, 9 metastatic tumors, two meningiomas, and one cavernous angioma. Tractograms of the pyramidal and/or optic radiations, based on tumor location, were created by marking seed regions of interest using known anatomical locations. We compared the degree of tract involvement and white matter alteration between CCMs and tractograms. Neurological outcomes were obtained from chart reviews. RESULT(S): The pyramidal tract was evaluated in 20/25 patients, the visual tracts were evaluated in 10/25, and both tracts were evaluated in 5/25. In 19/25 studies, the same patterns of white matter alternations were found between the CCM and tractograms. In the 6 patients where patterns differed, 2 tractograms were not useful in determining pattern alteration; in the remaining 4/6, no practical difference was seen in comparing the studies. Two patients were lost to follow up. Thirteen patients were neurologically improved or remained intact after intervention. In these, 10 of the 13 patients showed displaced white matter tracts on CCM. Twelve patients had no improvement of their preoperative deficit. In 9 of these 12 patients, CCM showed white matter disruption. CONCLUSION(S): CCMs provide a convenient, practical, and objective method of visualizing white matter tracts, obviating the need for potentially subjective and time-consuming tractography. CCMs are at least as reliable as tractograms in predicting neurological outcomes after neurosurgical intervention.",Excluded

Purpose To evaluate diagnostic performance of a reduced-dose 100 kVp CT protocol with advanced modeled iterative reconstruction as compared to a linearly blended 120 kVp protocol for assessment of acute, non-traumatic abdominal pain. Material and Methods Two radiologists assessed 100 kVp and linearly blended 120 kVp series of 112 consecutive patients with acute non-traumatic pain (onset < 48 h) regarding image quality, noise, and artifacts on a five-point Likert scale. Both radiologists assessed both series for abdominal pathologies and for diagnostic confidence. Both 100 kVp and linearly blended 120 kVp series were quantitatively evaluated regarding radiation dose and image noise. Comparative statistics and diagnostic accuracy was calculated using receiver operating curve (ROC) statistics, with final clinical diagnosis/clinical follow-up as reference standard. Results Image quality was high for both series without detectable significant differences ( P = 0.157). Image noise and artifacts were rated low for both series but significantly higher for 100 kVp ( P <= 0.021). Diagnostic accuracy was high for both series (120 kVp: area under the curve [AUC] = 0.950, sensitivity = 0.958, specificity = 0.941; 100 kVp: AUC >= 0.910, sensitivity >= 0.937, specificity = 0.882; P >= 0.516) with almost perfect inter-rater agreement (Kappa = 0.939). Diagnostic confidence was high for both dose levels without significant differences (100 kVp 5, range 4-5; 120 kVp 5, range 3-5; P = 0.134). The 100 kVp series yielded 26.1% lower radiation dose compared with the 120 kVp series (5.72 +/- 2.23 mSv versus 7.75 +/- 3.02 mSv, P < 0.001). Image noise was significantly higher in reduced-dose CT (13.3 +/- 2.4 HU versus 10.6 +/- 2.1 HU; P < 0.001). Conclusion Reduced-dose abdominal CT using 100 kVp yields excellent image quality and high diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of acute non-traumatic abdominal pain.",Excluded
2584,"Field dependence study of in vivo brain (31) P MRS up to 16.4 T In vivo (31) P MRS provides a unique tool for studying bioenergetics of living organs. Although its utility has been limited by the relatively low (31) P NMR sensitivity, increasing magnetic field strength (B0 ) could significantly improve the quality and reliability of the (31) P MR spectra for biomedical research. To quantitatively understand the field dependence of in vivo (31) P MRS for brain applications, (31) P NMR sensitivity of phosphocreatine (PCr) in rat brains was measured and compared at 9.4 T and 16.4 T. Additionally, the linewidths and T1 relaxation times of PCr and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) resonances obtained from human and animal brains over a wide B0 range from 4 T, 7 T, and 9.4 T to 16.4 T were examined and their field dependences were quantified. The results indicate an approximate 1.74-fold (31) P signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain for PCr at 16.4 T compared with 9.4 T. An approximate power 1.4 dependence of (31) P SNR on B0 was concluded. Substantial improvements in spectral resolution and significantly shortened T1 values of brain PCr and ATP were observed at high/ultrahigh fields, contributing to an additional sensitivity gain and spectral improvement. In summary, the overall findings from this study suggest that in vivo (31) P MRS should greatly benefit from high/ultrahigh fields for noninvasive assessment of altered bioenergetics and metabolic processes associated with brain function and neurological diseases.",Excluded
3613,"Effects of Preoperative Simulation on Minimally Invasive Hybrid Lumbar Interbody Fusion OBJECTIVE: The main focus of this study was to evaluate how preoperative simulation affects the surgical work flow, radiation exposure, and outcome of minimally invasive hybrid lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-HLIF).METHODS: A total of 132 patients who underwent single-level MIS-HLIF were enrolled in a cohort study design. Dose area product was analyzed in addition to surgical data. Once preoperative simulation was established, 66 cases (SIM cohort) were compared with 66 patients who had previously undergone MIS-HLIF without preoperative simulation (NO-SIM cohort).RESULTS: Dose area product was reduced considerably in the SIM cohort (320 cGy.cm<sup>2</sup> NO-SIM cohort: 470 cGy.cm<sup>2</sup>; P < 0.01). Surgical time was shorter for the SIM cohort (155 minutes; NO-SIM cohort, 182 minutes; P < 0.05). SIM cohort had a better outcome in Numeric Rating Scale back at 6 months follow-up compared with the NO-SIM cohort (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative simulation reduced radiation exposure and resulted in less back pain at the 6 months follow-up time point. Preoperative simulation provided guidance in determining the correct cage height. Outcome controls enabled the surgeon to improve the procedure and the software algorithm.",Excluded
3577,"810nm near-infrared light offers neuroprotection and improves locomotor activity in MPTP-treated mice We explored whether 810nm near-infrared light (NIr) offered neuroprotection and/or improvement in locomotor activity in an acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Mice received MPTP and 810nm NIr treatments, or not, and were tested for locomotive activity in an open-field test. Thereafter, brains were aldehyde-fixed and processed for tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that MPTP-treated mice that were irradiated with 810nm NIr had both greater locomotor activity (~40%) and number of dopaminergic cells (~20%) than those that were not. In summary, 810nm (as with 670nm) NIr offered neuroprotection and improved locomotor activity in MPTP-treated mice.",Excluded
3153,"Does iterative reconstruction lower CT radiation dose: evaluation of 15,000 examinations PURPOSE: Evaluation of 15,000 computed tomography (CT) examinations to investigate if iterative reconstruction (IR) reduces sustainably radiation exposure.METHOD AND MATERIALS: Information from 15,000 CT examinations was collected, including all aspects of the exams such as scan parameter, patient information, and reconstruction instructions. The examinations were acquired between January 2010 and December 2012, while after 15 months a first generation IR algorithm was installed. To collect the necessary information from PACS, RIS, MPPS and structured reports a Dose Monitoring System was developed. To harvest all possible information an optical character recognition system was integrated, for example to collect information from the screenshot CT-dose report. The tool transfers all data to a database for further processing such as the calculation of effective dose and organ doses. To evaluate if IR provides a sustainable dose reduction, the effective dose values were statistically analyzed with respect to protocol type, diagnostic indication, and patient population.RESULTS: IR has the potential to reduce radiation dose significantly. Before clinical introduction of IR the average effective dose was 10.1+/-7.8mSv and with IR 8.9+/-7.1mSv (p*=0.01). Especially in CTA, with the possibility to use kV reduction protocols, such as in aortic CTAs (before IR: average14.2+/-7.8mSv; median11.4mSv /with IR:average9.9+/-7.4mSv; median7.4mSv), or pulmonary CTAs (before IR: average9.7+/-6.2mSV; median7.7mSv /with IR: average6.4+/-4.7mSv; median4.8mSv) the dose reduction effect is significant(p*=0.01). On the contrary for unenhanced low-dose scans of the cranial (for example sinuses) the reduction is not significant (before IR:average6.6+/-5.8mSv; median3.9mSv/with IR:average6.0+/-3.1mSV; median3.2mSv).CONCLUSION: The dose aspect remains a priority in CT research. Iterative reconstruction algorithms reduce sustainably and significantly radiation dose in the clinical routine. Our results illustrate that not only in studies with a limited number of patients but also in the clinical routine, IRs provide long-term dose saving.",Excluded
3429,"[Rules of application and mode of action of transcranial direct current stimulation in neurorehabilitation: primary motor cortex] Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging technique of non-invasive brain stimulation that has been found useful in facilitating treatment of various neurological disorders, especially stroke. Currently available criteria for single application of several minutes-long stimulation at 1-2 mA have been considered safe. However, knowledge regarding safety parameters of repeated and long-term electrical stimulation is so far limited. Studies on the use of tDCS focus predominantly on the motor cortex. They demonstrate that weak direct current is capable of eliciting cortical excitability changes which occur during and after stimulation. The nature of these changes is specific for current polarity - anodal stimulation enhances excitability, and cathodal reduces it. Studies indicate that tDCS effects are generated by polarity-driven alterations of membrane potentials and efficacy modulations of specific neuronal receptors. According to interhemispheric competition models, possible mechanisms underlying functional improvements due to stimulation in patients with stroke are attributed to tDCS-induced modification of inappropriate interhemispheric inhibition.

3009,"Sparing of tissue by using micro-slit-beam radiation therapy reduces neurotoxicity compared with broad-beam radiation therapy Micro-slit-beam radiation therapy (MRT) using synchrotron-generated X-ray beams allows for extremely high-dose irradiation. However, the toxicity of MRT in central nervous system (CNS) use is still unknown. To gather baseline toxicological data, we evaluated mortality in normal mice following CNS-targeted MRT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Synchrotron X-ray-beam radiation was provided by the SPring-8 BL28B2 beam-line. For MRT, radiation was delivered to groups of mice in a 10 x 12 mm unidirectional array consisting of 25-mum-wide beams spaced 100, 200 or 300 mum apart; another group of mice received the equivalent broad-beam radiation therapy (BRT) for comparison. Peak and valley dose rates of the MRT were 120 and 0.7 Gy/s, respectively. Delivered doses were 96-960 Gy for MRT, and 24-120 Gy for BRT. Mortality was monitored for 90 days post-irradiation. Brain tissue was stained using hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate neural structure. Demyelination was evaluated by Kluver-Barrera staining. The LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>100</sub> when using MRT were 600 Gy and 720 Gy, respectively, and when using BRT they were 80 Gy and 96 Gy, respectively. In MRT, mortality decreased as the center-to-center beam spacing increased from 100 mum to 300 mum. Cortical architecture was well preserved in MRT, whereas BRT induced various degrees of cerebral hemorrhage and demyelination. MRT was able to deliver extremely high doses of radiation, while still minimizing neuronal death. The valley doses, influenced by beam spacing and irradiated dose, could represent important survival factors for MRT.",Included
2933,"Relationship between volume, dose and local control in stereotactic radiosurgery of brain metastasis The aim of this study is to analyse the efficacy of linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on prognostic factors, local control rate and survival in patients with brain metastasis. Patients with either a single metastasis or up to 4 multiple brain metastases with a maximum tumour diameter of 40 mm for each tumour and a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) > or = 70 were eligible for SRS. SRS was applied to 150 lesions in 86 consecutive patients with a median age of 60 years (median 1 and mean 1.7 lesions per patient, mean KPS 86). Median overall survival was 6.2 months after SRS and 9.7 months from diagnosis of brain metastasis. Multivariate analysis revealed that a KPS of 90 or more (p = 0.009) and female sex (p = 0.003) were associated with a longer survival. Radiation dose < or = 15 Gy (p = 0.017) and KPS < 90 (p = 0.013) were independent predictors of a shorter time to local failure. Five patients showed evidence of radionecrosis with a median survival of 14.8 months. Addition of WBRT neither led to improvement of survival nor to improvement of local control. Improved local control following SRS for brain metastases was associated with KPS > or =90, a radiation dose > 15 Gy and a PTV < 13 cc.

3588,"A novel specific application of pyruvate protects the mouse retina against white light damage: differential stabilization of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha PURPOSE: To mimic hypoxia preconditioning by a novel specific pyruvate treatment and to study its retinal protection against white light damage.METHODS: Six-to-eight-week-old BALB/c mice were exposed to strong white light calculated to produce photoreceptor degeneration. Some were given injections of pyruvate in a preordained protocol because evidence exists that proves pyruvate can affect the concentration of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to determine the concentration of proteins and mRNAs in retinas. Morphology was analyzed with toluidine blue staining and was plotted using a spidergraph. A free nucleosome cell death assay was used to examine apoptosis. Retina explant cultures were used to investigate the background mechanism.RESULTS: Pyruvate administration stabilized hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha. Expression of the downstream genes hemoxygenase-1 and erythropoietin mirrored the changes of the two HIFs, respectively. Importantly, pyruvate given not only before but also after exposure to light protected photoreceptors against apoptosis. In the retinal explant system, addition or depletion of pyruvate caused only changes of HIF-1alpha and prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)-2, while HIF-2alpha and PHD1 were not affected. However, under hypoxic conditions, HIF-2alpha was stabilized by pyruvate but not HIF-1alpha.CONCLUSIONS: Pyruvate evoked a hypoxia-like response under normoxic conditions and was retina-protective against strong white light. This response included stabilization of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha. This differential stabilization might be related to the distinct preference of their degrading enzyme of PHD2 and PHD1 in response to pyruvate treatment.",Excluded
3452,"Indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and its application In mitochondria, ATP synthesis is coupled to oxygen consumption by the proton electrochemical gradient established across the mitochondrial inner membrane in a process termed oxidative phosphorylation. It has long been known from stoichiometric studies that ATP synthesis is not perfectly coupled to oxygen consumption. The major inefficiency in the system is leakage of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane driven by the proton electrochemical gradient. The kinetics of the proton leak can be determined indirectly, by measuring the oxygen consumption of mitochondria under non-phosphorylating conditions (plus oligomycin) as a function of the proton electrochemical gradient. This experimental system provides a convenient means to investigate inner membrane permeability to protons and the effect of factors that may effect that permeability. In this paper we review some results from our laboratory of indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and how it has been applied to investigate the effect of aging, obesity and thyroid status on proton leak. The results show that (i) proton leak in isolated liver mitochondria is not significantly different in a comparison of young and old rats, in contrast (ii) there is an apparent increase in proton leak in in situ mitochondria in hepatocytes from old rats when compared to those from young rats, (iii) proton leak in neuronal mitochondria in situ in synaptosomes is not significantly different in young and old rats, (iv) proton leak is greater in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice compared to lean controls, (v) acute leptin (OB protein) administration restores the increased leak rate in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice to that of lean controls, (vi) administration of thyroid hormone (T3) increases proton leak in rat muscle mitochondria, and (vii) proton leak in muscle mitochondria is insensitive to the presence of GDP. It is proposed that the experimental system described here for measuring proton leak, is an ideal functional assay for determining whether the novel uncoupling proteins increase inner membrane permeability to protons.",Excluded

We measured both, visual acuity and glare due to forward light scatter using a computer system.RESULTS: Following treatment both groups had equally significant (< 0.001) improvements in visual acuity. However, a significant (p < 0.001) improvement of glare due to forward light scatter was only observed in the eyes with a large size capsulotomy.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that measurements of forward light scatter are more sensitive than visual acuity testing in demonstrating loss of visual performance in patients with media opacities. It is recommended that pupils are dilated prior to Nd:YAG capsulotomy if forward light scatter from capsule remnants and the subsequent glare disability are to be minimised.",Excluded

Thus, the neurologic outcome of radiosurgery in brain metastasis (BM) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was reviewed. We analyzed 135 patients with BM of NSCLC who were administered Cyberknife radiosurgery (CKRS) as either initial or salvage therapy. We evaluated local failure (LF), intracranial failure (IF), and neurological death (ND) due to BM. Primary outcome was neurological death-free survival (NDFS). Median follow-up was 16.2 months. Median CKRS dose of 22 Gy was administered to median 2 targets per patient. Among 99 deaths, 14 (14%) were ND. Upfront treatment for BM included CKRS alone in 85 patients (63%), CKRS + TA in 26 patients (19%), and WBRT in 24 patients (18%). No patients or tumor related factors were associated with ND. However, the type of upfront treatment for BM was significantly associated with ND [HR 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.57) for CKRS + TA, HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.19-1.68) for CKRS alone] compared with the WBRT group (P = 0.01). The 2-year NDFS rates for the CKRS + TA, CRKS alone, and WBRT groups were 94%, 87%, and 78%, respectively (P = 0.03). Upfront CKRS showed significantly higher 2-year LF-free survival rate (P < 0.01). IF rate was insignificantly lower in the WBRT group compared with CKRS group (P = 0.38). Upfront CKRS + TA was associated with the best neurological outcome with high NDFS.

3196,"Evaluation of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other tremors: Survival of neurons adjacent to the thalamic lesion after gamma thalamotomy Object. The effects of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other kinds of tremor were evaluated. Methods. Thirty-six thalamotomies were performed in 31 patients by using a 4-mm collimator. The maximum dose was 150 Gy in the initial six cases, which was reduced to 130 Gy thereafter. The longest follow-up period was 6 years. The target was determined on T<inf>2</inf>-weighted and proton magnetic resonance (MR) images. The point chosen was in the lateral-most part of the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus. This is in keeping with open thalamotomy as practiced at the authors' institution. In 15 cases, gamma thalamotomy was the first surgical procedure. In other cases, previous therapeutic or vascular lesions were visible to facilitate targeting. Two types of tissue reaction were onserved on MR imaging: a simple oval shape and a complex irregular shape. Neither of these changes affected the clinical course. In the majority of cases, the tremor subsided after a latent interval of approximately 1 year after irradiation. The earliest response was demonstrated at 3 months. In five cases the tremor remained. In four of these cases, a second radiation session was administered. One of these four patients as well as another patient with an unsatisfactory result underwent open thalamotomy with microrecording. In both cases, depth recording adjacent to the necrotic area revealed normal neuronal activity, including the rhythmic discharge of tremor. Minor coagulation was performed and resulted in immediate and complete arrest of the remaining tremor. Conclusions. Gamma thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease seems to be an alternative useful method in selected cases.",Excluded

Susceptible subjects fail to generate an adequate adrenergic response to upright posture. The alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, midodrine, may be an effective countermeasure. We tested the hypothesis that midodrine would have no negative hemodynamic effect on healthy astronauts returning from space.METHODS: Five male astronauts participated in preflight and post-flight tilt testing on a control flight as well as on the test flights, where midodrine (10 mg, orally) was administered after landing approximately 1 h before testing.RESULTS: None of these astronauts exhibited orthostatic hypotension or presyncope before or after either flight. Midodrine did not cause any untoward reactions in these subjects before or after flight; in fact, a modest beneficial effect was seen on postflight tachycardia (p = 0.036).DISCUSSION: These data show that midodrine protected against post-spaceflight increases in heart rate without having any adverse hemodynamic effects on non-presyncopal, male astronauts.

3528,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for medically refractory multiple sclerosis-related tremor OBJECTIVE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that can lead to severe intention tremor in some patients. In several case reports, conventional radiotherapy has been reported to possibly exacerbate MS. Radiosurgery dramatically limits normal tissue irradiation to potentially avoid such a problem. Gamma Knife thalamotomy (GKT) has been established as a minimally invasive technique that is effective in treating essential tremor and Parkinson's disease-related tremor. The goal in this study was to analyze the outcomes of GKT in patients suffering from medically refractory MS-related tremor. METHODS The authors retrospectively studied the outcomes of 15 patients (mean age 46.5 years) who had undergone GKT over a 15-year period (1998-2012). Fourteen patients underwent GKT at a median maximum dose of 140 Gy (range 130-150 Gy) using a single 4-mm isocenter. One patient underwent GKT at a dose of 140 Gy delivered via two 4-mm isocenters (3 mm apart). The posteroinferior region of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (VIM) was the target for all GKTs. The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale was used to evaluate tremor, handwriting, drawing, and drinking. The median time to the last follow-up was 39 months. RESULTS After GKT, 13 patients experienced tremor improvement on the side contralateral to surgery. Four patients noted tremor arrest at a median of 4.5 months post-GKT. Seven patients had excellent tremor improvement and 6 had good tremor improvement. Four patients noted excellent functional improvement, 8 noted good functional improvement, and 1 noted satisfactory functional improvement. Three patients experienced diminished tremor relief at a median of 18 months after radiosurgery. Two patients experienced temporary adverse radiation effects. Another patient developed a large thalamic cyst 60 months after GKT, which was successfully managed with Ommaya reservoir placement.

Each tumor was complex in shape and adherent to, or encompassed, organs at risk (cranial nerves, optic apparatus, and brainstem). All patients, immobilized in a customized head mask integrated into a stereotactic system, were planned on an inverse treatment planning system using 5 or 7 coplanar, equidistant beams and 5 intensity steps. Each treatment plan was verified extensively before treatment. Follow-up with MRI and clinical examination was performed at 6 and 18 weeks and every 6 months thereafter.RESULTS: Target volumes ranged from 27 to 278 cc (median: 108 cc). Mean dose in 32 fractions ranged between 55.8 and 58.2 Gy. At median follow-up of 36 months (range: 31-43 months), pre-existing neurologic symptoms improved in 12/20 (60%), remained stable in 7/20 (35%), and worsened in 1 (5%) patient. Radiographic follow-up revealed significant tumor shrinkage 6 weeks post-IMRT in 2 patients and partial remission in 3 more patients at 9-17 months; other tumor volumes remained stable. There was no radiation-induced peritumoral edema, increase in tumor size, or new onset of neurologic deficits. Transient acute treatment side effects included nausea and vomiting and single occurrences of conjunctivitis/increased tearing and serous tympanitis.CONCLUSION: IMRT in the treatment of central nervous system meningiomas is feasible and safe, offering highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped skull-base tumors while sparing adjacent critical structures. If the tumor remissions seen here are found in the ongoing treatments, IMRT may be considered the treatment of choice for inoperable or subtotally resected meningiomas and for otherwise difficult-to-treat, complex-shaped tumors of the central nervous system adjacent to critical structures, with the potential of dose escalation for malignant tumors.",Excluded

The duration of the low night-time levels was clearly proportional to the length of the dark phase. A marked rhythm of melatonin synthesis was also seen with low daytime levels and high night-time values. An inverse relationship between 5-MT and melatonin levels was observed.

Prescription dose was 45 Gy. Target volumes were: gross tumor volume (GTV) = macroadenoma, clinical target volume (CTV) = GTV, and planning target volume = CTV + 0.5 cm. Structure contouring was performed by two radiation oncologists guided by an expert neuroradiologist.RESULTS: Five-field IMRT yielded significantly decreased temporal lobe dose delivery compared with 3D-CRT and 3F IMRT. Temporal lobe sparing with 5F IMRT was most pronounced at intermediate doses: mean V25Gy (% of total temporal lobe volume receiving >=25 Gy) of 13% vs. 28% vs. 29% for right temporal lobe and 14% vs. 29% vs. 30% for left temporal lobe for 5F IMRT, 3D-CRT, and 3F IMRT, respectively (p < 10(-7) for 5F IMRT vs. 3D-CRT and 5F IMRT vs. 3F IMRT). Five-field IMRT plans did not compromise target coverage, exceed normal tissue dose constraints, or increase estimated brain integral dose.CONCLUSIONS: Five-field IMRT irradiation technique results in a statistically significant decrease in the dose to the temporal lobes and may thus help prevent neurocognitive sequelae in irradiated pituitary macroadenoma patients.",Excluded
2653,"The efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy for metastases from renal cell carcinoma Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for intracranial and extracranial metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma. The retrospective analysis of 85 patients (151 tumors) treated with SRT was performed. SRT was the sole treatment in 35% of tumors, the other 65% had received additional treatment such as surgery, palliative radiotherapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy. In 60% and 40% of patients SRT was delivered to brain and extracranial lesions, respectively. The assessment of the efficacy of SRT was based on a radiological imaging (Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and estimation of Local Control (LC) as well as Overall Survival (OS). Single fraction was used for 104 tumors and fractionated treatment for 47 tumors. The crude LC for evaluable lesions was 81%, stratified by tumor location: brain LC=94%, extracranial tumors LC=70% (p=0.049). The median OS was 9.4 months; 1-year and 2-year OS were 40% and 29%, respectively. The additional treatment did not lead to a better local response (p=0,543), but resulted in a benefit in OS (7 vs 13 months, p=0,01). A positive relationship between the biologically effective dose (BED) and local response was noted, but the BED was influenced by a tumor volume (R=-0,38; p<0,00001). The presence of multi-organ metastases reduced the OS rate (8.7 vs 19.1 months; p=0,01). The interval between the diagnosis of the metastasis and its treatment with SRT was inversely related to OS (P=0.0001). SRT results in a good local response, which is more beneficial for brain than extracranial lesions. The local efficacy of the SRT depends on the radiation dose. Multidisciplinary treatment and earlier application of SRT improves the prognosis of patients. Copyright © 2016, Cancer Research Institute Slovak Acad. of Sciences. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Here, an entity in the CXR image can help determine if the patient (whose CXR is used) is suffering from pneumonia or not. A simple model of capsules (also known as Simple CapsNet) has provided results comparable to best Deep Learning models that had been used earlier. Subsequently, a combination of convolutions and capsules is used to obtain two models that outperform all models previously proposed. These models-Integration of convolutions with capsules (ICC) and Ensemble of convolutions with capsules (ECC)-detect pneumonia with a test accuracy of 95.33% and 95.90%, respectively. The latter model is studied in detail to obtain a variant called EnCC, where n = 3, 4, 8, 16. Here, the E4CC model works optimally and gives test accuracy of 96.36%. All these models had been trained, validated, and tested on 5857 images from Mendeley.",Excluded

Advancements in the management of SCLC have lagged behind those seen for non-small cell lung cancers. As the era of precision medicine and targeted immunotherapy evolves, radiologists must be familiar with the modern treatment paradigms of SCLC and associated imaging patterns, including classic and nonclassic appearances of treatment complications.

2863,"Palliative radiation for spinal metastases: Does the presence of soft tissue disease affect the choice of treatment dose and fractionation? Purpose/Objective(s): Spinal bone metastases associated with soft tissue disease (ST) are frequently considered at higher risk of developing further complications such as neuropathic pain and cord compression. The objectives of our study were to describe the prevalence of ST in patients presenting for spine radiation therapy (XRT), and whether presence of soft tissue disease is associated with a difference in treatment approach compared with those whose do not (nST). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of all consecutive patients receiving spine XRT within our palliative radiation program during 2012. Patient demographics, symptoms intensity, performance status and life expectancy were captured at the time of consultation. Diagnostic imaging including CT +/- MRI as well as planning CT relevant to the course of treatment were reviewed to document whether ST, cord compression (CC) or compression fracture (CF) was present at the levels being irradiated. Whether a field based or volume based approach was employed by the radiation oncologist to define the treatment plan was recorded. Binary logistic regression was used for inferences, using the generalized estimating equation approach to adjust the standard error to account for the correlation of observations within a patient. Result(s): One hundred fifty patients receiving 177 treatments were reviewed. This included 19 patients receiving simultaneous treatment to 2 separate sites and 4 patients receiving treatment to 3 sites. The mean age was 64 years. 71% (106/150) of patients in both groups were estimated to have a life expectancy of over 6 months. Fifty-five percent of treatments given were in the lumbosacral area. Nocomplicating radiological features (i.e., noST, CC, CF) was present in 89/177 (50%) of cases. ST was present in 50/177 cases [28% [95% CI 25-32%)]. Of these,32%(16/50) also had aCCand 32%(16/50) had aCF. There were no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex distribution and source of primary. The proportion of patients with severe pain (>5 on a scale of 0-10) was 46% ST and 60% nST (p = 0.82). Volume based planning was employed for 58% ST and 48% nST. Fractionated treatments (mostly 20 Gy/ 5 fractions) were employed in 84% ST and 66% nST of cases. After adjustment for CC and CF, there was a trend to suggest physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated treatments in cases with ST (p =0.16). Conclusion(s): Fifty percent of treatment courses delivered to spine were associated with some complicating radiological features including ST, SC or CF. ST was present in 28% cases. We were unable to identify any clinical features that would predict for the presence of ST disease. There is a trend that physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated radiation therapy when ST was present.",Excluded

3017,"Neoadjuvant versus definitive chemoradiation in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus BACKGROUND: Multimodal treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery (nCRT + S) is the treatment of choice for patients with locally advanced or node-positive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (E-SCC). Those who are unsuitable or who decline surgery can be treated with definitive chemoradiation (dCRT). This study compares the oncologic outcome of nCRT + S and dCRT in E-SCC patients.METHODS: Between 2011 and 2017, 95 patients with E-SCC were scheduled for dCRT or nCRT+ S with IMRT at our department. Patients undergoing dCRT received at least 50 Gy and those undergoing nCRT + S received at least 41.4 Gy. All patients received simultaneous chemotherapy with either carboplatin and paclitaxel or cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil. We retrospectively compared baseline characteristics and oncologic outcome including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and site of failure between both treatment groups.RESULTS: Patients undergoing dCRT were less likely to have clinically suspected lymph node metastases (85% vs. 100%, p = 0.019) than patients undergoing nCRT + S and had more proximally located tumors (median distance from dental arch to cranial tumor border 20 cm vs. 26 cm, p < 0.001). After a median follow up of 25.6 months for surviving patients, no significant differences for OS and PFS were noticed comparing nCRT + S and dCRT. However, the rate of local tumor recurrence was significantly higher in patients treated with dCRT than in those treated with nCRT + S (38% vs. 10%, p = 0.002). Within a multivariate Cox regression model, age, tumor location, and tumor grading were the only independent parameters affecting OS and PFS. In addition to that, proximal tumor location was the only parameter independently associated with an increased risk for local treatment failure.CONCLUSION: In E-SCC patients treated with either dCRT or nCRT + S, a higher rate of local tumor recurrence was seen in patients treated with dCRT than in patients treated with nCRT + S. There was at least a trend towards an improved OS and PFS in patients undergoing nCRT + S. However, this should be interpreted with caution, because proximal tumor location was the only parameter independently affecting the risk of local tumor recurrence.",Excluded

ON included optic neuritis (NNO) and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). For each subject, the PLR was recorded, to red, yellow, green, and blue stimuli for durations of 4 and 12 s, and for stimulus intensities of 4 lx and 28 lx.RESULTS: Comparison between control and RP or ON patient results showed that responses after stimulus onset were significantly different for most stimulus conditions, but the post-stimulus amplitudes at 3 s and 7 s after light extinction were not. On the other hand, the difference between the ON and RP groups was significant only for post-stimuli time-points and only for blue stimuli. Differences between responses to blue and red were significantly different, predominantly at post stimulus time-points. A ROC analysis revealed that the maximal constriction amplitudes to a 4 lx, 4 s yellow stimulus are significantly different in ON vs RP patients, and the responses to a 4 s, 28 lx blue stimulus at 7 s post-stimulus are significantly different in controls vs ON vs RP patients with a high specificity.CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary light responses to blue light in healthy, RP, and ON subjects are significantly different from one another.

As compared to control, non-stimulated rats, 21 but not 10 hippocampal ADs resulted in a decrease in social contact, an increase in social isolation, and an increase in climbing and chasing behavior tested in an open field 3 days after cessation of kindling. Porsolt forced swimming test was not different among the control, 10- or 21-AD groups of rats. A deficit in sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition of an acoustic startle, was observed in kindled as compared to control rats at 2 weeks after 21 ADs, but not after 10 ADs. Similarly, methamphetamine (1 mg/kg i.p.) induced higher locomotor activity in kindled rats, as compared to controls, after 21 ADs but not after 10 ADs. Spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel cage, without drug administration, was not different between kindled and control rats.

2953,"Regulation of prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> synthesis after brain irradiation Purpose: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> (PGE <inf>2</inf>) levels seen after radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE <inf>2</inf> production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE<inf>2</inf> production and PGES expression. Result(s): As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE<inf>2</inf> levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE<inf>2</inf> seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls. Conclusion(s): Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE<inf>2</inf> production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",Included
2919,"Benign central neurocytoma: A double misnomer? BACKGROUND. 'Central neurocytoma' is classically considered as an intraventricular benign tumor, largely based on data from small retrospective series. The authors present prospective data on 12 patients with tumors diagnosed as central neurocytoma, to highlight the diverse nature of this tumor and challenge the classic notion. METHODS. Between 1991 and 1997, 12 patients had tumors diagnosed prospectively as 'central neurocytoma'. Clinical, radiologic, and histologic data were collected, and Karnofsky performance score was evaluated for each patient. Proliferation marker studies were performed using Ki-67 labeling index. RESULTS. In two patients, the tumors were located in atypical locations, namely, the parietal lobe and the spine. Aggressive behavior characterized by clinical and radiologic evidence of tumor progression was noted in two additional patients. In both these cases, unusually high proliferation rates of 5.3% and 11.2% were noted. Total excision of the tumor, when possible, was the treatment of choice. Postoperative radiotherapy to the residual tumor may be of benefit in patients with clinically aggressive tumors, or those with high proliferation rates. CONCLUSIONS. Given the findings of this study; it is suggested that the traditional concept of central neurocytoma as a benign intraventricular tumor warrants reconsideration.

3472,"Targeted sequencing and intracranial outcomes of patients with lung adenocarcinoma brain metastases treated with radiotherapy BACKGROUND: Treatment for advanced lung adenocarcinoma (AC) has become increasingly personalized based on molecular results. However, for patients with AC brain metastases (BMs), intracranial outcomes based on molecular subtype and the frequency of molecular aberrations are less well defined. This study sought to report targeted next-generation sequencing results and investigate molecularly based outcomes for patients with AC-BMs treated with radiotherapy.METHODS: The records of 132 patients with AC-BMs treated at Emory University from September 2008 to August 2016 with successful next-generation sequencing were reviewed. Rates of local disease recurrence, distant brain failure (DBF), and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were estimated using cumulative incidence with competing risk analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.RESULTS: The most common aberrations included tumor protein 53 (TP53) (60%), KRAS (29%), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (20.5%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss (15.5%), and MET amplification (13%). The majority of patients (62%) were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery alone. In these patients, KRAS mutation, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, and having >= 6 BMs were associated with an increased risk of salvage WBRT (P < .05). KRAS mutation remained significant for an increased risk of salvage WBRT when compared with EGFR/ALK/KRAS-negative patients (hazard ratio, 5.17; P < .05), despite a similar risk of DBF. PTEN loss was associated with increased risk of DBF (P < .05), whereas EGFR and ALK aberrations were associated with a decreased risk of local disease recurrence (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study quantified the frequency of genetic aberrations in patients with AC-BMs and demonstrated their association with intracranial outcomes. In particular, a cohort of patients with KRAS mutations and >=6 BMs were identified to be at high risk of requiring salvage WBRT after undergoing upfront stereotactic radiosurgery.",Excluded
3286,"Acute vision loss: A potential novel indication for intraarterial chemotherapy in the treatment of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (case report) Congress Abstract Introduction: The combination of radiotherapy and concomitant intraarterial cisplatin (RADPLAT) is well recognized in controlling locally invasive unresectable sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC). However, no reliable data are available for acute administration of intraarterial chemotherapy alone for palliation of acute vision loss in patients with unresectable SNUC involving the optic nerve. Objective(s): To suggest a novel indication for compassionate use of intraarterial chemotherapy alone in the acute setting in patients with advanced SNUC associated vision loss. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented with bloody nasal discharge, left proptosis, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. Both CT and MRI of the head and neck revealed a large 6.2-cm sinonasal mass extending through the cribriform plate to the dural, left maxillary sinus, and left orbit resulting proptosis with involvement of the optic nerve. The patient was not a surgical candidate due to intracranial extension with dural involvement. The patient's visual acuity in the left eye was 2400/20 on presentation. The patient underwent biopsy, which revealed SNUC. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning requires approximately 1 week to orchestrate at our institution. We decided to administer supratherapeutic intraarterial cisplatin acutely, along with thiosulfate infusion without radiation in an attempt to save the patient's vision. The patient experienced an increase in pain initially. However, over the following 5 days, the degree of proptosis diminished markedly and vision improved substantially without IMRT. The patient's follow-up vision testing revealed 30/20 vision in the left eye at 1 week and 20/20 vision at 2 weeks following therapy. Subsequent MRI revealed marked necrosis and decrease in size of the mass. Conclusion(s): Although we are not specifically advocating intraarterial administration of chemotherapy alone for the treatment of head and neck tumors, it may be effective in the acute setting for palliation of acute vision loss related to compression by head and neck tumors such as SNUC.",Excluded
3382,"Fractional anisotropy dose-response relationship of the corpus callosum Purpose or Objective: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive modality for determination of water diffusion properties. Fractional anisotropy (FA) quantifies the extent of directionality of water diffusion. We investigated absorbed dose as a predictor of FA change in the corpus callosum (CC) following radiation therapy for high grade glioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with high-grade glioma underwent DTI scans before, and ten months after radiation therapy to 59.4-60 Gy. Diffusion data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Using an automated white matter fiber tracking technique, 23 fiber tracts were segmented on the baseline and follow-up DTI images. The CT images used for treatment planning and both DTI image sets were aligned using non-linear registration. This way, the baseline FA, the follow-up FA, and the absorbed dose could be determined for each voxel in all 15 patients. For each voxel in the CC, we calculated the FA change as FA follow-up /FA baseline and dichotomized the data into a binary outcome variable using 0.5 as cutoff. For all 15 patients, logistic regression was used to determine dose-response curve parameters (D50 and g50) and their confidence intervals (CIs). We used the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) to evaluate the discriminative ability of the voxel dose. Then, we estimated dose-response curve parameters and calculated the AUC for each patient individually. Result(s): The median age was 59 (range: 40-85) years. The average CC volume and average CC mean absorbed dose was 62+/-8 cm3 and 26+/-14 Gy (1 SD), respectively. Using data from 99 691 voxels, the estimated parameters for the doseresponse curve for all patients (upper panel in Figure 1) were D50=88.0+/-0.1 Gy and gamma50=0.80+/-0.01 (95% CIs). The AUC was 0.71 indicating good discriminative ability. For nine out of 15 patients, the individual AUC was >=0.60, indicating that higher absorbed dose is associated with higher probability of FA change >=0.5. Dose -response curves for those patients are shown in the lower panel in Figure 1 and their estimated parameter values in Table 1. Individual D50s varied between 41.3 and 125.9 Gy. Conclusion(s): Absorbed dose was a significant predictor of FA change in the CC. This was the case both when all patients were pooled for analysis, and in nine out of 15 patients when analyzed separately. More detailed analyses are needed to better understand the effect radiation has on water diffusion in brain white matter. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
3562,"Adenosine A2A receptors are essential for long-term potentiation of NMDA-EPSCs at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses The physiological conditions under which adenosine A2A receptors modulate synaptic transmission are presently unclear. We show that A2A receptors are localized postsynaptically at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells and are essential for a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA-EPSCs induced by short bursts of mossy fiber stimulation. This LTP spares AMPA-EPSCs and is likely induced and expressed postsynaptically. It depends on a postsynaptic Ca2+ rise, on G protein activation, and on Src kinase. In addition to A2A receptors, LTP of NMDA-EPSCs requires the activation of NMDA and mGluR5 receptors as potential sources of Ca2+ increase. LTP of NMDA-EPSCs displays a lower threshold for induction as compared with the conventional presynaptic mossy fiber LTP; however, the two forms of LTP can combine with stronger induction protocols. Thus, postsynaptic A2A receptors may potentially affect information processing in CA3 neuronal networks and memory performance.",Excluded

METHOD(S): In 27 patients with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors a single intravenous injection of talaporfin sodium (40 mg/m2) was administered one day before surgical resection of the neoplasm. Next day after completion of the tumor removal the residual lesion and/or resection cavity were irradiated with 664-nmsemiconductor laser with a radiation power density of 150 mW/cm2 and radiation energy density of 27 J/cm2. The procedure was performed at 22-27 hours after drug administration. The study cohort included 22 patients with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumor. Thirteen of these neoplasms (59%) were newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RESULT(S): Among all 22 patients included into study cohort the 12-month overall survival (OS), 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), and 6-months local PFS rates after surgery and PDT were 95.5%, 91%, and 91%, respectively. Among patients with newly diagnosed GBM all these parameters were 100%. Side effects on the skin, which could be attributable to administration of talaporfin sodium, were noted in 7% of patients and included rush (2 cases), blister (1 case), and erythema (1 case). Skin photosensitivity test results were relatively mild and fully disappeared within 15 days after administration of photosensitizer in all patients. CONCLUSION(S): Intraoperative PDT using talaporfin sodium and semiconductor laser may be considered as potentially effective and sufficiently safe option for adjuvant management of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors. Its inclusion in combined treatment strategy may have a positive impact on OS and local tumor control, particularly in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.",Excluded

Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates have been proposed as the most viable biomarker for the diagnosis of AD. Here, we demonstrate hemicyanine-based benzothiazole-coumarin (TC) as a potential probe for the detection of highly toxic Abeta42 aggregates through switch-on, enhanced (~30 fold) red fluorescence (Emax = 654 nm) and characteristic colorimetric (light red to purple) optical outputs. Interestingly, TC exhibits selectivity towards Abeta42 fibrils compared to other abnormal protein aggregates. TC probe show nanomolar binding affinity (Ka = 1.72 x 10(7) M(-1)) towards Abeta42 aggregates and also displace ThT bound to Abeta42 fibrils due to its high binding affinity. The Abeta42 fibril-specific red-shift in the absorption spectra of TC responsible for the observed colorimetric optical output has been attributed to micro-environment change around the probe from hydrophilic-like to hydrophobic-like nature. The binding site, binding energy and changes in optical properties observed for TC upon interaction with Abeta42 fibrils have been further validated by molecular docking and time dependent density functional theory studies.",Excluded
3380,"[Effect of the psychostimulants caffeine and methylphenidate on the efficiency of physical activity in rats exposed to ionizing radiation] The authors carried out studies on 267 male rats and examined the effect of ionizing irradation (single irradation with 737 roentgens) on the duration of swimming and on the alteration of this effect by psychic stimulators caffeine and methylphenidate, administered in overthreshold doses (30 and 50 mg/kg of body weight for caffeine and 5 and 10 mg/kg of body weight for methylphenidate). On the 7th day after irradiation there was statistically significant shortening of the duration of swimming in the control animals. The mentioned doses (statistically significant for the larger dose) were used in nonirradiated animals and the two psychic stimulators also shortened the duration of swimming in comparison with the control nonirradiated animals. This effect could be explained by hyperexcitatory action of these doses of caffeine and methylphenidate. As a result of this, desoptimization of the cerebral activity occurred and as a consequence of which was the diminution of the efficiency of the physical activity. Together with this they observed that both psychic stimulators partially counteracted the shortening of the duration of swimming of rats, caused by ionizing irradiation itself. This effect, especially for caffeine, could be explained by the induced of the ionizing irradiation increase in the sensitivity of cerebral phosphodiesterase of rats to its inhibitor caffeine as a result of which under these conditions the effect of caffeine on the level of cerebral cyclic AMP was reinforced. The cyclic AMP is presumed to have some protective effect against ionizing irradiation.",Included

Expression of ATM fragments containing a leucine zipper motif in a human tumor cell line abrogated the S-phase checkpoint after ionizing irradiation and enhanced radiosensitivity and chromosomal breakage. These fragments did not abrogate irradiation-induced G1 or G2 checkpoints, suggesting that cell cycle checkpoint defects alone cannot account for chromosomal instability in ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells. Expression of the carboxy-terminal portion of ATM, which contains the PI-3 kinase domain, complemented radiosensitivity and the S-phase checkpoint and reduced chromosomal breakage after irradiation in AT cells.

We evaluated the effects of low-dose gamma-irradiation at a low-dose-rate on the FST-induced depletion of antioxidants in mouse organs. Mice received whole-body low-dose-rate (0.6 or 3.0 mGy/h) of low-dose gamma-irradiation for 1 week, followed by daily FSTs (5 days). The immobility rate on day 2 compared to day 1 was significantly lower in the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice than in sham irradiated mice. The FST significantly decreased the catalase (CAT) activity and total glutathione (t-GSH) content in the brain and kidney, respectively. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and t-GSH content in the liver of the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice were significantly lower than those of the non-FST-treated mice. The CAT activity in the lungs of mice exposed to 3.0 mGy/h gamma-irradiation was higher than that of non-FST treated mice and mice treated with FST. However, no significant differences were observed in the levels of these antioxidant markers between the sham and irradiated groups except for the CAT activity in lungs. These findings suggest that the effects of low-dose-rate and low-dose gamma-irradiation on FST are highly organ-dependent.",Included
2495,"Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery for multiple brain metastases Introduction Due to the neurocognitive side effects of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is being used with increasing frequency. The use of SRS is expanding for patients with multiple (>4) brain metastases (BM). This study summarizes our institutional experience with single-fraction, linear-accelerator-based SRS for multiple BM. Methods and materials All patients who were treated between January 1, 2013, and September 30, 2015, with single-fraction SRS for >=4 BM were included in this institutional review board-approved, retrospective, single-institution study. Patients were treated with linear accelerator-based image guided SRS. Results A total of 59 patients with >=4 BM were treated with single-fraction SRS. The median follow-up was 15.2 months, and the median overall survival for the entire cohort was 5.8 months. The median number of treated lesions per patient was 5 (range, 4-23). Per patient, the median planning target volume (PTV) was 4.8 cc (range, 0.7-28.8 cc). The prescribed dose across all 380 BM for the 59 patients ranged from 7 to 20 Gy. The median of the mean dose to the total PTV was 19.5 Gy. Although the number of treated lesions (4-5 vs >=6) did not influence survival, better survival was noted for a total PTV <10 cc versus >=10 cc (7.1 vs 4.2 months, respectively; P =.0001). A mean dose of >=19 Gy to the entire PTV was also associated with increased survival (6.6 vs 5.0 months, respectively; P =.0172). Patients receiving a dose of >12 Gy to >=10 cc of normal brain had worse survival (5.1 vs 8.6 months, respectively; P =.0028). Conclusion In single-fraction SRS for patients with multiple BM, smaller total tumor volume, higher total dose, and lower volume of normal brain receiving >12 Gy were associated with increased survival. These data suggest that using SRS for the treatment of multiple BM is efficacious and that outcomes may be affected more by total tumor volume than by the number of lesions.

SGR values in terms of weight for 5 and 10 days under 3 time-frames were 17.12%, 12.52%, 11.46% and 9.09%, 6.43%, 6.09% respectively, which revealed a declined trend along with the exposure days. In the skin of C. batrachus, the compact regular orientation of the stratified epithelial cells and mucous cells became distorted and the microridges and double-ridged structures showed destruction and fragmentations. The body striations and microfolds became shrinked and swollen and finally degenerated to form a mass. The distribution of mucous cells throughout the epidermis was disorganised and releasing secretory contents on the surface through small pores. Appearance of huge quantity of biogenic semi-hexagonal plate like crystals (guanine platelets) on the skin surface of the body was the most significant observations during UV-B radiation. In the developmental phases the eyeball showed shrinkage loosing normal regular concave structure and to become a dome-shaped one. The supportive connective infoldings became loosened. The choroid coat displayed deformities and the iris deformed the pupil. The fibroblast on the epithelium and melanocytes depicted dispersed arrangement. The pairs of ventral barbels near the mouth depicted the presence of taste buds that became severely damaged exposing the sensory as well as neuroepithelial cells. Compact regular arrangement of the SECs was completely destroyed leaving long and deep channels inbetween them; the disintegrated concentric MRs also showed a mass.",Excluded
3306,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for metastatic brain tumors We reviewed our series of metastatic brain tumors treated by Gamma Knife Radiosurgery. From May 1992 to January 2001, 115 consecutive patients with 425 lesions were treated over 128 treatment sessions. Forty three patients were known to have died at the end of the recording period. The mean follow-up duration was 11.6 months and mean number of lesions was 3.5. The most common primary sites were lung and breast. Mean tumor volume was 4.2 cm<sup>3</sup> and mean margin dose was 16.2 Gy. 6-month, 1-year, and 18-month survival rates were 73.6, 58, and 46%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher KPS scores, no evidence of extracranial metastasis, and controlled primary disease were significantly related to longer survival. Adjuvant whole brain irradiation did not significantly influence on the prolongation of survival time and local control of radiosurgically treated lesions. Copyright © 2002 S.

2935,Neuromuscular toxicity of therapy The peripheral nervous system is frequently impaired in patients who have cancer. This impairment often results from toxicity of treatment but may also be due to direct invasion by tumor or may be part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. This review summarizes the recent literature regarding peripheral neuropathies and myopathies that are seen in patients with cancer. Highlights include the neuromuscular toxicity of some of the newer chemotherapeutic agents and immune mediators such as taxol and interleukin-2; a discussion of some of the agents being investigated for chemoprotection and rescue; an assessment of the evidence supporting the concept of motor neuron disease as a paraneoplastic disorder; and an interesting case report of megakaryoblastic leukemia invading peripheral nerves. Also summarized are some nice reviews and prospective studies of the toxicity of more conventional treatments. [References: 27],Excluded
2865,"[A case of chronic progressive radiation myelopathy--a diagnostic significance of gadolinium-DTPA enhancement MRI] A 65-year-old man had a biopsy diagnosis of right cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Post operative irradiation (4000 rads) was given to the bilateral cervical areas. Twenty five months after completion of irradiation, the patient developed muscle weakness in the right upper and lower extremities, and sensory disturbance below the C2 level in the left side, which was considered as Brown-Sequard syndrome. MRI of T1 weighted images (T1W1) showed mild swelling of the spinal cord from C1 to C6, while T2 weighted images (T2W1) revealed high intensity area at the same level. Gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA injection revealed ring enhancement in the right side of the spinal cord from C1 to C2 on sagittal and axial images. The neurological symptoms improved after the administration of corticosteroid. Two weeks after the therapy, a follow-up study revealed disappearance of cervical cord swelling on T1W1 and high intensity area was remarkably diminished on T2W1. Gd-DTPA enhancement, however, showed unremarkable change. Gd-DTPA enhancement was suggested to be a sensitive and valuable diagnostic method of CPRM.",Excluded
2783,"A preliminary comparative treatment planning study for radiotherapy of age-related maculopathy PURPOSE: We present a comparative planning of different approaches for external radiotherapy in age-related maculopathies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calculated dose distributions and dose-volume histograms for (a) bilateral irradiation with 6 MV photons, (b) a single lateral-oblique beam using either photons, electrons or protons and (c) an anterior circular proton beam.RESULTS: For lateral photon or electron beams the dose to the lens is usually lower than 10% of the dose to the macula. The entrance doses for bilateral photon beams are about 50% which increase up to 100% at the orbital bone. About 5 mm of optic nerves are irradiated at the maximal dose while the optic chiasma is spared. A single photon beam gives 50% of the dose to the fellow eye. The electron beam spares the fellow eye but gives a rather inhomogeneous dose to the target volume. For a lateral proton beam, 4 mm of optic nerve receives 90% of the dose, the skin dose is at least 70% of the dose to the macula and the lens and the fellow eye are spared. An anterior proton beam gives 90% of the dose to 1 mm of optic nerve and the 50% isodose approaches the periphery of the lens.CONCLUSION: Doses to the critical structures can be dramatically diminished for all the techniques by reducing the beam size, but only if very precise set-up techniques are used. Proton beams are an attractive solution, but the impact of such a choice on the use of proton facilities and on the national health system should be carefully evaluated, as well as the risk of radio-induced secondary neoplasias.",Excluded
3216,"Radiation injury & mercury deposits in internal organs as a result of thallium-201 chloride intravenous injection for SPECT imaging; additional biochemical information obtained in the images of organs from SPECT or PET scans; & potential injury due to radiation exposure during long distance flights In order to study functional as well as anatomical aspects of various internal organs, SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography) has been used extensively for evaluation of these organs. For SPECT study, intravenous injection of radioactive substances such as technetium-99m (20 millicuries) & thallium-201 chloride (3 millicuries) is commonly used. Although the physical half-life of thallium-201 chloride is 73 hours, its biological half-life is often more than 3.5 times that. Following intravenous injection of thallium-201 chloride it is concentrated in the heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, thyroid gland, testes or ovaries, and then eventually decays to mercury. Because of its relatively long physical & biological half-lives, thallium-201 chloride may produce mild radiation injury while it remains radioactive. Similar injuries may be induced by technetium-99m (often used for brain SPECT), which radiates Gamma rays (140 KeV), but since its physical half-life is only 6 hours, the side effects are not as significant as those of thallium-201 chloride. Since the main component of thallium-201 chloride radiation is X-ray (68-82 KeV), which consists of photons with a very short wavelength and a high penetrating power, prolonged exposure can induce electromagnetic field-induced injury. As a previous study of the principal author on electromagnetic field exposure indicated, electromagnetic field-induced injury causes the change of L-amino acids to D-amino acids. 2 days after SPECT study of the heart with intravenous injection of thallium-201 chloride, the principal author experienced shortness of breath, loss of appetite, dizziness, fever, and general malaise within the week, and found a progressively significant increase in D-glutamic acid and decrease in L-glutamic acid peaking 2 weeks after the initial injection but lasting for many weeks after in organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas, thyroid gland & testes, where radioactive substances had accumulated and radiation was at an average of about 400 counts/min. Even 2 months after the initial injection, the abnormal ratio of D-amino acids and L-amino acids had not returned to normal (in the radiation exposed heart, L-amino acids: 6 mg/dl with D-amino acids: 5 mg/dl; normal tissue, L-amino acids: 10 mg/dl with D-amino acids < 1 mg/dl). The principal author tried to find a safe method of reducing possible radiation injury and accelerating the elimination of the already deposited mercury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Excluded
3599,"Unusual Physiological Properties of Smooth Monostratified Ganglion Cell Types in Primate Retina The functions of the diverse retinal ganglion cell types in primates and the parallel visual pathways they initiate remain poorly understood. Here, unusual physiological and computational properties of the ON and OFF smooth monostratified ganglion cells are explored. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings from 48 macaque retinas revealed that these cells exhibit irregular receptive field structure composed of spatially segregated hotspots, quite different from the classic center-surround model of retinal receptive fields. Surprisingly, visual stimulation of different hotspots in the same cell produced spikes with subtly different spatiotemporal voltage signatures, consistent with a dendritic contribution to hotspot structure. Targeted visual stimulation and computational inference demonstrated strong nonlinear subunit properties associated with each hotspot, supporting a model in which the hotspots apply nonlinearities at a larger spatial scale than bipolar cells. These findings reveal a previously unreported nonlinear mechanism in the output of the primate retina that contributes to signaling spatial information.",Excluded
2892,"Radiotherapy in older patients with GBM The incidence of glioblastoma in the elderly population has increased over the last few decades. Current treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy, but the optimal management of disease remains a matter of debate. RT remains an effective treatment in elderly patients with GBM and either standard RT or hypofractionated RT are associated with longer survival than supportive care only. Randomized studies comparing standard RT versus hypofractionated radiation schedules show similar survival benefits, although short-courses RT are associated with a better safety profile. Hypofractionated RT should be chosen in older patients with newly diagnosed GBM, especially in those with poor performance status or older than 70 years old. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a safe and effective treatment option alternative to RT. Recent randomized studies indicates that chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide is a safe and effective therapeutic option in patients of 60 years or older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Decisions regarding the choice between RT and TMZ chemotherapy should be based on the assessment of O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter gene. Patients with MGMT methylated tumors receive the most significant survival benefit from treatment with TMZ; by contrast, chemotherapy produces no benefit in patients with MGMT unmethylated tumors, suggesting that RT is a better option in these patients. Few studies have reported survival benefit in elderly patients treated with a combination of standard RT with concomitant and adjuvant TMZ. Although this may represent a feasible therapeutic approach in selected patients of 60-70 years old with good performance status, the potential toxicity of standard RT and chemotherapy for large irradiated brain volumes, and the modest survival advantages in this age group as compared with younger patients, do not support the use of aggressive treatments in the majority of elderly patients. An abbreviated course of RT plus TMZ may represent a feasible treatment associated with similar survival benefit and improved quality of life. Results from an EORTC large randomized study comparing a short course of RT (40 Gy in 15 daily fractions) with or without concomitant and adjuvant TMZ in elderly patients older than 65 years old with newly diagnosed GBM indicate that RT+TMZ is a safe and effective treatment in older GBM patients.

The new advancements are mostly in modeling of operator knowledge-based behavior in accident conditions, enhancing realism of the IDAC model, and simulation approach to Human Reliability Analysis (HRA). The focus is situation assessment and diagnosis of the accident cause. Knowledge-based reasoning plays an important role in this phase. A reasoning module has been developed and implemented in ADS-IDAC to simulate operators' knowledge-based reasoning. This paper describes the cognitive architecture of the reasoning module, including knowledge representation (model of operator's understanding of the plant systems and functions), a memory representation, information processing flow, reasoning sequence generation, and rules for accident diagnosis. Some theoretical and empirical insights for human error prediction are embedded in this causal model as simulation rules. Human cognitive limitations and heuristics that potentially contribute to human errors are explicitly modeled. Together with the model description, several example simulations are provided to demonstrate different features of the reasoning module. Examples of the simulation show that the reasoning module in ADS-IDAC produces realistic knowledge-based responses by capturing cognitive limitations, deliberative reasoning, and dynamic of accident progression.

2703,"Space missions: psychological and psychopathological issues Exploring space is one of the most attractive goals that humanity ever set, notwithstanding, there are some psychological and psychopathological risks that should be considered. Several studies identified some possible hazards of space travels and related physical and psychological consequences on astronauts. If some psychological reactions are obviously inherent to the characteristics of the spaceships (habitability, confinement, psychological, and interpersonal relationships), other (disturbances of sleep-wake cycle, personality changes, depression, anxiety, apathy, psychosomatic symptoms, neurovestibular problems, alterations in cognitive function, and sensory perception) represent a clear warning of possible central nervous system (CNS) alterations, possibly due to microgravity and cosmic radiation. Such conditions and eventual CNS changes might compromise the success of missions and the ability to cope with unexpected events and may lead to individual and long-term impairments. Therefore, further studies are needed, perhaps, requiring the birth of a novel branch of psychology/psychiatry that should not only consider the risks related to space exploration, but the implementation of targeted strategies to prevent them.",Excluded

This article presents the results of 123 patients treated for a brain AVM at the Gamma Knife Center ULB-Hopital Erasme. Radiosurgical treatment is proposed following multidisciplinary discussion of the best therapeutic strategy based on specific parameters of the AVM. Gamma Knife irradiation was achieved for an AVM residue after endovascular embolization for 84 % of patients, after microsurgery for 7 % of patients, or after previous radiosurgical irradiation for 6 % of patients. The whole volume of the nidus was irradiated in a single session for all patients. A mean margin dose of 22.3 Gy was delivered to the nidus, which had a mean volume of 3.3 cc. The maximum dose ranged from 30 Gy to 50 Gy (mean 44.1 Gy). All patients were prospectively followed after treatment with serial angio-MR and/or conventional angiography. A retrospective analysis shows complete obliteration of the AVM for 109 patients (89 %) after 6 to 52 months (mean 32 months). For 14 patients the nidus was only partially obliterated from the radiosurgical procedure; for 9 patients a second irradiation was performed with subsequent complete occlusion of the AVM in all cases. So, 118 of 123 patients (96 %) irradiated by Gamma Knife in 1 or 2 sessions were cured. Four patients bled after irradiation and before complete occlusion of the AVM, with neurological deficit for 2 patients. Transient neurological symptoms develop after treatment for 12 patients (10 %), associated with postradic edema treated with corticoids. Permanent neurological worsening occurred in5 patients (4 %).

Transmission scans (3 min per step, eight or nine steps according to the height of the subject) in 2D mode were used for subsequent attenuation correction of emission scans. Emission scans (1 min per step, eight or nine steps) were acquired over 2 h. Venous blood samples and urine were collected up to 2 h after injection of the radiotracer. For each subject, the percentage of injected activity measured in regions of interest over brain, intestine, lungs, kidneys and liver was fitted to a mono-exponential model, as an uptake phase followed by a mono-exponential washout, for urinary bladder to generate time-activity curves. Using the MIRD method, several source organs were considered in estimating residence time and mean effective radiation absorbed doses.RESULTS: Blood pressure and ECG findings remained unchanged after tracer injection. The analysed blood and urine pharmacological parameters did not change significantly after [(11)C]raclopride injection. The primary routes of clearance were renal and intestinal. Ten minutes after injection, high activities were observed in the gall-bladder, kidneys and liver. High activity was observed in the gall-bladder during the whole study. The kidneys, urinary bladder wall, liver and gall-bladder received the highest absorbed doses. The average effective dose of [11C]raclopride was estimated to be 6.7+/-0.4 microSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: The amount of [11C]raclopride required for adequate dopamine D2 receptor imaging results in an acceptable effective dose equivalent, permitting two or three repeated clinical PET imaging studies, with the injection of 222 MBq for each study.",Excluded

3522,"A prospective evaluation of the effects of chronic proton pump inhibitor use on plasma biomarker levels in humans Introduction: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used primarily to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. PPI-induced achlorhydria increases circulating gastrin and chromogranin A (CGA). CGA is a widely used biomarker for the diagnosis and follow-up for gut-based neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). PPI-induced increases in CGA or gastrin may falsely suggest the presence of a NET when none exists. Pancreastatin, a fragment of CGA, is also commonly used to diagnose and follow NETs. Aim(s): We hypothesized that chronic PPI use would increase circulating plasma gastrin, CGA and pancreastatin levels. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients who used PPIs for six months or more (mean duration 3.1 +/-2.5 years) and a separate control group of thirty patients who never used antacid medications were prospectively evaluated with plasma gastrin, CGA and pancreastatin determinations. Result(s): Chronic PPI use resulted in significant increases in CGA (15.1+/-11 vs. 131+/-207 ng/ml, p=0.005) and significant increases in gastrin (34.8+/-22.3 vs. 167.8+/-136.2 pg/ml, p=0.001) compared to controls.

Methods A PINS-TSE sequence was implemented and combined with blipped CAIPI to improve the reconstruction of superposed slices. Whole brain imaging of healthy volunteers was performed at both 3T and 7T using a 32-channel coil for signal reception. Results A considerable reduction in power deposition was achieved compared with a standard sequence of the manufacturer. At 3T, the reduction in specific absorption rate (SAR) made short pulse repetition times (TRs) possible, however, in order to obtain a good T2 contrast, it is advisable to maintain TR while extending the echo train length. At 7T, whole brain coverage with a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 x 2 mm<sup>3</sup> was achieved in an acquisition time of 150 s. Furthermore, it could be shown that pulse sequences that use PINS pulses do not suffer from having additional magnetization transfer contrast. Conclusion PINS RF pulses combined with multiband imaging reduce SAR sufficiently to enable routine TSE imaging at 7T within clinically acceptable acquisition times. In general, the combination of multiband imaging with PINS RF pulses represents a method to reduce total RF power deposition. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

These x-ray beams are typically generated on a synchrotron source. It was shown that these beam geometries allow exceptional normal tissue sparing from radiation damage while still being effective in tumour ablation. A final biological explanation for this enhanced therapeutic ratio has still not been found, some experimental data support an important role of the vasculature. In this work, the effect of microbeams on a normal microvascular network of the cerebral cortex was assessed in computer simulations and compared to the effect of homogeneous, seamless exposures at equal energy absorption. The anatomy of a cerebral microvascular network and the inflicted radiation damage were simulated to closely mimic experimental data using a novel probabilistic model of radiation damage to blood vessels. It was found that the spatial dose fractionation by microbeam arrays significantly decreased the vascular damage. The higher the peak-to-valley dose ratio, the more pronounced the sparing effect. Simulations of the radiation damage as a function of morphological parameters of the vascular network demonstrated that the distribution of blood vessel radii is a key parameter determining both the overall radiation damage of the vasculature and the dose-dependent differential effect of microbeam irradiation.",Excluded

Straylight values were measured before surgery and 3 months after surgery using the Oculus C-Quant (Oculus Optikgerate). Furthermore, correlations were analyzed between straylight and the following parameters: keratometry, axial length, spherical equivalent, astigmatism, pIOL power, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, and pupil size.RESULTS: Mean straylight decreased from 1.18 +/- 0.17 log units before surgery to 1.13 +/- 0.17 after surgery (P = .016). Higher preoperative straylight values were associated with larger postoperative decreases in straylight (r = -0.534; P < .001). Higher postoperative straylight values were correlated to higher axial length (r = 0.444; P = .001) and lower keratometry values in diopters (r = -0.414; P = .001). After regression analysis, only axial length was found to be an independent predictor of preoperative and postoperative straylight (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). After correcting for the axial length of an emmetropic eye (23.44 mm), all straylight correlations disappeared, indicating that an increase in distance from cornea to retina explains the increase in straylight values in longer eyes.CONCLUSIONS: Retinal straylight was reduced significantly after Artiflex pIOL implantation. Besides age, axial length was the only predictor of preoperative and postoperative straylight values. The increased tissue length light has to pass from cornea to retina, might explain the increase in straylight values in longer eyes.",Excluded

We hypothesized that a modification of pain threshold after STN-DBS would suggest a central modification of pain perception, whereas the absence of pain threshold change after STN-DBS would correspond to a peripheral mechanism via a decrease of painful stimuli.METHODS: Nineteen patients with Parkinson disease were included in this double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Postoperatively, we evaluated pain thresholds (thermal and mechanical) and motor symptoms under 3 acute conditions: stimulation on/medication off; stimulation off/medication on; and stimulation off/medication off. We also conducted a retrospective analysis of the data prospectively recorded during the follow-up of the cohort pre- and postoperatively (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] score, Hoehn and Yahr stage, equivalent levodopa daily dose, and tapping test score).RESULTS: We found a significant increase of pain and tolerance mechanical thresholds not only after acute STN-DBS but also after acute levodopa administration. We did not find any significant correlation between postoperative clinical pain improvement and UPDRS-III improvement after acute levodopa or STN-DBS, nor with motor complications improvement assessed with UPDRS-IV after chronic STN-DBS.

Fourteen patients received 3-dimensional image guided intratumoral injection of aminosilane coated iron oxide nanoparticles. The patients were then exposed to an alternating magnetic field to induce particle heating. The amount of fluid and the spatial distribution of the depots were planned in advance by means of a specially developed treatment planning software following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The actually achieved magnetic fluid distribution was measured by computed tomography (CT), which after matching to pre-operative MRI data enables the calculation of the expected heat distribution within the tumor in dependence of the magnetic field strength. Patients received 4-10 (median: 6) thermotherapy treatments following instillation of 0.1-0.7 ml (median: 0.2) of magnetic fluid per ml tumor volume and single fractions (2 Gy) of a radiotherapy series of 16-70 Gy (median: 30). Thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles was tolerated well by all patients with minor or no side effects. Median maximum intratumoral temperatures of 44.6degreeC (42.4-49.5degreeC) were measured and signs of local tumor control were observed.

[German] This study examined to which extent treatment plans for brain tumors can be constructed with a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) based on MRI data only. Cad-Plan 6.4.7 was used as TPS. In particular, differences between MRT-based and conventional CT-based plans were examined systematically. The quantification of the retrospective evaluation was carried out by the point-wise dose difference and the gamma-distribution. In this study the gamma-distribution did not appear advantageous over the dose difference for the tolerance range (point-wise dose difference <3%, distance criterion LLL 5 mm). The calculated dose distribution showed large differences (up to 103%) at the boundary of the treatment fields, in the regions of the head contour, and in areas with air inclusions and significant bone structures. The inner parts of the fields, and therefore the actual target volume, revealed only small deviations in the range of -2% in the homogeneous distribution.",Excluded

Irradiation with ultraviolet light (UV) led to inhibition of spontaneous impulses and after UV-off, an afterinhibition which lasted for a few minutes. This afterinhibition was rapidly overcome by exposure to visible light (VIS). UV-VIS antagonism of this type was identified in six different impulse systems monitored in extracellular recordings. Intracellular recordings from two of the six cell types showed that UV irradiation causes hyperpolarization which inhibits spontaneous activity. The other cell types showed no membrane potential changes during UV irradiation even though the cells' spontaneous outputs were inhibited. It was concluded that the photosensitivity lies in three kinds of nerves which are distributed widely through the subtentacular region and the nerve ring.",Excluded

In this study, we evaluated the ability of irradiation to regulate the transcription of a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vector, Ad.Egr-1/lacZ, containing the radiation-inducible Egr-1 promoter driving the beta-galactosidase reporter gene in glioma cells. Transcripts of the Egr-1 gene in human and rat glioma cells were induced following irradiation with as little as 2 Gy. This dose was 10-fold less than previously reported, and comparable to doses of irradiation used clinically in standard fractionated radiotherapy for brain tumors. When 9L rat gliosarcoma cells were infected with Ad.Egr-1/lacZ in vitro and exposed to 2 Gy of external beam irradiation, there was a threefold increase in beta-galactosidase expression. Irradiation of intracerebral 9L tumors infected with the Ad.Egr-1/lacZ virus, using either external beam radiotherapy (2 Gy) or the thymidine analog 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine radiolabeled with the Auger electron emitter iodine-125 ([125I]IdUrd), also resulted in increased beta-galactosidase activity of the tumor cells. These results indicate that the use of viral vectors containing radiation-inducible promoters represents a novel therapeutic approach that enables gene therapy to be spatially and temporally regulated by ionizing radiation. These findings also support a potential role for radiation-inducible promoters in the treatment of malignant brain tumors.",Excluded

3334,"Gold Nanorod-assisted Optical Stimulation of Neuronal Cells Recent studies have demonstrated that nerves can be stimulated in a variety of ways by the transient heating associated with the absorption of infrared light by water in neuronal tissue. This technique holds great potential for replacing or complementing standard stimulation techniques, due to the potential for increased localization of the stimulus and minimization of mechanical contact with the tissue. However, optical approaches are limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate deep into tissues. Moreover, thermal modelling suggests that cumulative heating effects might be potentially hazardous when multiple stimulus sites or high laser repetition rates are used. The protocol outlined below describes an enhanced approach to the infrared stimulation of neuronal cells. The underlying mechanism is based on the transient heating associated with the optical absorption of gold nanorods, which can cause triggering of neuronal cell differentiation and increased levels of intracellular calcium activity. These results demonstrate that nanoparticle absorbers can enhance and/or replace the process of infrared neural stimulation based on water absorption, with potential for future applications in neural prostheses and cell therapies.",Excluded

In these two structures we evaluated spike amplitude, area, duration, rise time and mean total firing rate. The recording spike density was higher in the STN than in the SNr (94% vs. 28%). Microelectrode recordings showed a larger spike area and amplitude in the SNr than in the STN ([mean+/-SD] amplitude: 46.7+/-31.1 vs. 36.3+/-29.6 microV; area: 25.6+/-24.2 vs. 36.7+/-21.4 microVmsec), a higher total firing rate at rest in the SNr than in the STN (78.6+/-53.5 vs. 61.9+/-40.8 Hz), and a longer duration and rise time in the SNr than in the STN (duration: 2.0+/-1 vs. 1.3+/-0.6 ms; rise time: 0.95+/-0.6 vs. 0.67+/-0.3 ms).

2690,"Microneurography as a tool in clinical neurophysiology to investigate peripheral neural traffic in humans Microneurography is a method using metal microelectrodes to investigate directly identified neural traffic in myelinated as well as unmyelinated efferent and afferent nerves leading to and coming from muscle and skin in human peripheral nerves in situ. The present paper reviews how this technique has been used in clinical neurophysiology to elucidate the neural mechanisms of autonomic regulation, motor control and sensory functions in humans under physiological and pathological conditions. Microneurography is particularly important to investigate efferent and afferent neural traffic in unmyelinated C fibers. The recording of efferent discharges in postganglionic sympathetic C efferent fibers innervating muscle and skin (muscle sympathetic nerve activity; MSNA and skin sympathetic nerve activity; SSNA) provides direct information about neural control of autonomic effector organs including blood vessels and sweat glands. Sympathetic microneurography has become a potent tool to reveal neural functions and dysfunctions concerning blood pressure control and thermoregulation. This recording has been used not only in wake conditions but also in sleep to investigate changes in sympathetic neural traffic during sleep and sleep-related events such as sleep apnea. The same recording was also successfully carried out by astronauts during spaceflight. Recordings of afferent discharges from muscle mechanoreceptors have been used to understand the mechanisms of motor control. Muscle spindle afferent information is particularly important for the control of fine precise movements. It may also play important roles to predict behavior outcomes during learning of a motor task. Recordings of discharges in myelinated afferent fibers from skin mechanoreceptors have provided not only objective information about mechanoreceptive cutaneous sensation but also the roles of these signals in fine motor control. Unmyelinated mechanoreceptive afferent discharges from hairy skin seem to be important to convey cutaneous sensation to the central structures related to emotion. Recordings of afferent discharges in thin myelinated and unmyelinated fibers from nociceptors in muscle and skin have been used to provide information concerning pain. Recordings of afferent discharges of different types of cutaneous C-nociceptors identified by marking method have become an important tool to reveal the neural mechanisms of cutaneous sensations such as an itch. No direct microneurographic evidence has been so far proved regarding the effects of sympathoexcitation on sensitization of muscle and skin sensory receptors at least in healthy humans.

3209,"Low level laser therapy alters satellite glial cell expression and reverses nociceptive behavior in rats with neuropathic pain BACKGROUND: Nerve injury often results in persistent or chronic neuropathic pain characterized by spontaneous burning pain accompanied by allodynia and hyperalgesia. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is a noninvasive method that has proved to be clinically effective in reducing pain sensitivity and consequently in improving the quality of life. Here we examined the effects of LLLT on pain sensitivity induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats. CCI was performed on adult male rats, subjected thereafter to 10 sessions of LLLT, every other day, and starting 14 days after CCI. Over the treatment period, the animals were evaluated for nociception using behavioral tests, such as allodynia, thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. Following the sessions, we observed the involvement of satellite glial cells in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence approaches. In addition we analyzed the expression levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1beta) and fractalkine (FKN) after the same stimulus.RESULTS: LLLT induced an early reduction (starting at the second session; p <= 0.001) of the mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia in CCI rats, which persisted until the last session. Regarding cellular changes, we observed a decrease of GFAP (50%; p <= 0.001) expression after LLLT in the ipsilateral DRG when compared with the naive group. We also observed a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines after CCI, whereas LLLT dramatically inhibited the overexpression of these proteins.CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that LLLT reverses CCI-induced behavioral hypersensitivity, reduces glial cell activation in the DRG and decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines; we suggest that this involvement of glial cells can be one potential mechanism in such an effect.",Excluded

The electron microscopic investigation of the repeatedly exposed retinas revealed degenerative changes in the retinal neurons. The neurons appeared depleted of their cytoplasmic constituents and often contained phago-lysosomal structures with myelin bodies. There were many degenerating synaptic boutons. The glial cells displayed reactive changes. These ultrastructural changes could not be demonstrated by the other methods used. A single microwave exposure, followed by an induced 70--100% blood-pressure increase, did not enhance blood-retina barrier permeability to tracers. There was no evidence of blood brain barrier leakage. These studies show that the rabbit eye can be affected by microwave radiation at intensities lower than previously reported.",Excluded
2743,"Fictive swimming motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish Larval zebrafish provide a unique model for investigating the mechanisms involved in generating rhythmic patterns of behavior, such as swimming, due to the array of techniques available including genetics, optical imaging, and conventional electrophysiology. Because electrophysiological and imaging studies of rhythmic motor behaviors in paralyzed preparations depend on the ability to monitor the central motor pattern, we developed a fictive preparation in which the activity of axial motor neurons was monitored using extracellular recordings from peripheral nerves. We examined spontaneous and light induced fictive motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish (4-6 days post-fertilization) paralyzed with curare. All spontaneous and light-induced preparations produced alternation of motor activity from side-to-side (mean contralateral phase = 50.7 +/- 7.0%; mean burst frequency = 35.6 +/- 4.7 Hz) and a progression of activity from head-to-tail (mean ipsilateral rostrocaudal delay = 0.8 +/- 0.5 ms per segment), consistent with lateral undulation and forward propulsion during swimming, respectively. The basic properties of the motor pattern were similar in spontaneous and light-induced swimming. This fictive preparation can be used in combination with conventional electrophysiological and imaging methods to investigate normal circuit function as well as to elucidate functional deficits in mutant lines. Toward this end, we show that two accordion class mutants, accordion and bandoneon, have alternating activity on opposite sides of the body, contradicting the hypothesis that their deficit results from the absence of the reciprocal glycinergic inhibition that is typically found in the spinal cord of swimming vertebrates.",Excluded

The world's first mobile electron linear accelerator (Mobetron) has changed the way cancer patients are treated.1 This study is designed to test the anaesthetic management of patients receiving a combination of extensive surgery and intraoperative radiation using the Mobetron combined with remote monitoring. Safety and effectiveness of the Mobetron will also be assessed. Our initial study was to analyse the difference between patients who underwent surgery with and without IORT using the Mobetron. A further study was designed to assess neutron leakage measurements around the target tumour bed with a semi-conducting electrode. Twenty-four patients with locally advanced primary or locally recurrent cancer were recruited into this prospective study and were randomly assigned into the Mobetron group (n=12) and the control group (n=12). General anaesthesia was delivered during surgery. Narcotrend measurements for depth of anaesthesia and noxious stimulation were made. Radiation was delivered directly to the tumour bed or target section with the use of the Mobetron immediately after surgey (resection/laparotomy). The dose rate around the target tumour bed or target section was assessed with a semi-conducting electrode. During the 2 min of intraoperative radiation therapy, patients and monitors were observed via closed-circuit camera.2 No serious complications related to anaesthesia (cardiac failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, and cerebral dysfunction) occurred. The level of anaesthesia, recovery time, intraoperative haemorrhage, blood transfusion, urinary output, crystalloid and colloid infusion, lowest temperature, SpO2 (%), E'CO<inf>2</inf>, were similar in two groups. The addition of radiotherapy extends the total time of anaesthesia by 20-30 min. The dose rate at the region around target is much lower than the target (0.11 Gy min<sup>-1</sup> vs 1.17 Gy min<sup>-1</sup>). The majority of patients were stable (haemodynamic and respiratory) enough to be discharged from the ICU to the ward within 3 days. Adequate preoperative assessment and preparation, reasonable anaesthesia management with the help of adequate remote monitoring, and effective multidisciplinary (Table Presented) communication all contribute to make IORT procedures feasible and safe. IORT has allowed a selective treatment approach to locally advanced primary and recurrent neoplasm which traditionally would have been deemed unresectable.

2417,"Potential Improvements in Brain Dose Estimates For Internal Emitters BACKGROUND: Element-specific biokinetic models are used to reconstruct doses to systemic tissues from internal emitters. Typically, a systemic model for a radionuclide explicitly depicts only its dominant repositories. Remaining tissues and fluids are aggregated into a pool called Other tissue in which the radionuclide is assumed to be uniformly distributed. In the systemic biokinetic models used in radiation protection, the brain usually is addressed as an implicit mass fraction of Other tissue rather than an explicitly depicted repository. Due to increasing interest in radiation effects on the brain, efforts are underway to improve brain dosimetry for internal radiation sources.METHODS: We assessed potential improvements in brain dosimetry for internal emitters by explicitly modelling brain kinetics rather than treating the brain as a mass fraction of Other tissue. We selected ten elements for which brain kinetics can be modeled using published biokinetic data. Injection dose coefficients were calculated for a relatively long-lived radioisotope of each element using each of two versions of the ICRP's latest systemic biokinetic model for each element, the original version and a modified version differing only in the treatment of brain. If the ICRP model contained an explicit brain pool, the modified version depicted brain instead as a mass fraction of Other tissue. If the ICRP model included brain in Other tissue, the modified version included an explicit brain pool with kinetics based on best available brain-specific data.RESULTS: The result for a given radionuclide is expressed as a ratio A:B, where A and B are the dose coefficients based on the versions of the model with and without an explicit brain pool, respectively. The following ratios A:B were obtained for the 10 radionuclides addressed here: 241Am, 0.13; 207Bi, 0.57; 234U, 0.81; 239Pu, 0.96; 203Hg (vapor), 1.4; 134Cs, 1.5; 54Mn, 1.7; 210Po, 1.7; 226Ra, 1.9; 210Pb, 3.3. These ratios indicate that a dose estimate for brain based on a biokinetic model with brain implicitly contained in Other tissue may substantially underestimate or substantially overestimate a dose estimate that reflects best available brain-specific biokinetic data. Of course, the reliability of the latter estimate depends on the quality of the underlying biokinetic data.CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, the brain should be depicted explicitly in biokinetic models used in epidemiological studies addressing adverse effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded

The main pathological feature of AD is the deposition of misfolded beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) plaques in the brain.

Hence, studying the accumulation mechanism of Abeta in the brain and its effect on other tissues is of great significance for the early diagnosis of AD. The current clinical studies of Abeta accumulation mainly rely on medical imaging techniques, which have some deficiencies in sensitivity and specificity.

Myelopathy is considered acute when the symptoms progress to their nadir in maximum 21 days after onset. Due to heterogeneity in pathogenesis, and the overlap in the clinical and imaging presentation among etiologies, acute myelopathy is considered as a diagnostic dilemma. A simple and efficient algorithm for timely identification of the underlying cause is thus useful.

The objective of this review is to identify the gravity-sensing components of the vestibular system and to present an overview of the research performed on their development.

Furthermore, these recordings show that PI is attributable to intrinsic features of this GABAergic innervation. Implementation of these physiological findings into a neuronal model of the auditory brainstem demonstrates that, on a circuit level, PI creates an enhancement of responsiveness to lagging sounds in auditory midbrain cells. Moreover, the model revealed that such response enhancement is a sufficient cue for an ideal observer to identify echoes and to exhibit echo suppression, which agrees closely with the percepts of human subjects.",Excluded
3552,"Growth hormone deficiency amongst nasopharyngeal cancer survivors Introduction: Radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) places the pituitary particularly the somatotroph axis at risk of radiation damage. Our aim was to establish the prevalence growth hormone (GH) deficiency and other anterior pituitary dysfunction amongst NPC patients who had cranial irradiation and to determine predictive factors. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, we studied 58 patients (33 males) who had treatment for NPC more than 3 years ago and with no pre-existing hypothalamic-pituitary disorder from other causes. All patients had a complete anterior pituitary function test. Subsequently, the patients underwent dynamic testing with insulin tolerance test (ITT) to assess the somatotroph axis. Result(s): 43(75%) of patients had concurrent chemo-irradiation (CCRT) while 15 (25%) had radiotherapy alone. Median duration from therapy was 8 (3.0-33.0) years. Hypopituitarism was present in 84% of patients. GH deficiency was most common (80%) while corticotroph, gonadotroph and thyrotroph deficiencies were noted in 41,19 and 3% of the patients respectively. GH deficiency was significantly associated with duration from irradiation (9.9 years vs. 5 years, p<0.01) and the use of CCRT compared to those who had radiotherapy alone, OR: 9.5 (2.42-32.7), p<0.01. The mean peak GH response during ITT was inversely correlated with duration from irradiation (r=-0.29, p=0.04) and significantly attenuated in patients who had CCRT compared to radiotherapy alone (p=0.01 at 30 mins and p=0.02 at 60 mins). Conclusion(s): Pituitary mainly GH dysfunction post-NPC irradiation is widespread, and worsens with increasing duration from treatment and the use of CCRT. Since GH deficiency result in significant morbidity and mortality we recommend periodic assessment of pituitary/somatotroph function amongst NPC survivors.",Excluded
2624,"Locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Delivering neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to concurrent chemoradiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): The standard of care for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Patients with large tumors at presentation which are close to dose-limiting structures such as the optic chiasm and brain stem may pose a challenging clinical problem. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) prior to CRT can be used to shrink the tumor and may therefore be a valuable strategy to optimize treatment planning. Studies in Asia have reported favorable outcomes with NC for NPC. The goal of this study was to characterize the patterns of use of NC for NPC at a Canadian center. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of locally advanced NPC patients treated between 2000 and 2013. Patients who received NC with the intention to downsize locally advanced tumors prior to CRT were included. Baseline demographics, chemotherapy, radiation therapy treatments, and follow-up data were obtained from institutional databases and chart review and analyzed with SPSS. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), progression-free survival (PFS), local regional relapse-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival functions. Result(s): Forty-six patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 47 (range 18-75). Eighty percent of patients were male, 74% were of Asian ethnicity, and 87% had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Ninetyfour percent of patients had T3 or T4 tumors; 80% were node positive; 26% stage III, 67% IVA, 4% IVB. NC regimens included cisplatin/gemcitabine 87%, cisplatin/fluorouracil 6%, and cisplatin/etoposide 6%. The total neoadjuvant dose of cisplatin received ranged from 24mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 325 mg/m<sup>2</sup> with a median dose of 160mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The most common dose fractionations prescribed were 70 Gy in 35fractions for 67% of cases and 66 Gy in 33 fractions for 13%. Forty-two of the 46 patients went on to receive CRT, and the total concurrent cisplatin dose delivered was <200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 21 patients (46%) and >200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 25 patients (54%). In multivariate analysis of the 42 patients who received concurrent chemotherapy, the ability to deliver over 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> concurrent chemotherapy with radiation was not impacted by the dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, age, sex, ECOG, or ethnicity. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (0.17-10.6 years). Twenty-three percent of patients had a local recurrence, 13% developed distant metastases, and there were 7 deaths, 6 deaths due to NPC. The 3- year PFS was 67%, LRFS 74%, DMFS 86%, DSS 86%, and OS was 83%. Conclusion(s): NPC patients have been treated with NC at this center with favorable outcomes. Most patients tolerated CRT after NC, and half of patients received 5 or more concurrent cycles. The dose of NC given did not lower the dose concurrent chemotherapy later tolerated. This institution is currently evaluating the volumetric impact of NC on tumor size while we await the results of ongoing randomized trials of NC followed by CRT in this patient population.",Excluded

2509,"Orientin protects neuronal cell line from hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative damage via up-regulating nrf2/keap1 redox signalling pathways Introduction: Orientin is a water-soluble flavonoid C-glycoside which is isolable from Ocimum sanctum. It has been suggested to have antioxidant, antiviral, vasodilatation, cardioprotective, radiation protective effect, neuroprotective effect and to be able to cross blood-brain-barrier. Thus, it is a potential treatment or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Furthermore, oxidative stress has been highly implicated in the progression of ND, hence, this leads to the study on Nrf2/Keap1 redox signalling pathway for the targeted effective therapies of ND in the future. Objective(s): To determine the effects of orientin on nitric oxide levels, intracellular calcium levels and the mechanism by which orientin protects SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced oxidative damage. Method(s): Orientin at pre-determined maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD), 20 muM and half MNTD (O MNTD), 10muM were subjected to SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h, followed by 150 muM of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> oxidative induction for 24 h at 37degreeC. The Griess assay and Fluo-4 NW calcium assay were then performed to measure the NO levels and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by a microplate reader respectively. The regulation of Nrf2/Keap1 redox signalling pathway was analysed by Western blotting. Result(s): MNTD and O MNTD significantly reduced NO levels and significantly reduced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by 33.49% and 28.20% when compare to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> treatment alone. The regulation of Nrf2/Keap1 redox signalling pathway was confirmed by Western blotting.

2970,"Hedgehog signaling sensitizes glioma stem cells to endogenous nano-irradiation Objectives Existence of therapy resistant glioma stem cells (GSC) is responsible for the high recurrence rate and incurability of glioblastomas. The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activity plays an essential role for self-renewal capacity and survival of GSC. Since these cells are supposed to be the source of tumor recurrence, a new paradigm targeting high resistant dormant GSC may provide a novel therapeutic model for malignant brain cancers. Thus, we examined the potential of the Sonic Hh ligand for sensitizing of GSC to endogenous nanoirradiation. Methods Primary GM cells were phenotyped using GSC markers by microscopy. GSC were isolated using CD133 microbeads. Existence and activity of Hh pathway was examined by SDS-PAGE and RT-PCR. For stimulation, GM cells and normal human astrocytes (NHA) were incubated with Shh (200 ng/ml for 5d) and with fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd, 1muM for 1h). Proliferation was determined by BrdU. Annexin-V visualized the apoptosis. Uptake and DNA incorporation of I-125-ITdU (250kBq/1*10^5 cells) were measured after 4d using gamma-counter. Killing efficiency was defined by means of intrinsic caspases activation and clonogenic survival. Results Sonic Hh ligand preferentially and efficiently activated GSC to enter the radiation sensitive G2/M phase. Concomitant inhibition with FdUrd and treatment with the Auger electron emitting thymidine analogue [I-125]ITdU led to fatal nano-irradiation in sensitized GCS. Targeting of proliferating GCS with DNA-incorporated [I-125]ITdU efficiently invoked the intrinsic apoptotic pathway despite active DNA repair mechanisms. Further, [I-125]ITdU completely inhibited survival of GCS. Analysis of non-stem glioblastoma cells and NHA revealed that GCS differentially responded to Sonic Hh ligand. Conclusions These data demonstrate a highly efficient and controllable singlecell kill therapeutic model for targeting glioma stem cells.",Excluded
2540,"Preclinical radiotherapy at the Australian Synchrotron's Imaging and Medical Beamline: instrumentation, dosimetry and a small-animal feasibility study Therapeutic applications of synchrotron X-rays such as microbeam (MRT) and minibeam (MBRT) radiation therapy promise significant advantages over conventional clinical techniques for some diseases if successfully transferred to clinical practice. Preclinical studies show clear evidence that a number of normal tissues in animal models display a tolerance to much higher doses from MRT compared with conventional radiotherapy. However, a wide spread in the parameters studied makes it difficult to make any conclusions about the associated tumour control or normal tissue complication probabilities. To facilitate more systematic and reproducible preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies, a dedicated preclinical station including small-animal irradiation stage was designed and installed at the Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) at the Australian Synchrotron. The stage was characterized in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the vertical scanning speed, as this is the key variable in dose delivery. The measured speed was found to be within 1% of the nominal speed for the range of speeds measured by an interferometer. Furthermore, dose measurements confirm the expected relationship between speed and dose and show that the measured dose is independent of the scan direction. Important dosimetric parameters such as peak dose, valley dose, the collimator output factor and peak-to-valley dose ratio are presented for 5 mm x 5 mm, 10 mm x 10 mm and 20 mm x 20 mm field sizes. Finally, a feasibility study on three glioma-bearing rats was performed. MRT and MBRT doses were prescribed to achieve an average dose of 65 Gy in the target, and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up was performed at various time points after irradiation to follow the tumour volume. Although it is impossible to draw conclusions on the different treatments with such a small number of animals, the feasibility of end-to-end preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies using the IMBL preclinical stage is demonstrated.",Excluded
2940,"CT dose audit 2009-2014: Pre-and post Arpansa NDRL Introduction Since the inception of NDRL in Australia in 2011, CT dose optimisation continues to be a key focus in patient dose management. At Austin Health, we decided to perform a CT dose audit to review the CT dose trend and the effect NDRL has had at this practice. Method Retrospective data collection of CTDIvol and DLP values of procedures for 2 years prior to NDRL and 3 years post NDRL were taken. The following non-contrast procedures were audited, CT brain, CT chest, CT abdomen/pelvis and CT chest/abdomen/pelvis scans. Data was collected across 4 CT scanners and their median of the spread per year was taken as the facility reference level (FRL) as defined in the Arpansa National Diagnostic Reference Level Service Fact Sheet. The FRL was then compared with the NDRL values. Results Preliminary results indicate a dose reduction over time since 2009 for most procedures, which may be attributed to dose optimisation, CT technology and the establishment of NDRL as a benchmark for CT dose comparison. Conclusion Regular CT dose audits are useful in managing dose trends and dose optimisation. It can be seen that since the implementation of the NDRL in 2011, there has been a positive trend towards lowering radiation dose associated with CT at this facility.",Excluded
3235,"Optimal arc selection from class solution geometries for solitary intra-cranial radiotherapy Objectives: Preliminary planning at our institution using HyperArcTM (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA) identified the optimal beam energy of 10 MVFFF. Evidence suggests that single target plans do not require as many arcs as single isocentre, multiple target plans but there are trade-offs.1,2 The aim of this study was to determine the optimal arc selection from HyperArcs class solution beam geometries for post-surgical cavities for stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Method(s): For 16 retrospective solitary post-surgical cavity cases, HyperArc plans comprising different arc geometries were generated. Prescribed dose for all plans was 24 Gy in 3 fractions with D99% >= utilising 10 MVFFF. Metrics analysed including indices: CI100 RTOG, CI50 RTOG, CI Paddick, GI Paddick, HI (ICRU 83) and plan complexity using modulation factor (MF) (MU/dose per fraction in cGy) comparing default arc selection versus varying arc selections. Result(s): The mean CI100 RTOG for default arc selection was 1.10 (1.03-1.25) compared to 1.11 (1.05-1.24) for the comparison plans. The mean CI50 RTOG for default arc selection was 3.24 (2.70-5.44) compared to 3.25 (2.79-4.46) for the comparison plans. The mean MF for default arc selection was 2.74 (2.40-3.40) compared to 2.76 (2.40-4.00) for the comparison plans. Results from the complete analysis to be presented with additional metrics. Discussion/Conclusion: Analysis highlighted minimal differences when comparing default arc selection to varying arc selection. Due to no clear benefit for either groups of plans, consideration in the decision making was given to both treatment time and isocentre verification at individual couch angles. Therefore, minimising arc angles for solitary intra-cranial lesions was the preferred option.",Excluded

2560,"Adjuvant treatment of brain metastases With an incidence of 15/10<sup>5</sup> in the general population, brain metastases constitute a serious, debilitating complication in cancer patients. The majority of those patients suffer from more than one metastasis, but up to 30% to 40% present with a solitary lesion. Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) extends median survival from 1 to 2 months for treatment with steroids only, to 4 to 6 months in most series. However, long-term survival (>1-2 years) is observed in up to 10% of patients with favorable prognostic factors, such as solitary lesions, good Karnofsky performance status, and absence of extracranial disease. For those patients, individually optimized treatment is worthwhile. For good-prognosis patients with controlled extracranial disease, surgery in combination with postoperative WBRT should be considered, especially when fast relief of symptoms is mandated. For surgically inaccessible solitary lesions below a size threshold of approximately 30 ccm, stereotactic radiosurgery (RS), although never compared to surgery in a randomized fashion, seems to yield comparable results and is the treatment of choice for more than one lesion in appropriately selected patients. Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning the optimal treatment regimens for brain metastases remain. These mainly concern the radiation dose, need for a combination of RS and WBRT, relative timing of different treatment modalities, and maximum number of brain metastases that can reasonably be treated with RS when long-term progression-free survival is the goal. However, RS is definitely an excellent option for salvage and palliation in patients with short life expectancy, as it is simultaneously noninvasive and cost-effective, with short hospitalization times. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
3127,"[Experimental data for administration of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for prevention of radiation myelopathy] BACKGROUND: Current models of radiation myelopathy provide a rationale for growth factor-based prevention strategies. Thus, we tested whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) alone or in combination modulate radiation tolerance of the rat cervical spinal cord.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cervical spinal cord of 68 adult Fisher F344 rats received a total dose of 30-36 Gy, given as a single fraction of 16 Gy followed by a second radiation dose of 14-20 Gy. Continuous intrathecal infusion of bFGF (44 rats) or saline (24 rats) into the cisterna magna was given concomitantly. A further experiment included 14 additional rats which were treated with subcutaneous injection of IGF-1 parallel to irradiation with a total dose of 34 Gy or 36 Gy. 20 rats received combined treatment, i.e. intrathecal infusion of bFGF plus subcutaneous injection of IGF-1, starting 24 hours before irradiation (total dose 33 Gy or 36 Gy) for a total of 4 days. Animals were followed until myelopathy developed or for a maximum of 12 months. Histopathologic examinations were performed post mortem.RESULTS: Treatment with bFGF alone or IGF-1 alone increased the median time to myelopathy significantly. In the 36-Gy group, after combination treatment a comparable prolongation of latency was seen. Moreover, rats treated with 33 Gy and combined bFGF plus IGF-1 showed a significantly reduced risk of myelopathy, too (p = 0.0015, Figures 1 and 2).CONCLUSION: Combination of IGF-1 and bFGF was more potent than single agent treatment. We observed a significantly reduced myelopathy rate at an intermediate radiation dose level and a longer time to myelopathy at a high-dose level. This finding strengthens the evidence that brief therapeutic intervention can decrease radiation-induced neurotoxicity. Further studies will be undertaken to optimize this strategy.",Excluded

Despite advances in microsurgery, tentorial meningiomas continue to challenge surgeons and patients. To evaluate the response of tentorial meningiomas, we evaluated 41 patients who had Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery during a 9 year period. Patient age varied from 32 to 79 years. Headache, trigeminal neuralgia, or facial paraesthesia were the most common presenting symptoms. Sensory deficits in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve were the most common finding.

2734,"Significant reduction of beta-amyloid in the CNS following external radiation: Implications for treatment in alzheimer's disease Purpose/Objective(s): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent form of dementia in the elderly population, is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau protein tangles. These events are especially prevalent in the hippocampus region which is responsible for long term memory. In this animal study, we investigated if cranial X-irradiation could reduce the formation of Ab plaques as a potential novel clinical treatment for Alzheimer's disease, the rationale being that external beam radiotherapy has been used previously as an effective clinical treatment for systemic amyloidosis. Materials/Methods: A transgenic mouse model was used that expresses a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) both directed to CNS neurons. Both mutations are associated with early-onset AD. Radiation treatments were either a single dose (5 Gy, 10 Gy or 15 Gy) or daily fractionation (1 Gy, 2 Gy) to a dose of 10 Gy to a single side of the head. Brains were harvested at various times post-irradiation (2-8 wks) and coronal sections were evaluated for H&E and antibody specific immunohistochemistry to detect beta-amyloid plaques and assess radiation response, staining for IL1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, microglia cells (CD11b) and activated microglia cells (CD68). Result(s): Radiation treatments were well-tolerated. H&E stained tissue sections indicated no evidence of a significant decrease in cell density (Nissl staining) and no compelling evidence of significant cellular necrosis. No signs of devitalization, malacia or spongiosus or classic acute or chronic inflammatory features were evident. The number and size of beta-amyloid plaques were compared between the irradiated and shielded halves of the brain. The average number of plaques in the unirradiated brain increased with age, the values for 32, 34 and 38 week old animals were 43.9 (SD +/- 17.6; n = 9), 61.7 (SD +/- 19.8, n = 9) and 109 (SD +/- 26.9, n = 9) respectively. Radiation treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction of plaques throughout the brain (paired t-test p = 0.002).This effect was more significant in the hippocampus region (p = 0.0004). At 4 weeks post-treatment 5, 10 and 15 Gy caused a 71 +/- 3%, 87 +/- 24%, 92 +/- 34% reduction in plaque incidence in the hippocampus. The greatest reductions were noted at longer times post-treatment. TGF-beta staining was restricted to the irradiated side of the brain, little or no site-specific staining of IL1 or TNF-alpha was seen. A trend was evident of activated microglia in the irradiated brain.

2460,"Spatial distribution of brain microhemorrhage resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) Introduction Microhemorrhages, commonly found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of TBI, appear as punctuate hypointense foci on susceptibility weighted images (SWI). To better understand the spatial distribution of microhemorrhages, we map their locations to a normalized space and apply region of interest (ROI) analysis using brain atlases. Methods MRI was performed in a series of 46 sequential patients enrolled in a natural history study of TBI. Susceptibility weighted (TR = 64ms, TE = 25ms, FA = 20degree, 0.49 x 0.49 x 2.0 mm) and 3D T1-MPRAGE (TR = 25ms, TE = 3.03ms, FA = 7degree, 1 x 1 x 1 mm) images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Biograph mMR in all patients. SWI images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist on a Carestream PACS workstation, and microhemorrhages were labeled using the ""marker"" graphic tool. To characterize their spatial distribution in standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, the T1-MPRAGE was affine registered to the MNI template. This transformation was applied to the co-registered SWI images and to the marker coordinates. The frequency of microhemorrhages in major brain structures was determined from ROIs using the digital Talairach brain atlas. Similarly, the frequency of microhemorrhage in labeled white matter (WM) tracts was performed by applying the Diffusion Oriented Tract Segmentation method to the image within MNI space. Results A total of 629 microhemorrhages were identified. An average of 13 +/- 34 (range = 1 +/- 179) microhemorrhages were present in the 24 positive patients out of all 46 cases. Microhemorrhages congregated around the periphery of the brain and were symmetrically distributed. Using Talairach ROI analysis, microhemorrhages were most prevalent in the frontal lobes 60% (377). The remaining lobar distribution was temporal: 10% (63), parietal 1.3% (8), occipital: 4.7% (30), limbic: 3.6% (23). Sublobar distribution was brainstem: 1.4% (9), cerebellum: 4.8% (31), deep cerebral WM: 6.8% (43), thalamus and basal ganglia: 1.3% (8). Microhemorrhages in WM tracts contributed 61% (384) in total. Restricting the analysis to WM tracts, microhemorrhages were primarily found in the corpus callosum 40.3% (253). Other WM tracts with notable proportions ( > 4%) include the anterior thalamic radiation: 4.3% (27), cortico-pontine tract: 4.4% (28), inferior frontooccipital fasciculus: 13.4% (84), inferior longitudinal fasciculus: 5.5% (35), middle cerebellar peduncle 9.1% (57), superior fronto-occipital fasciculus 8% (50), and uncinate fasciculus 4.4% (28). We note, however, that because white matter tracts are relatively small structures and the alignment was performed using only an affine transformation, these results should be considered as preliminary. Conclusions This study examines the spatial distribution of microhemorrhages in 24 TBI patients. Microhemorrhages were distributed mostly around the periphery of the brain, and were particularly common in the frontal lobes. Such a finding is likely due to many of these injuries resulting from motor vehicle accidents, possibly with head-on collisions. In the WM tract analysis, the corpus callosum was implicated as a WM pathway that may be vulnerable to damage. Future work will expand the analysis to additional subjects, as well as examine distribution differences between impact and blast injuries. The relationship between microhemorrhage location and neurobehavioral symptoms requires further study.",Excluded
2524,"Quantitative characterization of nuclear overhauser enhancement and amide proton transfer effects in the human brain at 7 tesla PURPOSE: This study aimed to quantitatively investigate two main magnetization transfer effects at low B1: the nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) and amide proton transfer in the human brain at 7 T.METHODS: The magnetization transfer effects in the human brain were characterized using a four-pool proton model, which consisted of bulk water, macromolecules, an amide group of mobile proteins and peptides, and NOE-related protons resonating upfield. The pool sizes, exchange rates, and relaxation times of these proton pools were investigated quantitatively by fitting, and the net signals of amide proton transfer and NOE were simulated based on the fitted parameters.RESULTS: The results showed that the four-pool model fitted the experimental data quite well, and the NOE effects in human brain at 7 T had a broad spectrum distribution. The NOE effects peaked at a B1 of ~ 1-1.4 muT and were significantly stronger in the white matter than in the gray matter, corresponding to a pool-size ratio ~ 2:1. As the amide proton transfer effect was relatively small compared with the NOE effects, magnetization transfer asymmetry analysis yielded an NOE-dominated contrast in the healthy human brain in this range of B1.CONCLUSION: These findings are important to identify the source of NOE effects and to quantify amide proton transfer effects in human brain at 7 T.",Excluded
3307,"Blocking GABAA neurotransmission in the interposed nuclei: effects on conditioned and unconditioned eyeblinks The interposed nuclei (IN) of the intermediate cerebellum are critical components of the circuits that control associative learning of eyeblinks and other defensive reflexes in mammals. The IN, which represent the sole output of the intermediate cerebellum, receive massive GABAergic input from Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex and are thought to contribute to the acquisition and performance of classically conditioned eyeblinks. The specific role of deep cerebellar nuclei and the cerebellar cortex in eyeblink conditioning are not well understood. One group of studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN altered the time profile of conditioned responses (CRs), suggesting that the main function of the cerebellar cortex is to shape the timing of CRs. Other studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN abolished CRs, indicating a more fundamental involvement of the cerebellar cortex in CR generation. When examining this controversy, we hypothesized that the behavioral effect of GABA(A) blockers could be dose-dependent. The IN of classically conditioned rabbits were injected with high and low doses of picrotoxin and gabazine. Both GABA(A) blockers produced tonic eyelid closure. A high dose of both drugs abolished CRs, whereas a less complete block of GABA(A)-mediated inputs with substantially smaller drug doses shortened CR latencies. In addition, low doses of picrotoxin facilitated the expression of unconditioned eyeblinks evoked by trigeminal stimulation. These results suggest that the intermediate cerebellum regulates both associative and non-associative components of the eyeblink reflex, and that behavioral effects of blocking Purkinje cell action on IN neurons are related to collective changes in cerebellar signals and in the excitability of extra-cerebellar eyeblink circuits.",Excluded

The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of medical microbeam irradiation using the ESRF synchrotron at Grenoble to the right brain hemisphere of the rat to determine whether abscopal effects could be produced in the rest of the animal and also in cage mates housed with it. The results show strong signal production in the contralateral brain hemisphere with less strong effects in the distant bladder of the irradiated rats. Signal strength was the same or stronger in the cage mates housed for 48 hrs with the irradiated rats. The proteomic study showed that the abscopal-associated proteins included A. an increase in the expression of NADH dehydrogenase, aconitase, ubiquinone and Glial fibrillary acid proteins, which are known to be present in gliomas, B. a reduction of the Prohibitin protein, which is thought to be a tumor suppressor in humans C. an increase on the expression of Heat shock cognate 71kDa protein, which is known to be involved in the disassembly of clarithin-coated vesicles and D. a decrease in the expression of Tubulin alpha-1A chain protein, which is known to be one of the major components of microtubules. All of these proteins would suggest a pro-carcinogenesis proteome. However in the cage mates, tubulin and aconitase were present but in different isoforms, HSP 71 was also induced. Significantly, pyruvate kinase, fructose biphosphate and aldolase were also present, suggesting mobilization of energy reserves. This also happened in the bystander fish. One brain specific protein which was suppressed in the cage mate brain is dihydropyrimidinase. This protein is prone to oxidation and the oxidised molecule is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A reduction could be seen as beneficial in terms of reducing the overall extent of oxidased dihydropyrimidinase. On the other hand dihydropyrimidinase is a vital neurotransmitter so a reduction could also be seen as detrimental to cognitive brain function. Whatever way the induced changes in the cage mates influence the health of the animals, it is very clear that proximity to an irradiated animal induces proteomic changes in an unirradiated partner. The transmitting agent in fish and rats is thought to be urine. If similar signaling occurs between humans, the results could have implications for caregivers and hospital staff treating radiotherapy patients.",Included
3187,"Cerenkov luminescence imaging with PET probes for brain function analysis Objectives Optical imaging has advantages in its easy-to-use feature. However, brain imaging is not easy in optical molecular imaging, since the molecular sizes of fluorescent probes are usually too large to penetrate the bloodbrain- barrier. On the other hands, PET imaging is superior in quantitative analysis, and many brain imaging probes are available. Cerenkov radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as a positron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of CLI for the analysis of brain functions using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG, [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Methods For [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG imaging, the mice were separated into two groups. For one group, the hair of the mice were shaved (w/o hair), and for other group, the skull was additionally removed (w/o hair & skull). [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (3 MBq, iv) was injected to each group of the mice, and PET imaging was performed from 30 to 60 min after the injection. Then, Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) was done for 10 min from just after the PET imaging. After in vivo CLI, the brain was removed and ex vivo CLI was performed. Then, the radioactivity of the brain was measured by a gamma-counter. Various fasting times were set for each mouse in order to produce various blood sugar levels. For [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride imaging, the mice (w/o hair) were injected with 7.4 MBq of the tracer, and sequential 8-min CLI (followed by 2-min interval) was performed from 8-10 min after the injection. In vivo blocking study was done by treating the mice with haloperidol. Also, the images were obtained by [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Results In [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG studies, there was a good relationship between the radioactivity and CLI signal in removed brains (r=0.93). The good correlation was observed in w/o hair & skull group (r=0.92). The correlation was weaker in w/o hair group (r=0.74), but it thought to be acceptable for the analysis in mice. The striatum was successfully visualized by [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Luminescence in the striatum was decreased by haloperidol treatment. Since the brain uptake of [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT was higher than [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride, [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT produced more clearer images in CLI. Conclusions Optical imaging was possible with PET imaging probes. Although both quantitativity and sensitivity are inferior to PET imaging, it is possible to use CRI for brain function analysis in mice.",Excluded
2744,Effect of hypothalamic stimulation on lactate- and malate dehydrogenase activities in rat cardiac muscle. [Russian] The activity of lactic and malic dehydrogenases was examined in the rat heart after stimulation of the hypothalamus. The activity of LDG and MDG was increased after stimulation of the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and decreased after stimulation of the ventromedial nuclei. Both effects were abolished by preliminary injection of actinomycin D. This finding suggests an important role of heart cells' genetic apparatus in the neurohormonal regulation of the heart metabolism.,Excluded
3499,"Multiple cone pathways are involved in photic regulation of retinal dopamine Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the retina and plays a central role in the light adaptive processes of the visual system. The sole source of retinal dopamine is dopaminergic amacrine cells (DACs). We and others have previously demonstrated that DACs are activated by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) upon illumination. However, it is still not clear how each class of photosensitive cells generates light responses in DACs. We genetically isolated cone function in mice to specifically examine the cone-mediated responses of DACs and their neural pathways. In addition to the reported excitatory input to DACs from light-increment (ON) bipolar cells, we found that cones alternatively signal to DACs via a retrograde signalling pathway from ipRGCs. Cones also produce ON and light-decrement (OFF) inhibitory responses in DACs, which are mediated by other amacrine cells, likely driven by type 1 and type 2/3a OFF bipolar cells, respectively. Dye injections indicated that DACs had similar morphological profiles with or without ON/OFF inhibition. Our data demonstrate that cones utilize specific parallel excitatory and inhibitory circuits to modulate DAC activity and efficiently regulate dopamine release and the light-adaptive state of the retina.",Excluded
2611,"The effect of exposure to 60Co accelerated electrons and gamma quanta on the activity of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes in the rat brain. [Russian] In experiments with 112 male Wistar rats it was shown that accelerated electrons (85 Gy) caused a significant increase in activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDG) by 15.8% and lactate dehydrogenase (LDG) by 17.0%, and a decrease in activities of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) by 10.6 and 7.8% respectively within the sensorimotor region of the cerebral cortex immediately after irradiation. Activity of SDG and MAO decreased (by 16.4% and 7.8% respectively) in the caudate nucleus over the same period of time. An increase in the accelerated electron dose from 85 to 500 Gy did not change the direction and the rate of the radiation response of the enzymes. Exposure of rats to 60Co gamma quanta (75 Gy) increased SDG and LDG activity (by 21.4 and 17.3% respectively) within the sensorimotor cortex as late as 10 min after irradiation. A repeated significant increase in SDG and LDG activity was observed 2 hr after irradiation.",Included
3106,"Microwave irradiation of rats at 2.45 GHz activates pinocytotic-like uptake of tracer by capillary endothelial cells of cerebral cortex Far-field exposures of male albino rats to 2.45-GHz microwaves (10-microseconds pulses, 100 pps) at a low average power density (10 mW/cm2; SAR approximately 2 W/kg) and short durations (30-120 min) resulted in increased uptakes of tracer through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The uptake of systemically administered rhodamine-ferritin complex by capillary endothelial cells (CECs) of the cerebral cortex was dependent on power density and on duration of exposure. At 5 mW/cm2, for example, a 15-min exposure had no effect. Near-complete blockade of uptake resulted when rats were treated before exposure to microwaves with a single dose of colchicine, which inhibits microtubular function. A pinocytotic-like mechanism is presumed responsible for the microwave-induced increase in BBB permeability.",Excluded
3034,"Lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR): dosimetric considerations for chest wall toxicity OBJECTIVE: To investigate chest wall pain in patients with peripheral early stage lung cancer treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), and to identify factors predictive of Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events Grade 2 + chest wall pain.METHODS: Patients who received 55 Gy in five fractions were included. A chest wall structure was retrospectively defined on planning scans, and chest wall dosimetry and tumour-related factors recorded. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors predictive of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain.RESULTS: 182 patients and 187 tumours were included. There were 20 (10.9%) episodes of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that the maximum dose received by 1 cm(3) of chest wall (Dmax1 cm(3)) and tumour size were significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain [Dmax1 cm(3) odds ratio : 1.104, 95% confidence interval : 1.012-1.204, p = 0.025; tumour size (mm) odds ratio : 1.080, 95% confidence interval : 1.026-1.136, p = 0.003]. This model was an adequate fit to the data (Hosmer and Lemeshow test non-significant) and a fair discriminator for chest wall pain (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.74). Using the multivariate logistic regression model, parameters for Dmax1 cm(3) are provided, which predict <10% and <20% risks of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain for different tumour sizes.CONCLUSION: Grade 2+ chest wall pain is an uncommon side effect of lung SABR. Larger tumour size and increasing Dmax1 cm(3) are significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. When planning lung SABR, it is prudent to try to avoid hot volumes in the chest wall, particularly for larger tumours.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article demonstrates that Grade 2 or greater chest wall pain following lung SABR is more common when the tumour is larger in size and the Dmax1 cm(3) of the chest wall is higher. When planning lung SABR, the risk of chest wall pain may be reduced if maximum doses are minimized, particularly for larger tumours.",Excluded
3040,"[Pro- and antioxidant effect of electromagnetic fields of extremely high frequency (460 MHz) on brain tissues in experiment] The article concerns biological effects of non-ionized electromagnetic irradiation which is considered in modern world as a serious ecological factor. Influence of decimetric microwave irradiation (460 MHz) on free radical processes in the rat brain tissues--visual cortex and hypothalamus--were investigated. Oxidative effects of both lipid peroxidation and specific activity of glutathione reductase were determined. It is shown that whole body irradiation for up to 4 weeks results in considerable changes of the above indices dependent on the irradiation intensity and age of the animals. Decimetric microwaves have oxidant effects at high intensity irradiation (SAR--15 mW/kg), while these effects are antioxidant at low intensity (SAR--5 mW/kg). Physiological implications of different oxidative metabolic responses of the hypothalamus and the cortex to microwaves irradiation are discussed.",Excluded
2791,"X-ray fluorescence microscopy reveals accumulation and secretion of discrete intracellular zinc pools in the lactating mouse mammary gland BACKGROUND: The mammary gland is responsible for the transfer of a tremendous amount of zinc ( approximately 1-3 mg zinc/day) from maternal circulation into milk during lactation to support the growth and development of the offspring. When this process is compromised, severe zinc deficiency compromises neuronal development and immune function and increases infant morbidity and/or mortality. It remains unclear as to how the lactating mammary gland dynamically integrates zinc import from maternal circulation with the enormous amount of zinc that is secreted into milk.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Herein we utilized X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) which allowed for the visualization and quantification of the process of zinc transfer through the mammary gland of the lactating mouse. Our data illustrate that a large amount of zinc first accumulates in the mammary gland during lactation. Interestingly, this zinc is not cytosolic, but accumulated in large, discrete sub-cellular compartments. These zinc pools were then redistributed to small intracellular vesicles destined for secretion in a prolactin-responsive manner. Confocal microscopy identified mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus as the sub-cellular compartments which accumulate zinc; however, zinc pools in the Golgi apparatus, but not mitochondria are redistributed to vesicles destined for secretion during lactation.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data directly implicate the Golgi apparatus in providing a large, mobilizable zinc storage pool to assist in providing for the tremendous amount of zinc that is secreted into milk. Interestingly, our study also provides compelling evidence that mitochondrial zinc pools expand in the mammary gland during lactation which we speculate may play a role in regulating mammary gland function.",Excluded
3379,"Reduced-dose radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas OBJECTIVE: To evaluate tumor control and complications associated with low-dose radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas. METHOD(S): Between December 1993 and January 2000, 47 patients with vestibular schwannomas were treated at our center with gamma knife radiosurgery. The marginal tumor doses ranged from 7.5 to 14.0 Gy (median, 12.0 Gy) for patients treated after microsurgery and from 10.0 to 15.0 Gy (median, 12.0 Gy) for patients in whom radiosurgery was the primary treatment. The median maximum tumor diameter was 18 mm (range, 3-50 mm). Evaluation included audiometry, neurological examination, and serial imaging tests. A survey was conducted at the time of analysis. RESULT(S): Follow-up data were available for 45 patients and ranged from 1 to 7 years (median, 3.6 yr). In 43 patients (96%), tumor control (no radiographic progression or surgical resection) was observed. All 33 previously untreated patients had tumor control. Transient facial weakness, experienced in two patients (4%), had resolved completely within 6 months. No patient developed trigeminal neuropathy. Hearing was diminished from baseline in 12% of patients with useful hearing (Gardner-Robertson Class III). However, all patients with pretreatment hearing Gardner-Robertson Class I or II maintained testable hearing (Class I to III) at the most recent examination. CONCLUSION(S): Low-dose radiosurgery in this series provided comparable local control and decreased incidences of complications in relation to other reports. Additional follow-up will allow more definitive conclusions to be reached regarding the ultimate rates of tumor control and hearing preservation. Nevertheless, the current dose used for vestibular schwannomas at the University of Maryland Medical Center is 12.0 Gy to the tumor periphery.",Excluded
2814,"Evaluating DNA damage in rodent brain after acute 60 Hz magnetic-field exposure In recent years, numerous studies have reported a weak association between 60 Hz magnetic-field exposure and the incidence of certain cancers. To date, no mechanism to explain these findings has been identified. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether acute magnetic-field exposure could elicit DNA damage within brain cells from both whole brain and cerebellar homogenates from adult rats, adult mice and immature mice. Rodents were exposed to a 60 Hz magnetic field (0, 0.1, 1 or 2 mT) for 2 h. Then, at 0, 2 and 4 h after exposure, animals were killed humanely, their brains were rapidly removed and homogenized, and cells were cast into agarose gels for processing by the alkaline comet assay. Four parameters (tail ratio, tail moment, comet length and tail length) were used to assess DNA damage for each comet. For each species, a significant increase in DNA damage was detected by each of the four parameters in the positive control (2 Gy X rays) relative to the concurrent nonirradiated negative and sham controls. However, none of the four parameters detected a significant increase in DNA damage in brain cell homogenates from any magnetic-field exposure (0- 2 mT) at any time after exposure. The dose-response and time-course data from the multiple animal groups tested in this study provide no evidence of magnetic-field-induced DNA damage.",Excluded

We found that male ICR white Swiss mice exhibiting isolation-induced aggression became gradually calm and showed remarkably quiet behavior 7 to 10 days after whole body irradiation of very low-dose X-rays (5-15 cGy). Higher doses (25-35 cGy), however, could not induce such effects. We also obtained the data on brain biochemistry giving a further support for the above low-dose effects on the mouse behavior. Brain serotonin turnover which has been known to be related to aggressive behavior in 5 or 15 cGy irradiated mice was faster than in aggressive control animals.",Included
2741,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone-mediated pathway of leptin to regulate feeding, adiposity, and uncoupling protein expression in mice To examine the functional role of CRH in the regulation of energy homeostasis by leptin, we measured the effects of the CRH antagonist, alpha-helical CRH 8-41 (alphaCRH) on a number of factors affected by leptin activity. These included food intake, body weight, hypothalamic c-fos-like immunoreactivity (c-FLI), weight and histological characterization of white adipose tissue, and mRNA expressions of uncoupling protein (UCP) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in C57Bl/6 mice. Central infusion of leptin into the lateral cerebroventricle (icv) caused significant induction of c-FLI in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, and arcuate nucleus. In all these nuclei, the effect of leptin on expression of cFLI in the PVN and VMH was decreased by treatment with alphaCRH. Administration of leptin markedly decreased cumulative food intake and body weight with this effect being attenuated by pretreatment with alphaCRH. In peripheral tissue, leptin up-regulated BAT UCP1 mRNA expression and reduced fat depositions in this tissue. Those changes in BAT were also decreased by treatment with alphaCRH. As a consequence of the effects on food intake or energy expenditure, treatment with alphaCRH attenuated the leptin-induced reduction of body adiposity, fat cell size, triglyceride contents, and ob mRNA expression in white adipose tissue. Taken together, these results indicate that CRH neurons in the PVN and VMH may be an important mediator for leptin that contribute to regulation of feeding, adiposity, and UCP expression.",Excluded
2848,"A prospective study of thyroid function after radiotherapy for central nervous system and head and neck malignancies Purpose/Objective: Few studies evaluate endocrine gland function following radiotherapy (RT). We conducted a single-institution prospective study to understand the effect of RT on pituitary and thyroid function in adults. Material(s) and Method(s): Adult patients who received fractionated RT for non-metastatic head and neck cancer and benign intracranial neoplasms were eligible. Patients with a history of thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamic surgery or baseline hormonal supplementation were excluded. Baseline endocrine labs were obtained prior to RT and at 6- month intervals for 5 years. A dose-volume histogram report was generated for the hypothalamus, thyroid, and pituitary gland. Hypothyroidism (HT) was defined as TSH level > 5.0 mIU/L or T4 < 0.8 ng/dL. The primary endpoint was to establish the incidence and threshold dose for RT-related endocrine dysfunction. This interim analysis reports on thyroid function for the first 50 of a planned 200 patients enrolled. Result(s): From October 2006 to May 2008, 50 patients were enrolled with a median follow up of 67 months (range, 17-82 months). Forty-two patients were treated for head and neck (HN) cancers, and eight were treated for benign central nervous (CNS) tumors. No patient was on thyroid supplementation at baseline. The median prescription dose was 6000 cGy in 30 fractions (range, 4500-7000 cGy). Thirty-six patients (72%) were treated adjuvantly and 31 patients (62%) also received concurrent chemotherapy. Primary HT incidence was 60% (n=30) at a median of 12 months (range, 2.9-58.7). The 12-, 24-, 48-, and 60-month freedom from thyroid dysfunction was 78%, 52%, 47.5%, and 33.7%, respectively. Twenty-one patients (42%) received thyroid replacement therapy with a median time to therapy of 3.5 months after diagnosis of HT. The mean thyroid dose in patients with HT was 6136 cGy (range, 3958-6930) compared to 2825 cGy (range, 0-7032) for those without HT. The incidence of HT was 11% (n=2) vs. 87.5% (n=28) for patients with a mean thyroid dose below vs. above 5000 cGy, respectively (p<0.0001). No secondary HT was observed, and the mean pituitary dose for patients with HT was 1065 cGy. Significant risk factors for HT identified on univariate analysis included mean thyroid dose above 5000 cGy <0.0001), concurrent chemotherapy (p=0.029), and HN vs. CNS radiation (p=0.004). Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that patients who receive a mean thyroid dose > 5000 cGy are at increased risk for primary HT after RT. Median time to HT is 12 months, but can occur as early as 3 months post- RT. Routine regular laboratory assessment with prompt appropriate thyroid supplementation is recommended.",Excluded

3046,"Effects of external beam radiation in the rat tibial nerve after crush, transection and repair, or nerve isograft paradigms INTRODUCTION: In head and neck surgery, radiation therapy is often administered to an injured nerve. Previous studies have examined the effects of either preoperative or postoperative radiation on nerve regeneration in rodents. In these studies, histomorphometric analysis was performed up to 8 month postoperatively. Given the exceptional neuroregenerative capacity of rodents, significant differences in nerve regeneration may go undetected if nerves are evaluated at such distant postoperative time points. This study is designed with a more appropriate model and investigates the effects of radiation after three common nerve injury paradigms.METHODS: Sixty-four Lewis rates were randomized to 8 groups corresponding to uninjured, tibial nerve crush, transection and repair, or reconstruction with isografts. Half of the animals in each of these paradigms (n = 8 per group) were treated with 10 Gy of external beam radiation to the site of nerve injury at 7 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 28, functional recovery and histomorphometric assessment was performed.RESULTS: For a given paradigm of nerve injury, no significant differences in nerve fiber number, neural density, neural debris, or fiber width were noted between the control and radiated groups, and radiation did not affect functional recovery.CONCLUSION: Radiation had no discernible effect on nerve regeneration or functional recovery in the rodent nerve injury models studied. All assessments were made at time points suitable for detecting differences in nerve regeneration between groups. These findings suggest that administration of radiation to fields containing injured peripheral nerve is unlikely to adversely affect functional outcomes.",Included
3618,"Inhibition of IKK/NF-kappaB impairs glioma stem cell function Glioma, the most frequently occurring primary brain tumor, has a median survival of less than 15 months, despite multimodal treatment combining surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. It has been suggested that the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) within these tumors are responsible for resistance to treatment and high probability of recurrence. As a result, there is increasing interest in specifically targeting CSCs with new therapies to improve treatment of this disease. NF-kappaB has been implicated in numerous forms of cancer, as its target genes regulate hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Both glioma cell lines and tumor samples show high levels of phosphorylated p65, a marker of NF-kappaB activation. When comparing populations from tumor explants, NF-kappaB is preferentially activated in the CSC subset. We are examining the effects of IKK/NF-kappaB inhibition on both heterogeneous glioma explants and purified (CD133+) CSCs from these explants. Inhibition of NF-kappaB through either genetic or pharmacological means abrogates neurosphere formation, an in vitro measure of stem cell function. Additionally, real-time PCR analysis indicates that inhibition of NF-kappaB leads to a decrease in target genes implicated in glioma CSC biology, such as A20 and IL-6. We have also studied our glioma explants in both subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts to examine the role of NF-kappaB in vivo. We are utilizing microarrays to define the NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression signature in CD133+ cells. Our studies indicate a significant role for the NF-kappaB pathway in the biology of glioma CSCs, with possible parallels in CSCs of other tumor types.",Excluded
2508,"Pyruvate kinase and aspartate-glutamate carrier distributions reveal key metabolic links between neurons and glia in retina Symbiotic relationships between neurons and glia must adapt to structures, functions, and metabolic roles of the tissues they are in. We show here that Muller glia in retinas have specific enzyme deficiencies that can enhance their ability to synthesize Gln. The metabolic cost of these deficiencies is that they impair the Muller cell's ability to metabolize Glc. We show here that the cells can compensate for this deficiency by using metabolites produced by neurons. Muller glia are deficient for pyruvate kinase (PK) and for aspartate/glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1), a key component of the malate-aspartate shuttle. In contrast, photoreceptor neurons express AGC1 and the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase, which is commonly associated with aerobic glycolysis in tumors, proliferating cells, and some other cell types. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified type of metabolic relationship between neurons and glia. Muller glia compensate for their unique metabolic adaptations by using lactate and aspartate from neurons as surrogates for their missing PK and AGC1.",Excluded
3281,"Real versus simulated mobile phone exposures in experimental studies We examined whether exposures to mobile phone radiation in biological/clinical experiments should be performed with real-life Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) emitted by commercially available mobile phone handsets, instead of simulated EMFs emitted by generators or test phones. Real mobile phone emissions are constantly and unpredictably varying and thus are very different from simulated emissions which employ fixed parameters and no variability. This variability is an important parameter that makes real emissions more bioactive. Living organisms seem to have decreased defense against environmental stressors of high variability. While experimental studies employing simulated EMF-emissions present a strong inconsistency among their results with less than 50% of them reporting effects, studies employing real mobile phone exposures demonstrate an almost 100% consistency in showing adverse effects. This consistency is in agreement with studies showing association with brain tumors, symptoms of unwellness, and declines in animal populations. Average dosimetry in studies with real emissions can be reliable with increased number of field measurements, and variation in experimental outcomes due to exposure variability becomes less significant with increased number of experimental replications. We conclude that, in order for experimental findings to reflect reality, it is crucially important that exposures be performed by commercially available mobile phone handsets.

A single institution, prospective, randomized trial was performed in terminal cancer patients to compare tropisetron (TRO), metoclopramide (MET), and chlorpromazine (CHL) in the management of nausea and emesis. Patients had far advanced cancer, were far removed from chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and their nausea and emesis was not due to bowel obstruction, drug intake, or cranial, electrolytic, or metabolic causes. The effects of antiemetic treatments were evaluated from Days 1-15. METHODS. Two hundred and eighty patients were randomized to receive 1) MET+ dexamethasone (DEX) (10 mg*4 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 2) TRO (5 mg*l, orally), 3) TRO + MET (5 mg*l and 10 mg*2, respectively, orally), 4) TRO + MET + DEX (5 mg*l, 10 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 5) CHL + DEX (25 mg*2 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 6) TRO + CHL (5 mg*l and 12.5 mg*2, respectively, orally), or 7) TRO + CHL + DEX (5 mg*l, 12.5 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally). Total control was defined as no nausea or emesis. RESULTS. By the end of the 15th day, total control of emesis was obtained in 23.6% (9 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 78.9% (30 of 38) of TRO patients, 84.2% (32 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 92.3% (36 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 33.3 (13 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 84.6% (33 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 92.5% (37 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. Total control of nausea was achieved in 18.4% (7 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 65.7% (25 of 38) of TRO patients, 73.6% (28 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 87.1% (34 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 17.9% (7 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 74.3% (29 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 85% (34 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. When comparing MET + DEX versus TRO; MET + DEX versus TRO + MET; MET + DEX versus TRO + MET + DEX; MET + DEX versus TRO + CHL; MET + DEX versus TRO + CHL + DEX; CHL + DEX versus TRO; CHL + DEX versus TRO + MET; CHL + DEX versus TRO + MET + DEX; CHL + DEX versus TRO + CHL; and CHL + DEX versus TRO + CHL + DEX, significant differences were noted. All antiemetic drugs were well tolerated with no severe side effects observed in any treatment arm. C0NCLUSIONS.

3014,"Pre-and post-bevacizumab glioblastoma histopathology, biomarkers and imaging: An autopsy study Anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab is frequently used to treat recurrent glioblastomas (GBMs). Imaging after bevacizumab therapy to evaluate therapeutic response and/or progression is complicated by biologic alterations that may preclude detection of viable tumor by routine MRI methods. Preliminary data using an innovative and advanced diffusionweighted imaging technique developed at UC San Diego, restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), suggest that RSI provides a more robust marker of tumor cellularity relative to standard diffusion-weighted imaging. Previously published studies by others have demonstrated that bevacizumab- treated GBMs have altered imaging findings and relapse as tumors with a conspicuous perivascular invasive phenotype. This phenotype is also replicated by murine models of anti-angiogenic therapy. A biomarker study of four cases of paired pretreatment GBMs and post-bevacizumab autopsy brain tissue that was matched to RSI tumor zones was performed to better characterize the invasive tumor phenotype in response to bevacizumab. Patients were 56-66 years (mean: 61) at the time of diagnosis. Survival time from diagnosis to death ranged from 9 to 24 months (mean: 16). All patients received standard radiation and temozolamide, followed by bevacizumab. Histology of pre-treatment tumors was variable without a conspicuous perivascular invasive phenotype. RSI on post-bevacizumab therapy showed areas of high signal intensity consistent with tumor progression. Similar areas sampled at the time of autopsy revealed a conspicuous perivascular tumor phenotype.

3276,"The effectiveness and factors related to treatment results of gamma knife radiosurgery for meningiomas A retrospective analysis was conducted on 80 patients with intracranial mengiomas treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery between 1993 and 1996. The purpose was to analyze the efficacy of the treatment and to assess appropriate treatment parameters. The results were assessed by regular MR examinations, and tumor volume was measured at 6-month intervals. Mean follow-up duration was 21 months (range 6-45 months). 63 meningiomas were at the skull base and 17 were distal from the skull base. Tumor volumes <5 ml (n=38), 5-10 ml (n=21), 10-15 ml (n=14), 15-20 ml (n=7). The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the radiation dose. The groups were high- dose (peripheral dose 17-20 Gy, n=19), medium-dose (15-16 Gy, n=33) and low- dose (12-14 Gy, n=28) groups. A statistical method (Generalized Estimation Equation) was applied to compare treatment results in these groups with different doses and tumor volumes. The volume measurement at the latest follow-up showed 74% (59/80) meningiomas decreased in volume, 17% (14/80) had no tumor enlargement and 9% (7/80) had increased in volume. The increased volume was found more frequently in the patients with a short (6-12 months) follow-up period. In this series, the tumors had 32% reduction in average tumor volume at 3 years after radiosurgery. At the range of 12-20 Gy peripheral dose (PD), radiosurgery was effective to reduce tumor volume 0.7% per month (p<0.05). However, higher doses had no significant difference on tumor volume reduction (p > 0.05). On the other hand, high-dose (PD > 17 Gy) treatment was associated with a higher risk of temporary tumor swelling and the development of adverse radiation effects (AREs). The AREs detected on MR images occurred in (25/80) 31% patients. Only 6/25 AREs were symptomatic and 2 had neurological sequelae. Peripheral doses, tumor volumes and their locations had significant impacts on the ARE (p<0.05). In conclusion, a peripheral dose of 15-16 Gy may be adequate for meningiomas with small volumes (<=5 ml). In larger tumors (>=10 ml) a lower PD is preferred (12-14 Gy). To avoid initial tumor swelling and ARE, high-dose irradiation (PD > 17 Gy) is not recommended for meningiomas larger than 5 ml.",Excluded

Patients were stratified into five groups on the basis of dominating symptoms in different stages of disorders: group 1 included patients with the prevalence of asthenic symptoms (n=104); group 2 - with the prevalence of autonomous disorders (n=37); group 3 - with the marked neurotic-like symptom complex (n=10); group 4 - with depressive symptoms (n=10); group 5 - with disturbances of cognitive function. The control group included 150 healthy people. Recording and mapping of coherence (COH) of the brain electrical activity was conducted using the apparatus-software complex for topographic mapping of brain electrical activity NEURO-CM (Russia) with the bandwidth from 0 to 40 Hz and the time constant of 0.3 sec. The EEG record was carried out monopolar from symmetrical cortical zones (10-20% scheme). Changes of COH were characterized by staging in patients compared to the controls. In the initial stage of disease, the integrative links were decreased in the temporal cortical zones of the left hemisphere. The reduction of functional activity in temporal-central cortical zones was found that might be the consequence of mesodiencephalic dysfunction. In the later stages, temporal zones of the right hemisphere were mostly affected. The parallel reinforcement of functional activity of occipital zones, in particular, the increase of 'long links' with frontal areas, was noted in the overall formation of the psychoorganic syndrome. This phenomenon may be considered as a compensatory mechanism when the phylogenetically older cortical zones, which are more resistant to pathological changes, become leaders in the realization of integrative brain activity during the development of a pathological state.",Included

2615,"Prescription ISO-energy is a strong predictor of symptomatic adverse radiation effect in stereotactic radiosurgery of brain metastases Purpose/Objective(s): In this study, we aim to 1) determine whether a new parameter named prescription iso-energy (PIE) correlates with the development of symptomatic adverse radiation effect (ARE) after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain metastases and 2) compare PIE with known dosimetric prognostic parameters for ARE such as the 10 and 12-Gy isodose volume. Materials/Methods: The PIE is simply defined as the product of the prescription dose in Gy (joule/kg, equivalent to mJ/mL of tissue) and the prescription isodose volume in mL. The senior radiation oncologist of the study (PKS) had previously reviewed and scored outcome (no failure/ no ARE, failure, asymptomatic vs symptomatic ARE, and indeterminate cases of lesion enlargement) after SRS at our institution from 1998-2009 for 2,200 brain metastases with at least 3 months of imaging follow-up. For this analysis, we considered the 1,640 metastases treated with SRS alone, or SRS after previous whole-brain radiation therapy, for which there was no coalescence of 50% of prescription dose-volume with that of any nearby metastasis. A logistic regression model was then developed to correlate the incidence of symptomatic ARE with a series of parameters that included PIE and peripheral isodose volumes such as 8-Gy to 12-Gy isodose volume, scoring symptomatic ARE as 2, indeterminate cases as 1, and remaining outcomes as 0 (no failure and no ARE, failure, or asymptomatic ARE). Result(s): There were 50 cases of symptomatic ARE in this subset. Marginal levels of significance were achieved when correlating the incidence of symptomatic ARE with peripheral isodose volumes. For example, using 12-Gy isodose volume, the logistically regressed slope was 0.828 +/- 0.429 (P =.082) with a 95% confidence interval of -0.127-1.782, in which the zero slope value cannot be directly rejected from the model. In contrast, PIE (in the units of mJ or Gy-mL) was found to be highly significant in correlating with the incidence of symptomatic ARE, yielding a positive slope value of 1.264 +/- 0.275 (P =.0003) with a 95% confidence interval of 0.681-1.848. The adjusted R2 and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were also significantly improved for PIE versus 12-Gy isodose volume (R2 = 0.88 vs 0.77 and jBICj = 33 vs 21, respectively). Based on the PIE results, functional curves were derived that enable a user to evaluate risk of symptomatic ARE when prescribing a dose to various target volumes. Conclusion(s): Analysis of >1,500 brain metastases treated with SRS has demonstrated that PIE is strongly predicative of developing symptomatic ARE, correlating more strongly with risk of ARE than 10 or 12-Gy volume.",Excluded
3324,"Cross-talk between the O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and p53 in glioblastoma multiforme Background. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal malignant primary brain tumor in adults with a median survival time of approximately 14.6 months, despite treatment with surgery, concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein involved in resistance to TMZ in GBM. Our group showed that MGMT is a critical regulator of GBM angiogenesis, invasion and response to antiangiogenic treatment (sunitinib). While sunitinib treatment significantly decreased invasion in MGMT-positive cell lines, it led to a significant increase of invasion in MGMT-negative cell lines. Our group launched the first phase II clinical trial of concurrent sunitinib with RT and TMZ for selected patients with MGMT-positive tumors. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is involved in proliferation, angiogenesis and response to RT. Previous studies showed the effect of p53 in regulating MGMT levels. The role of MGMT and p53 in response to RT and sunitinib is unknown. We hypothesize that MGMT may affect levels of p53 and response to RT and sunitinib treatment. Results. We used isogenic human GBM cell lines isogenic for MGMT and assessed p53 levels by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. We showed for the first time that stable transfection of GBM cell line negative for MGMT (U87MG) and harboring wild type TP53 with a vector encoding for MGMT (U87MGMT) led to significant increase of p53 expression and its nuclear localization. Strikingly, increased p53 in U87MGMT cells did not lead to increased p21 protein, one of the main targets of p53. As shown by western blotting analysis, ionizing radiation (6 and 10 Gy) did not increase p21 levels compared to sham control. Interestingly, it was previously shown that irradiation does not lead to p21 activation in GBM cells with basal overexpression of p21 mRNA and can even lead to its repression as a mechanism of resistance to RT. We suggest that MGMT could be an upstream regulator of this resistance. Conclusion. Our study revealed a novel mechanism for regulation of p53 through MGMT, which may affect response to RT in GBM. We will further establish the relationship between MGMT/p53 status and response to combined RT and sunitinib in GBM cell lines and samples from patients enrolled in our clinical trial. This will lead to more efficient strategies of treatment for patients with tumors unresponsive to combined RT and sunitinib. Grant acknowledgments.

3277,"Neuroimaging and quality-of-life outcomes in patients with brain metastasis and peritumoral edema who undergo Gamma Knife surgery OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has been shown to be effective for treating many patients with brain metastasis. Some brain metastases demonstrate significant peritumoral edema; radiation may induce cerebral edema or worsening preexisting edema. This study was conducted to evaluate the imaging and neurobehavioral outcomes in patients with preexisting peritumoral edema who then undergo GKS.METHODS: Between August 2003 and January 2008, 63 cases of brain metastasis with significant peritumoral edema (> 20 cm(3)) were prospectively studied. The study inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a single metastatic lesion with significant edema (perilesional edema signal volume on FLAIR > 20 cm(3)); and 2) inclusion of only 1 lesion > 20 cm(3) in the study (in cases of multiple lesions noted on FLAIR images). All patients received MR imaging with pulse sequences including T1-weighted imaging and FLAIR with or without contrast and T2-weighted imaging at an interval of 3 months. A neurological assessment and Brain Cancer Module (BCM-20) questionnaire were obtained every 2-3 months. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used for analysis of survival and associated factors.RESULTS: At the time of GKS, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 70 (range 50-90), and the mean BCM-20 score was 45.5 +/- 6.1. The mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) was 5.2 +/- 4.6 cm(3) with corresponding T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volumes of 59.25 +/- 37.3 and 62.1 +/- 38.8 cm(3), respectively (R(2) = 0.977, p < 0.001). The mean edema index (volume of peritumoral edema/tumor volume) was 17.5 +/- 14.5. The mean peripheral and maximum GKS doses were 17.4 +/- 2.3 and 35 +/- 4.7 Gy, respectively. The median survival was 11 months. The longer survival was related to KPS scores >or= 70 (p = 0.008), age < 65 years (p = 0.022), and a reduction of > 6 in BCM-20 score (p = 0.007), but survival was not related to preexisting edema or tumor volume. A reduction in BCM-20 score of > 6 was related to decreased volume in T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging (p < 0.001). Thirty-eight (79.2%) of 48 patients demonstrated decreased tumor volume and accompanied by decreased T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volume. Eight (16.7%) of the 48 patients exhibited increased or stable tumor volume. A margin dose > 18 Gy was more likely to afford tumor reduction and resolution of peritumoral edema (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively). However, prior external-beam radiation therapy correlated with worsened preexisting peritumoral edema (p = 0.013) and longer maintenance of corticosteroids (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients demonstrating a reduction in the BCM-20 score > 6, age < 65 years, and KPS score >or= 70 exhibited longer survival. Significant preexisting edema did not influence the tumor response or clinical outcome. The resolution of edema was related to better quality of life but not to longer survival.",Excluded

The irradiated sites included the middle ear in one case and the ethmoid sinus in three cases, two of the latter possessed brain invasion. The chronological changes in MR images and the dose-volume histogram of the adjacent brain tissue were evaluated.RESULTS: CCF with or without multiple septi presented with a latency of 29-86 months (median, 45.5 months), which was preceded by either non-specific parenchymal enhancement or typical radiation necrosis. In three cases, CCF adjacent to the frontal base resultantly caused mass effect, and two of these three cases required surgical intervention at 38 and 54 months, respectively, after SRT for alleviation of symptoms. The relation of the irradiated brain volumes to the biological equivalent dose based on the linear-quadratic (LQ) and LQ-cubic models was represented as a threshold.CONCLUSION: When contemplating SRT for HNM cases, caution should be exercised to the dose-volume relation-ship of the adjacent brain tissue, especially the frontal base, as well as other critical structures, and long-term vigilant follow-up is also mandatory.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: CCF can occur as an unusual consequence of late brain injury with variable but mostly long latency following SRT for non-nasopharyngeal HNMs adjacent to the brain, even superficial parts that were previously irradiated via conventional radiotherapy.",Excluded

Background(s): Glioblastoma remains one of the most lethal human cancers, with median survival of just 12-15 months after surgical debulking, chemotherapy, and radiation. Numerous molecular targets are being explored for the development of novel therapeutics, but efficacy of these new compounds is limited given the lack of personalized utilization based on known genotypic information. Furthermore, the correlation between driver genetic mutations and various phenotypic characteristics that portend poor prognosis are unknown, thereby diminishing the use of potentially effective medications in the sickest patients. Recently, ontological databases have been developed to better detect genotype-phenotype-environment relationships, with the aim of identifying novel substrates or employing known genomic abnormalities for therapeutic development. Design/Methods: This study focuses on the development of a new multicenter glioblastoma ontology database, with the goal to identify key genotypic characteristics that associate with poor prognosis. Patients were enrolled in the study at each site, clinical information was entered retrospectively into a Redcap database, glioblastoma tissue samples were subjected to whole genome analysis, and a clinical ontology was created based on historical information provided. Result(s): The creation of this glioblastoma ontology serves as proof-of-principle for the potential for clinically meaningful hypothesis generation with such an instrument and as a template for other investigators, who can use relationships described in this ontology to analyze information in their own institutional repositories. The ontology described here will be published online and available for public viewing and broad application.

2513,"Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound for unilateral thalamotomy in medication refractory essential tremor Introduction: Essential Tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and is associated with significant functional impairment and disability. Ablative and stimulation-based surgical treatments have been developed to treat the significant number of patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical management. Although often providing effective tremor control, current surgical options have risks associated with intracranial procedures, as well as issues of durability and predictability of treatment response. Here, we explore the application of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) as an alternative, non-invasive means of generating thalamic lesions in patients with treatment-resistant ET. Method(s): Four patients underwent awake MRgFUS thalamotomy for refractory essential tremor (mean age 70.8; mean duration of illness 17.8 years). Diagnosis of refractory ET was confirmed by a movement disorder neurologist, and patients underwent baseline medical and imaging investigations prior to treatment. Tremor assessments and serial structural imaging were performed at 1, 7, 30 and 90 days following the procedure. Result(s): All four patients experienced immediate and sustained improvements in their dominant (treated) hand tremor (Figure 1). At 1- and 3-months following treatment, dominant hand tremor scores were reduced by a mean of 89% and 78%, respectively, on part A of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. Functional impairment decreased significantly at 3-months, with patients reporting improvements in writing, drinking and eating. There were no serious adverse events, with only one patient reporting persistent lip and finger paraesthesias at 3-months. Conclusion(s): MRgFUS appears to be a safe and effective means of non-invasively generating thalamic lesions for the relief of refractory ET. This technology is a promising alternative to radiation- and surgical-based approaches to lesional functional neurosurgery, but requires larger trials with more patients to verify its efficacy.

Hydrophone transducers were implanted in the models to record the microwave-induced mechanical vibrations. Four properly timed radar pulses produced a threefold increase in the acoustical amplitudes in the muscle model. In the spherical model, a pulse train of three properly timed microwave pulses doubled the stress wave amplitudes as recorded by the implanted hydrophone.

2567,"MiR-149-3p inhibits the glioma stem cellphenotype and re-sensitizes therapy-resistant GBM cells Intra-tumor heterogeneity presents one of the biggest challenges in the development of solid cancer therapeutics. Cells within the same tumor display distinct phenotypes that affect their growth rate, survival, migration, therapy-response, and tumor-propagating capacity. We now understand cancer stem cells (CSCs) play critical roles in driving intra-tumor cellular heterogeneity by establishing dynamic cellular transitions within tumors. GBM are highly aggressive tumors that display a poorly differentiated cell phenotype characterized by high expression of genes enriched in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Lineage-tracing experiments show that stem-like cells are responsible for GBM re-growth after therapy and this process is in part mediated by known drivers of stemness (e.g. Sox2). There is a strong correlation between the expression of stem cell drivers and markers and tumor recurrence in multiple cancers, including GBM. We and others have established that reprogramming transcription factors Oct4 and Sox2 are important drivers of the stem-cell, tumor and therapy-resistant phenotype in GBM. We present data showing that GBM cells expressing transgenic Oct4 and Sox2 are more resistant to ionizing radiation (IR) treatment and exposing GBM neurospheres to temozolomide (TMZ) and IR gives rise to a cell sub-set with higher gene expression levels of Oct4 and Sox2 compared to untreated cells. The clinical and potential therapeutic relevance of this phenotype is supported by multi-dimensional transcriptome analyses that identifies a group of genes induced by Oct4 and Sox2 enriched in recurrent GBM. The promiscuous quality of miRNAs is an underexploited characteristic that could allow the targeting of multiple parallel oncogenic pathways using a single agent, enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing chances of tumor recurrence. To explore this untapped potential, we predicted miRNAs likely to target the transcripts induced by Oct4/Sox2 in recurrent GBM and identified miR-149-3p as a high-priority candidate. Importantly, transient expression of miR-149-3p simultaneously repressed these transcripts in GSCs as measured by qRT-PCR, concurrent with a decrease in the capacity of both parental and GSCs expressing transgenic Oct4/Sox2 to self-renew as spheres, a biomarker of cell stemness and tumor-propagating potential. Additionally, transient expression of miR-149-3p also re-sensitized therapy-resistant GBM neurospheres to TMZ treatment. These results show this resistant phenotype is reversible and support our hypothesis that GSC-driving mechanisms induce a subset of genes that give rise to therapy-resistant GBM cells and suggests that miR-149-3p can be developed as a therapeutic for recurrent GBM.",Excluded

We assessed the incidence of such localization. Material(s) and Method(s): A blinded central retrospective review of initial imaging and charts of 28 patients with intracranial germinomas was performed. 13 were pineal, 12 supraoptic (7 bifocal), 1 optic nerve, 1 corpus callosum and 1 brainstem. Result(s): Among 11 patients that complained of decreased visual acuity (DVA), 6 did not have signs of intracranial pressure: 5 of them had an invasion of OP. Two had normal fundi, 3 abnormal fundi. Three had a supraoptic mass with contiguous involvement of the chiasma. Another patient had DVA and endocrinological symptoms. The MRI showed pineal tumor. Biopsy revealed a germinoma. CSF bHCG were raised (90UI/L). This ""bifocal"" ""secreting' tumor was treated with chemotherapy and focal radiation on both primaries. He relapsed with a diffuse ventricular and meningeal dissemination. The review showed that the thickening of optic nerves with contrast enhancement was overlooked, and optic nerve wasn't included in the radiation field. The last patient had DVA. The MRI showed a chiasmatic and optic nerve tumor. Among the 8 other patients with supraoptic germinoma and the 15 patients with others locations, 6 had DVA. Patients with abnormal fundi and/or DVA all had intracranial hypertension. MRI showed no involvement of OP.

Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",Included

2961,"Doses greater than 85 Gy and two isocenters in Gamma Knife surgery for trigeminal neuralgia: updated results OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in treating patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Preliminary results of this study were previously reported. The updated results are reported in this paper.METHODS: Ninety seven patients with TN refractory to medical or surgical management underwent GKS between September 1998 and October 2005. Fifteen patients had multiple sclerosis (MS). The radiation dose was escalated from 70 to 99 Gy. The Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Scale (BNIPS) was used to assess pain before and after GKS. Eighty-four patients were available for evaluation with a mean follow up of 8.9 months. The overall response and complete response rates were 70.2% and 36.9%, respectively. At 12 months, there was a greater improvement in BNIPS scores for patients who were treated with two isocenters compared with those treated with a single isocenter. The mean percentage of pain decrease was 56.26% compared with 11.53% (p < 0.001). Patients treated with two isocenters rather than one and patients receiving greater than 85 Gy compared with lower doses had a longer duration of response. Only nine patients (11%) had mild numbness attributable to the GKS. Five of the nine patients experienced complete resolution of facial numbness on follow up. Patients with MS have a shorter duration of response compared with those without MS (p = 0.35).CONCLUSIONS: These updated results show that GKS continues to be an effective therapy for TN. It appears there is an enhanced response with doses 85 Gy or more and with two isocenters without increased complications.",Excluded
2829,"Non-invasive follow-up of patients with intracranial arteriovenous malformations after proton-beam radiation therapy In order better to follow non-invasively the effect of proton beam therapy upon intracranial arteriovenous malformations, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) was used in 10 patients, in addition to conventional follow-up with angiography and computed tomography (CT); in six patients, pre- and postradiation TCD studies were obtained. The mean flow values obtained from the major arteries in the circle of Willis indicate an early flow reduction through the AVM of approximately 15% with further reduction between 2/3 and 1/2 of the initial values within 15 months of follow-up. CT showed a reduction of contrast enhancement in those patients in whom scans could be compared.

The original transfection frequency, as measured by transformed foci, was markedly reduced in two A-T strains when compared with either normal or xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts. As with SV40 virion-transformed fibroblasts, pSV ori--transformed cells entered a crisis phase, from which about one-fourth of the original clones from A-T and normal fibroblasts recovered. Both the pSV ori--transformed TAT2SF cell line and an SV40 virion-transformed AT5BI (GM5489) cell line retained their characteristic sensitivity to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation, as well as their X ray-resistant DNA synthesis. Southern blot analysis of cellular SV40 sequences demonstrated a single major integration site of pSV ori- in the AT2SF cells. In contrast, AT5BI cells transformed with SV40 virions demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity of integrated viral sequences. Neither the TAT2SF nor the GM5489 transformed cell line contains any detectable freely replicating SV40 viral sequences, which are seen in many other semipermissive SV40-transformed cells.",Excluded
3007,"Sparing of cochleae and eyes in whole brain radiation therapy with boost by helical tomotherapy and noncoplanar VMAT Purpose/Objective: Simple low conformity lateral opposing radiation beams with limited sparing to proximal organs-atrisk (OARs) were widely adopted in the past for treating palliative whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Crucial OARs located at skull base used to sacrifice with significant radiation dose inevitably. More conformal radiation treatments, like helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), are becoming more accepted to treat WBRT. These techniques allow not only conformal dose to the whole brain but also simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) doses to dedicated metastases for superior disease control and symptom relief. This study aimed to investigate any potential advantages in cochleae and eyes sparing between HT and non-coplanar VMAT. Material(s) and Method(s): Treatment planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 15 brain metastasis patients who had received palliative dose WBRTs with SIBs to the metastases in the department were recruited. Each patient was re-planned with HT and non-coplanar VMAT for dosimetric comparison. Departmental routine optimal settings with fan beam thickness of 2.5cm and pitch value of 0.287 were used in all HT plans. One coplanar full arc plus two non-coplanar half arcs modulating by Varian Millennium 120 MLCs were used in all VMAT plans. The two non-coplanar half arcs were arranged at 60 degrees offset to each other and to the coplanar full arc to cover the cranial hemisphere. All target volumes were optimized according to original prescriptions. The median whole brain dose was 30Gy (range 25-40Gy) and the median SIB dose was 35Gy (range 30-45Gy). The mean SIB volume was 26.7+/-30.4cc consisting 1.7+/-1.8% of the whole brain volume 1481.8+/-161.1cc. Radiation doses to cochleae and eyes were studied by comparing their maximum doses (Dmax) and mean doses (Dmean). The dose results from the two techniques were tested statistically by paired t-test considering significant level of p-value <0.05. Result(s): The dose results are listed in Table 1. Non-coplanar VMAT significantly achieved lower Dmax and Dmean to both cochleae than HT (all p<0.001). Radiation doses to both eyes were slightly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT but could not be shown statistically significant (all p>0.05). However, the Dmax and Dmean to both lens were significantly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion(s): Non-coplanar VMAT is superior to HT in sparing cochleae which are relatively small and highly proximal to target volumes. There is no significant dose difference in eyes sparing for both techniques. Non-coplanar VMAT is preferred to treat WBRT with SIB if slight increase in lens doses is not a concern.

Prior studies have suggested that donepezil, a neurotransmitter modulator, may improve cognitive function.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 198 adult brain tumor survivors >= 6 months after partial- or whole-brain irradiation were randomly assigned to receive a single daily dose (5 mg for 6 weeks, 10 mg for 18 weeks) of donepezil or placebo. A cognitive test battery assessing memory, attention, language, visuomotor, verbal fluency, and executive functions was administered before random assignment and at 12 and 24 weeks. A cognitive composite score (primary outcome) and individual cognitive domains were evaluated.RESULTS: Of this mostly middle-age, married, non-Hispanic white sample, 66% had primary brain tumors, 27% had brain metastases, and 8% underwent prophylactic cranial irradiation. After 24 weeks of treatment, the composite scores did not differ significantly between groups (P = .48); however, significant differences favoring donepezil were observed for memory (recognition, P = .027; discrimination, P = .007) and motor speed and dexterity (P = .016). Significant interactions between pretreatment cognitive function and treatment were found for cognitive composite (P = .01), immediate recall (P = .05), delayed recall (P = .004), attention (P = .01), visuomotor skills (P = .02), and motor speed and dexterity (P < .001), with the benefits of donepezil greater for those who were more cognitively impaired before study treatment.CONCLUSION: Treatment with donepezil did not significantly improve the overall composite score, but it did result in modest improvements in several cognitive functions, especially among patients with greater pretreatment impairments.",Excluded
2682,"Influence of extremely low frequency magnetic fields on Ca2+ signaling and NMDA receptor functions in rat hippocampus Extremely low frequency (ELF<300Hz) electromagnetic fields affect several neuronal activities including memory. Because ELF magnetic fields cause altered Ca(2+) homeostasis in neural tissues, we examined their influence on Ca(2+) signaling enzymes in hippocampus and related them with NMDA receptor functions. Hippocampal regions were obtained from brains of 21-day-old rats that were exposed for 90 days to 50Hz magnetic fields at 50 and 100 microT intensities. In comparison to controls, ELF exposure caused increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels concomitant with increased activities of Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase C (PKC), cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calcineurin as well as decreased activity of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in hippocampal regions. Simultaneous ligand-binding studies revealed decreased binding to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. The combined results suggest that perturbed neuronal functions caused by ELF exposure may involve altered Ca(2+) signaling events contributing to aberrant NMDA receptor activities.",Excluded

2727,"Retrospective outcomes of right colon continent urinary diversion in a single center, improving the characterization of complication and reoperation risk INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Published studies of right colon pouch urinary diversion have variable outcomes with an estimated 1-50% risk of perioperative Clavien-Dindo 3+ complications and 1-69% risk of long term reoperation. This range is partly due to variability in outcome measurement and inclusion of differing patient characteristics and operative indications; it is unclear which factors are predisposing factors for complications and risk of reoperation in these studies leaving preoperative counseling difficult. We seek to characterize the impact that patient specific factors and operative indications have on risk of complications and reoperation for patients undergoing a right colon pouch as well as present the cumulative risk of reoperation over time. METHOD(S): Patients undergoing right colon pouch from January 2010 to April 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Outcomes of interest were rate of Clavien-Dindo complications in the perioperative period, readmission rate, and rate of reoperation. Patient specific factors association with Clavien Grade 3+ complications and reoperation were also analyzed. Operative indication for patients was stratified into: Cancer, Radiation Injury, Neurogenic, and Non-Neurogenic. A Kaplan Meier plot was used to characterize reoperation risk over time with death as a competing factor. RESULT(S): During the study period 60 patients underwent the procedure with an average follow up of 22 months. The rate of Clavien Grade 3+ complications and readmission rate in the 90 day post operative period was 25% and 43% respectively. The cumulative rate of reoperation was 52%. Overall no patient factors or operative indications were significantly associated with complications or reoperation. CONCLUSION(S): Overall the rate of complications, readmissions, and reoperation was high, but in agreement with other contemporary series. Right colon pouch is a difficult procedure on which to counsel patients due to the paucity of available data. The surgical outcomes and results at our center help further characterize the risks associated with this procedure, and the Kaplan Meier plot of reoperation risk can be used to illustrate that this procedure comes with significant risks over time.",Excluded

2571,"Performance and brain electrical activity during prolonged confinement A subset of the AGARD-STRES battery including memory search, unstable tracking, and a combination of both tasks (dual-task), was applied repeatedly to the four chamber crew members before, during, and after the 60-day isolation period of EXEMSI. Five ground control group members served as a control group. A subjective state questionnaire was also included. The results were subjected to a quantitative single-subject analysis. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded to permit correlation of changes in task performance with changes in the physiological state. Evaluation of the EEG focused on spectral parameters of spontaneous EEG waves. No physiological data were collected from the control group. Significant decrements in tracking ability were observed in the chamber crew. The time course of these effects followed a triphasic pattern with initial deterioration, intermediate recovery to pre-isolation baseline scores after the first half of the isolation period, and a second deterioration towards the end. None of the control group subjects displayed such an effect. Memory search (speed and accuracy) was only occasionally impaired during isolation, but the control group displayed a similar pattern of changes. It is suggested that a state of decreased alertness causes tracking deterioration, which leads to a reduced efficiency of sustained cue utilization. The assumption of low alertness was further substantiated by higher fatigue ratings by the chamber crew compared to those of the control group. Analysis of the continuous EEG recordings revealed that only two subjects produced reliable alpha wave activity (8-12 Hz) over Pz and, to a much smaller extent, Fz-theta wave activity (5-7 Hz) during task performance. In both subjects Pz-alpha power decreased consistently under task conditions involving single-task and dual-task tracking. Fz-theta activity was increased more by single-task and dual-task memory search than by single-task tracking. The alpha attenuation appears to be associated with an increasing demand on perceptual cue utilization required by the tracking performance. In one subject marked attenuation of alpha power occurred during the first half of the confinement period, where he also scored the highest fatigue ratings. A striking increase in fronto-central theta activity was observed in the same subject after six weeks of isolation. The change was associated with an efficient rather than a degraded task performance, and a high rating of the item ""concentrated"" and a low rating of the item ""fatigued."" This finding supports the hypothesis that the activation state associated with increased fronto-central theta activity accompanies efficient performance of demanding mental tasks. The usefulness of standardized laboratory tasks as monitoring instruments is demonstrated by the direct comparability with results of studies obtained from other relevant research applications using the same tasks. The feasibility of a self-administered integrated psychophysiological assessment of the individual state was illustrated by the nearly complete collection of data. The large number of individual data collected over the entire period permitted application of quantitative single-subject analysis, allowing reliable determination of changes in the individual state in the course of time. It thus appears that this assessment technique can be adapted for in-flight monitoring of astronauts during prolonged spaceflights. Parallel EEG recording can provide relevant supplementary information for diagnosing the individual activation state associated with task performance. The existence of large individual differences in the generation of task-sensitive EEG rhythms forms an important issue for further studies.",Excluded
2835,"Action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the isolated photosensory pineal organ The effect of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), its agonists (muscimol, baclofen) and antagonist (bicuculline) on pineal ganglion cells of the luminosity type were studied in the isolated, superfused pineal organ of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Extracellular recordings revealed that GABA added through the superfusion medium caused a clear alteration of the activity of projecting neurons, which transmit luminosity responses to the brain. Spontaneous discharges of ganglion cells were predominantly suppressed by GABA (33 neurons out of 48), but 10 neurons were clearly excited. Similar effects were observed after addition of muscimol, but not of baclofen. Bicuculline reversed the GABA and muscimol induced inhibition or excitation. In 4 neurons of the luminosity type, GABA caused bidirectional, inhibitory and excitatory responses depending on the state of light- or dark-adaptation. These observations suggest a role of a GABAergic mechanism in the generation and transmission of luminosity responses in the trout pineal organ. It appears that GABA participates in the modulation of light sensitivity during light- and dark-adaptation processes and that this action is mediated by GABAA receptors.",Excluded

While the mission is of utmost importance, preservation of astronaut's well-being is paramount also. To that end, mitigation of radiation risk especially afflicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of great interest and challenge. Current data from astronauts on low earth orbit and Apollo missions provides insight on the risk of CVD from radiation exposure. However, data is limited given the small cohort size of astronauts who embarked on just nine prolonged missions. Therefore, a cerebral approach to understanding and mitigating risks are essential. This paper discusses the need for a predictive preclinical model to help understand and mitigate the effects of radiation on astronauts. We will discuss strengths and limitations of preclinical models and the methods of validating and constructing a model to predict human clinical outcomes. Our bedside-bench-bedside approach focuses on adapting the preclinical model through common investigative tools used between humans and animals. The result will be an optimization of preclinical model to a point of being a surrogate clinical model capable of predicting CVD outcomes in astronauts exposed to radiation.

Both diffusion tensor metrics and volumetric measures were analyzed in the brain regions involved in the visual function.RESULTS: The fractional anisotropy was reduced in the right posterior thalamic radiations (P = .0009) and remained significant after a false discovery rate (FDR) correction (P = .03). A trend of increase in the mean diffusivities of different subregions of the occipital cortex on the right side, including calcarine, middle occipital, inferior occipital, and fusiform gyri, was noted and became insignificant after FDR correction. Similarly, there was a trend of cortical thinning involving the right occipital lobe and bilateral fusiform gyri, volume reduction of the left thalamus, and increase in lateral ventricular volume in the postflight scans.CONCLUSION: Gray and white matter alterations are detected by quantitative MRI before and after space flight.

3251,"Alteration of Interneuron Immunoreactivity and Autophagic Activity in Rat Hippocampus after Single High-Dose Whole-Brain Irradiation The effects of high dose gamma radiation on brain tissue are poorly understood, with both limited and major changes reported. The present study compared the effects of gamma irradiation on the expression of interneuron markers within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region with expression in control matched rats. This area was chosen for study because of its well-characterized circuitry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 60 Gy of whole brain gamma radiation and after 24 or 48 hours, the brains were removed, fixed and sectioned to quantitate expression of parvalbumin (PV), calbindin-D28K (CB), reelin, neuropeptide-Y (NPY), and somatostatin. All of these markers increased in expression over the first 48 hours, except NPY, which decreased. This provides novel information on changes in gene expression in the hippocampal interneurons following radiation. Staining for Beclin 1, a marker of autophagy, increased most strongly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased intracellular calcium follows irradiation, leading to an increased expression of calcium binding proteins. Increased autophagy occurs in the neurogenic zone of the dentate hilus, consistent with reduced effective neurogenesis after irradiation.",Included

Changes developing in the gait of the group of pigs receiving a mean maximum dose of 24.3 Gy after 10-15 weeks led to the irradiation of two additional animals. They received mean maximum dose of 24.9 +/- 0.2 Gy (n=2), targeted to the left spinal nerves of C5-C8. The followup period was one year. Histologic sections from spinal cords and available spinal nerves were evaluated. MR imaging was performed on pigs in the 24.9 Gy group.RESULTS: No pig that received a maximum spinal nerve point dose <=19.0 Gy experienced a change in gait while all pigs that received >=24.1 Gy experienced paralysis. Extensive degeneration and fibrosis were observed in irradiated spinal nerves of the 24.9 Gy animals. All spinal cord sections were normal.

In this study, we developed nanoparticle formulations to facilitate the use of IR780 for fluorescent imaging of malignant brain tumor.METHODS: Self-assembled IR780-liposomes and IR780-phospholipid micelles were prepared and their NIRF properties were characterized. The intracellular accumulation of IR780-nanoparticles in glioma cells were determined using confocal microscopy.

This research was aimed to evaluate the safety and accuracy of the techniques of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion by using a computer-assisted spinal navigation system combined with electromyography monitoring.METHODS: Sixteen patients underwent minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. A computer-assisted spinal navigation system and electromyography were used for guiding pedicle screw placement. The operative duration, blood loss, complications, and fluoroscopic time were recorded. Clinical outcome was assessed by Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index. Radiographic images were obtained to evaluate the accuracy of pedicle screw placement and fusion rates.RESULTS: The Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores were vastly improved postoperatively. A total of 64 pedicle screws were implanted and three were regarded as misplacement by post-operative CT scan. Three screw trajectories were adjusted according to intra-operative stimulus-evoked electromyography monitoring. The average fluoroscopy time in each patient was 31.8 seconds, which equals to 7.9 seconds per pedicle screw. No patients had instrument related neurological complications, infection, implant failure or revision. Successful fusion was found in all patients.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of navigation system and real-time electromyography monitoring can make the minimally invasive operation more safe and accurate while decreasing radiation exposure time of the medical staff and patient and minimizing the chance and the degree of the pedicle screw misplacement.",Excluded

The production of in vivo bremsstrachlung radiation hazards warrants evaluation. The bremsstrahlung component of the decay scheme of 165Dy has been traditionally ignored in internal dosimetry calculations. We have estimated the bremsstrahlung dose of 165Dy distributed in muscle and bone to body by various internal organs (adrenals, brain, breasts, gallbladder wall, LLI wall, small intestine, stomach, ULI wall, heart wall, kidneys, liver, lungs, muscle, ovaries, pancreas, red marrow, bone surfaces, skin, spleen, testes, thymus, thyroid, urine bladder wall, uterus, fetus, placenta, and total body) during radiosynovictomy. In the present study, muscle and bone are considered to be source organs. These estimated values show that the bremsstrahlung radiation absorbed dose contribution from an organ to itself is very small compared to that originating from the beta source. However, contribution to other organs is not always negligible, especially when large amounts of 165Dy may be involved, such as in therapy applications. Hence the component of the total dose due to bremsstrahlung dose should be considered in radiosynovictomy or other therapy applications.",Excluded
2544,"Monitoring the upper tracts in neurogenic bladder dysfunction Altered bladder physiology as a result of neuromuscular disease may exert a profound influence on upper urinary tract function. Upper urinary tract abnormalities may occur in these patients in the absence of symptomatology and a systematic program of long-term surveillance is required. Monitoring the upper urinary tract to detect abnormalities that would require an alteration in bladder management is likely one of the key factors that has resulted in the decreased morbidity and mortality in neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Excretory urography, comprehensive renal scintillation procedures, and renal ultrasound examinations all have played a role in monitoring upper urinary tract dysfunction. Cystourethrography has been utilized to detect vesicoureteral reflux. Comprehensive renal scintillation procedures have some distinct advantages over excretory urography, including lack of adverse reactions, lack of need for bowel preparation and dehydration, and lower radiation exposure. These factors have improved patient compliance in returning for follow-up examinations. The sensitivity of the comprehensive renal scintillation procedure has allowed it to replace the excretory urogram, the cystourethrogram, and serum creatinine as monitors of upper urinary tract function at our institution.

2433,"Sonic Hedgehog signaling impairs ionizing radiation-induced checkpoint activation and induces genomic instability The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway plays important roles in embryogenesis, stem cell maintenance, tissue repair, and tumorigenesis. Haploinsufficiency of Patched-1, a gene that encodes a repressor of the Shh pathway, dysregulates the Shh pathway and increases genomic instability and the development of spontaneous and ionizing radiation (IR)-induced tumors by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that Ptc1(+/-) mice have a defect in the IR-induced activation of the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint signaling pathway. Likewise, transient expression of Gli1, a downstream target of Shh signaling, disrupts Chk1 activation in human cells by preventing the interaction of Chk1 with Claspin, a Chk1 adaptor protein that is required for Chk1 activation. These results suggest that inappropriate Shh pathway activation promotes tumorigenesis by disabling a key signaling pathway that helps maintain genomic stability and inhibits tumorigenesis.",Excluded
3461,"A new technique of ""double-A"" bilateral flaps based on perforators for the treatment of sacral defects BACKGROUND: Myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps can provide stable coverage of sacral defects. For neurologically intact patients, sensate innervated gluteal artery perforator flaps are the ideal solution. For patients with spinal cord injury, soft-tissue coverage can be performed with a variety of noninnervated flaps. METHOD(S): Between 1997 and 2004, the authors operated on 30 patients, 21 men and nine women, using bilateral gluteal distal fasciocutaneous and proximal musculocutaneous vertical vector rotation-advancement flaps, based on perforators with V-Y closures. The ages of the patients ranged from 32 to 74 years. Twenty-five patients had spinal cord injuries and all had sacral pressure sores extending to the bone. Three patients had low-grade malignant tumors (sacral chordomas); one had a sacral radiation-induced necrosis and two senile patients with large sacral defects had chronic renal failure and multiple sclerosis. No comorbidities were found in the sample. RESULT(S): All the lesions were closed successfully. After follow-up of 1 to 8 years, 27 patients never required repeated surgery after wound complications. Three patients had infection and partial dehiscence of the flaps that healed after reoperation with V-Y readvancement; three died as a result of their primary diseases. CONCLUSION(S): This flap design has been used only in selected cases because, after its elevation, use of other gluteal-based flaps for future sacral reconstructions may not be possible. Five neurologically intact patients were found to have good sensitive protection of the flaps and adequate cushion contour after surgery because the authors conserved the gluteal arteries, perforators, and their corresponding sensory nerves. ©2007American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",Excluded

It may be produced by a desk-top method developed previously for 186Re(Sn)HEDP using 188Re produced through neutron irradiation of either enriched 187Re or naturally occurring rhenium targets or the use of a 188W/188Re generator.RESULTS: So long as the mass of rhenium in the 188Re-perrhenate to be processed into 188Re(Sn)HEDP is at least 100 microg, satisfactory radiochemical yields and purity may be obtained by all methods. The 188Re(Sn)HEDP has biodistribution and radiation dosimetry characteristics that are similar to those noted previously for 186Re(Sn)HEDP and appears to result in similar benefits and toxicities in patients with skeletal metastases. External radiation exposure monitoring indicates that, only 4 hr after a therapeutic administration of 1110 MBq (30 mCi) of 188Re(Sn)HEDP, average exposure rates at 1 meter from the patient would be only 0.5 mR/hr.CONCLUSION: Same-day, on-demand, outpatient therapy of disseminated skeletal metastases appears to be feasible with 188Re(Sn)HEDP.",Excluded
2807,"Altered cellular morphology and microfilament array in ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblasts Cells derived from individuals with the ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome demonstrate a number of unusual properties. They are highly sensitive to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation and also fail to demonstrate the normal inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with this type of DNA-damaging agent. Additionally, a number of ataxia-telangiectasia lymphoblastoid lines have been shown to have an unusual regulation of the cellular actin levels. However, the primary lesion causing ataxia-telangiectasia is unknown. In this paper we report an altered cellular morphology in three ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblast lines, but not in a number of control fibroblast lines. Investigation of the cytoskeleton using antibodies against certain cytoskeletal proteins revealed a difference in the microfilament pattern from ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblasts compared to controls. Ataxia fibroblasts showed a microfilament stress fiber pattern that appeared to have a more well defined and abundant array of stress fibers than control fibroblasts. In contrast, no differences were observed in the microtubule array, nor in the vinculin patterns between any of the cell lines. In addition to the differences in the microfilament patterns, ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblasts differed in their ability to recover from microfilament disruption by dimethyl sulfoxide. Control fibroblasts returned to a normal cellular state in a shorter time compared to ataxia fibroblasts, as judged by indirect immunofluorescence using antiactin. These results provide further evidence for a cytoskeletal anomaly in ataxia-telangiectasia.",Excluded
3357,"YKL-40 expression is associated with poorer response to radiation and shorter overall survival in glioblastoma PURPOSE: YKL-40 is a secreted protein that has been reported to be overexpressed in epithelial cancers and gliomas, although its function is unknown. Previous data in a smaller sample set suggested that YKL-40 was a marker associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a genetically defined subgroup of glioblastoma. Here we test these findings in a larger series of patients with glioblastoma, and in particular, determine if tumor YKL-40 expression is associated with radiation response.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=147) with subtotal resections were studied for imaging-assessed changes in tumor size in serial studies following radiation therapy. An additional set (n=140) of glioblastoma patients who underwent a gross-total resection was tested to validate the survival association and extend them to patients with minimal residual disease.RESULTS: In the subtotal resection group, higher YKL-40 expression was significantly associated with poorer radiation response, shorter time to progression and shorter overall survival. The association of higher YKL-40 expression with poorer survival was validated in the gross-total resection group. In multivariate analysis with both groups combined (n = 287), YKL-40 was an independent predictor of survival after adjusting for patient age, performance status, and extent of resection. YKL-40 expression was also compared with genetically defined subsets of glioblastoma by assessing epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and loss at chromosome 10q, two of the common recurring aberrations in these tumors, using fluorescent in situ hybridization. YKL-40 was significantly associated with 10q loss.CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate YKL-40 as an important marker of therapeutic response and genetic subtype in glioblastomas and suggest that it may play an oncogenic role in these tumors.",Included

The width of the Gauss function was varied in 640 steps. Some parts of the transformation were extended, analysed and averaged in the frequency domain to explore oscillatory components of the impulse pattern.

[French] Twenty eight patients with large defects of the dome of the skull underwent reconstruction by means of a cranial homograft sterilised by gamma radiation. These cases were followed clinically, radiologially and by isotope examinations, with a follow-up of 2 to 6 years (from 1979 to 1983). This procedure appears to be useful in major reconstructions of the dome of the skull when autografts cannot be used. A good aesthetic result is obtained by means of a single piece of bone prepared according to the site and dimensions of the skull defect. Because homografts are able to induce renewed osteogenesis, it seems preferable to use these grafts rather than non-biological materials.",Excluded

We have limited information on radiotherapy-induced symptoms 10-17 years after therapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 1997, women with lymph node-negative breast cancer were randomised in a Swedish multi-institutional trial to breast conserving surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. In 2007, 10-17 years after randomisation, the group included 422 recurrence-free women. We collected data with a study-specific questionnaire on eight pre-selected symptom groups.RESULTS: For six symptom groups (oedema in breast or arm, erysipelas, heart symptoms, lung symptoms, rib fractures, and decreased shoulder mobility) we found similar occurrence in both groups. Excess occurrence after radiotherapy was observed for pain in the breast or in the skin, reported to occur ""occasionally"" by 38.1% of survivors having undergone radiotherapy and surgery versus 24.0% of those with surgery alone (absolute difference 14.1%; p=0.004) and at least once a week by 10.3% of the radiotherapy group versus 1.7% (absolute difference 8.6%; p=0.001). Daily life and analgesic use did not differ between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Ten to 17 years after postoperative radiotherapy 1 in 12 women had weekly pain that could be attributed to radiotherapy. The symptoms did not significantly affect daily life and thus the reduced risk for local recurrence seems to outweigh the risk for long-term symptoms for most women.",Included
2434,"Investigation of higher-order cognitive functions during exposure to a high static magnetic field PURPOSE: To test for potential changes in higher-order cognitive processes related to the exposure to a high static magnetic field.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers participated in two experimental sessions inside a 3 Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnet. During one session the magnetic field was ramped down. The tasks consisted of six well-established paradigms probing a variety of cognitive functions. Reaction times (RT) and accuracies (AC) were recorded for statistical analysis.RESULTS: The overall performance was very similar in both sessions. Strong task-specific effects (all P < 0.006) were consistent with previously published results. Direct comparisons of task-specific effects between the two sessions (magnetic field on or off) remained insignificance for all paradigms (RT: all P > 0.196; AC: all P > 0.17; no corrections for multiple comparisons).CONCLUSION: The results did not indicate any apparent safety concerns with respect to cognitive performance in a static magnetic field of a typical whole-body magnet. In addition, comparisons of cognitive effects from testing situations with and without exposure to high static magnetic fields can be considered valid.",Excluded
3314,"Survival and danger signals expression in glioblastoma cell lines: Tumour immunogenicity after radiation and chemotherapy Tumour immunogenicity is the ability of a tumour to induce an immune response that can prevent its growth. The tumour cell microenvironment, the stroma and immunity have a major role in cancer. When cells die as a result of chemoradiotherapy, the innate immune system not only alerts the adaptive immune system to potential danger, but also induces an inflammatory response. Defined proteins that appear at the surface of stressed and dying cells and are released from the cells can stimulate this immune response. The molecular mechanism accounting for the expression of immunogenic signals, in particular, in glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumour, is presently under investigation. In this tumour it is necessary not only to develop a strategy to kill cancer cells efficiently, but also to attempt to stimulate an immune response to keep residual tumour under control. In our studies we investigated cell death and survival after single treatments or combination of X rays and temozolomide in glioblastoma cell lines (T98G, U87 and U251MG) and we attempted to identify danger signals, HMGB1 and HSP70, that are released by dying cells and could activate anti-tumour immunity that might contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of treatments. Our results confirmed recent data showing a resistance to ionizing radiation of these cell lines. Under our experimental conditions, after a dose of 2 Gy and 10 Gy we observed a drastic increase of cell death. Our data suggested that HSP70 and HMGB1 were expressed and released in response to single or combined treatments of radiation and temozolomide, confirming a role of these proteins as signals released after radiation-induced damage in glioblastoma cells. We also could state that temozolomide had limited effectiveness in activating HMGB1 and HSP70 signalling and, instead, an adjuvant effect in their expression and release was observed in some combined treatments, but this depended on schedule, cell line and timing.",Excluded

2776,"Incidental retinal phototoxicity associated with ingestion of photosensitizing drugs BACKGROUND: to report on the possible correlation between incident retinal phototoxicity and the use of photosensitizing drugs.METHODS: four patients were examined because of scotomas and visual loss after an incidental exposure to a strong light source. One patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash; one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens implantation. The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.RESULTS: on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure. Despite the visual recovery, non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected eyes.CONCLUSION: phototoxicity following incidental light exposure may occur in patients taking drugs of photosensitizing potential. Therefore, the thorough history of systemic drug ingestion should be obtained if patients have exposure to strong light sources.",Excluded
3320,"Comparison of Whole Heart Computed Tomography Scanners for Image Quality Lower Radiation Dosing in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography: The CONVERGE Registry RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Novel technology in coronary computed tomographic angiography allows assessment of coronary artery disease with high image quality (IQ). There are currently two wide detector ""whole heart"" coverage scanners available, which avoid misregistration artifacts. However, there are no data directly comparing IQ between the two scanners. The aim of the current study is to investigate if IQ is different between the most scanners of GE and Toshiba broad detector scanners.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter international cohort study comparing 236 consecutive patients who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography using whole-heart scanners; 126 patients on scanner S1 ( Aquilion ONE Vision, Toshiba), and 110 patients on scanner S2 (Revolution CT, GE Healthcare). Hounsfield units were measured using regions of interest in the descending aorta at 6 points (cranial slice, level of the visualized first, second, third, and fourth spines, and the caudal slice). We also compared the coverage length (z-axis) of the full width field of view between a single rotation of the two scanners.RESULTS: Evaluating mean CT attenuation values Hounsfield units through the scan range, are progressively reduced across the descending aorta in the S1 group, resulting in the larger difference of contrast brightness between the cranial and caudal slices compared to the S2 group (absolute difference: S2 13.0 +/- 4.4 vs S1 141.9 +/- 16.4, p < 0.0001; Percent difference: 19.3 +/- 2.1 vs -3.4 +/- 1.2, <0.0001). The standard deviation (SD) is similar at the cranial slice between the two scanners, however, the S1 group demonstrated higher SD-differential from cranial to caudal than S2 group. Median radiation exposure was significantly lower for the S2 scanner 1.50 +/- 0.75 mSv vs the S1 system 1.9 mSv (IQR 1.7-2.7 mSv) (p=0.01). Z-axis coverage was larger for the S2 scanner 152.5 mm (244 slices x 0.625 mm/slice) than 133 mm for S1 (266 slices x 0.5 mm/slice).CONCLUSION: Although both ""volume"" scanners cover the whole heart z-axis with one beat, scans using the S1 scanner have a larger variability in attenuation values throughout the scan range, resulting in 20% increase in nonuniformity from cranial to caudal slice. Additionally, SD variation across the field of view, a metric of noise, is larger when using the S1 scanner vs the S2 scanner. These results indicate that the GE Revolution CT has more uniform contrast enhancement and more coverage, lower radiation and lower image noise compared to the Toshiba Aquilion ONE Vision system.",Excluded
2972,"[Effects of radiation on capillary endothelial cells derived from Mongolian gerbil brain] Confluent monolayers of capillary endothelial cells derived from Mongolian gerbil brain were irradiated with a single exposure of x-rays, and their radiosensitivity and sequential changes in morphology, staining intensity for factor VIII-related antigen (F VIII RAg), and capacity to produce prostacyclin (PGI2) were examined. The radiobiologic parameters that characterized the dose-response survival curve for these cells were found to be n = 1.9, Dq = 140 rad, and D0 = 190 rad. Morphologically, nuclear and cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolation of cytoplasm, and giant cell formation occurred in a dose dependent manner after 24 hours from irradiation. Decreased staining intensity for F VIII RAg was observed in morphologically affected cells. The capacity to synthesize PGI2 was significantly enhanced at 24 hours, but less significant at 72 hours after irradiation. The present data suggest that the radiosensitivity of brain capillary endothelial cells may be somewhat lower than that of endothelial cells originated from larger vessels, and that radiation induced morphological and functional changes in the brain capillary endothelial cells may be quantitatively similar to the changes in endothelial cells of larger vessels.",Included
3436,"Incidence and management of late adverse radiation effects after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery Background: Late adverse radiation effects (ARE) typically occur many years after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). They are characterized by perilesional edema or cyst formation and are distinct from radiationinduced changes (RIC) noted in the first 1 to 2 years after AVM SRS and radiation necrosis. Objective(s): To determine the incidence of late ARE after AVM SRS. Method(s): Retrospective review of 233 AVM patients having SRS from 1990 to 2009. Patients had sporadic AVM, no prior radiation, and a minimum of 5 years of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up. The median MRI follow-up after SRS was 9.8 years (range, 5-24.2). Result(s): Late ARE were observed in 16 patients (6.9%) at a median of 8.7 years after SRS (range, 2.0-16.1). The 5-, 10-, and 15-year incidence of late ARE was 0.4%, 7.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. Eight patients (3.4%) were symptomatic at the time of ARE detection. Three of 8 patients who were initially asymptomatic had documented cyst progression (at 11, 40, and 42 months), for an overall symptomatic rate of 4.7%. Five patients with asymptomatic ARE have been observed for a median of 9.3 years (range, 2.0-14.1) without progression. Patients having early RIC (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, P < .001), patients having obliteration (HR=1.24, P=.02), and patients having SRS before April 1997 (HR=1.12, P=.02) weremore likely to develop late ARE.

Pain induced by these treatments is frequent and varies from one treatment to another. Chemoradiotherapy induces less pain but often more severe pain, since 20% of these situations are not controlled by strong opioids. Pain from mucositis, although nonspecific to otolaryngic cancer, is more frequent and more severe, and prevention and treatment remain poorly defined. Pain from postradiotherapeutic necrosis (mandibula, laryngeal cartilage, etc.) is less frequent, delayed, and extremely severe. Cervical and shoulder pain is present in more than one-third of patients and stems from a number of mechanisms (myofascial and articulatory). It is secondary to radiotherapy or surgery (XIth cranial nerve lesions during curage or flap reconstruction). Finally, pain coexists with disturbances of basic functions (speech, swallowing, etc.) and the disability generated by treatments.

The responsiveness to the different classes of drugs is often unsatisfactory and frequently associated to a wide range of side effects. International guidelines suggest for the ""localized"" neuropathic pain the topical treatment with 5% lidocaine medicated plaster, alone or associated to systemic drugs, as the first choice since its favorable efficacy and tolerability profile. Many clinical experiences support the rationale for using 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in different kinds of localized neuropathic pain, such as postherpetic and trigeminal neuralgia, compressive syndromes, painful diabetic polyneuropathy and pain secondary to trauma or surgical interventions. This paper reports a series of clinical cases whose heterogeneity suggests the wide burden of applicability of the topical 5% lidocaine, either alone and associated to systemic drugs. All the described conditions were characterized by a highly intense pain, not adequately controlled by actual medications, which improved after the use of topical lidocaine. The good response to lidocaine allowed the reduction, of even the withdrawal, of concurrent drugs and improved the patients' quality of life.",Excluded
2726,"Sustained ocular venous fluid shift during spaceflight may contribute to optic disc edema Purpose : The Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) is characterized by the development of optic disc edema, chorioretinal folds, globe flattening, and/or hyperopic shifts in astronauts during 6-month missions on the International Space Station (ISS). We hypothesize that a weightlessness-induced chronic headward fluid shift within the venous system contributes to these ocular changes. Methods : Astronauts (n=10) were studied before flight (seated and supine posture) and ~150 days into a 6-month mission on the ISS. Ocular and vascular measures included optical coherence tomography (OCT; Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering) assessments of sub-macular choroid thickness and peripapillary total retinal thickness (TRT; segmented from Bruch's membrane to the internal limiting membrane); ultrasound-derived internal jugular vein (IJV) cross-sectional area (GE VividQ) and non-invasive IJV pressure (Veinpress); and intraocular pressure (IOP; iCare pro pre-flight and TonoPen in-flight). Repeatedmeasures ANOVA with Tukey's post-test was used to determine the mean change between conditions; data are presented as group mean +/- standard deviation. Results : The mean IJV area increased from 9 +/- 6 mm<sup>2</sup> in the seated position to 83 +/- 27 mm<sup>2</sup> in the supine position on Earth and to 64 +/- 31 mm<sup>2</sup> during spaceflight (P<.001). Similarly, mean IJV pressure increased from 4.3 +/- 1.6 mmHg in the seated position to 16.6 +/- 5.6 mmHg in the supine position on Earth and to 14.4 +/- 5.3 mmHg in-flight (P<.001). No significant changes in sub-macular choroid thickness or TRT were detected during the acute preflight posture change, however after 150 days of weightlessness, choroid thickness increased by 50 +/- 37 mum (P<.05) and TRT increased by 26 +/- 32 mum (P=.05) relative to preflight seated values. IOP remained within a normal range in weightlessness, averaging 15.4 +/- 2.1 mmHg after 150 days of spaceflight, compared to 14.8 +/- 2.7 mmHg and 15 +/- 1.1 mmHg pre-flight in the seated and supine positions, respectively. Conclusions : Although a transient posture-induced venous fluid shift has no effect on choroidal or retinal thickness, a sustained, unrelenting cephalad fluid shift during spaceflight results in increased choroidal and retinal thickness. These data suggest that altered venous hemodynamics during spaceflight may contribute to SANS.",Excluded
2639,"New concept of a submillimetric pixellated Silicon detector for in vivo brain studies in freely moving rodents In neuroscience, well established techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI and positron-emission tomography (PET) suffer from technical limitations for the in vivo investigation of brain processes in rodents, such as low sensitivity and the need of animal restraining during image acquisition. To address the lack of adapted neuroimaging methods for awake and freely moving animals a miniature portable PET scanner directly held by the rat head has been developed recently allowing for some freedom of the rat movements when operated together with a mobility system. However, the remaining weight of such bulk apparatus may still impair the animal movements. In order to preserve the animal from any impediment to their motion activity during behavioral analysis, we propose a novel fully autonomous setup with a miniaturized beta+ radiosensitive microprobe implantable in rodent brain. The detector will permit high sensitivity local time activity measurements of radiotracers in a volume of a few mm3 while drastically limiting stress induced in the animals during acquisition. The principal architecture of the measurement setup is based on two mechanically independent parts. The first part is the head socket (Figure 1: A), it carries a pixellated 1700 mum long Silicon needle with its sensitive part implanted into the brain by stereotaxic surgery and a specific ASIC for the parallel signal processing of each pixel. It is fixed on the skull and connected via a cable to the second part, a back-board (Figure 1: B) that can be worn by the animal. This part supports the components required to drive the ASIC, those used to deliver a radio-frequency telemetric signal to the acquisition board on a PC and the power supply. The assembly is sufficiently light and small to prevent any interference with the motions of the animal during the experiments. To design the sensor, Monte-Carlo simulations have been carried out, which showed that 200 mum thick high resistivity Silicon pixels with an area of 200 mum x 500 mum are optimized in terms of beta+ sensitivity versus relative transparency to the gamma background. Several probe geometries have been investigated with simulations using technology computer-assisted design (TCAD) to determine a specific pattern of guard rings enhancing the electronic stabilization of the sensor and ensuring the electrical isolation of the pixels. Finally, two designs with two and three guard rings (total probe width of 690 and 800 mum) were implemented and the prototypes have been proved to be stable and fully operational in probe station analysis. Despite its mechanical fragility, even the only 690 mum wide, less invasive prototype showed sufficient stability for implantation in brain tissue. The physical characterization of both geometries was carried out with dedicated radioactive sources and ratio-tracer solutions. Their beta detection efficiency, their transparency to gamma rays as well as the influence of environmental parameters were determined and results compared to Monte- Carlo simulations reproducing exact probe geometries and experimental setup.

Pathologic complete response (pCR) associates with improved survival and is an outcome surrogate in NACR clinical trials. In modern phase III trials of NACR in LARC, pCR ranges 1520%. CET improves response rates in KRAS wild-type (KRAS-WT) metastatic colorectal cancer.

These rebleeds were defined both clinically and based on magnetic resonance imaging for an annual rebleeding rate of 32 episodes/492 patient-years or 6.5%. Twenty-three of the 32 rebleeding episodes occurred within 2 years after GKS. Nine episodes occurred after 2 years; thus, the annual rebleeding rate after GKS was 10.3% for the first 2 years and 3.3% thereafter (p = 0.0038). In the 45 patients with at least two bleeding episodes before GKS, the rebleeding rate dropped from 29.2% (55 episodes/188 patient-years) before treatment to 5% (10 episodes/197 patient-years) after treatment (p < 0.0001). Among the 28 patients who presented with seizures, 15 (53%) had good outcomes (Engel Grades I and II). In this study of 125 patients, symptomatic radiation-induced complications developed in only three patients.CONCLUSIONS: Gamma knife surgery can effectively reduce the rebleeding rate after the first symptomatic hemorrhage in patients with CH. In addition, GKS may be useful in reducing the severity of seizures in patients with CH.",Excluded
3220,"CT evaluation of patient deep inspiration self-breath-holding: how precisely can patients reproduce the tumor position in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices? The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reproducibility of tumor position under patient deep inspiration self-breath-holding in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices, as well as to compare the reproducibility of deep inspiration self-breath-holding on the verbal command of a radiation technologist (Passive mode) with that initiated by patients' own estimation (Active mode). Twenty patients with lung cancer were shown how the tumor and diaphragm move during the respiration cycle. Patients were instructed to hold their breath during deep inspiration and reproduce identical tumor position as well as possible either by the Active mode or by the Passive mode. After patients had practiced self-breath-holding during deep inspiration, a set of three CT scans was obtained for each of the two modes of self-breath-holding (6 CT scans total) to obtain randomly timed images of 2 mm thickness in the vicinity of the tumor. The first three scans were performed during breath-hold using the Active mode, and next three scans were using the Passive mode. Maximum difference in tumor position for the three CT scans was then calculated along three axes: cranial-caudal (C-C); anterior-posterior (A-P); and right-left (R-L). In the 20 patients who underwent analysis of self-breath-holding, mean maximum difference in tumor position obtained under breath-hold using the Active and the Passive modes were: 2.2 and 3.1 mm along the C-C axis; 1.4 and 2.4 mm along the A-P axis; and 1.3 and 2.2 mm along the R-L axis, respectively. These differences in all axes were significantly smaller (p<0.05) for the Active mode than for the Passive mode. Most tumors displayed maximal respiratory movement along the C-C axis, and minimal movement along the R-L axis, but tumors located in the upper lung displayed maximal movement along the A-P axis. Significant correlation (p<0.05) was observed between differences along three axes in either mode of breath-hold. In conclusion, the reproducibility of tumor position under self-breath-holding by patients during deep inspiration after sufficient practice and in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices was satisfactorily accurate, and differences in tumor position were smaller under breath-holding using the Active mode than using the Passive mode. We believe this new technique is likely to prove extremely useful for the irradiation of lung tumors with a small internal margin and for reduced proportion of high-dose irradiated normal lung to total lung volume.",Excluded

3072,"Coordinated regulation of circadian rhythms and homeostasis by the suprachiasmatic nucleus We have demonstrated that in rats activities of various enzymes related to gluconeogenesis and amino acid metabolism show circadian rhythms. Based on these results, we have explored the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian oscillation and phase response to light of the master clock located in the dorsomedial subdivision of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and found various proteins closely related to phase response such as BIT/SHPS-1 and those of circadian oscillation, some of which are involved in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation.On the other hand, we have presented several lines of evidence that the ventrolateral subdivision of the SCN includes not only the control center of energy supply to the brain, but also that of homeostasis such as blood glucose, blood pressure, water balance, and body temperature. We have also shown that besides these functions, the latter subdivision is involved in the regulations of hormone secretions such as insulin, glucagon, corticosterone and vasopressin. It has been also shown by electrophysiological means that light exposure to rat eye enhances sympathetic nerve activity, whereas it depresses parasympathetic nerve activity. Thus, environmental light is implicated not only in the phase-shift through the retinohypthalamic tract (RHT), but also control of autonomic nerve activities through the RHT, It is also discussed in this review how the two divisions are interconnected and how environmental light is involved in this interconnection.

Apoptosis was assessed using the annexin V binding assay, proliferation by the methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and MMP-2 secretion with zymography. The levels of phosphorylated (pEGFR) were estimated using a commercially available ELISA kit.RESULTS: Cell proliferation decreased in a dose-dependent manner, while apoptosis was increased after radiation. Doses below 2 Gy did not affect proliferation or apoptosis. MMP-2 levels were increased 48 h after radiation in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, EGFR signaling was significantly activated 15 min after radiation in a dose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Ionizing radiation activates EGFR signalling and enhances MMP-2 secretion, suggesting that the molecular pathways involved may contribute to the invasiveness and malignant behaviour of glioma cells and help to explain the response of gliomas to ionizing radiation.",Excluded
3061,"Comparing survival predicted by the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) to actual survival in patients with 1-10 brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple prognostic models for predicting survival after treatment for brain metastases have been developed. One of them, the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA), has been developed to predict the median survival for brain metastases from the most frequent primary sites: lung carcinoma, breast cancer, melanoma, renal cell cancer and gastrointestinal tumours. In this study we aim to compare the survival predicted by the DS-GPA to actual survival, and to assess this models performance on both population and individual levels.METHODS: We identified a consecutive cohort of patients treated with SRS for brain metastases in our institute. DS-GPA scores were calculated for each patient, and the median survival for each DS-GPA group was calculated. Differences in survival between DS-GPA groups were tested with Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and log-rank tests.RESULTS: In total 367 patients were included in the analysis. Median survival in our cohort is largely comparable to corresponding DS-GPA cohorts, but some notable differences are present. There was a significantly shorter median survival (15.4months, compared to 26.5months) in the adenocarcinoma NSCLC subgroup with a GPA score of 2.3-3. We confirmed the significant differences in survival time for most cancer-specific subgroups.CONCLUSION: DS-GPA seems to be a reliable tool to classify patients with brain metastases treated with SRS into prognostic subgroups. However, we found some aberrations from predicted median survival times, which may be due to specific characteristics of the populations of patients treated with SRS versus other patients.",Excluded
2787,"Efficient production of high specific activity 64Cu using a biomedical cyclotron Copper-64 (T 1/2 = 12.7 h) is an intermediate-lived positron-emitting radionuclide that is a useful radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) as well as a promising radiotherapy agent for the treatment for cancer. Currently, copper-64 suitable for biomedical studies is produced in the fast neutron flux trap (irradiation of zinc with fast neutrons) at the Missouri University Research Reactor. Access to the fast neutron flux trap is only possible on a weekly basis, making the availability of this tracer very limited. In order to significantly increase the availability of this intermediate-lived radiotracer, we have investigated and developed a method for the efficient production of high specific activity Cu-64 using a small biomedical cyclotron. It has been suggested that it may be possible to produce Cu-64 on a small biomedical cyclotron utilizing the 64Ni(p,n)64Cu nuclear reaction. We have irradiated both natural nickel and enriched (95% and 98%) Ni-64 plated on gold disks. Nickel has been electroplated successfully at thicknesses of approximately 20-300 mm and bombarded with proton currents of 15-45 microA. A special water-cooled target had been designed to facilitate the irradiations on a biomedical cyclotron up to 60 microA. We have shown that it is possible to separate Cu-64 from Ni-64 and other reaction byproducts rapidly and efficiently by using ion exchange chromatography. Production runs using 19-55 mg of 95% enriched Ni-64 have yielded 150-600 mCi of Cu-64 (2.3-5.0 mCi/microAh) with specific activities of 94-310 mci/microgram Cu. The cyclotron produced Cu-64 had been used to radiolabel PTSM [pyruvaldehyde bis-(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone), used to quantify myocardial, cerebral, renal, and tumor blood flow], MAb 1A3 [monoclonal antibody MAb to colon cancer], and octreotide. A recycling technique for the costly Ni-64 target material has been developed. This technique allows the nickel eluted off the column to be recovered and reused in the electroplating of new targets with an overall efficiency of greater than 90%.",Excluded

Also, tumor networking and intercellular communication play a major role in driving GBM therapy-resistance. Tunneling Nanotubes (TNTs), thin membranous open-ended channels connecting distant cells, have been observed in several types of cancer, where they emerge to drive a more malignant phenotype. Here, we investigated whether GBM cells are capable to intercommunicate by TNTs. Two GBM stem-like cells (GSLCs) were obtained from the external and infiltrative zone of one GBM from one patient. We show, for the first time, that both GSLCs, grown in classical 2D culture and in 3D-tumor organoids, formed functional TNTs which allowed mitochondria transfer. In the organoid model, recapitulative of several tumor's features, we observed the formation of a network between cells constituted of both Tumor Microtubes (TMs), previously observed in vivo, and TNTs. In addition, the two GSLCs exhibited different responses to irradiation in terms of TNT induction and mitochondria transfer, although the correlation with the disease progression and therapy-resistance needs to be further addressed. Thus, TNT-based communication is active in different GSLCs derived from the external tumoral areas associated to GBM relapse, and we propose that they participate together with TMs in tumor networking.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): From 1994 to 2000, 17 patients who had small recurrent breast carcinomas after initially undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT), which included postoperative radiation therapy, were treated with local tumor excision and PDR brachytherapy. Recurrences occurred at a median time of 50 months (range, 11-208 months) after primary treatment. Eight patients underwent a combination of PDR brachytherapy (total dose range, 12.5-28.0 Gy) and external-beam radiation therapy (EBT) (total dose range, 12-30 Gy). Nine patients underwent radiation therapy with 40.2-50.0-Gy PDR brachytherapy only. The prescribed radiation dose was 0.5-1.0 Gy per pulse. Patients were examined for local tumor control and treatment-related side effects. Result(s): Twelve of 17 patients had no local tumor at a median follow-up time of 59 months (range, 20-84 months); two of these patients showed signs of having distant disease. One patient died after a cerebral stroke without evidence of tumor. Four women treated with combined EBT and brachytherapy had secondary local tumor recurrences 4, 8, 8, and 11 months after therapy and had to undergo mastectomy. Despite having undergone radiation therapy previously, patients had side effects limited to moderate (grade 1-2) fibrosis. Conclusion(s): Local tumor excision combined with PDR brachytherapy for small local-regional tumor recurrences after primary BCT is feasible and well tolerated and might obviate mastectomy. Preliminary experiences are encouraging. Further studies are required for appropriate patient selection. © RSNA, 2002.",Excluded
3347,"Hitting a moving target: evolution of a treatment paradigm for atypical meningiomas amid changing diagnostic criteria OBJECT: The World Health Organization (WHO) reclassified atypical meningiomas in 2000, creating a more clear and broadly accepted definition. In this paper, the authors evaluated the pathological and clinical transition period for atypical meningiomas according to the implementation of the new WHO grading system at their institution. METHOD(S): A total of 471 meningiomas occurring in 440 patients between 1994 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed to determine changes in diagnostic rates, postoperative treatment trends, and early outcomes. RESULT(S): Between 1994 and 2000, the incidence of the atypical meningiomas ranged from 0 to 3/year, or 4.4% of the meningiomas detected during the entire period. After 2002, the annual percentage of atypical meningiomas rose over a 2-year period, leveling off at between 32.7 and 35.5% between 2004 and 2006. The authors also found a recent trend toward increased use of adjuvant radiation therapy for incompletely resected atypical meningiomas. Prior to 2003, 18.7% were treated with this therapy; after 2003, 34.4% of lesions received this treatment. Incompletely resected tumors were treated with some form of radiation 76% of the time. In cases of complete resection, most patients were not given adjuvant therapy but were expectantly managed by close monitoring using serial imaging and by receiving immediate treatment for tumor recurrence. The overall recurrence rate for expectantly managed tumors was 9% over 28.2 months, and 75% of recurrences responded to delayed radiation therapy. CONCLUSION(S): The authors documented a significant change in the proportion of meningiomas designated as atypical during a transition period from 2002 to 2004, and propose a conservative strategy for the use of radiation therapy in atypical meningiomas.",Excluded
3231,"Neuronal activity in vivo enhances functional myelin repair In demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), demyelination of neuronal fibers impairs impulse conduction and causes axon degeneration. While neuronal activity stimulates oligodendrocyte production and myelination in normal conditions, it remains unclear whether the activity of demyelinated axons restores their loss-of-function in a harmful environment. To investigate this question, we established a model to induce a moderate optogenetic stimulation of demyelinated axons in the corpus callosum at the level of the motor cortex in which cortical circuit activation and locomotor effects were reduced in adult freely moving mice. We demonstrate that a moderate activation of demyelinated axons enhances the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells onto mature oligodendrocytes, but only under a repeated stimulation paradigm. This activity-dependent increase in the oligodendrocyte pool promotes an extensive remyelination and functional restoration of conduction, as revealed by ultrastructural analyses and compound action potential recordings. Our findings reveal the need of preserving an appropriate neuronal activity in the damaged tissue to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination, likely by enhancing axon-oligodendroglia interactions. Our results provide new perspectives for translational research using neuromodulation in demyelinating diseases.",Excluded
3488,"A bayesian adaptive randomized phase ii trial of bevacizumab versus bevacizumab plus vorinostat in adults with recurrent glioblastoma final results BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab improves outcome and reduces symptoms in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). However, GBMs develop adaptive resistance to bevacizumab- mediated angiogenesis inhibition resulting in tumor recurrence. We hypothesized that vorinostat, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, with pleotropic antiangiogenic effects, would delay emergence of resistance to bevacizumab therapy and improve clinical outcome. METHOD(S): In this multicenter phase II trial utilizing a novel Bayesian design, patients with recurrent glioblastoma were adaptively randomized to bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab+vorinostat based on a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) such that patients had a higher likelihood of receiving the more efficacious treatment. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and quality of life assessment (MDASI-BT). Eligible patients were adults (>= 18 yrs) with histologically confirmed GBMs recurrent after prior radiation and temozolomide therapy, adequate organ function, KPS>= 60, and no prior bevacizumab/HDAC inhibitors. RESULT(S): Ninety patients (bevacizumab+vorinostat:49, bevacizumab:41) were enrolled and 74 were evaluable for PFS (bevacizumab+vorinostat:44, bevacizumab:30). Grade 3 or greater toxicities in 85 evaluable patients included hypertension (n=37), neurological changes (n=2), anorexia (n=2), infections (n=9), wound dehiscence (n=2), DVT/PE (n=2), and colonic perforation (n=1). There was one treatment-related death due to pulmonary embolism. Upon multivariate analysis for bevacizumab+vorinostat vs bevacizumab, median PFS (3.7 vs. 3.9 months, p=0.94, HR 0.63 [95% CI 0.38, 1.06, p=0.08]) or median OS (7.8 vs. 9.3 months, p=0.64, HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.5, 1.6, p=0.79]) were not significantly different between the two arms. Ongoing analyses of patient reported outcomes (MDASI-BT) and plasma biomarkers will be reported. CONCLUSION(S): Combining bevacizumab with vorinostat did not result in improved PFS or OS compared with bevacizumab alone in patients with recurrent GBM.

2564,"Epidemiology of intracranial meningioma Intracranial meningiomas arise from the meninges and typically have benign histologic findings. They constitute approximately 20% of all intracranial tumors. Their incidence increases with age, and they affect women more commonly than men. The annual incidence per 100,000 people ranges from two to seven for women and from one to five for men. Since the first study was published in 1970, only eight major epidemiologic studies have been done that attempted to identify risk factors for meningioma. Ionizing radiation and head trauma have emerged as the most promising etiologic risk factors. In these studies, radiation doses as low as 1-2 Gy have been associated with increased risk. The role of dental radiographs has been suggested in some studies but not supported in others. An explanation for the apparent excess of meningiomas in women remains obscure. The potential effects of endogenous or exogenous sex hormones on tumor induction or growth remain unexplored in epidemiologic studies. More should be learned about the risk factors for meningioma in search of opportunities for prevention. [References: 87]",Excluded

Materials: In this prospective study, 9 patients with CT or MR imaging of the aorta underwent diagnostic neuroangiography with AR guidance from June to August 2017. Before each procedure, segmentation software was used to create a 3D model of the patient's aortic arch including carotid and vertebral arteries. The model was deployed to HoloLens (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), a stereoscopic optical see-Through AR head-worn display. Using the AR user interface we developed, physicians manipulated a virtual 3D model intraoperatively via voice commands, gaze, and gestures while maintaining sterility. In total, 6 physicians completed 14 postoperative questionnaires assessing the system. 18 casematched retrospective controls were identified by screening for age, aorta imaging, cone-beam CT, indication, physician, and OR.

In the present study, GSM-exposed picrotoxin-pretreated rats showed differences in clinical and EEG signs, and in c-Fos expression in the brain, with respect to picrotoxin-treated rats exposed to an equivalent dose of unmodulated radiation. Neither radiation treatment caused tissue heating, so thermal effects can be ruled out. The most marked effects of GSM radiation on c-Fos expression in picrotoxin-treated rats were observed in limbic structures, olfactory cortex areas and subcortical areas, the dentate gyrus, and the central lateral nucleus of the thalamic intralaminar nucleus group. Nonpicrotoxin-treated animals exposed to unmodulated radiation showed the highest levels of neuronal c-Fos expression in cortical areas. These results suggest a specific effect of the pulse modulation of GSM radiation on brain activity of a picrotoxin-induced seizure-proneness rat model and indicate that this mobile-phone-type radiation might induce regional changes in previous preexcitability conditions of neuronal activation.",Excluded

Materials/Methods: Nine radiation oncologists (3 attendings, 6 residents) contoured the lung tumor internal target volumes (ITVs) in 6 patients using maximum intensity projection (MIP) images after 4D-CT simulation. Contouring was performed independently at 3 separate time points: prior to training based on department standards, after completing contouring training, and >2 weeks after the second session. Contouring variability was evaluated for variations in the magnitude of volumes (coefficient of variation (COV) = standard deviation/mean volume), the volume overlap (conformality index (CI) = common volume/encompassing volume), and differences in the centroid location. Contours were also compared clinically to determine radiographic features resulting in larger disagreement. Result(s): The mean volumes in cm3 for session 1, 2 and 3 were 6.52, 6.98 and 7.20 respectively. The mean COV for sessions 1 (0.25 +/- 0.05), 2 (0.24 +/- 0.04) and 3 (0.19 +/- 0.03) demonstrated significant improvement from session 1 to 3 (p = 0.03) while the CI also improved with each session, 0.35 +/-0.07, 0.36 +/-0.03 and 0.44 +/-0.04, respectively (p = 0.03 from session 1 to 3). Average differences (mm) of the mean centroid positions in the lateral, anterior-posterior, and cranial-caudal directions demonstrated decreased variability from session 1, 0.3+/-0.3, 0.3+/-0.3 and 0.5+/-0.5, to session 3, 0.2+/-0.2, 0.2+/-0.2, 0.3+/-0.3 respectively (p = ns).

Conclusion(s): While there is large variation in contoured volumes, the centroid locations show excellent agreement. Intra- is smaller than interobserver variability; both can be improved with repeat contouring and standardized training, particularly in less experienced observers. Clinically, variability was most relevant for lesions with pleural attachments and spiculae suggesting a need for a standardized approach to contour such lesions.",Excluded
2449,"Accelerated recovery of consciousness after general anesthesia is associated with increased functional brain connectivity in the high-gamma bandwidth Recent data from our laboratory demonstrate that high-frequency gamma connectivity across the cortex is present during consciousness and depressed during unconsciousness. However, these data were derived fromstatic and well-defined states of arousal rather than during transitions that would suggest functional relevance. We also recently found that subanesthetic ketamine administered during isoflurane anesthesia accelerates recovery upon discontinuation of the primary anesthetic and increases gamma power during emergence. In the current study we re-analyzed electroencephalogram (EEG) data to test the hypothesis that functional cortical connectivity between anterior and posterior cortical regions would be increased during accelerated recovery induced by ketamine when compared to saline-treated controls. Rodents were instrumented with intracranial EEG electrodes and general anesthesia was induced with isoflurane anesthesia. After 37.5 min of continuous isoflurane anesthesia, a subanesthetic dose of ketamine (25 mg/kg intraperitoneal) was administered, with evidence of a 44% reduction in emergence time. In this study, we analyzed gamma and theta coherence (measure of undirected functional connectivity) and normalized symbolic transfer entropy (measure of directed functional connectivity) between frontal and parietal cortices during various levels of consciousness, with a focus on emergence from isoflurane anesthesia. During accelerated emergence in the ketamine-treated group, there was increased frontal-parietal coherence {p = 0.005, 0.05-0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI)]} and normalized symbolic transfer entropy [frontal to parietal: p < 0.001, 0.010-0.026 (95% CI); parietal to frontal: p < 0.001, 0.009-0.025 (95% CI)] in high-frequency gamma bandwidth as compared with the saline-treated group. Surrogates of cortical information exchange in high-frequency gamma are increased in association with accelerated recovery from anesthesia. This finding adds evidence suggesting a functional significance of high-gamma information transfer in consciousness. Copyright © 2017 Li, Hambrecht-Wiedbusch and Mashour.",Excluded

NASA has scheduled deep space exploration of extraterrestrial locations such as the Moon and Mars in the 2030s. Adverse health effects related to the human exposure to microgravity from previous, relatively shorter missions have been documented.

Astronauts demonstrate a significant increase in the number of many types of circulating white blood cells (neutrophils, monocytes, T-helper cells, and B-cells) but a decrease in natural killer cells. It is unclear whether these changes are due to increased production or decreased clearance of these cells.

Median tumor volumes were 3.9 cm(3) (range, 0.8-39.0 mL) and 6.6 mL (range, 1.6-25.1 mL) for vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas, respectively. For both tumors, a median marginal dose of 13 Gy was prescribed. Median follow-up of patients was 65 months for vestibular schwannomas and 60 months for meningiomas. Patients were categorized into four groups on the basis of the tumor-brainstem relationship on neuroimaging.RESULTS: Preservation of function was stratified according to grade of brainstem compression. We analyzed the effect of radiosurgery on symptoms of brainstem compression. The tumor control rate was 100 % for meningioma and 97% for vestibular schwannomas (although 5% required an additional procedure such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt). In patients with vestibular schwannoma, serviceable hearing was preserved in 72.0%. Balance improved in 31.9%, remained unchanged in 56.5%, and deteriorated in 11.6% of patients who had imbalance at presentation. Balance improved significantly in patients who had less tumor compression (p = 0.0357) after radiosurgery. Symptoms improved in 43.2% of patients with meningioma.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a minimally invasive option for patients with benign basal tumors that indent or distort the brainstem. A high tumor growth control rate and satisfactory rate of neurological preservation and symptom control can be obtained with radiosurgery.",Excluded

On the 72nd hour after irradiation with 900 R there is no essential change in the dopamine level in brain and the striatum; apomorphine raises the dopamine level in brain and striatum; the effect of L-DOPA and its combination with apomorphine is potentiated with respect to the increase of the dopamine level in brain and striatum.",Included
2522,"Anatomical, functional and molecular biomarker applications of magnetic resonance neuroimaging MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) along with computed tomography and PET are the most common imaging modalities used in the clinics to detect structural abnormalities and pathological conditions in the brain. MRI generates superb image resolution/contrast without radiation exposure that is associated with computed tomography and PET; MRS and spectroscopic imaging technologies allow us to measure changes in brain biochemistry. Increasingly, neurobiologists and MRI scientists are collaborating to solve neuroscience problems across sub-cellular through anatomical levels. To achieve successful cross-disciplinary collaborations, neurobiologists must have sufficient knowledge of magnetic resonance principles and applications in order to effectively communicate with their MRI colleagues. This review provides an overview of magnetic resonance techniques and how they can be used to gain insight into the active brain at the anatomical, functional and molecular levels with the goal of encouraging neurobiologists to include MRI/MRS as a research tool in their endeavors.",Excluded
2536,"Increased light exposure alleviates one form of photoreceptor degeneration marked by elevated calcium in the dark BACKGROUND: In one group of gene mutations that cause photoreceptor degeneration in human patients, guanylyl cyclase is overactive in the dark. The ensuing excess opening of cGMP-gated cation channels causes intracellular calcium to rise to toxic levels. The Y99C mutation in guanylate cyclase-activating protein 1 (GCAP1) has been shown to act this way. We determined whether prolonged light exposure, which lowers cGMP levels through activation of phototransduction, might protect photoreceptors in a line of transgenic mice carrying the GCAP1-Y99C.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We reared cohorts of GCAP1-Y99C transgenic mice under standard cyclic, constant dark and constant light conditions. Mouse eyes were analyzed by histology and by immunofluorescence for GFAP upregulation, a non-specific marker for photoreceptor degeneration. Full-field electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded to assess retinal function. Consistent with our hypothesis, constant darkness accelerated disease, while continuous lighting arrested photoreceptor degeneration.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast to most forms of retinal degeneration, which are exacerbated by increased exposure to ambient light, a subset with mutations that cause overly active guanylyl cyclase and high intracellular calcium benefitted from prolonged light exposure. These findings may have therapeutic implications for patients with these types of genetic defects.",Excluded
2447,"Unmyelinated visceral afferents exhibit frequency dependent action potential broadening while myelinated visceral afferents do not Sensory information arising from visceral organ systems is encoded into action potential trains that propagate along afferent fibers to target nuclei in the central nervous system. These information streams range from tight patterns of action potentials that are well synchronized with the sensory transduction event to irregular, patternless discharge with no clear correlation to the sensory input. In general terms these afferent pathways can be divided into unmyelinated and myelinated fiber types. Our laboratory has a long standing interest in the functional differences between these two types of afferents in terms of the preprocessing of sensory information into action potential trains (synchrony, frequency, duration, etc.), the reflexogenic consequences of this sensory input to the central nervous system and the ionic channels that give rise to the electrophysiological properties of these unique cell types. The aim of this study was to determine whether there were any functional differences in the somatic action potential characteristics of unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents in response to different rates of sensory nerve stimulation. Our results showed that activity and frequency-dependent widening of the somatic action potential was quite prominent in unmyelinated but not myelinated vagal afferents. Spike broadening often leads to increased influx of Ca(2+) ions that has been associated with a diverse range of modulatory mechanisms both at the cell body and central synaptic terminations (e.g. increased neurotransmitter release.) We conclude that our observations are indicative of fundamentally different mechanisms for neural integration of sensory information arising from unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents.",Excluded
3113,"Cerebral irradiation as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of small cell carcinoma of the lung. [French] The authors present the results of a randomized study of 33 patients suffering from small cell carcinoma of the lung. After a similar course of monthly chemo-therapy (Endoxan, Oncovin, Natulan, CCNU) and mediastinal irradiation in a dose of 30 grays in 10 fractions over 2 weeks, 14 patients were given adjuvant cerebral irradiation, the 19 others made up the control group (30 grays to the brain overall in 10 fractions over 2 weeks). With a minimum follow up for 12 months, 42% of the control group had evidence of cerebral secondaries, as opposed to none in the irradiated group with no neurological signs whatsoever. The indisputable efficacy of adjuvant cerebral irradiation contrasts with the absence of any significant improvement in survival time: 2 patients are alive and in complete remission, 1 in each group, while the mean survival was 12.3 and 11.7 months respectively. This is explained by the continued occurrence of extra-cerebral metastatic deposits such as in the liver or mediastinum where the efficacy of systemic therapy remains uncertain. The therapeutic approach is currently orientated in 2 directions: to raise to dose delivered to the mediastinum even if it appears radiologically normal, and to continue research into new chemo-therapeutic combinations more specifically active at the hepatic level.",Excluded
2531,"Management of patients with oligometastatic/ resectable stage IV NSCLC For the past decade, the standard first-line therapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with adequate ECOG performance status (<2) has been platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with a reported median overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months, which has slightly improved to 12 months with the addition of bevacizumab. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, gefitinib and erlotinib, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, crizotinib, have been shown to provide longer progression-free survival (PFS) and fewer side effects as first-line therapy, compared with chemotherapy in patients with certain histological subtypes and activating mutations. However, despite therapeutic developments, palliative treatment is standard for many stage IV NSCLC patients and the prognosis remains poor, with relative 5-year survival rates <=4%, compared with an average of approximately 17% for all patients with NSCLC. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a subgroup of stage IV NSCLC with a limited number/ number of sites of metastatic disease, usually 1-5 metastatic lesions. While only a small subset of patients present with such limited metastases (brain metastasis <50%, adrenal gland metastasis ~7%), they may be suitable for, and achieve long-term survival following, eradication of both the primary and metastatic tumours. For example, reported 5-year survival rates for NSCLC patients with solitary brain or adrenal metastasis who underwent surgical removal of both primary lung and metastatic disease ranged from 7-24% and 25-34%, respectively, which is higher than the average of <=4% for all stage IV NSCLC patients. In addition to having an adequate performance status, there are additional key prognostic factors for identifying oligometastatic NSCLC patients likely to benefit from aggressive therapy; staging of the metastatic lesions, lymph node involvement and status of the primary lung tumour. A lower number of metastatic sites is predictive of good clinical outcome, with >2 metastatic sites associated with shorter PFS. The organ involved in metastatic spread may also impact clinical outcome as, for instance, patients with brain and adrenal gland metastases are more suitable for surgical intervention compared with bone or liver. Given the importance of number and site of metastatic lesions, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are vital for accurate staging of oligometastatic disease. An association between N0 disease and increased long-term survival compared with N1/N2 disease has been observed. For example, following surgical treatment of one cohort of patients with solitary NSCLC adrenal gland metastasis, those with N2 disease had 0% median 5-year survival rate, compared with 52% for N0/N1 patients (P=0.001). Pathologic staging of lymph nodes is therefore critical. The status of the primary lung tumour also impacts clinical outcome, as the primary tumour must itself be resectable. Stage III primary disease is associated with worse survival outcome than stage I or II in patients undergoing surgical excision of brain and adrenal gland metastases, with a reported 5-year survival rate of 0% for stage III, compared with 63% and 77% for stage I and II, respectively. Similarly, patients with oligometastatic disease and a controlled primary site, or 'oligorecurrance', have better prognosis than those with an uncontrolled primary tumour. Histological subtype of NSCLC may also impact prognosis in oligometastatic NSCLC, with adenocarcinoma associated with the most favourable outcomes. Although an optimal disease-free interval (DFI) to define synchronous and metachronous disease has not been agreed upon, synchronous oligometastasis is generally associated with poorer survival outcomes. Patients receiving adrenalectomy for oligometastatic NSCLC with DFI <=6 months had median OS of 12 months versus 31 months for DFI >6 months. Similar results were reported for isolated brain metastasis. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a stage IV cancer and as a guiding principle therapy should be simple and minimally invasive. Furthermore, given the diffuse nature of this disease state, management should ideally involve a multidisciplinary team as the primary and metastatic cancer must be treated, requiring a wide range of expertise. Surgery and radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] in the brain and stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] in extracranial sites) are the two most common methods of tumour ablation. In general, radiosurgery is less invasive than surgery and is therefore useful for patients ineligible for surgery. Additionally, evidence suggests SBRT may be more applicable to limited extracranial metastasis to multiple organs compared with surgery. The treatment of limited brain metastases has been evaluated through several randomised clinical trials. Surgical resection plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of oligometastasis in the brain led to significantly prolonged OS compared with WBRT alone - as high as 40 weeks in one trial, compared with 15 weeks for WBRT (P<0.01). Further, a study of SRS with WBRT in patients with 1-4 brain metastases showed improved survival outcomes for patients with solitary brain metastases and improved clinical outcomes for patients with >1 site of metastatic disease, compared with WBRT alone. Overall, SRS plus WBRT is considered an acceptable choice for those patients with limited brain metastasis who are not suitable for surgery. Adrenalectomy is the standard of care for adrenal gland metastases, with OS ranging from 11-31 months. There have been no randomised trials of the use of SBRT in the adrenal gland setting, although one retrospective study reported OS of 23 months for isolated adrenal metastases treated with SBRT. Further, a recent review article of extracranial oligometastatic disease from various primary cancers suggests that survival following SBRT compares favourably to surgery. One of the key challenges for the management of oligometastatic NSCLC is continuing to improve diagnosis and prognostic factors to more accurately identify those patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who are likely to benefit from ablative treatment, as well as distinguish truly isolated metastatic disease from early-stage metastasis that later develops into widely disseminated disease. Continuing advances in imaging technology will play a role in refining diagnosis and prognosis. From a treatment perspective, challenges include cognitive problems associated with WBRT and the current lack of randomised trial data comparing surgery, radiosurgery and standard of care. To this end, there are several ongoing clinical trials, such as the randomized SABR-COMET study, which compares palliative radiation with stereotactic ablative radiation for <=3 metastatic tumours to any single organ.",Excluded
3023,"[Late radiation changes after small volume radiosurgery of the rat brain. Measuring local cerebral blood flow and histopathological studies] BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate late effects following stereotactic single fraction and small volume irradiation on cerebral blood flow and histologic alterations in the rat brain parenchyma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 Copenhagen rats, separated into eleven groups of six animals each received single doses of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 Gy using a 15 MV linear accelerator. Six rats served as controls. Two cylindrical collimators of 2 mm and 3 mm aperture were used. The diameters of the spherical 80% isodose were 3.7 and 4.7 mm, respectively (Table 1). Irradiation was applied to a predefined area in the right frontal lobe. 19 months after irradiation local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method in one animal of each dose group between 20 and 50 Gy. 9 and 19 months after irradiation, half of the animals of each group were sacrificed for brain histology. All animals irradiated with 100 Gy were sacrificed 7 months after irradiation.RESULTS: An increase of local cerebral blood flow was measured in brain structures within the 80% isodose in animals irradiated with 50 Gy (Figure 3) compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Measurements close to necrotic areas showed a strong decrease of local cerebral blood flow (Figure 1). A volume increase of the irradiated hemisphere was seen after 19 months (Figure 2). The histologic examination after 19 months showed necrotic areas in the 30-50 Gy groups (Figure 4b) but not in the 20 Gy groups (Figure 4c). The animals who received 100 Gy demonstrated brain necrosis within 9 months after irradiation (Figure 4a). At both points in time the groups irradiated with the 3-mm collimator showed more pronounced histomorphologic and functional changes compared to the groups irradiated with the 2-mm collimator.CONCLUSION: Alterations of the local cerebral blood flow were measured as a late effect after single dose irradiation. The alterations of the local cerebral blood flow could be explained by the histomorphologic changes of the blood vessels. Using a semi-quantitative classification a dose, time and volume dependence for the endpoint radionecrosis was seen.",Included
3290,"Caries clinical trial of a remineralising toothpaste in radiation patients OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of a specially formulated remineralising toothpaste in controlling caries in a high-risk population: head and neck radiation patients.DESIGN: The study compared the performance of the remineralising toothpaste with a conventional fluoride dentifrice using double-blind randomisation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test products: The products compared contained equivalent quantities of fluoride (1100 p.p.m.). The dual-phase remineralising toothpaste, Enamelon, also delivered soluble calcium and phosphate ions, essential components of teeth, from separate phases. Both groups had all caries restored at baseline and used a fluoride rinse daily.SUBJECTS: Fifty-seven subjects who received radiation to the head and neck causing saliva hypofunction, entered the study, while 44 completed the 10-12 month visit.MEASUREMENTS: Examinations included coronal and root caries using the Pitts Diagnostic Criteria, salivary flow rate, plaque and gingival indices and microbiological counts over a 1-year period.RESULTS: The average net increment per year for root caries per subject was 0.04 (+/-.052) in subjects completing the study using the remineralising toothpaste and 1.65 (+/-0.51) for root caries in subjects completing the study using the conventional fluoride dentifrice. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.03), suggesting lower net root surface increment/year for the remineralising toothpaste relative to the conventional toothpaste. No significant differences were noted on coronal surfaces.CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the remineralising toothpaste provides a significant benefit in preventing and remineralising root caries in high-risk patients.",Excluded
2756,"A randomized phase III trial of cisplatin and tumor volume directed irradiation followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel vs. carboplatin and paclitaxel for optimally debulked, advanced endometrial carcinoma Background: Patients with stage III/IVA uterine cancer (UC) carry high risk of systemic and local recurrence. Chemotherapy was shown to reduce systemic recurrence, however the risk of local failure remains high. Method(s): The primary endpoint of this open label, randomized phase III trial was to determine if treatment with cisplatin and volume-directed radiation followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel for 4 cycles (C-RT, experimental arm) reduces the rate of recurrence or death (i.e., increases recurrence-free survival, RFS) when compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel for 6 cycles (CT, control arm) in patients with stages III-IVA (<2 cm residual disease) or FIGO 2009 stage I/II serous or clear cell UC and positive cytology. Secondary objectives were assessment of overall survival (OS), acute and late toxicities, and quality of life. A 28.5% reduction in the rate of recurrence or death was considered significant. Treatment randomization and analysis were stratified by gross residual tumor and age. Result(s): Between 6/2009 and 7/2014, 813 patients were enrolled and randomized (407 C-RT and 406-CT). Of those, 733 were eligible (344 C-RT and 360 CT), and 680 received the trial intervention (333 C-RT and 347 CT). Median follow up is 47 months. Patients characteristics were balanced between arms. There were 201 (58%) > grd 3 toxicity events in the C-RT arm and 227 (63%) in the CT arm. The most common > grd 3 events were myelosupression (40% vs. 52%), gastrointestinal (13% vs. 4%), metabolic (15% vs. 19%), neurological (7% vs. 6%), infectious (4% vs. 5%). Treatment hazard ratio for RFS was 0.9 (C-RT vs. CT; CI 0.74 to 1.10). C-RT reduced the incidence of vaginal (3% vs. 7%, HR = 0.36, CI 0.16 to 0.82), pelvic and paraaortic recurrences (10% vs. 21%, HR=0.43, CI 02.8 to 0.66) compared to CT, but distant recurrences were more common with C-RT vs. CT (28% vs. 21%, HR 1.36, CI 1 to 1.86). The analysis is premature for OS comparison. Conclusion(s): Although C-RT reduced the rate of local recurrence compared to CT; the combined modality regimen did not increase RFS in optimally debulked, stage III/IVA UC.",Excluded

2905,"Helping patients with localized prostate carcinoma manage uncertainty and treatment side effects: nurse-delivered psychoeducational intervention over the telephone BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an individualized uncertainty management intervention delivered by telephone to Caucasian and African-American men with localized prostate carcinoma and directed at managing the uncertainties of their disease and treatment.METHODS: The authors delivered a psychoeducational intervention by phone to men with prostate carcinoma, with or without supplemented delivery to a close family member, that was directed at managing uncertainty and improving symptom control. One hundred thirty-four Caucasian men and 105 African-American men were assigned randomly to one of two approaches to delivering the intervention or to the control condition. Men entered the study immediately after surgical treatment or in the first 3 weeks of radiation therapy. Trained nurses delivered the intervention through weekly phone calls for 8 weeks.RESULTS: The authors found that the majority of intervention effects were from baseline to 4 months postbaseline, when treatment side effects are most intense. Both Caucasian men and African-American men who received either one of the two approaches for delivering the intervention improved in the two uncertainty management methods of cognitive reframing and problem solving. Similarly, when the intervention groups were combined, men who received the intervention also improved significantly in control of incontinence by 4 months postbaseline. Decreases in the number of treatment side effects differed by time and treatment/ ethnic group interactions as did satisfaction with sexual functioning.CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first tests of a psychoeducational intervention among men with prostate carcinoma and was the first test that included a sufficient number of African-American men to test by ethnic group.

3539,"Functional protection of photoreceptors from light-induced damage by dimethylthiourea and Ginkgo biloba extract PURPOSE: To investigate the functional protective effect of a synthetic (dimethylthiourea, DMTU) and a natural antioxidant (Ginkgo biloba extract, EGb 761) against light-induced retinal degeneration.METHODS: Wistar rats were exposed for 24 hours to 1700-lux light after treatment with DMTU or EGb 761. Electroretinograms were recorded before and on day (D)1, D3, D8, D15, D22, and D29 after light exposure. The b-wave amplitude was plotted against log L (ganzfeld luminance), providing the b-wave sensitivity curve. The Naka-Rushton function fitted to the sensitivity curve enabled derivation of the parameters Bmax (saturated amplitude) and K (luminance-inducing Bmax/2). In addition, rats from each group were killed for retinal morphometric analyses.RESULTS: In the untreated group, light exposure caused collapse of the b-wave sensitivity curves. Bmax was reduced by 51% at D1 without subsequent recovery. K increased temporarily, reverting to normal values 8 days later. The outer nuclear layer thicknesses decreased markedly in the superior retina. In the treated groups, light exposure had a weaker effect on sensitivity curves. The values of Bmax were not significantly different from those in the unexposed-untreated group, although K increased temporarily. Retinal morphometry was preserved.CONCLUSIONS: Dimethylthiourea and EGb 761 afford functional protection against light-induced retinal damage.",Excluded
