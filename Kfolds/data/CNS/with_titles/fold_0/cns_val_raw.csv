1094,"Platelet aggregation in acute coronary syndromes: use of a new aggregometer with laser light scattering to assess platelet aggregability OBJECTIVE: Platelet aggregation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes. Small aggregates consisting of < or = 100 platelets cannot be quantified with a conventional aggregometer employing optical density. Using a recently developed aggregometer based on laser light scattering, we studied platelet aggregability in patients with acute coronary syndromes.METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 39 patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina who had received no prior antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, to be assayed immediately using a PA-100 platelet aggregometer. Blood samples from 14 healthy volunteers were used as controls.RESULTS: Spontaneous formation of platelet aggregates was observed only in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The size of these aggregates was small, consisting of < or = 100 platelets (primary aggregation). Agonist-induced aggregation consisted of two phases. In the first few minutes, the number of small aggregates increased markedly (primary aggregation), followed by an increase in larger aggregates (secondary aggregation). The EC50 of epinephrine for primary aggregation was nearly 50 times lower in acute coronary patients than in controls (P < 0.001), while the EC50 for secondary aggregation was only 2 times lower (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Aggregometry using light scattering suggests that platelet hyperaggregability and hypersensitivity in acute coronary syndromes may occur in primary but not secondary aggregation.",Excluded
1191,"Randomized, prospective, and controlled clinical trial of pulsed electromagnetic field stimulation for cervical fusion Background context: Multilevel fusions, the use of allograft bone, and smoking have been associated with an increased risk of nonunion after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation has been shown to increase arthrodesis rates after lumbar spine fusion surgery, but there are minimal data concerning the effect of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. Purpose(s): To determine the efficacy and safety of PEMF stimulation as an adjunct to arthrodesis after ACDF in patients with potential risk factors for nonunion. Study design: A randomized, controlled, prospective multicenter clinical trial. Patient Sample: Three hundred and twenty-three patients with radiographic evidence (computed tomography-myelogram [CT-myelo] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of a compressed cervical nerve root and symptomatic radiculopathy appropriate to the compressed root that had failed to respond to nonoperative management were enrolled in the study. The patients were either smokers (more than one pack per day) and/or were undergoing multilevel fusions. All patients underwent ACDF using the Smith-Robinson technique. Allograft bone and an anterior cervical plate were used in all cases. Outcome measures: Measurements were obtained preoperatively and at each postoperative interval and included neurologic assessment, visual analog scale (VAS) scores for shoulder/arm pain at rest and with activity, SF-12 scores, the neck disability index (NDI), and radiographs (anteroposterior, lateral, and flexion-extension views). Two orthopedic surgeons not otherwise affiliated with the study and blinded to treatment group evaluated the radiographs, as did a blinded radiologist. Adverse events were reported by all patients throughout the study to determine device safety. Method(s): Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those receiving PEMF stimulation after surgery (PEMF group, 163 patients) and those not receiving PEMF stimulation (control group, 160 patients). Postoperative care was otherwise identical. Follow-up was carried out at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Result(s): The PEMF and control groups were comparable with regard to age, gender, race, past medical history, smoking status, and litigation status. Both groups were also comparable in terms of baseline diagnosis (herniated disc, spondylosis, or both) and number of levels operated (one, two, three, or four). At 6 months postoperatively, the PEMF group had a significantly higher fusion rate than the control group (83.6% vs. 68.6%, p=.0065). At 12 months after surgery, the stimulated group had a fusion rate of 92.8% compared with 86.7% for the control group (p=.1129). There were no significant differences between the PEMF and control groups with regard to VAS pain scores, NDI, or SF-12 scores at 6 or 12 months. No significant differences were found in the incidence of adverse events in the groups. Conclusion(s): This is the first randomized, controlled trial that analyzes the effects of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. PEMF stimulation significantly improved the fusion rate at 6 months postoperatively in patients undergoing ACDF with an allograft and an anterior cervical plate, the eligibility criteria being patients who were smokers or had undergone multilevel cervical fusion. At 12 months postoperatively, however, the fusion rate for PEMF patients was not significantly different from that of the control group. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events in the two groups, indicating that the use of PEMF stimulation is safe in this clinical setting. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

274,"Pulsed infrared releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum of cultured spiral ganglion neurons Inner ear spiral ganglion neurons were cultured from day 4 postnatal mice and loaded with a fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (fluo-4, -5F, or -5N). Pulses of infrared radiation (IR; 1,863 nm, 200 micros, 200-250 Hz for 2-5 s, delivered via an optical fiber) produced a rapid, transient temperature increase of 6-12degreeC (above a baseline of 24-30degreeC). These IR pulse trains evoked transient increases in both nuclear and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) of 0.20-1.4 microM, with a simultaneous reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in regions containing endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IR-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] continued in medium containing no added Ca<sup>2+</sup> (+/-Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers) and low [Na<sup>+</sup>], indicating that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase was mediated by release from intracellular stores. Consistent with this hypothesis, the IR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] response was prolonged and eventually blocked by inhibition of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase with cyclopiazonic acid, and was also inhibited by a high concentration of ryanodine and by inhibitors of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>)-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (xestospongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate). The thermal sensitivity of the response suggested involvement of warmth-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. The IR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase was inhibited by TRPV4 inhibitors (HC-067047 and GSK-2193874), and immunostaining of spiral ganglion cultures demonstrated the presence of TRPV4 and TRPM2 that colocalized with ER marker GRP78. These results suggest that the temperature sensitivity of IR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] elevations is conferred by TRP channels on ER membranes, which facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux into the cytosol and thereby contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release via IP<sub>3</sub> and ryanodine receptors. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Infrared radiation-induced photothermal effects release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum of primary spiral ganglion neurons. This Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is mediated by activation of transient receptor potential (TRPV4) channels and involves amplification by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release. The neurons immunostained for warmth-sensitive channels, TRPV4 and TRPM2, which colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum. Pulsed infrared radiation provides a novel experimental tool for releasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, studying Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory mechanisms, and influencing neuronal excitability.",Excluded
40,"Diffusion tensor imaging contributes to differentiate richardson's syndrome from progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism Objective: To investigate the regional distribution of white matter (WM) damage in patients with Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism (PSP-P) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and quantify the DTI classificatory ability in diagnosing PSP syndromes, when used in combination with infratentorial volumetry. Background Abnormal DTI measures of the superior cerebellar peduncles were reported in PSP-RS patients. A few studies showed that PSP-RS patients had DTI alterations also in the corpus callosum, internal capsulae, and long-range WM tracts. However, most of the previous studies did not include the atypical clinical presentations of PSP. Design/Methods: In 37 PSP (21 PSP-RS, 16 PSP-P) and 42 controls, tract-based spatial statistics was applied. DTI metrics were derived from supratentorial, thalamic, and infratentorial tracts. Brain atrophy was investigated using voxel-based morphometry. The MR parkinsonism index (MRPI), a combined conventional MRI measurement taking into account the midbrain and pons areas and the SCP and middle cerebellar peduncle widths, was calculated. Result(s): In PSP, grey matter (GM) atrophy involved fronto-temporal lobes and basal ganglia, and was greater in PSP-RS than PSP-P. PSP-RS had a more severe and distributed WM loss, including the midbrain, SCP, and prefrontal and motor/premotor regions. All PSP harboured diffusivity abnormalities in the corpus callosum, fronto-parietal and fronto-temporo-occipital tracts. Infratentorial WM and thalamic radiations were severely affected in PSP-RS and relatively spared in PSP-P. When MRPI and DTI measures were combined, the discriminatory power increased from 0.92 to 0.98 for PSP-RS vs. controls, from 0.70 to 0.82 for PSP-P vs. controls, and from 0.77 to 0.84 for PSP-RS vs. PSP-P. Conclusion(s): Distinct patterns of GM and WM alterations occur in PSP-RS and PSP-P. Adding DTI measures to MRPI improves the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating each PSP syndrome from healthy individuals and each other.",Excluded
565,"Open-label, randomized phase II, of concurrent whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and capecitabine (Xelodaw) followed by maintenance capecitabine compared with standard wbrt in breast cancer patients with newly diagnosed brain metastasis: The xerad trial BACKGROUND: Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is considered as the standard of care for breast cancer patients (pts) with CNS metastasis. The role of chemotherapy in these patients is still not clearly defined. Capecitabine (Xelodaw) alone has shown some efficacy, and the use of capecitabine concurrent with WBRT has been suggested as a radiosensitizer. This trial was design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine administered concurrently with WBRT, compared to WBRT. METHOD(S): In this multicenter, national, phase II study, 130 pts were planned to be randomized in two arms: Arm A: WBRT (3000 cGy in 10 single daily fractions) followed by standard of care (capecitabine and 5-FU analogues not allowed); Arm B: WBRT and concurrent capecitabine (825 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/twice daily X 14days) followed by capecitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/ twice daily, days 1-14 every 21 days) as maintenance treatment. The main inclusion criteria were: age over 18, ECOG performance status 0 - 2, histologically confirmed breast cancer, newly diagnosed CNS metastasis non eligible for surgery or radiosurgery, no previous treatment for CNS metastases, and no treatment with capecitabine at time of inclusion. The primary objective was the best objective partial or complete CNS response rate according to RECIST criteria after central review. Secondary criteria included overall survival and safety. RESULT(S): The study was terminated earlier due to a slow recruitment rate over a 1 yearperiod. The ITT population comprised 23 patients: 12 in Arm A and 11 in Arm B. The majority of the patients (78%) presented with invasive ductal carcinomas. Patients in Arm B were slightly more limited: 27% were fully active compared to 46% of the patients in Arm A. The objective CNS response rate was higher in arm B (36%) than in arm A (25%) but the median overall survival was higher in arm A (9.8 months - 95%CI[4.3-17.0]) than in arm B (4.6 months - 95%CI[2.3-8.9]). The most frequently reported AEs were headaches (6 pts in each arm ), asthenia (7 pts in arm A, 5 in arm B), nausea (4 pts in arm A, 5 in arm B), scalp radiation reactions (6 pts in arm A, 2 in arm B); vomiting (1 pt in arm A, 6 in arm B) and diarrheas (1 pt in arm A, 3 in arm B). Twelve patients (52%), six in each arm, experienced SAEs. The most frequent SAE was ""general physical health deterioration"" (three patients). Two SAEs were considered related to capecitabine: colitis and pulmonary embolism and led to permanent treatment discontinuation and one SAE in Arm B was considered related to WBRT: depressed level of consciousness. Capecitabine was generally well tolerated, nausea being the most frequent AE leading to dose reduction and three patients had to stop the treatment because of capecitabine-related AEs. CONCLUSION(S): This trial revealed no safety signal for concomitant treatment with WBRT and Capecitabine. Unfortunately, the limited number of patients included in this study impedes any definitive conclusion on efficacy.",Excluded
1055,"The pressure difference between eye and brain changes with posture OBJECTIVE: The discovery of a posture-dependent effect on the difference between intraocular pressure (IOP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) at the level of lamina cribrosa could have important implications for understanding glaucoma and idiopathic intracranial hypertension and could help explain visual impairments in astronauts exposed to microgravity. The aim of this study was to determine the postural influence on the difference between simultaneously measured ICP and IOP.METHODS: Eleven healthy adult volunteers (age = 46 +/- 10 years) were investigated with simultaneous ICP, assessed through lumbar puncture, and IOP measurements when supine, sitting, and in 9degree head-down tilt (HDT). The trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference (TLCPD) was calculated as the difference between the IOP and ICP. To estimate the pressures at the lamina cribrosa, geometrical distances were estimated from magnetic resonance imaging and used to adjust for hydrostatic effects.RESULTS: The TLCPD (in millimeters of mercury) between IOP and ICP was 12.3 +/- 2.2 for supine, 19.8 +/- 4.6 for sitting, and 6.6 +/- 2.5 for HDT. The expected 24-hour average TLCPD on earth-assuming 8 hours supine and 16 hours upright-was estimated to be 17.3mmHg. By removing the hydrostatic effects on pressure, a corresponding 24-hour average TLCPD in microgravity environment was simulated to be 6.7mmHg.INTERPRETATION: We provide a possible physiological explanation for how microgravity can cause symptoms similar to those seen in patients with elevated ICP. The observed posture dependency of TLCPD also implies that assessment of the difference between IOP and ICP in upright position may offer new understanding of the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and glaucoma.

1117,"Celecoxib combined with hippocampus sparing intensity-modulated radiation therapy reduces the injury of cognitive function induced by radiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Objective: In this study, we compared the effects of combination of celecoxib, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and hippocampal sparing, IMRT with hippocampal sparing and IMRT only on cognitive function, life quality and therapeutic effects in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): From June 2015 to December 2016, 177 cases with NPC in our hospital were finally enrolled and randomly divided into three groups: IMRT only group (I group), hippocampal sparing IMRT (H group) and celecoxib combined with hippocampal sparing IMRT group (Ce group). Cognitive function and life quality were evaluated three months after treatment via Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ C30) respectively. Indicators for therapeutic effects including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), adverse reactions, recurrence and metastasis of tumor and serum tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of patients were also compared. Result(s): Before the intervention, there was no difference in cognitive function score among all the patients (P=0.876). After the treatment, no significant difference was found for RR among groups (P=0.245), however, patients in the Ce group showed the highest cognitive function score (P<0.001); the differences in adverse reactions including dry mouth (P=0.026, Ce vs. H; P=0.000, Ce vs. I; P=0.000, H vs. I), oral mucositis (P=0.060, Ce vs. H; P=0.008, Ce vs. I; P=0.396, H vs. I), skin reaction (P=0.654, Ce vs. H; P=0.027, Ce vs. I; P=0.065, H vs. I), irradiation otitis media (P=0.097, Ce vs. H; P=0.009, Ce vs. I; P=0.051, H vs. I) had statistical significance, and their incidence rates in Ce group were lowest. Meanwhile, recurrence and metastasis were less in the Ce group although the differences were insignificant (P=0.302 and 0.638). The serum level of CEA was notably lower in Ce group (P=0.031, Ce vs. H; P=0.020, Ce vs. I; P=0.512, H vs. I). Life quality scores about cognitive function and role function of H group and Ce group were higher than that of I group while Ce group was the highest (Cognitive function: P=0.020, Ce vs. H; P=0.015, Ce vs. I and P=0.023, H vs. I; role function: P=0.039, Ce vs. H; P=0.011, Ce vs. I and P=0.031, H vs. I). Conclusion(s): Celecoxib combined with hippocampus sparing IMRT for the treatment of NPC patients could drastically alleviate cognitive dysfunction, improve life quality and reduce the occurrence of adverse events compared with hippocampal sparing IMRT and IMRT only.

263,"Inefficiency of the anticoagulant therapy in the regression of the radiation-induced optic neuropathy in Cushing's disease Radiation-induced optic neuropathy is a rare complication (prevalence less than 1%) following radiotherapy of the sellar region. However, the vasculopathy in Cushing's disease predisposes to radiation-induced injury. We report the case of a 24-year-old man with Cushing's disease since he was 16. The hormonal study including bilateral inferior petrosal sinus catheterization diagnosed a pituitary right lesion, but imagiology was always negative. He underwent a transsphenoidal microadenomectomy and the pathological study showed the presence of corticotrophic hyperplasia but no adenoma. Secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadism as well as permanent diabetes insipidus were diagnosed and because the patient was not cured he underwent a second transsphenoidal total hypophysectomy. After that and because he was still hypercortisolemic, pituitary external irradiation was given in a total dose of 6000 rad. Six months later he developed progressive bilateral visual loss. Cerebral MR revealed focal enhancement of the enlarged optic nerves and chiasm, associated with demyelination areas of the posterior visual pathways. Treatment was tried first with high doses of corticosteroids and later with anticoagulants-heparin EV. 1000 U/h during 7 days followed by warfarin, but unsuccessfully, probably because the patient was already amaurotic at the beginning of the last treatment.",Excluded
348,"Radiation doses to patients in neurointerventional procedures PURPOSE: To evaluate stochastic and deterministic risks associated with neurointerventional procedures for the patient.METHODS: Eight neurovascular interventional procedures were evaluated to determine the entrance skin dose and effective dose for the patient. Dosimetry was done with thermoluminescence dosimeters. The highest dose on the patient's head was recorded as the maximum entrance skin dose. The equivalent dose was obtained by conversion of the dose-area product using published conversion tables.RESULTS: The maximum entrance skin dose varied from 129 to 1335 mGy. The mean effective dose was 1.67 mSv with a range of 0.44 to 3.44 mSv. No deterministic effect has been encountered. Stochastic risk linked to the highest effective dose value was approximately one death by fatal cancer for every 6000 procedures, according to the new International Commission on Radiological Protection coefficient.CONCLUSIONS: Because no deterministic effect has been detected, and stochastic risks were very low, radiation hazard to the patient is a minor consideration in deciding whether to undertake a neurointerventional procedure.",Excluded
1104,"Patterns of care for patients with small cell lung cancer: A survey of German radiation oncology institutions on recommendations for prophylactic cranial irradiation Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC was first proposed in 1973 and is recommended for patients demonstrating good response to initial therapy. The general pattern of care amongst radiation oncologists in Germany has not been previously evaluated.We conceptualized and conducted this survey to assess patterns of care. Method(s): We surveyed radiation oncology institutions in Germany via an online questionnaire sent by e-mail to member institutions of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO e.V.). The questions were based on respondent and treatment characteristics with emphasis on prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited- and extensive-stage SCLC. Result(s):We receivedatotal of95responses (29%response rate). Of which 64were completed and returned and hence eligible for evaluation. Sixty-one percent of respondents were between the ages of 50-59, 88%with over 15 years of experience in the management of lungmalignancies. Sixtysevenpercent of the institutions stage theirpatients initially with 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Of the 64 responses, 97% recommended deliveryofPCI in therapy responders with LS-SCLC compared to 67% with ES-SCLC. Interestingly, a quarter of respondents offered hippocampal-avoidance PCI with only 38% following their patients with serial brain imaging followingPCI.Neuropsychological testingwas generally not routinely performed. Conclusion(s): German radiation oncology institutions showed interesting variations in certain aspects yet in general congruence in SCLC management and PCI delivery in accordance with the updated national and international guidelines. Future randomized clinical trials will further reduce discrepancies regarding delivery of PCI especially in ES-SCLC.",Excluded

318,"Plasma membrane nanoporation as a possible mechanism behind infrared excitation of cells OBJECTIVE: Short infrared (IR) laser pulses have been used to stimulate action potentials in neurons both in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon has remained elusive. In vitro studies have found that pulsed IR exposure generates a nearly instant change in capacitance in the plasma membrane, characterized by inward rectification, a common feature in pore-forming exposures, such as electrical pulses and acoustic shock waves. Based on this similarity, we hypothesize that the mechanism of IR stimulation is the formation of short-lived nanopores in the plasma membrane. These transient, small-diameter pores allow the influx of extracellular ions that lead to action potential generation, possibly through activation of secondary messenger pathways or depolarization of the cell membrane resulting in activation of voltage-gated ion channels.APPROACH: A variety of fluorescent markers are used to observe the cell response to IR stimulation to monitor for effects indicative of nanoporation in other modalities.MAIN RESULTS: We observe rapid, transient rises in intracellular Ca(2+), influx of YO-PRO-1 and propidium iodide into the cell signifying membrane permeabilization, cellular blebbing and swelling, and activation of the intracellular phosphoinositides lipid signaling pathway.SIGNIFICANCE: This conclusion better explains the experimental observations and limitations of IR-induced neurological stimulation and represents a distinct theoretical shift in the understanding of the mechanism of IR-induced stimulation.",Excluded
98,"Establishment and characterization of a chemoresistant glioblastoma cell line from an Iraqi patient Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumour in humans, and has a very poor prognosis. As it is a well known fact that environmental factors especially radiation exposure is a major risk for glioblastoma multiforme and Iraq had been exposed in a relatively short period to 2 international wars with documented radiation exposure, so this paper might give justification for establishment of a new glioblastoma cell line. This cell line has been established from a cerebral glioblastoma multiforme in a 72-year-old Iraqi man who underwent surgery for an intracranial tumour in 2005. The morphology, growth kinetics, karyotype, immunocytochemistry and angiogenesis factor expression profile of this ANGM5 cell line were studied. The cell line has been grown continuously for more than 200 serial passages in standard culture media presenting no sign of cell senescence. The cultured cells are elongated or multipolar in shape and the population doubling time is 28 hours. The karyotype is complex and the chromosomal number varied between 46 and 48. The cell line is resistant to Temozolomide, cisplatin, vincristine and etoposide. This chemoresistance could be explained by the overexpression of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) which found to be overexpressed by this cell line. Immunocytochemistry also showed that this cell line exhibited several characteristic features of glioblastomas, analysis of glial markers demonstrated that cells are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and negative for nestin and calbindin. Protein microarray analysis showed very high production of TIMP2 as well as other factors that are important for the invasiveness and aggressiveness of glioblastoma. This glioblastoma cell line is a useful addition to the cell lines currently available for study of the pathobiology and chemoresistance properties of glioblastoma multiforme as well as for antitumour drug discovery.",Excluded
1019,"Physical and biomedical countermeasures for space radiation risk Radiation exposure represents a serious hindrance for long-term interplanetary missions because of the high uncertainty on risk coefficients, and to the lack of simple countermeasures. Even if uncertainties in risk assessment will be reduced in the next few years, there is little doubt that appropriate countermeasures have to be taken to reduce the exposure or the biological damage produced by cosmic radiation. In addition, it is necessary to provide effective countermeasures against solar particle events, which can produce acute effects, even life threatening, for inadequately protected crews. Strategies that may prove to be effective in reducing exposure, or the effects of the irradiation, include shielding, administration of drugs or dietary supplements to reduce the radiation effects, crew selection based on a screening of individual radiation sensitivity. It is foreseeable that research in passive and active radiation shielding, radioprotective chemicals, and individual susceptibility will boost in the next years to provide efficient countermeasures to the space radiation threat.",Excluded
282,"The hippocampus in aging and disease: From plasticity to vulnerability The hippocampus has a pivotal role in learning and in the formation and consolidation of memory and is critically involved in the regulation of emotion, fear, anxiety, and stress. Studies of the hippocampus have been central to the study of memory in humans and in recent years, the regional specialization and organization of hippocampal functions have been elucidated in experimental models and in human neurological and psychiatric diseases. The hippocampus has long been considered a classic model for the study of neuroplasticity as many examples of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation and -depression have been identified and demonstrated in hippocampal circuits. Neuroplasticity is the ability to adapt and reorganize the structure or function to internal or external stimuli and occurs at the cellular, population, network or behavioral level and is reflected in the cytological and network architecture as well as in intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons and circuits. The high degree of hippocampal neuroplasticity might, however, be also negatively reflected in the pronounced vulnerability of the hippocampus to deleterious conditions such as ischemia, epilepsy, chronic stress, neurodegeneration and aging targeting hippocampal structure and function and leading to cognitive deficits. Considering this framework of plasticity and vulnerability, we here review basic principles of hippocampal anatomy and neuroplasticity on various levels as well as recent findings regarding the functional organization of the hippocampus in light of the regional vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, epilepsy, neuroinflammation and aging.

The extreme radiosensitivity of the photoreceptor cells was underlined by the continued manifestation of fine structural changes and cell death up to 6 months post-radiation in animals receiving doses above 500 cGy. The retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were more radioresistant than photoreceptors and RPE cell loss was only observed at doses of more than 1500 cGy. One year after irradiation with 1500 cGy the retinal vasculature showed capillary occlusion with some evidence of recanalisation. Telangiectasia was observed in the large retinal veins. Although the inner retinal neurones and glial cells showed no evidence of direct radiation damage, the nerve fibre layer adjacent to occluded retinal vessels demonstrated ultrastructural evidence of ischaemic neuropathy and retinal oedema.

With 10,003 patients randomized at 193 sites, the PROMISE trial provides a snapshot of real-world care for this very common presentation. Over a median follow-up of 25 months, PROMISE did not find significant differences in major clinical events (composite endpoint 164 vs. 151, HR 1.04 (0.83-1.29); p = 0.75) between the two strategies. Other major findings were the large discrepancy between estimates of pre-test likelihood and observed prevalence for obstructive CAD (>=50 %) and the proportion of noninvasive tests positive for ischemia or obstructive CAD (53 vs. 11 %; respectively) and the better efficiency of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to select patients for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) who had obstructive CAD (72 vs. 48 % for coronary CTA and functional testing, respectively). Radiation exposure was higher in the CT arm compared to all functional testing but lower than for nuclear perfusion stress testing. Improvement of patient selection for diagnostic testing and risk stratification will be keys to increase efficacy and efficiency of management of patients with suspicion for stable CAD.",Excluded

901,"Toxicity profile of spine stereotactic radiosurgery among long-term survivors Purpose/Objective(s): To characterize toxicity risk profiles in long-term survivors (>4 years) after spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS). Long-term oncologic control outcomes have been previously reported. This study represents the largest series reporting long-term toxicity profiles after SSRS. Materials/Methods: From December 2002 to June 2011, 228 patients with 261 segments were treated with spine stereotactic radiosurgery for metastatic disease. A subset cohort of 53 patients with 59 segments survived a minimum of 4 years after treatment and was analyzed for radiation associated toxicity. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 were used to grade myelopathy, myelitis, radiculopathy, and fracture. Toxicity endpoints occurring in the setting of tumor progression were not attributed to treatment effect. Toxicity development was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Patients were followed clinically and radiographically for a median of 5.6 years (range 49-110 months). SSRS fractionation schemes were 24 Gy in 1 fraction (25%), 18 Gy in 1 fraction (19%), 27 Gy in 3 fractions (32%), 30 Gy in 5 fractions (11%), 16 Gy in 1 fraction (11%), or 22 Gy in 1 fraction (2%). There were 6 sites treated which received prior conventional radiation (10.2%). Three patients (5%) required additional surgery due to tumor progression while 8 (13.6%) received additional palliative radiation. Long-term treatment related toxicity events included one case of Grade 4 myelopathy resulting in hemi-cord syndrome (1.7%), which occurred 13 months after therapy. Sensory radiculopathy occurred in 5 cases (8.5%) at a median of 12.8 months (range 2.5-25.4), of which, 2 required intrathecal pain pumps for symptom management. Eight treated segments (13.6%) involving 7 patients developed vertebral body collapse and/or endplate fracture at a median 7.5 months (range 0.6-49.2) with 6 (10.2%) requiring either percutaneous vertebroplasty or surgery. Overall, in this subset cohort of long-term survivors, a toxicity event was observed in 15 cases (25%) of which 9 (15%) were at least grade 3. The majority of events (53%) were vertebral fracture. Forty percent of toxicity occurred beyond 12 months of therapy (median 10 months) with events being observed beyond 2 years (radiculopathy) and even 4 years (vertebral fracture) later. Combined grade 3+ neurological toxicity occurred in 5.6% of long-term survivors at a median of 12.7 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Spine stereotactic radiosurgery appears to have a favorable late toxicity profile even amongst a selected cohort of long-term survivors. The overwhelming majority of events occur within 2 years of treatment. Very late toxicity beyond 4 years occurred in 1/59 treated sites and consisted of a vertebral body fracture. There were no very late neurological toxicities beyond 4 years. Overall, these data support the durable safety of the technique.",Excluded
878,"SCH 23390 in the prefrontal cortex enhances the effect of apomorphine on prepulse inhibition of rats The aim of this study was to investigate the role of dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex in the regulation of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle. Rats were instrumented with permanent indwelling cannulas into the prefrontal cortex region and tested at least one week after surgery using a randomized sequence, repeated-measures protocol. Doses of apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously, s.c.) and MK-801 (0.03 mg/kg s.c.) were obtained from preliminary dose-response studies. Intracerebral injection of 0.5 microg/side of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, significantly enhanced the disruptive effect of apomorphine on PPI, but had no effect on its own or on startle amplitude or habituation. Furthermore, the effect of SCH 23390 on PPI was not seen with a lower dose (0.2 microg/side) or in combination with the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. These data confirm and extend previous reports on the importance of dopaminergic innervation of the prefrontal cortex in the regulation of PPI. It is suggested that apomorphine treatment directly or indirectly activates dopamine D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex to inhibit its own action on PPI elsewhere in the brain, presumably in the nucleus accumbens. Antagonism of this inhibitory component by SCH 23390 therefore leads to a larger disruption of PPI.",Excluded
161,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an inexorably progressive motoneuron disease, is accompanied by significantly increased markers of inflammation. These inflammatory constituents could protect, harm, do neither, or do both. Objective(s): Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed in patients with sporadic ALS to suppress neuroinflammation and improve clinical outcomes after CNS engraftment. Method(s): Six patients with definite ALS received total body irradiation followed by peripheral blood HSCT infusion from human leukocyte antigen identically matched sibling donors. Disease progression and survival were assessed monthly and compared with matched historic database patients. Autopsy samples from brain and spinal cord were examined immunohistochemically and by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Donor-derived DNA in brain and spinal cord tissue was evaluated for the extent of chimerism. Result(s): No clinical benefits were evident. Four patients were 100% engrafted; postmortem tissue examination in two of the 100% engrafted patients demonstrated 16% to 38% donor-derived DNA at sites with motoneuron pathology, which may correspond to the observed increased CD68 or CD1a-positive cells. Neither donor DNA nor increased cell numbers were found in several unaffected brain regions. A third minimally engrafted patient had neither donor DNA nor increased infiltrating cells in the CNS. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that peripheral cells derived from donor hematopoietic stem cells can enter the human CNS primarily at sites of motoneuron pathology and engraft as immunomodulatory cells. Although unmodified hematopoietic stem cells did not benefit these sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, such cells may provide a cellular vehicle for future CNS gene therapy. © 2008 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.",Excluded

363,"Light-evoked disc shedding by rod photoreceptors in vitro: relationship to medium bicarbonate concentration Although studies on the control of photoperiod-related shedding by rod photoreceptors in frogs suggested that the mechanisms which initiate shedding are intrinsic features of the eye, attempts to observe light-evoked shedding in opened eye cups in balanced salt solutions have been unsuccessful. We have examined disc shedding in eye cups kept in a complex tissue culture medium. Eye cups were prepared in red light from dark-adapted animals or in white light from constant light-treated animals. Light-evoked shedding did not occur in the standard medium with -20 mM sodium bicarbonate, but a large light-evoked response was consistently seen when medium bicarbonate was raised to 030 mM. In high-bicarbonate medium, light-evoked shedding was comparable in magnitude, size distribution of phagosomes, and time course to similar responses observed in intact animals. Preliminary analysis of culture conditions which support shedding suggests that bicarbonate ion concentration is of critical importance. However, lack of light-evoked shedding in a high-bicarbonate Ringer solution suggests that some additional unidentified factor(s) in the complex medium is also necessary. The data indicate that both light- and dark-dependent processes involved in the control of photoperiod-related shedding are sustained in appropriate culture medium.",Excluded

477,"Single fraction prophylactic cranial irradiation for small cell carcinoma of the lung The effectiveness of a single 8-Gy fraction prophylactic cranial irradiation regime was assessed in 106 patients with small-cell carcinoma of the lung. All patients had limited stage disease and received combination chemotherapy consisting of either cisplatin or carboplatin with ifosfamide, etoposide, and vincristine (VICE). Cranial irradiation was administered 48 h after the first cycle of chemotherapy and was well tolerated. Actual 2-year survival was 35% and cranial relapse occurred in 22% of those patients who achieved complete remission. This compares favourably with a cranial relapse rate of 45% incomplete remitters previously reported with the same chemotherapy regime after a minimum follow-up of 2 years where PCI was not used. Formal psychometric testing was performed retrospectively on a series of 25 long-term survivors of whom 14 were taken from this reported series. Whilst 75% of patients were impaired on at least one test with 68% performing badly in the most complex task, this was not associated with clinically detectable neurological damage and the patients did not complain of memory or concentration difficulties. In conclusion, single fraction PCI, when used with platinum based combination chemotherapy, appears to be equally effective but may be less neurotoxic than the more standard fractionated regimes.",Excluded

1336,"Utility of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Modern Era with Magnetic Resonance Imaging Surveillance Aims: To retrospectively analyse the impact of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) on survival and intracranial progression in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) in the modern era of widespread magnetic resonance imaging brain screening. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with LS-SCLC treated within our network between 2009 and 2020 who responded to initial therapy were stratified by receipt of PCI and stage of disease. A propensity score match analysis was carried out for stage II-III patients. Overall and neurological survival were defined as time to death and presumed death due to uncontrolled intracranial disease, respectively. Brain metastasis-free survival and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival were defined as freedom from intracranial progression and symptomatic intracranial progression, respectively. The effect of PCI on these outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Result(s): In total, 243 (69.6%) of 349 patients received PCI. On multivariate analysis in the propensity matched stage II-III cohort, PCI was a significant predictor of improved neurological survival (hazard ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.65; P = 0.01), brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.51; P < 0.01) and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.55; P < 0.01), but not improved overall survival. Two-year neurological survival estimates within the propensity matched cohort were 96.8% (95% confidence interval 87.6-99.2%) with PCI and 77.2% (95% confidence interval 63.0-86.4%) without PCI and 1- and 2-year estimates of incidence of brain metastases were 3.9% (95% confidence interval 1.3-11.7%) and 11.7% (95% confidence interval 5.6-23.5%) in the PCI group and 31.6% (95% confidence interval 22.1-43.9%) and 40.4% (95% confidence interval 29.2-54.0%) in the no PCI group, respectively. Conclusion(s): In the modern era of magnetic resonance imaging screening, PCI was associated with reduced incidence of intracranial progression in patients with stage II-III LS-SCLC who respond to initial therapy. This, importantly, translated to a decreased risk of neurological death within our propensity matched cohort, without significant improvement in overall survival.

1144,"Decrease in synaptic transmission can reverse the propagation direction of epileptiform activity in hippocampus in vivo Most types of epileptiform activity with synaptic transmission have been shown to propagate from the CA3 to CA1 region in hippocampus. However, nonsynaptic epileptiform activity induced in vitro is known to propagate slowly from the caudal end of CA1 toward CA2/CA3. Understanding the propagation modes of epileptiform activity, and their causality is important to revealing the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy and developing new treatments. In this paper, the effect of the synaptic transmission suppression on the propagation of epilepsy in vivo was investigated by using multiple-channel recording probes in CA1. Nonsynaptic epileptiform activity was induced by calcium chelator EGTA with varied concentrations of potassium. For comparison, disinhibition synaptic epileptiform activity was induced by picrotoxin (PTX) with or without partial suppression of excitatory synaptic transmission. The propagation velocity was calculated by measuring the time delay between two electrodes separated by a known distance. The results show that in vivo nonsynaptic epileptiform activity propagates with a direction and velocity comparable to those observed in in vitro preparations. The direction of propagation for nonsynaptic activity is reversed from the PTX-induced synaptic activity. A reversal in propagation direction and change in velocity were also observed dynamically during the process of synaptic transmission suppression. Even a partial suppression of synaptic transmission was sufficient to significantly change the propagation direction and velocity of epileptiform activity. These results suggest the possibility that the measurement of propagation can provide important information about the synaptic mechanism underlying epileptic activity.",Excluded

For each patient, identical CT sets with structures were used for both CO-VMAT and NC-VMAT planning. For CO-VMAT, one full arc and two coplanar half arcs were used. For NC-VMAT, one full coplanar and two non-coplanar half arcs with couch rotation of 315degree or 45degree were used. Dose constraints were adhered to the RTOG 0614, RTOG 0933 and TMH protocol. Dose volumetric parameters were collected for statistical analysis.Results: .NC-VMAT achieved significant dose reduction in contralateral hippocampus, both temporal lobes and cochleae, and other OARs while the plan qualities remained the same. In particular, NC-VMAT decreased contralateral hippocampus mean dose by 1.67Gy. Similarly, the NC-VMAT decreased temporal lobe mean dose by 6.29Gy and 2.8Gy for ipsilateral and contralateral side respectively. Furthermore, it decreased cochlea mean dose by 5.34Gy and 0.97Gy for ipsilateral and contralateral side respectively.

255,"The effects of a spaceflight analog with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on sensorimotor adaptation Aboard the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts must adapt to altered vestibular and somatosensory inputs due to microgravity. Sensorimotor adaptation on Earth is often studied with a task that introduces visuomotor conflict. Retention of the adaptation process, known as savings, can be measured when subjects are exposed to the same adaptive task multiple times. It is unclear how adaptation demands found on the ISS might interfere with the ability to adapt to other sensory conflict at the same time. In the present study, we investigated the impact of 30 days' head-down tilt bed rest combined with elevated carbon dioxide (HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>) as a spaceflight analog on sensorimotor adaptation. Eleven subjects used a joystick to move a cursor to targets presented on a computer screen under veridical cursor feedback and 45degree rotated feedback. During this NASA campaign, five individuals presented with optic disk edema, a sign of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). Thus, we also performed post hoc exploratory analyses between subgroups who did and did not show signs of SANS. HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> had some impact on sensorimotor adaptation, with a lack of savings across the whole group. SANS individuals showed larger, more persistent after-effects, suggesting a shift from relying on cognitive to more implicit processing of adaptive behaviors. Overall, these findings suggest that HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> alters the way in which individuals engage in sensorimotor processing. These findings have important implications for missions and mission training, which require individuals to adapt to altered sensory inputs over long periods in space. <b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This is the first bed rest campaign examining sensorimotor adaptation and savings in response to the combined effect of HDBR + CO2 and to observe signs of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) in HDBR participants.

Individuals who developed signs of SANS seem to rely more on implicit rather than cognitive processing of adaptive behaviors than subjects who did not present signs of SANS.",Excluded
933,"Cutaneous metastases from neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix-An unusual metastatic lesion from an uncommon malignancy Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is an uncommon and aggressive type of small cell cervical cancer. NECs mostly arise from gastro-entero-pancreatic tract and the lung, but rarely from other organs like cervix. NEC of the cervix is a rare malignancy and constitutes 0.9%-1.5% of cervical tumors. NECs of cervix are common in perimenopausal females and present with abnormal vaginal bleeding and mimic squamous cell cancers, usually with no distinguishing features. On Immunohistochemistry, presence of chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD-56 is necessary to make a diagnosis of small cell carcinoma. These tumors are notorious for local as well as distant relapses in comparison to their squamous and adenocarcinoma counterpart. NECs are characterized by highly aggressive clinical behavior and carry a poor prognosis. They commonly metastases to lung, liver, brain, and bones even in early stages of the disease. Metastasis to skin is a rare occurrence. We herein report a case of a NEC of the uterine cervix with multiple cutaneous metastases. After the initial diagnosis of NEC of cervix, the patient received concurrent chemoradiation followed by intracavitary brachytherapy. On subsequent follow-up, the patient developed multiple cutaneous metastasis along with liver metastases. This case is reported in view of rarity of the case with skin metastases. To the best of our knowledge, only 3 cases of cutaneous metastases from NEC of the cervix are reported till date.

We retrospectively reviewed 124 patients treated with Gamma Knife SRS from January 2018 to December 2019 at our institution using a mask-based immobilization system. Patient and treatment characteristics were collected and summarized as well as interfraction shifts and treatment-related outcomes. This dataset includes 124 patients with an associated 358 intracranial tumors. Twenty-four patients presented with primary brain tumors, which included 14 meningiomas and 10 other histologies, with 100 patients having brain metastases. Sixty tumors were post-operative, while 298 were intact. The median dose for primary tumors was 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median doses to metastases were 20 Gy in 1 fraction, 27 Gy in 3 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median interfraction CBCT shifts were submillimeter.

379,"[Rotational digital subtraction angiography of carotid bifurcation stenosis] PURPOSE: A prospective study was designed to evaluate, whether multiplanar imaging with rotational digital subtraction angiography (R-DSA) could improve assessment of carotid artery bifurcation stenosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 45 patients with suspected stenosis of the ICA were examined with DSA in standard projections (0 degree-(45 degrees)-90 degrees) and additional R-DSA of each ICA from 0-90 degrees in 10 degrees steps. We compared imaging quality and degree of stenosis as well as exposure of the patients to radiation and contrast media.RESULTS: 79/82 R-DSA (96%) were suitable for evaluation of stenosis, 58/82 (70%) matched the quality standard of single projection DSA. Specificity and sensitivity of the R-DSA to diagnose high grade ACI stenosis were 100% and 94%, respectively. 7/79 R-DSA revealed a higher and 3/79 a lower degree of stenosis than the corresponding DSA. Regarding the degree of stenosis there was no significant difference between the two modalities (p > 0.05), but R-DSA detected 4 stenoses greater than 60% that were estimated to be lower than 60% by DSA. Radiation dose for R-DSA was equivalent to one DSA run (170 cGycm2). The average amount of contrast media (25 ml) was slightly higher than for 2-3 single-projection DSA (19.8 ml).CONCLUSIONS: R-DSA provides high quality imaging of the carotid bifurcation with multiplanar projections facilitating exact grading of vessel stenosis. The number of cases (n = 2) is to small to judge the value of R-DSA as to (tandem-) stenosis of the distal ICA. Still, diagnostic value and low radiation exposure justify the use of R-DSA as additional series to standard protocols.",Excluded
908,"Selectivity of canary HVC neurons for the bird's own song: modulation by photoperiodic conditions To what extent seasonal factors modify the neuronal functional properties within the nuclei of the avian song system remains an open question. In adult songbirds, neurons of the song premotor nucleus HVC (used as a proper name) exhibit selective responses for the bird's own song (BOS). Here we examine whether, outside the breeding season, when songs are less stereotyped, HVC neurons of male canaries still respond selectively to the BOS produced during this period. In an initial experiment, single-unit recordings (n = 114) revealed that the neuronal selectivity for the current BOS was attenuated in males exposed to a short-day photoperiod (typical of the nonbreeding season) compared with that found in males exposed to a long-day photoperiod. In long-day conditions, 35% of the cells responded to the BOS, whereas only 12% did in short-day conditions; there were four times more selective cells (d' > 1) in long-day than in short-day conditions. To determine whether these effects were the consequence of differences in acoustic features between breeding and nonbreeding songs, neurons (n = 72) recorded in short-day conditions were tested with both a short-day BOS and a long-day BOS. A low percentage of neurons exhibited responses to short-day or to long-day BOS (11% for each song). Responses of putative interneurons (spike duration < 0.4 ms) and of putative relay cells were similarly attenuated by the short-day conditions. These results strongly suggest that, in canary, rather than being a fixed property, the selectivity for the BOS moves along a continuum and peaks when the day length mimics the breeding conditions.",Excluded
522,"A novel high-resolution in vivo imaging technique to study the dynamic response of intracranial structures to tumor growth and therapeutics We have successfully integrated previously established Intracranial window (ICW) technology (1-4) with intravital 2-photon confocal microscopy to develop a novel platform that allows for direct long-term visualization of tissue structure changes intracranially. Imaging at a single cell resolution in a real-time fashion provides supplementary dynamic information beyond that provided by standard end-point histological analysis, which looks solely at 'snap-shot' cross sections of tissue. Establishing this intravital imaging technique in fluorescent chimeric mice, we are able to image four fluorescent channels simultaneously. By incorporating fluorescently labeled cells, such as GFP+ bone marrow, it is possible to track the fate of these cells studying their long-term migration, integration and differentiation within tissue. Further integration of a secondary reporter cell, such as an mCherry glioma tumor line, allows for characterization of cell:cell interactions. Structural changes in the tissue microenvironment can be highlighted through the addition of intra-vital dyes and antibodies, for example CD31 tagged antibodies and Dextran molecules. Moreover, we describe the combination of our ICW imaging model with a small animal micro-irradiator that provides stereotactic irradiation, creating a platform through which the dynamic tissue changes that occur following the administration of ionizing irradiation can be assessed. Current limitations of our model include penetrance of the microscope, which is limited to a depth of up to 900 mum from the sub cortical surface, limiting imaging to the dorsal axis of the brain. The presence of the skull bone makes the ICW a more challenging technical procedure, compared to the more established and utilized chamber models currently used to study mammary tissue and fat pads (5-7). In addition, the ICW provides many challenges when optimizing the imaging.",Excluded
414,"Accelerator-based epithermal neutron sources for boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors This paper reviews the development of low-energy light ion accelerator-based neutron sources (ABNSs) for the treatment of brain tumors through an intact scalp and skull using boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). A major advantage of an ABNS for BNCT over reactor-based neutron sources is the potential for siting within a hospital. Consequently, light-ion accelerators that are injectors to larger machines in high-energy physics facilities are not considered. An ABNS for BNCT is composed of: (1) the accelerator hardware for producing a high current charged particle beam, (2) an appropriate neutron-producing target and target heat removal system (HRS), and (3) a moderator/reflector assembly to render the flux energy spectrum of neutrons produced in the target suitable for patient irradiation. As a consequence of the efforts of researchers throughout the world, progress has been made on the design, manufacture, and testing of these three major components. Although an ABNS facility has not yet been built that has optimally assembled these three components, the feasibility of clinically useful ABNSs has been clearly established. Both electrostatic and radio frequency linear accelerators of reasonable cost (approximately 1.5 M dollars) appear to be capable of producing charged particle beams, with combinations of accelerated particle energy (a few MeV) and beam currents (approximately 10 mA) that are suitable for a hospital-based ABNS for BNCT. The specific accelerator performance requirements depend upon the charged particle reaction by which neutrons are produced in the target and the clinical requirements for neutron field quality and intensity. The accelerator performance requirements are more demanding for beryllium than for lithium as a target. However, beryllium targets are more easily cooled. The accelerator performance requirements are also more demanding for greater neutron field quality and intensity. Target HRSs that are based on submerged-jet impingement and the use of microchannels have emerged as viable target cooling options. Neutron fields for reactor-based neutron sources provide an obvious basis of comparison for ABNS field quality. This paper compares Monte Carlo calculations of neutron field quality for an ABNS and an idealized standard reactor neutron field (ISRNF). The comparison shows that with lithium as a target, an ABNS can create a neutron field with a field quality that is significantly better (by a factor of approximately 1.2, as judged by the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-dose that can be delivered to a tumor at a depth of 6cm) than that for the ISRNF. Also, for a beam current of 10 mA, the treatment time is calculated to be reasonable (approximately 30 min) for the boron concentrations that have been assumed. [References: 46]",Excluded

Recently, these proteins have been described to be expressed in neuroectodermal tumors and to function as cancer-retina antigens. Here, we show that light can down-regulate gene expression of rhodopsin, transducin, and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) and up-regulate guanylyl cyclase 1, recoverin, and arrestin in human melanoma cells in vitro, comparable to physiologic changes earlier observed in photoreceptor cells. Similar modulation can be detected at the protein level in melanoma cells except for no changes in PDE6 protein levels. Two regulatory pathways have been identified: Sp1/Sp3/Sp4 proteins for rhodopsin and PDE6, and mitogen-activated protein kinases for recoverin and arrestin. The visual cascade and retinoic acid as its derivate do not play any role in this process.

By contrast, non-mammalian vertebrates possess many extraocular photoreceptors but in many cases the role of these photoreceptors and their underlying photopigments is unknown. In birds, deep brain photoreceptors have been shown to sense photic changes in daylength (photoperiod) and mediate seasonal reproduction. Nonetheless, the specific identity of the opsin photopigment 'sensor' involved has remained elusive. Previously, we showed that vertebrate ancient (VA) opsin is expressed in avian hypothalamic neurons and forms a photosensitive molecule. However, a direct functional link between VA opsin and the regulation of seasonal biology was absent. Here, we report the in vivo and in vitro absorption spectra (lambda<inf>max</inf>=~490 nm) for chicken VA photopigments. Furthermore, the spectral sensitivity of these photopigments match the peak absorbance of the avian photoperiodic response (lambda<inf>max</inf>=492 nm) and permits maximum photon capture within the restricted light environment of the hypothalamus. Such a correspondence argues strongly that VA opsin plays a key role in regulating seasonal reproduction in birds. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Excluded

116,Surface recording of orthodromic sensory nerve action potentials in median and ulnar nerves in normal subjects Reference values of sensory nerve compound action potentials (CAP) were established in 50 healthy subjects by examination with surface electrodes placed in a transverse and a longitudinal position at the wrist. Longitudinal electrodes record potentials of larger amplitude and shorter duration than transversally recorded CAPs. Both amplitude and duration were increased by an increase of interelectrode distance. The use of amplitude and duration as variables is encouraged by the well-defined biologic variation obtained when fixed interelectrode distance is used and when values are corrected for age and temperature. The strong correlation between amplitude and duration might indicate that the decrease of amplitude with age is caused by the reduction of conduction velocity rather than axonal loss. The ulnar nerve CAPs differ from those of the median nerve mostly with regard to influence of age and temperature. The reasons for this are discussed.,Excluded
236,"Superoxyde dismutase effect on irradiated central nervous system. About experimental pilote studies with rats. [French] It has been observed that bovine superoxide dismutase (SOD) can reduce some chronic complications due to radiotherapy. For this reason this enzyme has been used in the rat to treat radiation induced encaphalitis, studied by the two-way avoidance test. SOD has allowed significant regression of troubles in two studies with chronic encephalitis and two studies with acute encephalitis. Moreover, another study has shown that SOD prevented cognitival troubles brought on by strong painful stimulus. Thus SOD has been shown able to improve cerebral performances after a specific aggression (after radiotherapy) or after a non specific one (after very painful stimulus). This observation leads to interesting prospects for therapy.",Excluded
1187,"Lower doses to hippocampi and other brain structures for skull-base meningiomas with intensity modulated proton therapy compared to photon therapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiotherapy of skull-base meningiomas is challenging due to the close proximity of multiple sensitive organs at risk (OARs). This study systematically compared intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), non-coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) based on automated treatment planning. Differences in OARs sparing, with specific focus on the hippocampi, and low-dose delivery were quantified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients, target diameter >3cm, were included. Automated plan generation was used to calculate a VMAT plan with three non-coplanar arcs, an IMRT plan with nine non-coplanar beams with optimized gantry and couch angles, and an IMPT plan with three patient-specific selected non-coplanar beams. A prescription dose of 50.4 GyRBE in 28 fractions was used. The same set of constraints and prioritized objectives was used. All plans were rescaled to the same target coverage. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in OAR dose parameters between planning techniques.RESULTS: Compared to VMAT and IMRT, IMPT significantly improved dose conformity to the target volume. Consequently, large dose reductions in OARs were observed. With respect to VMAT, the mean dose and D<sub>40%</sub> in the bilateral hippocampus were on average reduced by 48% and 74%, respectively (p<=0.005). With IMPT, the mean dose in the normal brain and volumes receiving 20-30Gy were up to 47% lower (p<=0.01). When comparing IMPT and IMRT, even larger dose differences in those OARs were observed.CONCLUSION: For skull-base meningiomas IMPT allows for a considerable dose reduction in the hippocampi, normal brain and other OARs compared to both non-coplanar VMAT and IMRT, which may lead to a clinically relevant reduction of late neurocognitive side effects.",Excluded

107,"The use of gallium-68 labeled somatostatin receptors in PET/CT imaging 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs PET/CT has become the most promising noninvasive procedure to study well-differentiated NET. Although the excellent diagnostic accuracy of the procedure is well known, its use is limited to specialized centers in Europe as parts of clinical trials. Literature reports confirm the superiority of 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs PET/CT for the assessment of well-differentiated NET over morphologic imaging procedures, SRS, and even PET/CT using metabolic radiotracers. 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs provide good visualization of NET lesions at both the primary and the metastatic sites (node, bone, liver, and unusual localizations). The advantages of their use over metabolic tracers (18F-DOPA, 18F-FDG) are not only limited to a better overall detection rate but also to the fact that they also provide data on SSTR expression on target lesions, resulting a fundamental procedure before starting therapy with either hot or cold somatostatin analogues. Moreover, they can be used also in centers without an on-site cyclotron. To interpret 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs images correctly, it is crucial to understand the tracer's biodistribution as well as the conditions that may alter tracer uptake. Considering that SSTR are expressed on activated lymphocytes, all areas of inflammation show 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs uptake. Areas of increased uptake in frequent sites of inflammation (eg, thyroid, mediastinal nodes, inguinal nodes, and nodes adjacent to areas of recent surgery/trauma) should be interpreted with care. A detailed clinical history with particular attention to concomitant disorders (eg, sarcoidosis, chronic gastritis, chronic thryoiditis) and recent invasive procedures or trauma may often help image interpretation. The presence of uptake in the head of the pancreas should always be carefully evaluated because it may often be benign. Otherwise, because the pancreas is also a frequent site of NET onset, particular attention should be devoted to the evaluation of the uptake pattern (diffuse more likely to be benign) and to the comparison with other imaging techniques. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

106,"Multimodality management of borderline resectable pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: Sentinel report of a single-institutional experience Background: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) constitute about 3% of pancreatic neoplasms. In borderline resectable disease, there is a lack of data to support an optimal neoadjuvant approach for curative outcomes. We describe our institutional experience with a multimodality approach. Method(s): We identified all patients with borderline resectable PNET, using NCCN criteria for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, who received neoadjuvant therapy at our institution between 2000 and 2013. The reason for borderline status was noted. Neoadjuvant regimen, radiographic response, pathologic response, surgical margins, nodal harvest, number of positive nodes, and recurrence were all documented. Result(s): A total of 112 patients had undergone pancreatic resections for neuroendocrine tumors during the study period. Six patients had borderline resectable disease. The mean age was 55 years (24-70). They all received at least 1 cycle of Temodar and Xeloda. Three of the six patients also received concurrent 5-FU and radiation. There was radiographic evidence of treatment response in all patients. Five of six patients (83 %) had negative margin (R0) resection. Low volume miliary metastatic disease in the liver was detected in 1 patient at the time of surgery. The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 12. Half of the patients had node positive disease. On pathologic review, 4 patients had histologic evidence of a moderate response. All patients are alive and 5/6 are free of disease. Range of follow up is 3.0-4.32 years. The patient with metastatic disease has had no progression and is the only one who is currently receiving any form of treatment. Conclusion(s): Neoadjuvant Temodar and Xeloda +/- radiation with 5-FU sensitization can lead to R0 resection with durable response in patients with borderline resectable PNET. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of multimodality therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/- chemoradiation and surgery) in the treatment of borderline resectable PNET.",Excluded
727,"Approaches to sensitizing glioblastoma to radiotherapy: Use of lentiviral vectors Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumour and extirpation followed by radio- and chemotherapy has had minimal impact on the median survival of patients which is still less than one year. Hence, a novel therapeutic modality is required if the survival of patients with this disease is to be improved. ATM, mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), plays a central role in the response to DNA double strand breaks and patients with this disorder are characterised by extreme sensitivity to radiation, increased risk of cancer and neurodegeneration. Thus, ATM represents a potential target for radiosensitization of brain tumour cells. A safe, non-replicating lentivirus is used to abrogate ATM in GBM through the antisense and RNAi approaches for radiosensitization. With either techniques, ATM protein was reduced by >90% and there was a 3-fold sensitization of GBM cells to radiation. ATM protein activation as well as ATM pS1981 foci formation were defective and downstream signalling determined by Ser15 phosphorylation on p53 was reduced. Success in the approaches provides a novel and exciting strategy for the treatment of GBM and thus improving the survival of patients with these tumours.",Excluded

The response rates, duration of response, and toxicities are compared with those of other series of patients treated with 32P and with sequential hemibody irradiation. The response rates and duration of response are similar with both modalities ranging from 58 to 95% with a duration of 3.3 to 6 months with 32P and from 75 to 86% with a median duration of 5.5 months with hemibody irradiation. There are significant differences in the patterns of response and in the toxicities of the two treatment methods. Both methods cause significant bone marrow depression. Acute radiation syndrome, radiation pneumonitis, and alopecia are seen with sequential hemibody irradiation and not with 32P, but their incidence can be reduced by careful treatment planning. Hemibody irradiation can provide pain relief within 24 to 48 h, while 32P may produce an initial exacerbation of pain. Lower hemibody irradiation alone is less toxic than either upper hemibody irradiation or 32P treatment.",Excluded

50,"Clinical outcomes of melanoma brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiation and anti-PD-1 therapy BACKGROUND: The anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy nivolumab has significant clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma. However, little is known about the safety and outcomes in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy and stereotactic radiation for the treatment of brain metastases (BMs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed retrospectively from two prospective nivolumab protocols enrolling 160 patients with advanced resected and unresectable melanoma at a single institution. Patients were included if BMs were diagnosed and treated with stereotactic radiation within 6 months of receiving nivolumab. The primary end point of this study was neurotoxicity; secondary end points included BM control and survival.RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with a total of 73 BMs treated over 30 sessions were identified. Radiation was administered before, during and after nivolumab in 33 lesions (45%), 5 lesions (7%), and 35 lesions (48%), respectively. All BMs were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in a single session except 12 BMs treated with fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy, nine of which were in the postoperative setting. One patient experienced grade 2 headaches following SRS with symptomatic relief with steroid treatment. No other treatment-related neurologic toxicities or scalp reactions were reported. Eight (11%) local BM failures with a >=20% increase in volume were noted. Of these lesions, hemorrhage was noted in 4, and edema was noted in 7. Kaplan-Meier estimates for local BM control following radiation at 6 and 12 months were 91% and 85%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) from the date of stereotactic radiation and nivolumab initiation was 11.8 and 12.0 months, respectively, in patients receiving nivolumab for unresected disease (median OS was not reached in patients treated in the resected setting).CONCLUSIONS: In our series, stereotactic radiation to melanoma BMs is well tolerated in patients who received nivolumab. BM control and OS appear prolonged compared with standard current treatment. Prospective evaluation is warranted.",Excluded
940,"Ocular torsion in upright and tilted positions during hypo- and hypergravity of parabolic flight Four subjects considered resistant to motion sickness were tested in KC-135 parabolic flight to examine ocular torsion at hypo- and hypergravity.

At 1.8 G in the tilted positions they showed greater ocular counterrolling than at 1 G. None of these three subjects became motion sick. The fourth subject showed eye torsion toward his left in all positions at zero G. This leftward bias could also be seen at 1.8 G when tilted left ear down, the side that induces rightward counterrolling. There he had less eye torsion than at 1 G. This subject became motion sick.

677,"Monte Carlo calculated output factors of a Leksell Gamma Knife unit The Leksell Gamma Knife is a standard radiosurgical tool for treating brain lesions by directing beams of gamma radiation to a specific region. The diameter of the gamma beams is confined by collimator systems and available collimator sizes are 4, 8, 14 and 18 mm. The reduction in dose rate for each collimator helmet is called the output factor (OPF). Experimental determination of OPFs is difficult due to the extremely narrow beams for which the dose is determined. In the present work, the PRESTA version of the EGS4 Monte Carlo code was used to obtain relative OPFs for the Leksell Gamma Knife for collimator sizes of 14, 8 and 4 mm (relative to that of the 18 mm collimator). A spherical probe with a radius of 1 mm was utilized in this computer experiment. Our Monte Carlo results gave OPFs of 0.974, 0.951 and 0.872 for the 14 mm, 8 mm and 4 mm collimators respectively, relative to the 18 mm collimator. Our calculated OPF for the 4mm collimator helmet was more than 8% higher than the value currently used, but in good agreement with the average of experimental values obtained by various Gamma Knife centres throughout the world and with the value now recommended by the manufacturer, Elekta (Elekta Instrument AB, Skeppargatan 8, S-114 52 Stockholm, Sweden).",Excluded

The precision of the localization procedure was assessed for several standard MRI sequences and implant orientations in phantom experiments and compared to common clinical localization procedures.MAIN RESULTS: A localization precision of 0.41 +/- 0.20 mm could be achieved for both electrode diameters compared to 1.46 +/- 0.69 mm that was achieved for 4 mm standard electrode contacts localized using a common clinical standard method. The new reference structures are intrinsically bio-compatible, and they can be detected with currently available feature detection software so that a clinical implementation of this technology should be feasible.SIGNIFICANCE: Neuropathologies are increasingly diagnosed and treated with subdural electrodes, where the exact localization of the electrode contacts with respect to the patient's cortical anatomy is a prerequisite for the procedure. Post-implantation electrode localization using MRI may be advantageous compared to the common alternative of CT-MRI image co-registration, as it avoids systematic localization errors associated with the co-registration itself, as well as brain shift and implant movement. Additionally, MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast for the identification of brain lesions without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. Recent studies show that smaller electrodes and high-density electrode grids are ideal for clinical and research purposes, but the localization of these devices in MRI has not been demonstrated.",Excluded

482,"Radiosurgery of the rat hippocampus: magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological, histological, and behavioral studies OBJECTIVE: To explore the histological, electrophysiological, radiological, and behavioral effects of radiosurgery using a new model of proton beam radiosurgery (PBR) of the rodent hippocampus.METHODS: Forty-one rats underwent PBR of the right hippocampus with nominal doses of 5 to 130 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE). Three control animals were untreated. Three months after PBR, 41 animals were evaluated with the Morris water maze, 23 with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and 22 with intrahippocampal microelectrode recordings. Animals that were studied physiologically were killed, and their brains were examined with Nissl staining and immunocytochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase, heat shock protein 72 (HSP-72), parvalbumin, calmodulin, calretinin, calbindin, and somatostatin.RESULTS: Ninety and 130 CGE resulted in decreased performance in the Morris water maze, increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diminished granule cell field potentials, and tissue necrosis, which was restricted to the irradiated side. These doses also resulted in ipsilateral up-regulation of calbindin and HSP-72. Parvalbumin was down-regulated at 130 CGE. The 30 and 60 CGE animals displayed a marked increase in HSP-72 staining on the irradiated side but no demonstrable cell loss. No asymmetries were noted in somatostatin, calretinin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase staining. Normal physiology was found in rats receiving up to 60 CGE.CONCLUSION: This study expands our understanding of the effects of radiosurgery on the mammalian brain. Three months after PBR, the irradiated rat hippocampus demonstrates necrosis at 90 CGE, but not at 60 CGE, with associated abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging, physiology, and memory testing.

211,"Magnetic fields alter electrical properties of solutions and their physiological effects Calcium chloride and snail physiological salt solutions were exposed to static magnetic fields (2.3-350 mT), and the physical properties of the solutions as well as their biologic effects were studied. Our preliminary observations show that these fields alter physicochemical properties of CaCl2 solutions and the functional effects of physiological solutions. Experiments on CaCl2 solutions demonstrated field-dependent changes of electrical conductivity, with the magnitude and the direction of conductivity change being a function of both concentration and field intensity. The changes in conductivity were maintained for periods in excess of 1 h after exposure. Conductivity changes were not found after exposure of physiological solutions to static magnetic fields, but changes of biological consequence did occur. Other experiments showed that there were several changes in cellular function observed in ganglia and isolated neurons of Helix pomatia when the perfusing medium was changed from the normal physiologic solution to the same solution after exposure to magnetic fields. These changes include membrane depolarization and increased action potential discharge, reduced uptake of Ca into cells, altered content of cyclic nucleotides in ganglia, and increased volume of isolated cell bodies. A change in hydration of calcium ions may be one of the consequences of magnetic-field exposure, and in physiological solutions this change may have functional consequences.",Excluded

125,"Prevalence, predictors, and characteristics of off-treatment fatigue in breast cancer survivors BACKGROUND: Lack of consensus regarding how to identify cancer patients with significant fatigue has hampered research regarding cancer-related fatigue (CRF).METHODS: Specific criteria were used to identify CRF cases in women with stage 0-II breast cancer (BC group, n = 304). Women completed assessments before adjuvant therapy (baseline), end of adjuvant therapy (Post-Tx), and 6 and 42 months after end of adjuvant therapy (6 and 42 Month Post-Tx). At each, women completed a clinical interview and questionnaires assessing physical and mental health. A healthy control (HC) group with no history of BC (n = 337) completed 2 similar assessments 36 months apart.RESULTS: Off-treatment CRF prevalence was 9% and 13% at the 6 and 42 Month Post-Tx assessments, respectively. Thus, 15% of the sample evidenced off-treatment CRF with 7% evidencing delayed onset CRF. CRF at the 6 Month Post-Tx assessment was associated only with CRF at baseline (OR = 3.2) and Post-Tx assessments (OR = 3.9). CRF at the 42 Month Post-Tx assessment was associated with CRF at the Post-Tx assessment (OR = 6.1), obesity at baseline, and several baseline measures of coping in response to fatigue. Off-treatment CRF cases differed markedly from CRF noncases and healthy controls on a spectrum of health status indices (mean effect size >1.0 SD).CONCLUSIONS: Results document the prevalence of off-treatment and delayed onset CRF, suggest the utility of a cognitive-behavioral model of CRF, and support NCCN guidelines recommending monitoring fatigue across the cancer trajectory.",Excluded

252,"Resistance exercise prevents plantar flexor deconditioning during bed rest Because resistance exercise (REX) and unloading induce opposing neuromuscular adaptations, we tested the efficacy of REX against the effects of 14 d of bed rest unloading (BRU) on the plantar flexor muscle group. Sixteen men were randomly assigned to no exercise (NOE, N = 8) or REX (N = 8). REX performed 5 sets x 6-10 repetitions to failure of constant resistance concentric/eccentric plantar flexion every other day during BRU. One-repetition maximum (1RM) strength was tested on the training device. The angle-specific torque-velocity relationship across 5 velocities (0, 0.52, 1.05, 1.75, and 2.97 rad.s-1) and the full range-of-motion power-velocity relationship were assessed on a dynamometer. Torque-position analyses identified strength changes at shortened, neutral, and stretched muscle lengths. Concentric and eccentric contractile work were measured across ten repetitions at 1.05 rad.s-1. Maximal neural activation was measured by surface electromyography (EMG). 1RM decreased 9% in NOE and improved 11% in REX (P < 0.05). Concentric (0.52 and 1.05 rad.s-1), eccentric (0.52 and 2.97 rad.s-1), and isometric angle-specific torques decreased (P < 0.05) in NOE, averaging 18%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. Power dropped (P < 0.05) in NOE at three eccentric (21%) and two concentric (14%) velocities. REX protected angle-specific torque and average power at all velocities. Concentric and eccentric strength decreased at stretched (16%) and neutral (17%) muscle lengths (P < 0.05) in NOE while REX maintained or improved strength at all joint positions. Concentric (15%) and eccentric (11%) contractile work fell in NOE (P < 0.05) but not in REX. Maximal plantar flexor EMG did not change in either group. In summary, constant resistance concentric/eccentric REX completely prevented plantar flexor performance deconditioning induced by BRU.

CNS relapses have become uncommon with the use of high-dose cytarabine based regimens. The features associated with a higher risk of CNS relapse are not defined. Method(s): We analyzed adults who presented with AML and CNS relapses from 2000 until 2014. CNS leukemia was diagnosed by the presence of blasts in a cytocentrifuge preparation of CSF. Pts with blasts in the CSF together with high numbers of red blood cells (> 5) were not considered to have CNS disease if the blasts were high in the PB. Result(s): Of the 1312 pts with AML treated at our institution, 71 (5%) had CNS disease. Median age was 57 years. CNS involvement was detected after a median of 8 months from the initial diagnosis. 4 pts (6%) had isolated CNS relapse that was followed by systemic relapse after a median of 2 weeks. CNS involvement was detected in the setting of refractory AML in 31 pts (44%). 64 pts (90%) received previous high-dose cytarabine. 54 pts (76%) had neurologic symptoms at time of CNS relapse. CNS imaging was performed in 67 pts (94%): 41 (61%) had abnormal findings by MRI suggestive of CNS disease. 4 pts had zero cells with blasts detected on cytocentrifuge preparation only. None of the 4 pts had circulating blasts and all had abnormal findings on brain MRI suggestive of CNS relapse. 18 pts (25%) were FLT3-ITD mutated. CNS involvement was more commonly observed in young pts with increased WBC, BM blasts, and LDH, with M4/M5 phenotype, and FLT3/ITD mutated (12% versus 5%, p=0.003). Treatment for CNS disease consisted of IT chemotherapy in all pts, whole brain radiation therapy in 14, and spinal radiation in 8. Therapy was successful in clearing all signs of CNS disease in 29 (41%). 19 of the 29 pts (65%) subsequently had additional CNS relapses after a median of 3 months.

5,"Effect of gamma-radiation of an extremely high dose on the cerebral cortex of the rat (ultrastructural aspects). [Russian] For 24 h after total gamma-radiation of mature Wistar male rats (180-210 g) in the dose of 150 Gy, ultrastructural rearrangements of the cerebral sensomotor cortex are presented as small destructive changes in neurons, neuroglia and vascular endothelium. Total combination of the changes in ultrastructure of the blood capillaries and perivascular astrocytes makes it possible to suppose that permeability of the microvascular bed wall is increased. At this period, together with the destructive changes there are evidently certain compensatory-restorative processes, developing in the cerebral tissue. It is possible to suppose that already during the first hours after the radiation the ultrastructural changes of neurons are resulted not only from the direct effect of radiation, but from certain influences of the radiation damage of neuroglia and microvessels.",Included
479,"Modulation of pain perception by transcranial magnetic stimulation of left prefrontal cortex Evidence by functional imaging studies suggests the role of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the inhibitory control of nociceptive transmission system. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is able to modulate pain response to capsaicin. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of DLPFC activation (through rTMS) on nociceptive control in a model of capsaicin-induced pain. The study was performed on healthy subjects that underwent capsaicin application on right or left hand. Subjects judged the pain induced by capsaicin through a 0-100 VAS scale before and after 5 Hz rTMS over left and right DLPFC at 10 or 20 min after capsaicin application in two separate groups (8 subjects each). Left DLPFC-rTMS delivered either at 10 and 20 min after capsaicin application significantly decreased spontaneous pain in both hands. Right DLPFC rTMS showed no significant effect on pain measures. According to these results, stimulation of left DLPFC seems able to exert a bilateral control on pain system, supporting the critical antinociceptive role of such area. This could open new perspectives to non-invasive brain stimulation protocols of alternative target area for pain treatment.",Excluded
291,"Photoinactivation of an identified motoneurone in the locust Locusta migratoria 1. The common inhibitory motoneurone 1 (CI1) in the mesothoracic ganglion of the locust was photoinactivated using a helium-cadmium laser or a mercury lamp as light source. Treated animals showed no signs of abnormal locomotory behaviour over periods of up to 40 days. 2. Photoinactivation of part of the neurone in the ganglion, i.e. the soma and the primary neurite, is sufficient to cause irreversible degeneration of all the peripheral extensions of the neurone. Three weeks after photoinactivation, all GABA immunoreactivity had disappeared from the axon branches of the photoinactivated neurone and from their terminals on one of the target muscles investigated, the anterior coxa rotator M92, and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials could no longer be elicited through stimulation. This was taken as proof of functional denervation of the muscle with regard to its inhibitory input. By this time, the axon of CI1 in nerve N3C1, which supplies M92, had also disappeared. 3. Animals treated during the fourth or fifth instars showed a permanent loss of the photoinactivated mesothoracic CI1 neurone after moulting into adulthood. 4. Denervation of M92 in the middle legs of instars and adults by axotomy of N3 always led to rapid functional reinnervation of the muscle. The first sign of reinnervation (excitatory neuromuscular activity upon mechanical stimulation of the tarsi) was detected electrophysiologically as early as 8 days after severing the motor nerve. 5. The elimination of CI1 by photoinactivation for a period of up to 40 days did not influence parameters of the target muscle, such as size, number of fibres and phenotypes of fibres defined histochemically according to their myofibrillar ATPase isoforms, irrespective of whether the operation was performed in instars or adults. Similarly, the short period of denervation following axotomy before reinnervation took place did not affect the fibre type composition of the muscle.",Excluded

541,"CEST signal at 2ppm (CEST@2ppm) from Z-spectral fitting correlates with creatine distribution in brain tumor In general, multiple components such as water direct saturation, magnetization transfer (MT), chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and aliphatic nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) contribute to the Z-spectrum. The conventional CEST quantification method based on asymmetrical analysis may lead to quantification errors due to the semi-solid MT asymmetry and the aliphatic NOE located on a single side of the Z-spectrum. Fitting individual contributors to the Z-spectrum may improve the quantification of each component. In this study, we aim to characterize the multiple exchangeable components from an intracranial tumor model using a simplified Z-spectral fitting method. In this method, the Z-spectrum acquired at low saturation RF amplitude (50 Hz) was modeled as the summation of five Lorentzian functions that correspond to NOE, MT effect, bulk water, amide proton transfer (APT) effect and a CEST peak located at +2 ppm, called CEST@2ppm. With the pixel-wise fitting, the regional variations of these five components in the brain tumor and the normal brain tissue were quantified and summarized. Increased APT effect, decreased NOE and reduced CEST@2ppm were observed in the brain tumor compared with the normal brain tissue. Additionally, CEST@2ppm decreased with tumor progression. CEST@2ppm was found to correlate with the creatine concentration quantified with proton MRS. Based on the correlation curve, the creatine contribution to CEST@2ppm was quantified. The CEST@2ppm signal could be a novel imaging surrogate for in vivo creatine, the important bioenergetics marker. Given its noninvasive nature, this CEST MRI method may have broad applications in cancer bioenergetics.",Excluded
495,"Hairy and emc negatively regulate morphogenetic furrow progression in the Drosophila eye The initial steps of pattern formation in the developing Drosophila eye involve the coordination of cell cycles, changes in cell shape, and the specification of the R8 photoreceptor cell. These events begin several cell rows ahead of the morphogenetic furrow and are positively regulated by secreted signaling proteins and the proneural HLH transcription factor atonal (ato). Two HLH regulatory proteins that function to suppress neuronal development in other tissues, extra macrochaetae (emc) and hairy (h), are expressed ahead of the morphogenetic furrow. While neither h nor emc is required for photoreceptor cell determination, in emc-h-clones the morphogenetic furrow and differentiated eye field advance up to eight ommatidial rows ahead of adjacent wild-type tissue. This indicates that morphogenetic furrow progression and neuronal differentiation are negatively regulated by a combination of anteriorly expressed HLH regulatory proteins.",Excluded

Of these patients, 50 were selected because they developed radiation retinopathy; 45 of these were treated with sector scatter laser photocoagulation to regress clinically evident radiation retinopathy. 16 additional patients (considered to be ""high risk"" to develop radiation retinopathy) were also treated.RESULTS: Radiation retinopathy was noted to appear at a mean interval of 26 months following plaque treatment. Laser photocoagulation regressed radiation retinopathy in 29 (64.4%) of the 45 patients treated after the onset of radiation retinopathy (17 with only retinopathy, 10 with a combination of retinopathy and maculopathy, and two with only maculopathy). Of the 16 patients who received laser treatment before clinical evidence of retinopathy, one developed radiation maculopathy and two retinopathy without maculopathy (all three responded to additional laser photocoagulation). In the 45 patient group, vision loss of more than three lines was attributable to radiation maculopathy in seven (15.5%). None of the patients in the prophylactic laser group lost more than three lines of vision as a result of maculopathy.CONCLUSION: Sector scatter argon laser photocoagulation induced regression of radiation retinopathy. Though early treatment of radiation retinopathy appears to be more effective, a more long term and prospective randomised study will be needed to prove efficacy.",Excluded
1023,"Control of recollection by slow gamma dominating mid-frequency gamma in hippocampus CA1 Behavior is used to assess memory and cognitive deficits in animals like Fmr1-null mice that model Fragile X Syndrome, but behavior is a proxy for unknown neural events that define cognitive variables like recollection. We identified an electrophysiological signature of recollection in mouse dorsal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampus. During a shocked-place avoidance task, slow gamma (SG) (30-50 Hz) dominates mid-frequency gamma (MG) (70-90 Hz) oscillations 2-3 s before successful avoidance, but not failures. Wild-type (WT) but not Fmr1-null mice rapidly adapt to relocating the shock; concurrently, SG/MG maxima (SGdom) decrease in WT but not in cognitively inflexible Fmr1-null mice. During SGdom, putative pyramidal cell ensembles represent distant locations; during place avoidance, these are avoided places. During shock relocation, WT ensembles represent distant locations near the currently correct shock zone, but Fmr1-null ensembles represent the formerly correct zone. These findings indicate that recollection occurs when CA1 SG dominates MG and that accurate recollection of inappropriate memories explains Fmr1-null cognitive inflexibility.",Excluded
467,"A hot-sensing cold receptor: C-terminal domain determines thermosensation in transient receptor potential channels Temperature transduction in mammals is possible because of the presence of a set of temperature-dependent transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in dorsal root ganglia neurons and skin cells. Six thermo-TRP channels, all characterized by their unusually high temperature sensitivity (Q10 > 10), have been cloned: TRPV1-4 are heat activated, whereas TRPM8 and TRPA1 are activated by cold. Because of the lack of structural information, the molecular basis for regulation by temperature remains unknown. In this study, we assessed the role of the C-terminal domain of thermo-TRPs and its involvement in thermal activation by using chimeras between the heat receptor TRPV1 and the cold receptor TRPM8, in which the entire C-terminal domain was switched. Here, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain is modular and confers the channel phenotype regarding temperature sensitivity, channel gating kinetics, and PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphophate) modulation. Thus, thermo-TRP channels contain an interchangeable specific region, different from the voltage sensor, which allows them to sense temperature stimuli.",Excluded

665,"Phase 1/2 study of dianhydrogalactitol (VAL-083) with radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed, mgmt-unmethylated glioblastoma Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer. Current standard-of-care includes surgery followed by chemoradiation and temozolomide. An unmethylated promoter for O6-methylguanine- DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) is a validated biomarker for temozolomide-resistance and is strongly correlated with poor outcomes. Unmethylated MGMT represents the majority of newly diagnosed GBM tumors. VAL-083 is a first-in-class bi-functional DNA-targeting agent that has shown activity against GBM in NCI-sponsored clinical trials both as single agent and in combination with radiotherapy. VAL-083 induces interstrand cross-links at N7-guanine, leading to DNA double-strand breaks and cell-death. VAL-083s unique mechanism-of-action circumvents MGMT-mediated chemoresistance, and it has demonstrated cytotoxicity in MGMT-unmethylated GBM cell-lines, cancer stem cells (CSCs) and in vivo models. Furthermore, VAL-083 acts as a radiosensitizer in GBM CSCs and non-CSCs. We completed a dose-escalation trial of VAL-083 in recurrent GBM, and a generally well-tolerated dosing regimen was selected for further clinical development. The present trial is an ongoing open-label, biomarker-driven, Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of VAL-083 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed MGMTunmethylated GBM patients.

All the components of visual pathway including lenses, eyeballs, retinas, optic nerves, chiasm, optic tracts, optic radiations and visual occipital cortexes were contoured. Result(s): 11 patients were male (55%) and 9 were female (45%). Age median was 56 years. The range of dose/fraction and total prescribed dose were 1.8-3 Gy and 36-70.4 Gy respectively.

Seven patients experienced more than one color, while 2 patients did not attribute any special color to their light seeing experiences. Four patients had a kind of smell experience and 1 patient had a taste experience. Conclusion(s): Cherenkov radiation in eye ballsmay be the origin of light seeing experiences in patients receiving radiation treatment for head and neck malignancies, since treatmentsareperformed with ionizing radiations with energycapable to produce this effect. Also this effectmay be due to phosphenes produced by radiation treatment in different parts of the visual pathway (from retina to visual cortex).

Aim: We assess the percentage of cases in which findings of distant disease through 18F-FDG PET/CT for radiotherapy planning lead to changes in the modality and/or intent of the treatment, or change in stage IV. Material(s) and Method(s): All the studies derived from the Radiotherapy department were retrospectively analysed. Those performed for radiotherapy planning were selected. Cases with distant disease findings were assessed, investigating changes in the modality or intent of treatment and change in stage IV. One thousand four hundred seventy six studies were derived from the Radiotherapy department between April/09 and December/13. Three hundred and seventy three (25,3%) were performed for radiotherapy planning (267 males and 106 females, mean age 68.2 years). The intention of radiotherapy was for radical treatment planning. Result(s): In 45 of these studies (12%) there were previously not suspected findings that suggested an upstage of the patients to a clinical stage IV. The unexpected disease was located more frequently in bone (12 patients), followed by lung (9 patients), liver (10), distant adenopathy (6 patients), brain (4 patients), adrenal glands (4 patients), spleen (1 patient) and multiple progression (1 patient).In twenty-six (26/45, 7%) of these patients the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT were confirmed as true positive for distant metastasis with complementary examinations. In sixteen (16/26) of them the modality of treatment was changed. In ten of them (10/26) the intent of treatment was changed from curative to palliative. In three patients a second primary tumour was confirmed.In remaining sixteen (16/45) patients the results of 18F-FDG PET/CT could not be initially confirmed. The confirmation was made by monitoring progression in eleven patients, one patient remained with stable disease and four patients died without being able to confirm the findings. Conclusion(s): 18F-FDG PET/CT studies in radiotherapy planning improve the staging of patients, leading to an upstage in a significant number of patients. Based upon the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT, the modality or the intent of treatment may radically change, (making unnecessary radiation) or changing the intent to palliative.",Excluded

Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) starts at 2 weeks after 1st infusion of bevacizumab and continues for 5 weeks. Total mesorectal excision is planned at 6-8 weeks post CRT. Immunohistochemical staining to study the functionality of blood vessels and Luminex analyses to assess the changes in circulating VEGF ligands are performed on tissues and blood samples from consenting pts. Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, safety profile and identification of biomarkers for early response prediction are the main endpoints. Result(s): Sixty five pts with median age 60 have been enrolled to date. Fifty seven pts completed the full protocol scheme, with a relative dose intensity of 97% for bevacizumab, 95% for capecitabine and 93% for oxaliplatin. Preliminary safety data from 60 evaluable pts show that the regimen is generally well tolerated. Most severe adverse events were post-operative (wound infections, leaks) in 9 pts, equally distributed between arms. During CRT, grade 3 toxicities were more frequent in Arm A: fatigue (1), diarrhea (2), infection (2), febrile neutropenia (1), sensory neuropathy (1). Two pts deceased due to disease progression and one due to lung embolism post-surgery. Fifty two pts are evaluable for response. pCR was seen in 11 pts, 30% (8/26) in Arm A and 12% (3/26) in Arm B (p = 0.08). The rate of good responders (Dworak TRG 3,4) was higher in Arm A 18/26 versus Arm B 10/26 (p = 0.05).

Conclusion(s): Chemoradiotherapy in combination with bevacizumab showed an acceptable safety profile in this patient population. Adding oxaliplatin determined a slight increase of toxicity but might enhance the percentage of responders. PDGF may be a predictor of response in this setting. Further analyses are ongoing.

790,"Presenilin 1 deficiency alters the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in cultured cortical neurons Presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2, respectively) play a critical role in mediating gamma-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Numerous mutations in the presenilins are known to cause early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). In addition, it is well established that PS1 deficiency leads to altered intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis involving endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. However, there has been little evidence suggesting Ca(2+) signals from extracellular sources are influenced by PS1. Here we report that the Ca(2+) currents carried by voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels are increased in PS1-deficient cortical neurons. This increase is mediated by a significant increase in the contributions of L- and P-type Ca(2+) channels to the total voltage-mediated Ca(2+) conductance in PS1 (-/-) neurons. In addition, chelating intracellular Ca(2+) with 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) produced an increase in Ca(2+) current amplitude that was comparable to the increase caused by PS1 deficiency. In contrast to this, BAPTA had no effect on voltage-dependent Ca(2+) conductances in PS1-deficient neurons. These data suggest that PS1 deficiency may influence voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel function by means that involve intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. These findings reveal that PS1 functions at multiple levels to regulate and stabilize intracellular Ca(2+) levels that ultimately control neuronal firing behavior and influence synaptic transmission.",Excluded

Herein, some effects of in situ helium neon (HeNe) laser irradiation on rat nerve-muscle preparation injected with Bothrops jararacussu venom are described. The tibialis anterior muscle was injected with venom diluted in 0.9% saline solution (60 microg/0.02 mL) or saline solution alone. Sixty minutes after venom injection, laser (HeNe) treatment was administered at three incident energy densities: dose 1, a single exposure of 3.5 J cm(-2); dose 2, three exposures of 3.5 J cm(-2); dose 3, a single exposure of 10.5 J cm(-2). Muscle function was assessed through twitch tension recordings whereas muscle damage was evaluated through histopathologic analysis, morphometry of area of tissue affected and creatine kinase (CK) serum levels, and compared to unirradiated muscles. Laser application at the dose of 3.5 J cm(-2) reduced the area of injury by 64% (15.9 +/- 1.5%vs 44.2 +/- 5.7%), decreased the neuromuscular blockade (NMB) by 62% (11.5 +/- 2.5%vs 30.4 +/- 5.2%) and reduced CK levels by 58% (from 455 +/- 4.5% to 190.3 +/- 23.4%) when compared with unirradiated controls. Dose 2 showed a poorer benefit than dose 1, and dose 3 was ineffective in preventing the venom effects. Measurements of the absorbance of unirradiated and irradiated venom solution showed no difference in absorption spectra. In addition, no difference in the intensity of partial NMB in nerve-muscle preparation was shown by unirradiated and irradiated venom. The results indicate that the laser light did not alter venom toxicity. We conclude that HeNe laser irradiation at a dosage of 3.5 J cm(-2) effectively reduces myonecrosis and the neuromuscular transmission blocking effect caused by B. jararacussu snake venom. Thus, low level laser therapy may be a promising tool to minimize the severity of some of the local effects of snake envenoming.",Excluded
717,"Pain flare following external beam radiotherapy and meaningful change in pain scores in the treatment of bone metastases BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To examine the incidence of pain flare following external beam radiotherapy and to determine what constitutes a meaningful change in pain scores in the treatment of bone metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases treated with external beam radiotherapy were asked to score their pain on a scale of 0-10 before the treatment (baseline), daily during the treatment and for 10 days after completion of external beam radiation. Pain flare was defined as a two-point increase from baseline pain in the pain scale of 0-10 with no decrease in analgesic intake or a 25% increase in analgesic intake employing daily oral morphine equivalent with no decrease in pain score. To distinguish pain flare from progression of pain, we required the pain score and analgesic intake to return back to baseline levels after the increase/flare. They were also asked to indicate if their pain changed during that time compared to pre-treatment level. The change in pain score was compared with patient perception.RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were evaluated in this study. There were 49 male and 39 female patients with the median age of 70 years. Twelve of 88 patients (14%) had pain flare on day 1. The overall incidence of pain flare during the study period ranged from 2 to 16%. A total of 797 pain scorings were obtained. Patients perceived an improvement in pain when their self-reported pain score decreased by at least two points.CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the occurrence of pain flare following the external beam radiotherapy in the treatment of bone metastases. Further studies are required to predict who are at risk for flare. Appropriate measures can be taken to alleviate the pain flare. The finding in the meaningful change in pain scores supports the investigator-defined partial response used in some clinical trials.",Excluded

Patients recorded pain severity and analgesic requirements on self-assessment questionnaires before treatment, at 2 weeks and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Pain relief was the primary endpoint of treatment benefit. Short-term side-effects were compared in a subset of 133 consecutive patients who graded nausea, vomiting and antiemetic usage prior to treatment and at daily intervals from days I to 14.RESULTS: Overall survival at 12 months was 44%, with no statistically significant difference apparent between randomised groups. There were no differences in the time to first improvement in pain, time to complete pain relief or in time to first increase in pain at any time up to 12 months from randomisation, nor in the class of analgesic used. Retreatment was twice as common after 8 Gy than after multifraction radiotherapy, although retreatment for residual or recurrent pain did not reflect a difference between randomised groups in the probability of pain relief. The difference in the rate of retreatment is thought to reflect a greater readiness to prescribe radiotherapy after a single fraction, not a greater need. There were no significant differences in the incidence of nausea, vomiting, spinal cord compression or pathological fracture between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: A single fraction of 8 Gy is as safe and effective as a multifraction regimen for the palliation of metastatic bone pain for at least 12 months. The greater convenience and lower cost make 8 Gy single fraction the treatment of choice for the majority of patients.",Excluded
666,"Model making of radioactive optic nerve injury. [Chinese] Background: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a severe complication after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, which threatens the visual acuity and quality of life of patients. Till now, there is no recognized treatment for RION. It is of great significance to study the natural progression of the RION, and to prevent and treat RION. Objective(s): This study was to establish an ideal radioactive optic nerve injury animal model. Method(s): Healthy 8-week SD rats with hygiene grade were randomly divided into normal control group and model group, with 6 rats in each group. The total 30 Gy dose of radiation with 3 portions was used to irradiate the head model group rats; ELISA was performed to analysis the changes of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and Von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentrations in blood 2, 4 and 8 weeks after irradiation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscope were performed to observe the changes of optic structure. The use and care of the experimental animals complied with the ARVO statement. Result(s): The concentrations of ET-1 in the model group were (23.18 +/- 0.11), (27.98 +/- 0.22), (33.90 +/- 0.11), (65.25 +/- 0.38) and (43.82 +/- 0.09) pg/ml before irradiation, 1 day, 2, 4, 6 weeks after irradiation, those in the normal control group were (22.65 +/- 0.14), (23.18 +/- 0.19), (23.68 +/- 0.15), (24.23 +/- 0.12) and (23.58 +/- 0.16) pg/ml. The concentrations of vWF in the model group were (63.16 +/- 2.21), (88.32 +/- 2.06), (123.38 +/- 1.36), (191.40 +/- 0.61) and (141.69 +/- 0.82) pg/ml before irradiation, 1 day, 2, 4, 6 weeks after irradiation, those in the normal control group were (62.82 +/- 1.56), (63.35 +/- 2.06), (64.12 +/- 1.76), (63.52 +/- 2.02) and (63.48 +/- 1.55)pg/ml. There were significant differences of ET-1 and vWF concentrations among different groups and time points (ET-1: F<inf>group</inf>=32.160, P=0.012 ; F<inf>time</inf>=21.180, P=0.023.vWF: F<inf>group</inf>=73.110, P=0.001; F<inf>time</inf>=46.180, P=0.002). The nerve fiber bundles was swelled with disordered arrangement and vacuolization 8 weeks after irradiation. Axon swell and atrophy, axons with myelin sheath layer plate separation were obtained. The rates of axon demyelination in the normal control group and model group were (1.35 +/- 0.79)% and (14.44 +/- 2.32)%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (t=14.07, P<0.01). Conclusion(s): The total 30 Gy dose of radiation on the head of rats can make stable radioactive optic nerve injury model. This model making method is simple, cheap and practical, which is worth further study. Copyright © 2016 by the Chinese Medical Association.",Included

96,"Single Vocal Cord Irradiation: Image Guided Intensity Modulated Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for T1a Glottic Cancer: Early Clinical Results PURPOSE: To report, from a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, on the feasibility, outcome, toxicity, and voice-handicap index (VHI) of patients with T1a glottic cancer treated by a novel intensity modulated radiation therapy technique developed at our institution to treat only the involved vocal cord: single vocal cord irradiation (SVCI).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with T1a glottic cancer were treated by means of SVCI. Dose prescription was set to 16 x 3.63 Gy (total dose 58.08 Gy). The clinical target volume was the entire vocal cord. Setup verification was done by means of an online correction protocol using cone beam computed tomography. Data for voice quality assessment were collected prospectively at baseline, end of treatment, and 4, 6, and 12 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment using VHI questionnaires.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 7-50 months), the 2-year local control and overall survival rates were 100% and 90% because no single local recurrence was reported and 3 patients died because of comorbidity. All patients have completed the intended treatment schedule; no treatment interruptions and no grade 3 acute toxicity were reported. Grade 2 acute dermatitis or dysphagia was reported in only 5 patients (17%). No serious late toxicity was reported; only 1 patient developed temporary grade 2 laryngeal edema, and responded to a short-course of corticosteroid. The VHI improved significantly, from 33.5 at baseline to 9.5 and 10 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively (P<.001). The control group, treated to the whole larynx, had comparable local control rates (92.2% vs 100%, P=.24) but more acute toxicity (66% vs 17%, P<.0001) and higher VHI scores (23.8 and 16.7 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively, P<.0001).CONCLUSION: Single vocal cord irradiation is feasible and resulted in maximal local control rate at 2 years. The deterioration in VHI scores was slight and temporary and subsequently improved to normal levels. Long-term follow-up is needed to consolidate these promising results.",Excluded

1038,"Respiratory modulation of human autonomic function on Earth KEY POINTS: We studied healthy supine astronauts on Earth with electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial pressure, respiratory carbon dioxide concentrations, breathing depth and sympathetic nerve recordings. The null hypotheses were that heart beat interval fluctuations at usual breathing frequencies are baroreflex mediated, that they persist during apnoea, and that autonomic responses to apnoea result from changes of chemoreceptor, baroreceptor or lung stretch receptor inputs. R-R interval fluctuations at usual breathing frequencies are unlikely to be baroreflex mediated, and disappear during apnoea. The subjects' responses to apnoea could not be attributed to changes of central chemoreceptor activity (hypocapnia prevailed); altered arterial baroreceptor input (vagal baroreflex gain declined and muscle sympathetic nerve burst areas, frequencies and probabilities increased, even as arterial pressure climbed to new levels); or altered pulmonary stretch receptor activity (major breathing frequency and tidal volume changes did not alter vagal tone or sympathetic activity). Apnoea responses of healthy subjects may result from changes of central respiratory motoneurone activity.ABSTRACT: We studied eight healthy, supine astronauts on Earth, who followed a simple protocol: they breathed at fixed or random frequencies, hyperventilated and then stopped breathing, as a means to modulate and expose to view important, but obscure central neurophysiological mechanisms. Our recordings included the electrocardiogram, finger photoplethysmographic arterial pressure, tidal volume, respiratory carbon dioxide concentrations and peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity. Arterial pressure, vagal tone and muscle sympathetic outflow were comparable during spontaneous and controlled-frequency breathing. Compared with spontaneous, 0.1 and 0.05 Hz breathing, however, breathing at usual frequencies (~0.25 Hz) lowered arterial baroreflex gain, and provoked smaller arterial pressure and R-R interval fluctuations, which were separated by intervals that were likely to be too short and variable to be attributed to baroreflex physiology. R-R interval fluctuations at usual breathing frequencies disappear during apnoea, and thus cannot provide evidence for the existence of a central respiratory oscillation. Apnoea sets in motion a continuous and ever changing reorganization of the relations among stimulatory and inhibitory inputs and autonomic outputs, which, in our study, could not be attributed to altered chemoreceptor, baroreceptor, or pulmonary stretch receptor activity. We suggest that responses of healthy subjects to apnoea are driven importantly, and possibly prepotently, by changes of central respiratory motoneurone activity. The companion article extends these observations and asks the question, Might terrestrial responses to our 20 min breathing protocol find expression as long-term neuroplasticity in serial measurements made over 20 days during and following space travel?",Excluded
451,"Inflammation and cancer-related fatigue: Mechanisms, contributing factors, and treatment implications Fatigue is one of the most common and distressing side effects of cancer and its treatment, and may persist for years after treatment completion in otherwise healthy survivors. Guided by basic research on neuro-immune interactions, a growing body of research has examined the hypothesis that cancer-related fatigue is driven by activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine network. In this review, we examine the current state of the evidence linking inflammation and cancer-related fatigue, drawing from recent human research and from experimental animal models probing effects of cancer and cancer treatment on inflammation and fatigue. In addition, we consider two key questions that are currently driving research in this area: what are the neural mechanisms of fatigue, and what are the biological and psychological factors that influence the onset and/or persistence of inflammation and fatigue in cancer patients and survivors? Identification of the mechanisms driving cancer-related fatigue and associated risk factors will facilitate the development of targeted interventions for vulnerable patients. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
718,"Dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of radiation-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases: a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial BACKGROUND: Pain flare occurs after palliative radiotherapy, and dexamethasone has shown potential for prevention of such flare. We aimed to compare the efficacy of dexamethasone with that of placebo in terms of reduction of incidence of pain flare.METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, patients from 23 Canadian centres were randomly allocated (1:1) with a web-based system and minimisation algorithm to receive either two 4 mg dexamethasone tablets or two placebo tablets taken orally at least 1 h before the start of radiation treatment (a single 8 Gy dose to bone metastases; day 0) and then every day for 4 days after radiotherapy (days 1-4). Patients were eligible if they had a non-haematological malignancy and bone metastasis (or metastases) corresponding to the clinically painful area or areas. Patients reported their worst pain scores and opioid analgesic intake before treatment and daily for 10 days after radiation treatment. They completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life QLQ-C15-PAL, the bone metastases module (EORTC QLQ-BM22), and the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire at baseline, and at days 10 and 42 after radiation treatment. Pain flare was defined as at least a two-point increase on a scale of 0-10 in the worst pain score with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% or greater increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in the worst pain score from days 0-10, followed by a return to baseline levels or below. Primary analysis of incidence of pain flare was by intention-to-treat (patients with missing primary data were classified as having pain flare). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01248585, and is completed.FINDINGS: Between May 30, 2011, and Dec 11, 2014, 298 patients were enrolled. 39 (26%) of 148 patients randomly allocated to the dexamethasone group and 53 (35%) of 150 patients in the placebo group had a pain flare (difference 8.9%, lower 95% confidence bound 0.0, one-sided p=0.05). Two grade 3 and one grade 4 biochemical hyperglycaemic events occurred in the dexamethasone group (without known clinical effects) compared with none in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were bone pain (61 [41%] of 147 vs 68 [48%] of 143), fatigue (58 [39%] of 147 vs 49 [34%] of 143), constipation (47 [32%] of 147 vs 37 [26%] of 143), and nausea (34 [23%] of 147 vs 34 [24%] of 143), most of which were mild grade 1 or 2.INTERPRETATION: Dexamethasone reduces radiation-induced pain flare in the treatment of painful bone metastases.FUNDING: The NCIC CTG's programmatic grant from the Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute.",Excluded
87,"Surgical techniques in radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients BACKGROUND: Radiation induced brain injury ranges from acute reversible edema to late, irreversible radiation necrosis. Radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis is associated with permanent neurological deficits and occasionally progresses to death.OBJECTIVE: We present our experience with surgery on radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis (RTLN) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with special consideration of clinical presentation, surgical technique, and outcomes.METHOD: This retrospective study includes 12 patients with RTLN treated by the senior author between January 2010 and December 2014. Patients initially sought medical treatment due to headache; other symptoms were hearing loss, visual deterioration, seizure, hemiparesis, vertigo, memory loss and agnosia. A temporal approach through a linear incision was performed for all cases. RTLN was found in one side in 7 patients, and bilaterally in 5. 4 patients underwent resection of necrotic tissue bilaterally and 8 patients on one side.RESULTS: No death occurred in this series of cases. There were no post-operative complications, except 1 patient who developed aseptic meningitis. All 12 patients were free from headache. No seizure occurred in patients with preoperative epilepsy. Other symptoms such as hemiparesis and vertigo improved in all patients. Memory loss, agnosia and hearing loss did not change post-operatively in all cases. The follow-up MR images demonstrated no recurrence of necrotic lesions in all 12 patients.CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical intervention through a temporal approach with linear incision is warranted in patients with radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis with significant symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure, minimum space occupying effect on imaging, or neurological deterioration despite conservative management.",Excluded
349,"Understanding and tackling differing vascular niches in glioma Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most belligerent adult brain tumor, which is defined by its aggressive growth due to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, diffuse infiltration and invasion, propensity for necrosis and hypoxia, and vigorous angiogenesis. Recurrence of these invasive tumors is inevitable despite advanced multimodal therapy with surgery followed by radiation and temozolomide treatment resulting in a dismal median survival of beyond one year. A recent milestone in glioma research has been the revelation that therapies targeting other cell types besides tumor cells; i.e., the cell constituents of the vascular niche can convey substantial improvements in radiographic response, progression-free survival, and quality of life. The changing perspective on the environment as a functional contributor represents a profound shift in the approach to biology and therapeutic decisions in GBM. Here, we describe paracrine signaling pathways of the differing vascular niches that regulate angiogenesis or tumor invasiveness and present therapeutic modalities to target those to more efficiently block diffuse and angiogenic GBM growth.",Excluded
608,"Low-dose radiation hypersensitivity in human tumor cell lines: effects of cell-cell contact and nutritional deprivation The hyper-radiosensitivity at low doses recently observed in vitro in a number of cell lines is thought to have important implications for improving tumor radiotherapy. However, cell-cell contact and the cellular environment influence cellular radiosensitivity at higher doses, and they may alter hyper-radiosensitivity in vivo. To confirm this supposition, we investigated the effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on low-dose hypersensitivity in vitro. Cell survival in the low-dose range (3 cGy to 2 Gy) was studied in cells of two human glioma (BMG-1 and U-87) and two human oral squamous carcinoma (PECA-4451 and PECA-4197) lines using a conventional macrocolony assay. The effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance were studied in cells of the BMG-1 cell line, which showed prominent hypersensitivity and induced radioresistance. The induction of growth inhibition, cell cycle delay, micronuclei and apoptosis was also studied at the hyper-radiosensitivity-inducing low doses. Hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance was evident in the cells of all four cell lines to varying extents, with maximum sensitivity at 10-30 cGy, followed by an increase in survival up to 50 cGy-1 Gy. Both the glioma cell lines had more prominent hyper-radiosensitivity than the two squamous carcinoma cell lines. Low doses inducing maximum hyper-radiosensitivity did not cause significant growth inhibition, micronucleation or apoptosis in BMG-1 cells, but a transient G(1)/S-phase block was evident. Irradiating and incubating BMG-1 cells at high density for 0 or 4 h before plating, as well as irradiating cells as microcolonies, reduced hyper-radiosensitivity significantly, indicating the role of cell-cell contact-mediated processes. Liquid holding of BMG-1 cells in HBSS + 1% serum during and after irradiation for 4 h significantly reduced hyper-radiosensitivity, suggesting that hyper-radiosensitivity may be due partly to active damage fixation processes at low doses. Therefore, our findings suggest that the damage-induced signaling mechanisms influenced by (or mediated through) cell-cell contact or the cellular environment, as well as the lesion fixation processes, play an important role in hyper-radiosensitivity. Further studies are required to determine the exact nature of the damage that triggers these responses as well as for evaluating the potential of low-dose therapy.",Excluded
415,"Cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy for metastatic non-small cell carcinoma followed by irradiation in patients with regional disease Forty-four patients with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung were treated every 3 weeks with vinblastine (4 mg/m2/day iv X 2) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2/day iv X 3). Of the 28 patients with metastatic disease, eight (29%; 90% confidence interval of true response, 17%-47%) achieved objective response, for a median duration of 27 weeks. Median survival in this group was 47 and 28 weeks for responders and nonresponders, respectively. Of the 16 patients with advanced regional disease, 11 (69%; 90% confidence interval of true response, 49%-86%) achieved objective response. Thirteen of these patients received consolidation radiotherapy (4500 cGy/25 fractions/5 weeks), with a boost of 1000 cGy/5 fractions/1 week in those patients who achieved response. In the three patients who did not receive radiotherapy, two died during the induction phase, one from grade 4 leukopenia and sepsis and the second from unrelated factors. The third patient had systemic progression of disease during induction chemotherapy. Six patients experienced overall improvement in their chemotherapy response from the radiotherapy. Two patients who did not respond to the chemotherapy achieved partial response with irradiation. Four patients who had partial response to the chemotherapy achieved complete response with irradiation, and seven patients had no further change in their degree of response to irradiation. The overall median survival of this group was 81 weeks. Maintenance chemotherapy was not given. After radiotherapy, the site of first failure was outside the radiation field in nine of 13 patients (69%). Hematologic toxicity was dose-limiting. Other toxic effects that were not dose-limiting included nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and acute nausea and vomiting. In the patients with advanced regional disease, there was no increase in the radiation toxicity attributable to the chemotherapy. We conclude that: (a) this dose schedule of vinblastine and cisplatin has reproducible activity in non-small cell carcinoma of the lung; (b) the response and median survival of patients with advanced regional disease are superior to those of patients with metastatic disease; and (c) in patients with advanced regional disease, treatment with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy yielded an overall response rate of 81% (90% confidence interval of true response, 60%-93%) and improved survival compared to a similar group of patients studied by others receiving radiotherapy alone.

241,"Alteration of disk-shedding patterns by light-onset of higher than normal intensity Rod outer segment (ROS) disk-shedding patterns were determined in the albino rat eye. All of the animals had the same, low-intensity-light histories, but on the day that shedding patterns were to be measured the rats were divided into three groups: one which did not have any lights turned on at 0700 hr ('contained dark' group); one which had normal, 3-lx light turned on ('colony' group); one which had a brighter-than-normal light turned on ('80-lx' group). The 'continued dark' group displayed a broad profile of shedding over time which persisted because phagosomes disappeared so slowly. The 'colony' group showed the same initial rate of phagosome production as did the 'continued dark' group but a much accelerated rate of phagosome disappearance. The '80-lx' group showed no rate of phagosome production; rather there was a simple, rapid exponential disappearance of those phagosomes which existed just prior to light onset. The kinetics of these phenomena are described in a model, rate constants for which were obtained from our data and simulated on an analog computer. The analysis of the three shedding patterns indicates the existence of an intensity-dependent disappearance rate and suggests an inhibition of shedding and/or phagocytosis by intensity greater than that of the usual environment.",Excluded
697,"Cerebral computed tomography angiography using a 70 kVp protocol: improved vascular enhancement with a reduced volume of contrast medium and radiation dose Objectives: To determine the feasibility of using a 70-kVp protocol compared with a 120-kVp protocol for cerebral CT angiography. An additional target was to investigate a possible reduction in the volume of contrast medium (CM) using the 70-kVp protocol. Methods: Attenuation value and CNR for iodine were determined at various tube voltage settings using a phantom. Sixty-nine volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three protocols: group A (120-kVp and CM 64 mL), group B (70-kVp and CM 64 mL), or group C (70-kVp and CM 40 mL). The attenuation value, SNR, and CNR of cerebral arteries, subjective image quality, and radiation dose were compared among the groups. Results: The vascular attenuation, SNR, and CNR of group B were significantly higher than those of group A. Group C had a significantly higher vascular attenuation than group A. Groups B and C were significantly better than group A with respect to subjective image quality. An effective dose of 70-kVp was 10 % lower than that of 120-kVp. Conclusions: Using 70-kVp improved arterial enhancement, SNR, and CNR, and provided better subjective image quality, using a 10 % lower effective dose. Furthermore, the 70-kVp protocol may both reduce volume of CM by 37.5 % and improve arterial enhancement.

216,"Multiwavelength optical intrinsic signal imaging of cortical spreading depression Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is an important disease model for migraine and cerebral ischemia. In this study, we exploit the high temporal and spatial resolution of optical imaging to characterize perfusion-dependent and -independent changes in response to CSD and to investigate the etiology of reflectance changes during CSD. In this experiment, we characterized the optical response to CSD at wavelengths that emphasize perfusion-related changes (610 and 550 nm), and we compared these results with 850 nm and blood volume data. Blood volume changes during CSD were recorded using an intravascular fluorescent dye, Texas Red dextran. We observed triphasic optical signals at 850 and 550 nm characterized by spreading waves of increased, decreased, then increased reflectance (Fig. 1) which expanded at a rate of approximately 3-5 mm/min. The signal at 610 nm had a similar initial phase, but the phase 2 response was slightly more complex, with a parenchymal decrease in reflectance but a vascular increase in reflectance. Reflectance values decreased in phase three. Blood volume signals were delayed relative to the optical intrinsic signals and corresponded temporally to phases 2 and 3. This is the first study to characterize optical imaging of intrinsic signal responses to CSD, in vivo, at multiple wavelengths. The data presented here suggest that changes in light scattering precede perfusion responses, the blood volume increase (phase 2) is accompanied by a reduction in deoxyhemoglobin, and the blood volume decrease (phase 3) is accompanied by an increase in deoxyhemoglobin. Previous studies have suggested the oligemia of spreading depression was a result of decreased metabolic demand. This study suggests that during the oligemic period there is a greater reduction in oxygen delivery than in demand.",Excluded
527,"Urinary cytokines/chemokines pattern in patients with painful bone metastases undergoing external beam radiotherapy experiencing pain flare BACKGROUND: External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is a mainstay for treatment of painful bone metastases. Transient worsening of pain (""pain flare"") occurs in 40% of patients. We investigated the pathophysiology of pain flare through assessment of changes in urinary cytokines/chemokines in patients receiving EBRT for painful bone metastases.METHODS: Urine samples were collected from patients receiving a single 8 Gy fraction for painful bone metastases preparation, day 1 or 2 and on an additional day between days 3 to 5 post radiation. Patients completed a standardized pain and analgesic use diary daily for 10 days following radiation. Patients were deemed to have pain flare if they had a two-point increase from baseline worst pain on 0-10 scale and no decrease in analgesic intake or a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain. The Millipore Milliplex 42-Plex Cyto-kine/Chemokine Kit TM was used to measure urinary levels of a panel of cytokines/chemokines.RESULTS: Forty-six patients consented to the study of which 28 were evaluable (complete urine and diary data), and 83/84 urine samples were available for analysis. Pain flare was experienced by 11 patients (39%). The following cytokines/chemokines were detectable in at least 50% of the patients: EGF, fractalkine, GRO, IL-4, IL-8, interferon gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10), MCP-1, macrophage derived chemokine (MDC), PDGF-AA, sIL-2Ra, TGF-Alpha, VEGF. Comparing patients with or without pain flare EGF, fractalkine, GRO, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MDC, sIL-2Ra, and TGF-alpha increased following radiation in both groups. Patients with pain flare have significant lower levels on IL-8, IP-10, and MDC over time.

909,"Long INterspersed element-1 mobility as a sensor of environmental stresses Long INterspersed element (LINE-1, L1) retrotransposons are the most abundant transposable elements in the human genome, constituting approximately 17%. They move by a ""copy-paste"" mechanism, involving reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate and insertion of its cDNA copy at a new site in the genome. L1 retrotransposition (L1-RTP) can cause insertional mutations, alter gene expression, transduce exons, and induce epigenetic dysregulation. L1-RTP is generally repressed; however, a number of observations collected over about 15 years revealed that it can occur in response to environmental stresses. Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that L1-RTP can play a role in the onset of several neurological and oncological diseases in humans. In recent years, great attention has been paid to the exposome paradigm, which proposes that health effects of an environmental factor should be evaluated considering both cumulative environmental exposures and the endogenous processes resulting from the biological response. L1-RTP could be an endogenous process considered for this application. Here, we summarize the current understanding of environmental factors that can affect the retrotransposition of human L1 elements. Evidence indicates that L1-RTP alteration is triggered by numerous and various environmental stressors, such as chemical agents (heavy metals, carcinogens, oxidants, and drugs), physical agents (ionizing and non-ionizing radiations), and experiential factors (voluntary exercise, social isolation, maternal care, and environmental light/dark cycles).

Method(s): Radiation doses of 131 diagnostic and 75 interventional neuro-angiography cases before installation of Philips Clarity were compared with the same number of cases after installation matched to the number of 3D Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) acquisitions and the number of Xper CTs performed for each case. The dose was mainly dependent on the number of 2D DSA frames and screening time. Radiation dose was measured in centi- Gray per cm2 and time in minutes. Result(s): In the diagnostic cohort, there was the same 68% reduction in the average dose per patient and the average dose per 2D DSA frame, despite a 32% increase in screening time after Clarity.

112,"Static magnetic field exposure affects behavior and learning in rats The present work investigated the behavioral effects of a moderate exposure (1 h per day for 5 consecutive days) to a static magnetic field (SMF, 128 mT) in male rats. SMF effects were evaluated in two sets of control and SMF-exposed rats. One set of animals was used for evaluation of SMF potential effects on emotional behaviors in the elevated plus maze and in the open field. The other set of animals was tested for learning and memory abilities in different procedures of the Morris water maze task. We found no significant difference between control and SMF-exposed rats in anxiety tests. However, the ratio of open arms time in the plus maze was reduced by half in SMF-exposed rats. In the Morris water maze, SMF-exposed rats were partially impaired during the initial learning task as well as in the retention task at one week. We conclude that static magnetic field exposure altered emotional behaviors in the plus maze and led to cognitive impairments, or at least to substantial attention disorders, in the Morris water maze.",Excluded

445,"Parkinson's disease and melanoma: Co-occurrence and mechanisms Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, depletion of dopamine in the striatum and the presence of Lewy bodies. Cancer is uncontrolled growth of cells in the body and migration of these cells from their site of origin to other parts of the body. PD and cancer are two opposite diseases, one arising from cell proliferation and the other from cell degeneration. This fundamental difference is consistent with inverse comorbidity between most cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. However, a positive association of PD and melanoma has been reported which has recently become of significant interest. A link between PD and cancer has been supported by many epidemiological studies, most of which show that PD patients have a lower risk of developing most cancers than the general population. However, the mechanisms underlying this epidemiological observation are not known. In this review we focus on epidemiological studies correlating PD and melanoma and the possible mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of the two diseases. We explore possible explanations for the important observations that more PD patients develop melanoma that would otherwise be expected and vice-versa. Copyright © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

24,"Patch-basis electrocortical source imaging in epilepsy In this study, we developed numerical methods for investigating the sources of epileptic activity from intracranial EEG recordings acquired from intracranial subdural electrodes (iEEG) in patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the epilepsy center of the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). The data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA), which identifies and isolates maximally independent signal components in multi-channel recordings. A realistic individual head model was constructed for a patient undergoing pre-surgical evaluation. Structural models of gray matter, white matter, CSF, skull, and scalp were extracted from pre-surgical MR and post-surgical CT images. The electromagnetic source localization forward problem was solved using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). Source localization was performed using the Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) algorithm. The multiscale patch-basis source space constructed for this purpose includes a large number of dipole elements on the cortical layer oriented perpendicular to the local cortical surface. These source dipoles are combined into overlapping multi-scalepatches. Using this approach, we were able to detect seizure activity on sulcal walls and on gyrus of the cortex.",Excluded
538,"Pharmacological alterations that could underlie radiation-induced changes in associative memory and anxiety It is widely known that ionizing radiation is a physical agent broadly used to kill tumor cells during human cancer therapy. Unfortunately, adjacent normal tissues can concurrently undergo undesirable cell injury. Previous data of our laboratory demonstrated that exposure of developing rats to ionizing radiations induced a variety of behavioral differences respect to controls, including changes in associative memory and in anxiety state. However, there is a lack of data concerning modifications in different related pharmacological intermediaries. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the behavioral differences observed in young animals irradiated at birth might be underlain by early changes in PKCs1 levels which, in turn, could lead to changes in hippocampal GABAergic neurotransmission. Male Wistar rats were irradiated with 5Gy of X rays between 24 and 48 h after birth. Different pharmacological markers related to the affected behavioral tasks were assessed in control and irradiated hippocampus at 15 and 30 days, namely GABAA receptor, GAD65-67, ROS and PKCs1. Results showed that all measured parameters were increased in the hippocampus of 30-days-old irradiated animals. In contrast, in the hippocampus of 15-days-old irradiated animals only the levels of PKCs1 were decreased. These data suggest that PKCs1 might constitute a primary target for neonatal radiation damage on the hippocampus. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that an initial decrease in the levels of this protein can trigger a subsequent compensatory increase that, in turn, could be responsible for the plethora of biochemical changes that might underlie the previously observed behavioral alterations.",Excluded
516,"Physiological changes in glucose differentially modulate the excitability of hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone and orexin neurons in situ The physiological signaling mechanisms that link normal variations in body energy status to the activity of arousal- and metabolism-regulating brain centers are not well understood. The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin/hypocretin types of neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) exert opposing effects on arousal and metabolism. We examined whether shifts in brain extracellular glucose that correspond to physiological changes in blood glucose can alter the electrical output of neurochemically and biophysically defined LH cells in mouse brain slices. Here, we show that physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose dose-dependently enhance the electrical excitability of MCH neurons by inducing depolarization and increasing membrane resistance. We also demonstrate that the same physiological shifts in glucose have the opposite effects on the electrical activity of orexin neurons. We propose that these direct actions of glucose on the arousal- and metabolism-regulating LH neurons play a key role in the translation of normal variations in body energy resources into appropriate changes in arousal and metabolism.",Excluded
281,"[Immunohistochemical detection of hormones in hypophyseal adenomas of the rat after fractionated irradiation] BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the hormones produced in pituitary gland tumours (TM) following fractionated external irradiation in rats. The TM arose in the course of studies on other questions of radiation effects.METHODS: The left neck and skull base of sixty female Wistar rats, 3 to 4 months of age at the beginning of the external irradiation, were subjected to roentgen rays exposure, fractionated to 2 Grays daily, either up to 20, 40 or 60 Gy. The midline of the neck and skull was always inside the radiation field. The animals were sacrificed either 6 months or 12 months after completion of the randomly assigned irradiation protocol. Five non-irradiated rats served as controls.RESULTS: No TM developed in the non-irradiated animals. Out of 60 irradiated rats 9 developed a pituitary TM (15%). In remnants of the normal adenohypophysis we revealed immunohistochemical reactivity for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In the radiation-induced adenomas, 4 TM were immuno-reactive for TSH, 4 for GH, 2 for PRL, and 2 for FSH. The TM did not react with anti-ACTH and anti-LH (luteinizing hormone) anti-sera.CONCLUSIONS: Obviously, irradiation accelerates the development of pituitary gland adenomas. In this series the TM were predominantly incidental findings at necropsies after pretermed follow-up intervals with a variety of hormone-producing cells. On the other hand, four of nine TM were null adenomas. Necropsies of the brain should be carried out routinely in irradiation studies of the skull.",Included

The accurate prognostic prediction of HGG is vital and helpful for clinicians when developing therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we propose a machine learning-based survival prediction model by analyzing clinical and dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters, to improve the performance of the risk model in HGG patients. Method(s): Eight clinical variables and 39 DVH parameters were extracted for each patient, who received radiotherapy for HGG with active follow-up. Ninety-five patients were randomly divided into training and testing cohorts, and we employed random survival forest (RSF), support vector machine (SVM), and Cox proportional hazards (CPHs) models to predict survival. Calibration plots, concordance indexes, and decision curve analyses were used to evaluate the calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility of these three models. Result(s): The RSF model showed the best performance among the three models, with concordance indexes of 0.824 and 0.847 in the training and testing sets, respectively, followed by the SVM (0.792/0.823) and CPH (0.821/0.811) models. Specifically, in the RSF model, we identified age, gross tumor volume (GTV), grade, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and D99 as important variables associated with survival. The AUCs of the testing set were 92.4%, 87.7%, and 84.0% for 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival, respectively. According to this model, HGG patients can be divided into high- and low-risk groups. Conclusion(s): The machine learning-based RSF model integrating both clinical and DVH variables is an improved and useful tool for predicting the survival of HGG patients.

To compare various fractionation schedules, the biologically effective dose (BED) was applied. SBRT dose was calculated with linear-quadratic model and normalized to a 2-Gy equivalent dose (nBED, alpha/beta =2 Gy for spinal cord, alpha/beta =10 Gy for tumor). Doses to a point within the spinal cord that received the maximum dose (Pmax) were checked. Local control failure was defined as progression by imaging study. Overall survival, progression free survival, delivered radiation dose to tumor and spinal cord, and spinal cord Pmax nBED were compared in two groups.RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation doses to tumor margin during SBRT were 51.1 Gy2/10 (retreatment) and 50.7 Gy2/10 (initial treatment). Mean survival was 29.6 months (overall)/20.7 months (retreatment)/ 32.4 months (initial treatment). Mean progression free period was 23.9 months (overall)/18.0 months (retreatment)/ 26.0 months (initial treatment). Radiological control rates of retreatment and initial treatment group were 96%/95% at six months, 81%/89% at 12 months and 79%/90% at 24 months. Among 54 retreatment lesions, 13 lesions showed local control failure during follow-up. With regard to spinal cord radiation dose during SBRT, Spinal cord Pmax nBED was 46.2 Gy2/2 (retreatment) and 48.7 Gy2/2 (initial treatment). In retreatment group, total nBED to spinal cord was a mean of 83.4 Gy2/2.

127,"Oxidative modulation of the transient potassium current IA by intracellular arachidonic acid in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons Oxidative stress affects cellular membrane lipids and proteins. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording we demonstrate differential oxidative inhibition of voltage-gated transient (IA) and delayed rectifier [IK(V)] K+ currents by arachidonic acid (AA) and H2O2 in CA1 neurons in hippocampal slice. We show that intracellular application of 1 pm AA or its non-metabolizable analog eicosatetraynoic acid (100 pm) reduced IA by approximately 42% but did not affect IK(V). AA shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of IA by 12 mV to more negative potentials whereas the rate of inactivation was unchanged. Surprisingly, intracellular glutathione (GSH, 20 mm) enhanced the effect of AA on maximal IA (-62%) and with AA slowed inactivation of IA. The combination of GSH and extracellular ascorbate (0.4 mm) prevented reduction of IA by AA. Intracellular Trolox (a vitamin E analog, 10 microm) reduced IA by 61%and IK(V) by 39%. Like AA, intracellular Trolox caused a 10-mV left shift of IA steady-state inactivation but Trolox and AA did not cause a shift when coapplied. Extracellular Trolox (100 microm) had no effects on IA. H2O2 (80 microm) reduced both IA and IK(V) in a GSH- and ascorbate-sensitive manner and slowed the rate of inactivation of IA by a factor of 2. Coapplication of H2O2 with GSH and extracellular ascorbate caused approximately 22 mV negative shifts of both steady-state inactivation and activation. We conclude that AA is extremely potent in affecting IA by oxidative modifications. Antioxidants can augment these effects, probably by catalysis of the underlying reactions between oxidants and IA channel proteins.",Excluded

The open end of a rectangular waveguide covered with a thin Teflon film served as a radiator. Specific absorption rates at the waveguide outlet, inserted into physiological solution, were in the range of 0-2400 W/kg. Millimeter wave irradiation increased the peak amplitudes, activation rates, and inactivation rates of both ion currents. The changes in A-type K+ current were not dependent on the irradiation frequency. It was shown that the changes in the amplitudes and kinetics of both currents resulted from the temperature rise produced by irradiation. No additional effects of irradiation on A-type K+ current other than thermal were found when tested at the phase transition temperature or in the presence of ethanol. Ethanol reduced the thermal effect of irradiation. Millimeter waves had no effect on the steady-state activation and inactivation curves, suggesting that the membrane surface charge and binding of calcium ions to the membrane in the area of channel locations did not change.",Excluded

We performed intracellular electrical recordings of photoreceptor cells in isolated eyestalks using the discontinuous single electrode-switched voltage-clamp configuration. First, with a razor blade we made an opening in the dorsal cornea to get access to the retina. Thereafter, we inserted a glass electrode through the opening, and penetrated a cell as reported by the recording of a negative potential. Membrane potential was clamped at the photoreceptor's resting potential and a light-pulse was applied to activate currents. Finally, the two light-flash protocol was employed to measure current desensitization and recovery. The first light-flash triggers, after a lag period, the transduction ionic current, which after reaching a peak amplitude decays towards a desensitized state; the second flash, applied at varying time intervals, assesses the state of the light-activated conductance. To characterize the light-elicited current, three parameters were measured: 1) latency (the time elapsed between light flash delivery and the moment in which current achieves 10% of its maximum value); 2) peak current; and 3) desensitization time constant (exponential time constant of the current decay phase). All parameters are affected by the first pulse. To quantify recovery from desensitization, the ratio p2/p1 was employed versus time between pulses. p1 is the peak current evoked by the first light-pulse, and p2 is the peak current evoked by the second pulse. These data were fitted to a sum of exponential functions. Finally, these measurements were carried out as function of circadian time.",Excluded

Although many compounds have been reported to affect the formation of amyloid fibrils and/or other types of protein aggregates, the mechanisms by which they act are not well understood. A large number of compounds appear to act in a nonspecific way affecting several different amyloidogenic proteins. We describe here a detailed study of the mechanism of action of one representative compound, lacmoid, in the context of the inhibition of the aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease. We show that lacmoid binds Abeta(1-40) in a surfactant-like manner and counteracts the formation of all types of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) aggregates.

284,"Technical advances in x-ray microbeam radiation therapy In the last 25 years microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional radiation therapy at large, third generation synchrotrons. In MRT, a multi-slit collimator modulates a kilovoltage x-ray beam on a micrometer scale, creating peak dose areas with unconventionally high doses of several hundred Grays separated by low dose valley regions, where the dose remains well below the tissue tolerance level. Pre-clinical evidence demonstrates that such beam geometries lead to substantially reduced damage to normal tissue at equal tumour control rates and hence drastically increase the therapeutic window. Although the mechanisms behind MRT are still to be elucidated, previous studies indicate that immune response, tumour microenvironment, and the microvasculature may play a crucial role. Beyond tumour therapy, MRT has also been suggested as a microsurgical tool in neurological disorders and as a primer for drug delivery. The physical properties of MRT demand innovative medical physics and engineering solutions for safe treatment delivery. This article reviews technical developments in MRT and discusses existing solutions for dosimetric validation, reliable treatment planning and safety. Instrumentation at synchrotron facilities, including beam production, collimators and patient positioning systems, is also discussed. Specific solutions reviewed in this article include: dosimetry techniques that can cope with high spatial resolution, low photon energies and extremely high dose rates of up to 15 000 Gy s<sup>-1</sup>, dose calculation algorithms-apart from pure Monte Carlo Simulations-to overcome the challenge of small voxel sizes and a wide dynamic dose-range, and the use of dose-enhancing nanoparticles to combat the limited penetrability of a kilovoltage energy spectrum. Finally, concepts for alternative compact microbeam sources are presented, such as inverse Compton scattering set-ups and carbon nanotube x-ray tubes, that may facilitate the transfer of MRT into a hospital-based clinical environment. Intensive research in recent years has resulted in practical solutions to most of the technical challenges in MRT. Treatment planning, dosimetry and patient safety systems at synchrotrons have matured to a point that first veterinary and clinical studies in MRT are within reach. Should these studies confirm the promising results of pre-clinical studies, the authors are confident that MRT will become an effective new radiotherapy option for certain patients.",Excluded

Thirty patients underwent salvage surgery; 23 histopathological reports were available. Clinical and histopathological findings were analyzed for sSBRT (69.6%) and pSBRT (30.4%).RESULTS: Mean time to surgery after sSBRT/pSBRT was 8.3/10.3 mo (P = .64). Reason for surgery included pain (sSBRT/pSBRT: 12.5%/71.4%, P = .25), fractures (sSBRT/pSBRT: 37.5%/28.6%, P = .68), and neurological symptoms (sSBRT/pSBRT: 68.8%/42.9%, P = .24). Radiological tumor progression after sSBRT/pSBRT was seen in 71.4%/42.9% (P = .2). Most specimens displayed viable/proliferative tumor (sSBRT/pSBRT: 62.5%/71.4%, P = .68 and 56.3%/57.1%, P = .97). Few specimens showed soft tissue necrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 20%/28.6%, P = .66), osteonecrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 14.3%/16.7%, P = .89), or bone marrow fibrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 42.9%/33.3%, P = .69).

Conclusion This case is unusual as the initial clinical presentation suggested bowel perforation. This patient also suffered an unusual infection with Clostridium ramosum and Trueperella bernardiae, the latter is a very uncommon isolation. The CT scan showed a pneumoperitoneum which led to the suspicion of bowel perforation. At subsequent laparotomy, no evidence of bowel perforation was noted. The findings of pneumoperitoneum could be explained by culture findings of Clostridium ramosum resulting in a gas forming infection within the necrotic uterine mass. There are very few published case reports describing the clinical manifestations of Trueperella bernardiae, a facultative anaerobic gram-positive coccobacilli. Trueperella bernardiae can be a part of the regular skin flora however it has been the reported pathogen in cases of urinary tract infections, septic arthritis, diabetic foot infection, soft tissue infection, brain abscess and eye infections. We have found no previously reported cases of Trueperella bernardiae causing a uterine infection.",Excluded
426,"An atypical presentation of a salivary gland tumour: A case report Adenoid Cystic Salivary Gland malignancies are uncommon, accounting for approximately 8.4 % of salivary gland tumours. The majority are benign, normally presenting as a slowly growing mass, with the parotid gland being the most commonly affected. We present a case report of a 74-year-oldwoman originally referred to neurology with a 5 month history of pain on the right side of her chin, associated with a sensation of sunburn and a 'feeling of a clumsy tongue'. She had no history of radiation exposure and did not smoke. On examination she was found to have numbness on the right side of her chin, with associated right sided tongue deviation and right-sided tongue wasting and numbness. She was initially investigated for an underlying neurological cause. Her MRI demonstrated an abnormality affecting the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. A subsequent CT Neck and Ultrasound demonstrated a lesion within the right sublingual space, which was biopsied and shown to be an adenoid cystic carcinoma. A radical resection of the lesion was performed, resecting from the floor of mouth and base of tongue, with a right-sided selective neck dissection, approached via mandibulotomy. The procedure also involved the formation of a tracheostomy and reconstruction with a free radial forearm flap to the floor of her mouth. The patient also received adjuvant radiotherapy, an additional intervention shown to increase the 5-year survival in advanced disease. This case demonstrates an abnormal presentation of a salivary gland tumour in a less commonly involved gland, and discusses the impact of surgical intervention in the management of invasive salivary gland malignancies.",Excluded
886,"Radiosurgery from the brain to the spine: 20 years experience Radiosurgery evolved from brain to spine. Mechanical and computer advances in linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery apply precise single/fractional stereotactic radiation to multiple pathologies. During a 10-year span the senior author used proton-beam radiosurgery in over 300 lesions, followed by gamma-knife, adapted and dedicated LINACS, including cyber-knife, in another 700 patients. The last 10 years, experience was accumulated with the Novalis in over 3,000 patients. Novalis uses a beam-shaper in a high-speed delivery LINAC. It operates using conventional circular arc, conformai static beam, dynamic conformai or intensity modulated modes. Patients treated with Novalis at the UCLA since 1997 were evaluated regarding effectiveness, complications and failure. These results were compared with previous 1997 data. Over 4,000 patients with trigeminal neuralgia/intractable pain, arteriovenous malformations/angiomas, metastases, ependymomas, gliomas, meningiomas hemangiopericytomas, schwannomas, adenomas, hemangioblastomas, and chordoma were treated. Spinal lesions were treated with frameless stereotaxis and on-line precision checks. Treatment was expeditious, comfortable and with reduced complications. Success is similar or superior to published data. Reduced treatment time of complex lesions and highly homogeneous dose compares favorably to other radiosurgery. The senior author's experience validates the novel shaped-beam approach. Long-term follow-up supports safety and effectiveness and capability to treat brain and spine. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
928,"Dart-bid (dose-differentiated accelerated radiation therapy, 1.8 Gy twice daily): A novel therapeutic approach for locoregionally advanced, nonresected non-small cell lung cancer Background: A modern treatment approach for non-resected NSCLC comprises radiation dose intensification and short overall treatment times. We report on patients treated within a prospective trial, correlating doses to tumor volume, combined with chemotherapy sequentially. Method(s): Radiation doses to primary tumors were aligned along increasing tumor size within 4 groups (<2.5 cm/ 2.5-4.5 cm/ 4.5- 6.0 cm/ >6.0 cm; mean number of three perpendicular diameters). ICRU-doses of 73.8 Gy/ 79.2 Gy/ 84.6 Gy/ 90.0 Gy, respectively, were applied. Macroscopically involved nodes were treated with a median dose of 59.4 Gy, nodal sites about 6 cm cranial to involved nodes electively with 45 Gy. Fractional doses were 1.8 Gy twice daily (bid). 2 cycles chemotherapy were given before radiotherapy; the interval between chemotherapy and radiotherapy was prefe- rentially shorter than 8 days. With a median follow up time of 56.1 months (range 43.2 - 97.1 ) for patients alive, mature results for locoregional tumor control, survival and toxicity are presented. Result(s): Between 2004 and 2009,123 continuously referred, unselected patients with 127 histologically/ cytologically proven NSCLC were enrolled; Stage II: 6 pts.; IIIA: 70 pts.; IIIB: 47 pts. Weight loss >5%/ 3 months: 26%; Karnofsky Index <= 70%: 46% of the patients. The local tumor control rate at 2-/ 5 years is 73%/ 70%, respectively; the regional tumor control rate 91%/ 89%, respectively. The median overall survival time is 24.6 months, the 2- and 5-year overall survival rates are 52% and 19%, respectively. 2 treatment-related deaths (progressive pulmonary fibrosis) occurred in patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis. Further toxicity was mild or moderate: Pneumonitis grade 2/ 3 (n=10/ 6); esophagitis grade 2/ 3 (n=16/ 7). Lung late grade 2 (n=13), esophagus late grade 3 (n=1). Conclusion(s): Locoregional tumor control is high; as are survival times for this unselected patient cohort. In all outcome parameters DART-bid seems to compare favourably with simultaneous chemoradiotherapies, at present considered 'state of the art'; simultaneous treatments however are applicable only to a minority of referred patients, patients in good general condition.",Excluded
157,"Patterns of relapse in patients with high grade glioma receiving combined treatments including stereotactic re-irradiation for a first relapse PURPOSE: Bevacizumab and stereotactic treatment are efficient combined or alone in relapse glioma. However, patterns of relapse after this kind of salvage treatment have never been studied. The purpose of this unicentric retrospective analysis was to assess and understand the patterns of relapse of high grade glioma treated with stereotactic radiation, with or without bevacizumab.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with high grade glioma relapse received a stereotactic radiation; among them two patients received temozolomide and eight patients received bevacizumab; among the latter, four received also irinotecan. We matched the stereotactic radiation treatment planning scan with the images of the first treatment and of the second relapse in order to determine the patterns of failure and associate dosimetric profile.RESULTS: For the total population, median follow-up from the first diagnosis and relapse were 46.1 and 17.6 months, respectively. Among the 13 patients who relapsed, ten did not receive chemotherapy and three received it (P<0.05), two received temozolomide and one bevacizumab. Patients who received bevacizumab had no ""out-of-field"" recurrences. Among the 32 irradiated relapses, 15 were ""in-field"" recurrences; among them two were treated with bevacizumab and 13 were not (P<0.05). For the 32 lesions, a favourable prognostic factor of control was the association of a high-dose of irradiation and the use of bevacizumab.CONCLUSION: For patients with relapsed high grade glioma, local control was higher with combined bevacizumab and high-dose stereotactic radiation.",Excluded

The main exogenous sources of free radicals are among others: industrial pollution, tobacco smoke, ionizing radiation, ultrasound and magnetic field. The low frequency magnetic field is more and more applied in the physician therapy. The aim of our study was to prove, if the magnetically field applied in the magntetotherapy, affects generating the reactive forms of oxygen according to its working time.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research material made up male, adult, Sprague-Dawley race rats age 3-4 months. To investigation compounds reacting with the tiobarbituric acid, the blood was taken from the rat caudal vein into the test-glass including EDTA before being affected by the magnetic field. After the single exposition and after 14 days of being affected by the magnetic field, the concentration of the compounds reacting with the tiobarbituric acid in the serum was measured.RESULTS: After the single exposition to the changeable magnetic field (frequency 40 Hz, induction 7 mT, working time 30' and 60 min) the process of the peroxidation of lipids slowed down. A increase of the peroxidation of lipids was observed after 14 days and these changes are statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Low magnetic field used in magnetotherapy causes the changes of the generating the reactive forms of oxygen.",Excluded
1174,"Effects of acute dopamine depletion on the electrophysiological properties of striatal neurons The striatum, the main input nucleus of basal ganglia, receives a massive innervation from the entire cerebral cortex and is in charge of the detection of behaviorally relevant signals. In turn, via its projections to the output nuclei of basal ganglia, the striatum contributes to the organization of appropriate compartmental responses. Substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons project predominantly to the striatum and regulate striatal functions. Implications of dopaminergic receptors on the physiology of striatal neurons are now well documented. By contrast, the effects of acute dopamine depletion on striatal neurons remain poorly explored. Here, the alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine was used to deplete dopamine from rat brain slices. We analyzed the consequences of a alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine treatment on membrane properties of striatal neurons: the medium-sized spiny neurons and the interneurons (GABAergic, cholinergic and NO-synthase). After acute dopamine depletion, medium-sized spiny neurons became more excitable. GABAergic interneurons became less excitable whereas cholinergic cells displayed an increased excitability. NO-synthase-containing interneurons did not show noticeable changes in their excitability. Such membrane properties changes indicate that striatal circuits should undergo major alteration in cortico-basal ganglia information processing.",Excluded
1190,"Somastatin receptor (SSTR2) in canine meningioma: Preliminary results of immunohistochemical and qrt-PCR investigations The neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) plays an important regulatory role in the proliferation of both normal and neoplastic cells. Five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) have been identified in several human tumours, including meningioma. The receptor most commonly identified is the SSTR2a subtype. Long half-life somatostatin analogues (i.e. octreotide) are today included in chemotherapy schedules for unresectable or radiation-refractory recurrent human meningiomas. The aim of this study is to test the expression of SSTR2a in canine meningioma by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR analyses. Twenty-one FFPE meningiomas were used for IHC investigations performed with rabbit anti-human SSTR2 antibody (1:500, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. For each tumour, area of labeling was assessed in five grades, ranging from (-) = absent to (++++) = > 75% of tumour. Twenty-five meningiomas were also submitted to qRT-PCR investigations performed with Taqman probe (Life Technologies). Total RNA was extracted from 5 mum sections of FFPE tissue with FFPE-RNA Purification Kit (Norgen), and mRNA was reversetranscribed with iScript cDNA synthesis (Bio-rad). At IHC, SSTR2a was expressed in 17/21 cases (81%) showing a diffuse cytoplasmic immunoreaction. The most common histotypes, including meningothelial, fibroblastic, and transitional meningiomas as well as the papillary meningiomas were positive, ranging from (+) to (++++). Grade I, grade II and grade III expressed SSTR2 in 86%, 91%, and 33%, respectively. The PCR-amplification tests gave positive results in the majority of the canine meningiomas. These preliminary results encourage continuing this study aimed to find new chemotherapeutic protocols for dogs.",Excluded

The duplex retina of this elasmobranch contains rods and cones in a ratio of about 10:1. No multiple receptors were noted nor was a repeating or mosaic arrangement of the cones obvious. Only light-adapted specimens were studied but retinomotor movements of the photoreceptors were felt to be minimal or absent. The rods are large cylindrical cells with inner and outer segments of much the same diameter. Cones are short stout cells with a conical outer segment and a wider inner segment. Rod outer segment discs show peripheral incisures while cones do not. The inner segment of rods and cones are rich in organelles indicating much synthetic activity. The nuclei of rods and cones appear quite similar but cone nuclei are invariably at least partially protruded through the external limiting membrane which is formed by a series of zonulae adherentes between photoreceptor cells and Muller cells. The synaptic region of both rods and cones display both invaginated (ribbon) synapses and superficial (conventional) synapses.,Excluded

Many agents have been used for neuroprotection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible protective role of royal jelly on radiationinduced brain damage. Design(s): In the present study, thirty-two adult male Dawley rats, 8-12 weeks of age and weighing 275+/-35 grams were randomly divided into four groups each group compressed eight animals: group 1: control (C), group 2: irradiated rats (RT), group 3: irradiated rats with oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 days (RT+RJ50), group 4: oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 day (RJ50). Sprague Dawley rats were irradiated with 22 Gy gamma radiation delivered to total cranium. Royal jelly was administered before and after irradiation per day for 7 days. At the seventh day of study, when rats were under ketamine anesthesia samples of brain tissues were taken and biochemical and microscopic examination after sacrification. Result(s): An increase in brain tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations (P<0.001) were detected while significant decreases in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities (P<0.001) in irradiation alone group when compared to control group. Increases in MDA were relatively well prevented by royal jelly. The administration of RJ increased to activity of SOD and CAT enzymes and decreased MDA level in the brain tissue (p<0.001). On histopathological examination, royal jelly reduced edema, necrosis, vasodilation and neuronal degeneration. Conclusion(s): The results obtained from this study demonstrated that with royal jelly prevented the damage that develops in brain following irradiation. The beneficial effect of royal jelly can be related to protection of the brain from oxidative injury.",Included

191,"Differential target dependence in the developing brain: implications for mental retardation During development of the brain, many neurons exhibit a dependence on other neuronal populations for their survival and differentiation (target dependence). Evidence suggests that some neural pathways are much more dependent on single target neuronal populations for their survival than are others (differential target dependence). This phenomenon has important implications both for animal models of congenital human brain damage and for ideas concerning the aetiology of behavioural abnormalities associated with human mental retardation. Predictions of the neuronal deficits likely to arise from exposure to cytotoxic agents (e.g. ionizing radiation, hyperthermia, viral infection) at a particular time must take differential target dependence into account. It is known that target dependence affects corticopetal pathways involved with the discriminative senses (e.g. vision), more than monoaminergic and cholinergic corticopetal pathways which are believed to be involved with arousal, selective sensory attention, sleep, memory and cortical vasomotor function. Following prenatal damage to superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, this effect of differential target dependence leads not only to a relative hyperinnervation of the cortex with monoaminergic and cholinergic projections, but a specific deficit in visual pathways. The implications of this combined deficit for the behaviour and rehabilitation of the mentally retarded are considered.",Excluded
955,"Personalised support of brain tumour patients during radiotherapy based on psychological profile and quality of life PURPOSE: Psychological distress in primary malignant brain tumour (PMBT) patients is associated with poorer outcomes. Radiotherapy (RT) often induces side effects that significantly influence patients' quality of life (QoL), with potential impact on survival. We evaluated distress, anxiety, depression, and QoL over time to identify patients with difficulties in these areas who required more intense psychological support.METHODS: Psychological questionnaires-Distress Thermometer (DT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G and FACT-Br)-were completed at the beginning (T0), in the middle (T1), directly after RT (T2), and 3 months after RT (T3). We personalised the psychological support provided for each patient with a minimum of three sessions ('typical' schedule) and a maximum of eight sessions ('intensive' schedule), depending on the patients' psychological profiles, clinical evaluations, and requests. Patients' survival was evaluated in the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, with an explorative intent.RESULTS: Fifty-nine consecutive PMBT patients receiving post-operative RT were included. For patients who were reported as 'not distressed' at T0, no statistically significant changes were noted. In contrast, patients who were 'distressed' at T0 showed statistically significant improvements in DT, HADS, FACT-G, and FACT-Br scores over time. 'Not distressed' patients required less psychological sessions over the study duration than 'distressed' patients. Interestingly, 'not distressed' GBM patients survived longer than 'distressed' GBM patients.CONCLUSIONS: Increased psychological support improved distress, mood, and QoL for patients identified as 'distressed', whereas psychological well-being was maintained with typical psychological support in patients who were identified as being 'not distressed'. These results encourage a standardisation of psychological support for all RT patients.",Excluded
99,"Lower stimulation frequency can enhance tolerability and efficacy of pallidal deep brain stimulation for dystonia We report the case of a patient with medically refractory primary dystonia who was treated with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation. Stimulation at 130 Hz or higher, by means of the more ventral contacts generated capsular side effects, which made their use impractical. Consequently, the patient was treated for 9 months at 130 to 185 Hz, by means of the more dorsal contacts, achieving modest results. By reducing the stimulation frequency to 80 Hz, we were able to activate the ventral contacts without inducing side effects. Within days, the patient experienced a dramatic improvement in function that has persisted for 1 year. A further reduction in stimulation frequency to 60 Hz resulted in a worsening of his symptoms. We conclude that chronic stimulation at frequencies of <100 Hz may be efficacious in dystonia and may enhance the tolerability of stimulation by means of contacts that are positioned posteroventrally within the internal globus pallidus, nearer the internal capsule.",Excluded

92,"High-dose ascorbate enhances chemo-radio-sensitization in GBM Purpose/Objective(s): Ascorbate is a water soluble vitamin that has been previously shown at milli-molar concentrations to be selectively toxic to a variety of cancer cells, including high grade gliomas, while being innocuous to normal cells. In addition, in vivo experiments with human xenografts and human clinical trials with pancreas cancer demonstrated that high plasma concentrations of ascorbate (~20 mM) are well tolerated. Since ascorbate crosses the blood brain barrier, we hypothesized that high dose ascorbate would enhance chemo-radio-sensitization in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Materials/Methods: In order to determine if high dose ascorbate enhances GBM chemo-radio-sensitization, U87 and UI-581 human GBM cells were grown in vitro for 24 hrs and then exposed to 0.5 mM ascorbate and/or temozolomide 100 mmol/L for 1 hr followed by 2 Gy of concurrent irradiation. In the xenograft studies, U87 GBM cells were grown in the flanks of nude mice and treated with ascorbate (4 mg/kg; IP), and/or ionizing radiation (6 Gy x 2 fractions 48hrs apart) for 2 weeks. Tumor growth rates were assessed daily with calipers. Result(s): Both U87 and UI 581 cell lines demonstrated that ascorbate has an additive effect on radiation+temozolomide-induced cell killing in clonogenic cell survival analysis (p<0.05). In addition, ascorbate toxicity was completely inhibited (p<0.05) with the addition of catalase confirming that ascorbate toxicity is mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Mice with U87 GBM xenograft tumors treated with ascorbate and radiation demonstrated a significantly slower tumor growth rate compared to mice receiving radiation alone (p=0.031). Median survival in mice treated with radiation alone was 21 days while mice treated with ascorbate plus radiation was 28 days (p = 0.034).

A level of tool penetration force during cutting of bones has been the prime concern to surgeons, since it can produce unnecessary mechanical damage to surrounding tissues. Research in this area has been undertaken for many decades to find ways to minimise the cutting force. Cutting of bone with ultrasonic tools is a relatively new technique replacing conventional procedures in neuro-, dental and orthopaedic surgeries, due to its precision and safety. In this article, the level of forces produced during a chisel-like tool penetration in a fresh cortical bone is studied. The obtained force data are analysed for both conventional cutting and ultrasonically assisted cutting. Through a series of experiments, it was demonstrated that the depth of cut and parameters of ultrasonic oscillations affected the level of cutting force, the former being the main factor in both types of cutting. It was found that the tool penetration force was decreased with an increase in the ultrasonic frequency or amplitude and was not affected by the cutting speed. The rise in bone temperature was measured and was found to be insensitive to the level of cutting speed within the range used in this study.",Excluded

The current study sought to describe healthcare providers' (HCPs) decisions to treat with ceritinib and to describe patientreported side effects, perceived effectiveness and attitudes toward ceritinib. Method(s): One-on-one telephone interviews were conducted with HCPs caring for patients treated with ceritinib using a semi-structured interview guide designed to explore treatment decision-making, adverse events (AEs) and their management. Patients with current or past experience of ceritinib completed semi-structured telephone interviews designed to capture their experience. A thematic analysis of interview transcripts was conducted using qualitative analysis software, MaxQDA. Result(s): Study participants comprised 10 HCPs (6 oncologists, 4 nurses) and 18 patients (9 female) aged 34-78 years (mean=51.0; SD=11.3). HCPs reported relying on two main factors when deciding to switch patients to ceritinib or to next-line treatment after ceritinib: evidence of sufficient clear-cut progression and poor tolerance to treatment. Four HCPs reported considering clinical trials or other newly approved drugs instead of ceritinib. Patients and HCPs concurred that the most frequently reported side effects of ceritinib include diarrhea (n=15 patients; n=9 HCPs), nausea (n=13; n=10), vomiting (n=12; n=6), and abdominal pain (n=10; n=7). Dose reduction, antiemetic and anti-diarrheal medications, and home remedies (e.g. ginger ale, crackers) were reported as being effective at managing these side effects prophylactically or once they occurred. Taking ceritinib with food was reported by 5 patients and 4 HCPs, and helped to improve nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. Patients reported that ceritinib was effective in achieving or maintaining symptom control for cough (n=12 of 12 patients symptomatic at diagnosis) and shortness of breath (n=9 of 11 patients symptomatic at diagnosis). Of 14 patients with lung tumors at start of ceritinib, 13 reported positive tumor response during treatment. Three of 7 patients with brain metastases achieved reduction or no evidence of disease with ceritinib in combination with other interventions (e.g., radiation). Patients were asked what they liked about ceritinib: tumor response and symptom control, an extension of life, or improvement in quality of life were key themes. Patient-reported dislikes included side effects and number of pills. Of 14 patients asked specifically, all stated the benefits of ceritinib outweigh its side effects.

We have examined material from normal individuals, from ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients and from A-T heterozygotes. We have confirmed the greater sensitivity of A-T derived cells to gamma radiation. The distinction between A-T and normal cells is maintained in cells immortalized by SV40 virus but the immortal cells are more gamma radiation resistant than the corresponding primary fibroblasts. Cells transformed by plasmids (pSV3gpt and pSV3neo) expressing SV40 T-antigen, both pre- and post-crisis, show this increased resistance, indicating that it is expression of SV40 T-antigen, rather than immortalization per se which is responsible for the change.

Though the tDCS electrode montage often follows basic rules of thumb (increased/decreased excitability ""under"" the anode/cathode electrode), computational forward models of brain current flow provide more accurate insight into detailed current flow patterns and, in some cases, can even challenge simplified electrode-placement assumptions. With the increased recognized value of computational forward models in informing tDCS montage design and interpretation of results, there have been recent advances in modeling tools and a greater proliferation of publications. In addition, the importance of customizing tDCS for potentially vulnerable populations (eg, skull defects, brain damage/stroke, and extremes of age) can be considered. Finally, computational models can be used to design new electrode montages, for example, to improve spatial targeting such as high-definition tDCS. Pending further validation and dissemination of modeling tools, computational forward models of neuromodulation will become standard tools to guide the optimization of clinical trials and electrotherapy.",Excluded
825,"Amifostine: an update on its clinical status as a cytoprotectant in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy and its potential therapeutic application in myelodysplastic syndrome UNLABELLED: Amifostine (WR-2721) is a cytoprotective agent that protects a broad range of normal tissues from the toxic effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy without attenuating tumour response. This selective protection is due to the greater conversion and uptake of the active metabolite, WR- 1065, in normal versus neoplastic tissues. In a pivotal phase III trial, 242 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were randomised to receive treatment with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with or without pretreatment with intravenous amifostine 910 mg/m2. Over 6 cycles of therapy, amifostine significantly reduced haematological, renal and neurological toxicities: treatment delays, treatment discontinuation and days in hospital related to these adverse events were also significantly reduced in patients receiving amifostine versus patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In another randomised phase III trial in 303 patients with head and neck cancer undergoing irradiation therapy (total dose 50 to 70Gy), pretreatment with intravenous amifostine 200 mg/m2 significantly reduced the incidence of acute and late grade > or =2 xerostomia. However, mucositis was not significantly reduced in amifostine recipients compared with patients receiving radiotherapy alone, although this has been shown in smaller randomised trials. Amifostine (340 mg/m2) also provided significant protection against pneumonitis and oesophagitis in patients with lung cancer receiving thoracic irradiation in a preliminary report from a phase III trial (n = 144). Other studies have demonstrated protective effects of amifostine in other tumour types and other chemotherapy, radiation and radiochemotherapy regimens; however, evidence is still limited in these indications. No evidence of tumour protection by amifostine has been demonstrated in any clinical trials. Amifostine has also been shown to stimulate haematopoietic stem cells and has been investigated as a therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in number of small preliminary studies. At the recommended dose and schedule, amifostine is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are usually reversible and manageable and those most frequently experienced include nausea and vomiting, transient hypotension and somnolence and sneezing.CONCLUSION: The results of phase III trials have confirmed the safety and efficacy of amifostine as a cytoprotectant to ameliorate cisplatin-induced cumulative renal toxicity, for which it is the only agent proven to be effective, and neutropenia in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, and to reduce xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer receiving irradiation therapy. Depending on the outcome of numerous ongoing clinical trials, amifostine may eventually find broader clinical applications, both as a cytoprotectant and as a potential therapy in myelodysplastic syndrome.

343,"TrpC3/C7 and Slo2.1 are molecular targets for metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling in rat striatal cholinergic interneurons Large aspiny cholinergic interneurons provide the sole source of striatal acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter critical for basal ganglia function; these tonically active interneurons receive excitatory inputs from corticostriatal glutamatergic afferents that act, in part, via metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). We combined electrophysiological recordings in brain slices with molecular neuroanatomy to identify distinct ion channel targets for mGluR1/5 receptors in striatal cholinergic interneurons: transient receptor potential channel 3/7 (TrpC3/C7) and Slo2.1. In recordings obtained with methanesulfonate-based internal solutions, we found an mGluR-activated current with voltage-dependent and pharmacological properties reminiscent of TrpC3 and TrpC7; expression of these TrpC subunits in cholinergic interneurons was verified by combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, and modulation of both TrpC channels was reconstituted in HEK293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells cotransfected with mGluR1 or mGluR5. With a chloride-based internal solution, mGluR agonists did not activate interneuron TrpC-like currents. Instead, a time-dependent, outwardly rectifying K(+) current developed after whole-cell access, and this Cl(-)-activated K(+) current was strongly inhibited by volatile anesthetics and mGluR activation. This modulation was recapitulated in cells transfected with Slo2.1, a Na(+)- and Cl(-)-activated K(+) channel, and Slo2.1 expression was confirmed histochemically in striatal cholinergic interneurons. By using gramicidin perforated-patch recordings, we established that the predominant agonist-activated current was TrpC-like when ambient intracellular chloride was preserved, although a small K(+) current contribution was observed in some cells. Together, our data indicate that mGluR1/5-mediated glutamatergic excitation of cholinergic interneurons is primarily a result of activation of TrpC3/TrpC7-like cationic channels; under conditions when intracellular NaCl is elevated, a Slo2.1 background K(+) channel may also contribute.",Excluded

The gathered data will help to evaluate whether hygiene standards that limit maximum admissible EMF values (e.g., ICNIRP standards) protect against adverse effects of exposure. The study covered workers employed in transformer and distribution stations, medium wave transmitting stations, radio-service and radio and TV multichannel broadcasting stations. In all the cases, exposure levels were considerably lower than those set as admissible according to the ICNIRP standards. Nevertheless changes in the circulatory system and a significant relationship between blood pressure and neurovegetative regulation disorders and exposure parameters were observed. The frequency of changes in the circulatory system was significantly dependent not only on the maximum EMF value, but also on its dose, which indicates that the hygiene standards for EMF cannot be limited only to short-term exposure maximum values, but they should be supplemented with dose-related standards.",Excluded

Each peptide gave a specific response to irradiation. The plasma levels of GRP and substance P were not modified by irradiation exposure; neither were those of motilin and PYY. Concerning gastrin, a 2-3-fold increase of plasma concentration was observed in pig, which presented the most important histological alterations of the stomach. The plasma levels of somatostatin, unchanged from 1 to 4 days after irradiation, was also increased by 130% at 5 days. In contrast, a diminution of neurotensin plasma levels was noted, firstly at 1 day (-88%), and from 3 days after exposure (-50%). The present study suggested that changes in gastrin and neurotensin plasma levels were associated with structural alterations of the stomach and ileum, respectively, indicating that they may be relevant biological indicators of radiation-induced digestive damage to these segments.",Included

681,"Endogenous ATP involvement in mustard-oil-induced central sensitization in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (medullary dorsal horn) Central sensitization represents a sustained hypersensitive state of dorsal horn nociceptive neurons that can be evoked by peripheral inflammation or injury to nerves and tissues. It reflects neuroplastic changes such as increases in neuronal spontaneous activity, receptive field size, and responses to suprathreshold stimuli and a decrease in activation threshold. We recently demonstrated that purinergic receptor mechanisms in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc; medullary dorsal horn) are also involved in the initiation and maintenance of central sensitization in brain stem nociceptive neurons of trigeminal subnucleus oralis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether endogenous ATP is involved in the development of central sensitization in Vc itself. The experiments were carried out on urethan/alpha-chloralose anesthetized and immobilized rats. Single neurons were recorded and identified as nociceptive-specific (NS) in the deep laminae of Vc. During continuous saline superfusion (0.6 ml/h it) over the caudal medulla, Vc neuronal central sensitization was readily induced by mustard oil application to the tooth pulp. However, this mustard-oil-induced central sensitization could be completely blocked by continuous intrathecal superfusion of the wide-spectrum P2X receptor antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2, 4-disulphonic acid tetra-sodium (33-100 microM) and by apyrase (an ectonucleotidase enzyme, 30 units/ml). Superfusion of the selective P2X1, P2X3 and P2X(2/3) receptor antagonist 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (6-638 microM) partially blocked the Vc central sensitization. The two P2X receptor antagonists did not significantly affect the baseline nociceptive properties of the Vc neurons. These findings implicate endogenous ATP as an important mediator contributing to the development of central sensitization in nociceptive neurons of the deep laminae of the dorsal horn.",Excluded
373,"Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) improves learning after radiation stress Brain is highly susceptible to oxidative damage due to its high utilization of oxygen and rather poorly developed antioxidative defense mechanism. Free radicals formation is greatly augmented during ionizing radiation exposure, which causes damage in cerebellum responsible for locomotor activity. Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) having high content of beta-carotene (about 15 mg/100g), ascorbic acid, Vitamin C and folate, may prove efficient antioxidants. To evaluate its antioxidative efficacy, healthy Swiss albino mice from an inbred colony were selected and divided into three groups having equal number of male and female in each group. All of these animals were initially trained in Hebb William's Maze, model D(1). After initial training of 10 days, two groups were supplemented with methanolic extract of A. paniculatus (Linn.) at a dose of 600 and 800 mg/kg bw per day, respectively for 15 days. One group without any treatment served as normal. It has been observed that mice, supplemented with extract took lesser time to reach goal than normal (without any treatment). Furthermore after supplementation of Amaranthus, followed by exposure to 9 Gy of gamma radiation by 60Co beam therapy unit, the survived mice took lesser time to reach to their goals than those without plant extract. Control mice (not supplemented with AE extract) showed continuous decline in their learning performance. Mice of Control group died within 12 days after exposure. Irradiated males try to recover from 10th day onwards but they died up to day 12. But in Experimental mice (AE treated), after initial decline in learning ability after exposure, recovery was noticed and not only this 70% of them survived beyond the observation period. Besides male mice showed faster learning ability as compared to females in all groups. After irradiation too, males took lesser time to reach to goals. Learning in all the groups before exposure has been much faster in between 9 and 15 days. After radiation, however it was followed by a sudden spurt and delayed learning response up to 12 days. Recovery was greater in males than females in treated groups. Recovery was greater in males of 600 mg/kg bw per day than other groups. Learning has been almost at the same level from 14th day onward, which indicates that both the dose levels have been found equally effective.",Included
111,"Left fronto-temporal lobe dementia caused by gamma knife surgery in an elderly woman Introduction: Dementing processes in the geriatric population are devastating and can result in early death and increased care giver burden. FTD has the core features of earlier decline and impairment in regulation of social interpersonal conduct.We describe a case of an elderly female who was found to have features of FTD which had directly resulted from gamma knife surgery. This is the first described case of left FTD secondary to gamma knife radiation to our knowledge. Case: The patient is a 76 year old African American female, otherwise healthy and on no any medications with a history of a left frontotemporal arteriovenous malformation. She underwent gamma knife radiation treatment resulting in radiation necrosis eight years prior to presentation. She presented to the clinic escorted by her daughter who observed personality changes in the patient including becoming argumentative, uncooperative, and increasingly hyper religious, with increased interpersonal conflicts surrounding patient's inability to follow-through on plans. The patient only admitted to trouble with memory. Patient was observed to have disinhibition and inappropriateness during the group interview. Geriatric Depression Scale was negative for depression. Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 15/30 with deficits including: recall 0/5, language (1/3 naming, 0/2 repetition, 0/1 fluency with only 3 F words), calculation 0/3; while attention and orientations were intact. Patient was unable to perform Trail-making test, Part B. Otherwise, she appeared robust, independent in ADL but needing some assistance with IADL. Given her behavioral changes including tactlessness and poor social judgment, executive dysfunction, memory impairment and language deficits in the context of prior left frontal lobe radiation injury, she was given the diagnosis of left predominant FTD. Conclusion(s): Isolated and localized brain anomalies and their treatment are the rare causes of brain dysfunctions. In this unfortunate case, our patient's FTD is a direct result of her iatrogenic radiation necrosis. Appropriate diagnosis of this patient's condition via correlation of her cognitive deficit with radiographic findings allowed for appropriate counseling of both the patient and family in regards to the permanent nature of her condition. This in turn resulted in acceptance of her condition by her family, establishing prognosis and helping to facilitate her long term care plan.",Excluded
1152,"Clival chordomas: A pathological, surgical, and radiotherapeutic review Background. The purpose of this study was to discuss the optimal management of patients with clival chordomas and provide an up-to-date review of the field. Methods. A schematic description of the anatomy of the clivus and its surrounding structures is provided based on the modular classification of the surgical corridors used in endoscopic skull base surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) techniques are described. Results. The optimal treatment is gross total resection. Recent advances in endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery have allowed very high rates of macroscopic and radiographic complete tumor resection in spite of the challenging location of these lesions. When the tumor location or extension is too lateral or inferior to be effectively resected with an endoscopic approach, an open approach or a combination of endoscopic and open approaches in stages should be considered. Postoperative RT is usually indicated because the likelihood of recurrence is high in spite of complete surgical resection. The main site of recurrence is local and late recurrences are relatively common. The probability of cure is approximately 50% at 10 years and significantly increases when complete tumor resection has been achieved. Conclusion. The preferred treatment for patients with clival chordoma is gross total resection (via endoscopic endonasal surgery when possible) followed by postoperative RT. Treatment at experienced multidisciplinary cranial base centers is key to minimize complications and to enhance the probability of total removal of the tumors. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
837,"Characterization of unit activity recorded from septum, thalamus, and caudate following incremental opiate treatment The effects of a wide range of morphine doses and of its antagonist, naloxone, on spontaneous multiunit discharges in freely moving rats were recorded simultaneously from the septum (Spt), medial thalamus (CM-PF complex), and caudate nucleus (CN). A high percentage of neurons in these three areas are affected by morphine. Neurons in the CM-PF complex exhibited a greater number of morphine-induced changes (104/145) than did those in the caudate nucleus (79/160), or in the septum (67/150). The morphine-induced changes exhibited dose-related patterns: the three structures examined in the present study exhibited four response patterns to incremental doses of morphine: either a monophasic effect, an increase or decrease in firing rate, or a biphasic effect; ie, lower morphine doses induced a decrease in activity, whereas higher doses induced an increase in firing rate. There was no observed correlation between the response patterns in the three regions. The technique provides a tool with which to identify and classify the specific response patterns induced by morphine in specific brain regions, and the results may indicate that each region plays a different physiological role in the effects induced by morphine.",Excluded

483,"Low (20 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle radiation lead to a persistent reduction in the spatial learning ability of rats Exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is considered to be a potential health risk in long-term space travel, and it represents a significant risk to the central nervous system (CNS). The most harmful component of GCR is the HZE [high-mass, highly charged (Z), high-energy] particles, e.g. <sup>56</sup>Fe. In previous ground-based experiments, exposure to high doses of HZE-particle radiation induced pronounced deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rodents. Recent data suggest that glutamatergic transmission in hippocampal synaptosomes is impaired after low (60 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles, which could lead to impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. To assess the effects of mission-relevant (2060 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles on hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, male Wistar rats either received sham treatment or were irradiated and tested 3 months later in the Barnes maze test. Compared to the controls, rats that received 20, 40 and 60 cGy 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles showed significant impairments in their ability to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze, which was manifested by progressively increasing escape latency times over the 3 days of testing. However, this increase was not due to a lack of motivation of the rats to escape, because the total number of head pokes (and especially incorrect head pokes) remained constant over the test period. Given that rats exposed to X rays did not exhibit spatial memory impairments until >10 Gy was delivered, the RBE for 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle-induced hippocampal spatial memory impairment is ~50. These data demonstrate that mission-relevant doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles can result in severe deficits in hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive tasks, and the extreme sensitivity of these processes to 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles must arise due to the perturbation of multiple processes in addition to killing neuronal cells. © 2012 by Radiation Research Society.

Under high magnification, we observed robust staining for the neurohormone oxytocin and the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin associated with cilia extending into the third ventricle from the surrounding ventricular wall; no similar staining was observed for vasopressin or calbindin. Retinal illumination had opposite effects on levels of parvalbumin and oxytocin in the cilia: light exposure during late subjective night increased oxytocin staining, but decreased parvalbumin staining in the cilia. Preventing cellular transport with colchicine eliminated immunohistochemical staining for oxytocin in the cilia. There was also a significant daily rhythm of oxytocin immunostaining in the third ventricle wall, and in magnocellular neurons in the anterior hypothalamus.

Material(s) and Method(s): To evaluate the impact of PCI on survival we reviewed 179 LD SCLC patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the concurrent or sequential setting. PCI was applied in the partial and complete responders exclusively provided contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) before and after primary treatment showed no signs of occult BMs. Correlation between PCI and time to progression (TTP) as well as overall survival (OS) was analysed. Kaplan-Meier analysis, uni- and multivariate Cox regression were used to describe survival within subgroups defined by treatment response and application of PCI. Result(s): Concurrent and sequential chemoradiotherapy CRT was applied in 71 (40%) and 108 (60%) patients, respectively. In 58 (32%) patients metachronous BMs were detected.

The highest absorbed radiation doses were to the heart (10.5 mGy/kBq) and kidney (9.19 mGy/kBq), making these the critical organs for [<sup>11</sup>C]NMB. A heart absorption of 50 mGy would result from an injected dose of 4,762 MBq [<sup>11</sup>C]NMB.

PET tracers are needed for imaging of this receptor system in vivo. Method(s): High-specific-activity <sup>11</sup>C-ORM-13070 (1-[(S)-1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl]-4-(3-<sup>11</sup>C-methoxy- methylpyridin-2-yl)-piperazine) was synthesized by <sup>11</sup>C-methylation of O-desmethyl-ORM-13070 with <sup>11</sup>C-methyl triflate, which was prepared from cyclotron-produced <sup>11</sup>C-methane via <sup>11</sup>C-methyl iodide. Rats and mice were investigated in vivo with PET and ex vivo with autoradiography. The specificity of <sup>11</sup>C-ORM-13070 binding to alpha<inf>2</inf> adrenoceptors was demonstrated in rats pretreated with atipamezole, an alpha<inf>2</inf> adrenoceptor antagonist. The alpha<inf>2C</inf> adrenoceptor selectivity of the tracer was determined by comparing tracer binding in wild-type and alpha<inf>2A</inf>- and alpha<inf>2AC</inf> adrenoceptor knockout (KO) mice. <sup>11</sup>C-ORM-13070 and its radioactive metabolites in rat plasma and brain tissue were analyzed with radio-high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Human radiation dose estimates were extrapolated from rat biodistribution data. Result(s): The radiochemical yield, calculated from initial cyclotron-produced <sup>11</sup>C-methane, was 9.6% +/- 2.7% (decay-corrected to end of bombardment). The specific activity of the product was 640 +/- 390 GBq/mumol (decay-corrected to end of synthesis). The radiochemical purity exceeded 99% in all syntheses. The highest levels of tracer binding were observed in the striatum and olfactory tubercle of rats and control and alpha<inf>2A</inf> KO mice - that is, in the brain regions known to contain the highest densities of alpha<inf>2C</inf> adrenoceptors. In rats pretreated with atipamezole and in alpha<inf>2AC</inf> KO mice, <sup>11</sup>C tracer binding in the striatum and olfactory tubercle was low, similar to that of the frontal cortex and thalamus, regions with low densities of alpha<inf>2C</inf> adrenoceptors.

118,"The physical basis of neuroimaging techniques During the past 20 years, the technology of neuroimaging has improved on all fronts. Coupled with increased human ingenuity and the greater power of digital computers, modern imaging methods are capable of providing precise measurements of brain structure and sensitive assessments of brain function. The complementary nature of different techniques adds to their value, whereas the rivalry between modalities continues to catalyze the pace of technical advances. Although there may appear to be choices to be made as to which technique should be used for certain purposes, in many instances there are clear advantages and reasons to select a particular method. Some of these advantages were mentioned in this article, but here we summarize some of the relevant issues. Nuclear medicine techniques have almost no role in anatomic imaging because they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot hi general distinguish many types of tissues to permit structural analysis. Although CT provides excellent images of the skull, sulci, and ventricles, and is capable of providing volumetric and dynamic images with recent advances such as spiral scanning, it is unlikely in the future to challenge MR imaging for structural studies. CT exposes the patient to ionizing radiation and at acceptable doses cannot provide the soft-tissue differentiation needed for must structural studies. MR imaging systems based on magnets of moderate to high field strength provide images with contrast and spatial resolution superior to those of any other imaging method. In the foreseeable future, there appears to be no other imaging technique capable of providing the quality of anatomic information rendered by MR imaging. Furthermore, it is clear that continuing advances in MR imaging technology, such as the development of new magnets and improved RF coils, will lead to further improvements in image quality beyond that obtainable today, most likely at lower costs than previous systems. In addition, the development of higher field strength systems (operating at 3-5 T) will provide information at a spatial scale not previously available except in specialized animal imaging systems, so that in vivo resolution of 100 mum will be possible in many centers. One primary challenge will be to develop computer image analysis techniques capable of handling the wealth of anatomic detail provided by MR imaging in reasonable times and at reasonable cost. Functional methods will continue to evolve. Functional MR imaging is less than 4 years old but has already progressed to the point where it can provide data in some studies to rival the best available by other means. Questions regarding the superiority of functional MR imaging or PET, however, cannot be conclusively addressed now, and in fact may not be sensible; both will remain important for the next several years. There are realistic expectations that functional MR imaging will yield semi-quantitative measures of flow and oxygenation in individual subjects in a large number of cognitive and other tasks, and using functional MR imaging we should learn a great deal about the distribution and connectedness of neural systems involved with different functions. The major challenges will be in designing interpretable studies that lend themselves to the functional MR imaging format and in improving the reliability of the functional MR imaging data. Higher field magnets, providing images with higher SNR as well as being more sensitive to microscopic susceptibility effects, should increase the sensitivity of functional MR imaging. The ability to perform multiple repeated studies on individuals and its intrinsic safety, coupled with its high spatial resolution, assures it of an evolving role in the study of brain activation. PET will also continue to be used for many such activation studies. PET facilities uniquely can perform studies of organic disorders such as tumors, receptor systems, and metabolism. PET enjoys high sensitivity to activation and, in the right hands, can provide absolute quantification of flow changes as wel as resting flow, a task currently beyond functional MR imaging BOLD methods. Some improvements in spatial resolution and sensitivity can be expected from different detector systems.",Excluded
957,"Hemorrhage of cerebral arteriovenous malformations significantly alters stereotactic radiosurgery outcomes Introduction: Intracranial hemorrhage is simultaneously the most frequent and most debilitating manifestation of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM), but its impact on success and complications of radiosurgery has not been rigorously assessed. In this case-control study, we define the effect of prior hemorrhage on AVM radiosurgery outcomes. Method(s): From a prospective, institutional database of 1400 AVM patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, unruptured and ruptured AVMs were matched in a 1:1 fashion, blinded to outcome, based on patient demographics, prior embolization, AVM size (mean volume of unruptured AVMs 3.7 cm3 versus ruptured AVMs 3.5 cm3, P=0.195), Spetzler-Martin grade and radiosurgical treatment parameters (mean prescription dose for unruptured AVMs 20.9 Gy versus ruptured AVMs 21.0 Gy, P=0.837). There were 270 patients in each cohort. Matched statistical analyses were used to compare the baseline characteristics, obliteration rates, post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage risks, and incidences of radiation-induced changes (RIC) between the two cohorts. Result(s): The actuarial obliteration rates of the two cohorts were similar (unruptured AVMs: 38%, 58%, 76% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 40%, 60%, 73% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.592). However, for embolized AVMs, complete obliteration was more likely to be achieved in unruptured lesions (unruptured AVMs: 25%, 32%, 54% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 18%, 27%, 42% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.038). Prior AVM rupture resulted in a higher annual risk of post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage (ruptured AVMs 2.3% versus unruptured AVMs 1.1%, P=0.025) but a lower rate of cumulative and symptomatic RIC (cumulative RIC: ruptured AVMs 30.4% versus unruptured AVMs 48.9%, P<0.0001; symptomatic RIC: ruptured AVMs 7.0% versus unruptured AVMs 12.2%, P=0.041, respectively). The rates of permanent RIC were similar between the unruptured (2.2%) and ruptured (1.9%) AVM cohorts (P=0.761). Conclusion(s): Prior AVM rupture significantly alters the risk of latency period hemorrhage and RIC following radiosurgery. These effects should be taken into consideration with the multidisciplinary management of AVM patients.",Excluded

This may be used to quantify the high-affinity state of 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptors and may have the potential to quantify changes in cerebral 5-HT levels in vivo. We here investigated safety aspects related to clinical use of [<sup>11</sup>C]Cimbi-36, including radiation dosimetry and in vivo pharmacology. Procedures: [<sup>11</sup>C]Cimbi-36 was injected in rats or pigs, and radiation dosimetry was examined by ex vivo dissection or with PET scanning, respectively. Based on animal data, the Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment software was used to estimate extrapolated human dosimetry for [<sup>11</sup>C]Cimbi-36. The 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptor agonist actions of [<sup>11</sup>C]Cimbi-36 in vivo pharmacological effects in mice elicited by increasing doses of Cimbi-36 were assessed with the head-twitch response (HTR). Result(s): The effective dose as extrapolated from both rat and pig data was low, 7.67 and 4.88 muSv/MBq, respectively. In addition, the estimated absorbed radiation dose to human target organs did not exceed safety levels. Administration of 0.5 mg/kg Cimbi-36 leads to significant HTR compared to saline, whereas 0.05 mg/kg Cimbi-36 (doses much larger than those given in conjunction with a PET scan) did not elicit a significant HTR.

However, the biological effects due to exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) produced by mobile phones are largely unknown. Environmental and occupational exposure of humans to gamma-rays is a biologically relevant phenomenon. Consequently studies were undertaken to examine the interactions between gamma-rays and EMF on human health. In this study, exposure to 900-MHz EMF expanded gamma-ray damage to SHG44 cells. Preexposure EMF enhanced the decrease in cell proliferation induced by gamma-ray irradiation and the rate of apoptosis. The combination of EMF and gamma-ray exposure resulted in a synergistic effect by triggering stress response, which increased reactive oxygen species, but the expression of hsp70 at both mRNA and protein levels remained unaltered.

1186,"TCR VB clonal expansion predicts response to adoptive immunotherapy against medulloblastoma BACKGROUD: Adoptive cell therapy has led to robust overall response rates in patients with metastatic disease. In patients with durable responses after adoptive immunotherapy, sequencing of TCR Vbeta demonstrated multiple T cell clonotypes in the adoptively transferred cells, but showed clonotypic expansion of only a select few over time and these clones persisted in peripheral blood for one or more months after transfer. The identification of antigens associated with brain tumor rejection mediated by adoptive cell therapy remains challenging given the diversity of the bulk lymphocyte populations. We have previously demonstrated that adoptive cell therapy employing ex vivo activated tumor-specific T cells using tumor-RNA pulsed dendritic cells (TTRNA-T cells) is highly efficacious against preclinical models of brain tumors refractory to radiation and chemotherapy. Without prior knowledge of the tumor antigen targeted in our adoptive cell therapy platform, we developed a novel method to identify tumor-specific T lymphocytes from the bulk of ex vivo activated TTRNA-T cells by evaluating the TCR Vbeta repertoire using flow cytometry based spectratyping. In this study we demonstrate that TCR Vbeta expression can be used to both identify and enrich for the tumor-specific T cells from a bulk population. RESULT(S): In a murine model of Group 3 medulloblastoma (referred to as NSC) treated with adoptive cell therapy, TCR Vbeta spectratyping revealed expansion of TCR Vbeta families 5.1/5.2, 6, 8.1/8.2, and 13 in responders to therapy. Functionality assays demonstrate that these TCR Vbeta families are responsible for anti-tumor reactivity against NSC medulloblastoma cells. Survival and responsiveness to immunotherapy is strongly associated with expansion of TTRNA-T cells that express TCR Vbeta 8.1/8.2. These findings were corroborated in a patient with recurrent medulloblastoma who received adoptive cell therapy using autologous TTRNA-T cells. Clonal expansion of adoptively transferred tumor-reactive T cells was revealed using TCR sequencing.",Excluded

In spite of these difficulties, it is appropriate to carry out a pooled analysis of all available comet assay biomonitoring data, in order to establish baseline parameters of DNA damage, and to investigate associations between comet assay measurements and factors such as sex, age, smoking status, nutrition, lifestyle, etc. With this as its major objective, the ComNet project has recruited almost 100 research groups willing to share datasets. Here we provide a background to this project, discussing the history of the comet assay and practical issues that can critically affect its performance. We survey its diverse applications in biomonitoring studies, including environmental and occupational exposure to genotoxic agents, genoprotection by dietary and other factors, DNA damage associated with various diseases, and intrinsic factors that affect DNA damage levels in humans.

305,"Patient-Specific Screening Using High-Grade Glioma Explants to Determine Potential Radiosensitization by a TGF-beta Small Molecule Inhibitor High-grade glioma (HGG), a deadly primary brain malignancy, manifests radioresistance mediated by cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental mechanisms. High levels of the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in HGG promote radioresistance by enforcing an effective DNA damage response and supporting glioma stem cell self-renewal. Our analysis of HGG TCGA data and immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated Smad2, which is the main transducer of canonical TGF-beta signaling, indicated variable levels of TGF-beta pathway activation across HGG tumors. These data suggest that evaluating the putative benefit of inhibiting TGF-beta during radiotherapy requires personalized screening. Thus, we used explant cultures of seven HGG specimens as a rapid, patient-specific ex vivo platform to test the hypothesis that LY364947, a small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-beta type I receptor, acts as a radiosensitizer in HGG. Immunofluorescence detection and image analysis of gamma-H2AX foci, a marker of cellular recognition of radiation-induced DNA damage, and Sox2, a stem cell marker that increases post-radiation, indicated that LY364947 blocked these radiation responses in five of seven specimens. Collectively, our findings suggest that TGF-beta signaling increases radioresistance in most, but not all, HGGs. We propose that short-term culture of HGG explants provides a flexible and rapid platform for screening context-dependent efficacy of radiosensitizing agents in patient-specific fashion. This time- and cost-effective approach could be used to personalize treatment plans in HGG patients.",Excluded

696,"Contrasting the effects of proton irradiation on dendritic complexity of subiculum neurons in wild type and MCAT mice Growing evidence suggests that radiation-induced oxidative stress directly affects a wide range of biological changes with an overall negative impact on CNS function. In the past we have demonstrated that transgenic mice over-expressing human catalase targeted to the mitochondria (MCAT) exhibit a range of neuroprotective phenotypes following irradiation that include improved neurogenesis, dendritic complexity, and cognition. To determine the extent of the neuroprotective phenotype afforded by MCAT expression in different hippocampal regions, we analyzed subiculum neurons for changes in neuronal structure and synaptic integrity after exposure to low dose (0.5 Gy) 150 MeV proton irradiation. One month following irradiation of WT and MCAT mice, a range of morphometric parameters were quantified along Golgi-Cox impregnated neurons. Compared with WT mice, subiculum neurons from MCAT mice exhibited increased trends (albeit not statistically significant) toward increased dendritic complexity in both control and irradiated cohorts. However, Sholl analysis of MCAT mice revealed significantly increased arborization of the distal dendritic tree, indicating a protective effect on secondary and tertiary branching. Interestingly, radiation-induced increases in postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95) puncta were not as pronounced in MCAT compared with WT mice, and were significantly lower after the 0.5 Gy dose. As past data has linked radiation exposure to reduced dendritic complexity, elevated PSD-95 and impaired cognition, reductions in mitochondrial oxidative stress have proven useful in ameliorating many of these radiation-induced sequelae. Data presented here shows similar trends, and again points to the potential benefits of reducing oxidative stress in the brain to attenuate radiation injury. Environ. Mol.

However, research on the imaging performance of RION is not sufficient. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) early after injury of the optic nerve of rhesus monkeys by a single-dose/fractionation-scheme of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intraorbital optic nerve contour of 5 rhesus monkeys was acquired by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Then, the unilateral intraorbital optic nerves of 5 rhesus monkeys were injured by gamma knife surgery (GKS) with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve). DTI was performed before the irradiation and 1week, 2weeks, 4weeks, and 24weeks after injury to obtain the cross-sectional area, and the fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) values.RESULTS: The cross-sectional area of the injured optic nerve exhibited significant atrophy 24weeks after SRS. FA declined 1week after injury; this value then increased slightly but remained lower than before injury (P<0.05). AD began to decline in the 2weeks after injury and gradually disappeared (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: SRS with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve) on the unilateral intraorbital optic nerve can induce RION. DTI can detect RION at an early stage. FA and AD are useful indicators for RION diagnosis. In the early stage, the primary site of RION may be the vascular endothelium.",Included

In our study, we compared the prophylactic and therapeutic usage of a promising agent, ramipril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), with that of bevacizumab for reducing radiation-induced brain injury after high-dose stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: A total of 60 Wistar rats were used. The rats were irradiated with a single dose of 50 Gy using a Leksell Gamma Knife device. Bevacizumab and ramipril were administered in the prophylactic protocol (starting the first day of SRS) and in the therapeutic protocol (starting the fourth week of SRS). Their usage was continued until 12 weeks, and the right frontal lobes of the rats were examined histologically (hematoxylin and eosin stain) and immunohistochemically (hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF]-1alpha, VEGF, and CD31 antibody expression).RESULTS: The expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and CD31 had significantly increased at 12 weeks after SRS compared with the control group. The addition of bevacizumab or ramipril to SRS significantly mitigated the histological severity of radiation injury and the expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and CD31. However, the prophylactic use of bevacizumab and ramipril seemed to be more effective than therapeutic administration. Our results also revealed that the greatest benefit was achieved with the use of prophylactic administration of bevacizumab compared with other treatment protocols.CONCLUSIONS: Ramipril might be a promising agent for patients with radionecrosis. Clinical studies are required to investigate the effective and safe doses of ramipril, which is an inexpensive, well-tolerated drug that can cross the blood-brain barrier.",Excluded
1046,"Risk of Hippocampal Metastases in Small Cell Lung Cancer: Implications for Hippocampal Sparing Cranial Irradiation Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) decreases the incidence of brain metastases (BMs) and can improve overall survival. However whole brain radiation therapy is associated with a decline in neurocognitive function. Hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiation therapy (HS-WBRT) aims to minimise damage to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) within the hippocampus and reduce the toxicity of PCI, although there may be an increased risk of treatment failure in the hippocampal region. The incidence of hippocampal metastases was investigated in patients with BMs from SCLC to evaluate the feasibility of HS-WBRT in this population. Method(s): Patients with SCLC presenting between 2000 and 2016 with BMs at presentation or during their disease course without previous cranial irradiation were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Hippocampal metastases (HMs) were defined as metastases within the hippocampus and a 5-mm radial expansion (hippocampus avoidance zone, according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0933 atlas). The rate of hippocampal metastases and associated clinical features were analysed. Result(s): One hundred and twenty eligible patients with a total of 754 brain metastases were identified. In 67 (55.8%) patients BMs were detected at diagnosis of SCLC and in 53 (44.2%) patients BMs developed later without previous PCI. The median number of metastases was 3, and 27 (22.5%) patients had a single BM. There were 22 (18.3%) patients with hippocampal metastases. A total of 23 (3.1%) metastases involved the hippocampal avoidance area. On logistic regression analysis, the number of brain metastases was an independent risk factor for HMs. Conclusion(s): The overall incidence of hippocampal metastases in our cohort of SCLC patients is high. As HS-WBRT may increase the risk of treatment failure in the spared region, prospective randomised trials are encouraged.

770,"The localisation of radiolabelled murine monoclonal antibody 81C6 and its Fab fragment in human glioma xenografts in athymic mice The localisation of the radioiodinated Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody (Mab) 81C6, reactive with a glioma-associated extracellular matrix antigen, was studied in athymic mice bearing subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts of D-54 MG glioma cells. In vitro 81C6 Fab showed a marked loss of immunoreactivity and affinity for antigen compared to intact Mab 81C6. In vivo, the plasma half-life of 81C6 Fab was 7.0 hours compared to 2.1 days for 81C6. 81C6 Fab levels in tumours peaked at 2.6-3.8% injected dose/g in 2-6 h; Mab 81C6 reached 33.9% dose/g at 48 h. Localisation indices and tumour:tissue ratios were superior for Mab 81C6. Estimated radiation doses to tumour and normal tissues were lower for 131I-81C6 Fab than 131I-81C6. To realise the theoretical benefits of fragments as localising agents, Fab fragments of higher immunoreactivity and affinity, or bivalent F(ab')2 fragments are required.",Excluded
452,"Effects of oxygen and bFGF on the vulnerability of photoreceptors to light damage PURPOSE: To test whether tissue oxygen levels affect the vulnerability of photoreceptors to damage by bright continuous light (BCL).METHODS: Albino rats were raised in standard conditions of cyclic light (12-hour light, 12-hour darkness) with the light level at 5 to 10 lux or 40 to 65 lux. They were then exposed to BCL (1000-1400 lux), either continuously for 48 hours or for the day or night components of the 48-hour period. During BCL, some rats were kept in room air (normoxia, 21% oxygen), some in hypoxia (10%), and some in hyperoxia (70%). Their retinas were examined for cell death, for the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and for response to light (electroretinogram, ERG).RESULTS: The death of retinal cells induced by BCL was confined to photoreceptors. Within the retina, the severity of death was inversely related to the level of bFGF immunolabeling in the somas of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) before exposure. The death of photoreceptors was accompanied by an upregulation of bFGF protein levels in the ONL and by a decline in the ERG. Both hypoxia and hyperoxia during BCL reduced the photoreceptor death, bFGF upregulation, and ERG decline caused by BCL. The protective effects of hyperoxia and hypoxia were evident during both the day and night halves of the daily cycle. Hypoxia or hyperoxia alone did not upregulate bFGF or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) expression in the retina.CONCLUSIONS: Photoreceptors are protected from light damage by hypoxia and hyperoxia during exposure. The protection provided by oxygen levels operates during both day and night. The protection is not mediated by an upregulation of bFGF or CNTF.",Excluded
355,"Quantitative mapping of ion channel regulation by visual cycle activity in rodent photoreceptors in vivo PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that the extent of outer retina uptake of manganese, measured noninvasively with manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI), is a quantitative biomarker of photoreceptor ion channel regulation by visual cycle activity.METHODS: Four groups of animals were studied: control rats adapted to three different background light intensities, dark-adapted control mice systemically pretreated with retinylamine, and dark-adapted mice with a nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the RPE65 gene (RPE65(rd12)) with and without systemic 11-cis-retinal pretreatment. In all cases, rodents were anesthetized and studied with MEMRI 4 hours after manganese administration IP. Central retinal thickness and intraretinal ion channel regulation were measured from the MEMRI data.RESULT: No differences (P>0.05) in retinal thickness were noted within any arm of this study. In rats, manganese uptake was inversely proportional to the background light intensity in the outer retina but not in the inner retina. Specific inhibition at the level of RPE65 activity, either acutely with retinylamine or chronically in RPE65(rd12) mice, similarly reduced (P<0.05) outer retinal manganese uptake compared with that in control mice. In RPE65(rd12) mice, outer retinal manganese uptake returned to normal (P>0.05) after 11-cis retinal treatment. Inner retinal uptake was supernormal (P<0.05) in retinylamine-treated mice but normal in untreated or 11-cis treated RPE65(rd12) mice.CONCLUSIONS: The present data support measuring the extent of manganese uptake in the outer retina as an analytic noninvasive metric of visual cycle regulation of photoreceptor ion channel activity in vivo.",Excluded

295,"Primary central nerous system lymphomas Purpose of review: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B cell lymphoma that occurs in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. Primary ocular lymphoma represents an important variant of this disease. The outcome for patients with PCNSL is rapidly improving with new treatment strategies. This review focuses on recent advances, investigations, and controversies in the management of these increasingly important malignancies. Recent findings: The incidence of PCNSL is rising in immunocompetent patients over the age of 60 years for unexplained reasons. However, the incidence of AIDS-related PCNSL, which is related to Epstein-Barr virus infections, has fallen with the institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy. During the past decade, standard therapy has evolved from cranial irradiation to high dose methotrexate-based regimens. This shift in therapy has been associated with an increase in the median survival of patients from 1 year to longer than 3 years, and with an equally striking reduction in neurotoxicity if whole brain radiation is avoided. Optimal therapeutic results require careful attention to opportunistic infections, thromboembolic disease, and renal toxicities associated with high dose methotrexate. Summary: Overall, PCNSLs are increasing in frequency and the results of therapy for this disease have dramatically improved during the past decade. Many important therapeutic questions remain unanswered. These include the optimal dose, frequency, and duration of methotrexate, as well as the roles of additional systemic chemotherapy drugs, intrathecal therapy, and cranial irradiation. Further progress in this uncommon disease will depend on entering patients into carefully designed multicenter clinical trials to build upon the significant advances that have been made. © 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
1162,"Malignant glioma in regional and rural communities: Communication, education and needs Background: Patients with malignant glioma are usually managed in neurosurgical tertiary referral centres, however 30% return to their regional/ rural location for ongoing care. This study explored levels of communication, education and the needs of patients and doctors. Method(s): A survey was designed, targeting regional/rural oncologists, general practitioners (GPs) and patients with malignant glioma. The survey was funded by a Western and Central Melbourne Integrated Cancer Service (WCMICS) grant. Questions to doctors included: adequacy of referral information, access to services and areas they would like to improve knowledge skills. Patient questions included: information provided at diagnosis, ability to access medical services and improved clinical support. Result(s): The overall response rate was 49% (8 oncologists, 30 GPs, 9 patients). 70% of GPs felt the information received from the hospital was 'adequate' or 'excellent'. Doctors sought: improved communication and support regarding clinical decision making (multi-disciplinary care), education regarding the use of dexamethasone, antiepileptics, novel therapies and recommendations regarding driving. 37% of GPs had 'low': confidence in managing patients with malignant gliomas. 78% of patients felt they were provided 'enough' information at diagnosis. The three most comprehensive information sources for patients were their surgeon, medical oncologist and radiation oncologist. 56% of patients requested improved carer support and 67% would seek initial assistance from their GP for any issue related to their brain tumour. Conclusion(s): While communication between the tertiary hospital and regional/rural centres is occurring consistently, we have identified a number of areas where clinical care can be improved. An action plan is being developed to address educational needs for regional/rural doctors, and additional information provision for patients and their carers.",Excluded
1131,"Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy in women treated for carcinoma of the breast OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical presentation and natural history of radiation-induced brachial plexopathy in 33 women treated for carcinoma of the breast.METHODS: All of the patients were referred to a single consultant neurologist. Details of surgical procedures, radiotherapy, symptoms at presentation and follow-up and neurological findings were recorded. Patients were reviewed at six or 12 monthly intervals for 2-19 years (median 9.5 years). Investigations included blood tests, chest X-ray, bone scan, neurophysiological studies, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine and cerebrospinal fluid examination.RESULTS: Symptoms began from six months to 20 years after radiotherapy (median time 1.5 years). Progressive weakness was universal and resulted in loss of any useful hand function in all but three patients. The time taken to loss of useful hand function ranged from six weeks to five years (median 1.25 years). Three patterns of upper limb weakness were identified, distal limb weakness only (13 patients), global limb weakness that was more marked distally (11 patients), and completely flaccid arm (10 patients). Seventeen patients required long-term morphine to palliate pain. A chemical sympathectomy benefited three patients.CONCLUSIONS: Most patients developed symptoms within three years, but late presentations 8-20 years later were encountered. Symptoms were progressive in all patients, though the rate did vary. Pain was common and persisted indefinitely in all but one patient. Morphine was effective and should be used early and in adequate doses. Chemical sympathectomy provided sustained relief in three of six patients.",Excluded
341,"Feasibility of central cannabinoid CB1 receptor imaging with [124I]AM281 PET demonstrated in a schizophrenic patient We studied central cannabinoid CB1 receptors in a schizophrenic patient using the pyrazole derivative AM281 labelled with the positron-emitting nuclide iodine-124. A dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition with simultaneous blood sampling was performed up to 1.5 h post-injection. The classical Logan plot analysis was applied to generate a three-dimensional map of distribution volume (DV). The map was spatially normalised into the Montreal Neurological Institute stereotactic space. Using a volume of interest (VOI) template, mean values of DV were extracted from multiple grey matter regions and white matter (as a reference). As a measure of regional receptor availability, ratios of DV in grey matter to DV in white matter minus one (DVR-1) were calculated. The highest receptor binding was observed in the striatum and the pallidum (DVR-1: 0.35-0.37). Binding in basal ganglia regions was lower on the left than the right side. Moderately high binding was seen in the frontal cortex (0.22), the temporal cortex (0.18) and the cerebellum (0.15). In conclusion, 124I-AM281 PET can be used to reveal areas with prominent CB1 receptor binding. Nevertheless, limited image contrast and relatively high radiation exposure (physical half-life of 124I: 4 days) have to be taken into account. Asymmetric receptor binding may possibly reflect pathologic changes in schizophrenia.",Excluded

160,"Monoaminergic modulation of the Na+-activated K+ channel in Kenyon cells isolated from the mushroom body of the cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) brain Recent studies have suggested that octopamine (OA) and dopamine (DA) play important roles in mediating the reward and punishment signals, respectively, in olfactory learning in insect. However, their target molecules and the signaling mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we showed for the first time that OA and DA modulate the Na+-activated K+ (KNa) channels in an opposite way in Kenyon cells isolated from the mushroom body of the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. Patch-clamp recordings showed that the single-channel conductance of the KNa channel was about 122 pS with high K+ in the patch pipettes. The channel was found to be activated by intracellular Na+ but less activated by Li+. K+ channel blockers TEA and quinidine reduced the open probability (Po) of this channel. Bath application of OA and DA respectively increased and decreased the Po of KNa channel currents. An increase and a decrease in Po of KNa channels were also observed by applying the membrane-permeable analogs 8-Br-cyclic-AMP and 8-Br-cGMP, respectively. Furthermore, it was revealed that cAMP-induced increase and cGMP-induced decrease in Po were attenuated by the specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 and protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor KT5823, respectively. These results indicate that the KNa channel is a target molecule for OA and DA and that cAMP/PKA and cGMP/PKG signaling pathways are also involved in the modulation of KNa channels.",Excluded
23,"Intrathecal sICAM-1 production in multiple sclerosis Correlation with triple dose Gd-DTPA MRI enhancement and IgG index In this study the aim was to evaluate the intrathecal sICAM-1 production in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients during relapse and remission. In addition to this, we assessed whether there is a correlation between intrathecal sICAM-1 production and other disease activity markers such as IgG index and gadolinium enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty four relapsing- remitting MS patients were included in the study. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained both during relapse and remission. The soluble form of ICAM (sICAM) was measured by the ELISA method in serum and CSF. Cranial MRI with triple dose gadolinium injection was performed for each patient both during relapse and remission. Serum levels of sICAM-1 (245.23+/-92.88 ng/ml) were higher during relapse than those in remission (219.90+/-110.94 ng/ml), but the difference was not statistically significant. In relapse periods CSF levels of sICAM-1 (1.304+/-0.92 ng/ml) were higher than those in remission (1.06+/-0.86 ng/ml), but this was not significant. However, during relapse periods patients had significantly higher sICAM-1 index values (1.76+/-0.60) than those found during remission periods (1.01+/-0.44) (p<0.05). The IgG index values were higher in relapse periods than in remission (0.88+/-0.37 vs. 0.67+/-0.28) (p<0.005). On T1 weighted images following triple dose Gd injection, at least two or more enhancing lesions were present in 22/24 of the patients (91 %) in relapse and 4/24 of the patients (19 %) in remission. There was strong correlation both between the sICAM-1 index and Gd enhancement (r=0.72 p<0.05) and sICAM-1 index and IgG index in relapse (r=0.69 p<0.05). In conclusion, there is association between high sICAM-1 and IgG indices, as well as between high sICAM-1 index and Gd enhancing MRI lesions in relapsing MS patients.",Excluded
328,"Measurement of cerebral ventricular sizes and parenchymal abnormalities on bedside by ultrasound sonography in patients with craniectomy: Comparison with CCT Introduction: In patients with craniectomy ventricular size and parenchymal abnormalities are reliably estimated by CCT or MRI. Both techniques are time consuming; CCT involves frequent radiation exposure. Measurement of ventricular sizes or parenchymal abnormalities by ultrasound sonography is rarely performed. Aim of the study: To compare data of measurements of the ventricular size and anatomic structures by ultrasound sonography and CCT in patients (n = 62) with craniectomy following traumatic or vascular accidents. Method(s): Transcranial Duplex sonography (Hitachi-EUB 5000+C; 5-2/Abdominal probe; 1.4 MHz) over the craniectomized hemisphere. Documentation of land marks such as alteration of parenchymal structure, extravascular blood accumulation, hygroma, ventricular diameter, midline shift. Data of ventricular diameter were correlated with measurements obtained by CCT. Result(s): Sonography of the brain's structures and vessels by ultrasound sonography provide sharp outlined pictures which can be compared to CCT imaging with high reliability. Aneurysms larger than 10 mm in diameter were identified in some cases. The correlation of the diameter of the ventricles of the craniectomized and the contralateral side between ultrasound measurement and CCT was high (correlation coeffizient 0.826 for the first and 0.959 for subsequent measurements). In repetitive studies of the ultrasound measurements over a few days (without repetitive CCT), the stability of the diameter was high. Alteration of the horizontal body position between zero and 45 degrees did not affect the diameter of the ventricles. Midline shifts were detected with high reliability. Quantitative measurement of the blood flow velocity in the large intracerebral vessels using the Doppler modus was possible. Summary: B-mode ultrasound measurements of the ventricular size, the parenchyma and of the blood flow velocity in patients with craniectomy deliver reliable quantitative results for clinical neurosurgical and neurological decisions and may economize indication for frequent CCT.",Excluded
1058,"Stereotactic LINAC-radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors: A long-term follow-up of 27 patients Background: The optimal treatment of glomus jugulare tumors (GJTs) remains controversial. Due to the critical location, microsurgery still provides high treatment-related morbidity and a decreased quality of life. Thus, we performed stereotactical radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of GJTs and evaluated the long-term outcome. Method(s): Between 1991 and 2011, 32 patients with GJTs underwent SRS using a linear accelerator (LINAC) either as primary or salvage therapy. Twenty-seven patients (median age 59.9 years, range 28.7-79.9 years) with a follow-up greater than five years (median 11 years, range 5.3-22.1 years) were selected for retrospective analysis. The median therapeutic single dose applied to the tumor surface was 15 Gy (range 11-20 Gy) and the median tumor volume was 9.5 ml (range 2.8-51 ml). Result(s): Following LINAC-SRS, 10 of 27 patients showed a significant improvement of their previous neurological complaints, whereas 12 patients remained unchanged. Five patients died during follow-up due to old age or other, not treatment-related reasons. MR-imaging showed a partial remission in 12 and a stable disease in 15 patients. No tumor progression was observed. The actuarial overall survival rates after five, ten and 20 years were 100%, 95.2% and 79.4%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic LINAC-Radiosurgery can achieve an excellent long-term tumor control beside a low rate of morbidity in the treatment of GJTs. It should be considered as an alternative therapy regime to surgical resection or fractionated external beam radiation either as primary, adjuvant or salvage therapy.

1062,"Carotid ultrasound identifies high risk subclinical atherosclerosis in adults with low framingham risk scores BACKGROUND: Worldwide, cardiovascular (CV) disease remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality. Although effective in predicting CV risk in select populations, the Framingham risk score (FRS) fails to identify many young individuals who experience premature CV events. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) or plaque, a marker of atherosclerosis and predictor of CV events, in young asymptomatic individuals with low and intermediate FRS (<2% annualized event rate) using the carotid ultrasound protocol recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Vascular Medicine.METHODS: Individuals aged < or = 65 years not taking statins and without diabetes mellitus or histories of coronary artery disease underwent CIMT and plaque examination for primary prevention. Clinical variables including lipid values, family history of premature coronary artery disease, and FRS and subsequent pharmacotherapy recommendations were retrospectively collected for statistical analysis.RESULTS: Of 441 subjects (mean age, 49.7 + or - 7.9 years), 184 (42%; 95% confidence interval, 37.3%-46.5%) had high-risk carotid ultrasound findings (CIMT > or = 75th percentile adjusted for age, gender, and race or presence of plaque). Of those with the lowest FRS of < or =5% (n = 336) (mean age, 48.0 + or - 7.6 years; mean FRS, 2.5 + or - 1.5%), 127 (38%; 95% confidence interval, 32.6%-43.0%) had high-risk carotid ultrasound findings. For individuals with FRS < or = 5% and high-risk carotid ultrasound findings (n = 127; mean age, 47.3 + or - 8.1 years; mean FRS, 2.5 + or - 1.5%), lipid-lowering therapy was recommended by their treating physicians in 77 (61%).CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-eight percent of asymptomatic young to middle-aged individuals with FRS < or = 5% have abnormal carotid ultrasound findings associated with increased risk for CV events. Pharmacologic therapy for CV prevention was recommended in the majority of these individuals. The lack of radiation exposure, relatively low cost, and ability to detect early-stage atherosclerosis suggest that carotid ultrasound for CIMT and plaque detection should continue to be explored as a primary tool for CV risk stratification in young to middle-aged adults with low FRS.",Excluded
800,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the treatment of Nelson's syndrome: a multicenter, international study OBJECTIVE: Nelson's syndrome is a rare and challenging neuroendocrine disorder, and it is associated with elevated adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) level, skin hyperpigmentation, and pituitary adenoma growth. Management options including resection and medical therapy are traditional approaches. Ionizing radiation in the form of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is also being utilized to treat Nelson's syndrome. In the current study the authors sought to better define the therapeutic role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in Nelson's syndrome.METHODS: Study patients with Nelson's syndrome were treated with single-fraction GKRS (median margin dose of 25 Gy) at 6 different centers as part of an International Radiosurgery Research Foundation (IRRF) investigation. Data including neurological function, endocrine response, and radiological tumor response were collected and sent to the study-coordinating center for review. Fifty-one patients with median endocrine and radiological follow-ups of 91 and 80.5 months from GKRS, respectively, were analyzed for endocrine remission, tumor control, and neurological outcome. Statistical methods were used to identify prognostic factors for these endpoints.RESULTS: At last follow-up, radiological tumor control was achieved in 92.15% of patients. Endocrine remission off medical management and reduction in pre-SRS ACTH level were achieved in 29.4% and 62.7% of patients, respectively. Improved remission rates were associated with a shorter time interval between resection and GKRS (p = 0.039). Hypopituitarism was seen in 21.6% and new visual deficits were demonstrated in 15.7% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: GKRS affords a high rate of pituitary adenoma control and improvement in ACTH level for the majority of Nelson's syndrome patients. Hypopituitarism is the most common adverse effect from GKRS in Nelson's syndrome patients and warrants longitudinal follow-up for detection and endocrine replacement.",Excluded
707,"Spatio-temporal analysis of molecular delivery through the blood-brain barrier using focused ultrasound The deposition of gadolinium through ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings in the murine hippocampus was investigated. First, wave propagation simulations through the intact mouse skull revealed minimal beam distortion while thermal deposition simulations, at the same sonication parameters used to induce BBB opening in vivo, revealed temperature increases lower than 0.5 degrees C. The simulation results were validated experimentally in ex vivo skulls (m = 6) and in vitro tissue specimens. Then, in vivo mice (n = 9) were injected with microbubbles (Optison; 25-50 microl) and sonicated (frequency: 1.525 MHz, pressure amplitudes: 0.5-1.1 MPa, burst duration: 20 ms, duty cycle: 20%, durations: 2-4 shots, 30 s per shot, 30 s interval) at the left hippocampus, through intact skin and skull. Sequential, high-resolution, T1-weighted MRI (9.4 Tesla, in-plane resolution: 75 microm, scan time: 45-180 min) with gadolinium (Omniscan; 0.5 ml) injected intraperitoneally revealed a threshold of the BBB opening at 0.67 MPa and BBB closing within 28 h from opening. The contrast-enhancement area and gadolinium deposition path were monitored over time and the influence of vessel density, size and location was determined. Sonicated arteries, or their immediate surroundings, depicted greater contrast enhancement than sonicated homogeneous brain tissue regions. In conclusion, gadolinium was delivered through a transiently opened BBB and contained to a specific brain region (i.e., the hippocampus) using a single-element focused ultrasound transducer. It was also found that the amount of gadolinium deposited in the hippocampal region increased with the acoustic pressure and that the spatial distribution of the BBB opening was determined not only by the ultrasound beam, but also by the vasculature of the targeted brain region.",Excluded
457,"Otolith adaptive responses to altered gravity The force of gravity has remained constantly present over the course of animal evolution and forms our frame of reference with the environment, including spatial orientation, navigation, gaze and postural stability. Inertial head accelerations occur within this gravity frame of reference naturally during voluntary movements and perturbations. Execution of movements of aquatic, terrestrial and flight species widely differ, but the sensory systems detecting acceleration forces, including gravity, have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. A sudden or persistent change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound and global effects on an organism. Physiological data collected immediately after orbital missions, after short and extended increases in gravity load via centrifugation, and after readaptation to normal gravity exist in the toadfish model.

The spontaneous SCE levels did not differ between patients and controls, but the cells from each of the patients showed a significantly enhanced response to the induction of SCE by both mutagens - the patients' cells being up to 50% more sensitive than controls. Cultures from five FrA patients and five controls were analysed to determine the spontaneous incidence of chromosomal aberrations and exposed to a graded series of X-ray doses to measure their response to radiation-induced chromosome damage. The spontaneous aberration incidence in controls did not differ from that found in other control series, but the background incidence of aberrations in cells from the FrA patients was significantly above control levels and appeared to reflect an enhanced response to diagnostic exposure to radionuclides. The FrA cells showed a significantly enhanced in vitro response to chromosome aberration induction by X-rays, the net aberration yields being some 60% greater than those in irradiated controls at doses up to 200 rads. It is concluded that FrA is yet another syndrome which shows hypersensitivity to the induction of chromosome damage by mutagens.

1082,"Clinical laboratory findings and results of therapy in 55 patients with Cushing's syndrome In this study, 55 patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) (50 female, 5 male; mean age 34 +/- 12.3 yr) who attended our clinics between the years 1983 and 2000 were retrospectively evaluated for clinical and laboratory features and modalities and results of therapy, due to a few similar studies over the last ten years. Cushing's disease was diagnosed in 39 patients (71%), adrenal adenoma in 13 patients (23.6%) and adrenal carcinoma in 3 patients (5.5%). Centripedal obesity, moon face, hypertension, hirsutism and purplish stria were the most frequent findings. Loss of normal serum F circadian rhythm was found in all patients with CS. The overnight 1 mg oral dexamethasone suppression test and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) yielded 100% and 100% diagnostic sensitivity for CS, respectively. Sensitivity and specivity of the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST) in distinguishing Cushing's disease was found to be 82% and 100%, respectively. All of the patients with adrenal CS were not suppressed with HDDST. Sellar CT and/or MRI accurately identified the tumor in 58% of these patients. Recurrence was observed in 3 (11%) of the 28 patients with Cushing's disease, treated by transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Recurrence was diagnosed 1.5, 3 and 6 yr after the operation in these 3 patients. One patient had residue tumor. In our case series, bilateral adrenalectomy plus pituitary irradiation achieved the highest remission rate (100%) in Cushing's disease. In 2 out of 4 patients (50%) treated by left adrenalectomy associated with pituitary irradiation, recurrence was observed. Panhypopituitarism due to tumor apoplexy was observed in one of the patients with Cushing's disease. All of the patients with adrenal CS, the tumor was accurately localized with imaging methods before the operation. The appropriate operative procedure resulted in complete remission in patients with adrenal adenoma. Consequently, Cushing's disease was the most common form of CS. The overnight 1 mg oral DST and 24-h urine free F excretion (UFC) as screening tests, 2-day LDDST as diagnostic test and 2-day HDDST as differential diagnostic test were good studies. More successful outcomes have been achieved in treatment of Cushing's disease with the development of pituitary surgery in the recent years, as well as in our case series. Surgery is also curative for adrenal adenoma patients. Survival remains poor among carcinoma patients.",Excluded

758,"Living positively after a diagnosis of Parkinson's I was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson Disease in 1994 at the age of 42. I was an Astronaut with two space shuttle missions already completed. I was aware of the progressive and degenerative path the disease follows but, I was not ready to quit flying into earth orbit. NASA managers responsible for crew selection and certification were fully behind my desire to continue in the cue for another space mission. With the exception of the NASA leadership I kept my condition as a secret for 17 years. I was assigned to a third space shuttle mission and I performed a space walk during the mission in March 1996. This was very rewarding. I told myself to ""Live life to the fullest extent possible"". My message to those with Parkinson Disease is you can do anything you want to do - maybe not as well as you use to perform. I still play golf. My game is not as good as it was years ago but I enjoy the game. My friends enjoy playing with me and the exercise is good therapy. The disease has progressed as expected. I no longer fly privately and I do miss the exhilaration of precise flying. I still live life's adventures to the fullest. I encourage those with Parkinson Disease to be well informed of current research and the multitude of varied therapy options. Any program that improves the quality of your life should be explored. Exploration is fun and beneficial. Stories from my space shuttle missions will be interjected at appropriate places for emphasis. The theme of the presentation is ""Life is Good - Make the most of your opportunities."".",Excluded
7,"Increase of mtDNA number and its mutant copies in rat brain after exposure to 150 MeV protons Proton beam therapy is widely used for treating brain tumor. Despite the efficacy of treatment, the use of this therapy has met some limitations associated with possible damage to normal brain tissues located beyond the tumor site. In this context, the exploration of the harmful effects of protons on the normal brain tissues is of particular interest. We have investigated changes in the total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and identified mtDNA mutant copies in three brain regions (the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum) of rats after irradiation their whole-head with 150 MeV protons at doses of 3 and 5 Gy. The study was performed in 2-months old male Spraque Dawley rats (n = 5 each group). The mtDNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR. The level of mtDNA heteroplasmy was estimated using Surveyor nuclease technology. Our results show that after head exposure to protons, levels of mtDNA copy number in three rat brain regions increase significantly as the levels of mtDNA mutant copies increase. The most significant elevation is observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, an increase in mtDNA mutant copies may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by increased oxidative stress in different brain regions and promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the induction of carcinogenesis.",Included

Understanding the sequela of systemic involvement is key for proper diagnosis and treatment. Recent Findings: Over the decades, new research has emerged regarding neurological complications of the myeloid or lymphoid leukemias. Central nervous system involvement usually confers a poor prognosis and requires emergent treatment. Standard of care still involves systemic therapy, intrathecal administration of chemotherapeutic agents, and cranial radiation. Treatment-related side effects can occur and need to be recognized by any practitioner involved with patient care.

536,"Evaluation of the RF heating of a generic deep brain stimulator exposed in 1.5 T magnetic resonance scanners The radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic field of magnetic resonance (MR) scanners can result in significant tissue heating due to the RF coupling with the conducting parts of medical implants. The objective of this article is to evaluate the advantages and shortcomings of a new four-tier approach based on a combined numerical and experimental procedure, designed to demonstrate safety of implants during MR scans. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study analyzing this technique. The evaluation is performed for 1.5 T MR scanners using a generic model of a deep brain stimulator (DBS) with a straight lead and a helical lead. The results show that the approach is technically feasible and provides sound and conservative information about the potential heating of implants. We demonstrate that (1) applying optimized tools results in reasonable uncertainties for the overall evaluation; (2) each tier reduces the overestimation by several dB at the cost of more demanding evaluation steps; (3) the implant with the straight lead would cause local temperature increases larger than 18 degreeC at the RF exposure limit for the normal operating mode; (4) Tier 3 is not sufficient for the helical implant; and (5) Tier 4 might be too demanding to be performed for complex implants. We conclude with a suggestion for a procedure that follows the same concept but is between Tier 3 and 4. In addition, the evaluation of Tier 3 has shown consistency with current scan practice, namely, the resulting heat at the lead tip is less than 3.5 degreeC for the straight lead and 0.7 degreeC for the helix lead for scans at the current applied MR scan restrictions for deep brain stimulation at a head average SAR of 0.1 W/kg.",Excluded
30,"AlphaB-crystallin (aBC) expression in breast cancer brain metastases (BM) and primary breast cancer (pBC) with eventual BM and association with outcome Background: aBC, a small heat shock protein, is commonly expressed in basal BC and predicts poor survival in BC patients (pts). aBC has been associated with the development of BM within basal BC. We evaluated the expression of aBC in BM and pBC with eventual BM and its association with survival. Method(s): Under IRB approval (UNC/Duke), we established a clinically-annotated biobank from 78 pts: 51 BM and 38 pBC with eventual BM (11 were matched BC and BM pairs); 59 pts had complete treatment (tx) data. IHC subtype was assigned for BM and pBC: HR+ (hormone receptor)/HER2-, triple-negative (TN; ER-/PR-/HER2-), and HR+or-/HER2+. aBC expression was based on % of positively stained tumor cells: negative (0%), weak (<30%) and strong positive (30%). Overall survival (OS) and survival after BM were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test). Result(s): Median age was 50 yrs (26-84). 67% were Caucasian, 32% African American. 90% received systemic tx for metastatic BC, of which 67% followed BM. 90% received local tx (resection and/or radiation) for BM. There was no difference in receipt of local or systemic tx by aBC. Subtype for pBC (n=36) was 31% (HR+/HER2-), 42% (TN), and 28% (HR+or-/HER2+); for BM (n=42) 33%, 43% and 24%, respectively. aBC was expressed in 37% (14/38) of pBC and 47% (24/51) of BM. Concordance of aBC expression between pBC and BM was 55% (6/11). Gain of aBC expression (4/11) was more common in BM than loss (1/11). aBC was more commonly expressed in TNBC (pBC 73%; BM 67%) compared to HR+/HER2- (pBC 9%; 29% BM) or HR+or-/HER2+ (pBC 0%; 30% BM). OS and survival after BM differed by subtype (all p<0.02); pts with TNBC experienced the poorest outcome. OS and survival after BM was inferior for all pts (n=38) and those with TNBC (n=15) whose pBC expressed aBC (Table). aBC expression within BM was not prognostic (p>0.05). Conclusion(s): aBC expression in BM and pBC with eventual BM is frequent and associated with TNBC. Among pts with BM, expression of aBC in the pBC predicts for inferior OS and survival after BM even among poor prognosis pts with TNBC BM. (Table Presented).",Excluded
528,"Evaluating the clinical effectiveness of 90Y-SMT 487 in patients with neuroendocrine tumors UNLABELLED: Because of the presence of cell membrane somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), many neuroendocrine tumors will bind analogs of somatostatin. (90)Y-Dodecanetetraacetic acid-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (SMT 487) is an SSTR radiopharmaceutical currently under investigation as a therapeutic option for neuroendocrine tumors. Although there are a variety of methods for evaluating response to a given cancer therapy, an important indicator of success is the impact on the clinical status of the patient. The purpose of this work was to develop a semiquantitative method and assess the clinical effectiveness of (90)Y-SMT 487 therapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors.METHODS: A scoring system was developed to evaluate clinical response that included the following parameters: weight, health status score (determined by the patient), Karnofsky score, and tumor-related symptoms.RESULTS: We applied this scoring system to 21 patients who had completed 3 cycles of therapy with (90)Y-SMT 487. Fourteen of the 21 showed a favorable clinical response, whereas 5 were clinically stable after treatment and 2 showed evidence of clinical progression. There was also a significant reduction in the amount of octreotide being used after completion of (90)Y-SMT 487 therapy in the 20 patients who were on this medication.CONCLUSION: Using this scoring method, (90)Y-SMT 487 appears effective in improving the clinical status of patients with (111)In-pentetreotide-positive neuroendocrine tumors.",Excluded
648,"Characterization of structurally distinct, isoform-selective phosphoinositide 3'-kinase inhibitors in combination with radiation in the treatment of glioblastoma The phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling pathway plays a key role in fundamental cellular functions important in normal cellular homeostasis and malignant transformation. Deregulated signaling through this pathway contributes to development of gliomas and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway has thus emerged as a promising approach to successful treatment of gliomas. We assessed the radiosensitizing potential of four small-molecule inhibitors that differ in their activities against specific isoforms of the PI3K 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). p110alpha inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of both protein kinase B/Akt and S6 in all cell lines examined, effectively decreased cellular proliferation, and produced additive cytotoxic effects in combination with radiation therapy. The p110beta inhibitor exhibited limited biochemical effects and failed to decrease cellular proliferation or viability as either a single agent or in combination with radiation or rapamycin. In vivo studies examining the effects of the p110alpha inhibitor in combination with radiation indicated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate induced by the combined treatment compared with each treatment modality alone. This translated into a trend toward prolonged time-to-failure for mice in the combination treatment group. In conclusion, PI3K inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of glioblastomas, especially when used in combination with ionizing radiation.",Excluded
626,"Superoxide dismutase (sod-1) null mutants of Neurospora crassa: oxidative stress sensitivity, spontaneous mutation rate and response to mutagens Enzymatic superoxide-dismutase activity is believed to be important in defense against the toxic effects of superoxide. Although superoxide dismutases are among the best studied proteins, numerous questions remain concerning the specific biological roles of the various superoxide-dismutase types. In part, this is because the proposed damaging effects of superoxide are manifold, ranging from inactivation of certain metabolic enzymes to DNA damage. Studies with superoxide-deficient mutants have proven valuable, but surprisingly few such studies have been reported. We have constructed and characterized Neurospora crassa mutants that are null for sod-1, the gene that encodes copper-zinc superoxide dismutase. Mutant strains are sensitive to paraquat and elevated oxygen concentrations, and they exhibit an increased spontaneous mutation rate. They appear to have near wild-type sensitive to near- and far-UV, heat shock and gamma-irradiation. Unlike the equivalent Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant and the sodA sodB double mutant of Escherichia coli, they do not exhibit aerobic auxotrophy. These results are discussed in the context of an attempt to identify consensus phenotypes among superoxide dismutase-deficient mutants. N. crassa sod-1 null mutant strains were also employed in genetic and subcellular fractionation studies. Results support the hypothesis that a single gene (sod-1), located between Fsr-12 and leu-3 on linkage group I, is responsible for most or all CuZn superoxide dismutase activity in this organism.",Excluded

69,"Electroretinographic Assessment of Inner Retinal Signaling in the Isolated and Superfused Murine Retina PURPOSE: Longer-lasting electroretinographic recordings of the isolated murine retina were initially achieved by modification of a phosphate-buffered nutrient solution originally developed for the bovine retina. During experiments with a more sensitive mouse retina, apparent model-specific limitations were addressed and improvements were analyzed for their contribution to an optimized full electroretinogram (ERG).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retinas were isolated from dark-adapted mice, transferred to a recording chamber and superfused with different solutions. Scotopic and photopic ERGs were recorded with white flashes every 3 minutes. The phosphate buffer (Sickel-medium) originally used was replaced by a carbonate-based system (Ames-medium), the pH of which was adjusted to 7.7-7.8. Moreover, addition of 0.1 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub> was investigated to reduce b-wave contamination by the slow PIII component typically present in the murine ERG.RESULTS: B-wave amplitudes were increased by the pH-shift (pH 7.4 to pH 7.7) from 22.9 +/- 1.9 microV to 37.5 +/- 2.5 microV. Improved b-wave responses were also achieved by adding small amounts of Ba<sup>2+</sup> (100 microM), which selectively suppressed slow PIII components, thereby unmasking more of the true b-wave amplitude (100.0% with vs. 22.2 +/- 10.7% without Ba<sup>2+</sup>). Ames medium lacking amino acids and vitamins was unable to maintain retinal signaling, as evident in a reversible decrease of the b-wave to 31.8 +/- 3.9% of its amplitude in complete Ames medium.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide optimized conditions for ex vivo ERGs from the murine retina and suggest that careful application of Ba<sup>2+</sup> supports reliable isolation of b-wave responses in mice. Under our recording conditions, murine retinas show reproducible ERGs for up to six hours.",Excluded
682,"Skin denervation, neuropathology, and neuropathic pain in a laser-induced focal neuropathy Small-diameter sensory nerves innervating the skin are responsive to noxious stimuli, and an injury to these nerves is presumably related to neuropathic pain. Injury-induced neuropathic pain in animals can be produced by laser irradiation, which usually requires concomitant use of photosensitive dyes, known as the photochemical approach. It is not clear whether laser irradiation alone can induce neuropathic pain. In addition, two issues are important to apply these approaches: the relationship between the extent of laser irradiation and the occurrence of neuropathic pain, and the susceptibility of small-diameter sensory nerves in the skin to laser-induced neuropathic pain. To address these issues, we designed a new model of focal neuropathy by applying a diode laser of 532 nm (100 mW) to the sciatic nerve and evaluated small-diameter nerves by quantifying skin innervation and large-diameter nerves by measuring amplitudes of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP). Immediately after laser irradiation, epineurial vessels were occluded due to the formation of thrombi, and the blood flow through these vessels was markedly reduced. On postoperative day (POD) 2, animals developed characteristic manifestations of neuropathic pain, including spontaneous pain behaviors, thermal hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia. These phenomena peaked during PODs 7-21, and lasted for 3-6 weeks. The neuropathology at the irradiated site of the sciatic nerve included a focal area of axonal degeneration surrounded by demyelination and endoneurial edema. The extent of damage to large-diameter motor and sensory nerves after laser irradiation was evaluated by nerve conduction studies. On the irradiated sides, amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were reduced to 65.0% (P < 0.0001) and 42.5% (P < 0.01) of those on the control sides, respectively. Motor innervation of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) on plantar muscles was examined by combined cholinesterase histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. The ratio of innervated NMJs on the operated sides decreased to 76.3% of that on the control side. Skin innervation in the territory of the irradiated sciatic nerves was evaluated by immunohistochemistry with neuronal markers. Among these markers, epidermal nerve densities for protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P (SP) were significantly lower on the irradiated sides than the control sides with a different degree of loss for each marker (42.1-53.1%, P < 0.05). Results suggest that laser-induced focal neuropathy provides a new system for studying neuropathic pain. With this approach, the extent of nerve injury can be quantified. Both small-diameter epidermal nerves and large-diameter sensory and motor nerves are susceptible to laser-induced injury of different degrees.",Excluded
781,"Paraventricular hypothalamic influences on spinal nociceptive processing Oxytocin properties have been studied in different experimental models in order to obtain evidence for its analgesic properties. The analgesic effect of an oxytocinergic pathway descending from the hypothalamus reaching the dorsal horn of the spinal cord has been studied. In anesthetized rats, we recorded single units at the L4-L5 spinal dorsal horn level and stimulated the peripheral receptive field. The evoked responses were classified according to their latencies in A-beta, A-delta, C fibers, and postdischarge. We used these responses to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation of the paraventricular nucleus (PV) of the hypothalamus. We observed a selective blockage of A-delta and C fibers related to the duration of the train stimulus duration. Similar effects were observed when oxytocin (OT) was applied directly on the spinal cord. The effects of OT and of PV electrical stimulation were reversed in a dose-dependent manner by application of the specific OT antagonist (OTA). These effects were observed in cells with reduced wind-up and cells displaying a clear wind-up response to peripheral stimulation. Superficial and deeper cells in the dorsal spinal cord were involved. The recorded cells were marked by pontamine blue iontophoretic injection after each cell recording, and their histological locations were specified. In order to obtain a behavioral correlation, we used rats with a loose ligature of the sciatic nerve and a chronic intrathecal catheter reaching the L4-L5 spinal cord level. We tested the hyperalgesia and allodynia of these animals using von Frey filaments and the application of acetone to the hind paws. Our results show a significant reduction in the mechanical and thermal test after the administration of 15 microl of 10(-6) M OT. Our electrophysiological, pharmacological, and behavioral results point out a clear OT antialgesic effect. The results are discussed on the basis of a previous work showing an OT blockage of glutamate activation.

This study was conducted for the evaluation of the cytogenetic effects of 153Sm-EDTMP in blood lymphocytes from patients with bone metastases (without previous radio or chemotherapy), using the chromosome aberration technique. The degree of cytological damage found in in vivo blood cells of patients was compared with those found in in vitro in an adjusted dose-response curve. Blood samples were collected before and 1 hr after the administration of 153Sm-EDTMP(about 42.31 MBq/kg). The frequency of structural chromosome aberration per cell observed in 1 hr samples (0.054+/-0.035 CA/cell) was higher than basal ones (0.031+/-0.026 CA/cell), although this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.101). For in vitro assay, blood samples were exposed to different concentrations of 153Sm-EDTMP, during 1 hr (0.37-1.11 MBq/ml).

Introduction: Lung cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies; however, no serum marker has been routinely recommended until now. Method(s): This is a prospective case control study including two groups of patients: Group Ipatients with advanced lung cancer and Group IIpatients with benign lung disease as control. Serum cytokeratin 19 (CK19) fragment levels were measured at baseline by real-time polymerase chain reaction before first-line chemotherapy. The CK19 cut-off taken was 15-cycle threshold. The primary end point was the comparison of high CK19 in cases and controls. The secondary end point was the correlation between high CK19 and progressive disease (PD), progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) in advanced lung cancer patients. Result(s): A total of 30 patients with advanced lung cancer (16 non-small and 14 small cell lung cancer) and 15 patients with benign lung disease were included and followed up during the period from October 2008 to October 2011 with median follow-up of one and half years. High CK19 was found in 90% of lung cancer cases as compared with 7% in controls (p < 0.001). High CK19 was found in all cases showing PD (p = 0.04). One-year OS in high CK was 61% as compared with 33% in normal CK (p = 0.1).

36,"Radiosurgical ablation of spinal cord AVM Objective: Intramedullary spinal cord arteriovenous malformations (AVMs ) are very rare lesions which are characteristically associated with recurrent hemorrhage and progressive ischemia. Although favorable location, size and vascular anatomy make it sometimes possible to manage this condition with embolization and/or microsurgical resection, there are no good treatment options for many, if not most, of these lesions. Given such poor prospects, the senior author began in 1997 investigating Cy-berKnife radiosurgical ablation as a tool for managing selected patients with intramedullary spinal cord AVMs. Although a previous paper in 2006 reported the preliminary experience from Stanford, our understanding has grown significantly as follow-up was extended and more patients were treated. Herein, we retrospectively analyze our longer term experience with a primary radiosurgical approach to spinal cord AVM. Method(s): Thirty patients (17 females: 13 males) with a median age of 33 years and intramedullary spinal cord AVMs (18 cervical, 9 thoracic, and three conus medullaris) were treated with CyberKnife SRS between 1997 and 2008. A history of hemorrhage was present in 57% of cases, while in 50% of patients previous treatment included microsurgery (6/29) or embolization (11/29). The mean AVM volume was 2.8 cc (0.2-15cc) was treated to mean marginal dose of 20Gy in one to four sessions (median 2). Based on our growing experience, the biologically effective dose (BED) of radiation was escalated gradually over the course of this study. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up were carried out annually, and spinal angiography was repeated at 3 years. Result(s): After a mean follow-up period of 63 months (median 54), the treated AVM was completely obliterated in 8 cases (27%) and significantly decreased in size in an additional 11 cases (64%) among the 22 angiographically studied patients with more than 3 years of follow-up. Pre-radiosurgery neurologic symptoms improved in more than 50% of cases, but worsened in three (10%). There was one instance (3%) of radiation-induced myelopathy occurring within one year of radiosurgery. Notably, after 158 years of collective post SRS follow-up, no patient suffered a hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): Although our understanding is still incomplete, CyberKnife radiosurgery Results in total obliteration or shrinkage for most intramedullary spinal cord AVM, a phenomenon that may beaccompanied by a marked decrease in the risk of bleeding. Symptom improvement is also common in most cases. More experience is required to determine the optimal radiosurgical dosing and consequent related efficacy. Given the significant therapeutic challenges inherent to spinal cord AVM patients, the rate of radiosurgical complications appears acceptable.",Excluded
1009,"Illumination controls differentiation of dopamine neurons regulating behaviour Specification of the appropriate neurotransmitter is a crucial step in neuronal differentiation because it enables signalling among populations of neurons. Experimental manipulations demonstrate that both autonomous and activity-dependent genetic programs contribute to this process during development, but whether natural environmental stimuli specify transmitter expression in a neuronal population is unknown. We investigated neurons of the ventral suprachiasmatic nucleus that regulate neuroendocrine pituitary function in response to light in teleosts, amphibia and primates. Here we show that altering light exposure, which changes the sensory input to the circuit controlling adaptation of skin pigmentation to background, changes the number of neurons expressing dopamine in larvae of the amphibian Xenopus laevis in a circuit-specific and activity-dependent manner. Neurons newly expressing dopamine then regulate changes in camouflage colouration in response to illumination. Thus, physiological activity alters the numbers of behaviourally relevant amine-transmitter-expressing neurons in the brain at postembryonic stages of development. The results may be pertinent to changes in cognitive states that are regulated by biogenic amines.",Excluded
656,"Treatment of posterior pelvic ring disruptions using a minimally invasive adjustable plate OBJECTIVE: Iliosacral (IS) screw fixation and posterior tension band plate (TBP) technique are two treatment alternatives for posterior pelvic ring injuries. However, IS screw fixation requires continuous fluoroscopic guidance for appropriate screw insertion and carries a risk of neurovascular injuries. TBP technique also has some disadvantages, including limited reduction potential, difficulty in precontouring the plate and a higher rate of symptomatic implants. To address these limitations, we introduced a minimally invasive adjustable plate (MIAP). This study aims to present the preliminary radiological and clinical results of posterior pelvic ring disruptions treated with MIAP.METHODS: The MIAP conforms to the irregular shape of posterior pelvic ring and can be used without prebending. This plate has a role in reducing compressed or separated fractures/dislocations. Sixteen patients, including seven males and nine females, were treated with MIAP through a minimally invasive approach. The fracture patterns consisted of six Type B and ten Type C fractures according to OTA classification of fracture. Preoperative and postoperative radiography was taken to assess the fracture displacement and reduction quality. Postoperative rehabilitation programme was individualised and early exercise was encouraged. Patients were followed up and the functional outcome was evaluated based upon the scoring system proposed by Lindahl and associates.RESULTS: All posterior pelvic ring disruptions were reduced and fixed with MIAP. The average duration of surgery was 49 min, the average radiation exposure was 6s, and the average blood loss was 80 mL for the treatment of posterior pelvic ring injuries. Overall radiological results of the reduction were excellent in eleven patients and good in five. The patients were followed up for 30 months on average. All fractures healed. The functional outcome was excellent in ten patients, good in four and fair in two. There were no iatrogenic neurovascular injuries, implant failures, irritative symptoms or pressure sores due to subcutaneous implantation.CONCLUSION: Favourable clinical and radiological outcomes can be achieved in treating posterior pelvic disruptions with MIAP. This plate is effective in view of its simplicity, less radiation exposure, safety, minimal invasion and stable fixation.",Excluded
331,"Dexamethasone-related adrenal insufficiency in patients with brain and skull base tumours Purpose or Objective This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in a cohort of patients with brain and skull base tumours and to identify factors which may predict its occurrence. Material and Methods Patients with brain or skull base tumours attending for a short synacthen test (SST) at a single institution between October 2010 and January 2014 were retrospectively identified. Baseline demographics and dexamethasone exposure was scrutinised. Fisher's Exact, Student's ttest, Mann-Whitney and the Kendall's tau-b were used to evaluate differences between patients who passed or failed the SST. Results Thirty-one of 51 patients with previous dexamethasone exposure failed their first SST (61%). Duration of and total exposure to dexamethasone was significantly different between pass and fail groups (p=0.001 and p=0.007 respectively). No significant relationship was demonstrated between age, gender, diagnosis or mean pituitary radiation dose and SST results. Receiver operator characteristic curves generated suggest both duration of and total exposure to dexamethasone are acceptable discriminators when predicting SST failure. These curves generate values of 78 days and 171 milligram days respectively with optimum sensitivity (i.e. ability to detect SST failures.) Conclusion These values may be used clinically to identify patients at higher risk of adrenal suppression who require empirical hydrocortisone pending formal testing of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",Excluded

979,"Modulating effects of on-line low frequency electromagnetic fields on hippocampal long-term potentiation in young male Sprague-Dawley rat The low frequency electromagnetic fields (LF-EMFs) are attracting more attention and studied deeply because of their effects on human health and biology. Recent reports indicate that exposure of rats to LF-EMFs induces persistent changes in neuronal activity. The studies used the following standard methods: the rats or rat brain slices were first stimulated in an external electromagnetic exposure system, and then moved to a patch clamp perfusion chamber to record electrophysiological characteristics (off-line magnetic exposure). However, this approach is susceptible to many disturbances, such as the effects of brain slice movements. In this paper, we describe a novel patch-clamp setup which is modified to allow accurate on-line LF-EMFs stimulation. We performed the computational simulations of the stimulation coils to describe the uniformity of the distribution of the on-line magnetic field. The 0.5, 1, 2 mT magnetic field of 15 Hz, 50 Hz, and 100 Hz was produced and applied to slices to study the effect of LF-EMFs on synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that the slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) decreased significantly under the priming on-line uninterrupted or pulsed sinusoidal LF-EMFs stimulation. In the present study, we investigated whether LF-EMFs can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in male Sprague-Dawley rat hippocampal slices in vitro. Interestingly, these results highlight the role of 100 Hz pulsed sinusoidal LF-EMFs only as a modulator, rather than an LTP inducer.",Excluded
1097,"The role of functional imaging in the diagnosis and management of late normal tissue injury Normal tissue injury after radiation therapy (RT) can be defined based on either clinical symptoms or laboratory/radiologic tests. In the research setting, functional imaging (eg, single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], positron-emission tomography [PET], and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is useful because it provides objective quantitative data such as metabolic activity, perfusion, and soft-tissue contrast within tissues and organs. For RT-induced lung, heart, and parotid gland injury, pre- and post-RT SPECT images can be compared with the dose- and volume-dependent nature of regional injury. In the brain, SPECT can detect changes in perfusion and blood flow post-RT, and PET can detect metabolic changes, particularly to regions of the brain that have received doses above 40 to 50 Gy. On MRI, changes in contrast-enhanced images, T(1) and T(2) relaxation times, and pulmonary vascular resistance at different intervals pre- and post-RT show its ability to detect and distinguish different phases of radiation pneumonitis. Similarly, conventional and diffusion-weighted MRI can be used to differentiate between normal tissue edema, necrosis, and tumor in the irradiated brain, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy can measure changes in compounds, indicative of membrane and neuron disruption. The use of functional imaging is a powerful tool for early detection of RT-induced normal tissue injury, which may be related to long-term clinically significant injury. [References: 89]",Excluded
1183,"Radiotherapy and radiosurgical management of brain metastases Out of the various cancer treatment modalities available, radiotherapy is the most commonly used for managing metastatic disease in the brain. Until recent years, this was almost exclusively limited to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Radiosurgery has emerged as a powerful technique for controlling small to moderate-sized brain metastases (<4 cm in diameter). Tumor control rates with radiosurgery are superior to those with WBRT and appear to equal or surpass those with surgery plus WBRT in most studies. The choice among various radiation management strategies (radiosurgery alone, radiosurgery plus WBRT, or surgery followed by radiotherapy) should be based on the size and location of the brain metastases, the functional and neurologic status of the patient, the type of tumor, the tumor imaging characteristics, and the patient's concerns about the risks and side effects of the proposed treatment.

Monomers and small oligomers of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, players in Alzheimer's disease, are recently suggested to be involved in damaging of neurons, instead of extracellular Abeta plaques. We demonstrate that externally applied disaggregated Abeta<sub>1-42</sub> peptide interacts preferentially with acidic compartments (lysosomes). We compared standard cell cultivation (21% O<sub>2</sub>) to more physiological cell cultivation (5% O<sub>2</sub>). Cells did not exhibit a dramatic increase in ROS and change in glutathione level upon 4 muM Abeta peptide treatment, whereas exposure to 2 Gy X-rays increased ROS and changed glutathione level and ATP concentration. The occurrence of the 4977 bp deletion in mtDNA and significant protein carbonylation were specific effects of IR and more pronounced at 21% O<sub>2</sub>. An increase in cell death after Abeta peptide treatment or irradiation was unexpectedly restored to the control level or below when both were combined, particularly at 5% O<sub>2</sub>.

After IV administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, an extra-axial, highly contrast-enhanced mass in the brainstem, cerebellar herniation, and syringohydromyelia were detected via MRI. The dog was treated with corticosteroids and radiation therapy of the mass for 4 weeks (total dose, 42.5 Gy). Magnetic resonance imaging was repeated 9 weeks and 6 months after radiation therapy; compared with the initial findings, a reduction in the size of the brainstem mass was observed in both MRI scans. The third MRI scan also revealed a normal cerebellar shape, no evidence of herniation, and resolution of syringohydromyelia in the dog at that time. It is recommended that whenever syringohydromyelia is observed via MRI, a primary cause (cranial or caudal to the affected region) should be sought.",Excluded
251,"Evaluating the influence of setup uncertainties on treatment planning for focal liver tumors PURPOSE: A mechanism has been developed to evaluate the influence of random setup variations on dose during treatment planning. The information available for studying these factors shifts from population-based models toward patient-specific data as treatment progresses and setup measurements for an individual patient become available. This study evaluates the influence of population as well as patient-specific setup distributions on treatment plans for focal liver tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients with focal liver tumors were treated on a protocol that involved online setup measurement and adjustment, as well as ventilatory immobilization. Summary statistics from these three-dimensional conformal treatments yielded individual and population distributions of position at initial setup for each fraction. A convolution model for evaluation of the influence of random setup variation on calculated dose distributions has been previously described and investigated for application to focal liver radiotherapy by our department. Individual patient doses based on initial setup positions were calculated by convolving the calculated dose distribution with an anisotropic probability distribution function representing the individual patient's random variations. A separate convolution using population-averaged random variations was performed. Individual beam apertures were then adjusted to provide plans that ensured proper dose to the clinical target volume following convolution with population distributions, as well as individual patient position uncertainty models.RESULTS: Individual patient setup distributions for the course of treatment had random setup variations (sigma) that ranged from 2.5 to 5.7 mm (left-right), 2.1 to 8.3 mm (anterior-posterior), and 4.1 to 10.8 mm (cranial-caudal). The population random components were 4.2 mm (left-right), 4.1 mm (anterior-posterior), and 7.0 mm (cranial-caudal) at initial setup. The initial static planned dose distribution overestimated the volume of liver irradiated to high doses, because inclusion of setup uncertainties generally blurred the resulting doses, shifting the higher-dose region of normal liver dose-volume histograms to lower doses. Furthermore, the population-based dose convolution tended to predict a higher risk of radiation damage to the liver (based on an in-house parameterization of the Lyman normal tissue complication probability model) than the individual patient calculations. For an individual plan, application of different individual random variations yielded change in effective volume differences with a 3% range. Plan adjustment to account for random setup variations generally resulted in a lower change in effective volume than initial planning using a planning target volume followed by calculation of delivered dose based on random offsets.CONCLUSION: This study hints at the factors that most strongly influence planning of liver treatments taking into account geometric variations. Given a setup verification methodology that rapidly reduces systematic offsets, the importance of realistic incorporation of geometric variations as an initial step in treatment planning, as well as possible plan refinement, is demonstrated.",Excluded
553,"A randomized phase II clinical trial of whole-brain radiation therapy plus concomitant temozolomide in treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer: Six-month follow-up results Background: Despite of therapeutics progress in advanced breast cancer, brain metastases occurrence remain a frequent and delicate situation. The efficacy of whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), still considered as the standard local treatment in case of multiple brain metastases, is limited. Recently, several phase II studies have shown some efficacy of the association of WBRT and temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent already known as a radiosensitizer, with improved brain control rate (44 to 96%). Patients with breast cancer were underrepresented and none of these trials have studied this combined treatment issue in this specific population. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of WBRT combined with temozolomide in the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective randomized multicenter phase II study was developed, using a modified two-stage Fleming design. Patients with newly diagnosed intraparenchymal brain metastases from breast cancer, not suitable for surgery nor radiosurgery, were included. All patients received conformational WBRT (3 Gy x 10 to 30 Gy). They were randomized to WBRT plus concomitant TMZ administered 75 mg/m2/day during radiation period versus WBRT alone. The primary endpoint was radiologic objective response at six weeks after the end of treatment, defined as a partial or complete response on systematic brain MRI (WHO modified criteria). We also evaluated neurologic symptoms, tolerance, safety, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as secondary endpoints. A longer clinical-brain MRI follow-up was planned, each three months during a two-year period. All of the patients gave their written informed consent to be part of the study, which was approved by the local committee. Result(s): One hundred patients were enrolled between February 2008 and December 2010 (50 in the WBRT + TMZ arm, 50 in the WBRT arm). The median age was 55 [29 -79]. Eighty (80) patients had brain metastases as single secondary localization. About one third of patients had a triple negative breast cancer subtype (38,3% in the association arm and 35,71% in the WBRT alone arm). There were 26,7% and 14,6% of HER2 positive subtype respectively. The median follow-up was 30 months [range 6-60]. At six months from brain metastases diagnosis (three months after the end of the treatment), objective response rate seems better in the WBRT + TMZ arm: 52% versus 40% in the arm WBRT alone but was not statistically significant (p = 0,54). No complete response was observed. In the WBRT + TMZ group, median PFS and OS at six-months were respectively 55,6% [range 46-7 - 66,0] and 67,7% [range 59,1 - 77,6]. No improvement in neurologic symptoms was noticed. In multivariate analysis, initial TNM status was significantly correlated with PFS and OS. The concurrent use of TMZ with WBRT was well-tolerated. The most frequent upper grade II acute toxicity was reversible leucopenia in the association arm. Conclusion(s): The addition of temozolomide to WBRT in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer did not improve local control or survival at six months follow-up.",Excluded

Cytogenetic studies have revealed a human karyotype with several chromosomal abnormalities. Genetic analysis by in situ DNA hybridization has demonstrated the presence of multiple copies of the N-myc gene. Approximately 20-30 fold amplification of the gene is observed on Southern blot analysis. The cell line has been adapted to growth as multicellular tumour spheroids as well as monolayer culture. Radiobiological studies on spheroids show the cells to be radiosensitive with low capacity for sub-lethal damage accumulation and repair.

743,"Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007 What do we currently know about the occupational and environmental causes of cancer? As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know.

Our aim was to assess the acceptability of a dedicated, special-purpose sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction-based ultra-low-dose CT protocol for neurosurgical intensive care unit surveillance head CT examinations, comparing image quality with studies performed with our standard-of-care sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction low-dose CT and legacy filtered back-projection standard-dose CT protocols.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 54 head CT examinations: ultra-low-dose CT (n = 22), low-dose CT (n = 12), and standard-dose CT (n = 20) in 22 patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. Standard-dose CT was reconstructed by using filtered back-projection on a Somatom Sensation 64 scanner. Ultra-low-dose CT and ultra-low-dose CT examinations were performed on a Siemens AS+128 scanner with commercially available sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative parameters, including image quality and dose, were evaluated.RESULTS: Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction ultra-low-dose CT represented a 68% lower dose index volume compared with filtered back-projection standard-dose CT techniques in the same patients while maintaining similar quality and SNR levels. Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction low-dose CT offered higher image quality than filtered back-projection standard-dose CT (P < .05) with no differences in SNR at a 24% lower dose index volume. Compared with low-dose CT, ultra-low-dose CT had significantly lower SNR (P = .001) but demonstrated clinically satisfactory measures of image quality.CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit, dedicated ultra-low-dose CT for surveillance head CT imaging led to a significant dose reduction while maintaining adequate image quality.",Excluded

Method(s):Review of an advances in the broad field of biochirality connecting two poles of the phenomena: the atomic orbitals and the brain's cognitive function. Result(s): The chain of chirality transfer in the living organism hierarchical structure consisting of several distinct levels. The set of these levels includes the chirality transfer of following types: From the elementary particle to atomic orbital level. From the atomic orbital to the molecular level. From the molecular to supramolecular and macro-molecular levels. From the molecular to the cellular level. From the cellular to morphological level. From the morphological level to the functional level. Conclusion(s): The striking similarity in the chirality-related effects within a broad class of molecular, cellular, and morphological structures inspired researchers in many fields of stereochemistry and neuroscience. This advance in the current results suggests the fundamental significance of molecular chirality in biological transport, neuro-development, sensory perception, motor behavior, brain cognitive functions, human psychology, and psychiatry. The helical structures of the proteins are known to be the consequence of amino acid chirality. The helicity of proteins, in turn, provides an opportunity for chiral biological macromolecular systems with higher hierarchical levels of symmetry and yet unknown functions. The hierarchy of chirality transfer, evident particularly from the current review, possesses several not trivial features. Each of the consequently-following hierarchical levels is contributed to from the complex power of all lower levels. Each level has its own quasi-independent internal and external determinants. The majority of the external determinants exhibit a chiral nature. As such, the chirality of external determinants is a critical factor in the evolution and development of the organism. The fundamental nature of chirality transfer should be considered in experimental design strategy in neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and pharmacology. Molecular chirality is a promising landmark in the search of reliable biomarkers in the spectrum of the disease conditions including neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.",Excluded

Radiation therapy (RT) has proven effective in bone (BM) and brain (BrM) metastases. The objective of this study was to analyze the variability of RT utilization rates in clinical practice and the accessibility to medical technology in our region.Patients and methods: We reviewed the clinical records and RT treatment sheets of all patients undergoing RT for BM and/or BrM during 2007 in the 12 public hospitals in an autonomous region of Spain. Data were gathered on hospital type, patient type and RT treatment characteristics. Calculation of the rate of RT use was based on the cancer incidence and the number of RT treatments for BM, BrM and all cancer sites. Result(s): Out of the 9319 patients undergoing RT during 2007 for cancer at any site, 1242 (13.3%; inter-hospital range, 26.3%) received RT for BM (n = 744) or BrM (n = 498). These 1242 patients represented 79% of all RT treatments with palliative intent, and the most frequent primary tumours were in lung, breast, prostate or digestive system. No significant difference between BM and BrM groups were observed in: mean age (62 vs. 59 yrs, respectively); gender (approximately 64% male and 36% female in both); performance status (ECOG 0-1 in 70 vs. 71%); or mean distance from hospital (36 vs. 28.6 km) or time from consultation to RT treatment (13 vs. 14.3 days). RT regimens differed among hospitals and between patient groups: 10 x 300 cGy, 5 x 400 cGy and 1x800cGy were applied in 32, 27 and 25%, respectively, of BM patients, whereas 10 x 300cGy was used in 49% of BrM patients. Conclusion(s): Palliative RT use in BM and BrM is high and close to the expected rate, unlike the global rate of RT application for all cancers in our setting.

The measurements were made in a geometry used for irradiation of intracranial lesions. For radii less than 1.0 cm the dose on the central axis is progressively reduced due to electron disequilibrium. This leads to measurement artifacts when the detector is too large, as was readily observed with ionization chambers. Radiographic and radiochromic films were used with densitometric evaluation to provide the resolution necessary to measure absorbed doses for the narrowest beams. The contribution by phantom-scattered photons is significant even at small field sizes, and scatter factors were determined from the experimental results.

1138,"The role of edema in diffuse sclerosis and other leukoencephalopathies The pathologic changes associated with broad zones of demyelination of the cerebral white matter, the diffuse sclerosis group, are analyzed with respect to the contribution of cerebral edema to their pathogenesis. The characteristics of cerebral edema in general are reviewed, and the interpretation offered that only one type of cerebral edema, that characterized by an extracellular accumulation of fluid, occurs in man. In the diffuse sclerosis group, edema is most readily recognized by the tendency for the arcuate zone of white matter to be spared when the deeper white matter is severely degenerated. Edema is demonstrated in metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, disorders of amino acid metabolism, trauma, hypertensive disease, radiation effect, diffuse hypoxia with acidosis, and other conditions, i.e., both in disorders of myelin metabolism and in conditions in which normal myelin is injured by extrinsic influences. These groups cannot be consistently distinguished morphologically, in part because the injury by edema often obscures any primary morphologic change which may have been present. A familial tendency does not necessarily denote a metabolic abnormality specifically related to the chemistry of a myelin constituent, since the lesions might result from edema induced by some other type of familial process. Such familial processes might be metabolic, but are not specifically related to myelin formation or catabolism, as might be true of diseases like phenylketonuria or maple syrup urine disease. Edema may also occur in instances in which a familial disease induces diffuse hypoxia and acidosis, as exemplified by two instances of severe white matter degeneration in subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy; one of these is an additional instance of apparent 'crib death' by this cause.",Excluded
815,"Distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells in X-irradiated rats. An electrophysiological study 1. The distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells has been studied with intracellular recordings in X-irradiated and normal rats. 2. In the treated rats, multiple steps in the post-synaptic potential were elicited in 57% of the Purkinje cells by graded stimulation of the climbing fibres, the response was all-or-none in character in the other cells and in all Purkinje cells recorded in normal animals. In the neurones exhibiting the former type of response, no collision was seen along the afferent fibres during interaction experiments between just-threshold juxtafastigial and maximal olivary stimulations, whereas a collision always occurred when all-or-none responses were recorded. 3. These results show that in X-irradiated rats, the majority of Purkinje cells have a multiple innervation by two to four climbing fibres, instead of the one-to-one relationship seen normally. 4. Input resistances and total electrotonic lengths of Purkinje cells were measured in normal and treated rats. Mean values for these two parameters were higher than normal in multiply innervated cells. 5. Mean time course and mean current for reversal of the post-synaptic potential elicited in Purkinje cells by stimulation of the climbing fibres were nearly the same in mono- and in multiply innervated neurones. In multiply innervated cells, time courses and currents for reversal were independent of the size of the response or varied slightly with it, suggesting that the climbing fibres involved innervated territories whose electrotonic distance from the recording site were either the same or slightly different. 6. Interactions between two all-or-none steps of the graded post-synaptic potential evoked in multiply innervated cells by juxtafastigial and olivary stimulations revealed either a very weak or a very marked shunting effect between synapses of the two climbing fibres involved. 7. These results indicate that the over-all distribution of climbing fibre synapses on multiply innervated Purkinje cells is not grossly abnormal and that two fibres contacting a given cell can be either intermingled on the same dendrites, or segregated on distinct dendritic branches. 8. In general, the present study does not suggest the existence of a strong competition among climbing fibres innervating each Purkinje cell during development at least when granule cells are absent.",Included

The gamma-irradiation affected the granule cells of the olfactory bulbs and differentially altered the cell layers of the subfields of the ammonic fields and the dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus. In the CA1 ammonic field, dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus, the cellular loss was significant in comparison with control adult rats. The behavioural data indicated that irradiated rats were deeply disturbed in learning the odour-reward association, and substantially impaired in a reversal experiment, but not in the discrimination of the odours per se. The cellular loss in the olfactory bulbs, in the CA1 and in the ventral blade of the gyrus dentatus was positively correlated with the deficit in behavioural performance. The data support the findings that the hippocampal system participates in the odour-reward associations and facilitates the long-term storage of associations after learning is achieved in this olfactory associative task.",Excluded
453,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for primary and metastatic sarcomas of the spine Purpose/Objective(s): The management of spinal or paraspinal sarcomas poses unique challenges. They have irregular borders making surgical resection difficult and require much higher doses of radiation to achieve a favorable clinical and radiographic response. Little research has been performed to determine the role of SRS in sarcomas of the spine. The goal of this institutional analysis is to evaluate the role of SRS in primary and metastatic spinal or paraspinal sarcomas. Materials/Methods: Patients with pathologically confirmed sarcomas that received spine SRS at our institution between June 2001 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed after obtaining IRB approval. EMRs of clinical exams, and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated. Post treatment pain control, neurological improvement, and radiographic tumor control were the primary endpoints of this study. Result(s): A total of 23 patients treated to 78 vertebral levels were included. The average age of the cohort was 57 years. 45% of the patients were male and 55% were female. 64% were Caucasian, 27% African American, and 9% were of other ethnicities. The median surgical dose was 18 Gy in a single fraction (range 10-20) prescribed to the 90% isodose line. Median follow-up time was 3 months. 14 patients were deceased with a median survival of 14.6 months. Leiomyosarcoma was the most common histology among the cohort with 9 patients. Other histologies included- Ewing's (3), osteosarcoma (2), neufibrosarcoma (2), liposarcoma (2), chondrosarcoma (1), hemangiopercytoma (1), rhabdomyoblastic anaplastic (1), spindle cell (1), and unspecified sarcoma(1). The average tumor volume was 53.12 cc (range 2.02-207.25cc). Overall pain response was 75% (25% partial & 50% complete relief). Pain was stable in 25% of the patients, and no pain progression was observed. Total neurological response was 25% (0% complete, 25% partial). 94% of the patients were neurologically stable or improved after treatment. In one patient (6%) a progressed neurological deficit was observed. Total radiographic response was 67% (0% complete, 29% partial, 38% stable). Local tumor progression was observed in 33% of the patients. One patient initially had a partial radiographic response that progressed after 10 months. Another patient was initially stable but experienced radiographic progression after three months. Eight vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) were noted, two of which may be attributed to SRS. No other adverse effects were observed. Conclusion(s): A total of 23 patients and 78 spinal levels were treated with SRS resulting in fairly good response rates for pain relief, neurologic improvement, and radiographic tumor response (75%, 25%, & 67% respectively). Our results indicate that SRS has a role in the treatment of primary and metastatic sarcomas of the spine. Using slightly higher doses may provide improved response rates.",Excluded
672,"Total-body PET: Maximizing sensitivity to create new opportunities for clinical research and patient care PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article, we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET.

919,"c-Fos expression in preoptic nuclei as a marker of sleep rebound in the rat Thermoregulation is known to interfere with sleep, possibly due to a functional interaction at the level of the preoptic area (POA). Exposure to low ambient temperature (T(a)) induces sleep deprivation, which is followed by sleep rebound after a return to laboratory T(a). As two POA subregions, the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) and the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), have been proposed to have a role in sleep-related processes, the expression of c-Fos and the phosphorylated form of the cAMP/Ca(2+)-responsive element-binding protein (P-CREB) was investigated in these nuclei during prolonged exposure to a T(a) of -10 degrees C and in the early phase of the recovery period. Moreover, the dynamics of the sleep rebound during recovery were studied in a separate group of animals. The results show that c-Fos expression increased in both the VLPO and the MnPO during cold exposure, but not in a specific subregion within the VLPO cluster counting grid (VLPO T-cluster). During the recovery, concomitantly with a large rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) rebound and an increase in delta power during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), c-Fos expression was high in both the VLPO and the MnPO and, specifically, in the VLPO T-cluster. In both nuclei, P-CREB expression showed spontaneous variations in basal conditions. During cold exposure, an increase in expression was observed in the MnPO, but not in the VLPO, and a decrease was observed in both nuclei during recovery. Dissociation in the changes observed between c-Fos expression and P-CREB levels, which were apparently subject to state-related non-regulatory modulation, suggests that the sleep-related changes observed in c-Fos expression do not depend on a P-CREB-mediated pathway.",Excluded
801,"Cognitive functions in survivors of primary central nervous system lymphoma BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) involves high-dose methotrexate-based (MTX) chemotherapy and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). This combined regimen prolongs patient survival, but also carries a substantial risk for delayed neurotoxicity particularly in the elderly. However, cognitive outcome evaluations have not been included in most clinical trials.OBJECTIVE: To assess cognitive functioning and quality of life in PCNSL survivors treated either with WBRT +/- MTX-based chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone.METHODS: Twenty-eight PCNSL patients in disease remission received a post-treatment baseline neuropsychological evaluation, and a subset of patients were available for an 8-month follow-up evaluation. Assessment of quality of life and extent of white matter disease on MRI were also performed.RESULTS: Patients displayed mild to moderate impairments across several cognitive domains. These were of sufficient severity to reduce quality of life in half of the patient sample. Comparisons according to treatment type revealed more pronounced cognitive impairment, particularly in the memory and attention/executive domains, among patients treated with WBRT +/- chemotherapy. Extent of white matter disease correlated with attention/executive, memory, and language impairment.CONCLUSIONS: PCNSL survivors treated with WBRT +/- chemotherapy displayed more pronounced cognitive dysfunction than patients treated with MTX-based chemotherapy alone.",Excluded
270,"Prospective analysis of patient-reported late toxicity following pelvic radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As late radiotherapy toxicity impacts negatively on the quality-of-life of cancer survivors and is often under reported, a study was set up to prospectively collect patient-reported data in an unselected series of patients with gynaecological malignancy. Aim 1 - To provide 3 year results for the longitudinal study. Aim 2 - To improve the questionnaire used to collect data by identifying redundant items and modifying for use to collect Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) data.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Aim 1 - Patient reported outcome data were collected prospectively by 226 patients before and up to 3 years following radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer using a questionnaire developed to collect LENT subjective data. Aim 2 - A factor analysis was performed to identify which questions gave the most and least information.RESULTS: Aim 1 - Faecal urgency and incontinence (all grades) peaked at 79% and 24%, respectively at 1 year then settled to 69% and 18% at 3 years, respectively. Urinary urgency (all grades) increased with time and was described in 75% at 3 years. Other symptoms reported at 3 years include diarrhoea in 12%, urinary incontinence in 27% and vaginal dryness in 29%. A third of patients did not feel their sex life had changed following treatment, while a quarter felt that it had. Aim 2 - some questions overlapped and others were non-specific. The questionnaire has subsequently been altered.CONCLUSIONS: The extent of late toxicity is substantial. This detailed information is important for both patients and clinicians in terms of treatment decisions and follow-up care. The LENT questionnaire provides a feasible tool for capture of this information in the clinic.",Excluded
1064,"Neuroprotective effect of EGb761 and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation in a rat model of Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. The present study was undertaken to investigate the pretreatment effects of standardized Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation on the neurological dysfunction in the reserpine model of PD. Male Wistar rats were pretreated orally with EGb761 or fractionated low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation or their combination, then subjected to intraperitoneal injection of reserpine (5 mg/kg body weight) 24 h after the final dose of EGb761 or radiation. Reserpine injection resulted in the depletion of striatal dopamine (DA) level, increased catalepsy score, increased oxidative stress indicated via depletion of glutathione (GSH), increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and iron levels, decreased DA metabolites metabolizing enzymes; indicated by inhibition by glutathione-S-transferase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO) activities, mitochondrial dysfunction; indicated by declined complex I activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and increased apoptosis; indicated by decreased mitochondrial B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein level and by transmission electron microscope. EGb761 and low-dose gamma-radiation ameliorated the reserpine-induced state of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in brain. It can be concluded that EGb761, a widely used herbal medicine and low dose of gamma-irradiation have protective effects for combating Parkinsonism possibly via replenishment of GSH levels.

683,"Dosimetry after peptide receptor radionuclide therapy: impact of reduced number of post-treatment studies on absorbed dose calculation and on patient management Background: After each cycle of [<sup>177</sup>Lu]-DOTA-TATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) dosimetry is performed to enable precise calculation of the radiation-absorbed dose to tumors and normal organs. Absorbed doses are routinely calculated from three quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies corrected by computed tomography (CT) acquired at t<inf>1</inf> = 24 h, t<inf>2</inf> = 96 h, and t<inf>3</inf> = 168 h after the first cycle of treatment. After following cycles, a single SPECT/CT study is performed. The aim of the present study is to assess the feasibility of a ""two time point"" quantitative SPECT/CT protocol after the first PRRT cycle and its impact on patient management. Quantitative SPECT/CT data of 25 consecutive patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors after PRRT were retrospectively analyzed. Radiation-absorbed doses calculated using the standard protocol with three SPECT/CT studies acquired at (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>2</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>) were compared to those obtained from three different ""two time point"" protocols with SPECT/CT studies performed at (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>2</inf>), (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>), or (t<inf>2</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>). Result(s): The best agreement for the cumulative doses absorbed by the kidneys, bone marrow, liver, spleen, and tumors with the conventional protocol was obtained with the (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>) protocol with mean relative differences of - 1.0% +/- 2.4%, 0.4% +/- 3.1%, - 0.9% +/- 4.0%, - 0.8% +/- 1.1%, and - 0.5% +/- 2.0%, respectively, and correlation coefficients of r = 0.99 for all. In all patients, there was no difference in the management decision of whether or not to stop PRRT because of unsafe absorbed dose to risk organs using either the standard protocol or the (t<inf>1</inf>, t<inf>3</inf>) protocol. Conclusion(s): These preliminary results demonstrate that dosimetry calculations using two quantitative SPECT/CT studies acquired at 24 and 168 h after the first PRRT cycle are feasible and are in good agreement with the standard imaging protocol with no change in patient management decisions, while enabling improved patient comfort and reduced scanner and staff time.

235,"Synaptic and membrane properties of neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus Studies in intact rats have shown that the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) plays a key role in generating stress-induced physiologic changes, including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through direct projections to paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN). However, little is known about the cellular properties of DMH neurons. We employed whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques to characterize membrane properties and spontaneous post-synaptic currents (PSCs) in DMH neurons, including those projecting to PVN (identified by prior injection of DiI into PVN), in rat hypothalamic slices. DMH neurons (n=86 total) had uniform membrane properties. However, PVN-projecting neurons (n=32) had higher action potential (AP) thresholds, and fired fewer APs in response to current injection. Spontaneous PVN-projecting neurons (n=20) also fired APs at lower rates (4.8+/-0.6 Hz) than spontaneous neurons of unknown projection (n=38; 7.3+/-1.1 Hz). Spontaneous PSCs were observed in all neurons: One population expressed rapid decay characteristics (1.5-2.0 ms) and was blocked by non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists NBQX or CNQX. Remaining PSCs reversed near E(Cl), were blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonists picrotoxin or bicuculline methiodide (BMI), and had longer decay time constants (4.5-6.0 ms) that were modulated by pentobarbital. Tetrodotoxin markedly reduced the frequency of PSCs sensitive to NBQX but not to BMI. Thus, DMH is made up of electrophysiologically similar neurons and PVN-projecting neurons are less excitable than neurons of unknown projection. Furthermore, as suggested by studies in intact rats, neurons in the DMH, including those projecting to the PVN, are regulated by tonic GABA(A) and non-NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic transmission.",Excluded

The objective of this study was to develop a physiologically based method to evaluate the neurotoxic potential of drug candidates in vitro.

The rhodamine 123 signal in a defined region of fascicle was quantified and photobleached with the laser. A series of post-photobleach scans revealed the movement of fluorescent-labelled mitochondria into the bleached region from adjacent unbleached regions. Recovery of fluorescence is a measure of the size of the mobile pool of mitochondria relative to the total (moving plus stationary) pool. 3. The steady-state levels of fluorescence recovery was dependent on intracellular calcium and magnesium concentrations, energy status (ATP), and microtubule integrity (post taxol or vinblastine treatment). 4.

No marked increase in fetal mortality or growth retardation was observed below 0.25 Gy; the increase in these parameters was significant only at 0.50 Gy. A significant reduction in head size and brain weight and a significant increase in the incidence of microphthalmia were observed at doses above 0.15 Gy. Detectable levels of microcephaly and microphthalmia were evident even at 0.10 Gy. A linear dose response was seen for these effects in the dose range of 0.05 to 0.15 Gy.

The aim of this study was to present the outcomes of GKS in the largest group of patients with IVS studied to date, with particular emphasis on the long-term outcomes of treatment.METHODS: The study included 136 consecutive patients with unilateral IVS, who underwent GKS in 2011-2015. Mean age of the patients was 54 +/- 12.6 years. All patients were operated on with a 192-source cobalt-60 gamma knife unit. All patients had complete follow-up documentation and the mean duration of the follow-up was 52 +/- 13.8 months (6-83 months). Neurological status (facial and trigeminal nerve), hearing and instability/dizziness presence were determined prior to GKS, immediately after the procedure, and during the follow-up visits.RESULTS: Tumor growth control was obtained in 124/136 (~91.2%) patients. Hearing improvement was observed in 32/136 (23.5%) patients, and there was a distinct cluster of 9 patients (6.6%) regaining serviceable hearing after GKS, whereas in 36 patients (26.5%) was stable. Four patients developed facial nerve dysfunction, including 3 periodic hemifacial spasm and 1 partial paresis, which resolved spontaneously within 12 months of GKS. None of the operated patients showed new, debilitating neurological deficits, including trigeminal sensory disturbances or hydrocephalus.CONCLUSIONS: GKS is a highly effective treatment for IVS, associated with low morbidity and good tumor growth control.",Excluded

CW pain was assessed using the Common Toxicity Criteria for pain. Peripheral lung lesions were defined as those located within 2.5 cm of the CW. A minimal point dose of 20 Gy to the CW was required. The CW volume receiving >or=20, >or=30, >or=40, >or=50, and >or=60 Gy was determined and related to the risk of CW toxicity.RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 17 experienced Grade 3 CW pain and five rib fractures. The median interval to the onset of severe pain and/or fracture was 7.1 months. The risk of CW toxicity was fitted to the median effective concentration dose-response model. The CW volume receiving 30 Gy best predicted the risk of severe CW pain and/or rib fracture (R(2) = 0.9552). A volume threshold of 30 cm(3) was observed before severe pain and/or rib fracture was reported. A 30% risk of developing severe CW toxicity correlated with a CW volume of 35 cm(3) receiving 30 Gy.CONCLUSION: The development of CW toxicity is clinically relevant, and the CW should be considered an organ at risk in treatment planning. The CW volume receiving 30 Gy in three to five fractions should be limited to <30 cm(3), if possible, to reduce the risk of toxicity without compromising tumor coverage.",Excluded

Where clinicians recorded progression, ranked scales frequently did not alter (MRC 33%; WHO 30%) or occasionally improved (MRC 5%; WHO 3%). When analysing time to progression based on a variety of measures, the estimated difference between treatments was most extreme (hazard ratio 0.81, logrank p = 0.04) when change in WHO status was used, and least extreme when change in MRC neurological status was used (hazard ratio 0.99, p = 0.94).

However, little is known about the long-term effects of combined microgravity and low-dose radiation. We exposed mice to gamma radiation using a cobalt-57 plate (0.01 cGy/h for a total dose of 0.04 Gy), hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, or a combination of both for 3 weeks. Mice then underwent a behavioral test battery after 1 week, 1 month, 4 months, and 8 months to assess sensorimotor coordination/balance (rotarod), activity levels (open field), learned helplessness/depression-like behavior (tail suspension test), risk-taking (elevated zero maze), and spatial learning/memory (water maze). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression was assessed in the brain after behavioral testing to determine blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Mice that received unloading spent significantly more time in the exposed portions of the elevated zero maze, were hypoactive in the open field, and spent less time struggling on the tail suspension test than mice that did not receive unloading. Mice in the combination group expressed more AQP4 immunoactivity than controls. Elevated zero maze and AQP4 data were correlated. No differences were seen on the water maze or rotarod, and no radiation-only effects were observed. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to BBB dysfunction.",Included

353,"Radiotherapy for oligometastatic lung cancer Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) typically presents at an advanced stage, which is often felt to be incurable, and such patients are usually treated with a palliative approach. Accumulating retrospective and prospective clinical evidence, including a recently completed randomized trial, support the existence of an oligometastatic disease state wherein select individuals with advanced NSCLC may experience historically unprecedented prolonged survival with aggressive local treatments, consisting of radiotherapy and/or surgery, to limited sites of metastatic disease. This is reflected in the most recent AJCC staging subcategorizing metastatic disease into intra-thoracic (M1a), a single extra thoracic site (M1b), and more diffuse metastases (M1c). In the field of radiation oncology, recent technological advances have allowed for the delivery of very high, potentially ablative, doses of radiotherapy to both intra- and extra-cranial disease sites, referred to as stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy (or SABR), in much shorter time periods compared to conventional radiation and with minimal associated toxicity. At the same time, significant improvements in systemic therapy, including platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, molecular agents targeting oncogene-addicted NSCLC, and immunotherapy in the form of checkpoint inhibitors, have led to improved control of micro-metastatic disease and extended survival sparking newfound interest in combining these agents with ablative local therapies to provide additive, and in the case of radiation and immunotherapy, potentially synergistic, effects in order to further improve progression-free and overall survival. Currently, despite the tantalizing potential associated with aggressive local therapy in the setting of oligometastatic NSCLC, well-designed prospective randomized controlled trials sufficiently powered to detect and measure the possible added benefit afforded by this approach are desperately needed.

The plans were compared for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI), and doses to normal structures at 6 dose values from 50.4 Gy to 5.6 Gy. The mean CI was 1.75 (CF), 1.75 (DA), and 1.66 (IMRT) (p < 0.05 when comparing IMRT to either CF or DA plans). The CI (IMRT) was inversely proportional to the size of the PTV (Spearman's rho = -0.53, p = 0.01) and at PTV sizes above 25 cm3, the CI (IMRT) was always superior to CI (DA) and CI (CF). At PTV sizes below 25 cm3, there was no significant difference in CI between each technique. There was no significant difference in HI between plans. The total volume of normal tissue receiving 50.4, 44.8, and 5.6 Gy was significantly lower when comparing IMRT to CF and DA plans (p < 0.05). There was significantly improved dose sparing for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe with IMRT but no significant difference for the optic chiasm or pituitary gland. These results demonstrate that stereotactic IMRT should be considered to treat base-of-skull meningiomas with a PTV larger than 25 cm3, due to improved conformity and normal tissue sparing, in particular for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe.",Excluded

However, to enhance the controllability of this system, here we demonstrate the use of a computer controlled spatial light modulator (SLM) to steer and manipulate the shape of a laser beam for use in guided neuronal growth. This new experimental setup paves the way to enable a comprehensive investigation into beam shaping effects on neuronal growth and we show neuronal growth initiated by a Bessel light mode. This is a robust platform to explore the biochemistry of this novel phenomenon.",Excluded
465,"Evidence that peripheral rather than intracranial thermal signals induce thermoregulation Numerous effector mechanisms have been discovered, which change body temperature and thus serve to maintain the thermal integrity of homeothermic animals. These mechanisms are driven by thermal signals that are processed by neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area. To keep a tight control over body temperature, these neurons have to receive accurate thermal information. Although in vitro studies have shown the direct thermosensitive ability of neurons in the preoptic area, other observations suggest the existence of peripheral thermosensation and an ascending thermal pathway to the thermoregulatory center. Direct evidences for either one, or both are still missing. In the present study, brain, rectal, subcutaneous and skin surface temperatures were measured during 15, 30, 60 and 120 min of cold exposure (4 degrees C) in rats and compared with neuronal activation due to cold stress shown by c-fos in situ hybridization histochemistry. Subcutaneous and skin surface temperatures dropped continuously throughout the 120 min of cold exposure by 1.4 degrees C and 6.5 degrees C, respectively. However, during the first 30 min, brain and rectal temperatures increased by 0.3 degrees C and 0.25 degrees C, respectively, and even after 60 min of cold stress, brain temperature did not decrease under the level measured at 0 min. Since the brain temperature did not decrease, it is unlikely that intracranial thermoreceptors are involved in the transmission of ""cold"" thermal signal to induce thermoregulation. At 30 min of cold exposure, neurons in all known thermoregulatory areas (like the ventrolateral part of the medial preoptic nucleus, the lateral retrochiasmatic area, the lateral parabrachial nucleus and the peritrigeminal nucleus) were already maximally activated. These observations clearly indicate that the activation of neurons in the preoptic and several other thermoregulatory nuclei is induced in vivo by thermal signals originating in the periphery, and not in the CNS.",Excluded
817,"Transcervical carotid stenting with internal carotid artery flow reversal: Feasibility and preliminary results Transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS), with or without distal protection, is associated with risk for cerebral and peripheral embolism and access site complications. To establish cerebral protection before crossing the carotid lesion and to avert transfemoral access complications, the present study was undertaken to evaluate a transcervical approach for CAS with carotid flow reversal for cerebral protection. Fifty patients underwent CAS through a transcervical approach. All patients with symptoms had greater than 60% internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, and all patients without symptoms had greater than 80% ICA stenosis. Twenty-one patients (42%) had symptomatic disease or ipsilateral stroke, and 8 patients (16%) had contralateral stroke. Four patients (8%) had recurrent stenosis, 7 patients (14%) had contralateral ICA occlusion, and 1 patient (2%) had undergone previous neck radiation. Twenty-seven procedures (54%) were performed with local anesthesia, and 23 (46%) with general anesthesia. Using a cervical cutdown, flow was reversed in the ICA by occluding the common carotid artery and establishing a carotid-jugular vein fistula. Pre-dilation was selective, and 8-mm to 10-mm self-expanding stents were deployed and post-dilated with 5-mm to 6-mm balloons in all cases. The procedure was technically successful in all patients, without significant residual stenoses. No strokes or deaths occurred. There was 1 wound complication (2%). All patients were discharged within 2 days of surgery. Mean flow reversal time was 21.4 minutes (range, 9-50 minutes). Carotid flow reversal was not tolerated in 2 patients (4%). Early in the experience, carotid flow reversal was not possible in 1 patient, and there were 1 major and 3 minor common carotid artery dissections, which resolved after stent placement. One intraoperative transient ischemic attack (2%) occurred in 1 patient in whom carotid flow was not reversed, and 1 patient with a contralateral ICA occlusion had a contralateral transient ischemic attack. At 1 to 12 months of follow-up, all patients remained asymptomatic, and all but 1 stent remained patent. Transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal is feasible and safe. It can be done with the patient under local anesthesia, averts the complications of the transfemoral approach, and eliminates the increased complexity and cost of cerebral protection devices. Transcervical CAS is feasible when the transfemoral route is impossible or contraindicated, and may be the procedure of choice in a subset of patients in whom carotid stenting is indicated.",Excluded

493,"Molecular architecture of a complex between an adhesion protein from the malaria parasite and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 The adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to human tissues or endothelium is central to the pathology caused by the parasite during malaria. It contributes to the avoidance of parasite clearance by the spleen and to the specific pathologies of cerebral and placental malaria. The PfEMP1 family of adhesive proteins is responsible for this sequestration by mediating interactions with diverse human ligands. In addition, as the primary targets of acquired, protective immunity, the PfEMP1s are potential vaccine candidates. PfEMP1s contain large extracellular ectodomains made from CIDR (cysteine-rich interdomain regions) and DBL (Duffy-binding-like) domains and show extensive variation in sequence, size, and domain organization. Here we use biophysical methods to characterize the entire ~300-kDa ectodomain from IT4VAR13, a protein that interacts with the host receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). We show through small angle x-ray scattering that IT4VAR13 is rigid, elongated, and monomeric. We also show that it interacts with ICAM-1 through the DBLbeta domain alone, forming a 1:1 complex. These studies provide a first low resolution structural view of a PfEMP1 ectodomain in complex with its ligand. They show that it combines a modular domain arrangement consisting of individual ligand binding domains, with a defined higher order architecture that exposes the ICAM-1 binding surface to allow adhesion.",Excluded
552,"Fractionated stereotactic-guided radiotherapy in the treatment of pituitary adenomas. [Spanish] AIMS: To evaluate the survival rates, prognostic factors and adverse events in patients with pituitary adenomas following fractionated stereotactic-guided radiotherapy (FSRT). MATERIAL AND METHODS. Fifty-six patients with pituitary adenomas were treated with FSRT; 23 patients (41.1%) had primary adenomas, 33 had recurrent disease; 24 (42.9%) with non-functional and 32 (57.1%) with functional adenomas. Using conventional fractionation, median total dose administered was 54 Gy (range: 24-56 Gy). RESULTS. The median follow-up was 51 months (range: 9-102) and, at the time of analysis, 49 patients were alive and disease-free, 1 patient was alive with reduced visual acuity and biochemical indications of recurrence, 2 patients had died from the disease and 1 patient had died from unrelated causes. Overall survival was 94% (50/53) and overall local tumour control was 92% (49/53). Univariate analysis indicated hormonal secretion (ACTH) and previous radiotherapy as being statistically significant. Fourteen patients (25%) had minor side-effects during treatment and 3 patients (5.4%) had late-onset events; 2 with optical neuropathy (both patients had other relevant co-existing diseases) and 1 patient had brain necrosis (re-irradiation). CONCLUSION. Fractionated stereotactic-guided radiotherapy is an effective modality for the treatment of pituitary adenomas. Care is required in patients with co-morbidities and/or previously-irradiated recurrent tumour so as to minimise late-onset secondary effects.",Excluded

The radiation was administered dorsally in single fractions, and in 15-day-old animals, to different lengths of the rostral cord and in doses ranging from 16 to 38 Gy. The duration of the latent period was found to be directly proportional to the age of the animal at the time of irradiation, and independent of radiation dose or the volume of the cervical cord which was irradiated. In the majority of paretic animals, the irradiated segment of the spinal cord demonstrated white matter necrosis. The results indicate that in the developing rat, the manifestations of radiation myelopathy are delayed by an interval determined in part by the age of the animal at the time of irradiation.",Included
982,"BDNF Met allele as a risk factor for inflammation-induced depression in breast cancer survivors Inflammation may contribute to the development of depression in a subset of individuals. However, risk factors that render certain individuals more vulnerable to depression following an inflammatory stimulus have not been determined. Drawing from animal stud-ies showing that reductions in neural plasticity may mediate effects of inflammation on depressive symptoms, we hypothesized that individuals genetically predisposed to lower levels of neural plasticity may be more susceptible to inflammation-induced depression. More specifically, the current study examined whether the Met allele of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, which predisposes individuals to reduced levels of plasticity, moderates the association between inflammation and depressive symptoms. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 111 women with early-stage breast cancer who had recently completed treatment with surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, which can activate inflammatory pathways. Participants provided blood draws for genotyping and assessment of circulating inflammatory markers, and completed a questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms, including somatic, affective, and cognitive components of depression. Results revealed a significant interaction between BDNF genotype and CRP in predicting depressive symptoms (p =.036), such that women carrying at least one Met allele displayed a stronger association between CRP and cognitive depressive symptoms than those without a Met allele. A similar interaction emerged for IL-1ra (p =.055). Results support the hypothesis that the BDNF Met allele may be a risk factor for inflam-mation-induced depression among breast cancer survivors.",Excluded

480,"The impact of colonic resection for neoplasia on functional outcomes and related quality of life: A case-controlled study Introduction Aim Functional outcomes after elective colectomy (right, left or sigmoid) for neoplasia are poorly reported in the literature. This study evaluates bowel function and related quality of life in patients 2 - 4 years after hemicolectomy, comparing the results to healthy controls. Methods Eligible patients were identified from prospectively maintained colorectal databases at two teaching hospitals. Patients were recruited during regular follow up visits or by telephone interview. Patient relatives with an intact colon were recruited as controls. Study exclusion criteria were poor cognitive ability, inflammatory bowel disease, metastatic disease, previous pelvic radiation, prior colonic, stomach or small bowel resection, bypass surgery, vagotomy, an existing stoma and anal incontinence. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) questionnaire was used to assess bowel function and the EQ-5D questionnaire to assess quality of life (QOL). Parametric and non-parametric tests were used with log transformation and regression methods for skewed data. Association between EQ-5D and MSKCC scores was examined with Spearman's rank correlation. Results A total of 85 patients (mean age 69 +/- 11.2 years) and 85 controls (mean age 58.2 +/- 13.4 years) were recruited in 12 months. Patients reported a significantly higher number of bowel movements per day than controls (2 versus 1, P < 0.001). Initial analysis suggested that patients had a significantly lower total MSKCC score (group difference mean -3.1, CI -5.8 to -0.4, p = 0.02), indicating worse bowel function in the patient group. Following adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, differences in total score were no longer significant, but the patient group had a lower score for the frequency subscale and the ability to control flatus (p = 0.008 and p = < 0.001). MSKCC frequency scores were worse after right-sided resections (p = 0.03). High scores for complete emptying and the differentiation between wind and solid had a positive correlation with better QOL (p = 0.007 and 0.02 respectively). There was a nonsignificant decrease in the overall QOL (EQ-5D p = 0.6, EQ-VAS p = 0.12) following hemicolectomy compared with controls. Conclusion Colonic resection has an adverse effect on bowel frequency with worse outcomes following right hemicolectomy. Good colonic function, as assessed by the MSKCC questionnaire, is associated with better QOL.",Excluded

834,"Long-term depression is not modulated by ATP receptors in the rat CA1 hippocampal region ATP is an important extracellular messenger in the CNS. In the hippocampus, a brain structure relevant for learning and memory processes, it acts both as a modulator and as a mediator of synaptic transmission, with implications for synaptic plasticity phenomena. Recent evidence suggests that ATP modulates activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. However, it remains unclear if ATP also modulates LTP counterpart's phenomenon, long-term depression (LTD), in the rat hippocampus. This study investigated the effect of ATP analogues on homosynaptic LTD, induced by low-frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals (1 Hz; 900 pulses) in the CA1 region of young rat hippocampal slices. The metabolically stable ATP analogues beta,gamma-ImATP (20 microM), a P2 receptor agonist, and alpha,beta-MeATP (20 microM), a preferential P2X(1,3) receptor agonist, did not modify LTD (LTD values of 14.7+/-0.5% and 14.1+/-3% for aCSF controls and of 15.1+/-4% and 19.0+/-5.2% for beta,gamma-ImATP and alpha,beta-MeATP, respectively).

386,"Temozolomide for central nervous system involvement in mycosis fungoides BACKGROUND: The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most commonly involved sites in the systemic progression of primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) such as mycosis fungoides (MF). There is no consensus on the treatment of CNS progression in CTCL, but survival of 3-6 months is suggested when methotrexate-based chemotherapy and/or CNS irradiation is used. Temozolomide is active in earlier stages of MF and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. There are no published data on its use in MF patients with CNS involvement.METHODS: Four MF patients were treated with oral temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 d on a 28-day cycle) for CNS progression. Two patients received temozolomide with low-dose CNS irradiation as initial treatment, and two received temozolomide following disease progression after methotrexate-based chemotherapy and CNS irradiation. All patients received dexamethasone.RESULTS: Temozolomide was well tolerated; there were no treatment withdrawals or dose reductions caused by toxicity. Patient 1 had an excellent partial response in pre-irradiated disease. Patient 2 showed disease stabilization following irradiation. Patient 3 showed a complete response after a partial response to irradiation. Patient 4 demonstrated continued stabilization after a partial response to irradiation. Overall survival ranged from 10 to 33 months. Patient 3 remains alive and symptom-free at 23 months following treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Temozolomide following low-dose CNS irradiation appears to be well tolerated and effective in MF patients with CNS progression. It may represent a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy containing methotrexate or an option for second-line therapy.",Excluded
669,"Carbenoxolone impairs LTP and blocks NMDA receptors in murine hippocampus Effects of the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX) on tetanus- and taurine-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) were studied on Schaffer collateral-CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in mouse hippocampal slices. Preincubation with 10 microM CBX reduced the amount of LTP induced by weak theta-burst stimulation (TBS) or a single train of stimuli (HFS; 1s at 100 Hz), but did not affect LTP induced by 30-min perfusion with 10 mM taurine. Incubation with 50-100 microM CBX 15 min before HFS or TBS abolished tetanus-induced LTP. At 100 microM CBX, the concentration that is used for the blockade of gap junctions in vitro, a long-lasting depression of fEPSPs was observed which persisted under the blockade of NMDA receptors, and receptors for corticosteroids. A similar depression was produced by the CBX inactive analogue glycyrrhizic acid and the broad spectrum calcium channel antagonist ruthenium red. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from acutely isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that CBX exerts a selective dose-dependent inhibition of NMDA-evoked currents with an IC(50)=104 microM. Thus the widely used gap junction uncoupler CBX acts as an antagonist at NMDA receptors and consequently impairs the induction of LTP.",Excluded

Since TMZ is used in clinics in combination with radiotherapy, we also studied the effects of TMZ in combination with ionising radiation (IR).METHODS: Cell colony-forming ability was measured using a clonogenic assay. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis were evaluated by Flow Cytometry (FCM). Proteins involved in cell cycle control were detected by Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assays.RESULTS: Our data showed that TMZ, independent of MGMT expression, inhibited glioblastoma cell growth via an irreversible G(2) block in MGMT depleted cells or the induction of apoptosis in MGMT normal expressing cells. When TMZ was administered in combination with IR, apoptosis was greater than observed with either agent separately. This TMZ-induced apoptosis in the MGMT expressing cells occurred through Akt/Glycogen-Synthase-Kinase-3s (GSK3s) signalling and was mediated by Myelocytomatosis (c-Myc) oncoprotein. Indeed, TMZ phosphorylated/activated Akt led to phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK3s which resulted in the stabilisation of c-Myc protein and subsequent modulation of the c-Myc target genes involved in the apoptotic processes.CONCLUSION: C-Myc expression could be considered a good indicator of TMZ effectiveness.",Excluded
894,"Cell type-specific hypersensitivity to oxidative damage in CSB and XPA mice Mutations in the CSB gene cause Cockayne syndrome (CS), a rare inherited disorder, characterized by UV-sensitivity, severe neurodevelopmental and progeroid symptoms. CSB functions in the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), responsible for the removal of UV-induced and other helix-distorting lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. Several lines of evidence support the notion that the CSB TCR defect extends to other non-NER type transcription-blocking lesions, notably various kinds of oxidative damage, which may provide an explanation for part of the severe CS phenotype. We used genetically defined mouse models to examine the relationship between the CSB defect and sensitivity to oxidative damage in different cell types and at the level of the intact organism. The main conclusions are: (1) CSB(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit a clear hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, extending the findings in genetically heterogeneous human CSB fibroblasts to another species. (2) CSB(-/-) MEFs are highly sensitive to paraquat, strongly indicating that the increased cytotoxicity is due to oxidative damage. (3) The hypersenstivity is independent of genetic background and directly related to the CSB defect and is not observed in totally NER-deficient XPA MEFs. (4) Wild type embryonic stem (ES) cells display an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation compared to fibroblasts. Surprisingly, the CSB deficiency has only a very minor additional effect on ES cell sensitivity to oxidative damage and is comparable to that of an XPA defect, indicating cell type-specific differences in the contribution of TCR and NER to cellular survival. (5) Similar to ES cells, CSB and XPA mice both display a minor sensitivity to whole-body X-ray exposure. This suggests that the response of an intact organism to radiation is largely determined by the sensitivity of stem cells, rather than differentiated cells. These findings establish the role of transcription-coupled repair in resistance to oxidative damage and reveal a cell- and organ-specific impact of this repair pathway to the clinical phenotype of CS and XP.",Excluded

501,"Functional imaging of the brain in the evaluation of drug response and its application to the study of aging Functional neuroimaging techniques including single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) can provide insight into the functional connectivity of the human brain in both health and disease, including the effects of aging and drugs on brain function. Neuroimaging measurement techniques can either be direct, using radiospecific ligands, or indirect, using the neurophysiological consequences of pharmacological interventions. Both approaches can be combined with sensorimotor or cognitive activation to examine the interaction between the targeted receptor function and the sensorimotor or cognitive process implicit in the study design. Using radionuclides, PET can provide absolute measurement of cerebral blood flow to regions of interest and can measure changes in cerebral metabolism using labelled fluorodeoxyglucose. PET offered the first opportunity to image brain activation caused by a variety of stimuli and hence to measure the effect of drugs on brain activation. PET also enables the study of drug disposition within the brain. SPECT has been used to study relative changes in cerebral blood flow associated with disease processes and also receptor occupancy. FMRI, by contrast, does not involve ionising radiation and has better spatial and temporal resolution. It is still a relatively new technique and limited by its ability to only measure haemodynamic changes through the blood oxygen lever dependent (BOLD) signal. The effects of aging on drug responsiveness and the effects of drug treatment of diseases associated with old age are relatively unexplored areas of functional neuroimaging research.",Excluded

Controls answered the questionnaire and underwent straylight measurement and (in a random one-sixth sample) cataract grading.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Retinal straylight levels and subjective visual symptoms.RESULTS: Among 230 LPI-treated subjects (121 [58.8%] with LPI totally covered by the lid, 43 [19.8%] with LPI partly covered by the lid, 53 [24.4%] with LPI uncovered by the lid), 217 (94.3%) completed all testing, as did 250 (93.3%) of 268 controls. Age, gender, and prevalence of visual symptoms did not differ between treated subjects and controls, although nuclear (P<0.01) and cortical (P = 0.03) cataract were less common among controls. Neither presenting visual acuity nor straylight score differed between the treated and untreated eyes among all treated persons, nor among those (n = 96) with LPI partially or totally uncovered. Prevalence of subjective glare did not differ significantly between participants with totally covered LPI (6.61%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.39%-12.5%), partially covered LPI (11.6%; 95% CI, 5.07%-24.5%), or totally uncovered LPI (9.43%; 95% CI, 4.10%-10.3%). In regression models, only worse cortical cataract grade (P = 0.01) was associated significantly with straylight score, and no predictors were associated with subjective glare. None of the LPI size or location parameters were associated with straylight or subjective symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggests that LPI is safe regarding measures of straylight and visual symptoms. This randomized design provides strong evidence that treatment programs for narrow angles would be unlikely to result in important medium-term visual disability.",Excluded

475,"Signaling and apoptosis in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. [Japanese] Tumor necrosis a (TNF) is a key mediator of many acute injuries to the liver, including alcoholic liver injury, viral hepatitis and ischemia reperfusion injury. Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is an important clinical problem for several organs including brain, heart, kidney, and liver. Hepatic I/R injuries occur during transplantation, liver resection for tumor, and circulatory shock. Possible consequences of hepatic I/R injury include liver failure and/or multi-organ system failures, resulting in morbidity and mortality. Hepatic I/R injury produces two types of cell death, apoptosis and necrosis in hepatocytes and non parenchymal cells. Several intracellular signaling molecules are activated by I/R including NFkB and c-Jun N terminal kinase, (JNK). JNK is phosphorylated and activated by several types of stresses, including stimulation by cytokines, such as TNFalpha and IL-1, and environmental stresses such as radiation and oxidant stress. Substrates for JNK include the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF-2. Recent studies have proposed that activated JNK may also directly affect mitochondria through undefined substrates leading to apoptosis. JNK is strongly induced during warm hepatic I/R injury and during the cold ischemial warm repetition injury of liver transplantation.

889,"Characteristics of spontaneous and induced specific-locus mutation in the ad-3 region of Neurospora crassa: utilization in genetic risk assessment Data from experiments on the induction of specific-locus mutations in model systems are utilized in genetic risk assessment to estimate potential adverse effects in the human population. In such assessments with radiation or chemical mutagens, the following information is required: (1) spontaneous and induced forward-mutation frequencies, (2) dose-response curves for the overall induction of specific-locus mutations, (3) genetic characterization of spontaneous and induced mutations, and (4) dose-response curves for the different genotypic classes. Specific-locus assays in most eukaryote assay systems provide only portions of the information required for genetic risk assessment. In recognition of the need for a more comprehensive data base, a model system was developed for specific-locus studies in Neurospora crassa. The adenine-3 (ad-3) specific-locus assay was modeled after the 2 gene, morphological specific-locus assay in the dilute-short-ear region of the mouse, and it detects forward-mutations at two closely linked loci: ad-3A and ad-3B. The ad-3 assay system has provided precise dose-response curves not only for inactivation, but also the overall induction of ad-3 mutations. The utilization of this assay in experiments with radiation or chemical mutagens has provided a data base on the induction and genetic characterization of specific-locus mutations that is unique among eukaryotic organisms. In this assay, gene/point mutations, multilocus deletion mutations, and 3 different classes of multiple-locus mutations can be identified. The latter consist of specific-locus mutations associated with recessive lethal mutations located either closely linked to the ad-3 region or elsewhere in the genome. The overall data base on the heterozygous effects of X-ray-induced ad-3 mutations demonstrates that such effects are allele specific, genotype specific, and locus specific. There are probably a variety of mechanisms by which the heterozygous effects of individual allelic mutations at different genetic loci can be affected. In conclusion, unless the frequencies of all of the different classes of induced specific-locus mutations are determined, and utilized in genetic risk assessment exercises, the risk of human exposure to environmental mutagens may be grossly underestimated.

830,"Orthostatic myoclonus after brain tumor radiation: Insights from two lesional cases INTRODUCTION: Orthostatic myoclonus (OM) is a recognized syndrome of gait unsteadiness accompanied by lower limb myoclonus provoked by the assumption of an upright posture. OM typically affects the elderly and is often associated with neurodegenerative disease. We sought to review the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of OM due to brain tumor treatment, the first reported lesional cases of this rare disorder.METHODS: The database of the Mayo Clinic Rochester Movement Disorders Laboratory was searched for all patients diagnosed with OM from January 2007 to December 2016. All available clinical, radiographic, and surface electromyographic data were reviewed, and patients with a history of primary or metastatic brain tumor were analyzed.RESULTS: Two patients with OM and brain tumor were identified; both had undergone tumor resection and targeted brain radiation. Both patients complained of unsteadiness while walking and recurrent falls. Tumor pathology (atypical meningioma, gliosarcoma) was centered in the frontal lobe and extended to the supplementary motor area (SMA), pre-SMA, or prefrontal cortex. Medications did not improve gait.CONCLUSION: Two cases of brain tumor-related OM suggest that degeneration of frontal motor programming circuits underlies the pathophysiology of OM.",Excluded
740,"The Radio-protective effects of Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester and Thymoquinone in rats exposed to total head irradiation Background: Many cancer patients treated with radiotherapy suffer severe side effects during and after their treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of irradiation and the addition of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and thymoquinone (TQ) on the oxidant/antioxidant system in the liver tissue of irradiated rats. Methods: A total of 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of thymoquinone and caffeic acid phenethyl ester administered by intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Results: While liver tissue total oxidant status, lipid hydroperoxide level, and oxidative stress index were significantly increased in the irradiated (IR) group, compared with other groups, total antioxidant status, sulfhydryl levels, and paraoxonase (PON) activity were significantly decreased. Ceruloplasmin activity in IR plus TQ and IR groups was higher than the control group. Arylesterase and PON activities in IR plus TQ- and IR plus CAPE-supplemented groups were lower than those of control groups. Conclusions: TQ and CAPE decrease oxidative stress markers and have antioxidant effects, which also augment antioxidant capacity in the liver tissue of irradiated rats.

47,"Low-grade gliomas: The cleveland clinic experience BACKGROUND: Low-grade gliomas account for 10-20% of all primary brain. tumors. There is limited data on specific prognostic factors for patients. with low-grade gliomas. METHOD(S): After obtaining IRB approval, the Cleveland Clinic Brain Tumor and Neuro-Oncology Center's database was used to identify patients with histologically confirmed grade 2 glioma at the time of diagnosis. Multivariable analysis was conducted with use of a Cox proportional hazards model and a stepwise selection algorithm that used p < 0.10 as the criteria for entry and p < 0.05 as retention in the model to identify independent predictors of survival. RESULT(S): Chart records of 478patients (54% of whom were men) diagnosed between 1991 and 2010 were included for analysis. The median age at presentation was 41 years (range, 18-83 years).42% of patients had biopsy only, 27% had gross total resection, 6% had near. total resection, and 25% had subtotal resection. 22% of patients were initially treated with radiation, 30% with adjuvant chemotherapy, and 7% with concurrent chemotherapy. Median progression free survival and median overall survival (OS) were 5.1 years and 12.8 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, independent of additional therapy, five factors were identified as independent predictors of OS: age at diagnosis (p = 0.002), Karnofsky performance status (KPS, p < 0.0001), histology (astrocytoma vs. other, p = 0.001), hemispheric location (left or bilateral involvement vs. right, p = 0.02) and gender (male vs. female, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION(S): Older age, male gender, poor performance status, astrocytic histology, and left hemispheric or bilateral involvement are associated with higher mortality.",Excluded
619,"Neuroimaging in Pregnant Women Choosing the most appropriate diagnostic neuroimaging study for a pregnant woman involves assessing the pretest likelihood of serious treatable neurologic disease, the diagnostic utility of various available computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) modalities, and the risks of each. Of these three elements-pretest differential diagnosis, utility of MRI and CT, and risks of MR and CT-the risk component is perhaps the least well understood by most physicians. We provide a basic review of the intrinsic risks of MRI and CT, particularly radiation biology and radiation safety, as well as the risks pertaining to the use of contrast agents, to reduce provider confusion and anxiety and improve quality, safety, and efficiency of neuroimaging diagnosis in pregnant patients. We believe that a better understanding of the associated very low risks with mother and fetus will reassure the reader that CT remains the most appropriate tool for initial rapid diagnosis of acute neurological conditions in pregnancy and that in urgent situations CT should not be withheld or delayed due to exaggerated concern about radiation. Noncontrast MRI, while not without risk, is generally considered safe in pregnancy, as no evidence of fetal adverse effects has been demonstrated to date. Iodinated CT contrast agents are likely safer than gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents because of gadolinium accumulation in the amniotic fluid and fetal tissue, although no harmful effects of tissue gadolinium accumulation are known. In most but not all pregnant patients presenting with a new or worsening neurological abnormality, the risks intrinsic to the disease will outweigh the risks of imaging. In an individual patient, the pretest probability of serious treatable disease and acuity of presentation will usually suggest an optimal imaging strategy and choice of test. This optimal strategy will also depend on the immediate availability and level of sophistication of the scanners, software, technologists, and radiologists. As such, the standard of care for imaging in pregnancy requires direct consultation between the referring clinician and radiologist to determine the most appropriate strategy and brief documentation of the resulting consensus risk-benefit assessment.

500,"C-Jun N-terminal kinase regulates adenosine A1 receptor-mediated synaptic depression in the rat hippocampus Adenosine A1 receptors are ubiquitous mediators of presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmission in the central nervous system, yet the signalling pathway linking A1 receptor activation and decreased neurotransmitter release remains poorly resolved. We tested the contribution of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to adenosine A1 receptor-mediated depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus. We found that inhibition of JNK with SP600125 or JNK inhibitor V, but not an inactive analogue, attenuated the depression of fEPSPs induced by adenosine, hypoxia, and the A1 receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA). In contrast, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 did not inhibit GABA(B)-mediated synaptic depression. In support of our electrophysiological findings, Western blot analysis showed that A1 receptor stimulation resulted in a transient increase in JNK phosphorylation in the membrane fraction of hippocampal lysates. The total amount of JNK in the membrane fraction was unchanged by CPA treatment. The increase in phosphorylated JNK induced by A1 receptor stimulation was blocked by the A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), indicating that A1 receptors specifically activate JNK in the hippocampus. Together with functional data indicating that JNK inhibition decreased CPA-induced paired pulse facilitation, these results suggest that JNK activation is necessary for adenosine A1 receptor-mediated synaptic depression occurring at a presynaptic locus The adenosine A1 receptor-JNK signalling pathway may represent a novel mechanism underlying inhibition of neurotransmitter release in the CNS.",Excluded

761,"Lymphopoiesis in the chicken pineal gland Pineal lymphoid development was studied in two breeds of chickens from hatching until sexual maturity. No lymphocytes were found in the pineal prior to 9 days of age (da). Lymphocytes migrate through the endothelium of venules into the pineal stroma. Lymphoid tissue reached its maximal accumulation in 32-da pineal glands of both breeds. At this age, the New Hampshire (NH) breed had a larger proportion of lymphoid volume to total pineal volume (32%) than did pineal glands from White Leghorn (WL) chickens (18%). Averaged over the period 23 to 62 da, NH chickens (a heavy breed) had a lymphoid volume (0.753 mm 3) that was about three times greater (P less than 0.05) than that of the lighter WL breed (0.251 mm 3). Lymphocytes are able to enter cerebrospinal fluid form lymphoid accumulations (LA) embedded in the choroid plexus by migrating between choroid ependymal cells. The 122-da chickens typically lacked lymphoid tissue in the pineal gland with the exception of occasional LA contained in capsular tissue. Surgical bursectomy, thymectomy, or their combination at hatching followed with whole-body irradiation (IR) at 24 hours postsurgery inhibited the initial influx of lymphocytes usually seen in 9-da pineal glands. Also, these treatments prevented formation of germinal centers normally found in the pineal at 3 and 5 weeks and reduced total pineal volume at each age examined. However, pineal lymphoid volume of the surgical-IR group did not differ from control-IR chickens at either 3 or 5 weeks. Pineal glands from birds made agammaglobulinemic (bursa-cell depleted) by cyclophosphamide treatment in ovo were devoid of germinal centers, although thin strands of lymphocytes were usually found along venous sinuses. These dissociation studies suggest that the normal expression of lymphoid tissue in the chicken pineal gland is dependent on the bursa and thymus. Furthermore, these observations indicate that the pineal gland should be considered a functional component of the chicken's lymphomyeloid complex.",Excluded
698,"Cerebral computed tomography angiography using a low tube voltage (80 kVp) and a moderate concentration of iodine contrast material: a quantitative and qualitative comparison with conventional computed tomography angiography OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of an 80-kVp protocol using a moderate concentration contrast material (MC-CM) for cerebral computed tomography angiography by comparison with a conventional 120-kVp protocol using a high concentration contrast material (HC-CM).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Attenuation values and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were determined in a head phantom for 2 tube voltages (80 and 120 kVp) and 2 different iodine concentration contrast materials (HC-CM and MC-CM). Among 90 consecutive patients, 45 patients were scanned with 120 kVp and 150 mAs(eff) after administration of 70 mL of HC-CM (370 mg iodine [mgI]/mL), whereas the other 45 patients were scanned with 80 kVp and 370 mAs(eff) after administration of 70 mL of MC-CM (300 mgI/mL). The Hounsfield units (HU) of the internal carotid artery T junction, SNR, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), subjective degree of arterial enhancement, image noise, sharpness of the cerebral arterial boundary, and overall diagnostic image quality were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS: The mean attenuation of the internal carotid artery T junction, SNR, and CNR was significantly higher in the 80 kVp with MC-CM group (379.2, 33.7, and 31.1 HU, respectively) than in the 120 kVp with HC-CM group (282.2, 31.1, and 27.2 HU, respectively). The 80-kVp protocol resulted in significantly higher score in arterial enhancement, sharpness of the cerebral arteries, and overall diagnostic image quality. The effective dose of 80 kVp (0.7 mSv) was 22.2% lower than that of 120 kVp (0.9 mSv).CONCLUSIONS: The use of 80 kVp with MC-CM improved arterial enhancement, SNR, and CNR and provided superior quality images using a smaller amount of iodine and a lower radiation dose than the conventional protocol of 120 kVp with HC-CM.",Excluded

In this study, optogenetic stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 (FGFR1) was performed to study the effects of subcellular targeting of receptor kinases on signaling and neurite outgrowth. The catalytic domain of FGFR1 fused to the algal light-oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV) domain was directed to different cellular compartments (plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus) in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Blue light stimulation elevated the pERK and pPLCgamma1 levels in membrane-opto-FGFR1-transfected cells similarly to ligand-induced receptor activation; however, no changes in pAKT levels were observed. PC12 cells transfected with membrane-opto-FGFR1 exhibited significantly longer neurites after light stimulation than after growth factor treatment, and significantly more neurites extended from their cell bodies. The activation of cytoplasmic FGFR1 kinase enhanced ERK signaling in HEK293 cells but not in PC12 cells and did not induce neuronal differentiation. The stimulation of FGFR1 kinase in the nucleus also did not result in signaling changes or neurite outgrowth. We conclude that FGFR1 kinase needs to be associated with membranes to induce the differentiation of PC12 cells mainly via ERK activation.",Excluded

Median survival and progression-free survival calculated from the initiation of radiotherapy were 48 months (range, 2-133 months) and 38 months (range, 2-132 months), respectively. Progression-free survival rates after radiation were 89% at 1 year and 52% at 5 years. Of 26 recurrences, 92% developed in field. With regard to histology, overall survival rates in the World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II group were 89% and 74% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. In patients with WHO Grade III tumors, overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 69% and 46%, respectively. No prognosticators could be identified for median survival and progression-free survival after radiotherapy. Median overall survival calculated from primary diagnosis was 77.5 months (range, 3-214 months). The Cox regression multivariate analysis for age and neurologic symptoms showed a significance of p = 0.003 for age and p = 0.037 for the presence of neurologic symptoms on overall survival since primary diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Commonly, conventional conformal RT is applied in the treatment of brain tumors. In FSRT, the tumor volume can be irradiated with high doses, sparing volume of normal brain tissue. Our data are in accordance with survival times found in the literature. Ninety-two percent of all recurrences occurred within the defined target volume, confirming that reduction of the RT portals by the use of FSRT does not lead to an increased rate of recurrences at the field border or out of field. Fractionated stereotactic RT can therefore be implemented as an effective and safe modality in the therapy of primary oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma.",Excluded

We have previously published a new method to derive pCT images from head T1-weighted (T1-w) MR images using a single-atlas propagation scheme followed by a post hoc correction of the mapped CT numbers using local intensity information. The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of our method with head zero echo time (ZTE) MR images. To evaluate results, the mean absolute error in bins of 20 HU was calculated with respect to the true planning CT scan of the patient. We demonstrated that applying our method using ZTE MR images instead of T1-w improved the correctness of the pCT in case of bone resection surgery prior to RT (that is, an example of large anatomical difference between the atlas and the patient).",Excluded
788,"Brain irradiation leads to persistent neuroinflammation and long-term neurocognitive dysfunction in a region-specific manner Long-term cognitive deficits are observed after treatment of brain tumors or metastases by radiotherapy. Treatment optimization thus requires a better understanding of the effects of radiotherapy on specific brain regions, according to their sensitivity and interconnectivity. In the present study, behavioral tests supported by immunohistology and magnetic resonance imaging provided a consistent picture of the persistent neurocognitive decline and neuroinflammation after the onset of irradiation-induced necrosis in the right primary somatosensory cortex of Fischer rats. Necrosis surrounded by neovascularization was first detected 54 days after irradiation and then spread to 110 days in the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory region, striatum and right ventricle, resulting in fiber bundle disruption and demyelination in the corpus callosum of the right hemisphere. These structural damages translated into selective behavioral changes including spatial memory loss, disinhibition of anxiety-like behaviors, hyperactivity and pain hypersensitivity, but no significant alteration in motor coordination and grip strength abilities. Concomitantly, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, accompanied by infiltration of leukocytes (CD45+) and T-cells (CD3+) cooperated to shape the neuroinflammation response. Overall, our study suggests that the slow and gradual onset of cellular damage would allow adaptation in brain regions that are susceptible to neuronal plasticity; while other cerebral structures that do not have this capacity would be more affected. The planning of radiotherapy, adjusted to the sensitivity and adaptability of brain structures, could therefore preserve certain neurocognitive functions; while higher doses of radiation could be delivered to brain areas that can better adapt to this treatment. In addition, strategies to block early post-radiation events need to be explored to prevent the development of long-term cognitive dysfunction.",Included

Research shows that an antioxidant-enriched diet may offer some protection against the cellular effects of radiation and may provide significant neuroprotection from the effects of radiation-induced cognitive and behavioral skill deficits. Ninety-six C57BL/6 mice (48 pomegranate fed and 48 control) were irradiated with proton radiation (2 Gy), and two-month postradiation behaviors were assessed using a battery of behavioral tests to measure cognitive and motor functions. Proton irradiation was associated with depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test, but this effect was ameliorated by the pomegranate diet. Males, in general, displayed worse coordination and balance than females on the rotarod task, and the pomegranate diet ameliorated this effect. Overall, it appears that proton irradiation, which may be encountered in space, may induce a different pattern of behavioral deficits in males than females and that a pomegranate diet may confer protection against some of those effects.",Included

28,"From prion diseases to prion-like propagation mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative sporadic, inherited, or acquired disorders. In humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the most studied prion disease. In animals, the most frequent prion diseases are scrapie in sheep and goat, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and the emerging chronic wasting disease in wild and captive deer in North America. The hallmark of prion diseases is the deposition in the brain of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, an abnormal beta-sheet-rich form of the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) (Prusiner 1982). According to the prion hypothesis, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can trigger the autocatalytic conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> into PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, presumably in the presence of cofactors (lipids and small RNAs) that have been recently identified. In this review, we will come back to the original works that led to the discovery of prions and to the protein-only hypothesis proposed by Dr. Prusiner. We will then describe the recent reports on mammalian synthetic prions and recombinant prions that strongly support the protein-only hypothesis.

Data included change in visual acuity, tumor size, recurrence, eye retention, and metastasis.RESULTS: From 2005 to 2010, 24 consecutive patients were treated with custom-sized plaques with 8-mm-wide, variable-depth slots. Radiation doses ranged from 69.3 to 163.8 Gy (mean, 85.0 Gy) based on delivering a minimum tumor dose of 85 Gy. All treatments were continuously delivered over 5 to 7 days. Mean patient age at presentation was 57 years. Tumors were within 1.5 mm of the optic nerve (n = 3, 13%), juxtapapillary (n = 6, 25%), touching >=180 degrees (n = 7, 29%), or circumpapillary (n = 8, 33%). Ultrasound revealed dome-shaped tumors in 79% of patients, collar-button tumors in 17% of patients, irregular tumor in 1 patient (4%), and intraneural invasion in 2 patients. Mean initial largest basal dimension was 11.0 mm (standard deviation [SD] +/- 3.5 mm; median, 11.4 mm; range, 5.9-16.4 mm). Mean initial tumor thickness was 3.5 mm (SD +/- 1.7 mm; median, 3.0 mm; range, 1.4-6.9 mm). Initial visual acuities were a median 20/25 (range, 20/20 to hand motions) and decreased to a median 20/40 (range, 20/20 to no light perception).

The risk factors for the disorders are: being middle aged, being male and exposed to chemical compounds or radiation. Plasma cell dyscrasias are classified into Myeloma, MGUS, Macroglobulinemia and Heavy Chain Disease. We want to show the uselfuness and importance of Freelite Assay for Myeloma diagnosis. Methods and Results: S.G., a 65-year-old man, was hospitalized in San Giuseppe Moscati Hospital to undergo an operation to his inguinal hernia. He had only a feeble pain at the abdomen, increasing with deambulation. Laboratory tests, performed before the surgery, didn't report important alterations. Haematological parameters had little variations compared to average values and reported a slight pancytopenia (RBC=3,7x106/muL, Plt=129x103/muL, WBC =3,8x103/muL) and a slight macrocytic and hyperchromic anemia (Hct=38,6%, MCV=104fL, MCH=36,1 pg). Calcemia was normal (9,1 mg/dL), serum protein electrophoresis showed a little hypogammaglobulinemia and a little thickening-band before gamma globulins. We measured FLC in S.G serum using Freelite Assay and unexpectedly it reported high levels of kappa free-chains (177 mg/dL) and a kappa/lambda ratio of 17,4. This data were then confirmed by other methods. Serum immunosubtraction identified a signal breakdown of thickeningband from kappa anti-serum in pre-gamma position. Then, we measured k and W chains in urine by nephelometry and performed urine electrophoresis. Nephelometry identified a massive excretion of kappa chains (kappa/lambda urinary ratio = 140) , urinary electrophoresis identified a strong band of immunoglobulins in pre-gamma position and an intermediate excretion of albumin. For the diagnosis of Myeloma we waited for the results of NMR, X-ray and bone marrow biopsy. X-ray reported radiolucency areas only in the cranial theca and NMR reported diploic hyperintense nuclei in L1 on the right side and in L2 on the right peduncle. Conclusion(s): Bioptic test of bone marrow, taken from iliac crest, allowed the identification of a conspicuous plasmocytosis (30%) and confirmed Myeloma diagnosis, which was previously and correctly formulated through FLC laboratory data.",Excluded
427,"Other dementias Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of degenerative dementia in elderly people after Alzheimer's disease (AD), with approximately 10-15% of dementia cases at autopsy demonstrating the presence of Lewy body pathology [1]. In Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia is a common outcome in up to 80% of patients with PD who will eventually develop dementia as their disease progresses [2, 3]. DLB and PD can be grouped under the umbrella term of Lewy body disease (LBD) due to the overlap in symptom profile, similar response to treatment and the common underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation neuropathology [4]. Together DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) represent an important disease group in older age, with significant health and social impacts. LBD patients display marked deficits in executive and visuo-spatial/visuo-perceptual function, as well as marked variations in their level of arousal and attention which are known as cognitive fluctuations [5-8]. LBD clinical features also include spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism [6], and nonmotor manifestations including symptoms such as visual hallucinations, autonomic dysfunction, syncope, repeated falls, REM sleep behaviour disorder, delusions and depression [6]. However, there are a number of important diagnostic challenges. For example, the differentiation of DLB from Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be difficult, particularly in the early stages of disease when core DLB symptoms may be less evident [9]. Similarly, discrimination between PD, PD or DLB with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, MCI-DLB) and PDD can be problematic as the development of cognitive impairment is often insidious and appears at a variable time after PD diagnosis [10]. There are also a number of treatment challenges. Profound cholinergic deficits occur in the LBDs, even more than in AD [11]. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors may have cognitive and neuropsychiatric benefits including improvements in global cognitive function, attentional function and activities of daily living [12]. However, there are frequently variations in treatment response [13]. The development of novel therapeutics is required, but this process has been hampered by the lack of LBD biomarkers which are sensitive to treatment response. In summary, therefore, there is a clear need to develop LBD biomarkers in order to facilitate early and differential diagnosis (during the prodromal phase of disease); improve our understanding of disease progression; provide a means to monitor therapeutic response; pave the way for early disease-modifying interventions. Existing biomarkers include a range of clinical, biochemical, genetic, proteomic, and, in particular, neuroimaging biomarkers [17, 18]. Generally the utility of these biomarkers has only been supported in a research context aside from dopamine transporter imaging, which due to its high specificity in differentiating LBD from AD [19] is now considered the gold standard for in vivo differential diagnosis between LBD and AD. However FP-CIT remains expensive, has a radioactive exposure and provides little or no information on the disease progression, prognosis, or correlation with cognitive/behavioural symptom severity. Biomarkers should ideally be inexpensive, non-invasive, simple to use and technically validated [20]. In this regard, neurophysiological measures, and in particular electroencephalography (EEG), are currently undergoing a renaissance as potential biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease.",Excluded
754,"Neuroinflammatory changes of the normal brain tissue in cured mice following combined radiation and anti-PD-1 blockade therapy for glioma The efficacy of combining radiation therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor blockade to treat brain tumors is currently the subject of multiple investigations and holds significant therapeutic promise. However, the long-term effects of this combination therapy on the normal brain tissue are unknown. Here, we examined mice that were intracranially implanted with murine glioma cell line and became long-term survivors after treatment with a combination of 10 Gy cranial irradiation (RT) and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade (aPD-1). Post-mortem analysis of the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to tumor implantation showed complete abolishment of hippocampal neurogenesis, but neural stem cells were well preserved in subventricular zone. In addition, we observed a drastic reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the subcortical white matter. Importantly, this observation was evident specifically in the combined (RT+aPD-1) treatment group but not in the single treatment arm of either RT alone or aPD-1 alone. Elimination of microglia with a small molecule inhibitor of colony stimulated factor-1 receptor (PLX5622) prevented the loss of mature oligodendrocytes. These results identify for the first time a unique pattern of normal tissue changes in the brain secondary to combination treatment with radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The results also suggest a role for microglia as key mediators of the adverse treatment effect.",Excluded
1124,"Electromagnetic interference in intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials and a wireless solution Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is utilized to minimize neurological morbidity during spine surgery. Transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs) are principal IONM signals in which the motor cortex of the subject is stimulated with electrical pulses and the evoked potentials are recorded from the muscles of interest. Currently available monitoring systems require the connection of 40-60 lengthy lead wires to the patient. These wires contribute to a crowded and cluttered surgical environment, and limit the maneuverability of the surgical team. In this work, it was demonstrated that the cumbersome wired system is vulnerable to electromagnetic interference (EMI) produced by operating room (OR) equipment. It was hypothesized that eliminating the lengthy recording wires can remove the EMI induced in the IONM signals. Hence, a wireless system to acquire TcMEPs was developed and validated through bench-top and animal experiments. Side-by-side TcMEPs acquisition from the wired and wireless systems in animal experiments under controlled conditions (absence of EMI from OR equipment) showed comparable magnitudes and waveforms, thus demonstrating the fidelity in the signal acquisition of the wireless solution. The robustness of the wireless system to minimize EMI was compared with a wired-system under identical conditions. Unlike the wired-system, the wireless system was not influenced by the electromagnetic waves from the C-Arm X-ray machine and temperature management system in the OR.

563,"Transcranial Photobiomodulation Therapy in the Cognitive Rehabilitation of Patients with Cranioencephalic Trauma <b>Objective:</b> This research evaluated the hemodynamic conditions before and after the transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) and investigated neurocognitive changes before and after treatment. <b>Background:</b> Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals 21-60 years old and causes ~500,000 people to be hospitalized in Brazil annually. Some survivors develop an irreversible decrease in neurological function, and the mortality rate is as high as 70% in severe cases. PBMT is an alternative to treat secondary injuries due to TBI. <b>Methods:</b> This multidisciplinary clinical study was carried out on 10 chronic adult patients with severe TBI, who were treated with PBMT with an optical device containing 13 sets of 4 light emitting diodes, and underwent hemodynamic transcranial Doppler and neuropsychological evaluation at three different times: pre-PBMT, post-PBMT (after a week), and late-PBMT, which occurred 3 months after the last session. The patients received PBMTs three times a week, for 6 weeks. PBMTs were performed for 18 sessions for 6 weeks and 30 min per session. <b>Results:</b> The results found an alteration in the cerebral blood flow (CBF) as well as a consequent increase of the cerebral oxygenation that helped to improve the cerebral function. <b>Conclusions:</b> The PBMT contributed to increased CBF, evidenced mainly by the increased left peak systolic velocity, which consequently increased the hemodynamic response after the PBMT and impacts on the peripheral cerebral perfusion contributing to improved cerebral function.",Excluded
704,"Cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment of atypical (Who Grade II) cranial meningiomas. [] BACKGROUND: The optimal management of subtotally resected atypical meningiomas is unknown. OBJECTIVE(S): To perform a retrospective review of patients with residual or recurrent atypical meningiomas treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHOD(S): Twenty-five patients were treated, either immediately after surgery (n = 15) or at the time of radiographic progression or treatment failure (n = 10). SRS was delivered to with a median marginal dose of 22 Gy (range, 16-30) in 1 to 4 fractions (median, 1), targeting a median tumor volume of 5.3 cm (range, 0.3-26.0). RESULT(S): With a median follow-up time of 28 months (range, 3-67), the 12-, 24-, and 36-month actuarial local and regional control rates for all patients were 94%, 94%, 74%, and 90%, 90%, 62%, respectively. There were 2 cases of radiation toxicity. On univariate analysis, the number of recurrences before SRS (P = .046), late SRS (ie, waiting until tumor progression to initiate treatment) (P = .03), and age at treatment >=60 years (P = .01) were significant predictors of recurrence. Of the 20 radiation-naive patients, 2 patients failed with the targeted lesion and 3 elsewhere in the resection bed, resulting in 12-, 24- and 36-month actuarial local and regional control rates of 100%, 100%, 73% and 93%, 93%, 75%, respectively. The overall locoregional control rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 93%, 93%, and 54%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Irradiation of the entire postoperative tumor bed may not be necessary for the majority of patients with subtotally resected atypical meningiomas. Patients in this series achieved outcomes comparable to that of historical control rates for larger volume, conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.",Excluded

Aiming to study how glioma cells respond to gamma-rays in terms of biological processes involved in cellular responses, we performed experiments at cellular context and gene expression analysis in U343-MG-a GBM cells irradiated with 1 Gy and collected at 6 h post-irradiation. The survival rate was approximately 61% for 1 Gy and was completely reduced at 16 Gy. By performing the microarray technique, 859 cDNA clones were analyzed. The Significance Analysis of Microarray algorithm indicated 196 significant expressed genes (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.42%): 67 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated genes, which belong to several classes: metabolism, adhesion/cytoskeleton, signal transduction, cell cycle/apoptosis, membrane transport, DNA repair/DNA damage signaling, transcription factor, intracellular signaling, and RNA processing. Differential expression patterns of five selected genes (HSPA9B, INPP5A, PIP5K1A, FANCG, and TPP2) observed by the microarray analysis were further confirmed by the quantitative real time RT-PCR method, which demonstrated an up-regulation status of those genes. These results indicate a broad spectrum of biological processes (which may reflect the radio-resistance of U343 cells) that were altered in irradiated glioma cells, so as to guarantee cell survival. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Excluded

The most frequent findings across all follow-up examinations were macular microaneurysms (75.6% of examinations), macular angiographic leakage (75.1%), and optic disc hyperfluorescence (62.8%). The median number of features present increased significantly with each follow-up to a maximum of 7 features at 8 years. The prevalence of neovascularization of the disc at 5 years was 5.2%. The prevalence of optic neuropathy at 5 years was 27.4%. Prognostic factors for more prevalent and severe posterior pole abnormalities were diabetes, tumor location close to both optic nerve and foveal avascular zone, and greater dose of radiation to the foveola and optic nerve head.CONCLUSIONS: The amount and severity of retinopathy and optic neuropathy after iodine-125 brachytherapy increased through 8 years of follow-up. Assessment of photographs and angiograms taken in accord with a standard protocol provided reliable estimates of rates of development of features of retinopathy and optic neuropathy in eyes treated using the COMS brachytherapy protocol.

546,"Effects of low intensity static magnetic field on FTIR spectra and ROS production in SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells Biological effects of man-made electromagnetic fields (EMFs) have been studied so far by experimental approaches exposing animals and cell cultures to EMFs. However, the evidence for cell toxicity induced by static magnetic field (SMF) is still uncertain. We investigated the effects produced by the exposure of human SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells to a uniform magnetic field at intensities of 2.2 mT, which is less than the recommended public exposure limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). A decrease of membrane mitochondrial potential up to 30% was measured after 24 h of exposure to SMF in SH-SY5Y cells, and this effect was associated with reactive oxygen species production increase. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that exposure to a static magnetic intensity around 2.2 mT changed the secondary structure of cellular proteins and lipid components. The vibration bands relative to the methylene group increased significantly after 4 h of exposure, whereas further exposure up to 24 h produced evident shifts of amide I and II modes and a relative increase in beta-sheet contents with respect to alpha-helix components. Our study demonstrated that a moderate SMF causes alteration in cell homeostasis, as indicated by FTIR spectroscopy observations of changes in protein structures that are part of cell response to magnetic field exposure.",Excluded
1121,"Selective, state-dependent activation of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in mouse neocortex The specific functions of subtypes of cortical inhibitory neurons are not well understood. This is due in part to a dearth of information about the behaviors of interneurons under conditions when the surrounding circuit is in an active state. We investigated the firing behavior of a subset of inhibitory interneurons, identified using mice that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a subset of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory cells (""GFP-expressing inhibitory neuron"" [GIN] cells). The somata of the GIN cells were in layer 2/3 of somatosensory cortex and had dense, layer 1-projecting axons that are characteristic of Martinotti neurons. Interestingly, GIN cells fired similarly during a variety of diverse activating conditions: when bathed in fluids with low-divalent cation concentrations, when stimulated with brief trains of local synaptic inputs, when exposed to group I metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists, or when exposed to muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonists. During these manipulations, GIN cells fired rhythmically and persistently in the theta-frequency range (3-10 Hz). Synchronous firing was often observed and its strength was directly proportional to the magnitude of electrical coupling between GIN cells. These effects were cell type specific: the four manipulations that persistently activated GIN cells rarely caused spiking of regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal cells or fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. Our results suggest that supragranular GIN interneurons form an electrically coupled network that exerts a coherent 3- to 10-Hz inhibitory influence on its targets. Because GIN cells are more readily activated than RS and FS cells, it is possible that they act as ""first responders"" when cortical excitatory activity increases.",Excluded

771,"Radiation dose analysis of large and giant internal carotid artery aneurysm treatment with the pipeline embolization device versus traditional coiling techniques BACKGROUND: Flow diversion is an effective and increasingly accepted method for endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Additionally, the public has heightened concerns regarding radiation exposure from medical procedures. This study analyzes radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during treatment of large and giant proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms with the pipeline embolization device (PED) versus traditional coiling techniques.METHODS: Radiation dose, fluoroscopy time, and contrast dye administration were retrospectively analyzed in 55 patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aneurysms >= 10 mm from petrous to superior hypophyseal ICA segments. Patients were treated by either PED (37 patients) or traditional coiling techniques (18 patients). Aortic arch type and proximal ICA tortuosity were also assessed as markers of access difficulty.RESULTS: Average radiation dose with PED treatment was 2840 +/- 213 mGy and 4010 +/- 708 mGy with traditional coiling techniques (p=0.048; 29% decrease with PED). Mean fluoroscopy time for PED was 56.1 +/- 5.0 min and 85.9 +/- 11.9 min for coiling cases (p=0.0087; 35% decrease with PED). These benefits existed despite more difficult arch anatomy and a trend towards greater proximal vessel tortuosity in PED cases. Contrast dye amounts were also reduced by 37.5% in PED cases (75 +/- 6 mL) versus coiling cases (120 +/- 13 mL, p=0.0008).CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of large and giant proximal ICA aneurysms using PED requires less radiation, less fluoroscopy time, and less contrast administration than standard coiling techniques. This further demonstrates the benefits of flow diversion for treatment of these aneurysms.",Excluded
1141,"[Symptomatic stenoses of the middle cerebral artery] The clinical angiographic and prognostic features of 13 patients with symptomatic stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) admitted between 1970 and 1981 have been reviewed. The etiology of the stenosis was probably atherosclerosis, except in 1 case due to fibro-muscular dysplasia, 1 with post-radiation angiopathy and 2 related to oral contraceptives. Two main clinical groups were delineated: 1) transitory and minor ischemic accidents always arising in the same arterial area; these occurred in older patients with multiples atheromatous lesions along the carotid artery. 2) progressive--or stepwise--strokes occurring in younger patients, mainly females, with isolated MCA stenosis. These cerebrovascular symptoms and signs, in the absence of carotid bruit, Doppler ultrasonography abnormality or evidence of cardiac embolism should suggest intracranial stenosis and require appropriate therapy to avoid complete occlusion. Our study shows that early medical treatment--anti-coagulation, then antiaggregation--provides a suitable alternative to EC/IC bypass. This is suggested by evidence for micro-embolization in addition to hemodynamic mechanisms.",Excluded

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of different concurrent chemotherapy regimens in the context.METHODS: A total of 225 patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC were included. Patients who were treated with weekly docetaxel-platin (DP), paclitaxel-platin (PP) and standard dose etoposide-platin (EP) chemotherapy regimens were selected and divided into groups for the comparison of toxicity, response rate, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) times.RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between overall response rate of each treatment groups (DP: 96.1%, PP: 94% and EP: 76.7%, p < 0.001). The median PFS time of patients who were treated with DP, PP and EP was 16, 15 and 13.3 months, respectively (p = 0.435). The median OS time of patients treated with DP, PP and EP was 19.2, 29.7 and 28.3 months, respectively (p < 0.001).

In this study, we investigated the effects of IR on the differentiation of Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells and the involvement of tumor protein 53 (p53) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) during this process.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells were exposed to (137)Cs gamma-rays at 4, 8 or 16 Gy. After incubation for 72 h with or without inhibitors of p53, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and other kinases, the neuronal differentiation of irradiated Neuro-2a cells was examined through analyzing neurite outgrowth and neuronal maker expression and the activation of related signaling proteins by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Mouse primary neural stem cells (NSC) were exposed to IR at 1 Gy. The change of neuronal marker was examined using immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: The irradiation of Neuro-2a cells significantly increased the neurite outgrowth and the expression of neuronal markers (neuronal nuclei [NeuN], microtubule-associated protein 2 [Map2], growth associated protein-43 [GAP-43], and Ras-related protein 13 [Rab13]). Immunocytochemistry revealed that neuronal class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1) positive cells were increased and nestin positive cells were decreased by IR in Neuro-2a cells, which supported the IR-induced neuronal differentiation. However, the IR-induced neuronal differentiation was significantly attenuated when p53 was inhibited by pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) or p53-small interfering RNA (siRNA). The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, also suppressed the IR-induced neurite outgrowth, the activation of p53, the expression of GAP-43 and Rab13, and the increase of Tuj-1 positive cells. The increase of neurite outgrowth and Tuj-1 positive cells by IR and its suppression by LY294002 were also observed in mouse primary NSC.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IR is able to trigger the neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells and the activation of p53 via PI3K is an important step for the IR-induced differentiation of Neuro-2a cells.",Included

337,"Dopamine releasing effect of phenylbiguanide in rat striatal slices The present study explored the mechanisms underlying the dopamine releasing effect of phenylbiguanide, a compound commonly used as a 5-HT3 receptor agonist. Phenylbiguanide, and also serotonin and 2-methyl-serotonin, enhanced the outflow of radioactivity from superfused rat striatal slices preloaded with [3H]dopamine. The presence of the dopamine uptake blocker nomifensin prevented the increase in outflow. The effect of phenylbiguanide was not antagonized by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, did not require the presence of Ca2+ in the superfusion buffer, and also occurred in reserpinized preparations with depleted dopamine stores. Phenylbiguanide caused a greater shift in the distribution of superfusate radioactivity from DOPAC to dopamine than did nomifensin. All these results are in agreement with an exchange mechanism by which phenylbiguanide promotes the efflux of dopamine by operation of the uptake carrier in the reversed direction. In consonance, phenylbiguanide, and also serotonin and 2-methyl-serotonin, inhibited the binding of [3H]CFT to dopamine uptake sites, although the rank order for promoting outflow, serotonin greater than phenylbiguanide greater than 2-methyl-serotonin, differed from that for inhibiting [3H]CFT binding to dopamine uptake sites, 2-methylserotonin approximately serotonin greater than phenylbiguanide. The present results raised the possibility that phenylbiguanide has an additional activity in releasing vesicular dopamine into the cytoplasmic pool.",Excluded

31,"Potential role of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of tumors of the maxillary sinus Purpose: To assess 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques to see whether doses to critical structures could be reduced while maintaining planning target volume (PTV) coverage in patients receiving conventional radiotherapy (RT) for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus because of the risk of radiation-induced complications, particularly visual loss. Methods and Materials: Six patients who had recently received conventional RT for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus were studied. Conventional RT, 3D-CRT, and step-and-shoot IMRT plans were prepared using the same 2-field arrangement. The effect of reducing the number of segments in the IMRT beams was investigated. Result(s): 3D-CRT and IMRT reduced the brain and ipsilateral parotid gland doses compared with the conventional plans. IMRT reduced doses to both optic nerves; for the contralateral optic nerve, 15-segment IMRT plans delivered an average maximal dose of 56.4 Gy (range 53.9-59.3) compared with 65.7 Gy (range 65.3-65.9) and 64.2 Gy (range 61.4-65.6) for conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. IMRT also gave improved PTV homogeneity and improved coverage, with an average of 8.5% (range 7.0-11.7%) of the volume receiving <95% of the prescription dose (64 Gy) compared with 14.7% (range 14.1-15.9%) and 15.1% (range 14.4-16.1%) with conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Little difference was found between the 15 and 7-segment plans, but 5 segments resulted in a reduced minimal PTV dose. Conclusion(s): IMRT offers significant advantages over conventional RT and 3D-CRT techniques for treatment of maxillary sinus tumors. Good results can be obtained from 7 segments per beam without compromising the PTV coverage. This number of segments is practical for implementation in a busy RT department. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

Phase 2 determined whether this combination improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in GBM recursive partitioning analysis class III to V patients compared to therapies for recently published historical controls.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose escalation in phase 1 progressed through 3 cohorts until 2 of 6 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity or a dose of 5 mg/kg was reached. Once MTD was established, a 1-sided 1-sample log-rank test at significance level of .1 had 85% power to detect a median survival difference (13.69 vs 18.48 months) with 60 deaths over a 12-month accrual period and an additional 18 months of follow-up. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: In phase 1, 24 patients were enrolled. The MTD established was 5 mg/kg, given intravenously 5 days a week for the first 10 RT fractions, then 3 times a week for the duration of RT. The 7 patients enrolled in the third dose level and the 94 enrolled in phase 2 received this dose. Of these 101 patients, 87 were eligible and evaluable. Median survival time was 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.9-17.6 months), not significantly different from that of the historical control (P=.36). Median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.7-9.6 months). One patient (1%) experienced a grade 5 adverse event possibly related to therapy during the concurrent phase, and none experience toxicity during adjuvant TMZ therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment was well tolerated, but median OS did not reach improvement specified by protocol compared to historical control, indicating that the combination of standard RT with TMZ and MGd did not achieve a significant survival advantage.",Excluded

Furthermore, brain-metastasis incidence is rising due to the increasing survival of patients with cancer. Our aim was to analyze the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife (CK) radiosurgery for elderly patients.METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients with brain metastases >= 65 years old treated with CK-SRS at our institution since 2011 and analyzed data of primary diseases, multimodality treatments, and local therapy effect based on imaging follow-up and treatment safety. Kaplan-Meier analysis for local progression-free interval and overall survival were performed.RESULTS: We identified 97 patients (233 lesions) fulfilling the criteria at the first CK-SRS. The mean age was 73.2 +/- 5.8 (range: 65.0-87.0) years. Overall, 13.4% of the patients were > 80 years old. The three most frequent primary cancers were lung (40.2%), kidney (22.7%), and malignant melanoma (15.5%). In 38.5% (47/122 treatments) multiple brain metastases were treated with the CK-SRS, with up to eight lesions in one session. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 1.05 (range: 0.01-19.80) cm<sup>3</sup>. A single fraction was applied in 92.3% of the lesions with a median prescription dose of 19 (range: 12-21) Gy. The estimated overall survivals at 3-, 6-, and 12 months after SRS were 79, 55, and 23%, respectively. The estimated local tumor progression-free intervals at 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 72 months after SRS were 99.2, 89.0, 67.2, 64.6, and 64.6%, respectively. Older age and female sex were predictive factors of local progression. The Karnofsky performance score remained stable in 97.9% of the patients; only one patient developed a neurological deficit after SRS of a cerebellar lesion (ataxia, CTCAE Grade 2).CONCLUSIONS: SRS is a safe and efficient option for the treatment of elderly patients with brain metastases with good local control rates without the side effects of WBRT. Older age and female sex seem to be predictive factors of local progression. Prospective studies are warranted to clarify the role of SRS treatment for elderly patients.",Excluded
174,"Neuronal precursors within the adult rat subventricular zone differentiate into dopaminergic neurons after substantia nigra lesion and chromaffin cell transplant Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain continues in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Neuronal precursors from the SVZ migrate along the rostral migratory stream to replace olfactory bulb interneurons. After the destruction of the nigro-striatal pathway (SN-lesion), some SVZ precursors begin to express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuronal markers (NeuN). Grafting of chromaffin cells (CCs) into the denervated striatum increases the number of TH+ cells (SVZ TH+ cells; Arias-Carrion et al., 2004). This study examines the functional properties of these newly differentiating TH+ cells. Under whole-cell patch-clamp, most SVZ cells recorded from lesioned and grafted animals (either TH+ or TH-) were non-excitable. Nevertheless, a small percentage of SVZ TH+ cells had the electrophysiologic phenotype of mature dopaminergic neurons and showed spontaneous postsynaptic potentials. Dopamine (DA) release was measured in SVZ and striatum from both control and SN-lesioned rats. As expected, 12 weeks after SN lesion, DA release decreased drastically. Nevertheless, 8 weeks after CCs graft, release from the SVZ of SN-lesioned rats recovered, and even surpassed that from control SVZ, suggesting that newly formed SVZ TH+ cells release DA. This study shows for the first time that in response to SN-lesions and CC grafts neural precursors within the SVZ change their developmental program, by not only expressing TH, but more importantly by acquiring excitable properties of mature dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, the release of DA in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and the attraction of synaptic afferents from neighboring neuronal networks gives further significance to the overall findings, whose potential importance is discussed.",Excluded
686,"Acute complications following gamma knife radiosurgery are rare BACKGROUND: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) is a safe and effective alternative to surgery for intracranial lesions. Most studies evaluating toxicity after GKR have concentrated on the delayed radiation effects.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 835 consecutive GKR cases for early (within 7 days) neurological complications or death.RESULTS: We identified a total of 18 patients (2.2%) who had a neurological event or death. Five (0.6%) patients developed new focal deficits, 12 (1.4%) patients experienced a seizure and there were three (0.4%) deaths. Two deaths were related to development of seizures and neurological deterioration. One death was caused by a respiratory arrest related to the patient's primary cancer. Of the five patients with neurological deficits, none had a persistent deficit. In two cases the neurological deficits were due to an increase in edema. Whether this occurred as a result of the gamma knife treatment or was the natural progression of the tumor is unclear.CONCLUSIONS: Complications after GKR are uncommon and the risk of a permanent deficit arising from an acute neurological event is exceedingly low.",Excluded
838,"The effects of 1 Hz rTMS over the hand area of M1 on movement kinematics of the ipsilateral hand 1 Hz rTMS applied over primary motor cortex (M1) reduces cortical excitability outlasting the stimulation period. Healthy right-handed subjects performed finger and hand tapping and a reach-to-grasp movement prior to (baseline) and after 1 Hz rTMS applied over (1) M1 of either the right or the left hemisphere, and (2) the vertex (control stimulation). 1 Hz rTMS applied over the left M1, but not over the vertex, improved movement kinematics of finger and hand tapping as well as grasping with the left hand. 1 Hz rTMS applied over the right M1, but not over the vertex, improved only the kinematics of hand tapping performed with the right hand. These data suggest that 1 Hz rTMS induced inhibition of ipsilateral M1 reduces transcallosal inhibition of contralateral M1 and thereby improves motor performance at the ipsilateral hand. The impact on motor performance of the ipsilateral hand is most pronounced after 1 Hz rTMS over the left M1.",Excluded

Vouche et al. showed a comparable effect following right lobe radiation lobectomy with glass microspheres. Unlike PVE, radiation lobectomy has the potential advantage of simultaneous tumor control. Right lobe selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres, Sydney, Australia) is hypothesized to induce similar volumetric changes in the liver at 3 and 6 months (m), while also providing directed therapy to the right liver. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients (mean age 62 y, 8M, 7F) with unilobar disease were treated with right lobar SIRT utilizing resin microspheres (mean dose 34.1 mCi, range 11-80) between September 2009 and December 2013. Neoplasm types included hepatocellular (n=5), cholangiocarcinoma (n=4), metastatic colon (n=2), gallbladder (n=1), appendiceal (n=1), thyroid (n=1) and neuroendocrine (n=1). Total liver volumes, lobar volumes, FLR, and % of FLR hypertrophy from baseline (%FLR) were assessed prior to and after right lobar SIRT at 3m and 6m follow-up utilizing CT or MRI. Result(s): Follow-up imaging was available for 13/15 patients at 3m and 11/15 patients at 6m. Left lobe hypertrophy was seen at 3m (p=0.002) and 6m (p=0.003). Right lobe atrophy was also seen at 3m (p=0.02) and 6m (p=0.04). FLR hypertrophy was seen at both time points: 29.1% (range, 2.5-46.5, p=0.003) at 3m and 30.7% (range, 2.8-62.8, p=0.003) at 6m.

442,"The influence of narrow-and broad-band UVB radiation on the epidermis apoptosis in experimental animals Studies on apoptosis and the influence of UVB radiation on this process have important cognitive aspects. They are a source of information about the interaction between the ultraviolet radiation and the biological material. The purpose of the study was to compare the narrow- and broad-band UVB radiation in terms of its influence on the epidermis apoptosis in experimental animals. Immunohistochemically, the number of apoptosis cells was counted in the epidermis. In 6 consecutive fields of vision measuring 82.4 mum x 82.4 mum, the number of cells with positive PARP reaction was counted. They were counted in three slices in the control group and in each of the experimental groups. The results underwent statistical analysis. Percentages, arithmetic means and standard deviations were calculated. It was proved that UVB radiation leads to enhanced apoptosis in the epidermis. The largest number of apoptotic cells per a surface assessed was observed in the BB-UVB-D experimental group. In this group there were 20 times more apoptotic cells than in the controls. When the number of apoptotic cells was compared between the narrow-band irradiated group and that irradiated with the broad band of UVB, the latter was found to induce about three times more apoptotic cells than the former did. The data obtained after the analysis of the results allowed for a comparative evaluation of the both radiation wavebands, which was also important from the clinical point of view. A full understanding of the complex apoptosis process can contribute to the knowledge about the process of photocarcinogenesis and help find a possible relation between an increased risk of skin carcinogenesis and a distorted apoptotic response.",Excluded

This observation is similar to that following ionizing radiation; however, the effect is slower following the chemical treatment. Recovery of the normal cells occurs 15-18 hours after treatment, whereas the ataxia telangiectasia lines do not attain normal levels of DNA synthesis during the entire 24-hour observation period. Similar differences were not observed following treatment with mitomycin C, a bifunctional alkylating agent, indicating a specific effect of bleomycin on DNA synthesis in ataxia telangiectasia cells. Following bleomycin treatment and preincubation with hydroxyurea, residual DNA synthesis in ataxia telangiectasia cells was similar to that in both normal and xeroderma pigmentosum lymphoid cells, suggesting that the capacity to repair the induced DNA lesion is present.",Excluded

The Central Brain Tumor Registry in the USA has made a complete description of primary brain tumors available to researchers.

There are few proven causes of brain tumors: high-dose ionizing radiation, inherited genetic syndromes and AIDs-related brain lymphomas. Promising avenues of research include the role of immune function, genetic components in families, metabolic and DNA-repair pathways and neurocarcinogen exposures. [References: 104]",Excluded
518,"Retinal bipolar cells: temporal filtering of signals from cone photoreceptors The temporal dynamics of the response of neurons in the outer retina were investigated by intracellular recording from cones, bipolar, and horizontal cells in the intact, light-adapted retina of the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), with special emphasis on comparing the two major classes of bipolars cells, the ON depolarizing bipolars (Bd) and the OFF hyperpolarizing bipolars (Bh). Transfer functions were computed from impulse responses evoked by a brief light flash on a steady background of 20 cd/m(2). Phase delays ranged from about 89 ms for cones to 170 ms for Bd cells, yielding delays relative to that of cones of about 49 ms for Bh cells and 81 ms for Bd cells. The difference between Bd and Bh cells, which may be due to a delay introduced by the second messenger G-protein pathway unique to Bd cells, was further quantified by latency measurements and responses to white noise. The amplitude transfer functions of the outer retinal neurons varied with light adaptation in qualitative agreement with results for other vertebrates and human vision. The transfer functions at 20 cd/m(2) were predominantly low pass with 10-fold attenuation at about 13, 14, 9.1, and 7.7 Hz for cones, horizontal, Bh, and Bd cells, respectively. The transfer function from the cone voltage to the bipolar voltage response, as computed from the above measurements, was low pass and approximated by a cascade of three low pass RC filters (""leaky integrators""). These results for cone-->bipolar transmission are surprisingly similar to recent results for rod-->bipolar transmission in salamander slice preparations. These and other findings suggest that the rate of vesicle replenishment rather than the rate of release may be a common factor shaping synaptic signal transmission from rods and cones to bipolar cells.",Excluded

The mass responded, but granulocytopenia developed. Bone marrow examination showed a myeloid to erythroid ratio of approximately 1:1, with a left shift within the myeloid line. These findings, as well as the lack of toxic changes within the peripheral blood neutrophils, suggested immune-mediated destruction of peripheral granulocytes.

300,"Patient perceptions of computed tomographic imaging and their understanding of radiation risk and exposure STUDY OBJECTIVE: We describe patient perceptions of computed tomography (CT) and their understanding of radiation exposure and risk.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of acute abdominal pain patients aged 18 years or older. Confidence in medical evaluations with increasing levels of laboratory testing and imaging was rated on a 100-point visual analog scale. Knowledge of radiation exposure was ascertained when participants compared the radiation dose of one abdomen-pelvis CT with 2-view chest radiography. To assess cancer risk knowledge, participants rated their agreement with these factual statements: ""Approximately 2 to 3 abdominal CTs give the same radiation exposure as experienced by Hiroshima survivors"" and ""2 to 3 abdominal CTs over a person's lifetime can increase cancer risk."" Previous CT was also assessed.RESULTS: There were 1,168 participants, 67% women and mean age 40.7 years (SD 15.9 years). Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor. Median agreement with the Hiroshima statement was 13 (95% CI 10 to 16) and 45 (95% CI 40 to 45) with the increased lifetime cancer risk statement. Seven hundred ninety-five patients reported receiving a previous CT.

1182,"Evaluation of Lower-Dose Spiral Head CT for Detection of Intracranial Findings Causing Neurologic Deficits BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the frequent use of unenhanced head CT for the detection of acute neurologic deficit, the radiation dose for this exam varies widely. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of lower-dose head CT for detection of intracranial findings resulting in acute neurologic deficit.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Projection data from 83 patients undergoing unenhanced spiral head CT for suspected neurologic deficits were collected. Cases positive for infarction, intra-axial hemorrhage, mass, or extra-axial hemorrhage required confirmation by histopathology, surgery, progression of findings, or corresponding neurologic deficit; cases negative for these target diagnoses required negative assessments by two neuroradiologists and a clinical neurologist. A routine dose head CT was obtained using 250 effective mAs and iterative reconstruction. Lower-dose configurations were reconstructed (25-effective mAs iterative reconstruction, 50-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection). Three neuroradiologists circled findings, indicating diagnosis, confidence (0-100), and image quality. The difference between the jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit at routine and lower-dose configurations was estimated. A lower 95% CI estimate of the difference greater than -0.10 indicated noninferiority.RESULTS: Forty-two of 83 patients had 70 intracranial findings (29 infarcts, 25 masses, 10 extra- and 6 intra-axial hemorrhages) at routine head CT (CT dose index = 38.3 mGy). The routine-dose jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81-0.93). Noninferiority was shown for 100-effective mAs iterative reconstruction (figure of merit difference, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.004) and 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection (-0.02; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.02) but not for 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection (-0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02) or lower-dose levels. Image quality was better at higher-dose levels and with iterative reconstruction (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Observer performance for dose levels using 100-200 eff mAs was noninferior to that observed at 250 effective mAs with iterative reconstruction, with iterative reconstruction preserving noninferiority at a mean CT dose index of 15.2 mGy.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: To date, no symptomatic forms of epicrania fugax (EF) have been reported. Here, we describe the first EF-type pain to be probably caused by an underlying disorder.CASE REPORT: A 77-year-old woman started suffering from left V1-V2 trigeminal neuralgia at 72 years of age. Neurologic examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a left middle sphenoid wing meningioma compressing the left trigeminal nerve medially. After trying several neuromodulators, she received stereotactic radiotherapy. One month later, the episodes of facial pain were significantly diminished, but she started feeling brief electric paroxysms across her left hemicranium that were clinically identical to those of backwards EF. Serial MRI showed persistence of the meningioma without changes.CONCLUSION: Although the pathogenesis of EF remains uncertain, this case is consistent with a symptomatic origin in the trigeminal root/pathway. The onset of the EF-like pain could have been caused by the compressive effect of the tumour or, most likely, by the radiation.",Excluded

Various factors may preclude patients from undergoing DBS and for them, non-invasive lesion-based therapies such as focused ultrasound and Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery may present a safer alternative.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on preliminary positive reports of STN GK for PD, we conducted a prospective, open-label, single-center, pilot study in PD patients deemed potential candidates for unilateral DBS based on their disease characteristics, but contraindicated due to age >74, an irreversible bleeding diathesis, or significant comorbid medical disease. Stereotactic MRI-guided GK radiosurgery was performed using a single 110- or 120-Gy dose targeting the STN contralateral to the more symptomatic extremity. Clinical follow-up and imaging assessed the safety and efficacy of the procedure over a 12-month period.RESULTS: Four PD patients with medication-refractory tremors and disabling dyskinesias underwent unilateral STN GK radiosurgery. Contraindications to DBS included high-risk comorbid cardiovas-cular disease in 3 patients and an irreversible bleeding diathesis in 1. There were no immediate post-procedural adverse events. One patient who underwent left STN GK radiosurgery developed right hemiparesis and dysarthria 7 months post-procedure followed by hospitalization at 9 months for bacterial endocarditis and liver failure from which he died. The remaining 3 patients were free of adverse events up to 12 months post-procedure and experienced a reduction in contralateral rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. Upon extended follow-up, 2 patients developed subacute worsening of gait. One died at 16 months due to complications of a fall whereas the other saw no change in gait up to 42 months post-procedure. All 3 patients with adverse events demonstrated a hyper-response in the targeted area on follow-up neuroimaging.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Despite the potential for clinical improvement, our results suggest that unilateral STN GK radiosurgery should be approached cautiously in medically frail PD patients who may be at higher risk of GK hyper-response and neurologic complications.",Excluded

These two modes of repair were characterized and compared between the aforementioned EPF, A. niger and N. crassa using a physiological assay where per cent survival post-UV irradiation was scored as colony forming units.CONCLUSIONS: The results showed B. bassiana and M. anisopliae are the most UV-tolerant EPF. The DNA repair capabilities indicated that EPF do not have all DNA repair options available to fungi, such as A. niger and N. crassa.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A key factor detrimental to the survival of EPF in agro-ecosystems is UV light from solar radiation.

339,"Advanced radiation therapy plan for glm based on FMRI Purpose: Following radical radiotherapy (RT), high graDe gliomas such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) frequently recur within the high dose volume and it is plausible that conventional planning margins might be reduced without a loss of local tumour control. Akin to the current evaluation of reduction in the dose delivered to the hippocampal and limbic systems to reduce radiationrelated memory impairment, other uninvolved critical functional cerebral areas should be spared to minimise the potential acute and late toxicities of radiation therapy. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of speech centre localisation using functional MRI (fMRI) on the RT planning process in GBM. Materials: Language function was activated in a 68-year old male with a right fronto-parietal GBM using a 'word generation' task. Block designed blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI was applied (1.5 T Siemens Avanto scanner) during lingual stimulation [1]. BOLD-clusters were assessed individually for anatomical localization. fMRI was performed using EPI sequence and T1-weighted anatomical 3D VIBE sequence was used for functional image analysis and overlay [1]. The functional image analysis and overlay procedures were performed using BrainVoyager (BrainInnovationBV, Maastricht, The Netherlands). A CT scan (Siemens Open Sensation) was performed to delineate the radiation target volume and organs at risk (OAR) (Fig 1A). The fusion of the 3-D anatomical and functional datasets (CT+fMRI) as well as the segmentation of the radiation target volume was achieved using Siemens Oncology workstation (Fig. 1B). The speech centres were defined as OARs in the IMRT planning process (mean 45 Gy, max. 50 Gy) (Fig. 1C). The treatment plan (Pinnacle 8.0m TPS, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) was not used clinically and the patient was informed. Result(s): Speech activation areas and the GBM (as defined on the T1 MRI images) could be visualised separately. The plan did not compromise any other constraint and spared the critical structures. The mean and maximum doses to the PTV (60 Gy prescribed to 100%) were 61.97 Gy and 69.47 Gy respectively. Broca's area was partially within the PTV, however the mean and maximum doses to Wernicke's area were 36 Gy and 52.81 Gy (Fig. 1C). Figure 1.

Bone metastases can be associated with SREs, which include pathologic fracture, need for surgery or radiation to bone, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. The aim is to investigate prospectively the incidence of BM, the incidence and types of SREs, time interval between BM and SREs, influence of SREs on QOL, and predictive factor of SREs. Method(s): Eligibility criteria were a newly diagnosed pt with stage IIIB or IV lung cancer, age over 20 years old, written informed consent. Staging of lung cancer required CT scan of the whole body, bone scan or PET, and CT or MRI of the brain. Pts were closely followed up every 4 weeks to see if they developed SREs. During the follow up period, the pts underwent CT scan every 4 weeks, CT or MRI of the brain and bone scan or PET every 6 months.

Under hypothermia, the protein-synthesizing system was shown to be damaged to a lesser degree and to be restored faster in comparison with similar neurons in rats irradiated at room temperature. In rats irradiated under hypothermia, the rRNA biogenesis and the protein-synthesizing activity of polyribosomes were restored in two days.

992,"When a headache isn't just a headache: A case of tolosa-hunt syndrome Background: First described by Tolosa in 1954 as painful opthalmoplegia, consisting of periorbital or hemi-cranial pain combined with ipsilateral third, fourth and/or sixth nerve palsies. Caused by a granulomatous inflammation within the cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure or orbit1. Hunt et al. in 1961, noted the therapeutic efficacy of corticosteroids in this condition. Inflammation can extend beyond the cavernous sinus affecting the maxillary and mandibular branch of the trigeminal and the facial nerve2. Case: A 34-year-old female, presented with headache and diplopia. The headache was left sided, occipital and intermittent with radiation to the left eye. Eight days prior to presentation the patient developed blurring of the vision in the left eye and pain described as being in the left 'eye socket'. Referred from the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital with left sided ptosis, left 3rd nerve palsy and binocular diplopia. No change in sensation. Imaging was carried out; MRI brain showed a pseudo-obstruction orbital inflammatory tumour. CT angiogram showed changes at the left orbital apex to the superior ophthalmic fissure and into the left cavernous sinus. Once commenced on prednisolone the patient had immediate improvement in symptoms. Discussion(s): This case highlights a typical presentation. Incidence is estimated as one per million3. Awide list of differentials for painful opthalmoplegia should be considered including; trauma, vascular malformation, neoplasm, infection and inflammation. Painful opthalmoplegia can also be affected by giant cell arteritis, opthalmoplegic migraine or diabetic opthalmoplegia2. Recurrence occurs in 30-40%. A self-limiting disease; the symptoms of which are improved dramatically by corticosteroids. Conclusion(s): As there are no known triggers of the inflammation, the syndrome often falls into the category of idiopathic orbital inflammation (pseudo tumour). The syndrome effects all ages and occurs equally in both sexes. It is important that Tolosa-Hunt syndrome remains a differential diagnosis of painful opthalmoplegia.",Excluded

Measurements of contrast transit time on DSA were calculated with 2D parametric parenchymal blood flow software. Values were obtained proximally and distally to the stenotic region. Venous Stenosis Index (VSI) was defined as the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) in the pre-stenotic vessel to the AUC in the post-stenotic vessel. VSI was compared between the stenotic and control groups at baseline, and before and after stent deployment in the stenotic group. The accuracy of VSI was assessed using the non-parametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results 11 patients with IVSS treated with venous stent deployment were included. Patients in the control group were similar in age, gender, and absence of major comorbidities. VSI in the IVSS group was significantly higher at baseline compared with the control group (1.42 vs 0.97, p=0.01). Area under the ROC was 0.82. After stent deployment, VSI decreased significantly compared with baseline (1.04 vs 1.42, p<0.01). Conclusion 2D parametric parenchymal blood flow software is a useful tool which can accurately evaluate significant hemodynamic venous stenosis without intracranial catheterization, added radiation exposure, additional contrast injection, and periprocedural risks.

65,"Models of bystander signalling between primary astrocytes and glioma cells: Effects on survival and migration/invasion INTRODUCTION: The goal of radiotherapy is to cause cell death in the targeted tumour field and minimize toxicity to the surrounding normal tissue. However, malignant gliomas are highly resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Recent data suggest migration/invasion is up-regulated as a counterproductive effect of IR. In addition to direct IR effects, non-targeted radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE), observed beyond the targeted field, can cause significant cell death of the tumour and surrounding normal tissues. Little is known of how RIBE modulates glioma migration/invasion. METHOD(S): RIBE of 10 astrocytes and glioma cells grown as single and cocultures in 2D (monolayer) and 3D matrices was investigated, using media transferred from irradiated cultures and in half-exposed/shielded cultures. Nuclear 53BP1 foci were used as a surrogateDNA damage marker and transwell assays to quantitate migration/invasion. Two3D models were developed to study gliospheres in: (i) collagen matrices with/without astrocytes and (ii) mouse brain slice cultures. RESULT(S): RIBE signals from IR and non-IR glioma cultures both decreased astrocyte clonogenic survival.Weobserved increased DNA damage in astrocyte and glioma bystander cells in 2D and 3D cultures. Bystander cells had increased p38-MAPK, Connexin 43, and COX-2signalling. Direct IR induced an increase and RIBE a decrease in transwell migration. Experiments of gliosphere migration/invasion in 3D models are underway. CONCLUSION(S): These results may have implications for tumour-normal tissue margin interactions. By comparing differential molecular factors involved in the RIBE, we aim to find targets to enhance glioma cell death and inhibit migration/invasion, while preserving normal tissue.",Excluded

875,"Prior electrical stimulation of dorsal periaqueductal grey matter or deep layers of the superior colliculus sensitizes rats to anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated T-maze test Electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal grey matter (DPAG) and deep layers of the superior colliculus (DLSC) of the rat elicits anxiety-like reactions such as freezing and flight. The temporal course of the effects of the aversive electrical stimulation of the DPAG (5, 15 and 30 min afterward) and DLSC (5, 10 and 15 min afterward) on the defensive response of rats exposed to elevated T-maze were determined. The elevated T-maze generates two defensive behaviors, inhibitory avoidance and one-way escape, which have been related, respectively, to generalized anxiety and panic disorders. Prior electrical stimulation of the DPAG (15 min) and DLSC (5 min) enhanced inhibitory avoidance when compared to no-operated and sham animals, although not affecting escape. Therefore, stimulation of the DPAG and DLSC causes a heightened responsivity to anxiogenic stimulus, but not to panicogenic stimulus, inherent to elevated T-maze. These findings support the participation of the DPAG and DLSC in the elaboration of adaptive responses to stressful situations. Besides, the data supports the view that prior electrical stimulation of DPAG and DLSC is selective in sensitizing rats to anxiety-like behaviors, but not to panic-like behaviors in the elevated T-maze test.",Excluded
220,"Fatty fish intake decrease multiple sclerosis risk among people exposed to low levels of ultraviolet radiation Background: The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship between intake of fatty fish and risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Method(s): This study is based on the ongoing project Epidemiological Investigation of MS (EIMS) which is a population-based case-control study, comprising the general population aged 16-70 years in defined areas of Sweden. The present analysis involved 1404 incident cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) and 3097 controls, randomly selected from the study base, with consideration taken to age, gender, and residential area. The incidence of MS among people who reported high intake of fatty fish the last five years before inclusion in the study was compared with the incidence among people who reported low fatty fish intake. Adjustments were made for education level, smoking status, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure habits, body mass index (BMI), vitamin D intake from dairy products and intake of lean fish. We performed sub group analyses stratifying for sun exposure habits, ancestry and gender. Finding(s): Subjects who reported fatty fish intake 1-7 times per week had a slightly decreased risk of multiple sclerosis compared with subjects who reported less intake of fatty fish (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.1). In subgroup analyses among subjects who reported low UVR exposure, frequent fatty fish intake significantly decreased the risk of multiple sclerosis (adjusted OR 0.6 (95 CI 0.5-0.9), whereas among subjects who reported high UVR exposure, this was not seen (adjusted OR 1.1 95% CI 0.8-1.4). Interpretation(s): Fatty fish intake seems to decrease multiple sclerosis risk among people with low UVR light exposure. A hypothetical explanation is that intake of fatty fish, with relatively high vitamin D content, is a substitute for lack of vitamin D due to low UVR exposure. This gives further strength to the hypothesis of the importance of vitamin D for the development of multiple sclerosis.

We studied 12 thymectomized patients affected with chronic generalized severe myasthenia gravis. All patients had been totally or partially refractory to prolonged oral treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, and most had contra-indications for these drugs. Low-dose (1.8- to 2.3-Gy total dose) TBI was administered in single, 0.1-Gy doses, two to three times per week. TBI was well tolerated and was associated with objective clinical improvement in six patients, lasting more than 2 years in five. In addition, TBI produced a long-lasting lymphopenia with a pronounced decrease of T CD4+ lymphocytes; T CD8+ lymphocytes were almost unchanged over the 2 years of the study. CD16+ and CD20+ lymphocytes, after an initial decrease, increased above baseline. TBI was also associated with decreased anti-AChR antibody titer. The decrease of lymphocyte count and of anti-AChR antibody titer was more pronounced in the patients who improved, suggesting that lymphopenia and immunosuppression may have contributed to clinical improvement.",Excluded

It was concluded that following 9.0 Gy <sup>60</sup>Co-gamma irradiation, the serotonin amount significantly decreased in the brain after 1 hr of irradiation, while this amount increased in metabolite which might in our supposition be the result of the metabolising enzyme - the monoaminoxidase activity increase.

644,"Locus coeruleus activation by foot shock or electrical stimulation inhibits amygdala neurons The noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) has a direct projection to the basal lateral amygdala (BLA). Behavioral, lesion and pharmacological studies suggest that this pathway has an important role in mediating responses to emotional stimuli and in the formation of long term memory. The effect of LC activation on the activity of BLA neurons in vivo is not known. Therefore, in the present experiments, simultaneous extracellular unit recordings were made in the two regions while the anesthetized rat received electrical stimulation of the paw to simulate a real-life acute stressor, commonly used as an aversive reinforcer in conditioning experiments. All LC neurons exhibited a multiphasic excitatory response followed by prolonged inhibition. Responses of BLA cells were more heterogeneous, but predominantly inhibitory, with a release from inhibition during the refractory phase of LC. Direct electrical stimulation of the LC with a single pulse also elicited an inhibitory response in BLA. BLA response to both footshock and LC stimulation was partially blocked by the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, timolol, infused into the BLA. These experiments are the first to report in vivo effects of activation of the noradrenergic system on neuronal activity in the BLA.",Excluded
319,"Effect of low dose radiation on cognition, cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status Radiation exposure has multiple effects on the brain, behaviour and cognitive functions. These changes depend largely on the dose received and time. While high radiation doses can cause severe tissue destruction, lower doses can induce cognitive impairments without signs of overt tissue damage. Radiation-induced cognitive impairments are reported to occur in up to 50-90% of adult brain tumour patients who survive more than 6 months post-irradiation. This study was undertaken to assess the acute effects of low doses of radiation on cognitive functions, serum cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status, 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice received either sham treatment or irradiation (0.5, 1 and 3 Gy) and were tested for the alterations in the normal behaviour within 10 days. And a blood Serotonin and cortisol analysis was carried out using ELISA kits. Results obtained were analysed using one-way ANOVA. There was a significant decline in exploratory activity of mice exposed to 3 Gy and 1 Gy radiation in open field test. We observed a significant decline in spontaneous Percent Alternation indicating the short-term memory loss in 3 Gy and 1 Gy irradiated mice in Y-Maze. 1 and 3 Gy irradiated mice exhibited increased anxiety in EPM. The increased anxiety and memory loss patterns were also seen in 0.5 Gy irradiated mice, but the results were statistically not significant. The changes to cortisol level were in a dose dependent manner and serotonin levels decreased with dose. Total antioxidant levels also showed the decreasing trend with respect to radiation doses, this pattern is similar to the pattern of cognitive decline shown in behaviour analysis suggesting that the antioxidant status maybe co-related to the radiation induced cognitive decline.

470,"The contribution of imaging-based treatment planning quality assurance rounds in head and neck radiotherapy planning Purpose/Objective(s): While standard guidelines for Intensity Modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may assist in target delineation for some head and neck (HN) cancers, the complex anatomy, varying patterns of spread, frequent occurrence of unusual or advanced presentations, and risk of treatment-related toxicities from overly generous delineation render HN treatment planning (TP) very challenging. Since 2007 we have had weekly Treatment Planning Quality Assurance (TPQA) rounds with radiation oncologists and a specialized diagnostic neuroradiologist present to review TP contours for all new patients. This study quantifies the impact of this process. Materials/Methods: From 8/2010 - 2/2011, IMRT contours for 84 consecutively treated HN cancer patients were reviewed. Almost always, pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reviewed independently and fused in multiple orientations to the computed tomography TP scan using a commercial software package; thus the contours could be viewed by the group directly opposed to the MRI if desired. Pre- and post-TPQA rounds contours were saved. For this study, the pre- and post-TPQA contours were compared to record alterations in the coverage of major components (gross tumor, clinical target volume (CTV), lymph nodes, perineural invasion, or bone invasion) and the volume of change. Result(s): The tumors were mostly advanced stage (III-IV) and included various subsites: oral cavity (21%), oropharynx (19%), sinonasal (12%), skin (12%), nasopharynx (10%), salivary gland (8%), and hypopharynx (6%). Of the 84 cases, 47 (56%) were altered, including: CTV, 30/47 cases (64%); gross tumor, 25/47 cases (53%); lymph nodes, 7/47 (15%); perineural invasion, 6/47 (13%); and bone invasion, 3/47 (6%). The absolute volume change resulting from TPQA review ranged from -169.12 cc to 124.76 cc (0.03% to 636.88% of absolute pre-TPQAvolume), with a mean absolute change of 32.32 cc (39.48%) and a median change of 13.54 cc (8.96%). Volumes were equally likely to be increased (49%) or decreased (51%). The most frequently altered subsites were: hypopharynx (4/5, 80%), sinonasal (7/10, 70%), and skin (7/10, 70%). Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the impact of a neuroradiology-based approach to HN TPQA. Changes were suggested to half of the cases, and the changes were equally likely to increase or decrease the target volume, suggesting a balance between tumor coverage and desire to avoid toxicity. High frequencies of changes were seen in delineation of gross tumor and CTVs because of the wide applicability of these issues, but in addition, there are specific anatomic subsites with challenging patterns of infiltrative, intracranial, or perineural spread which warrant intensive imaging-based review in collaboration with a diagnostic specialist.",Excluded

868,"The heart is not necessarily empty at syncope BACKGROUND: Although extensively investigated, the mechanism(s) of post-spaceflight orthostatic intolerance has not been elucidated. Several researchers have proposed that the ""trigger"" for syncope is an empty ventricle, initiated when a hypercontractile state, possibly due to a sudden surge in epinephrine, causes the walls of the left ventricle to touch leading to a profound sympatho-inhibition and intense vagal stimulation.HYPOTHESIS: A markedly reduced left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) achieved during progressive, presyncopal-limited lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is the trigger for syncope.METHODS: Eight healthy men, age 25.1+/-1.3 yr, volunteered for the study. Changes in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and LVESV were measured, using two-dimensional echocardiography, at each stage of LBNP from rest up to presyncope (PS). Plasma venous catecholamine concentrations were measured at the end of each stage by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection.RESULTS: All subjects reached PS. Three men became bradycardic at presyncope while five remained tachycardic. LVESV decreased by 28% at PS with no evidence of ventricular cavity obliteration. Norepinephrine increased by 44% from rest to PS, but no epinephrine surge was detected (35% increase from rest to PS).CONCLUSION: These data indicate that it is possible to initiate syncope with only a 28% decrease in LVESV, and that sympatho-inhibition and bradycardia are not required elements for syncope to occur.",Excluded
201,"Enucleation versus preservation of blind eyes following plaque radiotherapy for choroidal melanoma BACKGROUND: Currently available information about patients with posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy is insufficient to determine what to do about eyes that become blind as a consequence of the tumour and its treatment. Should they be enucleated, or is ocular preservation just as good in terms of survival?METHODS: We performed a retrospective survival analysis of secondary enucleation versus ocular preservation in patients with a posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy whose irradiated eye became completely blind following that treatment. Of the 79 patients who fulfilled defined inclusion criteria, 25 underwent secondary enucleation of the blind eye, and 54 retained their irradiated blind eye.RESULTS: Most of the baseline demographic and tumour-related variables evaluated were similarly distributed between the subgroups. The 5-year, 10-year and 15-year all-cause death rates in the secondary enucleation subgroup were 24.7%, 51.5% and 52.0% respectively, and those in the ocular preservation subgroup were 7.4%, 32.9% and 48.1% respectively. In spite of the apparent slight difference between the curves, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.41, Mantel-Haenszel test).INTERPRETATION: Although a retrospective study of this type has several limitations, our results suggest that secondary enucleation is not likely to substantially improve survival of patients whose irradiated eye becomes totally blind following plaque radiotherapy for choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanoma.",Excluded

Phase 2 trials in BRCA pts as monotherapy or in unselected pts in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy have demonstrated evidence of efficacy. V plus radiation has shown promising efficacy in preclinical models and clinically in combination with WBRT. Method(s): Pts were randomized 1:1:1 to WBRT plus V 50 mg BID (V50), V 200 mg BID (V200), or P BID. Treatment began within 28 days (d) of diagnosis. Pts received 30 Gray WBRT in 10 fractions. V50, V200, or P BID was self-administered starting on d 1 of WBRT and continuing until 1 d after completion. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Survival was assessed at 2 month (m) intervals for 6 m then every 3 m (>=36 m). Pts who received >=1 dose were included in the safety analyses; AEs were compared across arms using Fisher's exact test. Result(s): 307 pts were randomized.

945,"Copper-induced conformational changes in the N-terminal domain of the Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase The Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase plays a critical role in the intracellular trafficking of copper. Mutations in this protein lead to the accumulation of a toxic level of copper in the liver, kidney, and brain followed by extensive tissue damage and death. The ATPase has a novel amino-terminal domain ( approximately 70 kDa) which contains six repeats of the copper binding motif GMTCXXC. We have expressed and characterized this domain with respect to the copper binding sites and the conformational consequences of copper binding. A detailed analysis of this domain by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has revealed that each binding site ligates copper in the +1 oxidation state using two cysteine side chains with distorted linear geometry. Analysis of copper-induced conformational changes in the amino-terminal domain indicates that both secondary and tertiary structure changes take place upon copper binding. These copper-induced conformational changes could play an important role in the function and regulation of the ATPase in vivo. In addition to providing important insights on copper binding to the protein, these results suggest a possible mechanism of copper trafficking by the Wilson disease ATPase.",Excluded
537,"Neuronavigation role in the percutaneous treatment of thoracolumbar fractures Introduction: Application of the neuronavigation techniques to the widely used percutaneous pedicle screw techniques allows to combine the traditional AP and LL intraoperatory fluoroscopy images with three-dimensional reconstruction CT images. The surgeon have very important informations about the axial plane having a real time feedback to the exact spinal surgical anatomy. This makes more ""minimally invasive"" surgical procedure and reduces patients and operators exposure to ionizing radiation. We used this technique in the treatment of Magerl's A2-A3 thoracolumbar fracture. Material(s) and Method(s): From June 2010 thru September 2012, 25 patients (16 male and 9 female) underwent surgical treatment for thoracolumbar hinge (D12-L1) fracture with a completely neuronavigated percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique using a posterior approach. Inclusions criteria were: monolevel Magerl's A2- A3 thoracolumbar fractures, no posterior wall involvement and/or fragments occupying the spinal canal for more than 25 % according to Hashimoto, McCormack score <=6 with posterior longitudinal ligament's integrity, no neurological deficits. Although the percutaneous neuronavigated techniques are widely used in different centers, in these cases also the pedicle screws were neuronavigated, to make surgical procedure more accurate and precise. The positioning of percutaneous pedicle screw was performed using Stealth 7 Medtronic (Fridley, Minnesota, USA) neuronavigation system with a completely neuronavigated surgical instruments (CD Horizon Longitude) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). In 2 cases we used real-time 3-D images acquired with O-Arm system to have a further collimation of the neuronavigated data with the acquired images reducing intraoperative fluoroscopic controls. The follow-up provided Rx study in second post-operative day and in 1 and 6 months post-op. Result(s): The percutaneous neuronavigated technique have proved to be useful for the surgeon because in addition to the traditional fluoroscopic AP and LL images, uses three-dimensional reconstruction CT images, viewing also axial projections. In cases in which we used the O-Arm, were appreciated the usefulness of the 3-D images realtime. There were no cases of surgical instrumentation's failure. The patients have been mobilized in the first post-operative day with a more rapid resolution of painful symptoms and returned to perform their work activities more quickly. The Rx post-operative controls at 6 months have demonstrated the correct positioning of the pedicle screws and the correct fusion in 95 % of patients. Conclusion(s): The percutaneously entirely neuronavigated pedicle screws fixation is an effective and safe technique for the treatment of the hinge thoraco-lumbar fractures. The technique used in carefully selected patients reduces the time required for surgery, intraoperative blood loss, and ensures greater anatomical detail making more safely the placement of pedicle screws reducing the risks of ""screw misplacement"".",Excluded
1013,"Failure to restore vision after optic nerve regeneration in reptiles: interspecies variation in response to axotomy Optic nerve regeneration within the reptiles is variable. In a snake, Viper aspis, and the lizard Gallotia galloti, regeneration is slow, although some retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons eventually reach the visual centers (Rio et al. [1989] Brain Res 479:151-156; Lang et al. [1998] Glia 23:61-74). By contrast, in a lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus, numerous RGC axons regenerate rapidly to the visual centers, but unless animals are stimulated visually, the regenerated projection lacks topography and animals remain blind via the experimental eye (Beazley et al.

A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients. No radiation colitis or neuropathy occurred. Moderate-dose IORT and EBRT is safe, taking into account related late toxicities. It is an effective local treatment approach, resulting in an encouraging local control rate.",Excluded
610,"Radiation protection by 6-palmitoyl ascorbic acid-2-glucoside: studies on DNA damage in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo and oxidative stress in vivo A palmitoyl derivative of ascorbic acid 2-glucoside, 6-palmitoyl ascorbic acid-2-glucoside (PAsAG), which possess good antioxidant properties, is examined for radioprotection in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models. PAsAG protected plasmid DNA from gamma-radiation induced damages under in vitro conditions. Presence of 1.6 mM PAsAG inhibited the disappearance of ccc (covalently closed circular) form of plasmid pBR322 with a dose modifying factor of 1.5. Comet assay studies on mouse spleen cells exposed to 6 Gy gamma-radiation (ex vivo) in presence and absence of PAsAG revealed that cellular DNA was effectively protected by this compound from radiation induced damages. Oral administration of 80 mg/kg body weight of PAsAG to mice 1 hour prior to 6 Gy whole body gamma-radiation exposure, efficiently protected cellular DNA in tissues such as spleen, bone marrow and blood, from radiation induced damages as indicated by alkaline comet assay. Oxidative stress in tissues such as liver and brain of mice, following whole body exposure to various doses of gamma-radiation (2-8 Gy), monitored as levels of GSH and peroxidation of lipids, were found considerably reduced when PAsAG was orally administered (80 mg/kg body weight) to the mice one hour prior to the radiation exposure. PAsAG administration improved the per cent survival of mice following exposure to 10 Gy whole body gamma-radiation. Thus PAsAG could act as a radioprotector under in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo conditions of ionizing-radiation exposure.",Included
802,"Prospective assessment of white matter integrity in adult stem cell transplant recipients Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is often used in the treatment of hematologic disorders. Although it can be curative, the pre-transplant conditioning regimen can be associated with neurotoxicity. In this prospective study, we examined white matter (WM) integrity with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological functioning before and one year after HSCT in twenty-two patients with hematologic disorders and ten healthy controls evaluated at similar intervals. Eighteen patients received conditioning treatment with high-dose (HD) chemotherapy, and four had full dose total body irradiation (fTBI) and HD chemotherapy prior to undergoing an allogeneic or autologous HSCT. The results showed a significant decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in diffuse WM regions one year after HSCT (p-corrected <0.05) in the patient group compared to healthy controls. At baseline, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had higher MD and AD in the left hemisphere WM than autologous HSCT patients (p-corrected <0.05). One year post-transplant, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in the right hemisphere and left frontal WM compared to patients treated with autologous HSCT (p-corrected <0.05). There were modest but significant correlations between MD values and cognitive test scores, and these were greatest for timed tests and in projection tracts. Patients showed a trend toward a decline in working memory, and had lower cognitive test scores than healthy controls at the one-year assessment. The findings suggest a relatively diffuse pattern of alterations in WM integrity in adult survivors of HSCT.",Excluded

48,"Incidence of intracranial radiation necrosis following postoperative radiation therapy for sinonasal malignancies OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Surgery and postoperative radiation therapy are commonly used in the treatment of advanced sinonasal cancer. However, post-treatment radiation changes to the brain often mimic radiologic findings suggestive of tumor recurrence, leading to potential unnecessary intracranial biopsies. The objective of this study was to determine clinical factors that predict signs of tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis in post-therapy sinonasal malignancies with intracranial extension.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.METHODS: Twenty-six patients with sinonasal malignancy with intracranial extension underwent surgery and radiation +/- chemotherapy between 2010 and 2014 at the University of Arizona. We analyzed sinonasal cancer type, stage, total radiation dosimetry, time until imaging changes, surgical pathology, associated imaging, and patient demographics.RESULTS: Thirteen of 26 patients had postoperative imaging changes seen on surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Five were deemed to have tumor recurrence due to new metastasis seen on positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan. Four patients were observed with serial imaging that confirmed pseudoprogression. In four patients, there was sufficient concern due to persistent MRI changes, which prompted surgical biopsy, and only one of them was positive for tumor recurrence. Factors that favored tumor recurrence included faster onset of imaging changes on MRI (55 vs. 186 days, P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial tumor recurrence can be difficult to distinguish between radiation necrosis in sinonasal cancers treated with surgery and postoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy. Patients with sub-total resection and rapid onset of MRI changes in postsurveillance scans are more likely to have tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis. Future imaging techniques or tests that investigate tumor biomarkers are necessary to prevent unnecessary biopsies.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 126:2445-2450, 2016.",Excluded
778,"Clinical controversies: proton radiation therapy for brain and skull base tumors Proton radiotherapy offers distinct physical properties that could lead to an improvement of dose distribution with subsequent reduction of integral dose to the patient. This supports the potential use of proton beams in tumors close to sensitive structures, such as the skull base and the brain. In the present manuscript, the literature on proton therapy for brain and skull base tumors is critically reviewed and compared with results obtained with modern photon techniques. Treatment planning comparisons demonstrate that dose distributions within the target are comparable. In terms of normal tissue dose distribution, protons offer an advantage in the intermediate- and low-dose regions, and this may result in long-term clinical benefit, although to date no randomized or long-term follow-up data demonstrate this. Considering the excellent long-term results seen with photons in localized tumors, this benefit may be modest and difficult to demonstrate. Protons may allow for safe delivery of higher local doses with the potential to improve local control in some tumors. However, improvements in photon techniques also enable safe dose escalation, and therefore, the comparison of the techniques of delivery is likely to need randomized trials. Proton therapy offers effective treatment for a range of brain tumors. However, the limited availability, the cost, and the lack of evidence of superiority mean that advanced photon radiotherapy continues to be the treatment of choice. It is hoped that advances in technology, both in proton and photon radiotherapy delivery, and increasing information on the efficacy and toxicity of the two modalities will lead to further improvement in radiotherapy approaches and provide the basis for the best choice of treatment for the individual patient.",Excluded
519,"Left transsylvian-transinsular approach for radiation-induced cavernous malformation: 3-dimensional operative video De novo cavernous malformation (CM) formation after radiation therapy for brain tumors is well known, but CM formation adjacent to a radiosurgically treated arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is rare.<sup>1</sup> This video demonstrates the microsurgical resection of a de novo CM adjacent to a previously treated high-grade AVM and clipping of a middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. A 70-yr-old male with history of radiosurgery for AVM presented with aphasia and confusion. Preoperative angiography showed complete occlusion of the AVM. MRI showed multiple cystic lesions suspicious for radiation-induced necrosis and CM. IRB approval and patient consent was obtained. A pterional craniotomy was performed with transsylvian exposure of the insula. The radiated feeding arteries were followed to the occluded AVM nidus. A CM was noted deep to this candelabra of the MCA vessels, which were mobilized to access and resect the CM. A small incision was made in this insular cortex underneath the malformation circumferentially freeing it of adhesions. The sclerotic AVM nidus was circumferentially dissected and removed en bloc. Thorough exploration of the resection cavity revealed no residual CM or AVM nidus. Attention was then turned to the M2-MCA bifurcation aneurysm, which was occluded with a straight clip. Postoperative imaging confirmed complete CM resection. The patient recovered from his aphasia. This case demonstrates the management of a radiation-induced de novo CM following treatment of a high-grade AVM. Radiographic follow-up for radiosurgically treated AVM is needed to rule out long-term complications. Bleeding from a de novo CM mimics bleeding from residual AVM nidus, requiring careful angiographic evaluation. Copyright © 2019 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded
533,"Efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anal canal Background: Development of distant metastases in SCC of the anal canal is not very common after treatment with combined modality. Only widely published data for treatment of metastatic disease is cisplatin and 5-FU. Carboplatin and paclitaxel is commonly used in squamous cancer of the lung but its efficacy in SCC of the anal cancer is unclear. The objective of this study is to determine the tolerability and outcome of patients with SCC of the anal canal treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel at Moffitt Cancer Center. Method(s): Retrospective analysis was conducted looking at Moffitt Cancer tumor registry from 1/2007 to 1/2012. Eligible patients were required to have diagnosis of SCC of the anal cancer and received carboplatin/paclitaxel every 3 weeks as part of the treatment. Result(s): 13 patients fulfilled the criteria. 11 patients were initially diagnosed with early stage (Stage I-III). 11 patients received concurrent chemo radiation (Nigro regimen or cisplatin + 5-FU) and had reoccurrence. 2 patients were initially diagnosed with Stage IV disease. Median age was 56 years and 77% were females. Upon diagnosis of metastatic disease, 11 patients received prior chemotherapy (cisplatin/5FU, irinotecan/cetuximab, cisplatin/docetaxel). 4/13 patients received 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, 7/13 received only 1 prior regimen and 2/13 did not receive any prior chemotherapy. Patients received an average of 4.7 cycles (1 cycle= 3 weeks). Median was 4 cycles. The response rate was high at 62% with 2 patients achieving complete response and 6 patients with partial response. Grade 3 toxicities included peripheral neuropathy (n= 3), diarrhea (n= 1), and infection (n=3). 4 patients had grade 3 neutropenia and 1 patient had grade 4 anemia. Median progression free survival and overall survival were 4.6 and 10.5 months respectively.

1167,"Radiation retinopathy is treatable with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor bevacizumab (Avastin) PURPOSE: To report on bevacizumab treatment for radiation retinopathy affecting the macula.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with radiation retinopathy (edema, hemorrhages, capillary dropout, and neovascularization) and a subjective or objective loss of vision were treated. Treatment involved intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.05 mL) every 6-12 weeks. Treatment was discontinued at patient request or if there was no measurable response to therapy. Main outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity, ophthalmic examination, retinal photography, and angiography.RESULTS: Bevacizumab treatment was followed by reductions in retinal hemorrhage, exudation, and edema. Visual acuities were stable or improved in 86% (n=18). Three patients discontinued therapy. Each was legally blind before treatment (n=1), experienced little to no subjective improvement (n=2), or was poorly compliant (n=2). Three patients (14%) regained 2 or more lines of visual acuity. No ocular or systemic bevacizumab-related side effects were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab can be used to treat radiation retinopathy.

699,"Photobiomodulation Using a Low-Level Light-Emitting Diode Improves Cognitive Dysfunction in the 5XFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease Photobiomodulation using low-level light-emitting diode can be rapidly applied in neurological and physiological disorders safely and noninvasively. Photobiomodulation is effective for chronic diseases because of fewer side effects than drugs. Here we investigated the effects of photobiomodulation using light-emitting diode on amyloid plaques, gliosis, and neuronal loss to prevent and/or recover cognitive impairment, and optimal timing of photobiomodulation initiation for recovering cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. 5XFAD mice were used as an Alzheimer's disease model. Animals receiving photobiomodulation treatment were divided into two groups: an early group starting photobiomodulation at 2 months of age (5XFAD+Early), and a late group starting photobiomodulation at 6 months of age (5XFAD+Delay). Both groups received photobiomodulation 20 minutes per session three times per week for 14 weeks. The Morris water maze, passive avoidance, and elevated plus maze tests were performed at 10 months of age. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed after behavioral evaluation. The results showed that photobiomodulation treatment at early stages reduced amyloid accumulation, neuronal loss, and microgliosis and alleviated the cognitive dysfunction in 5XFAD mice, possibly by increasing insulin degrading enzyme related to amyloid-beta degradation. Photobiomodulation may be an excellent candidate for advanced preclinical Alzheimer's disease research.",Excluded
165,"Does the Gamma Knife dose rate affect outcomes in radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia? OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the radiation dose rate affects clinical outcomes in patients who undergo stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) to manage typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN).METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied pain relief in 165 patients with medically intractable TN, who underwent 80-Gy GKS using a single 4-mm collimator between 1994 and 2005. No patient had received prior radiation treatment. The measured relative helmet output factor of the Gamma Knife was 0.8 throughout this interval, and the dose rate varied from 1.21 Gy/minute to 3.74 Gy/minute (median 2.06 Gy/minute). Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months.RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479).CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute. Cobalt 60 source decay did not affect outcomes of GKS for TN pain management, even for dose rates approximating a 2-half-life decay of the isotope.",Excluded
923,"Ionizing radiation induces endothelial transdifferentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells through the Tie2 signaling pathway Glioblastomas (GBM) are brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite treatment that combines surgical resection and radio-chemotherapy. These tumors are characterized by abundant vascularization and significant cellular heterogeneity including GBM stem-like cells (GSC) which contribute to tumor aggressiveness, resistance, and recurrence. Recent data has demonstrated that GSC are directly involved in the formation of new vessels via their transdifferentiation into Tumor Derived Endothelial Cells (TDEC). We postulate that cellular stress such as ionizing radiation (IR) could enhance the transdifferentiation of GSC into TDEC. GSC neurospheres isolated from 3 different patients were irradiated or not and were then transdifferentiated into TDEC. In fact, TDEC obtained from irradiated GSC (TDEC IR+) migrate more towards VEGF, form more pseudotubes in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> in vitro and develop more functional blood vessels in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> plugs implanted in Nude mice than TDEC obtained from non-irradiated GSC. Transcriptomic analysis allows us to highlight an overexpression of Tie2 in TDEC IR+. All IR-induced effects on TDEC were abolished by using a Tie2 kinase inhibitor, which confirms the role of the Tie2 signaling pathway in this process. Finally, by analyzing Tie2 expression in patient GBMs by immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the number of Tie2+ vessels increases in recurrent GBM compared with matched untreated tumors. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IR potentiates proangiogenic features of TDEC through the Tie2 signaling pathway, which indicates a new pathway of treatment-induced tumor adaptation. New therapeutic strategies that associate standard treatment and a Tie2 signaling pathway inhibitor should be considered for future trials.",Excluded
209,"Effect of tumour depth on thermal neutron distribution in brain tissue Neutron capture therapy in the treatment of brain tumors is a procedure consisting of localization within the tumor of a suitable nuclide having high thermal neutron cross section. When the tumor is irradiated by thermal neutrons which selectively interact with the localized nuclide, the ionizing radiation resulting from the reaction dissipates its energy within the tumor and destroys it, leaving normal tissue relatively unharmed. Ten minutes post injection of Boron 10 differential concentration between tumor and normal brain tissue was obtained as reported by Farr (1951). The differential concentration was found to be 3.3:1. In the present work a simulated tumor contained <sup>10</sup>B in a concentration of 50 mug/g tissue and the brain tissue bulk that fills up the skull in a concentration of 15 mug/g tissue. The dose imparted to the tumors was nearly 2.6 times that imparted to the ordinary brain tissue. The tumor was located first between 1-3.5 cm from the skull surface; secondly, it was located between 3.6-6 cm from skull surface. In each case it was observed that there was a sharp fall of neutron flux where the tumor was fixed. Such a sharp fall of neutron flux is anticipated due to the high boron content in the tumor.

Temozolomide was administered at 150 mg/ m2 and oral TRC-102 at 150 mg daily, days 1-5 every 4 weeks. Primary objective was efficacy measured by objective radiographic response rate (RR= CR+PR). Secondary objectives included safety and PFS-6. Exploratory objectives were to assess treatment efficacy with tumor expression of N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), a BER protein, and MGMT status with RR, PFS, and OS. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that combination therapy would achieve a RR of 30%. RESULT(S): Nineteen patients were enrolled in the first stage. Median age was 60 years (range: 48-76), 53% females, median KPS was 80 (range: 70-90). Median cycles of treatment was 2 (range: 1-12). No responses were observed.

162,"Phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin alters chaperone function through loss of dimeric substructure Phosphorylation is the most common posttranslational modification of the alpha-crystallins in the human lens. These phosphorylated forms are not only important because of their abundance in aging lenses and the implications for cataract but also because they have been identified in patients with degenerative brain disease. By using mimics corresponding to the reported in vivo phosphorylation sites in the human lens, we have examined the effects of phosphorylation upon the chaperone-like properties and structure of alphaB-crystallin. Here we show that phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin at Ser-45 results in uncontrolled aggregation. By using an innovative tandem mass spectrometry approach, we demonstrate how this alteration in behavior stems from disruption of dimeric substructure within the polydisperse alphaB-crystallin assembly. This structural perturbation appears to disturb the housekeeping role of alphaB-crystallin and consequently has important implications for the disease states caused by protein aggregation in the lens and deposition in non-lenticular tissue.",Excluded

294,"Primary central nervous system lymphomas PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B cell lymphoma that occurs in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. Primary ocular lymphoma represents an important variant of this disease. The outcome for patients with PCNSL is rapidly improving with new treatment strategies. This review focuses on recent advances, investigations, and controversies in the management of these increasingly important malignancies.RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of PCNSL is rising in immunocompetent patients over the age of 60 years for unexplained reasons. However, the incidence of AIDS-related PCNSL, which is related to Epstein-Barr virus infections, has fallen with the institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy. During the past decade, standard therapy has evolved from cranial irradiation to high dose methotrexate-based regimens. This shift in therapy has been associated with an increase in the median survival of patients from 1 year to longer than 3 years, and with an equally striking reduction in neurotoxicity if whole brain radiation is avoided. Optimal therapeutic results require careful attention to opportunistic infections, thromboembolic disease, and renal toxicities associated with high dose methotrexate.SUMMARY: Overall, PCNSLs are increasing in frequency and the results of therapy for this disease have dramatically improved during the past decade. Many important therapeutic questions remain unanswered. These include the optimal dose, frequency, and duration of methotrexate, as well as the roles of additional systemic chemotherapy drugs, intrathecal therapy, and cranial irradiation. Further progress in this uncommon disease will depend on entering patients into carefully designed multicenter clinical trials to build upon the significant advances that have been made.

431,"Impact of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer: Single center experience Purpose/Objective: to report the clinical outcome and toxicity of patients affected by nasopharyngeal cancer treated with different radiotherapy (RT) techniques, namely 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Material(s) and Method(s): between January 2000 and December 2013, 82 patients underwent concomitant chemo-radiation with curative intent. By January 2007, IMRT was clinically available at our department and became preferentially adopted in place of 3DCRT. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from first day of treatment to progressive disease or death from any cause; overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from first day of treatment to death from any cause. Acute and late toxicities were retrospectively evaluated according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0) and LENT SOMA scale, respectively. Result(s): Fifty-one patients (62.2%) were treated with 3DCRT while 31 with IMRT (37.8%). The median age of patients was 52.4 years. The majority of patients (54; 65.8%) were diagnosed with loco-regional advanced disease: 35 (42.6%) were in stage IVA/IVB disease and 19 (23.1%) in stage III, respectively. Sixty-four patients (78%) were treated with a conventionally-fractionated, 7 weeks RT regimen delivered in a sequential approach: 50 Gy were delivered to sites deemed at low risk of microscopic infiltration, 60 Gy to macroscopic uninvolved sites but deemed at high risk of disease presence or relapse, 70 Gy to tumor and involved nodal clinical target volumes (CTV's). In 18 patients (22%) the IMRT technique allowed the simultaneous delivery of different doses per fraction, namely 1.8 Gy, 2 Gy and 2.2 Gy aimed at the same volumes described above within a shorter overall treatment time (30 fractions delivered in 6 weeks). The majority of patients (62; 75.6%) received cisplatin-based, concomitant chemotherapy: a 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> three-weekly schedule was administered to 34 of them (56%) while the rest (28; 44%) received a 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly schedule. Twenty patients (24.3%) of the whole cohort diagnosed with very advanced tumors infiltrating neurological structures were given induction chemotherapy (cisplatin-5 fluorouracil or cisplatin- 5 fluoruracil-docetaxel regimens) before concomitant chemoradiation. Twenty patients (24.3%), mostly affected by stage I and II N0 disease, or unfit to receive chemotherapy, were treated with radiotherapy alone. In terms of clinical outcome, the 30-month PFS was 69.6%; progressive disease was diagnosed in 25 patients (30.4%), among them 18 treated with 3DCRT and 7 with IMRT. The first site of failure was distant in 12 (48%) cases and loco-regional in 13 (52%). In terms of OS, at a median follow-up of 51 months, 47 patients (57.3%) were alive. Regarding acute toxicity, the most frequent adverse event was severe (G3-G4) mucositis which was diagnosed in 17 patients in the 3DCRT group (33.3%) and in 8 in the IMRT group (25.8%). The 12-month xerostomia of moderate-severe intensity (G2-G3) was also more frequently found in the 3DCRT cohort than in the IMRT one (31.3% and 10% of patients, respectively).

Using dual whole-cell recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons, we injected long-duration white-noise current into the dendrites. The amplitude variance of this stimulus was adjusted to produce either low subthreshold or high suprathreshold fluctuations of the somatic membrane potential. Somatic action potentials were produced in the high variance input condition. Applying a rigorous system-identification approach, we discovered that the neuronal input/output function was extremely well described by a model containing a linear bandpass filter followed by a nonlinear static-gain. Using computer models, we found that a range of voltage-dependent channel properties can readily account for the experimentally observed filtering in the neuronal input/output function. In addition, the bandpass signal processing of the neuronal input/output function was determined by the time-dependence of the channels. A simple active channel, however, could not account for the experimentally observed change in gain. These results suggest that nonlinear voltage- and time-dependent channels contribute to the linear filtering of the neuronal input/output function and that channel kinetics shape temporal signal processing in dendrites.

675,"Single-neuron perturbations reveal feature-specific competition in V1 The computations performed by local neural populations, such as a cortical layer, are typically inferred from anatomical connectivity and observations of neural activity. Here we describe a method-influence mapping-that uses single-neuron perturbations to directly measure how cortical neurons reshape sensory representations. In layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1), we use two-photon optogenetics to trigger action potentials in a targeted neuron and calcium imaging to measure the effect on spiking in neighbouring neurons in awake mice viewing visual stimuli. Excitatory neurons on average suppressed other neurons and had a centre-surround influence profile over anatomical space. A neuron's influence on its neighbour depended on their similarity in activity. Notably, neurons suppressed activity in similarly tuned neurons more than in dissimilarly tuned neurons. In addition, photostimulation reduced the population response, specifically to the targeted neuron's preferred stimulus, by around 2%. Therefore, V1 layer 2/3 performed feature competition, in which a like-suppresses-like motif reduces redundancy in population activity and may assist with inference of the features that underlie sensory input. We anticipate that influence mapping can be extended to investigate computations in other neural populations.",Excluded
916,"Ionizing radiation induces structural and functional damage on the molecules of rat brain homogenate membranes: a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic study Humans can be exposed to ionizing radiation, due to various reasons, whose structural effects on biological membranes are not well defined. The current study aims to understand the ionizing radiation-induced structural and functional alterations in biomolecules of brain membranes using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy using rat animal models. For this purpose, 1000 cGy of ionizing radiation was specifically directed to the head of Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were decapitated after 24 h. The results revealed that the lipid-to-protein ratio decreased and that irradiation caused lipid peroxidation and increases in the amounts of olefinic =CH, carbonyl, and methylene groups of lipids. In addition, ionizing radiation induced a decrease in membrane fluidity, disordering of membrane lipids, strengthening of the hydrogen bonding of the phosphate groups of lipid head-groups, and weakening in the hydrogen bonding of the interfacial carbonyl groups of lipids. Radiation further caused significant decrements in the alpha-helix and turns, and significant increments in the beta-sheet and random coil contents in the protein structure. Hierarchical cluster analyses, performed in the whole region (3030-1000 cm(-1)), lipid (3030-2800 cm(-1)), and protein (1700-1600 cm(-1)) regions separately, successfully differentiated the control and irradiated groups of rat brain membranes and showed that proteins in the membranes are affected more than lipids from the damages induced with ionizing radiation. As a result, the current study showed that FT-IR spectroscopy can be used successfully as a novel method to monitor radiation-induced alterations on biological membranes.",Included

It is a slow-progressing chronic indolent disease characterized by atypical T-cells with a cerebral nucleus. Management of this disease depends on the stage and is based essentially on the systemic treatment. Radiotherapy intervenes in case of localized or extended tumor, indeed, the radiosensibility of this tumor, like any other hematological affection, makes it possible to obtain a high rate of response. Clinical case: we report the observation of a 46-year-old patient followed since 2012 for mycosis fungoid revealed by a papullo-squamous lesion located at the level of the right lumbar fossa. The diagnosis was confirmed by cutaneous biopsy, showing the presence of T lymphocytes expressing CD2, CD3, CD4, CCR4, CD45RO markers. Initial assessment included a thoraco-abdominal pelvic CT, which was normal, an accelerated sedimentation rate at the 1<sup>st</sup> hour, a high C reactive protein (CRP), the electrolytic, renal, hepatic status and the hemogram were normal. Patient received 6 courses of chemotherapy according to the COPP protocol with a decrease in the size of the lesion estimated at 40%. A norm fractionated radiation therapy was delivered at the dose of 36Gy. The evolution was marked by a complete remission, maintained after 6 months of the treatment. Mycosis fungoid is a rare disease, whose management must be discussed in a multidisciplinary team. Radiotherapy remains an interesting option for all stages, but has to be val idated in largest studies. Copyright © Madiha Chellakhi et al.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 20 patents were retrospectvely selected. Both IMRT and VMAT plans were generated for each patent. Reference dose distributons for gamma analysis were calculated with RDCGS of 1-5 mm at intervals of 1 mm. Dose distributons were measured using MapCHECK2 and ArcCHECK dosimeters. Both global and local gamma analyses with gamma criteria of 3%/3 mm, 2%/3 mm, 2%/2 mm, and 2%/1 mm were performed with various RDCGS. Result(s): As the RDCGS increased from 1 mm to 5 mm, the average global GPRs with 2%/2 mm for VMAT with MapCHECK2 and ArcCHECK decreased by 9.3% and 5.9%, respectvely. The average local GPRs decreased by 14% and 11.7%, respectvely. For IMRT, the global GPRs decreased by 4.8% and 6%, respectvely, whereas the local GPRs decreased by 10.5% and 8.6%, respectvely. The effect of the RDCGS on the GPRs became larger when performing local gamma analysis as well as when applying small distance-to-agreement (DTA). As the RDCGS increased, the average changes in the GPR per mm of DTA change increased regardless of the type of radiotherapy, detector, or gamma analysis. Conclusion(s): For an accurate verificaton of the IMRT and VMAT plans, it is recommended that the reference dose distributon must be calculated with the smallest possible RDCGS.

735,"Hypo-fractionated IMRT for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: a 6 year single institutional experience OBJECTIVES: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults. Surgery and radiotherapy constitute the cornerstones for the therapeutic management of GBM. The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol. Despite the progress in neurosurgery, radiotherapy and oncology, the prognosis still results poor. In order to reduce the long time of standard treatment, maintaining or improving the clinical results, in our institute we have investigated the effects of hypo-fractionated radiation therapy for patients with GBM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients affected by GBM who had previously undergone surgical resection (total, subtotal or biopsy) were enrolled between October 2005 and December 2011 in a single institutional study of hypo-fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) followed or not by adjuvant chemotherapy with TMZ (6-12 cycles). The most important eligibility criteria were: biopsy-proven GBM, KPS >= 60, age >= 18 years, no previous brain irradiation, informed consensus. Hypo-fractionated IMRT was delivered to a total dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions prescribed to 70% isodose. Response to treatment, OS, PFS, toxicity and patterns of recurrence were evaluated, and sex, age, type of surgery, Karnofsky performance status, Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification, time between surgery and initiation of radiotherapy were evaluated as potential prognostic factors for survival.RESULTS: All patients have completed the treatment protocol. Median age was 64.5 years (range 41-82 years) with 31 females (46%) and 36 males (54%). Median KPS at time of treatment was 80. The surgery was gross total in 38 patients and subtotal in 14 patients; 15 patients underwent only biopsy. No grade 3-4 acute or late neurotoxicity was observed. With median follow-up of 14.9 months, the median OS and PFS were 13.4 and 7.9 months, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The hypo-fractionated radiation therapy can be used for patients with GBM, resulting in favourable overall survival, low rates of toxicity and satisfying QoL. Future investigations are needed to determine the optimal fractionation for GBM.",Excluded

A phase 2 trial of single-agent NKTR-102 compared a dose of 145 mg/m2 every 2w or every 3w in 3rd-line MBC (Awada et al, ASCO 2011). Overall the ORR was 29% (including 3% CR) with the prior ATC subset demonstrating an ORR of 31%. Dosing every 3w was better tolerated; in this arm, median PFS equaled 5.3m and median OS equaled 13.1m. Trial Design: NKTR-102 will be compared to TPC in an open-label, randomized, parallel, two arm multicenter Phase 3 pivotal study in pts with previously treated locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Key Entry Criteria: Adult females, with ECOG 0 or 1 with adequate liver, kidney and marrow function. All patients must have received prior therapy with an anthracycline (in neo/adjuvant or metastatic setting or both), a taxane (in neo/adjuvant or metastatic setting or both) and capecitabine (in neo/adjuvant or locally advanced/metastatic setting or both) unless not medically appropriate or explicitly contraindicated for the patient. All chemotherapy- and radiation-related toxicities must have resolved to Grade 1, except for stable sensory neuropathy Grade 2 and alopecia. Pts with brain metastases may be eligible, if stable for prior 4 weeks without steroids. Pts with Grade 2 pre-existing diarrhea or receiving chronic anti-diarrheal supportive care are not eligible. Statistical Methods: The primary efficacy endpoint is OS. Secondary endpoints include ORR by RECIST v1.1 and PFS. Pts will be randomized 1:1 to NKTR-102 given IV at 145 mg/m2 over 90-min every 21 days or TPC. Patients randomized to TPC will receive single agent chemotherapy, limited to choice of one of the following 5 agents: eribulin, ixabepilone, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, or a taxane. The investigator must decide which agent will be given to the patient prior to randomization. Pts will be stratified by geographical region and disease characteristics. Target Accrual: Approximately 840 patients (420 pts per treatment arm) will be randomized in order to obtain 615 deaths (alpha = 0.05; power 90% with one interim analysis scheduled when 50% of the deaths have occurred).

437,"Hifu generated fast hyperthermia as a new option for glioblastoma treatment Introduction: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, corresponding to grade IV of the World Health Organization histological classification (Louis et al., 2007). High grade gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, with an incidence of 3.1 per 100,000 person-year in the USA and the median survival times of 14.6 months (Stupp et al., 2005) after first occurrence and 11.9 after the first re-resection (Quick et al., 2014). Against to this pathology, we proposed (Borasi et al., 2014) the use of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Material(s) and Method(s): The first brain tumor ablation treatments with the magnetic resonance (MR) guided HIFU (Exablate Neuro), recently described (Coluccia et al., 2014), revealed the power limitation of the system in penetrating the skull bone so that only a small tumor volume could be ablated. We then concentrate ourselves on the use of this HIFU device for administering, on a larger possible volume, a low power ""fast hyperthermia"", coupled with a standard EBRT protocol. We simulated the combined effect of radiotherapy (EBRT) and fast hyperthermia (FH) in the mathematical frame of Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. A new formulation of the synergistic effect has been developed. Result(s): The EBRT plus FH should be able to overcome the main problem of GBM treatments, that is, the progressive modification to a more aggressive and resistant entity, due to a subset of glioma cells that share many characteristics with stem cells (Galli et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2004). These cells are generally resistant to RX and TMZ and are considered a cause of recurrence (Bao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2012). Conclusion(s): The assumption that hyperthermia can sensitize glioma stemlike cells to radiation has been recently verified by Man et al. (2015). The EBRT plus (HIFU generated) FH treatments deserve, in our opinion, a large scale trial to give a new therapeutic perspective to this devastating pathology.",Excluded

774,"Chemical basis of reactive oxygen species reactivity and involvement in neurodegenerative diseases Increasing numbers of individuals suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by progressive loss of neurons. Oxidative stress, in particular, the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), play an important role in the development of these diseases, as evidenced by the detection of products of lipid, protein and DNA oxidation in vivo. Even if they participate in cell signaling and metabolism regulation, ROS are also formidable weapons against most of the biological materials because of their intrinsic nature. By nature too, neurons are particularly sensitive to oxidation because of their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, weak antioxidant defense and high oxygen consumption. Thus, the overproduction of ROS in neurons appears as particularly deleterious and the mechanisms involved in oxidative degradation of biomolecules are numerous and complexes. This review highlights the production and regulation of ROS, their chemical properties, both from kinetic and thermodynamic points of view, the links between them, and their implication in neurodegenerative diseases.

559,"Differential biodistribution of native and 2 kGy 60Co irradiated crotoxin in tissues of CBA/J mice Crotalus durissus envenomation is treated using antivenins produced in horses. During production, animals have problems, sometimes followed by death, due to the high toxicity of the main toxin, crotoxin. Several methods tested to detoxify this toxin often resulted in decreased immunogenicity. Gamma irradiation has proved to be a successful method for crotoxin detoxification without loss of immunogenicity. We have studied the biodistribution of 2 kGy 60Co irradiated crotoxin (iCTX) in mouse tissues. We used both 125I-labeled iCTX or its detection by a specific immunohistochemistry assay (IHA). Both approaches showed similar early excretion of toxins by the kidneys. Higher iCTX uptake was seen in spleen and liver, which are rich in immune responder cells. In contrast to previous reports concerning native crotoxin (nCTX), we failed to detect iCTX in the neuromuscular junction, but both toxins were found on the kidney tubular cell surface, with rapid excretion that was more intense for iCTX. Kupffer cells and splenocyte macrophages presented IHA staining, as shown by the increased uptake of 125I toxin by these organs. No staining was observed in the brain, lung or heart, which also showed very low 125I counts. Allied to reduced toxicity, irradiation induced early endocytosis of crotoxin by phagocytic cells, improving antigen processing.",Excluded
262,"Radioprotective effects of the association thymopentin-interleukin-1 alpha in the C57BL/6 mouse We investigated whether thymopentin, a synthetic pentapeptide derivative of thymopoietin, could enhance the protective effect of interleukin-1 alpha when both administered prior to sublethal irradiation in the C57BL/6 mouse. Thymopentin (10 mg/kg/day/7 days) was injected intraperitoneally in groups of C57BL/6 mice. Then, interleukin-1 alpha was administered on day 7. Twenty hr later, all groups were given whole body sublethal irradiation of 750 rad by 60Co elements. In some groups of mice, treatment with thymopentin was continued for 1 week after irradiation. Efficacy of the combination treatment was assessed by evaluation of mortality, as well as by histologic examination of the brain, testis, bone marrow, heart and spleen. The combination of relatively low doses of interleukin-1 alpha (700 U) with thymopentin yielded a survival which was nearly that observed with interleukin-1 alpha (1000 U) given alone (about 100%). The optimal effect was observed in animals treated for 15 days with thymopentin, either in combination or alone. In addition, incidence and severity of histological lesions were also lower in animals with the some treatment schedule. Our results suggest that the combined treatment thymopentin-interleukin-1 alpha prevents radiation damage in the mouse.",Included
1321,"Relationship between dose and the latent period for radiation myelopathy in rats A 1-cm segment of rat cervical spinal cord was irradiated (16-150 Gy) and the animals were followed for 16 months to determine the dose-response relationship for the latent period for radiation myelopathy. The latent period was found to be dependent on dose in the ED0 to ED100 dose range, independent of dose in the range ED100 to 1.5 times the ED100 dose and dependent on dose for doses more than 1.5 times the ED100 dose. Histologically, some vascular injury and demyelinization were observed in the irradiated cord segment of all paretic animals. In the first dose-dependent region there was a bimodal distribution of latent periods, suggesting two mechanisms for paralysis in this dose region. A hypothesis based on glial and vascular injury is presented which explains the triphasic dose-response relationship for the latent period. The 95% confidence limits for the dose location of both of the dose-dependent regions were less than 10% of the administered dose. Therefore, if used correctly, the latent period as an end point should be able to be used to detect dose-modifying parameters (i.e. RBE and OER) that are greater than 20%.",Included

371,"More movement with evaluating colonic transit in humans BACKGROUND: Colonic functions (ie, absorption of fluids and electrolytes, digestion of selected nutrients, harbor for microbes, and elimination of excreta) necessitate complex patterns of storage and transit. Indeed, colonic transit accounts for a major part of the mouth-to-anus transit time. Colonic transit assessments are useful for understanding the pathophysiology of disease, the pharmacodynamic effects of new medications and to diagnose slow transit constipation. Currently, radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, and a colonic pH-pressure capsule are used to measure overall colonic transit. Radioopaque markers, scintigraphy, and the electromagnetic capsule, which is a newer technique, also evaluate regional colonic transit. The pH-pressure capsule also measures colonic pressures. Magnetic resonance imaging and a radio-frequency identification-based device are evolving methods for assessing colonic transit.PURPOSE: This mini-review, which accompanies a study evaluating the assessment of colon transit with the electromagnetic capsule, evaluates and compares existing and evolving methods for evaluating colonic transit in humans (Neurogastroenterol Motil. 2018; in press). In addition to overall and regional colonic transit, the electromagnetic capsule evaluates colonic motor patterns without radiation exposure. These patterns are summarized by analyzing the characteristics (ie, distance and velocity) of discrete antegrade and retrograde capsule movements as they travel in the colon. However, the electromagnetic capsule does not measure pressure or colonic wall movement (ie, contractions). The motor patterns identified by this capsule should be compared with motor patterns identified with manometry. The next challenge is to harness different techniques to evaluate the relationships between colonic pressures and transit or, even better, the trifecta of colonic contractions, pressure events, and transit.",Excluded

This may be used to quantify the high-affinity state of 5-HT2A receptors and may have the potential to quantify changes in cerebral 5-HT levels in vivo. We here investigated safety aspects related to clinical use of [11C]Cimbi-36, including radiation dosimetry and in vivo pharmacology.PROCEDURES: [11C]Cimbi-36 was injected in rats or pigs, and radiation dosimetry was examined by ex vivo dissection or with PET scanning, respectively. Based on animal data, the Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment software was used to estimate extrapolated human dosimetry for [11C]Cimbi-36. The 5-HT2A receptor agonist actions of [11C]Cimbi-36 in vivo pharmacological effects in mice elicited by increasing doses of Cimbi-36 were assessed with the head-twitch response (HTR).RESULTS: The effective dose as extrapolated from both rat and pig data was low, 7.67 and 4.88 muSv/MBq, respectively. In addition, the estimated absorbed radiation dose to human target organs did not exceed safety levels. Administration of 0.5 mg/kg Cimbi-36 leads to significant HTR compared to saline, whereas 0.05 mg/kg Cimbi-36 (doses much larger than those given in conjunction with a PET scan) did not elicit a significant HTR.CONCLUSIONS: Administration of tracer doses of [11C]Cimbi-36 does not seem to be associated with unusual radiation burden or adverse clinical effects.",Excluded

The established relationship between glioma risk and exposure to ionizing radiation led us to examine whether variants in the DNA repair genes contribute to disease susceptibility. We evaluated 1127 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) supplemented with 388 putative functional SNPs to capture most of the common variation in 136 DNA repair genes, in five unique case-control series from four different countries (1013 cases, 1016 controls).

This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of intracoronary radiation therapy (ICRT) after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for preventing restenosis in human coronary arteries.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22 arteries) with unstable angina underwent standard balloon angioplasty. ICRT was performed with the use of an 192Ir source wire that was hand delivered to the angioplasty site. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 24 hours, between 30 and 60 days, and at 6 months. Angioplasty was successful in 19 of 22 lesions, and insertion of the radioactive source wire was successful at all treated sites. Angiographic study at 24 hours demonstrated early late loss of the luminal diameter from 1.92+/-0.55 to 1.40+/-0.27 mm. Between 30 and 60 days, repeat angiography demonstrated total occlusion in 2 arteries, a new pseudoaneurysm in 1 artery, and significant dilatation at the treatment site in 2 additional vessels. At > or = 6 months' follow-up, all remaining arteries (n=20) maintained patent, with a mean lumen diameter of 1.65+/-0.8 mm. The calculated late lumen loss was 0.27+/-0.56 mm, and the late loss index was 0.19. Clinical events at 1 year included myocardial infarction in 1 patient, repeat angioplasty to the treated site in 3 patients, and persistent angina in 7 patients.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate that ICRT after coronary intervention is feasible and is associated with an acceptable degree of complications and lower rates of angiographic restenosis indexes.",Excluded

Patients with female gender, advanced stage, completion of treatments within 1 year, higher levels of depression, more severe trismus and higher symptom severity tended to have malnutrition or were at risk of malnutrition. Trismus and xerostomia are long-term problems in some NPC survivors and may contribute to malnutrition.

To improve disease control and postpone cranial radiotherapy, we designed a phase II study of intensive procarbazine, lomunstine and vincristine followed by high-dose thiotepa with autologous stem cell rescue for patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic or aggressive oligodendroglioma. Patients and Methods: Sixty-nine patients with a median age of 42 (range: 18-67) and a median Karnofsky Performance Score of 90 (range: 70-100) were enrolled. Sixteen patients had a prior diagnosis of low-grade oligodendroglioma and 16 had mixed oligoastrocytoma pathology. Only patients with demonstrably chemosensitive enhancing tumors or those free of enhancing tumor after surgery and induction therapy were eligible to receive high-dose thiotepa. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients (57%) completed the transplant regimen; their estimated median progression-free survival is 69 months and median overall survival has not been reached. Twelve transplanted patients (31 %) relapsed. Neither histology nor prior low-grade oligodendroglioma correlated with relapse; however, persistent non-enhancing tumor at transplant conferred an increased risk of relapse (p = 0.028). The transplant regimen was well-tolerated; median hospital stay was 20 days (range: 7-43) with a median time to ANC and platelet engraftment of 10 days. Thirty patients (43%) did not receive high-dose thiotepa because of stable or progressive disease (n = 21), excessive toxicity (n = 4), refusal of further therapy (n = 2), failure to obtain insurance coverage (n = 2), or other (n - 1).

Patients demographic data, co-morbidities, diagnosis, surgical approach, length of surgery, MAP, and blood loss during surgery were recorded. All patients' visual acuity and field deficits were evaluated by neuro-ophthalmologist prior to their surgery and within 30 days after their surgery. Surgical anesthesia was maintained by TIVA (Propofol/remifentanil infusion). Changes in anesthetic agents and intraoperative events (e.g., sudden blood loss, use of vasopressors .etc) were timed and recorded. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. We found that FVEP is reproducible throughout surgery and can predict the postsurgical outcome. Additionally, we found that FVEP is transiently affected by different stages of surgery (e.g., traction on optic chiasm, dissection, etc.). Also we found boluses of propofol and electrocautery can artificially affect FVEP.",Excluded
1112,"Combined Transradial and Transfemoral Approach With Ostial Vertebral Balloon Protection for the Treatment of Patients With Subclavian Steal Syndrome Background: Patients with an obstructive subclavian artery (SA) may exhibit symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency known as subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). Endovascular treatment with stent assisted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (SAPTA) demonstrates significantly lower percentage of intraoperative and postoperative complications in comparison with open surgery. There is a 1-5% risk of distal intracranial embolization through the ipsilateral vertebral artery (VA) during SAPTA. Objective(s): To assess the safety and feasibility of a novel technique for distal embolic protection using balloon catheters during SA revascularization with a dual transfemoral and transradial access. Method(s): We describe a case series of patients with SSS who underwent SAPTA due to severe stenosis or occlusion of the SA using a combined anterograde/retrograde approach. Transfemoral access to SA was obtained using large bore guide sheaths. Ipsilateral transradial access was obtained using intermediate bore catheters. A Scepter XC balloon catheter was introduced through the transradial intermediate catheter into the ipsilateral VA at the ostium during SAPTA for distal embolic protection. Result(s): A total of eight patients with SSS underwent subclavian SAPTA. Four patients had the combined anterograde/retrograde approach. Successful revascularization was achieved in three of them. It was difficult to create a channel in the fourth unsuccessful case due to heavily calcified plaque burden. No peri-operative ischemic events were identified. On follow-up, we demonstrated patency of the stents with resolution of symptoms and without any adverse events. Conclusion(s): Subclavian stenting using a combined transradial and transfemoral access with compliant balloon catheters at the vertebral ostium for prevention of distal emboli may represent an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of SA stenosis and occlusions. © Copyright © 2020 Fakih, Dandapat, Mendez-Ruiz, Mendez, Farooqui, Zevallos, Quispe Orozco, Hasan, Rossen, Samaniego, Derdeyn and Ortega-Gutierrez.",Excluded
378,"ATM kinase inhibition preferentially sensitizes p53-mutant glioma to ionizing radiation PURPOSE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain cancer with a median survival of only 12 to 15 months. Current standard treatment consists of surgery followed by chemoradiation. The poor survival of patients with GBM is due to aggressive tumor invasiveness, an inability to remove all tumor tissue, and an innate tumor chemo- and radioresistance. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is an excellent target for radiosensitizing GBM because of its critical role in regulating the DNA damage response and p53, among other cellular processes. As a first step toward this goal, we recently showed that the novel ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019 reduced migration, invasion, and growth, and potently radiosensitized human glioma cells in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using orthotopic xenograft models of GBM, we now show that KU-60019 is also an effective radiosensitizer in vivo. Human glioma cells expressing reporter genes for monitoring tumor growth and dispersal were grown intracranially, and KU-60019 was administered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery or osmotic pump.RESULTS: Our results show that the combined effect of KU-60019 and radiation significantly increased survival of mice 2- to 3-fold over controls. Importantly, we show that glioma with mutant p53 is much more sensitive to KU-60019 radiosensitization than genetically matched wild-type glioma.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that an ATM kinase inhibitor may be an effective radiosensitizer and adjuvant therapy for patients with mutant p53 brain cancers.",Excluded
124,"The neurophysiology of vomiting Nausea and vomiting can be induced by a wide variety of stimuli such as pregnancy, space travel, raised intracranial pressure, radiation and cytotoxic drugs. The mechanisms by which all these diverse stimuli culminate in a final common act is unknown. From studies in the 1950s a model of the emetic reflex emerged consisting of a chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema and a vomiting centre in the brain stem. This concept has been reviewed and revised in the light of recent studies. Many discussions of emesis involve detailed descriptions of the gastrointestinal events associated with the act of vomiting only - nausea and retching receiving little attention. Here we have tried to give a broader view by considering the neurophysiology of such events and have included nausea and retching, phenomena that are usually inseparable from vomiting. The possible biological function of these events is also discussed. The involvement of visceral systems (such as the heart, airways and gut) is included, and particular attention is paid to vagal mechanisms underlying the changes in gut motor activity. Emesis has long been thought to be organized by a 'vomiting centre'; the possibility that this vomiting centre could be the parvcellular reticular formation is reviewed, as is the concept that the 'centre' is larger than an anatomically defined single group of cells. The mechanism of action of two clinically relevant emetic stimuli - radiation and cytotoxic drugs - is considered in detail. Recent studies of the antiemetic properties of novel 5-HT-3 receptor antagonists against radiation and cytotoxic drug-induced vomiting are discussed; these studies suggest that important advances will be made in the treatment of emesis induced by these and other related agents.",Excluded
350,"Characterization of the inflammatory response to solid cancer metastases in the human brain BACKGROUND: New immunomodulatroy agents, like ipilimumab, showed promising activity in brain metastases (BM). However, little is known about the inflammatory response in BM and new insights are needed to further guide the development of treatment strategies. METHOD(S): We investigated 17 human autoptic tissue specimens of BM from breast cancer (n = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 5), small cell lung cancer (SCLC; n = 3) and melanoma (n = 6). Immunohistochemical staining for a comprehensive panel of 21 inflammation-associated markers was performed. Results were quantified by manual counting of the various cell populations in three areas of 0.5 mm2 (intratumoral, peritumoral, control region). RESULT(S): Profound microglia activation with marked peritumoral accumulation and some intratumoral infiltration of HLA-DR-positive microglia/macrophages was found. A high proportion of these cells showed strong immunoreactivity for phagocytosis associated markers and MHC class 1, while a smaller subgroup of cells expressed molecules involved in radical production (inducible nitric oxide synthase or NADPH oxidases). Only few B- and T-lymphocytes were observed in and around BM. The number of CD8-positive T-cells was not correlated to MHC class 1 expression on microglia/macrophages or tumor cells. Melanoma BM had significantly less dense peritumoral microglia infiltrates than NSCLC BM. The inflammatory pattern was independent from treatment of patients with glucocorticoids or radiation. CONCLUSION(S): Inflammatory reaction to BM is mainly characterized by activation of microglia/macrophages and shows pronounced upregulation of markers involved in phagocytosis, but seems to be insufficient in activating T-cell response. Treatment strategies aimed at activating specific immunity may potentiate immune attack on tumor cells.",Excluded
554,"Study on the Appropriate Timing of Postoperative Adaptive Radiotherapy for High-Grade Glioma Purpose: To investigate the appropriate timing of adaptive radiotherapy (ART) for high-grade glioma.Methods: Ten patients with high-grade gliomas were selected and underwent CT/MRI (CT<sub>1</sub>/MRI<sub>1</sub>, CT<sub>2</sub>/MRI<sub>2</sub>, CT<sub>3</sub>/MRI<sub>3</sub>, and CT<sub>4</sub>/MRI<sub>4</sub>) scans before RT and during 10-, 20- and 30-fraction RT, and the corresponding RT plans (plan<sub>1</sub>, plan<sub>2</sub>, plan<sub>3</sub> and plan<sub>4</sub>) were made. The dose of the initial plan (plan<sub>1</sub>) was projected to CT2 and CT3 using the image registration technique to obtain the projection plans (plan<sub>1-2</sub> and plan<sub>1-3</sub>) and by superimposing the doses to obtain the ART plans (plan<sub>10+20</sub> and plan<sub>20+10</sub>), respectively. The dosimetric differences in the target volume and organs at risk (OARs) were compared between the projection and adaptive plans. The tumor control probability (TCP) for the planning target volume (PTV) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the OARs were compared between the two adaptive plans.Results: Compared with the projection plan, the D<sub>2</sub> to the PTV of ART decreased, the conformity index (CI) to the PTV increased, and the D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>mean</sub> to the brainstem, optic chiasm and pituitary, as well as the V<sub>20</sub>, V<sub>30</sub>, V<sub>40</sub> and V<sub>50</sub> to the normal brain decreased. The D<sub>2</sub> to the pituitary and optic chiasm as well as the V<sub>20</sub>, V<sub>30</sub>, V<sub>40</sub> and V<sub>50</sub> to the normal brain in plan<sub>10+20</sub> were lower than those in plan<sub>20+10</sub>, while the CI to the PTV was higher than that in plan<sub>20+10</sub>.

121,"Timing and characteristics of perceptual attenuation by transcranial stimulation: a study using magnetic cortical stimulation and somatosensory-evoked potentials Transcranial cortical magnetic stimulation (CMS) is a noninvasive, non-noxious procedure to induce perceptual attenuation when applied concomitant to sensory stimuli. To investigate the perceptual timing of simple stimulus features in the somatosensory modality, we applied right hemisphere CMS at different intervals following a stimulus delivered to the left hand. Different intervals between peripheral stimuli and CMS were defined according to the components of the somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP), previously obtained in response to the same stimulus. Perceptual attenuation was maximal when CMS coincided with the primary cortical response (parietal N20 potential); conversely, perception of stimulus intensity was not modified when CMS was concomitant with the N200 and P300 potentials. Using small CMS intensities, a ""perceptual dip"" was observed when CMS arrived in coincidence with the N120 potential, a SEP response thought to be originated in part in the second somatic area. Our results support the view that both N200 and P300 are post-perceptual responses. The results also suggest that the cortical processes active during the N20 and N120 potentials may be essential for the conscious perception of somatosensory stimuli delivered to the hand.",Excluded
1149,"What does an epileptiform spike look like in MEG? Comparison between coincident EEG and MEG spikes Recent investigations suggest that there are differences between the characteristics of EEG and MEG epileptiform spikes. The authors performed an objective characterization of the morphology of epileptiform spikes recorded simultaneously in both EEG and MEG to determine whether they present the same morphologic characteristics. Based on a stepwise approach, the authors performed a computer analysis of EEG and MEG of a set of coincident epileptiform transients selected by a senior clinical neurophysiologist in recordings of three patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A computer-based algorithm was applied to extract parameters that could be used to describe quantitatively the morphology of the transients, followed by a statistical comparison over the extracted metrics of the EEG and MEG waveforms. EEG and MEG coincident events were statistically different with respect to several morphologic characteristics, such as duration, sharpness, and shape. The differences found appear to be a consequence of MEG signals not being influenced by volume propagation through the tissues with different conductivities that surround the brain, compared with EEG, and of the different orientation of the underlying dipolar sources. The results indicate that visual inspection of MEG spikes and automatic spike-detector algorithms should use criteria adapted to the specific characteristics of the MEG, and not simply those used on conventional EEG.",Excluded

1074,"Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy enhances radiation-induced abscopal response in glioblastoma Introduction: Immunotherapy for glioblastoma have been largely unsuccessful, in part, because molecular heterogeneity drives selective elimination of only a subset of tumor cells. Therefore, therapeutic success in patients will require achieving an 'abscopal effect' where following focused radiation therapy, non-targeted tumor cells are attacked by the immune system. It remains unclear how glioblastoma respond to focused radiation in terms of failure location and whether immunotherapy could amplify the immune response to tumor outside the radiation field. Method(s): We evaluated patterns of treatment failure and outcomes in glioblastoma patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; N=47). To optimize the abscopal effect, we developed a genetically-engineered mouse model of bilateral glioblastoma. Here, one side of the mouse brain has a tumor treated by focal radiation and the contralateral untreated tumor is used as a readout of abscopal therapeutic efficacy following anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. Result(s): In glioblastoma patients receiving SRS, increasing age (>60 years) as associated with more 'out of field' treatment failure (P=0.036) and poor survival (P=0.001). In mice, we find that focal radiation of one tumor combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy induced an immunological response against tumor cells outside the radiation field and enhanced survival (P<0.05). Significant macrophage and T-cell infiltration occurred in mesenchymal subtype-like tumors (N=6-8 mice per group, P <0.01). In proneural subtype-like tumors, macrophage infiltration alone was associated with 'out of field' tumor regression (N=8 mice per group, P<0.05). In-vitro, treatment of mouse macrophages with anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced significant gene expression changes and enhanced phagocytosis in an ERK-dependent fashion. All 3 commercially available human anti-PD-L1 antibodies also induced ERK signaling with varying efficacies. Conclusion(s): Focal radiation combined with anti-PD-L1 therapy induces an immunological response to un-irradiated glioblastoma. We are currently optimizing other treatment combinations that could also be readily assessed in phase I human clinical trials.",Excluded
1193,"Neuroprotective effects of a new skin care formulation following ultraviolet exposure Background: Chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure is a major environmental factor involved in extrinsic skin ageing (photo-ageing). Skin nerve fibres are significantly reduced in number following UV irradiation and new skincare compounds with neuroprotective effects are thus highly warranted. Objective(s): We developed a new skincare formulation from a plant extract and evaluated its neuroprotective effects of ex vivo UV irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): The new skincare emulsion was formulated from Echinacea purpurea extract and was enriched with antioxidants (patent no. PROV020110087075). Skin samples were obtained from 20 healthy patients enrolled for plastic surgery and were immediately treated with placebo (SPF 15) or test emulsions. Skin samples were exposed to UVA and UVB for 60min. Nerve fibres were identified by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody, anti-human CD56. Cell damage was quantified by image analysis. Result(s): UVA and UVB significantly reduced (40-60%) densities of nerve endings in control samples treated with placebo (P<0.001). Samples treated with test emulsion completely blocked UV-related effects on skin nerve endings. These neuroprotective effects were similarly observed regardless of age or tissue analysed (breast versus abdomen). Conclusion(s): Our new skincare formulation obtained from E. purpurea provides important neuroprotective effects of UV irradiation and could be used together with SPFs to prevent chronic deleterious effects of solar exposure. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Excluded

The mean tumor volume was 3.71 ccm (range: 0.11-22.10 ccm). Based on the protocol guidelines, 21 patients were treated with SRS and 12 patients with SRT, 2 patients received both consecutively.RESULTS: The median follow-up (FU) reached 8 years with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 87.3% [confidence interval (CI): 70.8-95.6%] and 5-year local control rate of 97.1% (CI: 83.4-99.8%). Almost 80% (28/35) presented tumor shrinkage during FU. Endocrinological cure was achieved in 23% and IGF-1 normalization with reduced medication was achieved in 40% of all patients. An endocrinological response was generally achieved within the first 3 years, but endocrinological cure can require more than 8 years. A new adrenocorticotropic hypopituitarism occurred in 13 patients (46.4%). A new visual field disorder and a new oculomotor palsy occurred in 1 patient, respectively. Patients with occurrence of visual/neurological impairments had a longer FU (p = 0.049).CONCLUSION: Our SRS/SRT protocol proved to be safe and successful in terms of tumor control and protection of the visual system. The timing and rate of endocrine improvements are difficult to predict. One has to accept an unavoidable rate of additional adrenocorticotropic hypopituitarism in the long term.",Excluded

816,"Fate of the multiple innervation of cerebellar Purkinje cells by climbing fibers in immature control, x-irradiated and hypothyroid rats The fate of the multiple innervation of Purkinje cells (PCs) by climbing fibers (CFs) was studied as a function of age in immature rats rendered agranular by X-irradiation, in immature hypothyroid rats, and compared to that in controls. This was done by examining in each group the intracellular activities of PCs mediated via CFs throughout maturation. From the third day in control rats, CF responses of PCs evoked by juxta fastigial region (JF) stimulation or occurring spontaneously already resembled the adult responses with, however, some important differences: (1) most of these responses were graded by steps with the intensity of the stimulation before day 13, due to the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs (see below); (2) immature CF responses exhibited a longer duration and their initial spike started near the peak of the EPSP instead of near the baseline later on. Finally, an anlage of CF response was already present in most PCs on day 2, and consisted of a single fast spike elicited near the peak of an underlying all-or-none EPSP. In the 3 groups of rats, CF EPSPs already closely resembled the adult ones as early as 3 days, although their total duration and especially their time to peak were longer. In control rats, these CF EPSPs reversed with depolarizing currents from day 3 and currents for reversal were much lower than in the adult. 'Dual' CF EPSPs of PCS37 were encountered in immature 7- to 10-day-old controls, and persisted in hypothyroid rats until the end of the third postnatal week. The mono- or the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was ascertained in th 3 groups according to the graded or the all-or-none character of CF EPSPs, and the number of CFs impinging on a given PC was estimated by the number of steps in the response. In control rats, most of PCs were already multiply innervated by CFs as early as 3 days. The multiple innervation culminated on day 5 with an average number of 3.4 CFs for PC, and rapidly regressed later on, so that the adult-type monoinnervation was the rule after day 13. In hypothyroid rats, the establishment of the redundancy and its regression was delayed by 2--3 days. In X-irradiated rats, the settlement and the involution of the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was exactly superimposed with that seen in controls until day 8. Later on, regression of the supernumerary contacts no longer occurred so that most PCs remained multiply innervated until adulthood. Finally, the first clear-cut IPSPs were detected in PCs on day 9 in control and X-irradiated rats and 2--3 days later in hypothyroid animals.",Excluded

Mean age was 63 years (standard deviation 12.1) and 56% were women. The radiotherapy fields were breast (35%), abdomen/pelvis (15%), prostate/bladder (21%), head/neck (10%) and other (8%).KEY RESULTS: The patients experiencing nausea within the observed week (n=31) had, compared to the patients not experiencing nausea (n=100), lower ability in daily activities in general (p=0.001), in shopping (p=0.014), walking (p=0.007) and social interaction (p=0.007). Of the patients with nausea 48% had seldom woken up rested and 34% were not able to eat as much as they used to. Corresponding figures for nausea free patients were 27% (not significant; ns) and 16% (ns). Six (5%) experienced vomiting, 15 (12%) diarrhoea, 23 (18%) constipation and 52 (40%) any gastrointestinal symptoms. Forty seven (90%) were negatively bothered by the experienced gastrointestinal symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: The fourth of patients experiencing nausea during radiotherapy had lower ability to perform daily activities than the three quarters of patients who were free from nausea. Few patients vomited while 40% experienced gastrointestinal symptoms during the observed week of radiotherapy.

We utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with multiple b-values (diffusion weightings) to model the dose-dependency and time course of radiation effects on white matter.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with high-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy underwent MRI with DTI prior to radiotherapy, and after months 1, 4-6, and 9-11. Diffusion tensors were calculated using three weightings (high, standard, and low b-values) and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>), and radial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>) were generated. The region of interest was all white matter.RESULTS: MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> increased significantly with time and dose, with corresponding decrease in FA. Greater changes were seen at lower b-values, except for FA. Time-dose interactions were highly significant at 4-6months and beyond (p<.001), and the difference in dose response between high and low b-values reached statistical significance at 9-11months for MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> (p<.001, p<.001, p=.005 respectively) as well as at 4-6months for lambda<sub></sub> (p=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We detected dose-dependent changes across all doses, even <10Gy. Greater changes were observed at low b-values, suggesting prominent extracellular changes possibly due to vascular permeability and neuroinflammation.",Excluded

This study sought to investigate modification of the radiation response in a rat 9L brain tumor model in vivo by the wild-type p53 gene (wtp53). Determination of the timing and dose of radiation therapy required the assessment of the duration of the effect of wtp53 expression on 9L tumors after in vivo transfection. Methods. Anesthetized male F-344 rats each were stereotactically inoculated with 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> 9L gliosarcoma cells through a skull screw into the cerebrum in the right frontal region. Twelve-day-old tumors were inoculated through the screw with recombinant adenoviral vectors under isoflurane anaesthesia: control rats with Ad5/RSV/GL2 (carrying the luciferase gene), and study rats with Ad5CMV-p53 (carrying the wtp53 gene). Brain tumors removed at specific times after transfection were measured, homogenized, and lysed and wtp53 expression determined by Western blot analysis. Four groups of nine rats were, subsequently, implanted with iodine-125 seeds 15 days post-tumor inoculation to give a minimum tumor dose of 40 or 60 Gy. Results. We demonstrated transfer of wtp53 into rat 9L tumors in vivo using the Ad5CMV-p53 vector. The expression of wtp53 was demonstrated to be maximum between days 1 and 3 post-vector inoculation. Tumors expressing wtp53 were smaller than controls transfected with Ad5/RSV/GL2 but this difference was not statistically significant. Radiation made a significant difference to the survival of tumor-bearing rats. Moreover, wtp53 expression conferred a significant additional survival advantage. Conclusion. The expression of wtp53 significantly improves the survival of irradiated tumor-bearing rats in our model.",Excluded

This study sought to determine the efficacy and safety of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) for thyroid cancer patients. Method(s): Thyroid cancer patients with spine metastases were selected and analyzed from a cohort of patients who were prospectively enrolled in two single-institution Phase I/II studies. SSRS was delivered in single or multi-fraction schedules. Dose regimens ranged from 16-18 Gy in one fraction to 27-30 Gy in three to five fractions. Toxicity was graded according to the NCI-CTC toxicity scale. Local control was determined by serial post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging scans showing no evidence of progressive disease. Patients were followed until date of death or date of last known visit for survival analyses. Local control and overall survival rates were carried out using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The log-rank test was used to assess the equality of the survivor function across groups. A p-value of <=0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): A total of 27 spine lesions were treated in 23 patients over a six-year period. Median follow-up was 28.9 months (range 5-93 months). Local control was 88% at two years and 79% at three years. In patients with progressive disease following conventional radiation therapy, local control for salvage SSRS remained at 88% at three years. Patients requiring upfront surgical intervention and treated with adjuvant SSRS achieved sustained control rates of 86% at three years. Overall survival rates were 85% and 67% at one and two years, respectively. In patients classified with oligoprogression and controlled extra-spinal disease, overall survival was significantly higher than those with evidence of systemic progression (81% vs. 45% at two years; p = 0.01). Univariate analysis did not show significant correlations between local control and age, systemic disease status, prior <sup>131</sup>I therapy, SSRS fraction regimen, spine location, histological subtype, or time from initial diagnosis to evidence of spinal metastasis. No patient experienced any grade 3-5 toxicity. Pain flare was reported in 30% of patients, with only three patients (13%) requiring narcotics or short-course steroids. There was no evidence of vertebral body fracture in any patient that achieved local control in the treated area.

EGFR and KRAS testing were done using real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR cobas), BRAF and NRAS using capillary electrophoresis-single strand conformation analysis (CE-SSCA) and ALK and MET using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Any positive results were repeated for confirmation. Any inconsistent results were sequenced using the direct Sanger sequencing. . Result(s): A hundred and five cases of SCLC were identified and 75 FFPE blocks retrieved. Sixty samples were suitable for molecular testing, with 25 examined for all 6 molecular targets successfully. No mutations in EGFR were detected in 31 cases suitable for analysis. KRAS and NRAS mutational analysis was successful in 35 and 37 cases respectively; all of which were wild type. Fifty-eight cases were assessed for ALK gene rearrangements and 42 cases for MET gene amplifications; no rearrangements or amplifications were detected. Forty-seven samples were successfully analysed for BRAF gene mutation, with one V600E mutation detected (2.1% of cases). This patient was a 55 years old Caucasian male smoker who was diagnosed as SCLC, limited stage. He had a history of squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed 6 months prior to the SCLC diagnosis (treated by lobectomy). He responded well to his SCLC treatment (radical chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation). He died nine months after diagnosis. Conclusion(s): EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, ALK and MET were not detected in the examined panel of SCLC patients. A BRAF mutation was identified in a single patient with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, suggesting a mixed pathology tumour rather than a biomarker in SCLC. This panel of biomarkers should no longer be explored in SCLC.",Excluded
589,"Analysis of the layering pattern of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for differentiation of radiation necrosis from tumour progression OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the added value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) for differentiating tumour progression from radiation necrosis.METHODS: Sixteen consecutive patients who underwent removal of a metastatic brain tumour that increased in size after stereotactic radiosurgery were retrospectively reviewed. The layering of the ADC was categorised into three patterns. ADC values were measured on each layer, and the maximum rCBV was measured. rCBV and the layering pattern of the ADC of radiation necrosis and tumour progression were compared.RESULTS: Nine cases of radiation necrosis and seven cases of tumour progression were pathologically confirmed. Radiation necrosis (88.9 % vs. 14.3 %) showed a three-layer pattern of ADC with a middle layer of minimum ADC more frequently. If rCBV larger than 2.6 was used to differentiate radiation necrosis and tumour progression, the sensitivity was 100 % but specificity was 56 %. If the lesions with the three-layer pattern of ADC with moderately increased rCBV (2.6-4.1) were excluded from tumour progression, the sensitivity and specificity increased to 100 %.CONCLUSIONS: The three-layer pattern of ADC shows high specificity in diagnosing radiation necrosis; therefore, combined analysis of the ADC pattern with rCBV may have added value in the correct differentiation of tumour progression from radiation necrosis.",Excluded

649,"[Brain radiotherapy combined with sequential chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases.] BACKGROUND: Brain irradiation is the traditional treatment for NSCLC patients with brain metastases, whereas combined with chemotherapy is the nowadays treatment direction. Since sequential/maintenance chemotherapy has shown promising results in advanced NSCLC, we carried out the study to explore the role of sequential chemotherapy combined with brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases.METHODS: Treatment naive NSCLC patients with brain metastases sequentially received the 3 chemotherapy regimens TP-NP-GP. The TP regimen consisted of Paclitaxol 175 mg/m(2) d1, Cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) d1-5. The NP regimen consisted of Nevalbine 25 mg/m(2) d1 and 8, Cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) d1-5. The GP regimen consisted of Gemcitabine 1 g/m(2) d1 and 8, Cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) d1-5. All regimens were repeated every 3 weeks. Each regimen was executed for at least 2 cycles and no more than 4 cycles.RESULTS: The response rates of TP, NP and GP sequentially used were 41.2%, 35.6% and 27.8% respectively for the out brain lesions and 60.8% for the brain lesions combining with brain irradiation. Median survival time was 14.7 months and the 1, 2 and 3 year overall survivals were 67.8%, 20.6% and 1.3% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The 3rd generation regimen-based sequential chemotherapy combined with WBRT was effective for NSCLC patients with brain metastasis with an encouraging survival and acceptable tolerability.",Excluded
423,"Predictors of postoperative morbidity after laparoscopic versus open radical hysterectomy plus external beam radiotherapy: a propensity-matched comparison BACKGROUND: Identification of peri-operative variables predicting postoperative morbidity may improve postoperative patients' care. We aimed to identify patients' characteristics and operative factors predictive of early (<= 30-day) and late (<= 6-month) morbidity in cervical cancer patients undergoing surgery plus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).METHODS: We studied 45 propensity-matched patient pairs (90 patients) undergoing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (LRH) plus EBRT vs. abdominal radical hysterectomy (RAH) plus EBRT. Basic descriptive, multivariable and artificial neuronal network analyses (ANN) were used to design predicting models influencing outcomes.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the study populations were similar. Patients undergoing LRH experienced lower blood loss (200 (range, 10-700) vs. 400 (range, 100-2000) ml; P < 0.001), shorter length of hospital stay (4 (range, 1-10) vs. 8 (range, 5-52) days; P < 0.001) and similar operative time (235 (+/- 67.3) vs. 258 (+/- 70.2) min; P = 0.14) than patients undergoing RAH. We observed that, at multivariate analysis, open approach correlated with overall (OR: 1.2; 95%CI: 1.03-1.46), early (OR: 1.14; 95%CI:0.99-1.3) and late (OR: 1.13; 95%CI: 1.001-1.28) postoperative complications.CONCLUSIONS: Open approach is the main predictor for developing morbidity among cervical cancer patients undergoing radical hysterectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Laparoscopic surgery enhances peri-operative surgical results and minimizes the occurrence of late complications.",Excluded
808,"Effect of Neoadjuvant Therapy and Rectal Surgery on Health-related Quality of Life in Patients With Rectal Cancer During the First 2 Years After Diagnosis INTRODUCTION: Rectal cancer surgery with neoadjuvant therapy is associated with substantial morbidity. The present study describes the course of quality of life (QOL) in rectal cancer patients in the first 2 years after the start of treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study within a colorectal cancer cohort including rectal cancer patients who were referred for neoadjuvant chemoradiation or short-course radiotherapy and underwent rectal surgery. QOL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and colorectal cancer questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-CR29) before treatment and after 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The outcomes were compared with the QOL scores from the Dutch general population and stratified by low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection. Postoperative bowel dysfunction after low anterior resection was measured using the low anterior resection syndrome score.RESULTS: Of the 324 patients, 272 (84%) responded to at least 2 questionnaires and were included in the present study. Compared with pretreatment levels, the strongest decline was observed in physical, role, and social functioning at 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. Global health and cognitive functioning declined to a lesser extend, and emotional functioning gradually improved over the time. Within 24 months, the QOL scores had recovered toward the pretreatment levels in most patients. Compared with the general population, physical, role, social, and cognitive functioning and symptoms of fatigue and insomnia remained significantly worse in patients on longer-term. After low anterior resection, major bowel dysfunction was reported by 44% to 60% of the patients. Increasing urinary incontinence and severe complaints of impotence were observed in patients who had undergone abdominoperineal resection.CONCLUSION: Rectal cancer treatment is associated with a significant decline in QOL during the first 6 months after the diagnosis. Within 2 years, most patients return toward pretreatment functioning but could still experience poorer functioning and treatment-related symptoms compared with the general population. These findings support shared decision-making and emphasize the need for postoperative supportive care and novel treatment approaches.",Excluded

Skeletal muscle mass was measured as total psoas area and total abdominal muscle area (TAMA) at 3 anatomical levels using the patient's preoperative computed tomography scan. Radiation attenuation was measured using corresponding mean Hounsfield units for TAMA. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as body mass index above 25 kg.m-2 combined with skeletal muscle mass index below the sex-specific median. Postoperative complications were graded by using the -Clavien-Dindo classification.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (25.3%) developed a grade 3-5 complication. Lower radiation attenuation was independently associated with overall (p = 0.003) and grade 3-5 complications (p = 0.002). Sarcopenic obesity was associated with overall complications (all p < 0.05). Skeletal muscle measurements and survival were not significantly related.CONCLUSION: Radiation attenuation was associated with overall and grade 3-5 postoperative morbidity after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and non-laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer.

709,"PET imaging agents for Alzheimer's disease In the past four decades, PET (positron emission tomography) imaging has been developed into a common diagnostic tool. After an i.v. injection of a small amount of radioactive probe, PET images are taken based on the decay of shortlived positron-emitting isotopes. The emitted positron collides with a neighboring electron to produce two 511 KeV gamma rays roughly 180 apart. It is based on this physical principal and the positron coincident signals that the point source of the gamma rays can be deduced by using a coincident circuit for detectors 180 apart. Currently, there are three FDA-approved imaging agents (Amyvid, NeuraCeq, and Vizamyl) available for mapping Abeta in the brain of patients suspected of having Alzheimer's disease. There is a strong interest in measuring tau deposition by PET imaging in a quantitative manner. Several useful Tau imaging agents have been tested in humans; however, they have not been fully validated as those of Abeta imaging agents.

179,"Postoperative radiation for lung cancer metastatic to the brain PURPOSE: Although resection of single brain metastases and postoperative whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) improves survival, compared with treatment using WBRT alone, the value of postoperative WBRT after resection of brain metastases is controversial. We analyzed the largest reported series of lung cancer patients with resected brain metastases to evaluate the impact of postoperative WBRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1989, 185 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) underwent resection of brain metastases. Patients who had received preoperative WBRT (23%, 42 of 185) were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into group A (no WBRT; n = 32), group B (patients received WBRT and were prognostically matched to group A; n = 32), and group C (all other WBRT patients; n = 79). Most patients received postoperative doses of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Higher doses were used in 16% of group B and 18% of group C patients.RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival rates were as follows: group A, 12%; B, 8%; C, 16%. Overall brain failures occurred in 38% of patients in group A, 47% in group B, and 42% in group C. The use of WBRT (group A v groups B plus C) had no apparent impact on survival or on overall brain failure rates. In particular, no improvement in either of these parameters could be demonstrated when group B was compared with group A. Focal failure (defined as failure within the brain adjacent to the site of the resected brain metastases) occurred as follows: group A, 34% (11 of 32); groups B plus C, 23% (25 of 111) (P = .07). WBRT significantly reduced focal failure for patients with adenocarcinoma (group A, 33% [eight of 24]; groups B plus C, 14% [11 of 79]; P = .05). Nonfocal failure (anatomically distinct from the resected metastasis) occurred in 9% of patients in group A (three of 32), 21% in groups B plus C (23 of 111) (P = .07).CONCLUSION: Long-term survival is possible when NSCLC brain metastases are resected. Postoperative WBRT as used in this series only had an impact on the focal control of brain metastases and this effect was of borderline significance. The lack of conclusive benefit supports the need for ongoing randomized trials to test the value of adjuvant postoperative WBRT. Brain failures were relatively common in all three groups of patients, which suggests that doses greater than 30 Gy need to be studied.",Included

943,"Cellular Therapies for Treatment of Radiation Injury: Report from a NIH/NIAID and IRSN Workshop In recent years, there has been increasing concern over the possibility of a radiological or nuclear incident occurring somewhere in the world. Intelligence agencies frequently report that terrorist groups and rogue nations are seeking to obtain radiological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. In addition, there exists the real possibility that safety of nuclear power reactors could be compromised by natural (such as the tsunami and subsequent Fukushima accident in Japan in March, 2011) or accidental (Three Mile Island, 1979 and Chernobyl, 1986) events. Although progress has been made by governments around the world to prepare for these events, including the stockpiling of radiation countermeasures, there are still challenges concerning care of patients injured during a radiation incident. Because the deleterious and pathological effects of radiation are so broad, it is desirable to identify medical countermeasures that can have a beneficial impact on several tissues and organ systems. Cellular therapies have the potential to impact recovery and tissue/organ regeneration for both early and late complications of radiation exposure. These therapies, which could include stem or blood progenitor cells, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or cells derived from other tissues (e.g., endothelium or placenta), have shown great promise in treating other nonradiation injuries to and diseases of the bone marrow, skin, gastrointestinal tract, brain, lung and heart. To explore the potential use of these therapies in the treatment of victims after acute radiation exposure, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases co-sponsored an international workshop in July, 2015 in Paris, France with the Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire. The workshop included discussions of data available from testing in preclinical models of radiation injury to different organs, logistics associated with the practical use of cellular therapies for a mass casualty incident, as well as international regulatory requirements for authorizing such drug products to be legally and readily used in such incidents. This report reviews the data presented, as well as key discussion points from the meeting.",Excluded
508,"Phase II trial of recombinant interferon-alpha-2a and eflornithine in patients with recurrent glioma Interferons alpha and beta have been reported to cause tumor regression in a small proportion of patients with recurrent glioma. Eflornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, reduces cellular polyamine levels and has also been reported to cause tumor regression in patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme. In vitro evidence suggests that interferon and eflornithine are synergistic. In this phase II trial, we investigated the combination of recombinant alpha interferon (36 x 10(6) units/m2 subcutaneously days 3 to 7) and eflornithine (2.25 g/m2 QID PO days 1 to 7) repeated every 28 days. All 29 patients entered in the study were evaluable for toxicity and efficacy. Toxicity consisted primarily of fever, chills, myalgia, weakness and fatigue as well as cortical dysfunction including somnolence, confusion, and exacerbation of underlying neurologic deficits. One patient died from cerebral herniation attributable to interferon. None of the patients experienced objective tumor regression. Seven patients (24%) were stable for more than six months, but the disease stability could also be explained by indolent underlying disease or inability to distinguish recurrent tumor from delayed radiation effects. Intermittent high-dose recombinant interferon alpha plus eflornithine demonstrated no definite antitumor effects in this trial.",Excluded

Preliminary data show that the apparent affinity constant of the cGMP-dependent Ca-binding sites of the disc membranes is of the same (or even higher) order of magnitude as that of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid.

By contrast, many thoracic imaging specialists may be underutilizing thoracic MRI. Recognizing the potential value of thoracic MRI to patient care, we set out to increase its utilization. Material(s) and Method(s): In late 2008 we began updating our nonvascular thoracic MR protocols, incorporating a combination of body and cardiac MRtechniques, creating a more high quality, interpretable examination by consultation with MR applications specialists and cardiac MR technologists and by imaging of volunteers. We reviewed MR protocol principles with our thoracic imaging division and began to show current MR cases regularly at our weekly thoracic imaging case conference. We educated our technologists with in-service presentations and hands-onMR imaging of volunteers to familiarize them with issues and challenges particular to thoracicMRimaging.We have trained our thoracic imaging fellows to protocol, monitor, and interpret these studies and have been educating our referring physicians about MR's value in increasing diagnostic specificity, guiding surgical approach, and preventing unnecessary interventional procedures without radiation exposure. We also retrospectively reviewed thoracic MR utilization from 2009 through 2012. Result(s): Our thoracic MR volume increased from 18 cases in 2009 to 88 cases in 2012 totalling 219 examinations over this period-182 mediastinal, 28 full chest, 5 focused pleural, 2 superior sulcus, and 2 combined neck/upper chest (these numbers exclude brachial plexus MRIs interpreted by our Musculoskeletal Imaging division). Indications included further characterization of thymic, other mediastinal, and pleural lesions, follow-up of thoracic lymphadenopathy, and assessment of chest wall/vascular invasion by lung cancer and mesothelioma. Internists requested 130/219 studies (59%) and surgeons requested 89/219 (41%), with many repeat referrals indicative of a new recognition of thoracic MR's value. Conclusion(s): With continuous updating of thoracic MR protocols, ongoing education of MR technologists and physicians, and incorporation of MR training into thoracic MR fellowship programs, the full contribution of thoracic MR to clinical practice can be realized. Clinical Implication: Improving thoracic MR protocols and educating technologists and physicians promote increased thoracic MR utilization and may improve patient care.",Excluded

Signaling through TrkA kinase domains promotes neuronal survival, whereas activation of the p75(NTR) ""death domains"" induces apoptosis under correct physiological conditions. However, co-expression of these receptors leads to enhanced neuronal survival upon NGF stimulation, possibly through a ternary p75(NTR) x NGF x TrkA complex. We have expressed human p75(NTR) ligand binding domain as a secreted glycosylated protein in Trichoplusia ni cells. Following assembly and purification of soluble p75(NTR) x NGF complexes, mass spectrometry, analytical ultracentrifugation, and solution x-ray scattering measurements are indicative of 2:2 stoichiometry, which implies a symmetric complex. Molecular models of the 2:2 p75(NTR) x NGF complex based on these data are not consistent with the further assembly of either symmetric (2:2:2) or asymmetric (2:2:1) ternary p75(NTR) x NGF x TrkA complexes.",Excluded
1192,"Dim nighttime light impairs cognition and provokes depressive-like responses in a diurnal rodent Circadian disruption is a common by-product of modern life. Although jet lag and shift work are well-documented challenges to circadian organization, many more subtle environmental changes cause circadian disruption. For example, frequent fluctuations in the timing of the sleep/wake schedule, as well as exposure to nighttime lighting, likely affect the circadian system. Most studies of these effects have focused on nocturnal rodents, which are very different from diurnal species with respect to their patterns of light exposure and the effects that light can have on their activity. Thus, the authors investigated the effect of nighttime light on behavior and the brain of a diurnal rodent, the Nile grass rat. Following 3 weeks of exposure to standard light/dark (LD; 14:10 light [~150 lux] /dark [0 lux]) or dim light at night (dLAN; 14:10 light [~150 lux] /dim [5 lux]), rats underwent behavioral testing, and hippocampal neurons within CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG) were examined. Three behavioral effects of dLAN were observed: (1) decreased preference for a sucrose solution, (2) increased latency to float in a forced swim test, and (3) impaired learning and memory in the Barnes maze. Light at night also reduced dendritic length in DG and basilar CA1 dendrites. Dendritic length in the DG positively correlated with sucrose consumption in the sucrose anhedonia task. Nighttime light exposure did not disrupt the pattern of circadian locomotor activity, and all grass rats maintained a diurnal activity pattern. Together, these data suggest that exposure to dLAN can alter affective responses and impair cognition in a diurnal animal.",Excluded

Objectives: Open radical hysterectomy (RH) followed by adjuvant radiation (XRT) for cervical cancer has been associated with high morbidity; however, RHs are now often performed robotically. We examined if the robotic platform decreases the morbidity associated with radical surgery followed by adjuvant XRT. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of patients with cervical cancer undergoing RH from 1995-2013 was performed. Clinical and pathologic data were obtained from the medical record. Long-term (LT) complications were defined as urinary and/or bowel complications, and lymphedema presenting more than 30 days after completion of therapy. Complications were graded. Grade 1 was mild symptoms and easily treated. Grade 2 was symptoms resolving with long-term medical therapy. Grade 3 was major symptoms requiring surgery or invasive procedures. The X<sup>2</sup> and student t tests were used for analysis. Result(s): Overall, 243 patients underwent RH for cervical cancer. The open surgical approach was used in 43% (n = 104) and the robotic approach was used in 57% (n = 139). Eighty-three patients (34.2%) required adjuvant XRT. XRT was associated with increased risk of LT complication (28.9% vs 7.0% P <.001). LT complications included lymphedema (n = 18), bowel-associated complications (enteritis/proctitis n = 8, obstruction n = 2), and urinary complications (hemorrhagic cystitis n = 1, neurogenic bladder n = 2, fistula n = 1, and ureteral stricture n = 3). Among patients who received adjuvant XRT, the open surgical approach was used in 48% (n = 40) and the robotic approach in 52% (n = 43). There was no difference in time to initiation of XRT between the 2 surgical groups (43.2 +/- 15.6 vs 47.3 +/- 19.6 days, P =.33). There was no difference in grade 2/3 LT complications in patients receiving adjuvant XRT between the groups (27.5% vs 27.9%, P =.97). However, patients undergoing open surgery experienced a trend toward increased adhesion-related complications, such as bowel obstruction and ureteral stricture (10% vs 2.3%, P =.19). Conclusion(s): We found no difference in LT complications between patients who underwent robotic and those who underwent open RH and adjuvant XRT. Fewer adhesion-related LT complications may be seen with robotic surgery. However, because many XRT-related complications occur at later time points, continued follow-up is needed to evaluate for potential differences between the 2 groups.",Included

Results were validated using qRT-PCR and confirmed using the regulatable MYCN expression system (SHEP Tet21N).RESULTS: MYCN knockdown altered the expression of several cell cycle related genes. SKP2 was down regulated in both cell lines, and up regulated in MYCN+ Tet21N cells. Expression of the WNT antagonist DKK3 increased in both cell lines and decreased in MYCN+ Tet21N cells. Expression of CDKN1C (p57(cip2)) and TP53INP1 also increased after MYCN knockdown.CONCLUSIONS: MYCN may override the G1 checkpoint through down-regulation of SKP2 and TP53INP1 resulting in reduced p21(WAF1) expression in p53 wt cell lines, and in addition may act through the WNT signaling pathway in a p53 independent manner.",Excluded
1163,"Radiation dose response of normal brain Dose response relationships were determined after hemibrain x-irradiation of normal beagle dogs. Radiation doses of 11.5, 13.5, 14.3, and 17 Gy were delivered in a single dose and results were compared to previous studies using doses of 15 and 30 Gy. Brain injury was quantified using computed tomography (CT), with serial studies obtained monthly up to 1 year following irradiation. Quantitative endpoints included low density volume and contrast enhancement. Doses above 14.3 Gy resulted in high lethality 5-8 months following irradiation, and an LD50 of 14.9 Gy was calculated. At these lethal doses, low density volume representing edema, demyelination, and necrosis had a similar response with an ED50 of 14.6 Gy. Radiation-induced decreases in white matter density appeared 5-6 months after sublethal doses (less than or equal to 14.3 Gy) and the volume of tissue characterized by this low density increased with time and dose. This sublethal low density change had an ED50 of 12.8 Gy, and may reflect a loss or generalized atrophy of glial cells and/or myelin. These results show that: (a) the dose response curves obtained after hemibrain x-irradiation are extremely steep; and (b) at least two processes may be involved in the development of late radiation damage, one that is rapid upon onset (a ""delayed acute"" reaction) and the other which is a slower and more degenerative process.",Included
288,"Ataxia telangiectasia mutant protein activates c-Abl tyrosine kinase in response to ionizing radiation Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder with pleiotropic phenotypes, including neuronal degeneration, immune dysfunction, premature ageing and increased cancer risk. The gene mutated in AT, ATM, encodes a putative lipid or protein kinase. Most of the human AT patient phenotypes are recapitulated in Atm-deficient mice. Cells derived from Atm-/- mice, like those from AT patients, exhibit abnormal response to ionizing radiation. One of the known responses to ionizing radiation is the activation of a nuclear tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-abl proto-oncogene. Ionizing radiation does not activate c-Abl in cells from AT patients or in thymocytes or fibroblasts from the Atm-deficient mice. Ectopic expression of a functional ATM kinase domain corrects this defect, as it phosphorylates the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in vitro at Ser 465, leading to the activation of c-Abl. A mutant c-Abl with Ser 465 changed to Ala 465 is not activated by ionizing radiation or ATM kinase in vivo. These findings identify the c-Abl tyrosine kinase as a downstream target of phosphorylation and activation by the ATM kinase in the cellular response to ionizing radiation.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to determine if the addition of high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy (HDR-IORT) to surgery and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) would improve the outcome in these patients.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-two patients with retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma were prospectively treated according to a protocol that included maximal tumor resection, HDR-IORT, and postoperative EBRT when feasible. Twelve patients presented with primary and 20 with locally recurrent disease. The tumors were high-grade in 20 patients and low-grade in 12 patients. Complete gross resection was achieved in 30 patients. HDR-IORT was given to a dose of 12-15 Gy. Additional EBRT was given to 78% of patients to a dose of 45-50.4 Gy. The two patients with gross residual disease received an additional I-125 permanent implant to a median peripheral dose of 140-160 Gy. The median follow-up was 33 months (range 1-77 mo).RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial local control rate for the whole group was 62%. For patients with primary disease, the local control rate was 74% compared to 54% in patients with recurrent disease (p = 0.4). The overall 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rate was 82%. In patients with high-grade tumors the rate was 70% vs. 100% in those with low-grade tumors. This difference was statistically significant, p = 0.05. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 55% and 45%, respectively. The most common type of post-treatment complication was gastrointestinal obstruction (18%) followed by fistula formation (9%), peripheral neuropathy (6%), hydronephrosis (3%), and wound complication (3%).CONCLUSIONS: We are encouraged by the favorable local control rate and the acceptable morbidity with this new technique applied to a challenging patient population.",Excluded

On the basis of these criteria, we conclude that we have established an in vitro system for the aggregation of microtubule subunits that shares some of the properties characteristic of the in vivo assembly of cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules.",Excluded
972,"The frequency of adverse events by radiation therapy for atomic bomb survivors with cancer Purpose/Objective(s): In Japan, there are many survivors who received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb in 1945. Currently, atomic bomb survivors (ABS) who suffered from cancer are treated as same as usual cancer patients. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse events (AE) of radiation therapy (RT) are increased or not in ABS. To clarify the safety of RT for ABS, we evaluated the frequency of AE by RT in ABS. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients who received curative RT for cancer between 2005 and 2010. We selected the ABS who were officially certified by the Japanese government. AE were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score Ver.3. One hundred and sixty-five ABS were recruited in this study. Median age was 74 years old (59 to 93) and 96 (58.2%) were men. Median age at the time receiving ionizing radiation by atomic bomb was 11 years old (0 to 32). One hundred and thirty-six ABS (82.4%) were pre-treatment performance status (PS) 0, 21 (12.7%) was PS 1, and 8 (4.8%) were PS 2 or over. Thirty-seven were diagnosed with head and neck, 32 with genitourinary, 29 with breast, 27 with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic, 23 with lung and mediastinum, and 17 with other cancer. Result(s): One hundred four ABS were definitive irradiation, 48 were postoperative irradiation, and 13 were pre-operative irradiation. Concurrent chemotherapy was performed on 51. Median dose of external RTwas 50 Gy (30 to 78) based on their cancer type. Fifteen patients were performed on stereotactic RT, 12 on intensity-modulated RT, and 11 on brachytherapy. All patients were received standard dose irradiation and completed planned RT. No patients received extended RTover 1 week. Median observation time was 40 months (1 to 84). One hundred fifty-six patients (94.5%) were alive and 9 (5.5%) were dead when at the time investigated. There were no patients who died of AE in the entire course. In acute AE, sixteen patients (9.7%) were classified into grade 3 or above, i.e. one with esophageal mucositis and 15 with hematotoxicity (Grade 3: 11, Grade 4: 4). All these patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Grade 4 or 5 non-hematotoxicitic AE was not identified. In late AE, twelve patients (7.3%) were classified into Grade 3 or above. Four patients were classified into Grade 4, i.e. 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 with cerebral infarction. Conclusion(s): Notable incensements of AE were not observed during and after RT for ABS. This study clarified that standard dose RT prescription can be administered safely to ABS with cancer even though they received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb before half century.",Excluded
917,"The Association of Socioeconomic Status with the Burden of Cataract-related Blindness and the Effect of Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure: An Ecological Study Objective: To assess the association of socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract blindness in terms of year lived with disability (YLD) rates and to determine whether ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels modify the effect of socioeconomic status on this health burden.Methods: National and subnational age-standardized YLD rates associated with cataract-related blindness were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017. The human development index (HDI) from the Human Development Report was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. Estimated ground-level UVR exposure was obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) dataset of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).Results: Across 185 countries, socioeconomic status was inversely associated with the burden of cataract blindness. Countries with a very high HDI had an 84% lower age-standardized YLD rate [95% confidence interval ( CI): 60%-93%, P < 0.001] than countries with a low HDI; for high-HDI countries, the proportion was 76% (95% CI: 53%-88%, P < 0.001), and for medium-HDI countries, the proportion was 48% (95% CI: 15%-68%, P = 0.010; P for trend < 0.001). The interaction analysis showed that UVR exposure played an interactive role in the association between socioeconomic status and cataract blindness burden ( P value for interaction = 0.047).Conclusion: Long-term high-UVR exposure amplifies the association of poor socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract-related blindness. The findings emphasize the need for strengthening UVR exposure protection interventions in developing countries with high-UVR exposure.",Excluded

218,"Choroideremia: melanopsin-mediated postillumination pupil relaxation is abnormally slow PURPOSE: To investigate the rod-cone and melanopsin pupillary light response (PLR) pathways in choroideremia.METHODS: Eight patients with choroideremia and 18 healthy age-matched controls underwent chromatic pupillometry by applying blue (463 nm) and red light (643 nm) at 100 lux intensity to the right eye while recording pupil diameters. Absolute baseline pupil size (mm), normalized maximal pupil constriction and the early and late postillumination pupillary dilation, from 0 to 10 seconds and 10 to 30 seconds after the end of illumination, respectively, were determined. Postillumination responses to blue light were considered to be primarily driven by melanopsin activation of the intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.RESULTS: Baseline pupil diameters were comparable in patients with choroideremia and control subjects (p = 0.48). The maximum pupil constriction in patients with choroideremia was severely weakened in red light but only mildly weakened in blue light (p < 0.05). Postillumination dilation of the pupil was normal after red illumination but extremely protracted after blue illumination. Also, in contrast to healthy subjects, no abrupt change in the dilation curve was seen in the patients after the end of blue illumination, the early-phase dilation being completely abolished (p < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Rod-cone-driven pupil responses were decreased as expected in an outer retinal degeneration, and near-normal pupil constriction in blue light supports that the melanopsin system is normal. In contrast, the lack of brisk early-phase dilation after blue illumination in choroideremia is remarkable and may be interpreted to mean that the absence of photoreceptor inhibition promotes a tonic contraction of the pupil.",Excluded
807,"Measuring inflammation in brains of NFL players using [11c]DPA-713 PET Background: Former National Football League (NFL) players have higher rates of delayed neurological, cognitive and affective impairments. Those impairments have been attributed to pathologic effects of repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI), characterized by shearing of neuronal axons and inflammatory response. We recently showed that [11C]DPA-713 PET-based neuroimaging (DPA-PET) is a promising tool to quantify increased expression of translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of brain injury and repair, in former NFL players. Here we sought to use DPA-PET in active and recently retired NFL players to test for changes in binding to TSPO. Method(s): We quantified regional distribution (VT) of TSPO using DPA-PET in the brains of a novel set of nine active and recently retired NFL players and eight age-matched, athletic, healthy controls. Diffusion tensor imaging was also completed to evaluate white matter changes in the brains of these individuals. Result(s): Using two-way ANOVA with cohort (NFL players, controls) and TSPO genotype as fixed factors, DPA-PET VT values were signiflcantly increased in several brain regions in NFL players compared to controls, particularly in thalamus and brainstem. We also found signiflcantly diminished fractional anisotrophy in the right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR) and signiflcantly increased mean diffusivity (MD) in bilateral PTRs. Conclusion(s): Findings from this pilot study of young NFL players support a model wherein microglial activation is an early, persistent response in select brain structures after rmTBI. DPA-PET in NFL athletes may prove useful in further characterizing the inflammatory response after rmTBI and in probing the mechanistic link to onset of cognitive and affective disease.",Excluded
1197,"Occupational magnetic field exposure and the risk of acoustic neuroma BACKGROUND: Acoustic neuroma is the intracranial tumor subtype showing the highest relative risk in relation to ionizing radiation but other environmental risk factors are largely unknown. This study was performed to investigate the effect of power frequency magnetic fields.METHOD: A total of 793 cases between 1987 and 1999 were identified through the Swedish cancer registry and 101,762 controls were randomly selected from the total population. Information about occupation was obtained from censuses and linked to gender specific job-exposure matrices based on actual measurements of 50 Hz magnetic field exposure.RESULT: We investigated time-weighted average, peak values, and rate of change of magnetic field exposure considering several different time windows in relation to cancer diagnosis. We found no increases in risks regardless of exposure metric or time window of exposure.CONCLUSION: This study is the largest ever on acoustic neuroma and the first study to evaluate this tumor subtype specifically in relation to extremely low frequency magnetic fields. The results do not support the hypothesis that 50 Hz magnetic fields increase the risk of acoustic neuroma.",Excluded
478,"Sparing of normal tissues with volumetric arc radiation therapy for glioblastoma: Single institution clinical experience Background: Patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) require radiotherapy as part of definitive management. Our institution has adopted the use of volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) due to superior sparing of the adjacent organs at risk (OARs) compared to intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Here we report our clinical experience by analyzing target coverage and sparing of OARs for 90 clinical treatment plans. Method(s): VMAT and IMRT patient cohorts comprising 45 patients each were included in this study. For all patients, the planning target volume (PTV) received 50Gy in 30 fractions, and the simultaneous integrated boost PTV received 60Gy. The characteristics of the two patient cohorts were examined for similarity. The doses to target volumes and OARs, including brain, brainstem, hippocampi, optic nerves, eyes, and cochleae were then compared using statistical analysis. Target coverage and normal tissue sparing for six patients with both clinical IMRT and VMAT plans were analyzed. Result(s): PTV coverage of at least 95% was achieved for all plans, and the median mean dose to the boost PTV differed by only 0.1Gy between the IMRT and VMAT plans. Superior sparing of the brainstem was found with VMAT, with a median difference in mean dose being 9.4Gy. The ipsilateral cochlear mean dose was lower by 19.7Gy, and the contralateral cochlea was lower by 9.5Gy. The total treatment time was reduced by 5min. The difference in the ipsilateral hippocampal D<inf>100%</inf> was 12Gy, though this is not statistically significant (P=0.03). Conclusion(s): VMAT for GBM patients can provide similar target coverage, superior sparing of the brainstem and cochleae, and be delivered in a shorter period of time compared with IMRT. The shorter treatment time may improve clinical efficiency and the quality of the treatment experience. Based on institutional clinical experience, use of VMAT for the treatment of GBMs appears to offer no inferiority in comparison to IMRT and may offer distinct advantages, especially for patients who may require re-irradiation.

1079,"Renal Function Assessment During Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy Theranostics labeled with Y-90 or Lu-177 are highly efficient therapeutic approaches for the systemic treatment of various cancers including neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has been used for many years for metastatic or inoperable neuroendocrine tumors. However, renal and hematopoietic toxicities are the major limitations for this therapeutic approach. Kidneys have been considered as the ""critical organ"" because of the predominant glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption by the proximal tubules, and interstitial retention of the tracers. Severe nephrotoxity, which has been classified as grade 4-5 based on the ""Common Terminology Criteria on Adverse Events,"" was reported in the range from 0%-14%. There are several risk factors for renal toxicity; patient-related risk factors include older age, preexisting renal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous nephrotoxic chemotherapy, metastatic lesions close to renal parenchyma, and single kidney. There are also treatment-related issues, such as choice of radionuclide, cumulative radiation dose to kidneys, renal radiation dose per cycle, activity administered, number of cycles, and time interval between cycles. In the literature, nephrotoxicity caused by PRRT was documented using different criteria and renal function tests, from serum creatinine level to more accurate and sophisticated methods. Generally, serum creatinine level was used as a measure of kidney function. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation based on serum creatinine was preferred by several authors. Most commonly used formulas for estimation of GFR are ""Modifications of Diet in Renal Disease"" (MDRD) equation and ""Cockcroft-Gault"" formulas. However, more precise methods than creatinine or creatinine clearance are recommended to assess renal function, such as GFR measurements using Tc-99m-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), Cr-51-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), or measurement of Tc-99m-MAG3 clearance, particularly in patients with preexisting risk factors for long-term nephrotoxicity. Proximal tubular reabsorption and interstitial retention of tracers result in excessive renal irradiation. Coinfusion of positively charged amino acids, such as l-lysine and l-arginine, is recommended to decrease the renal retention of the tracers by inhibiting the proximal tubular reabsorption. Furthermore, nephrotoxicity may be reduced by dose fractionation. Patient-specific dosimetric studies showed that renal biological effective dose of <0Gy was safe for patients without any risk factors. A renal threshold value <28Gy was recommended for patients with risk factors. Despite kidney protection, renal function impairment can occur after PRRT, especially in patients with risk factors and high single or cumulative renal absorbed dose. Therefore, patient-specific dosimetry may be helpful in minimizing the renal absorbed dose while maximizing the tumor dose. In addition, close and accurate renal function monitoring using more precise methods, rather than plasma creatinine levels, is essential to diagnose the early renal functional changes and to follow-up the renal function during the treatment.",Excluded
298,"Microstructural white matter correlates of motor fatigue in multiple sclerosis-a diffusion weighted imaging study Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). It contributes significantly to reduced quality of life. Some studies suggest that fatigue is a consequence of microstructural disease alterations in specific white matter (WM) tracts - e.g., right anterior thalamic radiation (rATR) (Bester 2013, Gobbi 2014). However, others have not been able to find any associations between WM changes and fatigue. Consequently, the role of microstructural WM changes in the pathophysiology of fatigue remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between WM microstructural brain pathology and motor fatigue in MS. Method(s): We included 50 mildly disabled relapsing remitting MS patients from the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Centre and 25 age -and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Fatigue was evaluated with the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC). Additionally, all participants underwent a standard MS test-battery and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination including conventional scans and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI). i) The local microstructural brain structures were assessed with fractional anisotropy (FA) for detecting the voxelwise indicating indices of WM abnormalities compared to HC. ii) The disruption of neural fibres connecting specific brain areas was assessed with anatomical connectivity mapping (ACM), which reflects the strength of connectedness of each WM voxel to the entire brain (Lyksborg 2014). iii) We also assessed the correlation between fatigue scores and MS-related WM pathology. Result(s): Relative to HC, MS patients showed reduced FA and ACM in the body of the corpus callosum (CC) containing motor fibres (p< 0.001 and p=0.022 respectively, FWE corrected at the cluster level). We did not find statistically significant correlations between motor fatigue and microstructural disease alterations in rATR (p>0.900) (extracted with the JHU White-Matter Tractography Atlas) or using a whole brain white-matter mask (p>0.706). Conclusion(s): The microstructure in the body of CC, including the transcallosal motor fibres, was significantly altered in the MS group relative to HC. This suggests that individuals with MS have a changed interhemispheric connectivity in the commissural motor fibres. Since we found no association between regional WM microstructure and fatigue, our data do not support the notion that a local structural WM change may be critical for the emergence of fatigue in MS.",Excluded
266,"[The action of ionizing radiation on DNA replication in the cells of a healthy human subject and of a patient with Down's syndrome] Using DNA fiber autoradiography we have revealed a new defect earlier unknown in Down's syndrome but analogous to that earlier shown by the authors in AT and basal cell nevus. This syndrome involves a significantly decreased number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons compared to that in normal cells., the rate of fork movement and the fusion of neighbouring units in the group being unchanged. Ionizing radiation (5 Gy) does not change the rate of DNA chain growth in the cells derived from the affected individuals, however, it significantly reduces this parameter in normal cells due to inhibition of replicon initiation in the whole clusters. Thus, radioresistant DNA synthesis in chromosomal instability syndromes may be explained by some defect in DNA replication in unirradiated cells analogous to that in irradiated normal cells.",Included

The PET study was prompted by growth of the tumor in spite of therapy, or regrowth after an initially favorable response. Increased accumulation of FDG was seen in 14 patients (group 1) and decreased in 17 (group 2). Patients in group 1 had verified tumor growth in 9 of 14 cases. The median survival after radiosurgery was 12.3 months. One patient in this group is still alive after open surgery of a recurrent metastasis. Six patients in group 2 are still alive. The median survival after radiosurgery was 19.9 months. Verified radiation reaction/necrosis was found in 5/17 and viable tumor tissue in 2. The survival time in group 2 was significantly longer than in group 1. PET is superior to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the differentiation between recurrence and radiation reaction/necrosis. However, temporary radiation effects may mask remaining tumor tissue, and repeat PET studies may sometimes be necessary.",Excluded

The cohort size was increased by 19% and follow-up extended by 3 years over the previous analysis. Radiation doses were estimated using an updated dosimetry system: Mayak Worker Dosimetry System 2008 (MWDS-2008). For the first time, in an analysis of this cohort, quantitative smoking data were used. Workers of the study cohort were exposed occupationally to prolonged external gamma rays and internal alpha particles. The mean (+/-standard deviation) total dose from external gamma rays was 0.54 +/- 0.76 Gy (95% percentile 2.21 Gy) for males and 0.44 +/- 0.65 Gy (95% percentile 1.87 Gy) for females. The mean plutonium body burden in the 31% of workers monitored for internal exposure was 1.32 +/- 4.87 kBq (95% percentile 4.71 kBq) for males and 2.21 +/- 13.24 kBq (95% percentile 4.56 kBq) for females. The mean total absorbed alpha-particles dose to the liver from incorporated plutonium was 0.23 +/- 0.77 Gy (95% percentile 0.89 Gy) in males and 0.44 +/- 2.11 Gy (95% percentile 1.25 Gy) in females. After adjusting for nonradiation factors (gender, age, calendar period, employment period, facility, smoking, alcohol consumption), there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence associated with total absorbed dose from external gamma rays and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal alpha-particle radiation exposure. Excess relative risks per Gy (ERR/Gy) were 0.46 (95% CI 0.37, 0.57) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16, 0.42), respectively, based on a linear dose-response model. Adjustments for additional factors (hypertension, body mass index, duration of employment, smoking index and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal exposure during the analysis of external exposure and vice versa) had little effect on the results. The categorical analyses showed that CVD incidence was significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses and that CVD incidence was also significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-particle doses to the liver from incorporated plutonium greater than 0.01 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. The results of the categorical analyses of CVD incidence were in good agreement with a linear dose response for external gamma-ray doses but for internal alpha-particle doses the picture was less clear. For the first time an excess risk of CVD mortality was seen in workers whose livers were exposed to internal alpha-particle doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those workers who were exposed to doses of less than 0.01 Gy. A significant increasing trend for CVD mortality with internal alpha-particle dose was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed at doses <1.0 Gy after having adjusted for nonradiation factors, ERR/Gy = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.09, 1.92). These updated results provide good evidence for a linear trend in risk of CVD incidence with external gamma-ray dose. The trend for CVD incidence with internal alpha-particle dose is less clear due to the impact of issues concerning the use of dose estimates based on below the limit of detection bioassay measurements.",Included
575,"Avoiding neuromuscular stimulation in liver irreversible electroporation using radiofrequency electric fields Electroporation-based treatments typically consist of the application of high-voltage dc pulses. As an undesired side effect, these dc pulses cause electrical stimulation of excitable tissues such as motor nerves. The present in vivo study explores the use of bursts of sinusoidal voltage in a frequency range from 50 kHz to 2 MHz, to induce irreversible electroporation (IRE) whilst avoiding neuromuscular stimulation. A series of 100 dc pulses or sinusoidal bursts, both with an individual duration of 100 micros, were delivered to rabbit liver through thin needles in a monopolar electrode configuration, and thoracic movements were recorded with an accelerometer. Tissue samples were harvested three hours after treatment and later post-processed to determine the dimensions of the IRE lesions. Thermal damage due to Joule heating was ruled out via computer simulations. Sinusoidal bursts with a frequency equal to or above 100 kHz did not cause thoracic movements and induced lesions equivalent to those obtained with conventional dc pulses when the applied voltage amplitude was sufficiently high. IRE efficacy dropped with increasing frequency. For 100 kHz bursts, it was estimated that the electric field threshold for IRE is about 1.4 kV cm<sup>-1</sup> whereas that of dc pulses is about 0.5 kV cm<sup>-1</sup>.",Excluded

Therefore, the authors evaluated the long term efficacy and toxicity of treatment with radiotherapy and concurrent carboplatin plus teniposide followed by three cycles of carmustine in patients who underwent resection for glioblastoma.METHODS: Fifty-six newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma underwent radiotherapy (1.8-2 gray [Gy]/day, 5 days a week using limited fields up to 60 Gy), and concurrent chemotherapy with carboplatin (350 mg/m2) on Days 1, 22, and 43, and teniposide (50 mg/m2) on Days 1, 2, 3, 22, 23, 24, 43, 44, and 45. Four weeks after the end of radiotherapy, patients were given carmustine (200 mg/m2) every 8 weeks for 3 cycles. Treatment then was suspended, but if disease progression was found, treatment was resumed using different drugs.RESULTS: All 56 patients were evaluated for time to progression (TTP) and median survival time (MST). The TTP was 7.5 months and the MST was 12.5 months. Toxicity manifested as thrombocytopenia and in most cases was acceptable. Four patients (7.1%) had radiation necrosis at 2, 2, 7, and 9 months, respectively, from the end of radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the current study with concurrent radiochemotherapy in patients with glioblastoma are comparable to the best results reported using radiotherapy alone followed by chemotherapy with nitrosoureas.",Excluded

664,"Pituitary Apoplexy in a patient with Nelson's Syndrome Objective: To present a rare case of Nelson's syndrome treated with surgeries and radiation with multiple recurrences and subsequent development of pituitary apoplexy. Clinical case:A 66-year-old man with a history of Cushing's syndrome was treated with subtotal adrenalectomy and external pituitary irradiation in 1964. In 2004 he was diagnosed with Nelson's syndrome. MRI demonstrated 1 x 2 cm pituitary macroadenoma invading the right cavernous sinus and suprasellar cistern. The patient underwent transsphenoidal resection (TSSR) of the tumor in 2005. However, ACTH level increased to 8,310 pg/mL within a year. At the same time, right-sided ptosis and diplopia developed. MRI revealed further enlargement of the adenoma. The patient underwent craniotomy in 2006 and most of the tumor was removed except for a small residual portion invading the wall of the carotid artery. Although ACTH reached a nadir of 1,543 pg/mL postoperatively, it rebounded to 14,652 pg/mL in nine months. Another MRI revealed recurrent pituitary macroadenoma and in 2008 the patient again underwent TSSR of the tumor followed by radiation. Treatment with cabergoline and octreotide was initiated but the response was only transient as both ACTH and residual tumor increased. In November of 2012, patient presented to the emergency room with severe headache and palsy of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. A MRI revealed 3.2 cm pituitary adenoma with suprasellar extension and encasement of the right internal carotid artery, but no hemorrhage, midline shift, or mass effect was noted. One week after hospitalization, serum ACTH declined to 2183 pg/mL and headaches completely resolved. Clinical diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy was established. Discussion(s): Pituitary apoplexy is a known complication of Nelson's Syndrome. Previous literature has described increased frequency of apoplexy in the setting of Nelson's syndrome when compared to pituitary adenomas in general (1). Although apoplexy is commonly accompanied by evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis on imaging, it is not required for the diagnosis (2). Conclusion(s): We present a case of pituitary apoplexy in a patient with Nelson's syndrome resistant to surgical, medical and radiation therapy. Apoplexy was confirmed clinically and biochemically, without evidence of hemorrhage on imaging. This case illustrates the clinical course and complications of Nelson's syndrome.",Excluded

The main goal thereby is to maintain in-flight and post-flight performance capabilities of the astronauts (Loehr et al., 2015). Crewmembers are commanded to adhere to their personal exercise protocols, including resistance (ARED) and cardiovascular exercise on a Treadmill or Veloergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System (TVIS, CEVIS). The training devices save personal data as well as physiological and training parameter, which allows the Mission Control Center (based on Earth) to adjust individual exercise schedules. Since the installation of the ARED in the International Space Station Expedition 18, high resistances can be applied during strength training on the ISS and the device allows about 29 different exercises. However, the ARED is very space-consuming and carries the potential risk of being temporarily unavailable due to technical faults (Hanson et al., 2014; Loehr et al., 2015), which motivates the search for and the exploration of smaller and technically simpler devices (Behringer et al., 2016). In addition, high training intensities are associated with an increased risk of injury to the musculoskeletal system (Gabbett, 2016), a fact to be taken seriously, as training-related injuries are the most common source of injury to astronauts on board the ISS (Scheuring et al., 2009). Therefore, the question arises whether BFR training can be a reasonable alternative or supplement for in-flight training sessions.

496,"Sacral tumors confounding the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy: A case report Case Description: Patient: A 53-year-old man with progressive low back pain and symmetric lower limb weakness. In 2007, the patient was found to have sacral and coccygeal tumors with recommended observation. In 2011, with progressive lower limb weakness thought attributable to the masses, he received radiation following biopsy. He presented with progressive symptoms in 2013 and was found to have marked lower limb weakness and a mixed Trendelenburg and steppage gait. He minimized his weakness and was pain focused. Setting(s): Academic medical center. Results or Clinical Course: Electrodiagnostic studies revealed diffuse myopathy without neurogenic injury referable to the sacrococcygeal masses. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed paraspinal atrophy in addition to the sacral and coccygeal masses, for which biopsy revealed chordoma and glomangioma, respectively. Upon discussing test results, the patient revealed a strong family history of adult-onset muscular dystrophy, which he had not offered originally. Discussion(s): Chordomas and glomangiomas are rare tumors. This is the first case report of these occurring simultaneously. Although symptoms vary based upon location, both commonly present with localized pain. Chordomas are malignant spinal bone tumors and glomangiomas are benign mesenchymal neoplasms. For our patient, the myopathy diagnosis was confounded by the tumors, which were assumed to cause lower limb weakness. The distribution of weakness and location of the tumors were discordant and further evaluation revealed myopathy as the cause of the lower limb weakness, likely due to familial muscular dystrophy. Conclusion(s): We report the first case of chordoma and glomangioma occurring concomitantly. This case highlights 1) even in close anatomic proximity, bony masses may represent different pathologies with distinct prognoses and treatments, and 2) the importance of a good clinical examination in expanding the differential diagnosis when the clinical deficit pattern is distinct from what is anticipated based on imaging.",Excluded
999,"Correction of prototypic ATM splicing mutations and aberrant ATM function with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides We used antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMOs) to redirect and restore normal splicing of three prototypic splicing mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. Two of the mutations activated cryptic 5' or 3' splice sites within exonic regions; the third mutation activated a downstream 5' splice site leading to pseudoexon inclusion of a portion of intron 28. AMOs were targeted to aberrant splice sites created by the mutations; this effectively restored normal ATM splicing at the mRNA level and led to the translation of full-length, functional ATM protein for at least 84 h in the three cell lines examined, as demonstrated by immunoblotting, ionizing irradiation-induced autophosphorylation of ATM, and transactivation of ATM substrates. Ionizing irradiation-induced cytotoxicity was markedly abrogated after AMO exposure. The ex vivo data strongly suggest that the disease-causing molecular pathogenesis of such prototypic mutations is not the amino acid change of the protein but the mutated DNA code itself, which alters splicing. Such prototypic splicing mutations may be correctable in vivo by systemic administration of AMOs and may provide an approach to customized, mutation-based treatment for ataxia-telangiectasia and other genetic disorders.",Excluded

210,"Long-term cognitive profile and incidence of dementia after STN-DBS in Parkinson's disease An effect of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) on cognition has been suspected but long-term observations are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term cognitive profile and the incidence of dementia in a cohort of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated by STN-DBS. 57 consecutive patients were prospectively assessed by the mean of a neuropsychological battery over 3 years after surgery. Dementia (DSM-IV) and UPDRS I to IV were recorded. 24.5% of patients converted to dementia over 3 years (incidence of 89 of 1,000 per year). This group of patients cognitively continuously worsened over 3 years up to fulfilling dementia criteria (PDD). The rest of the cohort remained cognitively stable (PD) over the whole follow-up. Preoperative differences between PDD and PD included older age (69.2 +/- 5.8 years; 62.6 +/- 8 years), presence of hallucinations and poorer executive score (10.1 +/- 5.9; 5.5 +/- 4.4). The incidence of dementia over 3 years after STN-DBS is similar to the one reported in medically treated patients. The PDD presented preoperative risk factors of developing dementia similar to those described in medically treated patients. These observations suggest dementia being secondary to the natural evolution of PD rather than a direct effect of STN-DBS.",Excluded
845,"Numerical evaluation of temporal focusing characteristics in transparent and scattering media Temporal focusing is a simple approach for achieving tight, optically sectioned excitation in nonlinear microscopy and multiphoton photo-manipulation. Key applications and advantages of temporal focusing involve propagation through scattering media, but the progressive broadening of the temporal focus has not been characterized. By combining a detailed geometrical optics model with Monte-Carlo scattering simulations we introduce and validate a simulation strategy for predicting temporal focusing characteristics in scattering and non-scattering media. The broadening of the temporal focus width with increasing depth in brain tissue is studied using both simulations and experiments for several key optical geometries, and an analytical approximation is found for the dependence of this broadening on the microscope's parameters in a transparent medium. Our results indicate that a multiphoton temporal focus has radically different broadening characteristics in deep tissue than those of a spatial focus.",Excluded
97,"Temperature dependence of radiation-induced DNA-protein crosslinks formed under hypoxic conditions Recently, we demonstrated that the oxygen dependence of the formation of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) in irradiated mammalian cells measured by the alkaline elution technique is the mirror image of the oxygen dependence of radiation-induced cell killing. Consequently, these radiation-induced DPCs could be used to detect hypoxic cells or estimate the hypoxic fraction of cells in solid tumors. Although several techniques, including alkaline elution, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and nitrocellulose filter binding, have been used to measure radiation-induced DPCs, the published reports suggest that the characteristics of these DPCs may depend on both the type of sample irradiated (cellular compared to model systems, oxygenated compared to hypoxic, etc.) and the technique used to measure these radiation-induced DPCs. In the present study, the radiation-induced DPCs measured by our alkaline elution technique with and without proteinase K in the lysis solution were characterized by studying the dependence of their formation on temperature in hypoxic rat 9L brain tumor cells. Exponentially growing 9L rat brain tumor cells were rendered hypoxic at 4degreeC or at 37degreeC and then irradiated with either 7.5 Gy or 15 Gy. The cells were trypsinized at 4degreeC, either immediately after the irradiation or after one half-time of strand break repair at 37degreeC. The results demonstrated that the radiation- induced DPCs produced in 9L cells under hypoxic conditions, measured by our alkaline elution technique after low to moderate radiation doses, required metabolism for their formation, unlike the radiation-induced DPCs reported by others using the GC/MS or nitrocellulose filter binding technique.",Excluded

840,Accurate localization of optic radiation during neurosurgery in an interventional MRI suite Accurate localization of the optic radiation is key to improving the surgical outcome for patients undergoing anterior temporal lobe resection for the treatment of refractory focal epilepsy. Current commercial interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners are capable of performing anatomical and diffusion weighted imaging and are used for guidance during various neurosurgical procedures. We present an interventional imaging workflow that can accurately localize the optic radiation during surgery. The workflow is driven by a near real-time multichannel nonrigid image registration algorithm that uses both anatomical and fractional anisotropy pre- and intra-operative images. The proposed workflow is implemented on graphical processing units and we perform a warping of the pre-operatively parcellated optic radiation to the intra-operative space in under 3 min making the proposed algorithm suitable for use under the stringent time constraints of neurosurgical procedures. The method was validated using both a numerical phantom and clinical data using pre- and post-operative images from patients who had undergone surgery for treatment of refractory focal epilepsy and shows strong correlation between the observed post-operative visual field deficit and the predicted damage to the optic radiation. We also validate the algorithm using interventional MRI datasets from a small cohort of patients. This work could be of significant utility in image guided interventions and facilitate effective surgical treatments.,Excluded

The water permeabilities of whole brain and testis mitochondria as well as liposome models of the lipid bilayer composing the liver inner mitochondrial membrane are also characterized.

Direct AC in image-space, wherein PET images corrected for attenuation and scatter are synthesized from nonattenuation corrected PET (PET-nonAC) images in an end-to-end fashion using deep learning approaches (DLAC) is evaluated for various radiotracers used in molecular neuroimaging studies.

The PET data were reconstructed using CT-based AC (CTAC) to generate reference PET-CTAC and without AC to produce PET-nonAC images. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to generate PET attenuation corrected images (PET-DLAC) from PET-nonAC. The quantitative accuracy of this approach was investigated separately for each radiotracer considering the values obtained from PET-CTAC images as reference. A segmented AC map (PET-SegAC) containing soft-tissue and background air was also included in the evaluation. Quantitative analysis of PET images demonstrated superior performance of the DLAC approach compared to SegAC technique for all tracers. Despite the relatively low quantitative bias observed when using the DLAC approach, this approach appears vulnerable to outliers, resulting in noticeable local pseudo uptake and false cold regions. Direct AC in image-space using deep learning demonstrated quantitatively acceptable performance with less than 9% absolute SUV bias for the four different investigated neuroimaging radiotracers. However, this approach is vulnerable to outliers which result in large local quantitative bias. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Human Brain Mapping published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

As a rule, Sr applicators were sutured in patients with tumors up to 3.5 mm thick and Ru ones in cases with tumors thicker than 3.5 mm. A special program was used for individual approach and improving the accuracy of planning. A total of 74.5% of patients have been followed up for at least 3 years, with check-ups every 3-6 months. The effect of brachytherapy was considered positive in cases with complete resorption or at least 50% decrease of the tumor and a stable clinical picture for 9-12 months. In 60% of patients the tumor regressed completely, in 16% partially, and in 24% there were signs of activation of melanoma growth one year after treatment. The frequency of radiation complications was as follows: retinopaty, 3.15%; neuroretinopathy, 1.1%; hemophthalmia, 0.9%; neovascular glaucoma, 1.1%; cataract, 0.63%.

21,"Clinical outcome after fractionated radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma Purpose/Objective(s): Pituitary tumors are relatively uncommon. Primary goals of treatment include normalization of hormonal level and improving visual or neurological symptoms. Surgery, medical treatment, irradiation, or combination of these modalities is used to achieve these goals. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the clinical outcome of pituitary adenoma treated with fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of pituitary adenoma treated at our center between 2006 and 2014. A total of 88 patients with biopsy-proven adenomas were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (18-79 years) and 49 patients (56%) were males. Majority of tumors were marcoadenoma (87%). Presenting symptoms were mainly hormonal disturbance in 43 patients (49%), visual defects in 29 patients (33%) and headache in 21 patients (23%). Prolactinomas were the most common secretory adenoma in 22 patients (51%), followed by growth hormone secreting adenomas in 15 patients (35%) and ACTH-secreting tumors in 5 patients (12%), while one patient had TSH-secreting adenoma. The cohort follow up time reached 87 months (mean; 32 months). The primary endpoints are clinical and biochemical control. Result(s): Thirteen patients lost to follow up, therefore 75 patients were included in the final analysis. Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 70 patients (93%).While medical treatment was used for inoperable or hormonal secreting adenoma in 30 patients (40%). Fractionated radiation therapy was delivered to 28 patients (37%), indications for radiation were symptomatic, incompletely resected tumors (16 patients) or persistent hypersecretion (12 patients). For secretory tumors the median radiation dose was 52Gy (50-54Gy), and lower dose was delivered for non-secretory adenoma; mean 50Gy (45-52Gy). For patients received radiation therapy, the tumor control rate is 75% for non-functioning adenomas, and 69% for functioning adenomas. Conclusion(s): Pituitary adenoma is a slow growing benign tumor; however devastating effect can result from neurological deficits or hormonal imbalance. Our results reveal that functioning adenomas carry worse prognosis. Fractionated radiation therapy, as an adjunct to surgery and medical treatment, offers good clinical and biochemical control for pituitary adenoma.

1153,"Use of synchrotron medical microbeam irradiation to investigate radiation-induced bystander and abscopal effects in vivo The question of whether bystander and abscopal effects are the same is unclear. Our experimental system enables us to address this question by allowing irradiated organisms to partner with unexposed individuals. Organs from both animals and appropriate sham and scatter dose controls are tested for expression of several endpoints such as calcium flux, role of 5HT, reporter assay cell death and proteomic profile. The results show that membrane related functions of calcium and 5HT are critical for true bystander effect expression. Our original inter-animal experiments used fish species whole body irradiated with low doses of X-rays, which prevented us from addressing the abscopal effect question. Data which are much more relevant in radiotherapy are now available for rats which received high dose local irradiation to the implanted right brain glioma. The data were generated using quasi-parallel microbeams at the biomedical beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble France. This means we can directly compare abscopal and ""true"" bystander effects in a rodent tumour model. Analysis of right brain hemisphere, left brain and urinary bladder in the directly irradiated animals and their unirradiated partners strongly suggests that bystander effects (in partner animals) are not the same as abscopal effects (in the irradiated animal). Furthermore, the presence of a tumour in the right brain alters the magnitude of both abscopal and bystander effects in the tissues from the directly irradiated animal and in the unirradiated partners which did not contain tumours, meaning the type of signal was different.",Included
994,"Nonvisual light responses in the Rpe65 knockout mouse: rod loss restores sensitivity to the melanopsin system Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4), together with rods and cones, provide light information driving nonvisual light responses. We examined nonvisual photoreception in mice lacking RPE65, a protein that is required for regeneration of visual chromophore in rods and cones. Although Rpe65 knockouts retain a small degree of rod function, we show here that circadian phase shifting responses in Rpe65(-/-) mice are attenuated far beyond what has been reported for rodless/coneless mice. Furthermore, the number of melanopsin-immunoreactive perikarya and the extent of dendritic arborizations were decreased in Rpe65 knockout mice compared with controls. To assess the nature of the photoreceptive defect in Rpe65 null mice, we eliminated either rods or melanopsin from Rpe65(-/-) retinas by generating (i) Rpe65(-/-) mice carrying a transgene (rdta) that results in selective elimination of rods and (ii) double knockout Rpe65(-/-);Opn4(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, rod loss in Rpe65 knockout mice resulted in restoration of circadian photosensitivity. Normal photoentrainment was lost in Rpe65(-/-);Opn4(-/-) mice, and, instead, a diurnal phenotype was observed. Our findings demonstrate that RPE65 is not required for ipRGC function but reveal the existence of a mechanism whereby rods may influence the function of ipRGCs.",Excluded
64,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for pituitary spindle cell oncocytomas OBJECTIVES: Spindle cell oncocytomas (SCOs) are benign lesions of the posterior portion of the pituitary gland that typically come to neurosurgical attention due to compression of the sellar or parasellar structures, and headaches. Initial treatment options for SCOs include surgical resection, particularly via the transsphenoidal approach. However, given that initial resection tends to be insufficient and subsequent revision surgery carries high complication risk, adjuvant treatment modalities may appear to offer promising solutions for controlling tumor progression. This report focuses on a potential new therapeutic option for SCOs, gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors identified all patients at one center who had a pituitary lesion treated with GKRS between 2005 and 2016. Five patients with histopathologically confirmed SCO who underwent GKRS were retrospectively identified and included in the present study RESULTS: The mean patient age was 52 years (range, 41-61 years). The most common presenting symptom was visual disturbance. All five patients had a history of transsphenoidal surgical resection prior to GKRS therapy. The mean tumor volume was 2.25 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 0.7-5.38 cm<sup>3</sup>). The median tumor margin dose was 12 Gy (range, 12-14 Gy), and the median maximal dose was 24 Gy (range, 24-35 Gy). The median isodose was 50 (range, 40-50). No tumor volume progression was observed during radiological follow-up after GKRS (mean, 52 months; range, 36-84 months). At last follow-up, no neurological, endocrinological, or visual complications had been observed.CONCLUSION: Given their highly vascular and adherent nature, SCOs can be challenging tumors to treat, in particular when they recur. In our five cases, GKRS provided excellent tumor volume control for approximately 4.3 years on average. These results suggest that GKRS is a safe and effective treatment modality for histopathologically confirmed residual SCO.",Excluded

Kinematic, dynamic and electromyographic analysis was performed before and while subjects were starting gait in response to an external cue. Effects of STN stimulation on the standing posture preceding the go signal included significant improvement of the vertical alignment of the trunk and shank, decrease of the hip joint moment, backward shift of the center of pressure (CoP) and reduction of abnormal tonic and/or rhythmic activity in the thigh and leg muscles. Responses to bilateral STN stimulation were more consistent than those evoked by unilateral stimulation. Moreover, comparison between postural changes induced by STN stimulation applied prior to the gait initiation cue and during simple quiet standing revealed more significant responses in the former condition. Effects on the actual gait initiation process included shortening of the imbalance phase, larger backward/lateral displacement of CoP and more physiological expression of the underlying anticipatory muscular synergy. Additional changes were shortening of the unloading phase, shortening of the first-swing phase and increase in the length of the first step. Results demonstrate substantial influence of STN stimulation on functionally basic motor control mechanisms. In particular, the evidence of more significant responses upon attention-demanding conditions and the remarkable effects on postural programmes sub-serving feed-forward regulation of the onset of complex multijoint movements, suggests a consistent action on postural sub-systems relying on cognitive data processing and internal models of body mechanics.",Excluded
612,"Evaluation of Peritumoral Edema in the Delineation of Radiotherapy Clinical Target Volumes for Glioblastoma Purpose: To evaluate the spatial relationship between peritumoral edema and recurrence pattern in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods and Materials: Forty-eight primary GBM patients received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy that did not intentionally include peritumoral edema within the clinical target volume between July 2000 and June 2001. All 48 patients have subsequently recurred, and their original treatment planning parameters were used for this study. New theoretical radiation treatment plans were created for the same 48 patients, based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) target delineation guidelines that specify inclusion of peritumoral edema. Target volume and recurrent tumor coverage, as well as percent volume of normal brain irradiated, were assessed for both methods of target delineation using dose-volume histograms. Result(s): A comparison between the location of recurrent tumor and peritumoral edema volumes from all 48 cases failed to show correlation by linear regression modeling (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.0007; p = 0.3). For patients with edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, the percent volume of brain irradiated to 46 Gy was significantly greater in treatment plans that intentionally included peritumoral edema compared with those that did not (38% vs. 31%; p = 0.003).

Conclusion(s): Clinical target volume delineation based on a 2-cm margin rather than on peritumoral edema did not seem to alter the central pattern of failure for patients with GBM. For patients with peritumoral edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, using a constant 2-cm margin resulted in a smaller median percent volume of brain being irradiated to 30 Gy, 46 Gy, and 50 Gy compared with corresponding theoretical RTOG plans that deliberately included peritumoral edema. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

977,"Cardiovascular responses to heat stress and their adverse consequences in healthy and vulnerable human populations This paper reviews the basic thermoregulatory physiology of healthy people in relation to hazards from external heat stress and internal heat loads generated by physical exercise or radiofrequency (RF) radiation. In addition, members of the population are identified who may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of heat stress. These data are examined in relation to current international guidance on occupational and public exposure to RF radiation. When body temperature rises, heat balance of the body is normally restored by increased blood flow to the skin and by sweating. These responses increase the work of the heart and cause loss of salt and water from the body. They impair working efficiency and can overload the heart and cause haemoconcentration, which can lead to coronary and cerebral thrombosis, particularly in elderly people with atheromatous arteries. These adverse effects of thermoregulatory adjustments occur with even mild heat loads and account for the great majority of heat-related illness and death. They are, therefore, particularly relevant to determination of safe population exposures to additional sources of heat stress. It is concluded that exposure to RF levels currently recommended as safe for the general population, equivalent to heat loads of about one tenth basal metabolic rate, could continue to be regarded as trivial in this context, but that prolonged exposures of the general population to RF levels higher than that could not be regarded as safe in all circumstances.",Excluded
261,"Distinct response of adult neural stem cells to low versus high dose ionising radiation Radiosusceptibility is the sensitivity of a biological organism to ionising radiation (IR)-induced carcinogenesis, an outcome of IR exposure relevant following low doses. The tissue response is strongly influenced by the DNA damage response (DDR) activated in stem and progenitor cells. We previously reported that in vivo exposure to 2 Gy X-rays activates apoptosis, proliferation arrest and premature differentiation in neural progenitor cells (transit amplifying cells and neuroblasts) but not in neural stem cells (NSCs) of the largest neurogenic region of the adult brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ). These responses promote adult quiescent NSC (qNSC) activation after 2 Gy. In contrast, neonatal (P5) SVZ neural progenitors continue proliferating and do not activate qNSCs. Significantly, the human and mouse neonatal brain is radiosusceptible. Here, we examine the response of stem and progenitor cells in the SVZ to low IR doses (50-500 mGy). We observe a linear dose-response for apoptosis but, in contrast, proliferation arrest and neuroblast differentiation require a threshold dose of 200 or 500 mGy, respectively. Importantly, qNSCs were not activated at doses below 500 mGy. Thus, full DDR activation in the neural stem cell compartment in vivo necessitates a threshold dose, which can be considered of significance when evaluating IR-induced cancer risk and dose extrapolation.",Included

Increasing evidence suggests that PMC neurotransmitter receptors are involved in modulating immune responses. It is also thought that expression of PMC neurotransmitter receptors may reflect the status of homologous brain receptors. A problem encountered with assay of PMC neurotransmitter receptors was in developing techniques suitable for their assessment in spite of low density. In this paper we summarized findings on the expression of alpha1-adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor subtypes in human peripheral blood lymphocytes characterized by radioligand binding assay techniques and immunocytochemistry. Human lymphocytes express alpha1A-, alpha1B- and alpha1D-adrenoceptor subtypes and dopamine D3, D4 and D5 receptors. Compared to radioligand binding assay, immunocytochemistry applied to cytospin-centrifuged peripheral lymphocytes allowed to assay receptor subtypes investigated in small amounts of blood. The development of sensitive and reproducible techniques for assaying PMC neurotransmitter receptor subtypes even in small amounts of blood such as those used for diagnostic purposes may allow to analyze their sensitivity to different conditions including radiation exposure.",Excluded
684,"Low dose fractionated radiotherapy and temozolomiDe in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: Preliminary results of a pilot study Purpose: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the brain tumor with the worst prognosis, especially for patients with gross residual tumor after surgery (RPA classes V and VI). In vitro studies demonstrated the hyper-radiosensitivity of human malignant glioma cell lines to low radiation doses, moreover preclinical studies hypothesized a synergism between low doses fractionated radiotherapy (LD-FRT) and chemotherapy. Therefore we planned a pilot study to define the feasibility and the efficacy of this approach in na GBM RPA classes V-VI. Materials: Patients enrolled in the study had the following characteristics: histological diagnosis of GBM, based on minimal surgical resection or biopsy; age 18-80 years; RPA classes V-VI; estimated survival 3 months; normal haematological, renal, hepatic, cardiac and respiratory functions. Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was defined as the surgical bed with gross residual contrast-enhancing tissue on magnetic resonance imaging. The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) was defined as the GTV with a 30 mm margin to incluDe any potential subclinical tumor. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) was defined as CTV + 5 mm, due to set-up uncertainties. Hypofractionated 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) was delivered on GTV (total dose: 30 Gy in fractions of 3 Gy/day) with concomitant and adjuvant (1 cycle) temozolomiDe (TMZ). From second to fifth cycle of adjuvant TMZ (200 mg/m2), if neither progression disease was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, nor unacceptable toxicities were recorded, LD-FRT was associated (2 daily fractions of 0.40 Gy, over 5 days, q 28). Primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of toxicity and safety of this schedula (RTOG criteria). Clinical response (RECIST criteria), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also evaluated. Result(s): From June 2008 to October 2010 15 patients with a newly diagnosis of GBM were enrolled in this study. Eight patients underwent incomplete surgical resection and 7 patients received only biopsy. The median total dose of LD-FRT delivered was 1040 cGy (range 320 1920). Up to this date 11 patients are evaluable. GraDe 12 haematological toxicity was observed in 18 % of patients, graDe 34 was observed in 9 % of patients, mainly represented by leukopenia and thrombocytopenia; however no neurological acute and late toxicity were observed. No treatment related death occurred. Four patients (36%) had a partial response (PR), while 2 patients (18%) had a stable disease (SD), lasting more than 8 weeks (Clinical Benefit 54%). At a median follow-up of 9 months (range 2 22) median PFS was 5 months and median OS was 9 months, with a survival rate at 1 year of 30%. Conclusion(s): The results of the study demonstrated that LD-FRT with concurrent chemotherapy, after hypofractionated 3D-CRT plus Temozolomide, is a well tolerated treatment with a low toxicity profile. This data seem to be encouraging and suggest the prosecution of the analysis.",Excluded
1024,The postradiation effect of acetylcholine and GABA on the active potassium uptake by slices of rat cerebral cortex. [Russian] Whole-body X irradiation (0.155 and 0.310 C/kg) was shown to modify the biphase effect of acetylcholine and GABA on antigradient K+ uptake by rat brain sections. Radiation made the effects of neuromediators on active K+ transport be differently directed: acetylcholine enhanced the inhibitory effect of radiation and GABA restored the Na-K-pump function.,Included

630,"The role of the mammalian DNA end-processing enzyme polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 pathogenesis DNA strand-breaks (SBs) with non-ligatable ends are generated by ionizing radiation, oxidative stress, various chemotherapeutic agents, and also as base excision repair (BER) intermediates. Several neurological diseases have already been identified as being due to a deficiency in DNA end-processing activities. Two common dirty ends, 3'-P and 5'-OH, are processed by mammalian polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a bifunctional enzyme with 3'-phosphatase and 5'-kinase activities. We have made the unexpected observation that PNKP stably associates with Ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a polyglutamine repeat-containing protein mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD). This disease is one of the most common dominantly inherited ataxias worldwide; the defect in SCA3 is due to CAG repeat expansion (from the normal 14-41 to 55-82 repeats) in the ATXN3 coding region. However, how the expanded form gains its toxic function is still not clearly understood. Here we report that purified wild-type (WT) ATXN3 stimulates, and by contrast the mutant form specifically inhibits, PNKP's 3' phosphatase activity in vitro. ATXN3-deficient cells also show decreased PNKP activity. Furthermore, transgenic mice conditionally expressing the pathological form of human ATXN3 also showed decreased 3'-phosphatase activity of PNKP, mostly in the deep cerebellar nuclei, one of the most affected regions in MJD patients' brain. Finally, long amplicon quantitative PCR analysis of human MJD patients' brain samples showed a significant accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Our results thus indicate that the accumulation of DNA strand breaks due to functional deficiency of PNKP is etiologically linked to the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD.",Excluded
