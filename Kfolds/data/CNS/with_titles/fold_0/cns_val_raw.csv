275,"Desensitization and Recovery of Crayfish Photoreceptors Upon Delivery of a Light Stimulus. A method to study desensitization and recovery of crayfish photoreceptors is presented. We performed intracellular electrical recordings of photoreceptor cells in isolated eyestalks using the discontinuous single electrode-switched voltage-clamp configuration. First, with a razor blade we made an opening in the dorsal cornea to get access to the retina. Thereafter, we inserted a glass electrode through the opening, and penetrated a cell as reported by the recording of a negative potential. Membrane potential was clamped at the photoreceptor's resting potential and a light-pulse was applied to activate currents. Finally, the two light-flash protocol was employed to measure current desensitization and recovery. The first light-flash triggers, after a lag period, the transduction ionic current, which after reaching a peak amplitude decays towards a desensitized state; the second flash, applied at varying time intervals, assesses the state of the light-activated conductance. To characterize the light-elicited current, three parameters were measured: 1) latency (the time elapsed between light flash delivery and the moment in which current achieves 10% of its maximum value); 2) peak current; and 3) desensitization time constant (exponential time constant of the current decay phase). All parameters are affected by the first pulse. To quantify recovery from desensitization, the ratio p2/p1 was employed versus time between pulses. p1 is the peak current evoked by the first light-pulse, and p2 is the peak current evoked by the second pulse. These data were fitted to a sum of exponential functions. Finally, these measurements were carried out as function of circadian time.",Excluded

793,"Microstructural changes in white matter associated with alcohol use in early phase psychosis: A diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and relaxometry study. Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that brain white matter (WM) abnormalities may be central to the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. Additionally, cannabis use and alcohol use are each associated with WM abnormalities, however there is limited data on these substances effects on WM microstructure in psychosis, especially early phase psychosis (EPP). This study examined the impact of cannabis use and alcohol use in WM in EPP (N=21) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transverse relaxation time of tissue water (T2), with the primary outcomes being mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and T2. Method(s): Analyses were performed at the full brain level using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis as well as within a predefined WM region of interest (ROI) implicated in psychosis (containing the left superior longitudinal fasciculus). Result(s): Our findings revealed that younger age of onset of regular alcohol use (greater than one drink per week) was associated with lower FA values in the left thalamic radiation, left parahippocampal and left amygdalar WM. Also, more frequent lifetime cannabis use was correlated with increased mean full brain FA, although this finding did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. There was no significant relationship found between FA and alcohol or cannabis use within the ROI. Relaxometry analysis revealed trend level evidence of shortened T2 with more frequent cannabis use. Conclusion(s): This study provides novel data demonstrating cortical and subcortical WM changes related to alcohol use in EPP and is the first to combine DTI and relaxometry as it relates to this patient population.",Excluded
852,"Beyond palliative radiotherapy: A pilot multidisciplinary brain metastases clinic. Purpose The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a multidisciplinary palliative radiotherapy clinic for patients with brain metastases. Methods We designed a 6-month pilot Rapid Access Palliative Radiotherapy Program (RAPRP) brain metastases clinic. The main goals of the clinic were: (1) to provide timely consultation and treatment, (2) to provide multidisciplinary assessment and care, (3) to facilitate accrual of patients to research studies, and (4) to be a positive experience for patients. Team members included a radiation oncologist, radiation therapist, nurse practitioner, social worker (SW), occupational therapist (OT), and registered dietitian (RD). Patients underwent multidimensional assessment with patient-reported questionnaires and completed a patient satisfaction survey. Data were collected in a prospective database and collated in a standardized fashion with descriptive statistics recorded as percentages, medians, and ranges. Results The pilot brain metastases clinic ran weekly from August 5, 2009 to January 27, 2010. In total, 33 patients were seen. The median time from referral date to clinic date was 6 days, with 76% of patients seen within 1 week. Most patients (94%) started their radiotherapy on clinic day. Fifteen patients (45%) required assessment by a SW, 36% by an OT, and 33% by a RD. Ninety-one percent of patients participated in a research study. Eighty-six percent of patients reported being very satisfied with the clinic experience, and 97% would recommend the clinic to a patient in a similar situation. Conclusions The pilot RAPRP Brain Metastases Clinic was successful in providing patients with timely and multidisciplinary care and will continue beyond the pilot phase. © Springer-Verlag 2011.",Excluded
994,"Nonvisual light responses in the Rpe65 knockout mouse: rod loss restores sensitivity to the melanopsin system. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4), together with rods and cones, provide light information driving nonvisual light responses. We examined nonvisual photoreception in mice lacking RPE65, a protein that is required for regeneration of visual chromophore in rods and cones. Although Rpe65 knockouts retain a small degree of rod function, we show here that circadian phase shifting responses in Rpe65(-/-) mice are attenuated far beyond what has been reported for rodless/coneless mice. Furthermore, the number of melanopsin-immunoreactive perikarya and the extent of dendritic arborizations were decreased in Rpe65 knockout mice compared with controls. To assess the nature of the photoreceptive defect in Rpe65 null mice, we eliminated either rods or melanopsin from Rpe65(-/-) retinas by generating (i) Rpe65(-/-) mice carrying a transgene (rdta) that results in selective elimination of rods and (ii) double knockout Rpe65(-/-);Opn4(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, rod loss in Rpe65 knockout mice resulted in restoration of circadian photosensitivity. Normal photoentrainment was lost in Rpe65(-/-);Opn4(-/-) mice, and, instead, a diurnal phenotype was observed. Our findings demonstrate that RPE65 is not required for ipRGC function but reveal the existence of a mechanism whereby rods may influence the function of ipRGCs.",Excluded
493,"Molecular architecture of a complex between an adhesion protein from the malaria parasite and intracellular adhesion molecule 1. The adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to human tissues or endothelium is central to the pathology caused by the parasite during malaria. It contributes to the avoidance of parasite clearance by the spleen and to the specific pathologies of cerebral and placental malaria. The PfEMP1 family of adhesive proteins is responsible for this sequestration by mediating interactions with diverse human ligands. In addition, as the primary targets of acquired, protective immunity, the PfEMP1s are potential vaccine candidates. PfEMP1s contain large extracellular ectodomains made from CIDR (cysteine-rich interdomain regions) and DBL (Duffy-binding-like) domains and show extensive variation in sequence, size, and domain organization. Here we use biophysical methods to characterize the entire ~300-kDa ectodomain from IT4VAR13, a protein that interacts with the host receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). We show through small angle x-ray scattering that IT4VAR13 is rigid, elongated, and monomeric. We also show that it interacts with ICAM-1 through the DBLbeta domain alone, forming a 1:1 complex. These studies provide a first low resolution structural view of a PfEMP1 ectodomain in complex with its ligand. They show that it combines a modular domain arrangement consisting of individual ligand binding domains, with a defined higher order architecture that exposes the ICAM-1 binding surface to allow adhesion.",Excluded
246,"Palliative radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. The palliative treatment of patients with NSCLC should be individualized. Treatment decisions should be directed by the goal of maximizing the patient's quality of life, and the patient's wishes should always be ascertained. The approaches to palliative radiation treatment of the chest, bones, and brain are quite similar. Treatment of the chest and bones is usually reserved until symptoms are significant. Brain metastases are generally treated soon after diagnosis. With respect to dose- fractionation schedules, the data are not conclusive. In theory, more protracted schedules of 40 to 50 Gy in 4 to 5 weeks are associated with more durable responses and less long-term morbidity than are shorter and lower- dose schedules. These regimens are therefore worth considering for the most favorable subset of palliative patients (ie, those with good performance status and low burden of disease). At the other end of the spectrum, very ill patients with poor performance status may be best served by short hypofractionated schedules such as 20 Gy in five fractions, 17 Gy in two fractions, or possibly 8 to 10 Gy in one fraction. Response rates with these regimens are good, trips to the treatment facility are minimized, and these ill patients will probably not live long enough to experience the higher long-term toxicity rates associated with larger treatment fractions. The majority of patients, however, fall between these two extremes and are well served by schedules such as 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Radiation treatment fields should not be excessive but cover gross disease with a limited margin. (In the setting of brain metastases, treatment of the whole brain is recommended.) Further study of palliative treatment approaches should focus not only on assessments of response and toxicity but also on the impact of different treatments on overall quality of life.",Excluded

The postoperative use of lomustin, a nitrosourea agent, was investigated for its impact on the efficiency of hyperfractionated radiation therapy performed in patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma of the brain. A total of 35 patients (26 and 9 patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma, respectively) were followed up. Radiation therapy was performed, by using a total focal dose of 65 Gy in 2 steps or a single dose of 1.25 Gy twice daily every 4-6 hours. The patients received lomustin in a single oral dose of 160-200 mg at each of 2 stages of a hyperfractionated course of radiation therapy. The interval between two successive administrations was 5 weeks. Lomustin in combination with hyperfractionated radiation therapy was found to have no effect on the survival of patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma.",Excluded
412,"Light-induced modulation of coupling between AII amacrine cells in the rabbit retina. The rod-driven, AII amacrine cells in the mammalian retina maintain homologous gap junctions with one another as well as heterologous gap junctions with on-cone bipolar cells. We used background illumination to study whether changes in the adaptational state of the retina affected the permeabilities of these two sets of gap junctions. To access changes in permeability, we injected single AII amacrine cells with the biotinylated tracer, Neurobiotin, and measured the extent of tracer coupling to neighboring AII cells and neighboring cone bipolar cells. We also measured the center-receptive field size of AII cells to assess concomitant changes in electrical coupling. Our results indicate that in well dark-adapted retinas, AII cells form relatively small networks averaging 20 amacrine cells and covering about 75 microns. The size of these networks matched closely to the size of AII cell on-center receptive fields. However, over most of their operating range, AII cells formed dramatically larger networks, averaging 326 amacrine cells, which corresponded to an increased receptive-field size. As the retina was light adapted beyond the operating range of the AII cells, they uncoupled to form networks comparable in size to those seem in well dark-adapted retinas. Our results, then, indicate that the adaptational state of the retina has a profound effect on the extent of electrical coupling between AII amacrine cells. Although we observed light-induced changes in the number of tracer-coupled cone bipolar cells, these appeared to be an epiphenomenon of changes in homologous coupling between AII amacrine cells. Therefore, in contrast to the robust changes in AII-AII coupling produced by background illumination, our data provided no evidence of a light-induced modulation of coupling between AII cells and on-cone bipolar cells.",Excluded
916,"Ionizing radiation induces structural and functional damage on the molecules of rat brain homogenate membranes: a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic study. Humans can be exposed to ionizing radiation, due to various reasons, whose structural effects on biological membranes are not well defined. The current study aims to understand the ionizing radiation-induced structural and functional alterations in biomolecules of brain membranes using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy using rat animal models. For this purpose, 1000 cGy of ionizing radiation was specifically directed to the head of Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were decapitated after 24 h. The results revealed that the lipid-to-protein ratio decreased and that irradiation caused lipid peroxidation and increases in the amounts of olefinic =CH, carbonyl, and methylene groups of lipids. In addition, ionizing radiation induced a decrease in membrane fluidity, disordering of membrane lipids, strengthening of the hydrogen bonding of the phosphate groups of lipid head-groups, and weakening in the hydrogen bonding of the interfacial carbonyl groups of lipids. Radiation further caused significant decrements in the alpha-helix and turns, and significant increments in the beta-sheet and random coil contents in the protein structure. Hierarchical cluster analyses, performed in the whole region (3030-1000 cm(-1)), lipid (3030-2800 cm(-1)), and protein (1700-1600 cm(-1)) regions separately, successfully differentiated the control and irradiated groups of rat brain membranes and showed that proteins in the membranes are affected more than lipids from the damages induced with ionizing radiation. As a result, the current study showed that FT-IR spectroscopy can be used successfully as a novel method to monitor radiation-induced alterations on biological membranes.",Included
426,"An atypical presentation of a salivary gland tumour: A case report. Adenoid Cystic Salivary Gland malignancies are uncommon, accounting for approximately 8.4 % of salivary gland tumours. The majority are benign, normally presenting as a slowly growing mass, with the parotid gland being the most commonly affected. We present a case report of a 74-year-oldwoman originally referred to neurology with a 5 month history of pain on the right side of her chin, associated with a sensation of sunburn and a 'feeling of a clumsy tongue'. She had no history of radiation exposure and did not smoke. On examination she was found to have numbness on the right side of her chin, with associated right sided tongue deviation and right-sided tongue wasting and numbness. She was initially investigated for an underlying neurological cause. Her MRI demonstrated an abnormality affecting the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. A subsequent CT Neck and Ultrasound demonstrated a lesion within the right sublingual space, which was biopsied and shown to be an adenoid cystic carcinoma. A radical resection of the lesion was performed, resecting from the floor of mouth and base of tongue, with a right-sided selective neck dissection, approached via mandibulotomy. The procedure also involved the formation of a tracheostomy and reconstruction with a free radial forearm flap to the floor of her mouth. The patient also received adjuvant radiotherapy, an additional intervention shown to increase the 5-year survival in advanced disease. This case demonstrates an abnormal presentation of a salivary gland tumour in a less commonly involved gland, and discusses the impact of surgical intervention in the management of invasive salivary gland malignancies.",Excluded
612,"Evaluation of Peritumoral Edema in the Delineation of Radiotherapy Clinical Target Volumes for Glioblastoma. Purpose: To evaluate the spatial relationship between peritumoral edema and recurrence pattern in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods and Materials: Forty-eight primary GBM patients received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy that did not intentionally include peritumoral edema within the clinical target volume between July 2000 and June 2001. All 48 patients have subsequently recurred, and their original treatment planning parameters were used for this study. New theoretical radiation treatment plans were created for the same 48 patients, based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) target delineation guidelines that specify inclusion of peritumoral edema. Target volume and recurrent tumor coverage, as well as percent volume of normal brain irradiated, were assessed for both methods of target delineation using dose-volume histograms. Result(s): A comparison between the location of recurrent tumor and peritumoral edema volumes from all 48 cases failed to show correlation by linear regression modeling (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.0007; p = 0.3). For patients with edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, the percent volume of brain irradiated to 46 Gy was significantly greater in treatment plans that intentionally included peritumoral edema compared with those that did not (38% vs. 31%; p = 0.003). The pattern of failure was identical between the two sets of plans (40 central, 3 in-field, 3 marginal, and 2 distant recurrence). Conclusion(s): Clinical target volume delineation based on a 2-cm margin rather than on peritumoral edema did not seem to alter the central pattern of failure for patients with GBM. For patients with peritumoral edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, using a constant 2-cm margin resulted in a smaller median percent volume of brain being irradiated to 30 Gy, 46 Gy, and 50 Gy compared with corresponding theoretical RTOG plans that deliberately included peritumoral edema. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

579,"Cyclic GMP releases calcium from disc membranes of vertebrate photoreceptors. Physiological concentrations of cyclic guanosine 3',6'-monophosphate (cGMP) inhibit 45Ca uptake and increase 45Ca release from vertebrate photoreceptor rod outer segment disc membranes. These effects are specific for cGMP. Several facts, including the independence of these effects from added triphosphates, suggest that cGMP diminishes the Ca-binding capacity of the disc membranes. Preliminary data show that the apparent affinity constant of the cGMP-dependent Ca-binding sites of the disc membranes is of the same (or even higher) order of magnitude as that of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. As expected, the observed cGMP effects are not dependent on the light or dark conditions of the disc membranes.",Excluded
456,"Zero echo time MRI-only treatment planning for radiation therapy of brain tumors after resection. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the sole imaging modality for patient modeling in radiation therapy (RT) is a challenging task due to the need to derive electron density information from MRI and construct a so-called pseudo-computed tomography (pCT) image. We have previously published a new method to derive pCT images from head T1-weighted (T1-w) MR images using a single-atlas propagation scheme followed by a post hoc correction of the mapped CT numbers using local intensity information. The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of our method with head zero echo time (ZTE) MR images. To evaluate results, the mean absolute error in bins of 20 HU was calculated with respect to the true planning CT scan of the patient. We demonstrated that applying our method using ZTE MR images instead of T1-w improved the correctness of the pCT in case of bone resection surgery prior to RT (that is, an example of large anatomical difference between the atlas and the patient).",Excluded
952,"Brain metastases with poor vascular function are susceptible to pseudoprogression after stereotactic radiation surgery. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the hemodynamic status of cerebral metastases prior to and after stereotactic radiation surgery (SRS) and to identify the vascular characteristics that are associated with the development of pseudoprogression from radiation-induced damage with and without a radionecrotic component. Methods and materials: Twenty-four patients with 29 metastases from non-small cell lung cancer or malignant melanoma received SRS with dose of 15 Gy to 25 Gy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired prior to SRS, every 3 months during the first year after SRS, and every 6 months thereafter. On the basis of the follow-up MRI scans or histology after SRS, metastases were classified as having response, tumor progression, or pseudoprogression. Advanced perfusion MRI enabled the estimation of vascular status in tumor regions including fractions of abnormal vessel architecture, underperfused tissue, and vessel pruning. Result(s): Prior to SRS, metastases that later developed pseudoprogression had a distinct poor vascular function in the peritumoral zone compared with responding metastases (P <.05; number of metastases = 15). In addition, differences were found between the peritumoral zone of pseudoprogressing metastases and normal-appearing brain tissue (P <.05). In contrast, for responding metastases, no differences in vascular status between peritumoral and normal-appearing brain tissue were observed. The dysfunctional peritumoral vasculature persisted in pseudoprogressing metastases after SRS. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that the vascular status of peritumoral tissue prior to SRS plays a defining role in the development of pseudoprogression and that advanced perfusion MRI may provide new insights into patients' susceptibility to radiation-induced effects.

422,"The effect of radioprotective compounds on brain serotonine metabolism of irradiated experimental animals. The authors examined the quantitative changes in the brain of neurotransmitter material, serotonin (SE) and its metabolite = 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) on the effect of a lethal dose of ionizing radiation and that of AET and liponic acid. It was concluded that following 9.0 Gy <sup>60</sup>Co-gamma irradiation, the serotonin amount significantly decreased in the brain after 1 hr of irradiation, while this amount increased in metabolite which might in our supposition be the result of the metabolising enzyme - the monoaminoxidase activity increase. On the effect of AET given in radioprotective dose-rate, serotonin increased and the amount of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid decreased in the brain. Similar changes to AET were observed following the adding of liponic acid.

957,"Hemorrhage of cerebral arteriovenous malformations significantly alters stereotactic radiosurgery outcomes. Introduction: Intracranial hemorrhage is simultaneously the most frequent and most debilitating manifestation of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM), but its impact on success and complications of radiosurgery has not been rigorously assessed. In this case-control study, we define the effect of prior hemorrhage on AVM radiosurgery outcomes. Method(s): From a prospective, institutional database of 1400 AVM patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, unruptured and ruptured AVMs were matched in a 1:1 fashion, blinded to outcome, based on patient demographics, prior embolization, AVM size (mean volume of unruptured AVMs 3.7 cm3 versus ruptured AVMs 3.5 cm3, P=0.195), Spetzler-Martin grade and radiosurgical treatment parameters (mean prescription dose for unruptured AVMs 20.9 Gy versus ruptured AVMs 21.0 Gy, P=0.837). There were 270 patients in each cohort. Matched statistical analyses were used to compare the baseline characteristics, obliteration rates, post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage risks, and incidences of radiation-induced changes (RIC) between the two cohorts. Result(s): The actuarial obliteration rates of the two cohorts were similar (unruptured AVMs: 38%, 58%, 76% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 40%, 60%, 73% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.592). However, for embolized AVMs, complete obliteration was more likely to be achieved in unruptured lesions (unruptured AVMs: 25%, 32%, 54% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 18%, 27%, 42% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.038). Prior AVM rupture resulted in a higher annual risk of post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage (ruptured AVMs 2.3% versus unruptured AVMs 1.1%, P=0.025) but a lower rate of cumulative and symptomatic RIC (cumulative RIC: ruptured AVMs 30.4% versus unruptured AVMs 48.9%, P<0.0001; symptomatic RIC: ruptured AVMs 7.0% versus unruptured AVMs 12.2%, P=0.041, respectively). The rates of permanent RIC were similar between the unruptured (2.2%) and ruptured (1.9%) AVM cohorts (P=0.761). Conclusion(s): Prior AVM rupture significantly alters the risk of latency period hemorrhage and RIC following radiosurgery. These effects should be taken into consideration with the multidisciplinary management of AVM patients.",Excluded

Mechanical and computer advances in linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery apply precise single/fractional stereotactic radiation to multiple pathologies. During a 10-year span the senior author used proton-beam radiosurgery in over 300 lesions, followed by gamma-knife, adapted and dedicated LINACS, including cyber-knife, in another 700 patients. The last 10 years, experience was accumulated with the Novalis in over 3,000 patients. Novalis uses a beam-shaper in a high-speed delivery LINAC. It operates using conventional circular arc, conformai static beam, dynamic conformai or intensity modulated modes. Patients treated with Novalis at the UCLA since 1997 were evaluated regarding effectiveness, complications and failure. These results were compared with previous 1997 data. Over 4,000 patients with trigeminal neuralgia/intractable pain, arteriovenous malformations/angiomas, metastases, ependymomas, gliomas, meningiomas hemangiopericytomas, schwannomas, adenomas, hemangioblastomas, and chordoma were treated. Spinal lesions were treated with frameless stereotaxis and on-line precision checks. Treatment was expeditious, comfortable and with reduced complications. Success is similar or superior to published data. Reduced treatment time of complex lesions and highly homogeneous dose compares favorably to other radiosurgery. The senior author's experience validates the novel shaped-beam approach. Long-term follow-up supports safety and effectiveness and capability to treat brain and spine. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
444,"Solar ultraviolet-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality in the United States, 1993-2002. BACKGROUND: An inverse relationship between solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) exposure and non-skin cancer mortality has long been reported. Vitamin D, acquired primarily through exposure to the sun via the skin, is believed to inhibit tumor development and growth and reduce mortality for certain cancers.METHODS: We extend the analysis of this relationship to include cancer incidence as well as mortality, using higher quality and higher resolution data sets than have typically been available. Over three million incident cancer cases between 1998 and 2002 and three million cancer deaths between 1993 and 2002 in the continental United States were regressed against daily satellite-measured solar UV-B levels, adjusting for numerous confounders. Relative risks of reduced solar UV-B exposure were calculated for thirty-two different cancer sites.RESULTS: For non-Hispanic whites, an inverse relationship between solar UV-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality was observed for ten sites: bladder, colon, Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, other biliary, prostate, rectum, stomach, uterus, and vulva. Weaker evidence of an inverse relationship was observed for six sites: breast, kidney, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreas, and small intestine. For three sites, inverse relationships were seen that varied markedly by sex: esophagus (stronger in males than females), gallbladder (stronger in females than males), and thyroid (only seen in females). No association was found for bone and joint, brain, larynx, liver, nasal cavity, ovary, soft tissue, male thyroid, and miscellaneous cancers. A positive association between solar UV-B exposure and cancer mortality and incidence was found for anus, cervix, oral cavity, melanoma, and other non-epithelial skin cancer.CONCLUSION: This paper adds to the mounting evidence for the influential role of solar UV-B exposure on cancer, particularly for some of the less-well studied digestive cancers. The relative risks for cancer incidence are similar to those for cancer mortality for most sites. For several sites (breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, other biliary, vulva), the relative risks of mortality are higher, possibly suggesting that the maintenance of adequate vitamin D levels is more critical for limiting tumor progression than for preventing tumor onset. Our findings are generally consistent with the published literature, and include three cancer sites not previously linked with solar UV-B exposure, to our knowledge: leukemia, small intestine, and vulva.",Excluded

Objective: In this study, we compared the effects of combination of celecoxib, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and hippocampal sparing, IMRT with hippocampal sparing and IMRT only on cognitive function, life quality and therapeutic effects in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): From June 2015 to December 2016, 177 cases with NPC in our hospital were finally enrolled and randomly divided into three groups: IMRT only group (I group), hippocampal sparing IMRT (H group) and celecoxib combined with hippocampal sparing IMRT group (Ce group). Cognitive function and life quality were evaluated three months after treatment via Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ C30) respectively. Indicators for therapeutic effects including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), adverse reactions, recurrence and metastasis of tumor and serum tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of patients were also compared. Result(s): Before the intervention, there was no difference in cognitive function score among all the patients (P=0.876). After the treatment, no significant difference was found for RR among groups (P=0.245), however, patients in the Ce group showed the highest cognitive function score (P<0.001); the differences in adverse reactions including dry mouth (P=0.026, Ce vs. H; P=0.000, Ce vs. I; P=0.000, H vs. I), oral mucositis (P=0.060, Ce vs. H; P=0.008, Ce vs. I; P=0.396, H vs. I), skin reaction (P=0.654, Ce vs. H; P=0.027, Ce vs. I; P=0.065, H vs. I), irradiation otitis media (P=0.097, Ce vs. H; P=0.009, Ce vs. I; P=0.051, H vs. I) had statistical significance, and their incidence rates in Ce group were lowest. Meanwhile, recurrence and metastasis were less in the Ce group although the differences were insignificant (P=0.302 and 0.638). The serum level of CEA was notably lower in Ce group (P=0.031, Ce vs. H; P=0.020, Ce vs. I; P=0.512, H vs. I). Life quality scores about cognitive function and role function of H group and Ce group were higher than that of I group while Ce group was the highest (Cognitive function: P=0.020, Ce vs. H; P=0.015, Ce vs. I and P=0.023, H vs. I; role function: P=0.039, Ce vs. H; P=0.011, Ce vs. I and P=0.031, H vs. I).

1154,"Telomerase inhibition improves tumor response to radiotherapy in a murine orthotopic model of human glioblastoma. Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive type of adult brain tumor. Most GBMs express telomerase; a high level of intra-tumoral telomerase activity (TA) is predictive of poor prognosis. Thus, telomerase inhibitors are promising options to treat GBM. These inhibitors increase the response to radiotherapy (RT), in vitro as well as in vivo. Since typical treatments for GBM include RT, our objective was to evaluate the efficiency of Imetelstat (TA inhibitor) combined with RT. Finding(s): We used a murine orthotopic model of human GBM (N = 8 to11 mice per group) and muMRI imaging to evaluate the efficacy of Imetelstat (delivered by intra-peritoneal injection) alone and combined with RT. Using a clinically established protocol, we demonstrated that Imetelstat significantly: (i) inhibited the TA in the very center of the tumor, (ii) reduced tumor volume as a proportion of TA inhibition, and (iii) increased the response to RT, in terms of tumor volume regression and survival increase. Conclusion(s): Imetelstat is currently evaluated in refractory brain tumors in young patients (without RT). Our results support its clinical evaluation combined with RT to treat GBM.

160,"Monoaminergic modulation of the Na+-activated K+ channel in Kenyon cells isolated from the mushroom body of the cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) brain. Recent studies have suggested that octopamine (OA) and dopamine (DA) play important roles in mediating the reward and punishment signals, respectively, in olfactory learning in insect. However, their target molecules and the signaling mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we showed for the first time that OA and DA modulate the Na+-activated K+ (KNa) channels in an opposite way in Kenyon cells isolated from the mushroom body of the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. Patch-clamp recordings showed that the single-channel conductance of the KNa channel was about 122 pS with high K+ in the patch pipettes. The channel was found to be activated by intracellular Na+ but less activated by Li+. K+ channel blockers TEA and quinidine reduced the open probability (Po) of this channel. Bath application of OA and DA respectively increased and decreased the Po of KNa channel currents. An increase and a decrease in Po of KNa channels were also observed by applying the membrane-permeable analogs 8-Br-cyclic-AMP and 8-Br-cGMP, respectively. Furthermore, it was revealed that cAMP-induced increase and cGMP-induced decrease in Po were attenuated by the specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 and protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor KT5823, respectively. These results indicate that the KNa channel is a target molecule for OA and DA and that cAMP/PKA and cGMP/PKG signaling pathways are also involved in the modulation of KNa channels.",Excluded

179,"Postoperative radiation for lung cancer metastatic to the brain. PURPOSE: Although resection of single brain metastases and postoperative whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) improves survival, compared with treatment using WBRT alone, the value of postoperative WBRT after resection of brain metastases is controversial. We analyzed the largest reported series of lung cancer patients with resected brain metastases to evaluate the impact of postoperative WBRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1989, 185 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) underwent resection of brain metastases. Patients who had received preoperative WBRT (23%, 42 of 185) were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into group A (no WBRT; n = 32), group B (patients received WBRT and were prognostically matched to group A; n = 32), and group C (all other WBRT patients; n = 79). Most patients received postoperative doses of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Higher doses were used in 16% of group B and 18% of group C patients.RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival rates were as follows: group A, 12%; B, 8%; C, 16%. Overall brain failures occurred in 38% of patients in group A, 47% in group B, and 42% in group C. The use of WBRT (group A v groups B plus C) had no apparent impact on survival or on overall brain failure rates. In particular, no improvement in either of these parameters could be demonstrated when group B was compared with group A. Focal failure (defined as failure within the brain adjacent to the site of the resected brain metastases) occurred as follows: group A, 34% (11 of 32); groups B plus C, 23% (25 of 111) (P = .07). WBRT significantly reduced focal failure for patients with adenocarcinoma (group A, 33% [eight of 24]; groups B plus C, 14% [11 of 79]; P = .05). Nonfocal failure (anatomically distinct from the resected metastasis) occurred in 9% of patients in group A (three of 32), 21% in groups B plus C (23 of 111) (P = .07).CONCLUSION: Long-term survival is possible when NSCLC brain metastases are resected. Postoperative WBRT as used in this series only had an impact on the focal control of brain metastases and this effect was of borderline significance. The lack of conclusive benefit supports the need for ongoing randomized trials to test the value of adjuvant postoperative WBRT. Brain failures were relatively common in all three groups of patients, which suggests that doses greater than 30 Gy need to be studied.",Included
477,"Single fraction prophylactic cranial irradiation for small cell carcinoma of the lung. The effectiveness of a single 8-Gy fraction prophylactic cranial irradiation regime was assessed in 106 patients with small-cell carcinoma of the lung. All patients had limited stage disease and received combination chemotherapy consisting of either cisplatin or carboplatin with ifosfamide, etoposide, and vincristine (VICE). Cranial irradiation was administered 48 h after the first cycle of chemotherapy and was well tolerated. Actual 2-year survival was 35% and cranial relapse occurred in 22% of those patients who achieved complete remission. This compares favourably with a cranial relapse rate of 45% incomplete remitters previously reported with the same chemotherapy regime after a minimum follow-up of 2 years where PCI was not used. Formal psychometric testing was performed retrospectively on a series of 25 long-term survivors of whom 14 were taken from this reported series. Whilst 75% of patients were impaired on at least one test with 68% performing badly in the most complex task, this was not associated with clinically detectable neurological damage and the patients did not complain of memory or concentration difficulties. In conclusion, single fraction PCI, when used with platinum based combination chemotherapy, appears to be equally effective but may be less neurotoxic than the more standard fractionated regimes.",Excluded

1074,"Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy enhances radiation-induced abscopal response in glioblastoma. Introduction: Immunotherapy for glioblastoma have been largely unsuccessful, in part, because molecular heterogeneity drives selective elimination of only a subset of tumor cells. Therefore, therapeutic success in patients will require achieving an 'abscopal effect' where following focused radiation therapy, non-targeted tumor cells are attacked by the immune system. It remains unclear how glioblastoma respond to focused radiation in terms of failure location and whether immunotherapy could amplify the immune response to tumor outside the radiation field. Method(s): We evaluated patterns of treatment failure and outcomes in glioblastoma patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; N=47). To optimize the abscopal effect, we developed a genetically-engineered mouse model of bilateral glioblastoma. Here, one side of the mouse brain has a tumor treated by focal radiation and the contralateral untreated tumor is used as a readout of abscopal therapeutic efficacy following anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. Result(s): In glioblastoma patients receiving SRS, increasing age (>60 years) as associated with more 'out of field' treatment failure (P=0.036) and poor survival (P=0.001). In mice, we find that focal radiation of one tumor combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy induced an immunological response against tumor cells outside the radiation field and enhanced survival (P<0.05). Significant macrophage and T-cell infiltration occurred in mesenchymal subtype-like tumors (N=6-8 mice per group, P <0.01). In proneural subtype-like tumors, macrophage infiltration alone was associated with 'out of field' tumor regression (N=8 mice per group, P<0.05). In-vitro, treatment of mouse macrophages with anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced significant gene expression changes and enhanced phagocytosis in an ERK-dependent fashion. All 3 commercially available human anti-PD-L1 antibodies also induced ERK signaling with varying efficacies. Conclusion(s): Focal radiation combined with anti-PD-L1 therapy induces an immunological response to un-irradiated glioblastoma. We are currently optimizing other treatment combinations that could also be readily assessed in phase I human clinical trials.",Excluded

Aiming to study how glioma cells respond to gamma-rays in terms of biological processes involved in cellular responses, we performed experiments at cellular context and gene expression analysis in U343-MG-a GBM cells irradiated with 1 Gy and collected at 6 h post-irradiation. The survival rate was approximately 61% for 1 Gy and was completely reduced at 16 Gy. By performing the microarray technique, 859 cDNA clones were analyzed.

The molecular identity and pharmacological properties of mechanically gated ion channels in sensory neurons are poorly understood. We show that FM1-43, a styryl dye used to fluorescently label cell membranes, permeates mechanosensitive ion channels in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons, resulting in blockade of three previously defined subtypes of mechanically activated currents. Blockade and dye uptake is voltage dependent and regulated by external Ca2+. The structurally related larger dye FM3-25 inhibited mechanically activated currents to a lesser degree and did not permeate the channels. In vivo, FMI-43 decreases pain sensitivity in the Randall-Selitto test and increases the withdrawal threshold from von Frey hairs, together suggesting that the channels expressed at the cell body in culture mediate mechanosensation in the intact animal. These data give further insight into the mechanosensitive ion channels expressed by somatosensory neurons and suggest FM dyes are an interesting tool for studying them.",Excluded

We investigated the effects produced by the exposure of human SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells to a uniform magnetic field at intensities of 2.2 mT, which is less than the recommended public exposure limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). A decrease of membrane mitochondrial potential up to 30% was measured after 24 h of exposure to SMF in SH-SY5Y cells, and this effect was associated with reactive oxygen species production increase. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that exposure to a static magnetic intensity around 2.2 mT changed the secondary structure of cellular proteins and lipid components. The vibration bands relative to the methylene group increased significantly after 4 h of exposure, whereas further exposure up to 24 h produced evident shifts of amide I and II modes and a relative increase in beta-sheet contents with respect to alpha-helix components.

The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n- propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) has been shown to elicit dose-dependent feeding in satiated rats when injected into the midbrain raphe nuclei. Because the feeding-stimulatory effects of this compound are associated with reduced 5-HT release in forebrain, and because recent evidence suggests that medial hypothalamic norepinephrine (NE) and 5-HT may function antagonistically in the control of feeding, the present study sought to determine whether 8-OH-DPAT would enhance feeding induced by infusing NE into the medial hypothalamus. All experiments were conducted using ad libitum-fed adult male rats with two indwelling cannulas, one aimed at the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the other at either the dorsal or median raphe. In the first series of experiments rats received a fixed dose of 8- OH-DPAT (0.8 nmol) microinjected into the dorsal or median raphe, as well as NE (0, 10, 20 nmol) administered into the PVN. In the second series, rats received varying doses of raphe 8-OH-DPAT (0, 0.4, 0.8 nmol) coinjected with a single dose of PVN NE (20 nmol). Results indicated that 8-OH-DPAT and NE both elicited reliable increases in 1-h food intake, although their effects did not interact. In the final series, rats were injected with subthreshold doses of both compounds. While combined injections of 8-OH-DPAT and NE modestly increased feeding compared with saline control, this increase was not significantly greater than intake found after injection of 8-OH-DPAT or NE alone. These findings, together with other recent work, fail to support the hypothesis that deficits in brain 5-HT elicited by central administration of 8-OH-DPAT can act to enhance feeding stimulated by medial hypothalamic NE.",Excluded

Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording we demonstrate differential oxidative inhibition of voltage-gated transient (IA) and delayed rectifier [IK(V)] K+ currents by arachidonic acid (AA) and H2O2 in CA1 neurons in hippocampal slice. We show that intracellular application of 1 pm AA or its non-metabolizable analog eicosatetraynoic acid (100 pm) reduced IA by approximately 42% but did not affect IK(V). AA shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of IA by 12 mV to more negative potentials whereas the rate of inactivation was unchanged. Surprisingly, intracellular glutathione (GSH, 20 mm) enhanced the effect of AA on maximal IA (-62%) and with AA slowed inactivation of IA. The combination of GSH and extracellular ascorbate (0.4 mm) prevented reduction of IA by AA. Intracellular Trolox (a vitamin E analog, 10 microm) reduced IA by 61%and IK(V) by 39%. Like AA, intracellular Trolox caused a 10-mV left shift of IA steady-state inactivation but Trolox and AA did not cause a shift when coapplied. Extracellular Trolox (100 microm) had no effects on IA. H2O2 (80 microm) reduced both IA and IK(V) in a GSH- and ascorbate-sensitive manner and slowed the rate of inactivation of IA by a factor of 2. Coapplication of H2O2 with GSH and extracellular ascorbate caused approximately 22 mV negative shifts of both steady-state inactivation and activation. We conclude that AA is extremely potent in affecting IA by oxidative modifications.

Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumour in humans, and has a very poor prognosis. As it is a well known fact that environmental factors especially radiation exposure is a major risk for glioblastoma multiforme and Iraq had been exposed in a relatively short period to 2 international wars with documented radiation exposure, so this paper might give justification for establishment of a new glioblastoma cell line. This cell line has been established from a cerebral glioblastoma multiforme in a 72-year-old Iraqi man who underwent surgery for an intracranial tumour in 2005. The morphology, growth kinetics, karyotype, immunocytochemistry and angiogenesis factor expression profile of this ANGM5 cell line were studied. The cell line has been grown continuously for more than 200 serial passages in standard culture media presenting no sign of cell senescence. The cultured cells are elongated or multipolar in shape and the population doubling time is 28 hours. The karyotype is complex and the chromosomal number varied between 46 and 48. The cell line is resistant to Temozolomide, cisplatin, vincristine and etoposide. This chemoresistance could be explained by the overexpression of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) which found to be overexpressed by this cell line. Immunocytochemistry also showed that this cell line exhibited several characteristic features of glioblastomas, analysis of glial markers demonstrated that cells are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and negative for nestin and calbindin. Protein microarray analysis showed very high production of TIMP2 as well as other factors that are important for the invasiveness and aggressiveness of glioblastoma.

Pulses of infrared radiation (IR; 1,863 nm, 200 micros, 200-250 Hz for 2-5 s, delivered via an optical fiber) produced a rapid, transient temperature increase of 6-12degreeC (above a baseline of 24-30degreeC). These IR pulse trains evoked transient increases in both nuclear and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) of 0.20-1.4 microM, with a simultaneous reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in regions containing endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

608,"Low-dose radiation hypersensitivity in human tumor cell lines: effects of cell-cell contact and nutritional deprivation. The hyper-radiosensitivity at low doses recently observed in vitro in a number of cell lines is thought to have important implications for improving tumor radiotherapy. However, cell-cell contact and the cellular environment influence cellular radiosensitivity at higher doses, and they may alter hyper-radiosensitivity in vivo. To confirm this supposition, we investigated the effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on low-dose hypersensitivity in vitro. Cell survival in the low-dose range (3 cGy to 2 Gy) was studied in cells of two human glioma (BMG-1 and U-87) and two human oral squamous carcinoma (PECA-4451 and PECA-4197) lines using a conventional macrocolony assay. The effects of cell density, multiplicity and nutritional deprivation on hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance were studied in cells of the BMG-1 cell line, which showed prominent hypersensitivity and induced radioresistance. The induction of growth inhibition, cell cycle delay, micronuclei and apoptosis was also studied at the hyper-radiosensitivity-inducing low doses. Hyper-radiosensitivity/induced radioresistance was evident in the cells of all four cell lines to varying extents, with maximum sensitivity at 10-30 cGy, followed by an increase in survival up to 50 cGy-1 Gy. Both the glioma cell lines had more prominent hyper-radiosensitivity than the two squamous carcinoma cell lines. Low doses inducing maximum hyper-radiosensitivity did not cause significant growth inhibition, micronucleation or apoptosis in BMG-1 cells, but a transient G(1)/S-phase block was evident. Irradiating and incubating BMG-1 cells at high density for 0 or 4 h before plating, as well as irradiating cells as microcolonies, reduced hyper-radiosensitivity significantly, indicating the role of cell-cell contact-mediated processes. Liquid holding of BMG-1 cells in HBSS + 1% serum during and after irradiation for 4 h significantly reduced hyper-radiosensitivity, suggesting that hyper-radiosensitivity may be due partly to active damage fixation processes at low doses. Therefore, our findings suggest that the damage-induced signaling mechanisms influenced by (or mediated through) cell-cell contact or the cellular environment, as well as the lesion fixation processes, play an important role in hyper-radiosensitivity. Further studies are required to determine the exact nature of the damage that triggers these responses as well as for evaluating the potential of low-dose therapy.",Excluded
366,"Comprehensive analysis of the role of DNA repair gene polymorphisms on risk of glioma. Much of the variation in inherited risk of glioma is likely to be explained by combinations of common low risk variants. The established relationship between glioma risk and exposure to ionizing radiation led us to examine whether variants in the DNA repair genes contribute to disease susceptibility. We evaluated 1127 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) supplemented with 388 putative functional SNPs to capture most of the common variation in 136 DNA repair genes, in five unique case-control series from four different countries (1013 cases, 1016 controls). We identified 16 SNPs associated with glioma risk at the 1% significance level. The highest association observed across the five independent case-control datasets involved rs243356, which maps to intron 3 of CHAF1A (trend odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.54; P = 0.0002; false-positive report probability = 0.055, based on a prior probability of 0.01). Our results provide additional support for the hypothesis that low penetrance variants contribute to the risk of developing glioma and suggest that a genetic variant located in or around the CHAF1A gene contributes to disease risk.",Excluded
618,"Local tumor control after retreatment of spinal metastasis using stereotactic body radiotherapy; comparison with initial treatment group. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate local control rates after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in recurrent spinal metastasis after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and new spinal metastatic lesions.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records and radiological data was performed on 54 retreatment and 131 initial SBRT patients. To compare various fractionation schedules, the biologically effective dose (BED) was applied. SBRT dose was calculated with linear-quadratic model and normalized to a 2-Gy equivalent dose (nBED, alpha/beta =2 Gy for spinal cord, alpha/beta =10 Gy for tumor). Doses to a point within the spinal cord that received the maximum dose (Pmax) were checked. Local control failure was defined as progression by imaging study. Overall survival, progression free survival, delivered radiation dose to tumor and spinal cord, and spinal cord Pmax nBED were compared in two groups.RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation doses to tumor margin during SBRT were 51.1 Gy2/10 (retreatment) and 50.7 Gy2/10 (initial treatment). Mean survival was 29.6 months (overall)/20.7 months (retreatment)/ 32.4 months (initial treatment). Mean progression free period was 23.9 months (overall)/18.0 months (retreatment)/ 26.0 months (initial treatment). Radiological control rates of retreatment and initial treatment group were 96%/95% at six months, 81%/89% at 12 months and 79%/90% at 24 months. Among 54 retreatment lesions, 13 lesions showed local control failure during follow-up. With regard to spinal cord radiation dose during SBRT, Spinal cord Pmax nBED was 46.2 Gy2/2 (retreatment) and 48.7 Gy2/2 (initial treatment). In retreatment group, total nBED to spinal cord was a mean of 83.4 Gy2/2. There was no case of radiation myelopathy detected.CONCLUSIONS: Retreatment of spinal metastases using SBRT provided effective local control without neurological complications.",Excluded
187,"Image guided focused ultrasound: Development of a comprehensive treatment planning, monitoring and control, and assessment. Background/introduction: MRgFUS offers unambiguous advantages over other current treatment modalities, as it is noninvasive and does not use ionizing radiation. Further, ultrasonically-controlled stable and inertial microbubble oscillations exert forces that can, among others, activate cell's mechanoreceptors, disrupt cellular and vascular membranes, accelerate the dissolution of blood clots, enhance thermal ablation, and induce localized tissue erosionetc. FUS can also be used transcranially for tumor ablation, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuromodulation, etc. Harnessing and, potentially, combining these abilities holds great promise for therapy and diagnosis of cancer and cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases and disorders. For the wide-spread use of these approaches, development of methods and technology to enable precise planning, monitoring and control, and assessment of their outcome are essential. Method(s): We developed a novel noninvasive and clinically relevant framework (Fig. 1) that combines i) multimodality imaging (US/MR/CT), ii) 3D Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) numerical simulations, and iii) an integrated MR and US imaging FUS system for guiding FUS therapy. The proposed framework enables accurate treatment planning, via visualization of anatomic structures (MRI), extraction of their acoustic properties (CT) and simulation of US propagation (3D FDTD), which includes realistic microbubble acoustic emissions. The co-registration of CT (skull) with the MR and US datasets allowed us to model and study the microbubble emissions propagation through the skull and refine a standard PAM back-projection algorithm to account for spatially varying wave propagation effects, such as refraction and diffraction. The key component of our framework is the MR and US imaging guided FUS system that is used to monitor and control both the thermal and mechanical effects of FUS transcranially, here using manual and simple on-off controllers. Finally, using MR contrast agent as drug surrogate, the proposed framework is used to assess drug uptake after FUS-BBB disruption. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): The incorporation of a variable speed of sound to the PAM back-projection algorithm corrected the aberrations introduced by the skull (NHP and Human). Further, more than 94% agreement in the FWHM of the axial and transverse line profiles between the simulations incorporating microbubble emissions and experimentally-determined PAMs was observed in NHP. The acoustic emissions monitoring allowed to fine-tune the sonication power for efficacious FUS-BBB disruption in glioma-bearing rat, while, MR temperature imaging based FUS controller allowed to attain constant focal temperature (temperature rise: 7+/-1.5degreeC, for 5 mins) in the brain of a healthy rat. These abilities that have not been previously shown provide a clinically relevant framework for guiding FUS in the brain. We envision that the proposed framework will be essential for developing, optimizing, and translating current and new therapeutic FUS approaches to the clinics.",Excluded

Several researchers have proposed that the ""trigger"" for syncope is an empty ventricle, initiated when a hypercontractile state, possibly due to a sudden surge in epinephrine, causes the walls of the left ventricle to touch leading to a profound sympatho-inhibition and intense vagal stimulation.HYPOTHESIS: A markedly reduced left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) achieved during progressive, presyncopal-limited lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is the trigger for syncope.METHODS: Eight healthy men, age 25.1+/-1.3 yr, volunteered for the study. Changes in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and LVESV were measured, using two-dimensional echocardiography, at each stage of LBNP from rest up to presyncope (PS). Plasma venous catecholamine concentrations were measured at the end of each stage by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection.RESULTS: All subjects reached PS. Three men became bradycardic at presyncope while five remained tachycardic. LVESV decreased by 28% at PS with no evidence of ventricular cavity obliteration. Norepinephrine increased by 44% from rest to PS, but no epinephrine surge was detected (35% increase from rest to PS).CONCLUSION: These data indicate that it is possible to initiate syncope with only a 28% decrease in LVESV, and that sympatho-inhibition and bradycardia are not required elements for syncope to occur.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To verify whether the treatment of brain oligometastases with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) plus stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) or surgical resection results in different outcomes.METHODS: Files of patients affected by brain metastases submitted to surgical resection followed by WBRT (group A) or WBRT + SRT (group B) were retrospectively selected for this study. The two treatment groups were matched for the following potential prognostic factors: WBRT schedule, age, gender, performance status, tumor type, number of brain metastases, extra-cerebral metastases, and recursive partitioning analysis class (RPA). The outcomes of patients in both groups were evaluated in terms of toxicity, local control, and overall survival.RESULTS: Total of 97 patients were selected (56 male; 42 female) who were respectively submitted to surgical resection followed by WBRT (group A, n = 50 patients) or WBRT + SRT (Group B, n = 47 patients). Median follow-up was 95 months (range, 8-171 months). The 1-year local control rates were 46.0% and 69.0% respectively. No significant difference in local tumor control was observed between group A and B (p = 0.10). Median overall survival was 15 and 19 months in group A and B, respectively. One-year survival was 56.0% and 62%, respectively.

548,"Timed hypocaloric feeding and melatonin synchronize the suprachiasmatic clockwork in rats, but with opposite timing of behavioral output. Temporal organization of the molecular clockwork and behavioral output were investigated in nocturnal rats housed in constant darkness and synchronized to nonphotic cues (daily normocaloric or hypocaloric feeding and melatonin infusion) or light (light-dark cycle and daily 1-h light exposure). Clock gene (Per1, Per2 and Bmal1) and clock-controlled gene (Vasopressin) expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei was assessed over 24 h. Light and exogenous melatonin synchronized the molecular clock, signaling, respectively, 'daytime' and 'nighttime', without affecting temporal organization of behavioral output (rest/activity rhythm). By contrast, synchronization to hypocaloric feeding led to a striking temporal change between gene expression in the suprachiasmatic clock and waveform of locomotor activity rhythm, rats then becoming active during the subjective day (diurnal-like temporal organization). When the time of feeding coincided with activity offset, normocaloric feeding also synchronized the locomotor activity rhythm with no apparent switch in temporal organization. Peak of Per2 expression in the piriform cortex occurred between the beginning and the middle of the activity/feeding period, depending on the synchronizer. These data demonstrate that even though the suprachiasmatic clockwork can be synchronized to nonphotic cues, hypocaloric feeding likely acts downstream from clock gene oscillations in the suprachiasmatic nuclei to yield a stable yet opposite organization of the rest/activity cycle.",Excluded
77,"Effects of millimeter waves on ionic currents of Lymnaea neurons. The effects of mm-waves 60.22-62.22 GHz and 75 GHz on A-type K+ currents and the effects of 61.22 GHz on Ca2+ currents of Lymnaea neurons were investigated using a whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. The open end of a rectangular waveguide covered with a thin Teflon film served as a radiator. Specific absorption rates at the waveguide outlet, inserted into physiological solution, were in the range of 0-2400 W/kg. Millimeter wave irradiation increased the peak amplitudes, activation rates, and inactivation rates of both ion currents. The changes in A-type K+ current were not dependent on the irradiation frequency. It was shown that the changes in the amplitudes and kinetics of both currents resulted from the temperature rise produced by irradiation. No additional effects of irradiation on A-type K+ current other than thermal were found when tested at the phase transition temperature or in the presence of ethanol. Ethanol reduced the thermal effect of irradiation. Millimeter waves had no effect on the steady-state activation and inactivation curves, suggesting that the membrane surface charge and binding of calcium ions to the membrane in the area of channel locations did not change.",Excluded

Introduction: Pineal parenchymal tumor constitutes less than 1% of primitive tumors of the CNS and is classified by WHO into pineocytoma (PC)-grade I, pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation (PPTID)-grade II/III and pinealoblastoma (PB)-grade IV. Material(s) and Method(s): We intended to assess the clinical features and treatment outcome in patients of pineal parenchymal tumor attending our hospital from 2003-13. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): 23 patients met the study criterion (median age=22 years and male: female=14:9). Presenting complaints included headache (73.91%), visual symptoms (43.48%), vomiting (30.43%) and ataxia (26.09%). Preoperative contrast enhanced MRI and CT scan of brain were performed in 78.26% and 17.3% of patients respectively. Spinal drop metastasis and CSF cytology positivity were noted in 3 and 2 patients respectively. Surgery included gross total resection in 21.74%, near total resection in 13.04%, subtotal resection in 17.39% and tumor biopsy in 43.48% of the patients. 12 (52.17%) patients required the placement of VP shunt. Histopathology was confirmative of PB in 14 (60.87%) patients, PPTID in 6 (26.09%) patients and PC in 3 (13.04%) patients. MIB-1 labeling index varied from 2-80% with median value of 30% and 4.5% in PB and PPTID respectively. 22 (95.65%) patients underwent radiation therapy- craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in 14(60.87%) patients, whole brain radiation in 1 patient, whole ventricular radiation in 1 patient and local radiation in 6 (26.09%) patients. Majority (85.7%) of patients of PB underwent CSI- 36 Gy/ 20 fractions/ 4 weeks to whole brain followed by boost of 20 Gy/10 fractions/ 2 weeks to pineal region and 30-36 Gy/ 20 fractions/ 4 weeks to spinal axis as per risk stratification. Systemic chemotherapy was administered in 12 (52.17%) patients (11-PB and 1-PC) with EP (etoposide and carboplatin) being the most common regimen (30.43%). The median number of cycles administered was 6 (range 3-6). After a median follow-up of 26.87 months, death and recurrence were observed in 2 and 10 patients (local recurrence- 34.78% and spinal drop metastases- 26.09%) respectively. Median RFS was noted to be 2.33 years, 14.29 years and 6.76 years in patients of PB, PPTID and PC respectively. The 2 and 3 year actuarial RFS rates in the entire cohort were respectively 71.6% and 57.9%. Salvage treatment was offered in 6 patients. Median overall survival was not reached. On univariate analysis (Log rank test), age (<18 versus >18 years), sex, histology, extent of surgery (biopsy versus resection) and use of chemotherapy had no significant impact on RFS. Conclusion(s): Maximal safe resection followed by radiation therapy is the mainstay of treatment in pineal parenchymal tumor. Radiation volume encompasses the craniospinal axis in pinealoblastoma and the tumor bed with margin in pineocytoma. Platinum based combination chemotherapy should be added in adjuvant treatment in pinealoblastoma.",Excluded
953,"Airborne isolation: Public health infringes on palliative care. Introduction: Development of cavitary lung lesions in a palliative care patient with metastatic lung cancer necessitated invasive diagnostic studies to rule out contagious tuberculosis. Case report: This 63 year old African American man was initially treated with chemotherapy and radiation of an inoperable right upper lobe squamous cell lung carcinoma. He subsequently developed brain metastases which were treated with radiation. Six weeks afterwards he developed progressive weakness and dyspnea on exertion. Computerized tomography of the chest showed two large cavitary lesions. He was transferred from the palliative care unit to a respiratory isolation room. Bronchoalveloar lavage was performed yielding negative smears x 5 for M. tuberculosis. Cultures grew Pneumocystis jiroveci. Smears also demonstrated Candida species and Aspergilla. Antibiotic coverage was broadened for these agents with improvement in his symptoms. Discussion(s): Treatment in palliative care is directed towards symptom management. In this care, however, the possibility of a highly contagious illness necessitated a more aggressive diagnostic approach. In ethical terms the protection of the health of those persons attending this patient (distributive justice) superseded the patient's choice for palliative measures (autonomy).

The PET data were reconstructed using CT-based AC (CTAC) to generate reference PET-CTAC and without AC to produce PET-nonAC images. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to generate PET attenuation corrected images (PET-DLAC) from PET-nonAC. The quantitative accuracy of this approach was investigated separately for each radiotracer considering the values obtained from PET-CTAC images as reference. A segmented AC map (PET-SegAC) containing soft-tissue and background air was also included in the evaluation. Quantitative analysis of PET images demonstrated superior performance of the DLAC approach compared to SegAC technique for all tracers. Despite the relatively low quantitative bias observed when using the DLAC approach, this approach appears vulnerable to outliers, resulting in noticeable local pseudo uptake and false cold regions. Direct AC in image-space using deep learning demonstrated quantitatively acceptable performance with less than 9% absolute SUV bias for the four different investigated neuroimaging radiotracers. However, this approach is vulnerable to outliers which result in large local quantitative bias. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Human Brain Mapping published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
169,"Radiation-Induced Optic Neuropathy: Clinical and Imaging Profile of Twelve Patients. BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RON) is a form of delayed radionecrosis of the anterior visual pathways, which develops within months to years after external cranial irradiation and causes severe and irreversible vision loss. Small series reports have adequately documented its clinical features, but imaging characteristics have been less completely described.METHODS: We accrued cases from the University of Michigan Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic files and from cases coded as ""radiation optic neuropathy"" at the University of Michigan Medical Center between 1994 and 2017. All patients had undergone 3D-conformal linear accelerator (photon) external beam radiation. We collected clinical details of vision loss, including the temporal relationship to radiation. A single neuroradiologist (E.A.L.) evaluated all available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, noting the presence of enhancement, expansion, or volume loss of the optic nerves or chiasm, corresponding T2 signal abnormalities, and the absence of demyelination or confounding compressive lesions.RESULTS: Twelve patients (15 eyes) met inclusion criteria. Vision loss was usually monocular at outset, but both optic nerves were eventually involved in 3 (25%) patients. Although usually sudden in onset, vision loss often declined slowly over many months, frequently to finger counting, or worse without recovery. An afferent pupillary defect was always present at the time of presentation. Most affected optic discs were pale at the time of first visual symptoms, indicating that subclinical optic nerve damage had been present for several weeks. The latency from completion of radiation to onset of vision loss ranged from 7 to 48 months (average: 18 months). In 2 patients, radiation was delivered to the whole brain, rather than being limited to the anterior visual pathway. MRI typically displayed a discrete region of enhancement of the affected prechiasmatic optic nerve, often with expansion and high T2 signal in the enhancing segment. In 3 affected eyes, enhancement was apparent on imaging completed 3-6 weeks before the onset of vision loss. In one patient, segmental prechiasmatic enhancement became evident only on repeat MRI completed 7 months after vision loss. The duration of enhancement among 9 eyes with follow-up MRIs was at least 2 months, but in one case, enhancement was still present on a study performed 17 months after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This study further delineates the profile of RON. Visual loss is often acute, profound, and monocular but may decline slowly after acute onset and later affect both optic nerves. High-resolution MRI of the optic nerves usually will display enhancement of a discrete segment of the intracranial prechiasmatic optic nerve, often with accompanying expansion and T2 hyperintensity. In some cases, these imaging features may precede vision loss. They may be subtle or appear after vision loss. Enhancement lingers for a wide interval, ranging in this study from 2 to at least 17 months. Recognition of these imaging characteristics assists in confirmation of the diagnosis of RON.",Excluded

Although the excellent diagnostic accuracy of the procedure is well known, its use is limited to specialized centers in Europe as parts of clinical trials. Literature reports confirm the superiority of 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs PET/CT for the assessment of well-differentiated NET over morphologic imaging procedures, SRS, and even PET/CT using metabolic radiotracers. 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs provide good visualization of NET lesions at both the primary and the metastatic sites (node, bone, liver, and unusual localizations). The advantages of their use over metabolic tracers (18F-DOPA, 18F-FDG) are not only limited to a better overall detection rate but also to the fact that they also provide data on SSTR expression on target lesions, resulting a fundamental procedure before starting therapy with either hot or cold somatostatin analogues. Moreover, they can be used also in centers without an on-site cyclotron. To interpret 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs images correctly, it is crucial to understand the tracer's biodistribution as well as the conditions that may alter tracer uptake. Considering that SSTR are expressed on activated lymphocytes, all areas of inflammation show 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRTs uptake. Areas of increased uptake in frequent sites of inflammation (eg, thyroid, mediastinal nodes, inguinal nodes, and nodes adjacent to areas of recent surgery/trauma) should be interpreted with care. A detailed clinical history with particular attention to concomitant disorders (eg, sarcoidosis, chronic gastritis, chronic thryoiditis) and recent invasive procedures or trauma may often help image interpretation. The presence of uptake in the head of the pancreas should always be carefully evaluated because it may often be benign. Otherwise, because the pancreas is also a frequent site of NET onset, particular attention should be devoted to the evaluation of the uptake pattern (diffuse more likely to be benign) and to the comparison with other imaging techniques. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

175,"Risk factors for early death after surgery in patients with brain metastases: reevaluation of the indications for and role of surgery. Surgical resection remains an important option for the treatment of brain metastases despite recent advancements in radiotherapy and systemic therapy. When selecting surgical candidates, it is important to exclude terminal cases who will receive neither a survival benefit nor an improvement in their quality of life. We reviewed a total of 264 surgical cases of brain metastases and analyzed the clinical characteristics of early death in order to clarify the indication for and the role of surgery. The median survival time (MST) after surgery in all cases was 12.4 months. Early death was defined as death within 6 months, and 23% (62 cases) of this series were succumbed to this. A decrease in postoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (<70) (P = 0.041), lack of systemic therapy after surgery (P < 0.0001), and uncontrolled extracranial malignancies (P = 0.0022) were significantly related to early death in multivariate analysis, while preoperative KPS (<70) and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class were related to early death only in univariate analysis (P < 0.05). When analyzing patients with uncontrolled extracranial malignancies and those with a postoperative KPS score of 70 or greater (who were generally candidates for systemic therapy), the MST was significantly longer in the systemic therapy (+) group compared with the systemic therapy (-) group (12.5 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.0026).

BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation exposure promotes sunburn and thereby acute and chronic inflammatory processes, contributing to pain development and maintenance. New therapeutic alternatives are necessary because typical treatments can cause adverse effects. An attractive alternative would be to target the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a calcium-permeable, non-selective cation channel, which is involved in a variety of inflammatory pain models.OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the peripheral participation of TRPA1 using a topical treatment (HC030031 gel formulation; a selective TRPA1 antagonist) in nociception and inflammation caused by a UVB radiation-induced burn model in male mice (25-30 g).METHODS: The mice were anaesthetised, and just the right hind paw was exposed to UVB radiation (0.75 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). Topical treatments were applied immediately after irradiation and once a day for 8 days.RESULTS: HC030031 gel presented suitable pH and spreadability factor, ensuring its quality and the therapeutic effect. HC030031 0.05 % reversed UVB-induced mechanical and cold allodynia, with maximum inhibition (I<sub>max</sub>) of 69 +/- 13 % and 100 % (on day 4), respectively. HC030031 0.05 % also reduced the paw edema and MPO activity, with I<sub>max</sub> of 77 +/- 6 % (on day 5) and 69 +/- 28 %, respectively.

32,"Time of Flight 3D Magnetic Resonance Angiography in the Follow-up of Coiled Cerebral Aneurysms. SUMMARY: The use of Guglielmi Detachable Coil (GDC) for the en do vascular treatment of intracerebral aneurysms is increasing, particularly in those aneurysms for which there is a high surgical morbidity and mortality. However, the long-term efficacy of GDC is not known. Until the natural history of GDC treatment is established longterm follow-up in this cohort of patients is required, of necessity involving repeated intraarterial angiography (IA DSA) with its known attendant risks and exposure to ionising radiation. Three dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D TOF MRA) is now readily accepted as a non-invasive screening tool for familial aneurysmal disease and has been used as an alternative to IA DSA in the surgical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. MRA in patients treated with GDC is safe, imparts no radiation dose and provides acceptable image quality. The aim of this study was to assess 3D TOP MRA source data, maximum intensity projection (MIP) and 3D isosurface reconstruction in comparison to IA DSA in the follow-up of 25 patients treated with GDC. Images were assessed for parent and branch artery flow, the presence of neck recurrence and aneurysm regrowth. There was good correlation for all these features when 3D isosurface MRA and source data were compared with IA DSA. The correlation between MIP MRA and IA DSA was less robust.

213,"Extraction of optical properties and prediction of light distribution in rat brain tissue. Predicting the distribution of light inside any turbid media, such as biological tissue, requires detailed information about the optical properties of the medium, including the absorption and scattering coefficients and the anisotropy factor. Particularly, in biophotonic applications where photons directly interact with the tissue, this information translates to system design optimization, precision in light delivery, and minimization of unintended consequences, such as phototoxicity or photobleaching. In recent years, optogenetics has opened up a new area in deep brain stimulation with light and the method is widely adapted by researchers for the study of the brain circuitries and the dynamics of neurological disorders. A key factor for a successful optogenetic stimulation is delivering an adequate amount of light to the targeted brain objects. The adequate amount of light needed to stimulate each brain object is identified by the tissue optical properties as well as the type of opsin expressed in the tissue, wavelength of the light, and the physical dimensions of the targeted area. Therefore, to implement a precise light delivery system for optogenetics, detailed information about the optical properties of the brain tissue and a mathematical model that incorporates all determining factors is needed to find a good estimation of light distribution in the brain. In general, three measurements are required to obtain the optical properties of any tissue, namely diffuse transmitted light, diffuse reflected light, and transmitted ballistic beam. In this report, these parameters were measured in vitro using intact rat brain slices of 500 mum thickness via a two-integrating spheres optical setup. Then, an inverse adding doubling method was used to extract the optical properties of the tissue from the collected data. These experiments were repeated to cover the whole brain tissue with high spatial resolution for the three different cuts (transverse, sagittal, and coronal) and three different wavelengths (405, 532, and 635 nm) in the visible range of the spectrum. A three-dimensional atlas of the rat brain optical properties was constructed based on the experimental measurements. This database was linked to a Monte Carlo toolbox to simulate light distribution in the tissue for different light source configurations.",Excluded
682,"Skin denervation, neuropathology, and neuropathic pain in a laser-induced focal neuropathy. Small-diameter sensory nerves innervating the skin are responsive to noxious stimuli, and an injury to these nerves is presumably related to neuropathic pain. Injury-induced neuropathic pain in animals can be produced by laser irradiation, which usually requires concomitant use of photosensitive dyes, known as the photochemical approach. It is not clear whether laser irradiation alone can induce neuropathic pain. In addition, two issues are important to apply these approaches: the relationship between the extent of laser irradiation and the occurrence of neuropathic pain, and the susceptibility of small-diameter sensory nerves in the skin to laser-induced neuropathic pain. To address these issues, we designed a new model of focal neuropathy by applying a diode laser of 532 nm (100 mW) to the sciatic nerve and evaluated small-diameter nerves by quantifying skin innervation and large-diameter nerves by measuring amplitudes of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP). Immediately after laser irradiation, epineurial vessels were occluded due to the formation of thrombi, and the blood flow through these vessels was markedly reduced. On postoperative day (POD) 2, animals developed characteristic manifestations of neuropathic pain, including spontaneous pain behaviors, thermal hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia. These phenomena peaked during PODs 7-21, and lasted for 3-6 weeks. The neuropathology at the irradiated site of the sciatic nerve included a focal area of axonal degeneration surrounded by demyelination and endoneurial edema. The extent of damage to large-diameter motor and sensory nerves after laser irradiation was evaluated by nerve conduction studies. On the irradiated sides, amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were reduced to 65.0% (P < 0.0001) and 42.5% (P < 0.01) of those on the control sides, respectively. Motor innervation of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) on plantar muscles was examined by combined cholinesterase histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. The ratio of innervated NMJs on the operated sides decreased to 76.3% of that on the control side. Skin innervation in the territory of the irradiated sciatic nerves was evaluated by immunohistochemistry with neuronal markers. Among these markers, epidermal nerve densities for protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P (SP) were significantly lower on the irradiated sides than the control sides with a different degree of loss for each marker (42.1-53.1%, P < 0.05). Results suggest that laser-induced focal neuropathy provides a new system for studying neuropathic pain. With this approach, the extent of nerve injury can be quantified. Both small-diameter epidermal nerves and large-diameter sensory and motor nerves are susceptible to laser-induced injury of different degrees.",Excluded
908,"Selectivity of canary HVC neurons for the bird's own song: modulation by photoperiodic conditions. To what extent seasonal factors modify the neuronal functional properties within the nuclei of the avian song system remains an open question. In adult songbirds, neurons of the song premotor nucleus HVC (used as a proper name) exhibit selective responses for the bird's own song (BOS). Here we examine whether, outside the breeding season, when songs are less stereotyped, HVC neurons of male canaries still respond selectively to the BOS produced during this period. In an initial experiment, single-unit recordings (n = 114) revealed that the neuronal selectivity for the current BOS was attenuated in males exposed to a short-day photoperiod (typical of the nonbreeding season) compared with that found in males exposed to a long-day photoperiod. In long-day conditions, 35% of the cells responded to the BOS, whereas only 12% did in short-day conditions; there were four times more selective cells (d' > 1) in long-day than in short-day conditions. To determine whether these effects were the consequence of differences in acoustic features between breeding and nonbreeding songs, neurons (n = 72) recorded in short-day conditions were tested with both a short-day BOS and a long-day BOS. A low percentage of neurons exhibited responses to short-day or to long-day BOS (11% for each song). Responses of putative interneurons (spike duration < 0.4 ms) and of putative relay cells were similarly attenuated by the short-day conditions. These results strongly suggest that, in canary, rather than being a fixed property, the selectivity for the BOS moves along a continuum and peaks when the day length mimics the breeding conditions.",Excluded

In a snake, Viper aspis, and the lizard Gallotia galloti, regeneration is slow, although some retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons eventually reach the visual centers (Rio et al. [1989] Brain Res 479:151-156; Lang et al. [1998] Glia 23:61-74). By contrast, in a lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus, numerous RGC axons regenerate rapidly to the visual centers, but unless animals are stimulated visually, the regenerated projection lacks topography and animals remain blind via the experimental eye (Beazley et al. [2003] J. Neurotrauma 20:1263-1269). V. aspis, G. galloti, and C. ornatus belong respectively to the Serpentes, Lacertidae, and Agamidae within the Eureptilia, the major modern group of living reptiles comprising the Squamata (snakes, lizards, and geckos) and the Crocodyllia. Here we have extended the findings on Eureptilia to include two geckos (Gekkonidae), Cehyra variegata and Nephrurus stellatus. We also examined a turtle, Chelodina oblonga, the Testudines being the sole surviving representatives of the Parareptilia, the more ancient reptilian group. In all three species, visually elicited behavioral responses were absent throughout regeneration, a result supported electrophysiologically; axonal tracing revealed that only a small proportion of RGC axons crossed the lesion and none entered the contralateral optic tract. RGC axons failed to reach the chiasm in C. oblonga, and in G. variegata, and N. stellatus RGC axons entered the opposite optic nerve; a limited ipsilateral projection was seen in G. variegata. Our results support a heterogeneous response to axotomy within the reptiles, each of which is nevertheless dysfunctional.",Excluded
536,"Evaluation of the RF heating of a generic deep brain stimulator exposed in 1.5 T magnetic resonance scanners. The radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic field of magnetic resonance (MR) scanners can result in significant tissue heating due to the RF coupling with the conducting parts of medical implants. The objective of this article is to evaluate the advantages and shortcomings of a new four-tier approach based on a combined numerical and experimental procedure, designed to demonstrate safety of implants during MR scans. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study analyzing this technique. The evaluation is performed for 1.5 T MR scanners using a generic model of a deep brain stimulator (DBS) with a straight lead and a helical lead. The results show that the approach is technically feasible and provides sound and conservative information about the potential heating of implants. We demonstrate that (1) applying optimized tools results in reasonable uncertainties for the overall evaluation; (2) each tier reduces the overestimation by several dB at the cost of more demanding evaluation steps; (3) the implant with the straight lead would cause local temperature increases larger than 18 degreeC at the RF exposure limit for the normal operating mode; (4) Tier 3 is not sufficient for the helical implant; and (5) Tier 4 might be too demanding to be performed for complex implants. We conclude with a suggestion for a procedure that follows the same concept but is between Tier 3 and 4. In addition, the evaluation of Tier 3 has shown consistency with current scan practice, namely, the resulting heat at the lead tip is less than 3.5 degreeC for the straight lead and 0.7 degreeC for the helix lead for scans at the current applied MR scan restrictions for deep brain stimulation at a head average SAR of 0.1 W/kg.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of fast neutron radiotherapy for the treatment of salivary gland neoplasms.DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.SETTING: University of Washington Cancer Center, Neutron Facility, Seattle.PATIENTS: The medical records of 279 patients treated with curative intent using fast neutron radiotherapy at the University of Washington Cancer Center were reviewed. Of the 279 patients, 263 had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment (16 had no evidence of gross residual disease), 141 had tumors of a major salivary gland, and 138 had tumors of minor salivary glands. The median follow-up period was 36 months (range, 1-142 months).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local-regional control, cause-specific survival, and freedom from metastasis.RESULTS: The 6-year actuarial cause-specific survival rate was 67%. Multivariate analysis revealed that low group stage (I-II) disease, minor salivary sites, lack of skull base invasion, and primary disease were associated with a statistically significant improvement in cause-specific survival. The 6-year actuarial local-regional control rate was 59%. Multivariate analysis revealed size 4 cm or smaller, lack of base of skull invasion, prior surgical resection, and no previous radiotherapy to have a statistically significant improved local-regional control. Sixteen patients without evidence of gross residual disease had a 100% 6-year actuarial local-regional control. The 6-year actuarial freedom from metastasis rate was 64%. Factors associated with decreased development of systemic metastases included negative lymph nodes at the time of treatment and lack of base of skull involvement. The 6-year actuarial rate of development of grade 3 or 4 long-term toxicity (using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research on the Treatment of Cancer criteria) was 10%. No patient experienced grade 5 toxic effects.CONCLUSIONS: Neuron radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with salivary gland neoplasms who have gross residual disease and achieves excellent local-regional control in patients without evidence of gross disease.",Excluded
788,"Brain irradiation leads to persistent neuroinflammation and long-term neurocognitive dysfunction in a region-specific manner. Long-term cognitive deficits are observed after treatment of brain tumors or metastases by radiotherapy. Treatment optimization thus requires a better understanding of the effects of radiotherapy on specific brain regions, according to their sensitivity and interconnectivity. In the present study, behavioral tests supported by immunohistology and magnetic resonance imaging provided a consistent picture of the persistent neurocognitive decline and neuroinflammation after the onset of irradiation-induced necrosis in the right primary somatosensory cortex of Fischer rats. Necrosis surrounded by neovascularization was first detected 54 days after irradiation and then spread to 110 days in the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory region, striatum and right ventricle, resulting in fiber bundle disruption and demyelination in the corpus callosum of the right hemisphere. These structural damages translated into selective behavioral changes including spatial memory loss, disinhibition of anxiety-like behaviors, hyperactivity and pain hypersensitivity, but no significant alteration in motor coordination and grip strength abilities. Concomitantly, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, accompanied by infiltration of leukocytes (CD45+) and T-cells (CD3+) cooperated to shape the neuroinflammation response. Overall, our study suggests that the slow and gradual onset of cellular damage would allow adaptation in brain regions that are susceptible to neuronal plasticity; while other cerebral structures that do not have this capacity would be more affected. The planning of radiotherapy, adjusted to the sensitivity and adaptability of brain structures, could therefore preserve certain neurocognitive functions; while higher doses of radiation could be delivered to brain areas that can better adapt to this treatment. In addition, strategies to block early post-radiation events need to be explored to prevent the development of long-term cognitive dysfunction.",Included

376,"On glioblastoma and the search for a cure: where do we stand?. Although brain tumours have been documented and recorded since the nineteenth century, 2016 marked 90 years since Percival Bailey and Harvey Cushing coined the term ""glioblastoma multiforme"". Since that time, although extensive developments in diagnosis and treatment have been made, relatively little improvement on prognosis has been achieved. The resilience of GBM thus makes treating this tumour one of the biggest challenges currently faced by neuro-oncology. Aggressive and robust development, coupled with difficulties of complete resection, drug delivery and therapeutic resistance to treatment are some of the main issues that this nemesis presents today. Current treatments are far from satisfactory with poor prognosis, and focus on palliative management rather than curative intervention. However, therapeutic research leading to developments in novel treatment stratagems show promise in combating this disease. Here we present a review on GBM, looking at the history and advances which have shaped neurosurgery over the last century that cumulate to the present day management of GBM, while also exploring future perspectives in treatment options that could lead to new treatments on the road to a cure.

Ionizing irradiation is an effective treatment for intracranial tumors but is limited by the potential adverse effects induced in surrounding normal brain. These effects can include cognitive impairments, and whereas the pathogenesis of such injury has not yet been definitively established, it may involve injury to the neurogenic cell population that exists in the dentate subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. Understanding the issues surrounding this topic could have a major impact in the management of specific sequelae associated with cranial irradiation. Although radiation is now becoming a useful tool in investigations into the biology of neurogenesis, the perspective of this review is directed more toward the potential relevance of studying radiation and the stem/precursor cell response.

923,"Ionizing radiation induces endothelial transdifferentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells through the Tie2 signaling pathway. Glioblastomas (GBM) are brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite treatment that combines surgical resection and radio-chemotherapy. These tumors are characterized by abundant vascularization and significant cellular heterogeneity including GBM stem-like cells (GSC) which contribute to tumor aggressiveness, resistance, and recurrence. Recent data has demonstrated that GSC are directly involved in the formation of new vessels via their transdifferentiation into Tumor Derived Endothelial Cells (TDEC). We postulate that cellular stress such as ionizing radiation (IR) could enhance the transdifferentiation of GSC into TDEC. GSC neurospheres isolated from 3 different patients were irradiated or not and were then transdifferentiated into TDEC. In fact, TDEC obtained from irradiated GSC (TDEC IR+) migrate more towards VEGF, form more pseudotubes in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> in vitro and develop more functional blood vessels in Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> plugs implanted in Nude mice than TDEC obtained from non-irradiated GSC. Transcriptomic analysis allows us to highlight an overexpression of Tie2 in TDEC IR+. All IR-induced effects on TDEC were abolished by using a Tie2 kinase inhibitor, which confirms the role of the Tie2 signaling pathway in this process. Finally, by analyzing Tie2 expression in patient GBMs by immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the number of Tie2+ vessels increases in recurrent GBM compared with matched untreated tumors. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IR potentiates proangiogenic features of TDEC through the Tie2 signaling pathway, which indicates a new pathway of treatment-induced tumor adaptation. New therapeutic strategies that associate standard treatment and a Tie2 signaling pathway inhibitor should be considered for future trials.",Excluded
1192,"Dim nighttime light impairs cognition and provokes depressive-like responses in a diurnal rodent. Circadian disruption is a common by-product of modern life. Although jet lag and shift work are well-documented challenges to circadian organization, many more subtle environmental changes cause circadian disruption. For example, frequent fluctuations in the timing of the sleep/wake schedule, as well as exposure to nighttime lighting, likely affect the circadian system. Most studies of these effects have focused on nocturnal rodents, which are very different from diurnal species with respect to their patterns of light exposure and the effects that light can have on their activity. Thus, the authors investigated the effect of nighttime light on behavior and the brain of a diurnal rodent, the Nile grass rat. Following 3 weeks of exposure to standard light/dark (LD; 14:10 light [~150 lux] /dark [0 lux]) or dim light at night (dLAN; 14:10 light [~150 lux] /dim [5 lux]), rats underwent behavioral testing, and hippocampal neurons within CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG) were examined. Three behavioral effects of dLAN were observed: (1) decreased preference for a sucrose solution, (2) increased latency to float in a forced swim test, and (3) impaired learning and memory in the Barnes maze. Light at night also reduced dendritic length in DG and basilar CA1 dendrites. Dendritic length in the DG positively correlated with sucrose consumption in the sucrose anhedonia task. Nighttime light exposure did not disrupt the pattern of circadian locomotor activity, and all grass rats maintained a diurnal activity pattern. Together, these data suggest that exposure to dLAN can alter affective responses and impair cognition in a diurnal animal.",Excluded

We report the case of a patient with medically refractory primary dystonia who was treated with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation.

Consequently, the patient was treated for 9 months at 130 to 185 Hz, by means of the more dorsal contacts, achieving modest results. By reducing the stimulation frequency to 80 Hz, we were able to activate the ventral contacts without inducing side effects. Within days, the patient experienced a dramatic improvement in function that has persisted for 1 year. A further reduction in stimulation frequency to 60 Hz resulted in a worsening of his symptoms.

Neurologic examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a left middle sphenoid wing meningioma compressing the left trigeminal nerve medially. After trying several neuromodulators, she received stereotactic radiotherapy. One month later, the episodes of facial pain were significantly diminished, but she started feeling brief electric paroxysms across her left hemicranium that were clinically identical to those of backwards EF. Serial MRI showed persistence of the meningioma without changes.CONCLUSION: Although the pathogenesis of EF remains uncertain, this case is consistent with a symptomatic origin in the trigeminal root/pathway. The onset of the EF-like pain could have been caused by the compressive effect of the tumour or, most likely, by the radiation.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Longer-lasting electroretinographic recordings of the isolated murine retina were initially achieved by modification of a phosphate-buffered nutrient solution originally developed for the bovine retina. During experiments with a more sensitive mouse retina, apparent model-specific limitations were addressed and improvements were analyzed for their contribution to an optimized full electroretinogram (ERG).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retinas were isolated from dark-adapted mice, transferred to a recording chamber and superfused with different solutions. Scotopic and photopic ERGs were recorded with white flashes every 3 minutes. The phosphate buffer (Sickel-medium) originally used was replaced by a carbonate-based system (Ames-medium), the pH of which was adjusted to 7.7-7.8. Moreover, addition of 0.1 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub> was investigated to reduce b-wave contamination by the slow PIII component typically present in the murine ERG.RESULTS: B-wave amplitudes were increased by the pH-shift (pH 7.4 to pH 7.7) from 22.9 +/- 1.9 microV to 37.5 +/- 2.5 microV. Improved b-wave responses were also achieved by adding small amounts of Ba<sup>2+</sup> (100 microM), which selectively suppressed slow PIII components, thereby unmasking more of the true b-wave amplitude (100.0% with vs. 22.2 +/- 10.7% without Ba<sup>2+</sup>). Ames medium lacking amino acids and vitamins was unable to maintain retinal signaling, as evident in a reversible decrease of the b-wave to 31.8 +/- 3.9% of its amplitude in complete Ames medium.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide optimized conditions for ex vivo ERGs from the murine retina and suggest that careful application of Ba<sup>2+</sup> supports reliable isolation of b-wave responses in mice.

972,"The frequency of adverse events by radiation therapy for atomic bomb survivors with cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): In Japan, there are many survivors who received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb in 1945. Currently, atomic bomb survivors (ABS) who suffered from cancer are treated as same as usual cancer patients. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse events (AE) of radiation therapy (RT) are increased or not in ABS. To clarify the safety of RT for ABS, we evaluated the frequency of AE by RT in ABS. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients who received curative RT for cancer between 2005 and 2010. We selected the ABS who were officially certified by the Japanese government. AE were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score Ver.3. One hundred and sixty-five ABS were recruited in this study. Median age was 74 years old (59 to 93) and 96 (58.2%) were men. Median age at the time receiving ionizing radiation by atomic bomb was 11 years old (0 to 32). One hundred and thirty-six ABS (82.4%) were pre-treatment performance status (PS) 0, 21 (12.7%) was PS 1, and 8 (4.8%) were PS 2 or over. Thirty-seven were diagnosed with head and neck, 32 with genitourinary, 29 with breast, 27 with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic, 23 with lung and mediastinum, and 17 with other cancer. Result(s): One hundred four ABS were definitive irradiation, 48 were postoperative irradiation, and 13 were pre-operative irradiation. Concurrent chemotherapy was performed on 51. Median dose of external RTwas 50 Gy (30 to 78) based on their cancer type. Fifteen patients were performed on stereotactic RT, 12 on intensity-modulated RT, and 11 on brachytherapy. All patients were received standard dose irradiation and completed planned RT. No patients received extended RTover 1 week. Median observation time was 40 months (1 to 84). One hundred fifty-six patients (94.5%) were alive and 9 (5.5%) were dead when at the time investigated. There were no patients who died of AE in the entire course. In acute AE, sixteen patients (9.7%) were classified into grade 3 or above, i.e. one with esophageal mucositis and 15 with hematotoxicity (Grade 3: 11, Grade 4: 4). All these patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Grade 4 or 5 non-hematotoxicitic AE was not identified. In late AE, twelve patients (7.3%) were classified into Grade 3 or above. Four patients were classified into Grade 4, i.e. 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 with cerebral infarction.

The average age of the cohort was 57 years. 45% of the patients were male and 55% were female. 64% were Caucasian, 27% African American, and 9% were of other ethnicities. The median surgical dose was 18 Gy in a single fraction (range 10-20) prescribed to the 90% isodose line. Median follow-up time was 3 months. 14 patients were deceased with a median survival of 14.6 months. Leiomyosarcoma was the most common histology among the cohort with 9 patients. Other histologies included- Ewing's (3), osteosarcoma (2), neufibrosarcoma (2), liposarcoma (2), chondrosarcoma (1), hemangiopercytoma (1), rhabdomyoblastic anaplastic (1), spindle cell (1), and unspecified sarcoma(1). The average tumor volume was 53.12 cc (range 2.02-207.25cc). Overall pain response was 75% (25% partial & 50% complete relief). Pain was stable in 25% of the patients, and no pain progression was observed. Total neurological response was 25% (0% complete, 25% partial). 94% of the patients were neurologically stable or improved after treatment. In one patient (6%) a progressed neurological deficit was observed. Total radiographic response was 67% (0% complete, 29% partial, 38% stable). Local tumor progression was observed in 33% of the patients. One patient initially had a partial radiographic response that progressed after 10 months. Another patient was initially stable but experienced radiographic progression after three months. Eight vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) were noted, two of which may be attributed to SRS. No other adverse effects were observed. Conclusion(s): A total of 23 patients and 78 spinal levels were treated with SRS resulting in fairly good response rates for pain relief, neurologic improvement, and radiographic tumor response (75%, 25%, & 67% respectively). Our results indicate that SRS has a role in the treatment of primary and metastatic sarcomas of the spine. Using slightly higher doses may provide improved response rates.",Excluded

AIMS: To compare the DNA repair capabilities of the entomopathogenic fungus (EPF) bassiana to the EPF Beauveria brongniartii, Beauveria nivea, Metarhizium anisopliae, Paecilomyces farinosus, Verticillium lecanii, and the fungi Aspergillus niger and Neurospora crassa.METHODS AND RESULTS: Germination of B. bassiana conidiospores following ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was used to show that nucleotide excision repair and photoreactivation decrease the post-UV germination delay. These two modes of repair were characterized and compared between the aforementioned EPF, A. niger and N. crassa using a physiological assay where per cent survival post-UV irradiation was scored as colony forming units.CONCLUSIONS: The results showed B. bassiana and M. anisopliae are the most UV-tolerant EPF. The DNA repair capabilities indicated that EPF do not have all DNA repair options available to fungi, such as A. niger and N. crassa.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A key factor detrimental to the survival of EPF in agro-ecosystems is UV light from solar radiation. The EPF literature pertaining to UV irradiation is varied with respect to methodology, UV source, and dose, which prevented comparisons. Here we have characterized the fungi by a standard method and established the repair capabilities of EPF under optimal conditions.",Excluded
922,"A dosimetric comparison between Gamma Knife and CyberKnife treatment plans for trigeminal neuralgia. OBJECT: The Leksell Gamma Knife and the Accuray CyberKnife systems have been used in the radio surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The 2 techniques use different delivery methods and different treatment parameters. In the past, CyberKnife treatments have been associated with an increased incidence of treatment-related complications, such as facial numbness. The goal of this study was to develop a method for planning a CyberKnife treatment for trigeminal neuralgia that would reproduce the dosimetric characteristics of a Gamma Knife plan. A comparison between Gamma Knife and CyberKnife treatment plans obtained with this method is presented.METHODS: Five patients treated using the Gamma Knife Perfexion Unit were selected for this study. All patients underwent CT cisternography to accurately identify the position of the trigeminal nerve. The Gamma Knife plans used either one 4-mm-diameter collimator or two coincident 4-mm collimators (one open and one with sector blocking) placed at identical isocenter coordinates. A maximum local dose of 80 Gy was prescribed. Critical structures and representative isodose lines were outlined in GammaPlan and exported to the CyberKnife treatment planning platform. CyberKnife treatments were developed using the 5-mm-diameter cone and the trigeminal node set, which provides an effective collimation diameter of 4 mm at the isocenter. The 60-Gy isodose volume imported from GammaPlan was used as the target in the CyberKnife plans. The CyberKnife treatments were optimized to achieve target dose and critical structure sparing similar to the Gamma Knife plans. Isocentric and nonisocentric delivery techniques were investigated. Treatment plans were compared in terms of dosimetric characteristics, delivery, and planning efficiency.RESULTS: CyberKnife treatments using the 5-mm cone and the trigeminal node set can closely reproduce the dose distribution of Gamma Knife plans. CyberKnife isocentric and nonisocentric plans provide comparable results. The average length of the trigeminal nerve receiving a dose of 60 Gy was 4.5, 4.5, and 4.4 mm for Gamma Knife, nonisocentric CyberKnife, and isocentric CyberKnife, respectively. However, minimizing the dose to the critical structures was more difficult with the CyberKnife and required the use of tuning structures. In addition, the dose fall off away from the target was steeper in Gamma Knife plans, probably due to the larger number of beams (192 beams for perfexion vs ~ 100 beams for cyberknife). While the treatment time with the cyberknife is generally shorter, the planning time is significantly longer.CONCLUSIONS: CyberKnife radiosurgical parameters can be optimized to mimic the dose distribution of Gamma Knife plans. However, Gamma Knife plans result in superior sparing of critical structures (brainstem, temporal lobe,and cranial nerves VII and VIII) and in steeper dose fall off away from the target. The clinical significance of these effects is unknown. (DOI: 10.3171/2010.8.GKS101002)",Excluded
347,"Radiation inactivation studies of the dopamine reuptake transporter protein. Using radiation inactivation, we have estimated the target size for the neuronal dopamine transporter protein. The specific binding of several radioligands previously shown to label the dopamine transporter was determined in an irradiated striatal membrane preparation. The apparent target size of the 1-[1-(2-[3H]benzo[b]thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine site was approximately 98 kDa. However, the apparent target size of the ""cocaine binding site,"" as measured with the cocaine analogue 2 beta-[3H]carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane in the same assays, was approximately 140 kDa. Radiation inactivation of the binding of other ligands (GBR-12935 and mazindol) led to target size estimates in the same range (94 kDa and 133 kDa, respectively). All of these target sizes are significantly larger than the estimate of 70 kDa derived from the deduced amino acid sequence for the cloned dopamine reuptake transporter cDNA. Larger target sizes than expected have also been reported for ligand binding to the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and glucose transporter. The estimated sizes for the ligand binding site(s) associated with the dopamine transporter protein are difficult to reconcile with a single transporter protein of 70 kDa. We conclude that the dopamine transporter protein is a homo- or hetero-oligomer when occupied in situ by uptake-blocking drugs like cocaine.",Excluded

834,"Long-term depression is not modulated by ATP receptors in the rat CA1 hippocampal region. ATP is an important extracellular messenger in the CNS. In the hippocampus, a brain structure relevant for learning and memory processes, it acts both as a modulator and as a mediator of synaptic transmission, with implications for synaptic plasticity phenomena. Recent evidence suggests that ATP modulates activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. However, it remains unclear if ATP also modulates LTP counterpart's phenomenon, long-term depression (LTD), in the rat hippocampus. This study investigated the effect of ATP analogues on homosynaptic LTD, induced by low-frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals (1 Hz; 900 pulses) in the CA1 region of young rat hippocampal slices. The metabolically stable ATP analogues beta,gamma-ImATP (20 microM), a P2 receptor agonist, and alpha,beta-MeATP (20 microM), a preferential P2X(1,3) receptor agonist, did not modify LTD (LTD values of 14.7+/-0.5% and 14.1+/-3% for aCSF controls and of 15.1+/-4% and 19.0+/-5.2% for beta,gamma-ImATP and alpha,beta-MeATP, respectively). The ATP analogue beta,gamma-ImATP (20 microM) did not modify LTD also in the presence of the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (50 nM) (21.5+/-4.2% for DPCPX only and of 23.8+/-8.9% for DPCPX plus beta,gamma-ImATP). Finally, the preferential P2X(1,3) receptor antagonist NF023 (10 microM) had also no effect on LTD (18.6+/-5.2% for aCSF and of 18.7+/-5.2% for NF023). The present results suggest that ATP does not modulate activity-dependent homosynaptic LTD in the rat CA1 hippocampal region by activating P2 receptors.",Excluded

Under hypothermia, the protein-synthesizing system was shown to be damaged to a lesser degree and to be restored faster in comparison with similar neurons in rats irradiated at room temperature. In rats irradiated under hypothermia, the rRNA biogenesis and the protein-synthesizing activity of polyribosomes were restored in two days. The protective influence of hypothermia did not spread to changes in membrane structures (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgy apparatus); i.e., a partial loss of integrity and possible transformation of their structure caused by the irradiation and the restoration of these structures occurred at a lower rate.",Included
312,"Synapses in the fly motion-vision pathway: evidence for a broad range of signal amplitudes and dynamics. Synapses are generally considered to operate efficiently only when their signaling range matches the spectrum of prevailing presynaptic signals in terms of both amplitudes and dynamics. However, the prerequisites for optimally matching the signaling ranges may differ between spike-mediated and graded synaptic transmission. This poses a problem for synapses that convey both graded and spike signals at the same time. We addressed this issue by tracing transmission systematically in vivo in the blowfly's visual-motion pathway by recording from single neurons that receive mixed potential signals consisting of rather slow graded fluctuations superimposed with highly variable spikes from a small number of presynaptic elements. Both pre- and postsynaptic neurons were previously shown to represent preferred-direction motion velocity reliably and linearly at low fluctuation frequencies. To selectively assess the performance of individual synapses and to precisely control presynaptic signals, we voltage clamped one of the presynaptic neurons. Results showed that synapses can effectively convey signals over a much larger amplitude and frequency range than is normally used during graded transmission of visual signals. An explanation for this unexpected finding might lie in the transmission of the spike component that reaches larger amplitudes and contains higher frequencies than graded signals.",Excluded
822,"The possibility of surgery for small cell lung cancer (state of art). [Hungarian]. The author provides information about epidemiology as well as surgical practice for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in Hungary. It is emphasized that, based on the author's experience and on international consensus, TNM system is the basis of accurate oncological treatment. The oncological management of SCLC is summarized, which is based on surgery. SCLC, especially cases undergoing surgery, are often detected as a peripheral nodule which should be examined preoperatively by special algorithm. Despite the published favorable results, surgical treatment alone is not accepted nowadays as a correct oncological point of view. The aim of adjuvant therapy is to improve survival and to decrease local recurrence. The 5-year survival of SCLC according to stages is between 4 and 60%. After the late 80's, the complex multimodality oncotherapy has started, with neoadjuvant treatment. SCLC is chemosensitive, even at N2 stage after down-staging surgery might be available. The late results show 20-46% cumulative 5-year survival rate. However, in the case of N2 disease, only 15-30% 5-year survival is achieved. This is a critical question for surgery of SCLC, because the dominant opinion is that for N2 disease and especially residual N2 surgery does not prolong survival. SCLC often occurs in combination with NSCLC. Therefore, salvage operation is a possible choice to remove the residual chemo/radiation resistant SCLC and NSCLC components. In conclusion, surgery has an advantage for SCLC therapy especially in patients with stage I-II disease. Value of surgery for stage III/a disease is under discussion and it is not recommended in Hungarian practice. To use a complex neoadjuvant protocol is advised which provides from 20 up to 40% five-year survival rate.",Excluded
725,"miR-34a in Neurophysiology and Neuropathology. Epigenetic influence of brain and neuronal function plays key regulatory roles in health and diseases. The microRNA miR-34a is a tumor suppressor transcript, and its loss has been prominently linked to various human cancers, including malignancies of the brain. Interestingly, miR-34a is abundantly expressed in the adult mammalian brain, and emerging evidence has implicated its involvement in a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropathological processes. Developmentally, miR-34a regulates neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation and aspects of neurogenesis. During aging, its elevation is connected to hearing loss and age-related macular degeneration. Pathologically, its elevations during epileptic seizures and ischemic stroke contribute to neuronal injury and death. Inhibition or suppression of miR-34a improved neuronal survival against a variety of neurotoxins implicated in Parkinson's disease. Its elevation may also play a role in neuronal demise in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, and suppression of its levels may be generally neuroprotective. The roles and activities of miR-34a in the brain are modulated by factors that control its expression (such as Tp53/73), as well as its downstream target genes (such as the sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6) and signaling pathways (such the Notch pathway).

743,"Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007. What do we currently know about the occupational and environmental causes of cancer? As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know.

611,"Neural circuits underlying circadian behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Circadian clocks include control systems for organizing daily behavior. Such a system consists of a time-keeping mechanism (the clock or pacemaker), input pathways for entraining the clock, and output pathways for producing overt rhythms in behavior and physiology. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in mammals, neural circuits play vital roles in all three functional subdivisions of the circadian system. Regarding the pacemaker, multiple clock neurons, each with cell-autonomous pacemaker capability, are coupled to each other in a network. The outputs of different sets of clock neurons in this network combine to produce the normal bimodal pattern of locomotor activity observed in Drosophila. Regarding input, multiple sensory modalities (including light, temperature, and pheromones) use their own circuitry to entrain the clock. Regarding output, distinct circuits are likely involved for controlling the timing of eclosion and for generating the locomotor activity rhythms. This review summarizes work on all of these circadian circuits, and discusses the broader utility of studying the fly's circadian system. [References: 118]",Excluded

PURPOSE: To investigate how the multifocal electroretinogram (ERG) is altered in conditions of blocking, light scattering, or distortion of the stimulus that are seen in ocular pathologies.METHODS: A central 40 degree-diameter stimulus pattern consisting of 61 hexagons was presented on a cathode ray tube monitor at a rate of 75 Hz according to the pseudo-random binary M sequence by the Veris computer program. Localized responses corresponding to each hexagon and ERG topographies were displayed on the computer screen. Central scotoma was simulated by blocking the central area of the stimulus, visual field constriction by blocking the outer area of the stimulus, mild cataract by using acrylic filters that caused light scatter, and epiretinal membrane by using a wavy plastic plate that produced metamorphopsia.RESULTS: The responses from the blocked area were nonrecordable whether blockage was central or peripheral; responses from the adjacent unblocked area had a larger amplitude when large areas of the stimulus were blocked. The light scatter that decreased vision from 20/20 to 20/70 did not significantly decrease response amplitudes. Responses from areas in which the stimulus pattern was distorted were minimally affected.CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the system records local ERGs from the macula and outside the macula. It can detect the area where the stimulus is blocked. Moderate light scattering and distortion do not cause loss of local ERG characteristics.",Excluded

Paired associative stimulation (PAS) refers to a paradigm consisting of slow-rate repetitive low-frequency median nerve stimulation combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the contralateral motor cortex. This protocol has been shown to induce plastic changes of excitability in the human motor cortex. Its principles of design were shaped after associative long-term potentiation (LTP) in experimental animals, a cellular mechanism likely to be relevant for learning and memory. PAS-induced changes of cortical excitability share a number of physiological properties with LTP. Of particular importance is the fact that the sign of PAS-induced changes of the size of amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) depends on the exact interval between the afferent and the magnetic pulse during the intervention. A number of observations suggest that PAS-induced excitability changes may have functional significance. PAS-induced plasticity may contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis of neurological disorders where neuroplasticity is thought to have a pathogenetic role. Finally, PAS-induced plasticity may itself have therapeutic potential. [References: 16]",Excluded

Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective cohort study within a provincial linked database of 5718 cardiac patients with thorax and head or neck cancer having undergone radiotherapy between 2000 and 2011. One thousand five hundred fifty-two patients were identified as nonstatin users and 4166 as statin users. The primary outcome of interest was the composite of cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attack, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) or cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction). Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed. The crude event rate was 10.31% for nonusers and 9.03% for statin users (hazard ratio of 0.92 [95% CI 0.76-1.10, P=0.3451]), over a mean time to event/censoring of 534+/-687 days for nonusers and 594+/-706 days for the statin users. After adjusting for age, sex, prior history of stroke/transient ischemic attack or myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and hypertension, statin use postradiotherapy was associated with a nonsignificant 15% relative risk reduction, but a strong trend toward reducing the primary outcome (hazard ratio=0.85 95% CI 0.69-1.04, P=0.0811).

502,"ADC texture--an imaging biomarker for high-grade glioma?. PURPOSE: Survival for high-grade gliomas is poor, at least partly explained by intratumoral heterogeneity contributing to treatment resistance. Radiological evaluation of treatment response is in most cases limited to assessment of tumor size months after the initiation of therapy. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its estimate of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been widely investigated, as it reflects tumor cellularity and proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate texture analysis of ADC images in conjunction with multivariate image analysis as a means for identification of pretreatment imaging biomarkers.METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive high-grade glioma patients were treated with radiotherapy (2 Gy/60 Gy) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. ADC maps and T1-weighted anatomical images with and without contrast enhancement were collected prior to treatment, and (residual) tumor contrast enhancement was delineated. A gray-level co-occurrence matrix analysis was performed on the ADC maps in a cuboid encapsulating the tumor in coronal, sagittal, and transversal planes, giving a total of 60 textural descriptors for each tumor. In addition, similar examinations and analyses were performed at day 1, week 2, and week 6 into treatment. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality of the data, and the five largest components (scores) were used in subsequent analyses. MRI assessment three months after completion of radiochemotherapy was used for classifying tumor progression or regression.RESULTS: The score scatter plots revealed that the first, third, and fifth components of the pretreatment examinations exhibited a pattern that strongly correlated to survival. Two groups could be identified: one with a median survival after diagnosis of 1099 days and one with 345 days, p = 0.0001.CONCLUSIONS: By combining PCA and texture analysis, ADC texture characteristics were identified, which seems to hold pretreatment prognostic information, independent of known prognostic factors such as age, stage, and surgical procedure.

648,"Characterization of structurally distinct, isoform-selective phosphoinositide 3'-kinase inhibitors in combination with radiation in the treatment of glioblastoma. The phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling pathway plays a key role in fundamental cellular functions important in normal cellular homeostasis and malignant transformation. Deregulated signaling through this pathway contributes to development of gliomas and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway has thus emerged as a promising approach to successful treatment of gliomas. We assessed the radiosensitizing potential of four small-molecule inhibitors that differ in their activities against specific isoforms of the PI3K 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). p110alpha inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of both protein kinase B/Akt and S6 in all cell lines examined, effectively decreased cellular proliferation, and produced additive cytotoxic effects in combination with radiation therapy. The p110beta inhibitor exhibited limited biochemical effects and failed to decrease cellular proliferation or viability as either a single agent or in combination with radiation or rapamycin. In vivo studies examining the effects of the p110alpha inhibitor in combination with radiation indicated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate induced by the combined treatment compared with each treatment modality alone. This translated into a trend toward prolonged time-to-failure for mice in the combination treatment group.

Since sequential/maintenance chemotherapy has shown promising results in advanced NSCLC, we carried out the study to explore the role of sequential chemotherapy combined with brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases.METHODS: Treatment naive NSCLC patients with brain metastases sequentially received the 3 chemotherapy regimens TP-NP-GP. The TP regimen consisted of Paclitaxol 175 mg/m(2) d1, Cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) d1-5. The NP regimen consisted of Nevalbine 25 mg/m(2) d1 and 8, Cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) d1-5. The GP regimen consisted of Gemcitabine 1 g/m(2) d1 and 8, Cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) d1-5. All regimens were repeated every 3 weeks. Each regimen was executed for at least 2 cycles and no more than 4 cycles.RESULTS: The response rates of TP, NP and GP sequentially used were 41.2%, 35.6% and 27.8% respectively for the out brain lesions and 60.8% for the brain lesions combining with brain irradiation. Median survival time was 14.7 months and the 1, 2 and 3 year overall survivals were 67.8%, 20.6% and 1.3% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The 3rd generation regimen-based sequential chemotherapy combined with WBRT was effective for NSCLC patients with brain metastasis with an encouraging survival and acceptable tolerability.",Excluded
644,"Locus coeruleus activation by foot shock or electrical stimulation inhibits amygdala neurons. The noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) has a direct projection to the basal lateral amygdala (BLA). Behavioral, lesion and pharmacological studies suggest that this pathway has an important role in mediating responses to emotional stimuli and in the formation of long term memory. The effect of LC activation on the activity of BLA neurons in vivo is not known. Therefore, in the present experiments, simultaneous extracellular unit recordings were made in the two regions while the anesthetized rat received electrical stimulation of the paw to simulate a real-life acute stressor, commonly used as an aversive reinforcer in conditioning experiments. All LC neurons exhibited a multiphasic excitatory response followed by prolonged inhibition. Responses of BLA cells were more heterogeneous, but predominantly inhibitory, with a release from inhibition during the refractory phase of LC. Direct electrical stimulation of the LC with a single pulse also elicited an inhibitory response in BLA. BLA response to both footshock and LC stimulation was partially blocked by the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, timolol, infused into the BLA. These experiments are the first to report in vivo effects of activation of the noradrenergic system on neuronal activity in the BLA.",Excluded

O6-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (OMMT) is a DNA repair protein that plays an important role in chemotherapy, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. The sp. act. of OMMT in rat liver can be induced by approximately 12- to 20-fold by treatment of the rats with ionizing radiation. The effects of dose and time were investigated in this study. We have found that OMMT sp. act. can be increased, although to a lower extent, in kidney, spleen and brain in addition to liver. However, the sp. act. of OMMT in lung was reduced by irradiation. OMMT has been purified from the livers of irradiated rats by solubilization in high-salt-containing buffer, ammonium sulfate precipitation and a series of column chromatographic steps, including phenyl-Sepharose, heparin-agarose, double-stranded DNA-cellulose and FPLC. A 3000-fold enrichment of OMMT was achieved from the induced liver preparations.

336,"Melatonin receptor density in Area X of European starlings is correlated with reproductive state and is unaffected by plasma melatonin concentration. Several of the song control nuclei of songbirds, including HVc (higher vocal center) and Area X, contain melatonin receptor (MelR). In laboratory-housed male starlings, the densities of MelR in Area X change markedly according to reproductive state. MelR are down-regulated when starlings are photostimulated (in full breeding condition) and are subsequently up-regulated when starlings become photorefractory (reproductively quiescent). However, seasonal regulation of MelR densities in Area X has only been investigated during the light phase of the light:dark cycle. Variation in MelR densities are physiologically relevant only if they also occur during the dark phase, when melatonin is present in the circulation. Brains from male starlings that were in different reproductive states but exposed to the same 18L:6D photoperiod were collected during either the mid-point of the light phase or the dark phase. Melatonin receptor distribution was assessed in vitro by 125Iodomelatonin (IMEL) receptor autoradiography. All photostimulated birds exhibited down-regulation of MelR in Area X, and all photorefractory birds exhibited high MelR density in Area X, regardless of time of sampling or plasma melatonin concentration. Thus, within each reproductive state, MelR density in Area X did not differ over the course of a circadian cycle. The functional significance of seasonal regulation of MelR in this song control nucleus remains unclear, but it is likely to involve a release of cellular inhibition by melatonin during photostimulation, with possible consequences for song learning, memory consolidation or regulation of the context of song production.",Excluded

There was no premonitory clinical history of cerebrovascular attacks. Autopsy showed unilateral thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery unassociated with neoplastic or fibrotic annular constriction of the vessel. There was medial thickening and fibroblastic proliferation within the carotid artery. Areas of focal elastic membrane degeneration involved the cervical portions of the carotid. Thrombus was organized to the damaged vessel wall and was propagated into the intracranial vessels. Aneurysm formation and arterial hemorrhages were absent. These vascular changes occurred in an area of extensive radiation (7200 rads).

The effect of short days or timed melatonin treatments on the number and neuroanatomical location of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons was studied in the brain of the pubertal male Djungarian hamster. At the beginning of the rapid phase of testicular growth and onset of peak gonadotropin secretion (15 days of age), males were treated for 10 days with either short days (10 L:14 D; n = 6), or remained in long days (16 L:8 D; n = 5) and injected each afternoon with melatonin. These treatments arrested testicular growth compared to the gonadal development that occurred in long-day controls (n = 9). Every brain section (60 microns) from the olfactory bulb to the anterior hypothalamus was processed for GnRH immunocytochemistry and viewed under brightfield light microscopy. GnRH cell bodies had smooth contours and were morphologically bipolar or unipolar. The number of bipolar neurons was similar regardless of treatment (about 170/brain). However, fewer unipolar GnRH cell bodies (p less than 0.05) were found in males in short days (73 +/- 11) or in males administered melatonin (72 +/- 14) compared to the unipolar number in hamsters in long days (132 +/- 14). With respect to neuroanatomical distribution, significantly fewer unipolar GnRH neurons were found in the medial preoptic area of males treated with short days or melatonin (55-70% decrease) compared to cell numbers in long-day controls.

It is a slow-progressing chronic indolent disease characterized by atypical T-cells with a cerebral nucleus. Management of this disease depends on the stage and is based essentially on the systemic treatment. Radiotherapy intervenes in case of localized or extended tumor, indeed, the radiosensibility of this tumor, like any other hematological affection, makes it possible to obtain a high rate of response. Clinical case: we report the observation of a 46-year-old patient followed since 2012 for mycosis fungoid revealed by a papullo-squamous lesion located at the level of the right lumbar fossa. The diagnosis was confirmed by cutaneous biopsy, showing the presence of T lymphocytes expressing CD2, CD3, CD4, CCR4, CD45RO markers. Initial assessment included a thoraco-abdominal pelvic CT, which was normal, an accelerated sedimentation rate at the 1<sup>st</sup> hour, a high C reactive protein (CRP), the electrolytic, renal, hepatic status and the hemogram were normal. Patient received 6 courses of chemotherapy according to the COPP protocol with a decrease in the size of the lesion estimated at 40%. A norm fractionated radiation therapy was delivered at the dose of 36Gy. The evolution was marked by a complete remission, maintained after 6 months of the treatment. Mycosis fungoid is a rare disease, whose management must be discussed in a multidisciplinary team.

1158,"Dietary instead of pharmacological management to counter the adverse effects of physiological adaptations to space flight. The development of pharmacological counter-measures to the adverse effects of physiological adaptation to microgravity has received relatively more attention than alternatives such as dietary management. The manipulation of dietary cation-anion balance, and its subsequent effects on acid-base metabolism, have been routinely used for some time in managing domestic animal health. More recently, dietary intake by humans of alkalinizing potassium salts has been demonstrated to exert profound beneficial effects on calcium balance, bone mineralization, predisposition to calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, and overall nitrogen balance. Dietary sodium restriction has also been shown to improve calcium balance, bone mineralization, and the effectiveness of neurohumoral defenses against orthostatic hypotension. It is proposed that these simple alterations in the astronauts' diets may be easily implemented to lessen the adverse effects of physiological adaptations to space flight, and to enhance or even replace prescribed pharmacological counter-measures.

349,"Understanding and tackling differing vascular niches in glioma. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most belligerent adult brain tumor, which is defined by its aggressive growth due to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, diffuse infiltration and invasion, propensity for necrosis and hypoxia, and vigorous angiogenesis. Recurrence of these invasive tumors is inevitable despite advanced multimodal therapy with surgery followed by radiation and temozolomide treatment resulting in a dismal median survival of beyond one year. A recent milestone in glioma research has been the revelation that therapies targeting other cell types besides tumor cells; i.e., the cell constituents of the vascular niche can convey substantial improvements in radiographic response, progression-free survival, and quality of life. The changing perspective on the environment as a functional contributor represents a profound shift in the approach to biology and therapeutic decisions in GBM.

Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a practical technique which is sensitive to veins, especially tiny veins. Our purpose of this study was to evaluate the visualization of the venous network of brainstem by using SWI at 3.0 T. Method(s): The occurrence rate of each superficial veins of brainstem was evaluated by using SWI on a 3 T MR imaging system in 60 volunteers. The diameter of the lateral mesencephalic vein and peduncular vein were measured by SWI using the reconstructed mIP images in the sagittal view. And the outflow of the veins of brainstem were studied and described according to the reconstructed images. Result(s): The median anterior pontomesencephalic vein, median anterior medullary vein, peduncular vein, right vein of the pontomesencephalic sulcus, and right lateral anterior pontomesencephalic vein were detected in all the subjects (100 %). The outer diameter of peduncular vein was 1.38 +/- 0.26 mm (range 0.8-1.8 mm). The lateral mesencephalic vein was found in 75 % of the subjects and the mean outer diameter was 0.81 +/- 0.2 mm (range 0.5-1.2 mm). The inner veins of mesencephalon were found by using SWI.

Sixty-three patients entered the study between January, 1973 and July, 1976, 30 patients received neutron and 33 received X-ray therapy. The overall mean survival was 11.4 months for those who received photon and 10 months for those who received neutron therapy. Survival rates at 6 and 12 months were 72% and 36%, respectively for photon treated patients, and 77% and 30% for those treated with neutrons. Although neutron therapy did not improve overall survival, examination of the histologic material indicated a considerably greater antitumor effect after neutron therapy than after treatment with photons. In the neutron treated group, at postmortem examination no tumor or only minimal tumor was found in 10 of 12 patients and in one of 4 patients where tissue was obtained from a second craniotomy.

371,"More movement with evaluating colonic transit in humans. BACKGROUND: Colonic functions (ie, absorption of fluids and electrolytes, digestion of selected nutrients, harbor for microbes, and elimination of excreta) necessitate complex patterns of storage and transit. Indeed, colonic transit accounts for a major part of the mouth-to-anus transit time. Colonic transit assessments are useful for understanding the pathophysiology of disease, the pharmacodynamic effects of new medications and to diagnose slow transit constipation. Currently, radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, and a colonic pH-pressure capsule are used to measure overall colonic transit. Radioopaque markers, scintigraphy, and the electromagnetic capsule, which is a newer technique, also evaluate regional colonic transit. The pH-pressure capsule also measures colonic pressures. Magnetic resonance imaging and a radio-frequency identification-based device are evolving methods for assessing colonic transit.PURPOSE: This mini-review, which accompanies a study evaluating the assessment of colon transit with the electromagnetic capsule, evaluates and compares existing and evolving methods for evaluating colonic transit in humans (Neurogastroenterol Motil. 2018; in press). In addition to overall and regional colonic transit, the electromagnetic capsule evaluates colonic motor patterns without radiation exposure. These patterns are summarized by analyzing the characteristics (ie, distance and velocity) of discrete antegrade and retrograde capsule movements as they travel in the colon. However, the electromagnetic capsule does not measure pressure or colonic wall movement (ie, contractions). The motor patterns identified by this capsule should be compared with motor patterns identified with manometry. The next challenge is to harness different techniques to evaluate the relationships between colonic pressures and transit or, even better, the trifecta of colonic contractions, pressure events, and transit.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Cervical pedicle screws are advantageous in their biomechanical stability within cervical and cervicothoracic constructs. The seventh cervical vertebra contains relatively large pedicles and has a low incidence of vertebral artery localization within the transverse foramina. The freehand technique of pedicle screw insertion is advantageous in decreasing intraoperative radiation exposure both to the patient and surgeon. In this study, we investigated the safety and accuracy of C7 pedicle screw placement at our institution utilizing an anatomic freehand technique.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was performed, and 20 patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria over a five-year period (2013-2018). The C7 pedicle screw placement capability and accuracy were recorded. Accuracy was graded based upon postoperative imaging on a Grade 0-3 scale for breach assessment. Any neurologic complications related to screw placement were also recorded.RESULTS: Successful pedicle screw placement occurred in 90% of attempts (36/40). The overall screw accuracy rate was 89% (32/36). There were four minor breaches (Grade 1) identified on CT, without neurologic complications. The fusion rate in our cohort for patients with follow up greater than eight months was 100%.CONCLUSIONS: In our patient series, the freehand technique of C7 pedicle screw placement utilizing a small laminotomy with direct pedicle palpation appears to be a safe and accurate method for screw placement, and provides adequate biomechanical stability for cervical and cervicothoracic construct fusion.",Excluded

Patients with female gender, advanced stage, completion of treatments within 1 year, higher levels of depression, more severe trismus and higher symptom severity tended to have malnutrition or were at risk of malnutrition. Trismus and xerostomia are long-term problems in some NPC survivors and may contribute to malnutrition.

427,"Other dementias. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of degenerative dementia in elderly people after Alzheimer's disease (AD), with approximately 10-15% of dementia cases at autopsy demonstrating the presence of Lewy body pathology [1]. In Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia is a common outcome in up to 80% of patients with PD who will eventually develop dementia as their disease progresses [2, 3]. DLB and PD can be grouped under the umbrella term of Lewy body disease (LBD) due to the overlap in symptom profile, similar response to treatment and the common underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation neuropathology [4]. Together DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) represent an important disease group in older age, with significant health and social impacts. LBD patients display marked deficits in executive and visuo-spatial/visuo-perceptual function, as well as marked variations in their level of arousal and attention which are known as cognitive fluctuations [5-8]. LBD clinical features also include spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism [6], and nonmotor manifestations including symptoms such as visual hallucinations, autonomic dysfunction, syncope, repeated falls, REM sleep behaviour disorder, delusions and depression [6]. However, there are a number of important diagnostic challenges. For example, the differentiation of DLB from Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be difficult, particularly in the early stages of disease when core DLB symptoms may be less evident [9]. Similarly, discrimination between PD, PD or DLB with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, MCI-DLB) and PDD can be problematic as the development of cognitive impairment is often insidious and appears at a variable time after PD diagnosis [10]. There are also a number of treatment challenges. Profound cholinergic deficits occur in the LBDs, even more than in AD [11]. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors may have cognitive and neuropsychiatric benefits including improvements in global cognitive function, attentional function and activities of daily living [12]. However, there are frequently variations in treatment response [13]. The development of novel therapeutics is required, but this process has been hampered by the lack of LBD biomarkers which are sensitive to treatment response. In summary, therefore, there is a clear need to develop LBD biomarkers in order to facilitate early and differential diagnosis (during the prodromal phase of disease); improve our understanding of disease progression; provide a means to monitor therapeutic response; pave the way for early disease-modifying interventions. Existing biomarkers include a range of clinical, biochemical, genetic, proteomic, and, in particular, neuroimaging biomarkers [17, 18]. Generally the utility of these biomarkers has only been supported in a research context aside from dopamine transporter imaging, which due to its high specificity in differentiating LBD from AD [19] is now considered the gold standard for in vivo differential diagnosis between LBD and AD. However FP-CIT remains expensive, has a radioactive exposure and provides little or no information on the disease progression, prognosis, or correlation with cognitive/behavioural symptom severity. Biomarkers should ideally be inexpensive, non-invasive, simple to use and technically validated [20]. In this regard, neurophysiological measures, and in particular electroencephalography (EEG), are currently undergoing a renaissance as potential biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation has been shown to reduce neointimal formation after balloon angioplasty in experimental models of restenosis. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of intracoronary radiation therapy (ICRT) after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for preventing restenosis in human coronary arteries.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22 arteries) with unstable angina underwent standard balloon angioplasty. ICRT was performed with the use of an 192Ir source wire that was hand delivered to the angioplasty site. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 24 hours, between 30 and 60 days, and at 6 months. Angioplasty was successful in 19 of 22 lesions, and insertion of the radioactive source wire was successful at all treated sites. Angiographic study at 24 hours demonstrated early late loss of the luminal diameter from 1.92+/-0.55 to 1.40+/-0.27 mm. Between 30 and 60 days, repeat angiography demonstrated total occlusion in 2 arteries, a new pseudoaneurysm in 1 artery, and significant dilatation at the treatment site in 2 additional vessels. At > or = 6 months' follow-up, all remaining arteries (n=20) maintained patent, with a mean lumen diameter of 1.65+/-0.8 mm. The calculated late lumen loss was 0.27+/-0.56 mm, and the late loss index was 0.19. Clinical events at 1 year included myocardial infarction in 1 patient, repeat angioplasty to the treated site in 3 patients, and persistent angina in 7 patients.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate that ICRT after coronary intervention is feasible and is associated with an acceptable degree of complications and lower rates of angiographic restenosis indexes.",Excluded

65,"Models of bystander signalling between primary astrocytes and glioma cells: Effects on survival and migration/invasion. INTRODUCTION: The goal of radiotherapy is to cause cell death in the targeted tumour field and minimize toxicity to the surrounding normal tissue. However, malignant gliomas are highly resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Recent data suggest migration/invasion is up-regulated as a counterproductive effect of IR. In addition to direct IR effects, non-targeted radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE), observed beyond the targeted field, can cause significant cell death of the tumour and surrounding normal tissues. Little is known of how RIBE modulates glioma migration/invasion. METHOD(S): RIBE of 10 astrocytes and glioma cells grown as single and cocultures in 2D (monolayer) and 3D matrices was investigated, using media transferred from irradiated cultures and in half-exposed/shielded cultures. Nuclear 53BP1 foci were used as a surrogateDNA damage marker and transwell assays to quantitate migration/invasion. Two3D models were developed to study gliospheres in: (i) collagen matrices with/without astrocytes and (ii) mouse brain slice cultures. RESULT(S): RIBE signals from IR and non-IR glioma cultures both decreased astrocyte clonogenic survival.Weobserved increased DNA damage in astrocyte and glioma bystander cells in 2D and 3D cultures. Bystander cells had increased p38-MAPK, Connexin 43, and COX-2signalling. Direct IR induced an increase and RIBE a decrease in transwell migration. Experiments of gliosphere migration/invasion in 3D models are underway. CONCLUSION(S): These results may have implications for tumour-normal tissue margin interactions. By comparing differential molecular factors involved in the RIBE, we aim to find targets to enhance glioma cell death and inhibit migration/invasion, while preserving normal tissue.",Excluded
233,"NAD(+) maintenance attenuates light induced photoreceptor degeneration. Light-induced retinal damage (LD) occurs after surgery or sun exposure. We previously showed that zinc (Zn(2+)) accumulated in photoreceptors and RPE cells after LD but prior to cell death, and pyruvate or nicotinamide attenuated the resultant death perhaps by restoring nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) levels. We first examined the levels of NAD(+) and the efficacy of pyruvate or nicotinamide in oxidative toxicities using primary retinal cultures. We next manipulated NAD(+) levels in vivo and tested the affect on LD to photoreceptors and RPE. NAD(+) levels cycle with a 24-h rhythm in mammals, which is affected by the feeding schedule. Therefore, we tested the affect of increasing NAD(+) levels on LD by giving nicotinamide, inverting the feeding schedule, or using transgenic mice which overexpress cytoplasmic nicotinamide mononucleotide adenyl-transferase-1 (cytNMNAT1), an NAD(+) synthetic enzyme. Zn(2+) accumulation was also assessed in culture and in retinal sections. Retinas of light damaged animals were examined by OCT and plastic sectioning, and retinal NAD(+) levels were measured. Day fed, or nicotinamide treated rats showed less NAD(+) loss, and LD compared to night fed rats or untreated rats without changing the Zn(2+) staining pattern. CytNMNAT1 showed less Zn(2+) staining, NAD(+) loss, and cell death after LD. In conclusion, intense light, Zn(2+) and oxidative toxicities caused an increase in Zn(2+), NAD(+) loss, and cell death which were attenuated by NAD(+) restoration. Therefore, NAD(+) levels play a protective role in LD-induced death of photoreceptors and RPE cells.",Excluded
654,"Gut flora-targeted photobiomodulation therapy improves senile dementia in an As-induced Alzheimer's disease animal model. BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy is believed to have a positive regulatory effect on the imbalance of certain body functions, including inflammation, immunity, wound healing, nerve repair, and pain. Previous studies have found that the intestinal flora of patients with AD is in an unbalanced state. Therefore, we have proposed the use of gut flora-targeted PBM (gf-targeted PBM) as a method to improve AD in an As-induced AD mouse model.METHODS: PBM was performed on the abdomen of the mice at the wavelengths of 630 nm, 730 nm, and 850 nm at 100 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for 8 weeks. Morris water maze test, immunofluorescence and proteomic of hippocampus, and intestinal flora detection of fecal were used to evaluate the treatment effects of gf-targeted PBM on AD rats.RESULTS: PBM at all three wavelengths (especially 630 nm and 730 nm) significantly improved learning retention as measured by the Morris water maze. In addition, we found reduced amyloidosis and tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus by immunofluorescence in AD mice. By using a quantitative proteomic analysis of the hippocampus, we found that gf-targeted PBM significantly altered the expression levels of 509 proteins (the same differentially expressed proteins in all three wavelengths of PBM), which involved the pathways of hormone synthesis, phagocytosis, and metabolism. The 16 s rRNA gene sequencing of fecal contents showed that PBM significantly altered the diversity and abundance of intestinal flora. Specifically, PBM treatment reversed the typical increase of Helicobacter and uncultured Bacteroidales and the decrease of Rikenella seen in AD mice.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that gf-targeted PBM regulates the diversity of intestinal flora, which may improve damage caused by AD. Gf-targeted PBM has the potential to be a noninvasive microflora regulation method for AD patients.",Excluded
431,"Impact of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer: Single center experience. Purpose/Objective: to report the clinical outcome and toxicity of patients affected by nasopharyngeal cancer treated with different radiotherapy (RT) techniques, namely 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Material(s) and Method(s): between January 2000 and December 2013, 82 patients underwent concomitant chemo-radiation with curative intent. By January 2007, IMRT was clinically available at our department and became preferentially adopted in place of 3DCRT. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from first day of treatment to progressive disease or death from any cause; overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from first day of treatment to death from any cause. Acute and late toxicities were retrospectively evaluated according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0) and LENT SOMA scale, respectively. Result(s): Fifty-one patients (62.2%) were treated with 3DCRT while 31 with IMRT (37.8%). The median age of patients was 52.4 years. The majority of patients (54; 65.8%) were diagnosed with loco-regional advanced disease: 35 (42.6%) were in stage IVA/IVB disease and 19 (23.1%) in stage III, respectively. Sixty-four patients (78%) were treated with a conventionally-fractionated, 7 weeks RT regimen delivered in a sequential approach: 50 Gy were delivered to sites deemed at low risk of microscopic infiltration, 60 Gy to macroscopic uninvolved sites but deemed at high risk of disease presence or relapse, 70 Gy to tumor and involved nodal clinical target volumes (CTV's). In 18 patients (22%) the IMRT technique allowed the simultaneous delivery of different doses per fraction, namely 1.8 Gy, 2 Gy and 2.2 Gy aimed at the same volumes described above within a shorter overall treatment time (30 fractions delivered in 6 weeks). The majority of patients (62; 75.6%) received cisplatin-based, concomitant chemotherapy: a 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> three-weekly schedule was administered to 34 of them (56%) while the rest (28; 44%) received a 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly schedule. Twenty patients (24.3%) of the whole cohort diagnosed with very advanced tumors infiltrating neurological structures were given induction chemotherapy (cisplatin-5 fluorouracil or cisplatin- 5 fluoruracil-docetaxel regimens) before concomitant chemoradiation. Twenty patients (24.3%), mostly affected by stage I and II N0 disease, or unfit to receive chemotherapy, were treated with radiotherapy alone. In terms of clinical outcome, the 30-month PFS was 69.6%; progressive disease was diagnosed in 25 patients (30.4%), among them 18 treated with 3DCRT and 7 with IMRT. The first site of failure was distant in 12 (48%) cases and loco-regional in 13 (52%). In terms of OS, at a median follow-up of 51 months, 47 patients (57.3%) were alive. Regarding acute toxicity, the most frequent adverse event was severe (G3-G4) mucositis which was diagnosed in 17 patients in the 3DCRT group (33.3%) and in 8 in the IMRT group (25.8%). The 12-month xerostomia of moderate-severe intensity (G2-G3) was also more frequently found in the 3DCRT cohort than in the IMRT one (31.3% and 10% of patients, respectively). Conclusion(s): our retrospective, single-center experience supports the positive impact of technology evolution of RT techniques from 3DCRT to IMRT in the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer in terms of reduced toxicity and, potentially, improved quality of life.",Excluded
63,"Effect of short-duration spaceflight on thigh and leg muscle volume. PURPOSE: Human skeletal muscle probably atrophies as a result of spaceflight, but few studies have examined this issue. Thus, little is known about the influence of microgravity upon human skeletal muscle, nor is it possible to assess the validity of ground based models of spaceflight. This study tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of spaceflight induced muscle atrophy would be a function of flight duration and greater than that of bed rest.METHODS: Three astronauts flew 9, 15, and 16 d in space. Volume of the knee extensor (quadriceps femoris), knee flexor (hamstrings, sartorius, and gracilis), and plantar flexor (triceps surae) muscle groups was measured using magnetic resonance imaging before and after spaceflight and during recovery. The volume of each muscle group in each image was determined by multiplying cross-sectional area by slice thickness. These values were subsequently summed to calculate muscle volume.RESULTS: Volume changes in the knee extensor, knee flexor, and plantar flexor muscle groups ranged from -15.4 to -5.5, -14.1 to -5.6, and -8.8 to -15.9%, respectively. Muscle volume decreases normalized by flight duration ranged from 0.62 to 1.04% x d(-1). These relative changes appeared to be greater than those that we have reported previously for bed rest (Akima et al., J. Gravitat. Physiol. 4:15-22, 1997).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that atrophy as a result of at least 2 wk of spaceflight varied among individuals and muscle groups and that the degree of atrophy appeared to be greater than that induced by 20 d of bed rest.",Excluded
945,"Copper-induced conformational changes in the N-terminal domain of the Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase. The Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase plays a critical role in the intracellular trafficking of copper. Mutations in this protein lead to the accumulation of a toxic level of copper in the liver, kidney, and brain followed by extensive tissue damage and death. The ATPase has a novel amino-terminal domain ( approximately 70 kDa) which contains six repeats of the copper binding motif GMTCXXC. We have expressed and characterized this domain with respect to the copper binding sites and the conformational consequences of copper binding. A detailed analysis of this domain by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has revealed that each binding site ligates copper in the +1 oxidation state using two cysteine side chains with distorted linear geometry. Analysis of copper-induced conformational changes in the amino-terminal domain indicates that both secondary and tertiary structure changes take place upon copper binding. These copper-induced conformational changes could play an important role in the function and regulation of the ATPase in vivo. In addition to providing important insights on copper binding to the protein, these results suggest a possible mechanism of copper trafficking by the Wilson disease ATPase.",Excluded

Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC was first proposed in 1973 and is recommended for patients demonstrating good response to initial therapy. The general pattern of care amongst radiation oncologists in Germany has not been previously evaluated.We conceptualized and conducted this survey to assess patterns of care. Method(s): We surveyed radiation oncology institutions in Germany via an online questionnaire sent by e-mail to member institutions of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO e.V.). The questions were based on respondent and treatment characteristics with emphasis on prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited- and extensive-stage SCLC. Result(s):We receivedatotal of95responses (29%response rate). Of which 64were completed and returned and hence eligible for evaluation. Sixty-one percent of respondents were between the ages of 50-59, 88%with over 15 years of experience in the management of lungmalignancies. Sixtysevenpercent of the institutions stage theirpatients initially with 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Of the 64 responses, 97% recommended deliveryofPCI in therapy responders with LS-SCLC compared to 67% with ES-SCLC. Interestingly, a quarter of respondents offered hippocampal-avoidance PCI with only 38% following their patients with serial brain imaging followingPCI.Neuropsychological testingwas generally not routinely performed. Conclusion(s): German radiation oncology institutions showed interesting variations in certain aspects yet in general congruence in SCLC management and PCI delivery in accordance with the updated national and international guidelines. Future randomized clinical trials will further reduce discrepancies regarding delivery of PCI especially in ES-SCLC.",Excluded
319,"Effect of low dose radiation on cognition, cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status. Radiation exposure has multiple effects on the brain, behaviour and cognitive functions. These changes depend largely on the dose received and time. While high radiation doses can cause severe tissue destruction, lower doses can induce cognitive impairments without signs of overt tissue damage. Radiation-induced cognitive impairments are reported to occur in up to 50-90% of adult brain tumour patients who survive more than 6 months post-irradiation. This study was undertaken to assess the acute effects of low doses of radiation on cognitive functions, serum cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status, 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice received either sham treatment or irradiation (0.5, 1 and 3 Gy) and were tested for the alterations in the normal behaviour within 10 days. And a blood Serotonin and cortisol analysis was carried out using ELISA kits. Results obtained were analysed using one-way ANOVA. There was a significant decline in exploratory activity of mice exposed to 3 Gy and 1 Gy radiation in open field test. We observed a significant decline in spontaneous Percent Alternation indicating the short-term memory loss in 3 Gy and 1 Gy irradiated mice in Y-Maze. 1 and 3 Gy irradiated mice exhibited increased anxiety in EPM. The increased anxiety and memory loss patterns were also seen in 0.5 Gy irradiated mice, but the results were statistically not significant. The changes to cortisol level were in a dose dependent manner and serotonin levels decreased with dose. Total antioxidant levels also showed the decreasing trend with respect to radiation doses, this pattern is similar to the pattern of cognitive decline shown in behaviour analysis suggesting that the antioxidant status maybe co-related to the radiation induced cognitive decline.

222,"Does radiation exposure portend worse postoperative outcomes after cystectomy with urinary diversion for benign indications?. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative radiation exposure is traditionally thought to correlate with increased postoperative complications after cystectomy with urinary diversion (CxUD) for benign indications. We assessed postoperative outcomes among patients who received CxUD, stratified by radiation exposure. METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients undergoing CxUD over a 10 year period encompassed demographics, operative parameters, 30 and 90 day readmission and complications. CxUD for malignant indications and in patients below 18 years of age were excluded. Chi-square and t-test analyses assessed demographics and indications. Complications were measured by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULT(S): Among 103 patients, 39 (38%) had radiation exposure prior to CxUD. Mean age for patients with radiation exposure undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion was significantly higher (69.8 vs 59.7 years, p=0.001). In patients receiving preoperative radiation, 23.1% (9/39) had congestive heart failure (p=0.005). Other preexisting conditions such as diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, renal disease and liver disease were not associated with radiation exposure. Operative time (p=0.861), estimated blood loss (p=0.756) and length of stay (p=0.776) were not associated with radiation exposure. There was a significant correlation between radiation exposure and having a preoperative diagnosis of genitourinary fistulae (p=0.001), neurogenic bladder (p<0.0001) and urethral stricture (p=0.002). Radiation exposure did not correlate to readmission at 30 days (p=0.256) or at 90 days (p=0.576). Ureteroileal strictures requiring interventional radiology procedures were observed in 6 patients (5.8%) and stomal stenosis was seen in 2 patients (1.9%). Neither variable was correlated with radiation exposure (p=0.27 and p=0.265, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): In spite of patients being older with more comorbidities at baseline, patients with preoperative radiation exposure undergoing CxUD for benign indications did not have increased readmission at 30 or 90 days or increased complications postoperatively. Additionally, operative parameters such as surgery time, estimated blood loss and length of stay were similar between radiation and naive patient groups. These findings suggest radiation exposure prior to CxUD may not portend as negative consequences as once thought.",Included
1191,"Randomized, prospective, and controlled clinical trial of pulsed electromagnetic field stimulation for cervical fusion. Background context: Multilevel fusions, the use of allograft bone, and smoking have been associated with an increased risk of nonunion after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation has been shown to increase arthrodesis rates after lumbar spine fusion surgery, but there are minimal data concerning the effect of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. Purpose(s): To determine the efficacy and safety of PEMF stimulation as an adjunct to arthrodesis after ACDF in patients with potential risk factors for nonunion. Study design: A randomized, controlled, prospective multicenter clinical trial. Patient Sample: Three hundred and twenty-three patients with radiographic evidence (computed tomography-myelogram [CT-myelo] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of a compressed cervical nerve root and symptomatic radiculopathy appropriate to the compressed root that had failed to respond to nonoperative management were enrolled in the study. The patients were either smokers (more than one pack per day) and/or were undergoing multilevel fusions. All patients underwent ACDF using the Smith-Robinson technique. Allograft bone and an anterior cervical plate were used in all cases. Outcome measures: Measurements were obtained preoperatively and at each postoperative interval and included neurologic assessment, visual analog scale (VAS) scores for shoulder/arm pain at rest and with activity, SF-12 scores, the neck disability index (NDI), and radiographs (anteroposterior, lateral, and flexion-extension views). Two orthopedic surgeons not otherwise affiliated with the study and blinded to treatment group evaluated the radiographs, as did a blinded radiologist. Adverse events were reported by all patients throughout the study to determine device safety. Method(s): Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those receiving PEMF stimulation after surgery (PEMF group, 163 patients) and those not receiving PEMF stimulation (control group, 160 patients). Postoperative care was otherwise identical. Follow-up was carried out at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Result(s): The PEMF and control groups were comparable with regard to age, gender, race, past medical history, smoking status, and litigation status. Both groups were also comparable in terms of baseline diagnosis (herniated disc, spondylosis, or both) and number of levels operated (one, two, three, or four). At 6 months postoperatively, the PEMF group had a significantly higher fusion rate than the control group (83.6% vs. 68.6%, p=.0065). At 12 months after surgery, the stimulated group had a fusion rate of 92.8% compared with 86.7% for the control group (p=.1129). There were no significant differences between the PEMF and control groups with regard to VAS pain scores, NDI, or SF-12 scores at 6 or 12 months. No significant differences were found in the incidence of adverse events in the groups. Conclusion(s): This is the first randomized, controlled trial that analyzes the effects of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. PEMF stimulation significantly improved the fusion rate at 6 months postoperatively in patients undergoing ACDF with an allograft and an anterior cervical plate, the eligibility criteria being patients who were smokers or had undergone multilevel cervical fusion. At 12 months postoperatively, however, the fusion rate for PEMF patients was not significantly different from that of the control group. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events in the two groups, indicating that the use of PEMF stimulation is safe in this clinical setting. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In the past 20 years of research regarding effects of mobile phone-derived electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on human cognition, attention has been one of the first and most extensively investigated functions. Different domains investigated covered selective, sustained, and divided attention. Here, the most relevant studies on this topic have been reviewed and discussed. A total of 43 studies are reported and summarized: of these, 31 indicated a total absence of statistically significant difference between real and sham signal, 9 showed a partial improvement of attentional performance (mainly increase in speed of performance and/or improvement of accuracy) as a function of real exposure, while the remaining 3 showed inconsistent results (i.e., increased speed in some tasks and slowing in others) or even a worsening in performance (reduced speed and/or deteriorated accuracy). These results are independent of the specific attentional domain investigated. This scenario allows to conclude that there is a substantial lack of evidence about a negative influence of non-ionizing radiations on attention functioning. Nonetheless, published literature is very heterogeneous under the point of view of methodology (type of signal, exposure time, blinding), dosimetry (accurate evaluation of specific absorption rate-SAR or emitted power), and statistical analyses, making arduous a conclusive generalization to everyday life. Some remarks and suggestions regarding future research are proposed.",Excluded
1184,"Radiobiological analysis of tissue responses following radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery provided clinicians the ability to administer high single-doses of radiation to intracranial targets with relative safety. Analysis of clinical outcome from radiosurgery calls into question some of the radiobiological principles that have guided conventional fractionated radiotherapy in the past. The response of the tumor or target tissue being irradiated, as well as the response of the surrounding normal tissue, seems predominantly determined by the tumor or target vasculature. Injury to the tumor or target vasculature appears to contribute to the probability of developing normal tissue complications. Estimations of alpha/beta values from radiosurgical dose-response data consistently yield values that conflict with values from fractionated radiotherapy and with linear-quadratic theory. This indicates that projections from high-dose single-fractions to fractionated dose-equivalents made using the linear-quadratic formula are unreliable. Radiobiological analysis of clinical data from radiosurgery provides models for guiding treatment to achieve desired effects and provide reliable estimates of complications.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate stochastic and deterministic risks associated with neurointerventional procedures for the patient.METHODS: Eight neurovascular interventional procedures were evaluated to determine the entrance skin dose and effective dose for the patient. Dosimetry was done with thermoluminescence dosimeters. The highest dose on the patient's head was recorded as the maximum entrance skin dose. The equivalent dose was obtained by conversion of the dose-area product using published conversion tables.RESULTS: The maximum entrance skin dose varied from 129 to 1335 mGy. The mean effective dose was 1.67 mSv with a range of 0.44 to 3.44 mSv. No deterministic effect has been encountered. Stochastic risk linked to the highest effective dose value was approximately one death by fatal cancer for every 6000 procedures, according to the new International Commission on Radiological Protection coefficient.CONCLUSIONS: Because no deterministic effect has been detected, and stochastic risks were very low, radiation hazard to the patient is a minor consideration in deciding whether to undertake a neurointerventional procedure.",Excluded

An effect of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) on cognition has been suspected but long-term observations are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term cognitive profile and the incidence of dementia in a cohort of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated by STN-DBS. 57 consecutive patients were prospectively assessed by the mean of a neuropsychological battery over 3 years after surgery. Dementia (DSM-IV) and UPDRS I to IV were recorded. 24.5% of patients converted to dementia over 3 years (incidence of 89 of 1,000 per year). This group of patients cognitively continuously worsened over 3 years up to fulfilling dementia criteria (PDD). The rest of the cohort remained cognitively stable (PD) over the whole follow-up. Preoperative differences between PDD and PD included older age (69.2 +/- 5.8 years; 62.6 +/- 8 years), presence of hallucinations and poorer executive score (10.1 +/- 5.9; 5.5 +/- 4.4). The incidence of dementia over 3 years after STN-DBS is similar to the one reported in medically treated patients. The PDD presented preoperative risk factors of developing dementia similar to those described in medically treated patients.

The purpose of our study was to determine the potential of echo planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting subacute radiation induced injury to the normal brain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with brain metastases and three patients with lung cancer underwent cranial irradiation. These patients were subjected to 3D-EPSI and DTI at two time points (pre-radiation, and 1 month post-irradiation). Parametric maps of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated and co-registered to post-contrast T1-weighted images. Normal appearing gray-matter and white-matter regions were compared between the two time points to assess sub-acute effects of radiation using independent sample t-tests.RESULTS: Significantly increased MD (P = .02), Cho/Cr (P = .02) and a trend towards a decrease in NAA/Cr (P = .06) was observed from the hippocampus. Significant decrease in FA (P = .02) from the centrum-semiovale and a significant increase in MD (P = .04) and Cho/Cr (P = .02) from genu of corpus-callosum was also observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that 3D-EPSI and DTI may provide quantitative measures of radiation induced injury to the normal brain.",Excluded

1106,"Stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus provokes the initiation of robust long-term potentiation of the thalamo-cortical input to the barrel field of the adult, freely moving rat. Long-term potentiation in the thalamo-cortical input to the somatosensory cortex barrel field has been reported to be inducible in vitro only during a narrow critical period of the first postnatal week. Here we explored whether this is due to inability of adult synapses to express LTP or lack of appropriate conditions for LTP induction in slice preparations. We recorded thalamo-cortical field potentials (FPs) from the barrel field of chronically prepared adult rats. In the first series, several parameters of conditioning tetanization of thalamus (T) have been tried. Statistically significant LTP of 135-150% relative to the baseline was observed only in rare cases (3/18) so that the mean changes were not statistically significant. In the second series, five trains of 100 Hz stimulation of T were paired with a ""reinforcing"" stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). In most cases (9/13), thalamo-cortical FPs were potentiated. The mean post-tetanic amplitude was 238 +/- 42% (+/- SEM) relative to the baseline (n = 13). The potentiation persisted for >1 h and typically even further increased when tested 24-48 h later. LTP magnitude strongly correlated with the initial paired-pulse ratio (PPR, coefficient of correlation r = 0.98) so that the LTP magnitude was larger (333 +/- 107, n = 6) in cases with PPR > 1.3. The mean PPR tended to decrease after LTP (from 2.05 to 1.65). Altogether the results suggest that LTP is inducible in the thalamo-cortical input to the barrel field of normal adult rats. The dependence of the LTP magnitude upon the initial PPR suggests that inputs with low initial release probability undergo larger LTP. Together with the tendency to a decrease in the PPR this suggests an involvement of presynaptic mechanisms in the maintenance of neocortical LTP.",Excluded

This study had 16 Se-supplemented (0.5 micrograms Se/d) and 16 placebo adult male Wistar rats. One half of the animals (eight Se-supplemented and eight placebos) were irradiated with a single dose of 4.2 Gy from a Co-60 source and sacrificed 7 d after irradiation along with nonirradiated animals and analyzed for Se content determination. The data obtained showed that selenous yeast supplementation increased Se levels in rat tissues (highest increases in hypothalamus, 161%; hind brain, 126%; spleen, 110%; and adrenal gland, 105%). Ionizing radiation induced significant changes in Se content and distribution (decrease in liver, blood, hair, femoral muscle, spleen, and hypothalamus; increase in kidney, testes, adrenal glands, and brain of placebo group). Supplementation with selenous yeast reduces changes in Se content and distribution after irradiation. It seems that the animal tissue susceptibility to oxidative damage may be correlated to their ability to retain Se in tissues.",Included
594,"Impact of wavefront distortion and scattering on 2-photon microscopy in mammalian brain tissue. Two-photon (2P) microscopy is widely used in neuroscience, but the optical properties of brain tissue are poorly understood. We have investigated the effect of brain tissue on the 2P point spread function (PSF2p) by imaging fluorescent beads through living cortical slices. By combining this with measurements of the mean free path of the excitation light, adaptive optics and vector-based modeling that includes phase modulation and scattering, we show that tissue-induced wavefront distortions are the main determinant of enlargement and distortion of the PSF2p at intermediate imaging depths. Furthermore, they generate surrounding lobes that contain more than half of the 2P excitation. These effects reduce the resolution of fine structures and contrast and they, together with scattering, limit 2P excitation. Our results disentangle the contributions of scattering and wavefront distortion in shaping the cortical PSF2p, thereby providing a basis for improved 2P microscopy.",Excluded

The total absorbed radiation doses were equal to or less than 57 cGy. Observed changes in the FTIR spectra represent the damage in the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of nucleic acid, which seem to be connected with modification of bases and sugars, and redistribution of the H-bond network. FTIR data for tumour and gamma-irradiated nucleic acid show some similar features. A great amount of statistical data and good mathematical approaches are needed for the use of these data as diagnostic criteria.",Included
51,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of sarcoma metastasis. Purpose/Objective(s): The role of conventional radiation in the management of sarcoma metastasis to the spine is limited due to its radioresistant nature. However, spinal stereotactic radiosurgery (sSRS) may have a radiobiological advantage given the high dose per fraction. The purpose of this study is to report our experience using sSRS to treat patients with sarcoma metastasis to the spine. Materials/Methods: Thirty-four lesions (17 patients) with sarcoma metastatic to the spine were identified from a large IRB-approved database. Pain relief post-sSRS was prospectively collected using the Brief Pain Inventory. Survival was calculated from date of procedure using Kaplan- Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine the association between clinical factors and pain relief. Result(s): Eligible patients had a median age of 55 years and 56% were female. Median KPS was 85 (range, 60-100) and median clinical follow-up was 7 months (range, 0-58). Location of metastasis included 44% cervical/ thoracic, 35% lumbar, and 21% sacral lesions. Approximately, 12% had cord compression, 32% had epidural compression, and 59% had neural foramen involvement at the time of treatment. Reason for treatment included 53% for pain, 21% for pain and neurological deficits, 1 patient had vertebral compression fracture and the remaining 24% were asymptomatic. Target volume was a median of 71 cc (range, 16-428 cc). Median maximum prescription dose was 16 Gy (range, 14-16 Gy). In terms of prior treatment, 21% of patients had received prior cEBRT, 15% had prior SBRT, 29% had prior surgery, and 21% had received prior hardware. At 6 and 12 months, actuarial survival was 81% and 73%, radiographic control was 66% and 50%, and unadjusted pain control was 65% and 65%, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated that both radiographic failure and pain relief were associated with age, with older patients less likely to have radiographic failure (HR = 0.864, p = 0.0004) and pain relief (HR = 0.929, p = 0.0202). Unadjusted symptom failure was associated with a larger target volume (HR = 1.010, p = 0.0142), prior surgery (HR = 7.353, p = 0.0131), and prior hardware (HR = 4.717, p = 0.0244). Conclusion(s): We report an unadjusted pain control in 65% of sarcoma patients with spinal metastasis. Based on our previously published data and due to the comparatively lower radiographic and pain control rates when compared to other histologies, we recommend increasing the dose beyond 16 Gy for sarcomas.",Excluded

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) on cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma (CSCH) and to analyze the temporal volume change. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 26 CSCH patients who were treated with GKS between 2001 and 2017. Before GKS, 11 patients (42.3%) had cranial neuropathies and 5 patients (19.2%) complained of headache, whereas 10 patients (38.5%) were initially as-ymptomatic. The mean pre-GKS mass volume was 9.3 mL (range, 0.5-31.6 mL), and the margin dose ranged from 13 to 15 Gy according to the mass volume and the proximity to the optic pathway. All cranial neuropathy patients and half of headache patients showed clinical improvement. All 26 patients achieved mass control; remarkable responses (less than 1/3 of the initial mass vol-ume) were shown in 19 patients (73.1%) and moderate responses (more than 1/3 and less than 2/3) in 7 patients (26.9%). The mean final mass volume after GKS was 1.8 mL (range, 0-12.6 mL). The mean mass volume at 6 months after GKS was 45% (range, 5-80%) compared to the mass volume before GKS and 21% (range, 0-70%) at 12 months. The higher radiation dose tended to in-duce more rapid and greater volume reduction. No treatment-related complication was observed during the follow-up period. GKS could be an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for CSCH. GKS induced very rapid volume reduction compared to other benign brain tumors.

872,"Subthreshold K+ channel dynamics interact with stimulus spectrum to influence temporal coding in an auditory brain stem model. Neurons in the auditory brain stem encode signals with exceptional temporal precision. A low-threshold potassium current, IKLT, present in many auditory brain stem structures and thought to enhance temporal encoding, facilitates spike selection of rapid input current transients through an associated dynamic gate. Whether the dynamic nature of IKLT interacts with the timescales in spectrally rich input to influence spike encoding remains unclear. We examine the general influence of IKLT on spike encoding of stochastic stimuli using a pattern classification analysis between spike responses from a ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) model containing IKLT, and the same model with the IKLT dynamics removed. The influence of IKLT on spike encoding depended on the spectral content of the current stimulus such that maximal IKLT influence occurred for stimuli with power concentrated at frequencies low enough (<500 Hz) to allow IKLT activation. Further, broadband stimuli significantly decreased the influence of IKLT on spike encoding, suggesting that broadband stimuli are not well suited for investigating the influence of some dynamic membrane nonlinearities. Finally, pattern classification on spike responses was performed for physiologically realistic conductance stimuli created from various sounds filtered through an auditory nerve (AN) model. Regardless of the sound, the synaptic input arriving at VCN had similar low-pass power spectra, which led to a large influence of IKLT on spike encoding, suggesting that the subthreshold dynamics of IKLT plays a significant role in shaping the response of real auditory brain stem neurons.",Excluded

675,"Single-neuron perturbations reveal feature-specific competition in V1. The computations performed by local neural populations, such as a cortical layer, are typically inferred from anatomical connectivity and observations of neural activity. Here we describe a method-influence mapping-that uses single-neuron perturbations to directly measure how cortical neurons reshape sensory representations. In layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1), we use two-photon optogenetics to trigger action potentials in a targeted neuron and calcium imaging to measure the effect on spiking in neighbouring neurons in awake mice viewing visual stimuli. Excitatory neurons on average suppressed other neurons and had a centre-surround influence profile over anatomical space. A neuron's influence on its neighbour depended on their similarity in activity. Notably, neurons suppressed activity in similarly tuned neurons more than in dissimilarly tuned neurons. In addition, photostimulation reduced the population response, specifically to the targeted neuron's preferred stimulus, by around 2%. Therefore, V1 layer 2/3 performed feature competition, in which a like-suppresses-like motif reduces redundancy in population activity and may assist with inference of the features that underlie sensory input. We anticipate that influence mapping can be extended to investigate computations in other neural populations.",Excluded

1058,"Stereotactic LINAC-radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors: A long-term follow-up of 27 patients. Background: The optimal treatment of glomus jugulare tumors (GJTs) remains controversial. Due to the critical location, microsurgery still provides high treatment-related morbidity and a decreased quality of life. Thus, we performed stereotactical radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of GJTs and evaluated the long-term outcome. Method(s): Between 1991 and 2011, 32 patients with GJTs underwent SRS using a linear accelerator (LINAC) either as primary or salvage therapy. Twenty-seven patients (median age 59.9 years, range 28.7-79.9 years) with a follow-up greater than five years (median 11 years, range 5.3-22.1 years) were selected for retrospective analysis. The median therapeutic single dose applied to the tumor surface was 15 Gy (range 11-20 Gy) and the median tumor volume was 9.5 ml (range 2.8-51 ml). Result(s): Following LINAC-SRS, 10 of 27 patients showed a significant improvement of their previous neurological complaints, whereas 12 patients remained unchanged. Five patients died during follow-up due to old age or other, not treatment-related reasons. MR-imaging showed a partial remission in 12 and a stable disease in 15 patients. No tumor progression was observed. The actuarial overall survival rates after five, ten and 20 years were 100%, 95.2% and 79.4%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic LINAC-Radiosurgery can achieve an excellent long-term tumor control beside a low rate of morbidity in the treatment of GJTs. It should be considered as an alternative therapy regime to surgical resection or fractionated external beam radiation either as primary, adjuvant or salvage therapy.

Background and aims: Epicrania fugax (EF) diagnostic criteria (Appendix of International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-III) point out the appearance of brief pain paroxysms, describing a stable trajectory across the surface of one hemicranium, commencing and terminating in territories of different nerves. Pain radiation may be forward or backward. We aimed to analyse a large series of patients attended in an outpatient headache clinic. Method(s): We systematically included all patients fulfilling criteria from March 2008 to January 2019. We prospectively assessed clinical and demographic characteristics, therapeutic requirements and response. Result(s): We included 87 patients (61 females, 26 males) out of 5980 attended during study period (1.45%). Age at onset was 45.3+/-16.8 years (16-84). 56 cases (64.4%) suffered a forward EF, 28 (32.2%) a backward EF, and in 3 (3.4%) paroxysms described both trajectories. Pain was strictly unilateral in 72 (82.7%) patients whilst in 11 (12.6%) shifted both sides and in 4 (4.6%) presented a sagittal trajectory. Pain quality was mainly described as electric (52, 59.7%), or stabbing (27. 31%) and intensity rated as 6.9+/-1.9 (3-10). In 28 cases (32%) autonomic features appeared (mainly lacrimation).

742,"Characteristics of diarrhoea in 10 008 users of lansoprazole in daily practice: Which co-factors contribute?. Purpose. Diarrhoea is one of the most frequently reported adverse events during proton pump inhibitor use in any setting. Because of the limited available information, this study was set up with the aim of assessing the incidence and characteristics of diarrhoea and to investigate possible associated co-factors in proton pump inhibitor users in daily practice. Methods. Data were used from a prospective, observational study in which 10 008 lansprazole users were followed over time (1994-1998). The study was designed according to the SAMM guidelines. A nested case-control design was used to compare proton pump inhibitor users reporting diarrhoea with those reporting no diarrhoea. Results. The frequency of diarrhoea was 3.7% and the incidence density 10.7 per 1000 patient months of proton pump inhibitor use. The diarrhoea was most commonly loose and occurred on average 4.4 times per day. The analysis of co-factors revealed that patients with concomitant use of oral antibiotics and patients reporting neurological and/or dermatological adverse events, were at risk of developing diarrhoea during proton pomp inhibitor use. Conclusions. In conclusion, diarrhoea was as frequently reported in our study as in clinical trials and observational data of lansoprazole users. We found the concomitant use of oral antibiotics and the reporting of certain other adverse events to be associated with the reporting of diarrhoea during lansoprazole use. Although a relationship with the proton pump inhibitor intake seemed very plausible, we recommend that use of concomitant medicines as a cause of diarrhoea must be taken into consideration in lansoprazole users.

90,"The future of intraoperative neuromonitoring in skull base surgery: Intraoperative flash visual evoked potentials a novel technique aiming to reduce the risk of intraoperative visual pathway injury. Intraoperative optic nerve/chiasmal injury is one the most devastating unexpected outcomes that may happen to patients undergoing endoscopic skull base surgery. Additionally, one of the main goals for most endoscopic skull base surgery is visual improvement, however currently there is limited ability of intraoperative monitoring for the visual pathway. We examine a novel technique which was developed in our center for monitor the visual pathway intraoperatively using continuous flash visual evoked potentials (FVEPs). The FVEPs provide continuous monitoring of the visual pathway including the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic radiation, and visual cortex, as well as retina function. This technique has been developed at the Ottawa Hospital. Intraoperatively left then right eyes were stimulated by goggle light emitting diode (LED) stimulators (3 LEDs on each side, 640 nm peak wavelength, 10 milliseconds pulse width, 3000mCd of luminous intensity was reflected back on an angle to give uniform illumination across the whole lens, which was placed over the closed eyelids, and recording was obtained from corkscrew electrodes placed at Oz-Fz (2 cm behind Fz). The stimulus rate was 1.41Hz. 150 stimulus presentations were included in a single average. The low cut filter was <=5 Hz and the high cut filter was 100 Hz with amplifier gain 20,000 or 50,000. The total sweep time was 300 milliseconds. EEG was continuously recorded during the surgery from C4-Fz. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. Also any droop in the FVEP will be examined in relation to any intraoperative events. Any transient FVEP amplitude changes which is caused by electrocautery were excluded from the analysis. Thirty patients who had endoscopic skull base surgery had intraoperative VEP using FVEPs in addition to other neurophysiologic monitoring. Patients demographic data, co-morbidities, diagnosis, surgical approach, length of surgery, MAP, and blood loss during surgery were recorded. All patients' visual acuity and field deficits were evaluated by neuro-ophthalmologist prior to their surgery and within 30 days after their surgery. Surgical anesthesia was maintained by TIVA (Propofol/remifentanil infusion). Changes in anesthetic agents and intraoperative events (e.g., sudden blood loss, use of vasopressors .etc) were timed and recorded. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. We found that FVEP is reproducible throughout surgery and can predict the postsurgical outcome. Additionally, we found that FVEP is transiently affected by different stages of surgery (e.g., traction on optic chiasm, dissection, etc.). Also we found boluses of propofol and electrocautery can artificially affect FVEP.",Excluded

475,"Signaling and apoptosis in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. [Japanese]. Tumor necrosis a (TNF) is a key mediator of many acute injuries to the liver, including alcoholic liver injury, viral hepatitis and ischemia reperfusion injury. Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is an important clinical problem for several organs including brain, heart, kidney, and liver. Hepatic I/R injuries occur during transplantation, liver resection for tumor, and circulatory shock. Possible consequences of hepatic I/R injury include liver failure and/or multi-organ system failures, resulting in morbidity and mortality. Hepatic I/R injury produces two types of cell death, apoptosis and necrosis in hepatocytes and non parenchymal cells. Several intracellular signaling molecules are activated by I/R including NFkB and c-Jun N terminal kinase, (JNK). JNK is phosphorylated and activated by several types of stresses, including stimulation by cytokines, such as TNFalpha and IL-1, and environmental stresses such as radiation and oxidant stress. Substrates for JNK include the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF-2. Recent studies have proposed that activated JNK may also directly affect mitochondria through undefined substrates leading to apoptosis. JNK is strongly induced during warm hepatic I/R injury and during the cold ischemial warm repetition injury of liver transplantation. Using selective JNK inhibitors, we have demonstrated that JNK blockade suppresses liver injury in a rat model of hepatic warm I/R and of hepatic cold ischemia/warm reperfusion.

Our study demonstrates that photomodulation at the endfoot of a single astrocyte led to a 25% increase in the diameter of a neighboring arteriole, which is a crucial factor regulating cerebral microcirculation in downstream capillaries. Two-photon uncaging in the astrocyte soma or endfoot near veins does not show the same effect on microcirculation.

550,"[OA109] Validation of a radio-guided surgery technique based on beta-radiation: Test on ex-vivo specimens. Purpose: A very promising technique for radio-guided surgery (RGS) based on beta-radiation is being developed. The lower background, with respect to the established approach with high penetrant gamma radiation, can allow for a large diffusion of such a technique and extending the RGS to cases with a large uptake of surrounding healthy organs, such as abdominal and brain neoplastic disease or tumor of infancy. Method(s): To validate the beta-RGS feasibility study, tests on ex-vivo specimens of brain meningioma and gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have been performed. These clinical cases were selected between the tumors known to express receptors to a beta-emitting radio-tracer already in use in the clinical routine: <sup>90</sup>Y-labelled DOTATOC. Voluntary patients were enrolled according to the standard uptake value (SUV) and the expected tumor-to-non-tumor ratios (TNR) estimated from PET/CT images after administration of 68 Ga-DOTATOC. All of them gave written informed consent to participate in the clinical trial, already approved by the Ethics Committee. After administration of a low activity (about 2.5 mCi) of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC, the extracted ex-vivo specimens and the healthy tissue around the lesions were examined to assess the correlation between the counting rates measured by the developed beta-detecting probe and the expected 90Y activity. Result(s): All the neoplastic samples were correctly identified. A dependence of the counting rate both on the volume V and on the total activity of the sample were observed. Even injecting as low as 1.4 MBq/kg of radio-tracer, tumor remnants of 0.1 ml would be detectable in few seconds. Conclusion(s): The results of the clinical tests showed the validity of the underlying assumptions and strengthening the feasibility studies already published. Small radiopharmaceutical activity is required to detect a tumor remnant as expected due to the low background rates. The negligible medical staff exposure was also confirmed.

We investigated whether exposure of rat brain to microwaves (MWs) of global system for mobile communication (GSM) induces DNA breaks, changes in chromatin conformation and in gene expression. An exposure installation was used based on a test mobile phone employing a GSM signal at 915 MHz, all standard modulations included, output power level in pulses 2 W, specific absorption rate (SAR) 0.4 mW/g. Rats were exposed or sham exposed to MWs during 2 h. After exposure, cell suspensions were prepared from brain samples, as well as from spleen and thymus. For analysis of gene expression patterns, total RNA was extracted from cerebellum. Changes in chromatin conformation, which are indicative of stress response and genotoxic effects, were measured by the method of anomalous viscosity time dependencies (AVTD). DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Effects of MW exposure were observed on neither conformation of chromatin nor DNA DSBs. Gene expression profiles were obtained by Affymetrix U34 GeneChips representing 8800 rat genes and analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software. In cerebellum from all exposed animals, 11 genes were upregulated in a range of 1.34-2.74 fold and one gene was downregulated 0.48-fold (P < .0025). The induced genes encode proteins with diverse functions including neurotransmitter regulation, blood-brain barrier (BBB), and melatonin production.

942,"Brachytherapy radiation doses to the neurovascular bundles. PURPOSE: To investigate the role of radiation dose to the neurovascular bundles (NVB) in brachytherapy-related impotence.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen Pd-103 or I-125 implant patients were studied. For patients treated with implant alone, the prostate and margin (clinical target volume [CTV]) received a prescription dose of 144 Gy for I-125 or 115 Gy for Pd-103. Two patients received Pd-103 (90 Gy) with 46 Gy supplemental external beam radiation (EBRT). Axial CT images were acquired 2 to 4 hours postoperatively for postimplant dosimetry. Because the NVBs cannot be visualized on CT, NVB calculation points were determined according to previously published anatomic descriptions. Bilateral NVB points were considered to lie posterior-laterally, approximately 2 mm from the prostatic capsule. NVB doses were recorded bilaterally, at 0.5-cm intervals from the prostatic base.RESULTS: For Pd-103, the average NVB doses ranged from 150 Gy to 260 Gy, or 130% to 226% of the prescription dose. For I-125, the average NVB dose ranged from 200 Gy to 325 Gy, or 140% to 225% of the prescription dose. These was no consistent relationship between the NVB dose and the distance from the prostatic base. To examine the possible effect of minor deviations of our calculation points from the true NVB location, we performed NVB calculations at points 2 mm medial or lateral from the NVB calculation point in 8 patients. Doses at these alternate calculation points were comparable, although there was greater variability with small changes in the calculation point if sources were located outside the capsule, near the NVB calculation point. Three patients who developed early postimplant impotence had maximal NVB doses that far exceeded the average values.CONCLUSIONS: In the next few years, we hope to clarify the role of high NVB radiation doses on potency, by correlating NVB dose calculations with a large number of patients enrolled in an ongoing I-125 versus Pd-103 trial for early-stage patients, for whom detailed dosimetric and potency data are being collected prospectively.

Severe nephrotoxity, which has been classified as grade 4-5 based on the ""Common Terminology Criteria on Adverse Events,"" was reported in the range from 0%-14%. There are several risk factors for renal toxicity; patient-related risk factors include older age, preexisting renal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous nephrotoxic chemotherapy, metastatic lesions close to renal parenchyma, and single kidney. There are also treatment-related issues, such as choice of radionuclide, cumulative radiation dose to kidneys, renal radiation dose per cycle, activity administered, number of cycles, and time interval between cycles. In the literature, nephrotoxicity caused by PRRT was documented using different criteria and renal function tests, from serum creatinine level to more accurate and sophisticated methods. Generally, serum creatinine level was used as a measure of kidney function. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation based on serum creatinine was preferred by several authors. Most commonly used formulas for estimation of GFR are ""Modifications of Diet in Renal Disease"" (MDRD) equation and ""Cockcroft-Gault"" formulas. However, more precise methods than creatinine or creatinine clearance are recommended to assess renal function, such as GFR measurements using Tc-99m-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), Cr-51-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), or measurement of Tc-99m-MAG3 clearance, particularly in patients with preexisting risk factors for long-term nephrotoxicity. Proximal tubular reabsorption and interstitial retention of tracers result in excessive renal irradiation. Coinfusion of positively charged amino acids, such as l-lysine and l-arginine, is recommended to decrease the renal retention of the tracers by inhibiting the proximal tubular reabsorption. Furthermore, nephrotoxicity may be reduced by dose fractionation. Patient-specific dosimetric studies showed that renal biological effective dose of <0Gy was safe for patients without any risk factors. A renal threshold value <28Gy was recommended for patients with risk factors. Despite kidney protection, renal function impairment can occur after PRRT, especially in patients with risk factors and high single or cumulative renal absorbed dose. Therefore, patient-specific dosimetry may be helpful in minimizing the renal absorbed dose while maximizing the tumor dose. In addition, close and accurate renal function monitoring using more precise methods, rather than plasma creatinine levels, is essential to diagnose the early renal functional changes and to follow-up the renal function during the treatment.",Excluded
1037,"Single photon emission computed tomography in long-term survivors of adult brain tumours. Sixteen patients with primary brain tumours were examined on average eight years after treatment with surgery or whole brain irradiation using standard clinical assessment, CT, a neuropsychological test battery, and single photon emission CT (SPECT) with 99mTc-exametazime. Seventeen lesions were discovered on inspection of SPECT images, 11 with x-ray CT. Quantitative assessment of tracer uptake compared with 16 matched healthy volunteers was consistent with the presence of lesions. Measurement of uptake in brain regions of the hemisphere not containing the primary tumour still showed significant reductions in patients. This may be due to remote direct effects of the tumour or, more likely, to the whole brain irradiation received. Psychometric performance on most tests was significantly impaired in the patient group and was correlated with abnormalities of tracer uptake to relevant brain regions.",Excluded
379,"[Rotational digital subtraction angiography of carotid bifurcation stenosis]. PURPOSE: A prospective study was designed to evaluate, whether multiplanar imaging with rotational digital subtraction angiography (R-DSA) could improve assessment of carotid artery bifurcation stenosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 45 patients with suspected stenosis of the ICA were examined with DSA in standard projections (0 degree-(45 degrees)-90 degrees) and additional R-DSA of each ICA from 0-90 degrees in 10 degrees steps. We compared imaging quality and degree of stenosis as well as exposure of the patients to radiation and contrast media.RESULTS: 79/82 R-DSA (96%) were suitable for evaluation of stenosis, 58/82 (70%) matched the quality standard of single projection DSA. Specificity and sensitivity of the R-DSA to diagnose high grade ACI stenosis were 100% and 94%, respectively. 7/79 R-DSA revealed a higher and 3/79 a lower degree of stenosis than the corresponding DSA. Regarding the degree of stenosis there was no significant difference between the two modalities (p > 0.05), but R-DSA detected 4 stenoses greater than 60% that were estimated to be lower than 60% by DSA. Radiation dose for R-DSA was equivalent to one DSA run (170 cGycm2). The average amount of contrast media (25 ml) was slightly higher than for 2-3 single-projection DSA (19.8 ml).CONCLUSIONS: R-DSA provides high quality imaging of the carotid bifurcation with multiplanar projections facilitating exact grading of vessel stenosis. The number of cases (n = 2) is to small to judge the value of R-DSA as to (tandem-) stenosis of the distal ICA. Still, diagnostic value and low radiation exposure justify the use of R-DSA as additional series to standard protocols.",Excluded
552,"Fractionated stereotactic-guided radiotherapy in the treatment of pituitary adenomas. [Spanish]. AIMS: To evaluate the survival rates, prognostic factors and adverse events in patients with pituitary adenomas following fractionated stereotactic-guided radiotherapy (FSRT). MATERIAL AND METHODS. Fifty-six patients with pituitary adenomas were treated with FSRT; 23 patients (41.1%) had primary adenomas, 33 had recurrent disease; 24 (42.9%) with non-functional and 32 (57.1%) with functional adenomas. Using conventional fractionation, median total dose administered was 54 Gy (range: 24-56 Gy). RESULTS. The median follow-up was 51 months (range: 9-102) and, at the time of analysis, 49 patients were alive and disease-free, 1 patient was alive with reduced visual acuity and biochemical indications of recurrence, 2 patients had died from the disease and 1 patient had died from unrelated causes. Overall survival was 94% (50/53) and overall local tumour control was 92% (49/53). Univariate analysis indicated hormonal secretion (ACTH) and previous radiotherapy as being statistically significant. Fourteen patients (25%) had minor side-effects during treatment and 3 patients (5.4%) had late-onset events; 2 with optical neuropathy (both patients had other relevant co-existing diseases) and 1 patient had brain necrosis (re-irradiation). CONCLUSION. Fractionated stereotactic-guided radiotherapy is an effective modality for the treatment of pituitary adenomas. Care is required in patients with co-morbidities and/or previously-irradiated recurrent tumour so as to minimise late-onset secondary effects.",Excluded
937,"Human whole body radiation dosimetry for NMDA receptor radioligand CCNS5161. Objectives C-CNS5161 (N-(2-chloro-5-methylthiophenyl)-N'-(3- methylthiophenyl)-N'-[ C]methylguanidine) has been successfully used in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. However, no human dosimetry data has been published. We are planning to use this radiotracer for investigating NMDA receptor function in three categories of subjects: (i) systemic lupus erythematosus; (ii) traumatic brain injury; and (iii) Parkinson's disease. We have, therefore, undertaken PET imaging using <sup>11</sup>C-CNS5161 to measure whole body distribution of this radionuclide and estimate radiation dose to various organs. Methods Dynamic PET studies of the whole body were performed in five normal adult subjects. Regions-of-interest were drawn over the visualized structures. Resultant time-activity curves were generated and used to determine residence times for dosimetry calculations. S-factors were computed using the OLINDA/EXM software for each structure/organ. Results For <sup>11</sup>C-CNS5161, organ doses ranged from 0.0006 to 0.1455 rads/mCi. The critical organ for radiation burden was the lungs with a dose of 0.1455 rads/mCi. Radiation dose to the reproductive and blood forming organs were 0.0086, 0.0006 and 0.0074 rads/mCi for ovaries, testes, and red marrow, respectively. The effective dose equivalent (EDE) was 0.0392 rems/mCi. Conclusions The radiation dosimetry for C-CNS5161 for a standard single injection of 15 mCi will result in an EDE of 0.59 rems and lung dose of 2.18 rads in young normal subjects.",Excluded
242,"Cerebral blood-flow in nonanesthetized rodents as measured by arterial spinlabeling magnetic-resonance imaging following administration of serotoninergic (5-HT2C) agonists. Changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) have been associated with a number of diseases and conditions including aging, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and the maintenance of neuronal network integrity (1, 2, 3). Objective(s): The current study used arterial spin labelling (ASL) MRI to measure CBF in rodents following administration of 5-HT<inf>2C</inf>selective agonists, vabicaserin and metachlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), in non-anesthetized rodents. ASL measures a biological correlate for neuronal activity by quantitatively estimating CBF with comparable sensitivity to [<sup>15</sup>O]H<inf>2</inf>O positron emission tomography (PET), but uses no ionizing radiation, is non-invasive and not restricted by the necessity of an on-site cyclotron (4). Method(s): Male Sprague Dawley rats (300-350g; n=6-10/ group) were used in the present experiment. MRI data was collected using a Bruker 70/30 Biospec magnet. The ASL protocol included a T1-weighted globally pulsed 3' flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery-echo planar imaging (FAIR-EPI) pulse sequence and a 2mm selectiveinversion pulse with coronal orientation in the middle of the brain parenchyma. A baseline acquisition was followed by additional acquisitions at 10 and 30 minutes post dose (i.p.) with vehicle (0.9% saline 1ml/kg); vabicaserin (30mg/ ml/kg) or mCPP (3mg/ml/kg). Heart and respiration rates were continuously monitored during the scans. ASL data was processed with the Bruker-ParaVision ASL analysis software. Statistical significance was calculated with GraphPad Prism using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison post-test. Telemetry data was collected using Dataquest A.R.T. acquisition and analysis system that allows monitoring physiologic data from conscious, freely moving animals. Result(s): Compared to baseline, both vabicaserin and mCPP caused a significant CBF increase in specific brain regions at 10 minutes following the administration of 5HT2c compounds. At 30 minutes, a CBF increase still trended with both compounds although it was no longer significant. Neither vehicle, vabicaserin, nor mCPP caused a significant change in either heart or respiration rates for the duration of the ASL MRI scan, suggesting that CBF changes could be independent of systemic ones. Further, previous in-house BOLD fMRI following vabicaserin and mCPP administration showed a statistically significant increase in BOLD signal in cortical brain areas, implicit of increased neuronal activity. Previous in-house data with telemeterized rats showed vabicaserin (30mg/kg i.p.) to induce a significant decrease in heart-rate, and a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), hemodynamic changes that lasted for about 6 h. Conclusion(s): Pre-clinically, ASL-MRI data has translational potential to inform on how various factors such as age, disease or therapeutic intervention can affect CBF. The present study was able to measure CBF with ASL without the use of anesthesia. Administration of 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> agonists increased CBF/brain perfusion and are likely associated with changes neuronal activity. The lack of simultaneous changes on systemic measures, heart and respiration rates, suggest this could be a localized 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> mediated effect. Motion is a major confound in ASL-MRI animal experiments. However, motion reducing anesthetics could have an independent effect on CBF (5), confounding interpretation of the data and reducing their translational potential. Future studies with 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> selective antagonist blockade could be used to gauge the magnitude and selectivity of this effect. (Figure Presented).",Excluded

PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to quantitatively define proliferative and infiltrative cell responses after focal 125I irradiation of normal brain, and to determine the effects of an intravenous infusion of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) on those responses.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult beagle dogs were irradiated using high activity 125I sources. Saline (control) or DFMO (150 mg/kg/day) was infused for 18 days starting 2 days before irradiation. At varying times up to 8 weeks after irradiation, brain tissues were collected and the cell responses in and around the focal lesion were quantified. Immunohistochemical stains were used to label astrocytes (GFAP), vascular endothelial cells (Factor VIII), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs; MAC 387) and cells synthesizing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (BrdU). Cellular responses were quantified using a histomorphometric analysis.RESULTS: After radiation alone, cellular events included a substantial acute inflammatory response followed by increased BrdU labeling and progressive increases in numbers of capillaries and astrocytes. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine treatment significantly affected the measured cell responses. As in controls, an early inflammatory response was measured, but after 2 weeks there were more PMNs/unit area than in controls. The onset of measurable BrdU labeling was delayed in DFMO-treated animals, and the magnitude of labeling was significantly reduced. Increases in astrocyte and vessel numbers/mm2 were observed after a 2-week delay. At the site of implant, astrocytes from DFMO-treated dogs were significantly smaller than those from controls.CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial cell proliferation and infiltration in response to interstitial irradiation of normal brain, and these responses are significantly altered by DFMO treatment. Although the precise mechanisms by which DFMO exerts its effects in this model are not known, the results from this study suggest that modification of radiation injury may be possible by manipulating the response of normal cells to injury.",Included
914,"The Influence of Early Measurements Onto the Estimated Kidney Dose in [<sup>177</sup>Lu][DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>]Octreotate Peptide Receptor Radiotherapy of Neuroendocrine Tumors. Purpose: Multiple measurements have been required to estimate the radiation dose to the kidneys resulting from [<sup>177</sup>Lu]DOTATATE therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of early time-point measurement in the renal dose calculation. Procedures: Anterior/posterior whole-body planar scintigraphy images were acquired at approx. 1, 24, 48, and 72 h after administration of [<sup>177</sup>Lu]DOTATATE. Furthermore, we acquired planar 1-bed dynamic recordings in 12 frames (5 min each) during the first hour. We assessed kidney exposure with a three-phase model consisting of a linear increase to the maximum within the initial minutes p.i., followed a bi-exponential decline. This three-phase-model served as reference for evaluating accuracy of dose estimates in 105 kidneys calculated by conventional mono-exponential fitting of the final three and four whole-body images. Result(s): Mean effective half-life times for the reference model were 25.8 +/- 12.0 min and 63.9 +/- 17.6 h, predicting a mean renal dose of 5.7 +/- 2.1 Gy. The effective half-life time was 46.3 +/- 15.4 h for the last four and 63.3 +/- 17.0 h for the last three data points. The mean start of the first whole-body measurement was 1.2 +/- 0.1 h p.i. The ratio of fast to slow phases was 28.1 +/- 23.9 % at this time point, which caused a mean absolute percentage dose deviation of 12.4 % for four data points, compared to 3.1 % for three data points. At a mean time of 2.4 h p.i. (max 5.1 h), the ratio of fast to slow phase declined below 5 %. Conclusion(s): Kinetic analysis of renal uptake using dynamic planar scans from the first hour after injection revealed a fast and a slow washout phase. Although the fast phase did not contribute substantially to the estimated renal dose, it could influence planar measurements performed within the first hours. We found that the presence of two clearance phases can hamper accurate dose estimation based on a single-phase model, resulting in approximately 12.4 % dose underestimation, thus potentially resulting in overtreatment. In the absence of dynamic initial recordings, the first dosimetry measurements should therefore be obtained later than 3-5 h after [<sup>177</sup>Lu]DOTATATE injection. Omitting the early whole-body image reduced the dose estimation error to 3.1 %. Copyright © 2015, World Molecular Imaging Society.",Excluded
577,"The effect of vertical and horizontal symmetry on memory for tactile patterns in late blind individuals. Visual stimuli that exhibit vertical symmetry are easier to remember than stimuli symmetric along other axes, an advantage that extends to the haptic modality as well. Critically, the vertical symmetry memory advantage has not been found in early blind individuals, despite their overall superior memory, as compared with sighted individuals, and the presence of an overall advantage for identifying symmetric over asymmetric patterns. The absence of the vertical axis memory advantage in the early blind may depend on their total lack of visual experience or on the effect of prolonged visual deprivation. To disentangle this issue, in this study, we measured the ability of late blind individuals to remember tactile spatial patterns that were either vertically or horizontally symmetric or asymmetric. Late blind participants showed better memory performance for symmetric patterns. An additional advantage for the vertical axis of symmetry over the horizontal one was reported, but only for patterns presented in the frontal plane. In the horizontal plane, no difference was observed between vertical and horizontal symmetric patterns, due to the latter being recalled particularly well. These results are discussed in terms of the influence of the spatial reference frame adopted during exploration. Overall, our data suggest that prior visual experience is sufficient to drive the vertical symmetry memory advantage, at least when an external reference frame based on geocentric cues (i.e., gravity) is adopted.",Excluded

We studied central cannabinoid CB1 receptors in a schizophrenic patient using the pyrazole derivative AM281 labelled with the positron-emitting nuclide iodine-124. A dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition with simultaneous blood sampling was performed up to 1.5 h post-injection. The classical Logan plot analysis was applied to generate a three-dimensional map of distribution volume (DV). The map was spatially normalised into the Montreal Neurological Institute stereotactic space. Using a volume of interest (VOI) template, mean values of DV were extracted from multiple grey matter regions and white matter (as a reference). As a measure of regional receptor availability, ratios of DV in grey matter to DV in white matter minus one (DVR-1) were calculated. The highest receptor binding was observed in the striatum and the pallidum (DVR-1: 0.35-0.37). Binding in basal ganglia regions was lower on the left than the right side. Moderately high binding was seen in the frontal cortex (0.22), the temporal cortex (0.18) and the cerebellum (0.15). In conclusion, 124I-AM281 PET can be used to reveal areas with prominent CB1 receptor binding. Nevertheless, limited image contrast and relatively high radiation exposure (physical half-life of 124I: 4 days) have to be taken into account. Asymmetric receptor binding may possibly reflect pathologic changes in schizophrenia.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the hormones produced in pituitary gland tumours (TM) following fractionated external irradiation in rats. The TM arose in the course of studies on other questions of radiation effects.METHODS: The left neck and skull base of sixty female Wistar rats, 3 to 4 months of age at the beginning of the external irradiation, were subjected to roentgen rays exposure, fractionated to 2 Grays daily, either up to 20, 40 or 60 Gy. The midline of the neck and skull was always inside the radiation field. The animals were sacrificed either 6 months or 12 months after completion of the randomly assigned irradiation protocol. Five non-irradiated rats served as controls.RESULTS: No TM developed in the non-irradiated animals. Out of 60 irradiated rats 9 developed a pituitary TM (15%). In remnants of the normal adenohypophysis we revealed immunohistochemical reactivity for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In the radiation-induced adenomas, 4 TM were immuno-reactive for TSH, 4 for GH, 2 for PRL, and 2 for FSH. The TM did not react with anti-ACTH and anti-LH (luteinizing hormone) anti-sera.CONCLUSIONS: Obviously, irradiation accelerates the development of pituitary gland adenomas. In this series the TM were predominantly incidental findings at necropsies after pretermed follow-up intervals with a variety of hormone-producing cells. On the other hand, four of nine TM were null adenomas. Necropsies of the brain should be carried out routinely in irradiation studies of the skull.",Included

943,"Cellular Therapies for Treatment of Radiation Injury: Report from a NIH/NIAID and IRSN Workshop. In recent years, there has been increasing concern over the possibility of a radiological or nuclear incident occurring somewhere in the world. Intelligence agencies frequently report that terrorist groups and rogue nations are seeking to obtain radiological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. In addition, there exists the real possibility that safety of nuclear power reactors could be compromised by natural (such as the tsunami and subsequent Fukushima accident in Japan in March, 2011) or accidental (Three Mile Island, 1979 and Chernobyl, 1986) events. Although progress has been made by governments around the world to prepare for these events, including the stockpiling of radiation countermeasures, there are still challenges concerning care of patients injured during a radiation incident. Because the deleterious and pathological effects of radiation are so broad, it is desirable to identify medical countermeasures that can have a beneficial impact on several tissues and organ systems. Cellular therapies have the potential to impact recovery and tissue/organ regeneration for both early and late complications of radiation exposure. These therapies, which could include stem or blood progenitor cells, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or cells derived from other tissues (e.g., endothelium or placenta), have shown great promise in treating other nonradiation injuries to and diseases of the bone marrow, skin, gastrointestinal tract, brain, lung and heart. To explore the potential use of these therapies in the treatment of victims after acute radiation exposure, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases co-sponsored an international workshop in July, 2015 in Paris, France with the Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire. The workshop included discussions of data available from testing in preclinical models of radiation injury to different organs, logistics associated with the practical use of cellular therapies for a mass casualty incident, as well as international regulatory requirements for authorizing such drug products to be legally and readily used in such incidents.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify secreted proteins in the retina of the adult zebrafish that are induced by the selective death of photoreceptors and to test experimentally the function of these proteins during the regeneration of photoreceptors.METHODS: Induced selective death of photoreceptors in the retina of the adult zebrafish was combined with in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to identify the induced cellular expression of the secreted beta-galactoside binding protein Galectin 1-like 2 (Drgal1-L2). Electroporation of morpholino oligonucleotides was used to knock down protein synthesis, and regenerated photoreceptors were counted in control and experimental retinas after labeling with cell type-specific RNA probes.RESULTS: Expression analysis and immunocytochemistry showed that Drgal1-L2 is induced de novo by photoreceptor death and is synthesized by microglia and proliferating Muller glia and their mitotic progeny. Knockdown of Drgal1-L2 expression in Muller glia results in reduced regeneration of rod photoreceptors without affecting injury-induced proliferation or the regeneration of cone photoreceptors.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data, the authors conclude that Drgal1-L2 is induced by photoreceptor cell death and secreted by stem cells and neuronal progenitors and that it regulates the regeneration of rod photoreceptors. Drgal1-L2 is the first secreted factor shown to regulate aspects of regenerative neurogenesis in the teleost retina.",Excluded

Purpose or Objective: The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited disease (LD) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has proven to significantly decrease the incidence of brain metastases (BMs) with only modest improvement of overall survival. Material(s) and Method(s): To evaluate the impact of PCI on survival we reviewed 179 LD SCLC patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the concurrent or sequential setting. PCI was applied in the partial and complete responders exclusively provided contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) before and after primary treatment showed no signs of occult BMs. Correlation between PCI and time to progression (TTP) as well as overall survival (OS) was analysed. Kaplan-Meier analysis, uni- and multivariate Cox regression were used to describe survival within subgroups defined by treatment response and application of PCI. Result(s): Concurrent and sequential chemoradiotherapy CRT was applied in 71 (40%) and 108 (60%) patients, respectively. In 58 (32%) patients metachronous BMs were detected. PCI was applied in 71 (39%) patients. 15 patients developed BMs after PCI. Median TTP and OS in responders treated with PCI were 812 and 801 compared to 355 (range: 284 - 456) (p < 0.0001, log-rank test) and 385 (range: 318 - 452) (p < 0.0001, log-rank test) days in the rest of the patient cohort.

409,"Improving the specificity of R2' to the deoxyhaemoglobin content of brain tissue: Prospective correction of macroscopic magnetic field gradients. The reversible transverse relaxation rate, R2', is sensitive to the deoxyhaemoglobin content of brain tissue, enabling information about the oxygen extraction fraction to be obtained. However, R2' is also sensitive to macroscopic magnetic field gradients, particularly at air-tissue interfaces where a large susceptibility difference is present. It is important that this latter effect is minimised in order to produce meaningful estimates of blood oxygenation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to implement a technique to prospectively correct for the effect of susceptibility induced magnetic field gradients on R2' weighted data. This was achieved by combining the Gradient-Echo Slice Excitation Profile Imaging (GESEPI) technique with an Asymmetric Spin Echo (ASE) pulse sequence. The main advantages of this approach are (i) shorter acquisition times, since a separately acquired magnetic field map is not required and (ii) simpler analysis, since retrospective correction for the effects of magnetic field gradients in postprocessing is not required. In these experiments we show that with this newly developed technique it is possible to correct the majority of grey matter voxels for the expected distribution of through-slice magnetic field gradients to produce maps of R2' in a short scan duration.",Excluded
350,"Characterization of the inflammatory response to solid cancer metastases in the human brain. BACKGROUND: New immunomodulatroy agents, like ipilimumab, showed promising activity in brain metastases (BM). However, little is known about the inflammatory response in BM and new insights are needed to further guide the development of treatment strategies. METHOD(S): We investigated 17 human autoptic tissue specimens of BM from breast cancer (n = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 5), small cell lung cancer (SCLC; n = 3) and melanoma (n = 6). Immunohistochemical staining for a comprehensive panel of 21 inflammation-associated markers was performed. Results were quantified by manual counting of the various cell populations in three areas of 0.5 mm2 (intratumoral, peritumoral, control region). RESULT(S): Profound microglia activation with marked peritumoral accumulation and some intratumoral infiltration of HLA-DR-positive microglia/macrophages was found. A high proportion of these cells showed strong immunoreactivity for phagocytosis associated markers and MHC class 1, while a smaller subgroup of cells expressed molecules involved in radical production (inducible nitric oxide synthase or NADPH oxidases). Only few B- and T-lymphocytes were observed in and around BM. The number of CD8-positive T-cells was not correlated to MHC class 1 expression on microglia/macrophages or tumor cells. Melanoma BM had significantly less dense peritumoral microglia infiltrates than NSCLC BM. The inflammatory pattern was independent from treatment of patients with glucocorticoids or radiation. CONCLUSION(S): Inflammatory reaction to BM is mainly characterized by activation of microglia/macrophages and shows pronounced upregulation of markers involved in phagocytosis, but seems to be insufficient in activating T-cell response. Treatment strategies aimed at activating specific immunity may potentiate immune attack on tumor cells.",Excluded

Objective: To investigate the effect of glioma stem cells in the radioresistance of glioma, and find out potential targets for overcoming radioresistance of malignant glioma. Method(s): Human cerebral glioma stem/progenitor cell line SU-2 and human cerebral glioma cell line U251, SHG-44 were cultured in vitro under stem cell culture conditions. Changes of cell morphology, percentage of Hoechst 33342<sup>-</sup> and CD133<sup>+</sup> cells, tumor cell survival ratio, nude mice tumorigeinity were observed before and after different radiation dosages of linear accelerator. MGMT gene expression levels of human cerebral glioma cell line U251 and human cerebral glioma stem/progenitor cell line SU-2 were assayed by real-time fluorescene quantitative PCR method before and after radiation. Result(s): Over a range of 1-15 Gy radiation, percentage of Hoechst 33342<sup>-</sup> and CD133<sup>+</sup> cells in human cerebral glioma stem/progenitor cell line SU-2 obviously increased to 18.73% and 13.70%, respectively after radiation. Cell survival ratio increased, the tumorigeneity increased to 100% (8/8), invasiveness enhanced, MGMT gene expression level also increased after radiation. Conclusion(s): Glioma stem cells enriched not only in numbers after radiation, their biological characteristics, such as survival ratio, tumorigeneity, invasiveness also increased.

Oral phase swallowing impairment in motor neuron disease (MND) is caused by tongue weakness, fasciculation and atrophy, which may compromise oral transit time and total feeding time. Objective(s): To describe and correlate total oral transit time (TOTT) with functional performance in MND using different food consistencies. Method(s): The study was conducted on 20 patients with MND, regardless of type or duration of the disease, of whom nine were excluded due to issues on the videofluoroscopic swallowing images. The remaining 11 patients (nine men and two women) ranged from 31 to 87 years of age (mean: 57 years) with scores on the Penetration Aspiration Scale ranging from <= 2 to <= 4. The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - revised questionnaire was applied to classify individuals according to global, bulbar and bulbar/respiratory parameters. Videofluoroscopy of swallowing using 5ml of different consistencies was performed and a quantitative temporal analysis of the TOTT was carried out with the aid of specific software. Result(s): There was a wide variation in the TOTT within the same food consistency among MND patients. There was a correlation between the TOTT and overall functional performance for the thickened liquid consistency (r = -0.691) and between the TOTT and bulbar performance for the pureed consistency (r = -0.859). Conclusion(s): Total oral transit time in MND varies within the same food consistency and the longer the TOTT, regardless of food consistency, the lower the functional performance in MND.

105,"Use of non-ablative dose of radiation to enhance delivery of unmodified morpholino oligonucleotides in a brain tumor model to silence mgmt and enhance the efficacy of chemo-radiation. Objective: Non-ablative Ionizing radiation ( XRT) is well known to alter neuro-vascular unit (NVU) permeability. We evaluate the use of XRT to enhance delivery of intravenously administered Morpholino Oligonucleotides designed to silence O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in a MGMT expressing human derived brain tumor xenograft model. Background(s): MGMT, a key DNA repair enzyme is associated with resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). We have previously reported the use of a non-ablative dose of ionizing radiation (XRT) to prime human cancer cells to enhance the uptake of unmodified anti-MGMT morpholino oligonucleotides (AMONs) to achieve statistically significant reduction in the in-vitro proliferation index and cell viability with a single dose of AMONs and TMZ. Our prior work has demonstrated that this is by enlarge mediated by up regulation of physiologic endocytosis after XRT. Design/Methods: Intracranial tumor (MGMT expressing human derived H460 non-small cell lung cancer, n=12) bearing athymic nude rats received a single dose of cranial radiation (2Gy) with oral TMZ for 4 consecutive days starting on the day of XRT. In addition, six animals were randomly selected to receive AMON (10.5mg/kg) 24 hrs after XRT, the remaining served as controls. All animals were euthanized and brains harvested 7 days after XRT and tumor volumes measured by immunoblotting. This experiments was repeated in human derived D283 medulloblastoma xenografts (n=12) Results: A 60% (p=0.034) reduction in MGMT expression was noted in brain tumors treated with XRT and iv AMONs. Although not significant, a 40% reduction in tumors volumes were noted in the animals treated with a single dose of AMONs and chemo-radiation. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate the first use of XRT to guide and enhance delivery of AMONS to brain tumors. In this proof of concept study, silencing MGMT enhances the toxicity of XRT and TMZ. This approach warrants further evaluation and may improve outcomes in patients with tumors with un-methylated MGMT.",Excluded
1178,"A phase II study of a temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy regimen for high-risk low-grade gliomas: Preliminary results of RTOG 0424. Background: The primary endpoint of RTOG 0424 was to compare the 3-year survival (OS) of a regimen of concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy (RT) in a high-risk low-grade glioma (LGG) population to the 3 year (yr) OS rate of the high risk EORTC LGG patients (pts) reported by Pignatti et al (J Clin Oncol 2002;20(8):2076-84).Secondary endpoints were: progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, neurocognitive and quality of life data and molecular analysis. Method(s): Pts with LGG's and >=3 high risk factors (age> = 40, astrocytoma dominant histology, tumor crossing midline, tumor > = 6 cm or preoperative neurological function status >1) were eligible and treated with conformal RT (54 Gy/30 fractions) plus concurrent TMZ 75 mgm<sup>2</sup> /day for 6 weeks and post-RT TMZ 150-200 mgm<sup>2</sup>/day days 1-5 q28 days for up to 12 cycles.

Result(s): Between January 2005-August 2009 136 pts were accrued, 129 (75 males, 54 females) were evaluable. Median age was 49 years, 91% had a Zubrod score 0-1 and 69%, 25% and 6% of pts had 3,4 and 5 high risk factors respectively. With a median follow-up time of 4.1 yrs, minimum follow-up of 3 yrs, MST has not yet been reached. Three year OS rate was 73.1% (95%CI:65.3-80.8%), significantly improved from historical control with a p-value <0.0001. No difference in OS rates for pts with 3, 4 or 5 high risk factors was seen. 3 year PFS was 59.2% (95% CI:50.7-67.8%).

640,"Risk of cerebral metastases and neurological death after pathological complete response to neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer: Clinical implications for the subsequent management of the brain. BACKGROUND. The incidence and pattern of brain metastases was analyzed among patients who achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS. Between 1990 and 2004, 211 patients were treated with neoadjuvant therapy before surgical resection for stage III NSCLC. The clinical course of 51 patients who demonstrated a pCR were reviewed. The neoadjuvant regimen consisted of either chemotherapy (29 patients) or chemoradiotherapy (22 patients). Histology was 45% adenocarcinoma, 41% squamous cell, and 14% large cell carcinoma. No patient received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). RESULTS. Overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82%, 63%, and 42%, respectively. The most common site of initial recurrence was the brain. Twenty-two (43%) patients developed brain metastasis as the site of first failure, which represented 71% of all isolated recurrences. Ultimately, 28 (55%) patients developed brain metastases at some point during their clinical course. The 5-year estimates of brain metastasis-free survival for patients with squamous and nonsquamous cancers were 57% and 34%, respectively (P = .02). Median survival from the time of brain metastasis was 10 and 5 months for those with isolated and nonisolated recurrences, respectively. CONCLUSION. Patients with a pCR after multimodality therapy for locally advanced NSCLC are at excessively high risk for the subsequent development of brain metastases.

508,"Phase II trial of recombinant interferon-alpha-2a and eflornithine in patients with recurrent glioma. Interferons alpha and beta have been reported to cause tumor regression in a small proportion of patients with recurrent glioma. Eflornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, reduces cellular polyamine levels and has also been reported to cause tumor regression in patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme. In vitro evidence suggests that interferon and eflornithine are synergistic. In this phase II trial, we investigated the combination of recombinant alpha interferon (36 x 10(6) units/m2 subcutaneously days 3 to 7) and eflornithine (2.25 g/m2 QID PO days 1 to 7) repeated every 28 days. All 29 patients entered in the study were evaluable for toxicity and efficacy. Toxicity consisted primarily of fever, chills, myalgia, weakness and fatigue as well as cortical dysfunction including somnolence, confusion, and exacerbation of underlying neurologic deficits. One patient died from cerebral herniation attributable to interferon. None of the patients experienced objective tumor regression. Seven patients (24%) were stable for more than six months, but the disease stability could also be explained by indolent underlying disease or inability to distinguish recurrent tumor from delayed radiation effects. Intermittent high-dose recombinant interferon alpha plus eflornithine demonstrated no definite antitumor effects in this trial.",Excluded

However, currently there is no universally recognized dose quantity that can be used to assess and report generalised risks to individuals following whole body exposures in the high-dose range. In this work, a number of potential dose quantities are presented and discussed, with mathematical modelling techniques employed to compare them and explore when their differences are most or least manifest. The results are interpreted to propose the average (D <sub>GRB</sub>) of the absorbed doses to the stomach, small intestine, red bone marrow, and brain as the optimum quantity for informing assessments of risk. A second, maximally conservative dose quantity (D <sub>Max</sub>) is also suggested, which places limits on any under-estimates resulting from the adoption of D <sub>GRB</sub>. The primary aim of this work is to spark debate, with further work required to refine the final choice of quantity or quantities most appropriate for the full range of different potential exposure scenarios.",Excluded
707,"Spatio-temporal analysis of molecular delivery through the blood-brain barrier using focused ultrasound. The deposition of gadolinium through ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings in the murine hippocampus was investigated. First, wave propagation simulations through the intact mouse skull revealed minimal beam distortion while thermal deposition simulations, at the same sonication parameters used to induce BBB opening in vivo, revealed temperature increases lower than 0.5 degrees C. The simulation results were validated experimentally in ex vivo skulls (m = 6) and in vitro tissue specimens. Then, in vivo mice (n = 9) were injected with microbubbles (Optison; 25-50 microl) and sonicated (frequency: 1.525 MHz, pressure amplitudes: 0.5-1.1 MPa, burst duration: 20 ms, duty cycle: 20%, durations: 2-4 shots, 30 s per shot, 30 s interval) at the left hippocampus, through intact skin and skull. Sequential, high-resolution, T1-weighted MRI (9.4 Tesla, in-plane resolution: 75 microm, scan time: 45-180 min) with gadolinium (Omniscan; 0.5 ml) injected intraperitoneally revealed a threshold of the BBB opening at 0.67 MPa and BBB closing within 28 h from opening. The contrast-enhancement area and gadolinium deposition path were monitored over time and the influence of vessel density, size and location was determined. Sonicated arteries, or their immediate surroundings, depicted greater contrast enhancement than sonicated homogeneous brain tissue regions. In conclusion, gadolinium was delivered through a transiently opened BBB and contained to a specific brain region (i.e., the hippocampus) using a single-element focused ultrasound transducer. It was also found that the amount of gadolinium deposited in the hippocampal region increased with the acoustic pressure and that the spatial distribution of the BBB opening was determined not only by the ultrasound beam, but also by the vasculature of the targeted brain region.",Excluded

Stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy after resection of brain metastasis is an alternative to whole brain radiotherapy. A high dose per fraction is associated with a risk of radiation necrosis. We present four cases of confirmed histological radiation necrosis. Differentiating recurrent tumour from radiation necrosis in this scenario is challenging. An enhancing area in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a ""cut bell pepper"" appearance may suggest radiation necrosis. Advanced imaging modalities such as perfusion MR imaging and positron emission tomography can be useful.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of an 80-kVp protocol using a moderate concentration contrast material (MC-CM) for cerebral computed tomography angiography by comparison with a conventional 120-kVp protocol using a high concentration contrast material (HC-CM).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Attenuation values and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were determined in a head phantom for 2 tube voltages (80 and 120 kVp) and 2 different iodine concentration contrast materials (HC-CM and MC-CM). Among 90 consecutive patients, 45 patients were scanned with 120 kVp and 150 mAs(eff) after administration of 70 mL of HC-CM (370 mg iodine [mgI]/mL), whereas the other 45 patients were scanned with 80 kVp and 370 mAs(eff) after administration of 70 mL of MC-CM (300 mgI/mL). The Hounsfield units (HU) of the internal carotid artery T junction, SNR, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), subjective degree of arterial enhancement, image noise, sharpness of the cerebral arterial boundary, and overall diagnostic image quality were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS: The mean attenuation of the internal carotid artery T junction, SNR, and CNR was significantly higher in the 80 kVp with MC-CM group (379.2, 33.7, and 31.1 HU, respectively) than in the 120 kVp with HC-CM group (282.2, 31.1, and 27.2 HU, respectively). The 80-kVp protocol resulted in significantly higher score in arterial enhancement, sharpness of the cerebral arteries, and overall diagnostic image quality. The effective dose of 80 kVp (0.7 mSv) was 22.2% lower than that of 120 kVp (0.9 mSv).CONCLUSIONS: The use of 80 kVp with MC-CM improved arterial enhancement, SNR, and CNR and provided superior quality images using a smaller amount of iodine and a lower radiation dose than the conventional protocol of 120 kVp with HC-CM.",Excluded

941,"The effect of space missions on gravity-responsive torsional eye movements. Three astronauts underwent preflight, inflight, and postflight testing of spontaneous ocular torsion and of ocular counterrolling (OCR), reflexes governed by the gravity-responsive otolith organs in the inner ear. One astronaut, A, had a 30-day space mission on Euromir '94 and was examined monocularly with SensoMotoric Instruments video-oculography (VOG). The other two astronauts, B and C, were studied with a binocular VOG and flew an 180-day mission on Euromir '95. In space, spontaneous eye torsion in the upright position was found to be substantially offset from baseline Earth-based recordings in all three subjects for the duration of the flights. In addition, the binocular studies showed a marked torsional disconjugacy. On return to Earth, offset and torsional disconjugacy persisted for many days. OCR in response to 30 degrees right and left tilt was examined preflight and postflight. Compared to preflight, Astronaut A showed reduced OCR immediately postflight, which increased over the next few days. Both Astronauts B and C had increased OCR postflight, which gradually approached but did not achieve the preflight values over 13 days postflight. The adaptation of ocular torsion in space in one astronaut and not in the other two, and slow adaptation postflight, may reflect the lack of visual feed-back and the open loop nature of the otolith-ocular torsion reflex.",Excluded

PDX respond to treatment by showing a reduced rate of increase in tumor bioluminescence (RT only), or decreased tumor bioluminescence (TMZ only or RT/TMZ), but with eventual tumor growth requiring animal euthanasia at 5.5 (RT only), 26.5 (TMZ only), or 38 (RT/TMZ) days beyond the median survival of untreated control animal subjects. All survival extensions are significant relative to untreated control mice (p<0.05). To examine the effects of treatment on tumor cell subpopulations in intracranial PDX, we employed flow cytometric analyses of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) positive GBM cells, using a panel of markers (CD133, CD15, ABCG2, SOX2, EZH2, HIF1A, MGMT, and H3K27me3). RT alone did not cause a significant enrichment for any specific subpopulation, as identified using the markers indicated above. In contrast, PDX exposed to TMZ monotherapy or RT/TMZ combination therapy showed enrichment for CD133+HIF1A+ cells (p<0.005). PDX treated with RT/TMZ were also enriched for CD133+CD15+, and additionally showed enrichment for CD133+SOX2+ and CD133+EZH2+ cells (p<0.005 for each). Perhaps not so surprisingly, recurrent tumors that had been treated with TMZ or RT/ TMZ showed increased cellular positivity for MGMT (Control 0.78% vs. TMZ 3.4% p<0.005 and RT/TMZ 4.3% p<0.0005), though, paradoxically, these tumors also showed increased cellular positivity for EZH2 (Control 0.38% vs. TMZ 3.0% p=ns and RT/TMZ 7.8% p<0.0005) and a product of EZH2 activity, H3K27me3 (Control 0.55% vs. TMZ 18.2% p<0.0005 and RT/TMZ 4.3% p=ns), which is associated with transcriptional suppression.

Background: Patients with an obstructive subclavian artery (SA) may exhibit symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency known as subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). Endovascular treatment with stent assisted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (SAPTA) demonstrates significantly lower percentage of intraoperative and postoperative complications in comparison with open surgery. There is a 1-5% risk of distal intracranial embolization through the ipsilateral vertebral artery (VA) during SAPTA. Objective(s): To assess the safety and feasibility of a novel technique for distal embolic protection using balloon catheters during SA revascularization with a dual transfemoral and transradial access. Method(s): We describe a case series of patients with SSS who underwent SAPTA due to severe stenosis or occlusion of the SA using a combined anterograde/retrograde approach. Transfemoral access to SA was obtained using large bore guide sheaths. Ipsilateral transradial access was obtained using intermediate bore catheters. A Scepter XC balloon catheter was introduced through the transradial intermediate catheter into the ipsilateral VA at the ostium during SAPTA for distal embolic protection. Result(s): A total of eight patients with SSS underwent subclavian SAPTA. Four patients had the combined anterograde/retrograde approach. Successful revascularization was achieved in three of them. It was difficult to create a channel in the fourth unsuccessful case due to heavily calcified plaque burden. No peri-operative ischemic events were identified. On follow-up, we demonstrated patency of the stents with resolution of symptoms and without any adverse events.

1152,"Clival chordomas: A pathological, surgical, and radiotherapeutic review. Background. The purpose of this study was to discuss the optimal management of patients with clival chordomas and provide an up-to-date review of the field. Methods. A schematic description of the anatomy of the clivus and its surrounding structures is provided based on the modular classification of the surgical corridors used in endoscopic skull base surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) techniques are described. Results. The optimal treatment is gross total resection. Recent advances in endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery have allowed very high rates of macroscopic and radiographic complete tumor resection in spite of the challenging location of these lesions. When the tumor location or extension is too lateral or inferior to be effectively resected with an endoscopic approach, an open approach or a combination of endoscopic and open approaches in stages should be considered. Postoperative RT is usually indicated because the likelihood of recurrence is high in spite of complete surgical resection. The main site of recurrence is local and late recurrences are relatively common. The probability of cure is approximately 50% at 10 years and significantly increases when complete tumor resection has been achieved. Conclusion. The preferred treatment for patients with clival chordoma is gross total resection (via endoscopic endonasal surgery when possible) followed by postoperative RT. Treatment at experienced multidisciplinary cranial base centers is key to minimize complications and to enhance the probability of total removal of the tumors. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Our aim was to analyze the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife (CK) radiosurgery for elderly patients.METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients with brain metastases >= 65 years old treated with CK-SRS at our institution since 2011 and analyzed data of primary diseases, multimodality treatments, and local therapy effect based on imaging follow-up and treatment safety. Kaplan-Meier analysis for local progression-free interval and overall survival were performed.RESULTS: We identified 97 patients (233 lesions) fulfilling the criteria at the first CK-SRS. The mean age was 73.2 +/- 5.8 (range: 65.0-87.0) years. Overall, 13.4% of the patients were > 80 years old. The three most frequent primary cancers were lung (40.2%), kidney (22.7%), and malignant melanoma (15.5%). In 38.5% (47/122 treatments) multiple brain metastases were treated with the CK-SRS, with up to eight lesions in one session. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 1.05 (range: 0.01-19.80) cm<sup>3</sup>. A single fraction was applied in 92.3% of the lesions with a median prescription dose of 19 (range: 12-21) Gy. The estimated overall survivals at 3-, 6-, and 12 months after SRS were 79, 55, and 23%, respectively. The estimated local tumor progression-free intervals at 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 72 months after SRS were 99.2, 89.0, 67.2, 64.6, and 64.6%, respectively. Older age and female sex were predictive factors of local progression. The Karnofsky performance score remained stable in 97.9% of the patients; only one patient developed a neurological deficit after SRS of a cerebellar lesion (ataxia, CTCAE Grade 2).CONCLUSIONS: SRS is a safe and efficient option for the treatment of elderly patients with brain metastases with good local control rates without the side effects of WBRT. Older age and female sex seem to be predictive factors of local progression. Prospective studies are warranted to clarify the role of SRS treatment for elderly patients.",Excluded
1052,"Increasing telomerase in mouse brain by novel compound protects neurons from various insults. Telomerase was shown to protect developing neurons from apoptosis induced by DNA damage or oxidative stress. Hence, we and other hypothesized that increasing telomerase expression by pharmaceutical compounds may protect brain cells. This study demonstrates the ability of a novel compound, AGS, to significantly increase telomerase activity and expression (3 fold) in the mouse brain and to exert neuroprotective effects. Treatment with AGS, prior to NMDA systemic injection, increased the survival and decreased the seizures of NMDA injected mice. AGS treatment also enhanced DNA repair in purkinje neurons following brain irradiation. AGS protective effect is mediated by telomerase expression, since it did not protect motor neuron- like cell line (NSC-34) from oxidative stress when TERT expression was diminished by shRNA or overexpressed. AGS treatment significantly delayed the onset of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in SOD1 Tg mouse model and prolongs their life span (18 day) in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, TERT expression is reduced with the disease progression in the brainstem and spinal cord. We suggest that TERT serves as a surviving enzyme in the CNS both by its canonical telomere stabilization activity and by its non-canonical anti-apoptotic function. Therefore transient increase of telomerase expression and activity by AGS may have a therapeutic effect in neurodegenerative diseases.",Excluded
1138,"The role of edema in diffuse sclerosis and other leukoencephalopathies. The pathologic changes associated with broad zones of demyelination of the cerebral white matter, the diffuse sclerosis group, are analyzed with respect to the contribution of cerebral edema to their pathogenesis. The characteristics of cerebral edema in general are reviewed, and the interpretation offered that only one type of cerebral edema, that characterized by an extracellular accumulation of fluid, occurs in man. In the diffuse sclerosis group, edema is most readily recognized by the tendency for the arcuate zone of white matter to be spared when the deeper white matter is severely degenerated. Edema is demonstrated in metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, disorders of amino acid metabolism, trauma, hypertensive disease, radiation effect, diffuse hypoxia with acidosis, and other conditions, i.e., both in disorders of myelin metabolism and in conditions in which normal myelin is injured by extrinsic influences. These groups cannot be consistently distinguished morphologically, in part because the injury by edema often obscures any primary morphologic change which may have been present. A familial tendency does not necessarily denote a metabolic abnormality specifically related to the chemistry of a myelin constituent, since the lesions might result from edema induced by some other type of familial process. Such familial processes might be metabolic, but are not specifically related to myelin formation or catabolism, as might be true of diseases like phenylketonuria or maple syrup urine disease. Edema may also occur in instances in which a familial disease induces diffuse hypoxia and acidosis, as exemplified by two instances of severe white matter degeneration in subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy; one of these is an additional instance of apparent 'crib death' by this cause.",Excluded
547,"Water permeability of rat liver mitochondria: A biophysical study. The movement of water accompanying solutes between the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial spaces is central for mitochondrial volume homeostasis, an important function for mitochondrial activities and for preventing the deleterious effects of excess matrix swelling or contraction. While the discovery of aquaporin water channels in the inner mitochondrial membrane provided valuable insights into the basis of mitochondrial plasticity, questions regarding the identity of mitochondrial water permeability and its regulatory mechanism remain open. Here, we use a stopped flow light scattering approach to define the water permeability and Arrhenius activation energy of the rat liver whole intact mitochondrion and its membrane subcompartments. The water permeabilities of whole brain and testis mitochondria as well as liposome models of the lipid bilayer composing the liver inner mitochondrial membrane are also characterized. Besides finding remarkably high water permeabilities for both mitochondria and their membrane subcompartments, the existence of additional pathways of water movement other than aquaporins are suggested.",Excluded

103,"Urinary, anorectal and sexual assessment after pelvic cancer surgery. Urinary, anorectal and sexual complications are often observed after pelvic cancer surgery. These symptoms may be secondary to a tumor compression or a specific surgical trauma of autonomic and somatic pathways involved in the bladder, bowel and sexual control. Indeed, pelvic organs are very close and share the same innervation, which plays an important role in the detrusor contraction, erectile function, pelvic floor contraction and global pelvi-perineal sensory functions. Moreover, pelvic irradiation and/or chemotherapy following specific surgery can also lead to neurogenic (myelopathy and plexopathy) lesions of centers and/or motor/sensory pathways, which control bladder and rectal functions. Specific bladder and rectal lesions secondary to irradiation are very common (chronic radiation cystitis, radiation rectitis). Sexual dysfunction from radiation therapy includes erectile dysfunction and vaginal stenosis. Urinary symptoms observed after pelvic surgery are principally characterized by voiding dysfunction with urinary retention or post void residual in case of neurogenic lesion. In some cases, overactive bladder symptoms (urge, frequency) are due to a radiation lesion of the bladder mucosa. Cystoscopy and urodynamic investigations are necessary to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms of these symptoms. Treatment of urinary retention is usually self-intermittent catherization and anticholinergic drugs can be used in case of overactive bladder. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors can be used in male erectile dysfunction and vaginal dilators in case of vaginal stenosis. Perineal pain can be observed. Neurological mechanism is the main mechanism and can be confirmed by means of electrophysiological testing. This neuropathic pain can be managed by various treatments (drugs, TENS. . .).",Excluded
304,"Red light is necessary to activate the reproductive axis in chickens independently of the retina of the eye. Photoperiod is essential in manipulating sexual maturity and reproductive performance in avian species. Light can be perceived by photoreceptors in the retina of the eye, pineal gland, and hypothalamus. However, the relative sensitivity and specificity of each organ to wavelength, and consequently the physiological effects, may differ. The purpose of this experiment was to test the impacts of light wavelengths on reproduction, growth, and stress in laying hens maintained in cages and to determine whether the retina of the eye is necessary. Individual cages in 3 optically isolated sections of a single room were equipped with LED strips providing either pure green, pure red or white light (red, green, and blue) set to 10 lx (hens levels). The involvement of the retina on mediating the effects of light wavelength was assessed by using a naturally blind line (Smoky Joe) of chickens. Red and white lights resulted in higher estradiol concentrations after photostimulation, indicating stronger ovarian activation, which translated into a significantly lower age at first egg when compared with the green light. Similarly, hens maintained under red and white lights had a longer and higher peak production and higher cumulative egg number than hens under green light. No significant difference in BW gain was observed until sexual maturation. However, from 23 wk of age onward, birds exposed to green light showed higher body growth, which may be the result of their lower egg production. Although corticosterone levels were higher at 20 wk of age in hens under red light, concentrations were below levels that can be considered indicative of stress. Because no significant differences were observed between blind and sighted birds maintained under red and white light, the retina of the eye did not participate in the activation of reproduction. In summary, red light was required to stimulate the reproductive axis whereas green light was ineffective, and the effects of stimulatory wavelengths do not appear to require a functional retina of the eye.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Lower limb lymphedema (LLL) is a common condition after pelvic cancer treatment but few studies have evaluated its effect on the quality of life and its consequences on daily life activities among gynecological cancer survivors.METHODS: We identified a cohort of 789 eligible women, treated with pelvic radiotherapy alone or as part of combined treatment of gynecological cancer, from 1991 to 2003 at two departments of gynecological oncology in Sweden. As a preparatory study, we conducted in-depth interviews with gynecological cancer survivors and constructed a study-specific questionnaire which we validated face-to-face. The questionnaire covered physical symptoms originating in the pelvis, demographic, psychological, and quality of life factors. In relation to the lymph system, 19 questions were asked.RESULTS: Six hundred sixteen (78 %) gynecological cancer survivors answered the questionnaire and participated in the study. Thirty-six percent (218/606) of the cancer survivors reported LLL. Overall quality of life was significantly lower among cancer survivors with LLL. They were also less satisfied with their sleep, more worried about recurrence of cancer, and more likely to interpret symptoms from the body as recurrence. Cancer survivors reported that LLL kept them from physical activity (45 %) and house work (29 %) and affected their ability to partake in social activities (27 %) or to meet friends (20 %).CONCLUSION: Lower limb lymphedema has a negative impact on quality of life among gynecological cancer survivors, affecting sleep and daily life activities, yet only a few seek professional help.",Excluded

The mass responded, but granulocytopenia developed. Bone marrow examination showed a myeloid to erythroid ratio of approximately 1:1, with a left shift within the myeloid line. These findings, as well as the lack of toxic changes within the peripheral blood neutrophils, suggested immune-mediated destruction of peripheral granulocytes.

Material(s) and Method(s): An online survey was administered to physicians in the US, UK, Germany, France, Brazil, and Italy to collect data on patients with advanced NET. The survey gathered data on the incidence and frequency of resource use (e.g. chemotherapy, somatostatin analogs [SSA], PRRT). Result(s): Of the 4,100 surveys administered, 197 physicians participated (4.8%), providing data for 394 NET patients. Among all patients, nonpancreatic GI tract was the most common primary site (45.4%), followed by pancreas (30.7%). Resource utilization was high across tumour types as shown in Table 1.

116,Surface recording of orthodromic sensory nerve action potentials in median and ulnar nerves in normal subjects. Reference values of sensory nerve compound action potentials (CAP) were established in 50 healthy subjects by examination with surface electrodes placed in a transverse and a longitudinal position at the wrist. Longitudinal electrodes record potentials of larger amplitude and shorter duration than transversally recorded CAPs. Both amplitude and duration were increased by an increase of interelectrode distance. The use of amplitude and duration as variables is encouraged by the well-defined biologic variation obtained when fixed interelectrode distance is used and when values are corrected for age and temperature. The strong correlation between amplitude and duration might indicate that the decrease of amplitude with age is caused by the reduction of conduction velocity rather than axonal loss. The ulnar nerve CAPs differ from those of the median nerve mostly with regard to influence of age and temperature. The reasons for this are discussed.,Excluded

540,"Calcium-induced calcium release in rod photoreceptor terminals boosts synaptic transmission during maintained depolarization. We examined the contribution of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) to synaptic transmission from rod photoreceptor terminals. Whole-cell recording and confocal calcium imaging experiments were conducted on rods with intact synaptic terminals in a retinal slice preparation from salamander. Low concentrations of ryanodine stimulated calcium increases in rod terminals, consistent with the presence of ryanodine receptors. Application of strong depolarizing steps (-70 to -10 mV) exceeding 200 ms or longer in duration evoked a wave of calcium that spread across the synaptic terminals of voltage-clamped rods. This secondary calcium increase was blocked by high concentrations of ryanodine, indicating it was due to CICR. Ryanodine (50 microm) had no significant effect on rod calcium current (I(ca)) although it slightly diminished rod light-evoked voltage responses. Bath application of 50 microm ryanodine strongly inhibited light-evoked currents in horizontal cells. Whether applied extracellularly or delivered into the rod cell through the patch pipette, ryanodine (50 microm) also inhibited excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked in horizontal cells by depolarizing steps applied to rods. Ryanodine caused a preferential reduction in the later portions of EPSCs evoked by depolarizing steps of 200 ms or longer. These results indicate that CICR enhances calcium increases in rod terminals evoked by sustained depolarization, which in turn acts to boost synaptic exocytosis from rods.",Excluded

Aromatase, the last and obligatory enzyme catalyzing estrogen biosynthesis from androgenic precursors, can be labeled in vivo with <sup>11</sup>C-vorozole. Aromatase inhibitors are widely used in breast cancer and other endocrine conditions. The present study aimed to provide baseline information defining aromatase distribution in healthy men and women, against which its perturbation in pathologic situations can be studied. Method(s): <sup>11</sup>C-vorozole (111-296 MBq/subject) was injected intravenously in 13 men and 20 women (age range, 23-67 y). PET data were acquired over a 90-min period. Each subject had 4 scans, 2 per day separated by 2-6 wk, including brain and torso or pelvis scans. Young women were scanned at 2 discrete phases of the menstrual cycle (midcycle and late luteal). Men and postmenopausal women were also scanned after pretreatment with a clinical dose of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. Time-activity curves were obtained, and standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated for major organs including brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, muscle, bone, and male and female reproductive organs (penis, testes, uterus, ovaries). Organ and whole-body radiation exposures were calculated using OLINDA software. Result(s): Liver uptake was higher than uptake in any other organ but was not blocked by pretreatment with letrozole. Mean SUVs were higher in men than in women, and brain uptake was blocked by letrozole. Male brain SUVs were also higher than SUVs in any other organ (ranging from 0.48 +/- 0.05 in lungs to 1.5 +/- 0.13 in kidneys). Mean ovarian SUVs (3.08 +/- 0.7) were comparable to brain levels and higher than in any other organ. Furthermore, ovarian SUVs in young women around the time of ovulation (midcycle) were significantly higher than those measured in the late luteal phase, whereas aging and cigarette smoking reduced <sup>11</sup>C-vorozole uptake. Conclusion(s): PET with <sup>11</sup>C-vorozole is useful for assessing physiologic changes in estrogen synthesis capacity in the human body. Baseline levels in breasts, lungs, and bones are low, supporting further investigation of this tracer as a new tool for detection of aromatase-overexpressing primary tumors or metastases in these organs and optimization of treatment in cancer and other disorders in which aromatase inhibitors are useful.

1116,"Alpha-Phenyl-n-tert-butyl-nitrone attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced neuronal injury in the neonatal rat brain. Although white matter damage is a fundamental neuropathological feature of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), the motor and cognitive deficits observed later in infants with PVL indicate the possible involvement of cerebral neuronal dysfunction. Using a previously developed rat model of white matter injury induced by cerebral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, we investigated whether LPS exposure also results in neuronal injury in the neonatal brain and whether alpha-phenyl-n-tert-butyl-nitrone (PBN), an antioxidant, offers protection against LPS-induced neuronal injury. A stereotactic intracerebral injection of LPS (1 mg/kg) was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day 5) and control rats were injected with sterile saline. LPS exposure resulted in axonal and neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex as indicated by elevated expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein, altered axonal length and width, and increased size of cortical neuronal nuclei. LPS exposure also caused loss of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental areas of the rat brain. Treatments with PBN (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced LPS-induced neuronal and axonal damage. The protection of PBN was associated with an attenuation of oxidative stress induced by LPS as indicated by the reduced number of 4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde or nitrotyrosine positive cells in the cortical area following LPS exposure, and with the reduction in microglial activation stimulated by LPS. The finding that an inflammatory environment may cause both white matter and neuronal injury in the neonatal brain supports the possible anatomical correlate for the intellectual deficits and the other cortical and deep gray neuronal dysfunctions associated with PVL. The protection of PBN may indicate the potential usefulness of antioxidants for treatment of these neuronal dysfunctions.",Excluded

Astronauts on lengthy voyages will be exposed to an environment of microgravity and ionizing radiation that may have adverse effects on physical abilities, mood, and cognitive functioning. However, little is known about the long-term effects of combined microgravity and low-dose radiation. We exposed mice to gamma radiation using a cobalt-57 plate (0.01 cGy/h for a total dose of 0.04 Gy), hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, or a combination of both for 3 weeks. Mice then underwent a behavioral test battery after 1 week, 1 month, 4 months, and 8 months to assess sensorimotor coordination/balance (rotarod), activity levels (open field), learned helplessness/depression-like behavior (tail suspension test), risk-taking (elevated zero maze), and spatial learning/memory (water maze). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression was assessed in the brain after behavioral testing to determine blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Mice that received unloading spent significantly more time in the exposed portions of the elevated zero maze, were hypoactive in the open field, and spent less time struggling on the tail suspension test than mice that did not receive unloading. Mice in the combination group expressed more AQP4 immunoactivity than controls. Elevated zero maze and AQP4 data were correlated. No differences were seen on the water maze or rotarod, and no radiation-only effects were observed. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to BBB dysfunction.",Included

In addition to this, we assessed whether there is a correlation between intrathecal sICAM-1 production and other disease activity markers such as IgG index and gadolinium enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty four relapsing- remitting MS patients were included in the study. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained both during relapse and remission. The soluble form of ICAM (sICAM) was measured by the ELISA method in serum and CSF. Cranial MRI with triple dose gadolinium injection was performed for each patient both during relapse and remission. Serum levels of sICAM-1 (245.23+/-92.88 ng/ml) were higher during relapse than those in remission (219.90+/-110.94 ng/ml), but the difference was not statistically significant. In relapse periods CSF levels of sICAM-1 (1.304+/-0.92 ng/ml) were higher than those in remission (1.06+/-0.86 ng/ml), but this was not significant. However, during relapse periods patients had significantly higher sICAM-1 index values (1.76+/-0.60) than those found during remission periods (1.01+/-0.44) (p<0.05). The IgG index values were higher in relapse periods than in remission (0.88+/-0.37 vs. 0.67+/-0.28) (p<0.005). On T1 weighted images following triple dose Gd injection, at least two or more enhancing lesions were present in 22/24 of the patients (91 %) in relapse and 4/24 of the patients (19 %) in remission. There was strong correlation both between the sICAM-1 index and Gd enhancement (r=0.72 p<0.05) and sICAM-1 index and IgG index in relapse (r=0.69 p<0.05).

PURPOSE: Major depression and related mood disorders are the most common long-term outcomes associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Given the potentially debilitating consequences of depression, and the fact that TBI patients are frequently refractory to antidepressant drugs, new therapies are clearly needed. We hypothesized that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), delivered intravenously, can effectively treat TBI-induced depression and other behavioral deficits associated with TBI.METHODS: Rats (n = 8 per group) were subjected to experimental TBI or control sham operation. Six hours post TBI, rats were treated with 1x106 hMSC or vehicle control. Immediately after TBI and prior to hMSC or control treatment, rats were subjected to either targeted precision x-ray irradiation to eliminate subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation or sham irradiation. One week after TBI, SVZ irradiation, and hMSC treatment, rats were evaluated for the depression-like behavior, anhedonia, using the two-bottle saccharin preference paradigm; and for working memory using the novel object recognition test.RESULTS: TBI resulted in a 54% (p<=0.05) decrease in saccharin preference scores while treatment of TBI with hMSC fully prevented this anhedonic behavior. TBI was also found to produce a 73% (p<=0.05) decrease in novel object interaction time, indicating impaired working memory, and was similarly improved by treatment with hMSC. The ability of hMSC to prevent TBI-associated depression and working memory impairment was eliminated when SVZ proliferation was inhibited by irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This work has identified a possible role for hMSC in the treatment of TBI-induced depression and other behaviors and suggests a mechanistic role for proliferative cells of the SVZ proliferation in hMSC efficacy.",Excluded

Seventeen patients with glioma WHO grade III-IV treated with FRT were included in this prospective study, seven were excluded because of inconsistent FRT protocol or missing examinations.

Pre-FRT 3D-T1w images were segmented into white- and grey matter. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were calculated and co-registered patient-wise to pre-FRT 3D-T1w images. Seven radiation dose regions were created for each tissue type: 0-5 Gy, 5-10 Gy, 10-20 Gy, 20-30 Gy, 30-40 Gy, 40-50 Gy and 50-60 Gy. Mean CBV and CBF were calculated in each dose region and normalised (nCBV and nCBF) to the mean CBV and CBF in 0-5 Gy white- and grey matter reference regions, respectively. Regional and global nCBV and nCBF in white- and grey matter decreased after FRT, followed by a tendency to recover. The response of nCBV and nCBF was dose-dependent in white matter but not in grey matter. Our data suggest that radiation-induced perfusion changes occur in normal-appearing brain tissue after FRT. This can cause an overestimation of relative tumour perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, and can thus confound tumour treatment evaluation.

By contrast, non-mammalian vertebrates possess many extraocular photoreceptors but in many cases the role of these photoreceptors and their underlying photopigments is unknown. In birds, deep brain photoreceptors have been shown to sense photic changes in daylength (photoperiod) and mediate seasonal reproduction. Nonetheless, the specific identity of the opsin photopigment 'sensor' involved has remained elusive. Previously, we showed that vertebrate ancient (VA) opsin is expressed in avian hypothalamic neurons and forms a photosensitive molecule. However, a direct functional link between VA opsin and the regulation of seasonal biology was absent. Here, we report the in vivo and in vitro absorption spectra (lambda<inf>max</inf>=~490 nm) for chicken VA photopigments. Furthermore, the spectral sensitivity of these photopigments match the peak absorbance of the avian photoperiodic response (lambda<inf>max</inf>=492 nm) and permits maximum photon capture within the restricted light environment of the hypothalamus. Such a correspondence argues strongly that VA opsin plays a key role in regulating seasonal reproduction in birds. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Excluded

Animals that were studied physiologically were killed, and their brains were examined with Nissl staining and immunocytochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase, heat shock protein 72 (HSP-72), parvalbumin, calmodulin, calretinin, calbindin, and somatostatin.RESULTS: Ninety and 130 CGE resulted in decreased performance in the Morris water maze, increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diminished granule cell field potentials, and tissue necrosis, which was restricted to the irradiated side. These doses also resulted in ipsilateral up-regulation of calbindin and HSP-72. Parvalbumin was down-regulated at 130 CGE. The 30 and 60 CGE animals displayed a marked increase in HSP-72 staining on the irradiated side but no demonstrable cell loss. No asymmetries were noted in somatostatin, calretinin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase staining. Normal physiology was found in rats receiving up to 60 CGE.CONCLUSION: This study expands our understanding of the effects of radiosurgery on the mammalian brain. Three months after PBR, the irradiated rat hippocampus demonstrates necrosis at 90 CGE, but not at 60 CGE, with associated abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging, physiology, and memory testing. HSP-72 was up-regulated at nonnecrotic doses.",Included
454,"A gene therapy/targeted radiotherapy strategy for radiation cell kill by. BACKGROUND: Although [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is currently one of the best agents available for targeted radiotherapy, its use is confined to a few neural crest derived tumours which accumulate the radiopharmaceutical via the noradrenaline transporter (NAT). To determine whether this drug could be used for the treatment of non-NAT expressing tumours following genetic manipulation, we previously showed that plasmid mediated transfection of NAT into a non-NAT expressing glioblastoma cell line, UVW, endowed the host cells with the capacity to actively accumulate [131I]MIBG. We now present data defining the conditions required for complete sterilisation of NAT transfected cells cultured as multicellular spheroids and treated with [131I]MIBG. METHOD(S): NAT transfected UVW cells, grown as monolayers and spheroids, were treated with various doses of [131I]MIBG and assessed for cell kill by clonogenic survival and measurement of spheroid volume over time (growth delay). Spheroids were left intact for different time periods to assess the effect of radiation crossfire on cell death. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Total clonogen sterilisation was observed when the cells were grown as three-dimensional spheroids and treated with 7 MBq/ml [131I]MIBG. The added benefit of radiation crossfire was demonstrated by the improvement in cell kill achieved by prolongation of the maintenance of [131I]MIBG treated spheroids in their three-dimensional form, before disaggregation and clonogenic assay. When left intact for 48 h after treatment, spheroid cure was achieved by exposure to 6 MBq/ml [131I]MIBG. These results demonstrate that the efficiency of cell kill by [131I]MIBG targeted therapy is strongly dependent on beta-particle crossfire irradiation. This gene therapy/targeted radiotherapy strategy has potential for [131I]MIBG mediated cell kill in tumours other than those derived from the neural crest.",Excluded
442,"The influence of narrow-and broad-band UVB radiation on the epidermis apoptosis in experimental animals. Studies on apoptosis and the influence of UVB radiation on this process have important cognitive aspects. They are a source of information about the interaction between the ultraviolet radiation and the biological material. The purpose of the study was to compare the narrow- and broad-band UVB radiation in terms of its influence on the epidermis apoptosis in experimental animals. Immunohistochemically, the number of apoptosis cells was counted in the epidermis. In 6 consecutive fields of vision measuring 82.4 mum x 82.4 mum, the number of cells with positive PARP reaction was counted. They were counted in three slices in the control group and in each of the experimental groups. The results underwent statistical analysis. Percentages, arithmetic means and standard deviations were calculated. It was proved that UVB radiation leads to enhanced apoptosis in the epidermis. The largest number of apoptotic cells per a surface assessed was observed in the BB-UVB-D experimental group. In this group there were 20 times more apoptotic cells than in the controls. When the number of apoptotic cells was compared between the narrow-band irradiated group and that irradiated with the broad band of UVB, the latter was found to induce about three times more apoptotic cells than the former did. The data obtained after the analysis of the results allowed for a comparative evaluation of the both radiation wavebands, which was also important from the clinical point of view. A full understanding of the complex apoptosis process can contribute to the knowledge about the process of photocarcinogenesis and help find a possible relation between an increased risk of skin carcinogenesis and a distorted apoptotic response.",Excluded

1185,"Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields in relation to leukemia and brain tumors: a case-control study in Sweden. Occupational exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) was studied in 250 leukemia patients and 261 brain-tumor cases, diagnosed in 1983-87 and compared with a control group of 1,121 randomly selected men, from the mid-region of Sweden, 1983-87. We based the exposure assessment on measurements from 1,015 different workplaces. On the basis of the job held longest during the 10-year period before diagnosis, we found an association between the average, daily, mean level of EMF and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The risk increased with increasing level of exposure. The odds ratios (OR) and the 95 percent confidence interval (CI) for three consecutive levels of exposure were: 1.1 (CI = 0.5-2.3); 2.2 (CI = 1.1-4.3); 3.0 (CI = 1.6-5.8), respectively. No association was observed for acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 1.0, CI = 0.5-1.8; OR = 0.8, CI = 0.4-1.6; OR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.9). For brain tumors, the corresponding risk estimates were 1.0 (CI = 0.7-1.6); 1.5 (CI = 1.0-2.2); 1.4 (CI = 0.9-2.1). Different EMF indices were tested. Tasks with frequent or large variations between high and low field-densities (high standard deviation) were more common among CLL subjects. For brain tumors, a prolonged high level (high median values) showed the strongest association. Confounding by place of residence, smoking, benzene, ionizing radiation, pesticides, and solvents was evaluated, and these factors did not seem to have a decisive influence on the associations. We also analyzed other potential sources of bias. For CLL, there were indications of an excess number of low-exposure subjects among non-responders, which, to some extent, may have enhanced but not caused the risk estimates obtained. Our conclusion is that the study supports the hypothesis that occupational EMF exposure is a hazard in the development of certain cancers.",Excluded

Light regulates the c-fos protooncogene in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), with increased expression after animals are exposed to light during the dark phase of a light-dark cycle or during the subjective night in constant darkness. To determine whether this phase-dependent activation of c-Fos persists in an acute in vitro preparation, we prepared horizontal slices of hamster ventral hypothalamus, electrically stimulated the still-attached optic nerves, recorded the resulting evoked potentials in the SCN, and examined c-Fos protein levels in the nucleus by immunohistochemistry. The number of SCN cells labeled for immunoreactive c-Fos was significantly increased in slices stimulated during projected night, but not during projected day, compared to matched, sham-stimulated control slices. These results imply that the phase-dependent mechanism that gates c-Fos photoinduction in vivo is intrinsic to SCN tissue, and they suggest that an in vitro slice preparation will provide a useful model for dissecting the responsible signal transduction elements.",Excluded
1119,"Environmental enrichment enhances neurogenesis and improves functional outcome after cranial irradiation. Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for brain tumors but it can cause delayed progressive cognitive decline and memory deficits. Previous studies suggested that this neurocognitive dysfunction might be linked to the impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, little is known regarding how to reduce the cognitive impairment caused by radiation therapy. To investigate whether environmental enrichment (EE) promotes neurogenesis and cognitive function after irradiation, irradiated gerbils were housed in EE for 2 months and evaluated by neurobehavioral testing for learning and memory function, and immunohistochemical analysis for neurogenesis. Our results demonstrated that even relatively low doses (5-10 Gy) of irradiation could acutely abolish precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus by more than 90%. This reduction in precursor proliferation was persistent and led to a significant decline in the granule cell population 9 months later. EE housing enhanced the number of newborn neurons and increased residual neurogenesis. EE also significantly increased the total number of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, irradiated animals after EE housing showed a significant improvement in spatial learning and memory during the water-maze test and in rotorod motor learning over a 5-day training paradigm. In conclusion, EE has a positive impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and functional recovery in irradiated adult gerbils. Our data suggest that there is still a considerable amount of plasticity remaining in the hippocampal progenitor cells in adult animals after radiation injury, which can become a target of therapeutic intervention for radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction.",Included

Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder with pleiotropic phenotypes, including neuronal degeneration, immune dysfunction, premature ageing and increased cancer risk. The gene mutated in AT, ATM, encodes a putative lipid or protein kinase. Most of the human AT patient phenotypes are recapitulated in Atm-deficient mice. Cells derived from Atm-/- mice, like those from AT patients, exhibit abnormal response to ionizing radiation. One of the known responses to ionizing radiation is the activation of a nuclear tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-abl proto-oncogene. Ionizing radiation does not activate c-Abl in cells from AT patients or in thymocytes or fibroblasts from the Atm-deficient mice. Ectopic expression of a functional ATM kinase domain corrects this defect, as it phosphorylates the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in vitro at Ser 465, leading to the activation of c-Abl. A mutant c-Abl with Ser 465 changed to Ala 465 is not activated by ionizing radiation or ATM kinase in vivo. These findings identify the c-Abl tyrosine kinase as a downstream target of phosphorylation and activation by the ATM kinase in the cellular response to ionizing radiation.",Excluded

89,"Survival Patterns of 5750 Stereotactic Radiosurgery-Treated Patients with Brain Metastasis as a Function of the Number of Lesions. BACKGROUND: The number of brain metastases (BMs) plays an important role in the decision between stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and whole-brain radiation therapy.METHODS: We analyzed the survival of 5750 SRS-treated patients with BM as a function of BM number. Survival analyses were performed with Kaplan-Meier analysis as well as univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: Patients with BMs were first categorized as those with 1, 2-4, and 5-10 BMs based on the scheme proposed by Yamamoto et al. (Lancet Oncology 2014). Median overall survival for patients with 1 BM was superior to those with 2-4 BMs (7.1 months vs. 6.4 months, P = 0.009), and survival of patients with 2-4 BMs did not differ from those with 5-10 BMs (6.4 months vs. 6.3 months, P = 0.170). The median survival of patients with >10 BMs was lower than those with 2-10 BMs (6.3 months vs. 5.5 months, P = 0.025). In a multivariate model that accounted for age, Karnofsky Performance Score, systemic disease status, tumor histology, and cumulative intracranial tumor volume, we observed a ~10% increase in hazard of death when comparing patients with 1 versus 2-10 BMs (P < 0.001) or 10 versus >10 BMs (P < 0.001). When BM number was modeled as a continuous variable rather than using the classification by Yamamoto et al., we observed a step-wise 4% increase in the hazard of death for every increment of 6-7 BM (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of BM number to overall survival is modest and should be considered as one of the many variables considered in the decision between SRS and whole-brain radiation therapy.",Excluded

Preclinical data have demonstrated that ionizing radiation acts synergistically with capecitabine. This report retrospectively assessed the use of capecitabine concurrently with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer. From January 2003 to March 2005, five breast cancer patients with brain metastases were referred for WBRT with concurrent capecitabine. Median age was 44 years (range: 38-53). The median dose of capecitabine was 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days (day1-14). Treatment cycles were repeated every 21 days, concurrently with WBRT (30 Gy, 3 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week). Median survival after starting WBRT plus capecitabine was 6.5 months (range 1-34 months). One patient achieved a complete response. Two patients achieved partial response, including one with local control lasting until most recent follow-up. One patient had stable disease. The remaining patient was not assessable for response because of early death. Most commonly reported adverse events were nausea (n = 2) and headache (n = 2), always grade 1. Other toxicities were grade 3 hand/foot syndrome (n = 1), moderate anemia requiring transfusion and dose reduction of capecitabine (n = 1), and grade 1 mucositis (n = 1).

AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the inhibitory effects of Tanshinone II(A) on the production of proinflammation cytokines in radiation-stimulated microglia.METHODS: Microglia cells were treated with 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 Gy of irradiation or sham-irradiated in the presence or absence of 1.0 microg/mL of Tanshinone II(A). The effects of Tanshinone II(A) on radiation-induced proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction; the expression level of nuclear factor (NF-kappabeta) p65 in cytoplasm and nucleus was measured by Western blot. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy analysis were applied to detect the expression of gamma-H2AX and p65 postirradiation.RESULTS: Radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines in BV-2 cells was detectable after irradiation. Tanshinone II(A) decreased the radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines. Further, Western blotting showed that Tanshinone II(A) could attenuate the nuclear translocation of (NF-kappabeta) p65 submit postirradiation. Immunofluorescence staining showed gamma-H2AX foci formation with p65 translocation into the nucleus postirradiation.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that Tanshinone II(A) exerts anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes that might be associated with the NF-kappabeta signaling pathway. It is postulated that irradiation causes immediate cellular reaction, and that double-strand breaks trigger the molecular response that leads to NF-kappabeta pathway activation.",Included

Background(s): Neurotropic melanoma is a rare, aggressive subtype of cutaneous malignant melanoma, which frequently remains undiagnosed. Although few cases are reported with trigeminal involvement, the common presentation is sensory deficits. Here, we present trigeminal neurotropic melanoma presenting as diplopia, which is previously undocumented. Method(s): Case report. Result(s): An 85-year-old man with history of prostate cancer (post-radiation) and melanoma, presented with diplopia for one week and right upper lip and jaw hypersensitivity for seven weeks. Diplopia was most pronounced on rightward gaze; he also had mild right periorbital pain. He had Moh's excision to resect melanoma in situ: 10 years prior on his back and 3 years prior on his right temple. He underwent repeat biopsy after the temporal resection, demonstrating significant vascularity but no evidence of malignancy. His cranial nerve examination revealed no change in visual acuity, but a partial Right CN VI nerve palsy, with subtle right esotropia. There was tenderness and hypersensitivity on the right upper lip and diminished temperature sensation in the V2 distribution, with intact pinprick and light touch sensation. Masseter strength was normal and no other cranial nerves were involved. His head CT was negative; CSF/serum lab values were normal.

850,"Altered visual function in monocarboxylate transporter 3 (Slc16a8) knockout mice. To meet the high-energy demands of photoreceptor cells, the outer retina metabolizes glucose through glycolytic and oxidative pathways, resulting in large-scale production of lactate and CO(2). Mct3, a proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporter, is critically positioned to facilitate transport of lactate and H(+) out of the retina and could therefore play a role in pH and ion homeostasis of the outer retina. Mct3 is preferentially expressed in the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium and forms a heteromeric complex with the accessory protein CD147. To examine the physiological role of Mct3 in the retina, we generated mice with a targeted deletion in Mct3 (slc16A8). The overall retinal histology of 4- to 36-wk-old Mct3(-/-) mice appeared normal. In the absence of Mct3, expression of CD147 was lost from the basolateral but not apical RPE. The saturated a-wave amplitude (a(max)) of the scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) was reduced by approximately twofold in Mct3(-/-) mice relative to wild-type mice. A fourfold increase in lactate in the retina suggested a decrease in outer-retinal pH. In single-cell recordings from superfused retinal slices, saturating amplitudes of single rod photocurrents (J(max)) were comparable indicating that Mct3(-/-) mouse photoreceptor cells were inherently healthy. Based on these data, we hypothesize that disruption of Mct3 leads to a potentially reversible decrease in subretinal space pH, thereby reducing the magnitude of the light suppressible photoreceptor current.",Excluded

Objective: To investigate the regional distribution of white matter (WM) damage in patients with Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism (PSP-P) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and quantify the DTI classificatory ability in diagnosing PSP syndromes, when used in combination with infratentorial volumetry. Background Abnormal DTI measures of the superior cerebellar peduncles were reported in PSP-RS patients. A few studies showed that PSP-RS patients had DTI alterations also in the corpus callosum, internal capsulae, and long-range WM tracts. However, most of the previous studies did not include the atypical clinical presentations of PSP. Design/Methods: In 37 PSP (21 PSP-RS, 16 PSP-P) and 42 controls, tract-based spatial statistics was applied. DTI metrics were derived from supratentorial, thalamic, and infratentorial tracts. Brain atrophy was investigated using voxel-based morphometry. The MR parkinsonism index (MRPI), a combined conventional MRI measurement taking into account the midbrain and pons areas and the SCP and middle cerebellar peduncle widths, was calculated. Result(s): In PSP, grey matter (GM) atrophy involved fronto-temporal lobes and basal ganglia, and was greater in PSP-RS than PSP-P. PSP-RS had a more severe and distributed WM loss, including the midbrain, SCP, and prefrontal and motor/premotor regions. All PSP harboured diffusivity abnormalities in the corpus callosum, fronto-parietal and fronto-temporo-occipital tracts. Infratentorial WM and thalamic radiations were severely affected in PSP-RS and relatively spared in PSP-P. When MRPI and DTI measures were combined, the discriminatory power increased from 0.92 to 0.98 for PSP-RS vs. controls, from 0.70 to 0.82 for PSP-P vs. controls, and from 0.77 to 0.84 for PSP-RS vs. PSP-P.

Introduction: It is well known that a significant proportion of newly diagnosed acoustic neuromas (ANs) do not seem to change much on scans. There are less data on what happens to ANs that have initially been shown to grow on scans if left untreated. Radiation treatments can arrest growth of newly diagnosed ANs, but again, data are sparse that look specifically at the subset of ANs that have shown documented growth before radiation treatments. We reviewed our local experience with growing ANs, both what happens if left untreated and the control rate with radiation treatments. Result(s): Of those ANs that have been documented to have grown, 65% continued to grow, 30% stopped growing, and 5% decreased in size. After a mean follow-up of 60 months, 17% of the growing ANs treated with radiation continued to grow, 24% remained stable, and 59% reduced in size. Conclusion(s): There appears to be a subset of ANs that, despite showing initial growth, can stabilize in follow-up, and that radiation treatment does work but much less effectively when only those tumors that have documented prior growth are reviewed. There may be some support for the idea that radiation may be taking credit for what, in part, is the natural history of these tumors.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To analyze the incidence of and risk factors for clinically significant radiation necrosis (cRN) in adult cranial oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas treated with proton or photon therapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2007 and 2015, 160 patients with grade 2 or 3 oligodendrogliomas (with 1p/19q codeletion, n = 53) or astrocytomas (without 1p/19q codeletion, n = 107) were treated with proton (n = 37) or photon (n = 123) therapy. Clinically significant radiation necrosis (RN) was defined as symptomatic RN or asymptomatic RN that resulted in surgery or bevacizumab administration. The cumulative incidence was calculated using competing risks. Risk factors were identified using Cox proportional hazards.RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 28.5 months, cRN developed in 18 patients (proton, 6; photon, 12). The 2-year cumulative incidence of cRN for proton and photon therapy was 18.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5%-33.8%) and 9.7% (95% CI, 5.1%-16%), respectively (P = .16). On multivariate analysis, risk factors for cRN included oligodendroglioma (hazard ratio [HR], 3.57; 95% CI, 1.38-9.25; P = .009) and higher prescription dose (in gray relative biological equivalents [GyRBE]) (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61; P = .015).

Surgery, medical treatment, irradiation, or combination of these modalities is used to achieve these goals. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the clinical outcome of pituitary adenoma treated with fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of pituitary adenoma treated at our center between 2006 and 2014. A total of 88 patients with biopsy-proven adenomas were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (18-79 years) and 49 patients (56%) were males. Majority of tumors were marcoadenoma (87%). Presenting symptoms were mainly hormonal disturbance in 43 patients (49%), visual defects in 29 patients (33%) and headache in 21 patients (23%). Prolactinomas were the most common secretory adenoma in 22 patients (51%), followed by growth hormone secreting adenomas in 15 patients (35%) and ACTH-secreting tumors in 5 patients (12%), while one patient had TSH-secreting adenoma. The cohort follow up time reached 87 months (mean; 32 months). The primary endpoints are clinical and biochemical control. Result(s): Thirteen patients lost to follow up, therefore 75 patients were included in the final analysis. Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 70 patients (93%).While medical treatment was used for inoperable or hormonal secreting adenoma in 30 patients (40%). Fractionated radiation therapy was delivered to 28 patients (37%), indications for radiation were symptomatic, incompletely resected tumors (16 patients) or persistent hypersecretion (12 patients). For secretory tumors the median radiation dose was 52Gy (50-54Gy), and lower dose was delivered for non-secretory adenoma; mean 50Gy (45-52Gy). For patients received radiation therapy, the tumor control rate is 75% for non-functioning adenomas, and 69% for functioning adenomas. Conclusion(s): Pituitary adenoma is a slow growing benign tumor; however devastating effect can result from neurological deficits or hormonal imbalance. Our results reveal that functioning adenomas carry worse prognosis. Fractionated radiation therapy, as an adjunct to surgery and medical treatment, offers good clinical and biochemical control for pituitary adenoma. More aggressive multimodal approach and incorporation of new radiation technique may help to achieve better clinical outcome.",Included

238,Helical TomoTherapy in the treatment of central nervous system metastasis. In this report the authors review the use of radiotherapy in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. They comment on different treatment methods for both intracranial and extracranial CNS metastasis and discuss some of the evidence supporting the use of radiotherapy in these settings. Recent advancements in radiation oncology technology are briefly reviewed with a focus on the advantages and disadvantages of helical TomoTherapy-based treatment strategies. A review of pertinent current literature was performed. TomoTherapy research currently underway at the University of Virginia Health System is discussed and a representative case is presented. Radiotherapy for CNS metastasis is an effective treatment that provides palliation of symptoms and confers a survival advantage on selected patients. Advances in radiotherapy techniques continue to improve the therapeutic ratio for patients with CNS metastases. Helical TomoTherapy offers distinct advantages for patients with CNS metastatic disease by sparing normal tissue when intracranial or extracranial disease is targeted. [References: 17],Excluded
446,"Treatment of acromegaly patients with risk-adapted single or fractionated stereotactic high-precision radiotherapy: High local control and low toxicity in a pooled series. PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to evaluate a prospectively initiated two-center protocol of risk-adapted stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with acromegaly.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total 35 patients (16 men/19 women, mean age 54 years) were prospectively included in a treatment protocol of SRS [planning target volume (PTV < 4 ccm, > 2 mm to optic pathways = low risk] or SRT (PTV >= 4 ccm, <= 2 mm to optic pathways = high risk). The mean tumor volume was 3.71 ccm (range: 0.11-22.10 ccm). Based on the protocol guidelines, 21 patients were treated with SRS and 12 patients with SRT, 2 patients received both consecutively.RESULTS: The median follow-up (FU) reached 8 years with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 87.3% [confidence interval (CI): 70.8-95.6%] and 5-year local control rate of 97.1% (CI: 83.4-99.8%). Almost 80% (28/35) presented tumor shrinkage during FU. Endocrinological cure was achieved in 23% and IGF-1 normalization with reduced medication was achieved in 40% of all patients. An endocrinological response was generally achieved within the first 3 years, but endocrinological cure can require more than 8 years. A new adrenocorticotropic hypopituitarism occurred in 13 patients (46.4%). A new visual field disorder and a new oculomotor palsy occurred in 1 patient, respectively. Patients with occurrence of visual/neurological impairments had a longer FU (p = 0.049).CONCLUSION: Our SRS/SRT protocol proved to be safe and successful in terms of tumor control and protection of the visual system. The timing and rate of endocrine improvements are difficult to predict. One has to accept an unavoidable rate of additional adrenocorticotropic hypopituitarism in the long term.",Excluded
568,"Absolute quantification of cerebral blood flow with magnetic resonance, reproducibility of the method, and comparison with H2(15)O positron emission tomography. While H2(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) is still the gold standard in the quantitative assessment of cerebral perfusion (rCBF), its technical challenge, limited availability, and radiation exposure are disadvantages of the method. Recent work demonstrated the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) for quantitative cerebral perfusion imaging. There remain open questions, however, especially regarding reproducibility. The main purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of MR-derived flow values to those derived from H2(15)O PET. Positron emission tomography and MR perfusion imaging was performed in 20 healthy male volunteers, who were chronic smokers, on day 1 and day 3 of a 4-day hospitalization. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups, each with 10 subjects. One group was allowed to smoke as usual during the hospitalization, while the other group stopped smoking from day 2. Positron emission tomography and MR images were coregistered and rCBF was determined in two regions of interest, defined over gray matter (gm) and white matter (wm), yielding rCBF(PET)gm, rCBF(MR)gm, rCBF(PET)wm, and rCBF(MR)wm. Bland-Altman analysis was used to investigate reproducibility by assessing the difference rCBFday3 - rCBFday1 in eight continual-smoker volunteers. The analysis showed a good reproducibility for PET, but not for MR. Mean +/- SD of the difference rCBFday3 - rCBFday1 in gray matter was 6.35 +/- 21.06 and 0.49 +/- 5.27 mL x min(-1) x 100 g(-1) for MR and PET, respectively; the corresponding values in white matter were 2.60 +/- 15.64 and -1.14 +/- 4.16 mL x min(-1) x 100 g(-1). The Bland-Altman analysis was also used to assess MRI and PET agreement comparing rCBF measured on day 1. The analysis demonstrated a reasonably good agreement of MR and PET in white matter (rCBF(PET)wm - rCBF(MR)wm; -0.09 +/- 7.23 mL x min(-1) x 100 g(-1)), while in gray matter a reasonable agreement was only achieved after removing vascular artifacts in the MR perfusion maps (rCBF(PET)gm - rCBF(MR)gm; -11.73 +/- 14.52 mL x min(-1) x 100 g(-1)). In line with prior work, these results demonstrate that reproducibility was overall considerably better for PET than for MR. Until reproducibility is improved and vascular artifacts are efficiently removed, MR is not suitable for reliable quantitative perfusion measurements.",Excluded
747,"Does the robotic platform reduce the morbidity associated with combined radical surgery and adjuvant radiation for early cervical cancer?. Objectives: Open radical hysterectomy (RH) followed by adjuvant radiation (XRT) for cervical cancer has been associated with high morbidity; however, RHs are now often performed robotically. We examined if the robotic platform decreases the morbidity associated with radical surgery followed by adjuvant XRT. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of patients with cervical cancer undergoing RH from 1995-2013 was performed. Clinical and pathologic data were obtained from the medical record. Long-term (LT) complications were defined as urinary and/or bowel complications, and lymphedema presenting more than 30 days after completion of therapy. Complications were graded. Grade 1 was mild symptoms and easily treated. Grade 2 was symptoms resolving with long-term medical therapy. Grade 3 was major symptoms requiring surgery or invasive procedures. The X<sup>2</sup> and student t tests were used for analysis. Result(s): Overall, 243 patients underwent RH for cervical cancer. The open surgical approach was used in 43% (n = 104) and the robotic approach was used in 57% (n = 139). Eighty-three patients (34.2%) required adjuvant XRT. XRT was associated with increased risk of LT complication (28.9% vs 7.0% P <.001). LT complications included lymphedema (n = 18), bowel-associated complications (enteritis/proctitis n = 8, obstruction n = 2), and urinary complications (hemorrhagic cystitis n = 1, neurogenic bladder n = 2, fistula n = 1, and ureteral stricture n = 3). Among patients who received adjuvant XRT, the open surgical approach was used in 48% (n = 40) and the robotic approach in 52% (n = 43). There was no difference in time to initiation of XRT between the 2 surgical groups (43.2 +/- 15.6 vs 47.3 +/- 19.6 days, P =.33). There was no difference in grade 2/3 LT complications in patients receiving adjuvant XRT between the groups (27.5% vs 27.9%, P =.97). However, patients undergoing open surgery experienced a trend toward increased adhesion-related complications, such as bowel obstruction and ureteral stricture (10% vs 2.3%, P =.19). Conclusion(s): We found no difference in LT complications between patients who underwent robotic and those who underwent open RH and adjuvant XRT. Fewer adhesion-related LT complications may be seen with robotic surgery. However, because many XRT-related complications occur at later time points, continued follow-up is needed to evaluate for potential differences between the 2 groups.",Included
232,"Short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy before total mesorectal excision (TME) versus preoperative chemoradiotherapy, TME, and optional adjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer (RAPIDO): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: Systemic relapses remain a major problem in locally advanced rectal cancer. Using short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy and delayed surgery, the Rectal cancer And Preoperative Induction therapy followed by Dedicated Operation (RAPIDO) trial aimed to reduce distant metastases without compromising locoregional control.METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, participants were recruited from 54 centres in the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Slovenia, Denmark, Norway, and the USA. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, had a biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed, primary, locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma, which was classified as high risk on pelvic MRI (with at least one of the following criteria: clinical tumour [cT] stage cT4a or cT4b, extramural vascular invasion, clinical nodal [cN] stage cN2, involved mesorectal fascia, or enlarged lateral lymph nodes), were mentally and physically fit for chemotherapy, and could be assessed for staging within 5 weeks before randomisation. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a management system with a randomly varying block design (each block size randomly chosen to contain two to four allocations), stratified by centre, ECOG performance status, cT stage, and cN stage, to either the experimental or standard of care group. All investigators remained masked for the primary endpoint until a prespecified number of events was reached. Patients allocated to the experimental treatment group received short-course radiotherapy (5 x 5 Gy over a maximum of 8 days) followed by six cycles of CAPOX chemotherapy (capecitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally twice daily on days 1-14, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1, and a chemotherapy-free interval between days 15-21) or nine cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1, leucovorin [folinic acid] 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1 and 2, followed by bolus fluorouracil 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously and fluorouracil 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously for 22 h on days 1 and 2, and a chemotherapy-free interval between days 3-14) followed by total mesorectal excision. Choice of CAPOX or FOLFOX4 was per physician discretion or hospital policy. Patients allocated to the standard of care group received 28 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy up to 50.4 Gy or 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy up to 50.0 Gy (per physician discretion or hospital policy), with concomitant twice-daily oral capecitabine 825 mg/m<sup>2</sup> followed by total mesorectal excision and, if stipulated by hospital policy, adjuvant chemotherapy with eight cycles of CAPOX or 12 cycles of FOLFOX4. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-related treatment failure, defined as the first occurrence of locoregional failure, distant metastasis, new primary colorectal tumour, or treatment-related death, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed by intention to treat. This study is registered with the EudraCT, 2010-023957-12, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01558921, and is now complete.FINDINGS: Between June 21, 2011, and June 2, 2016, 920 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment, of whom 912 were eligible (462 in the experimental group; 450 in the standard of care group). Median follow-up was 4.6 years (IQR 3.5-5.5). At 3 years after randomisation, the cumulative probability of disease-related treatment failure was 23.7% (95% CI 19.8-27.6) in the experimental group versus 30.4% (26.1-34.6) in the standard of care group (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95; p=0.019). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse event during preoperative therapy in both groups was diarrhoea (81 [18%] of 460 patients in the experimental group and 41 [9%] of 441 in the standard of care group) and neurological toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy in the standard of care group (16 [9%] of 187 patients). Serious adverse events occurred in 177 (38%) of 460 participants in the experimental group and, in the standard of care group, in 87 (34%) of 254 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy and in 64 (34%) of 187 with adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four participants in the experimental group (one cardiac arrest, one pulmonary embolism, two infectious complications) and in four participants in the standard of care group (one pulmonary embolism, one neutropenic sepsis, one aspiration, one suicide due to severe depression).INTERPRETATION: The observed decreased probability of disease-related treatment failure in the experimental group is probably indicative of the increased efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy as opposed to adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting. Therefore, the experimental treatment can be considered as a new standard of care in high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer.FUNDING: Dutch Cancer Foundation, Swedish Cancer Society, Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, and Spanish Clinical Research Network.",Excluded

By combining a detailed geometrical optics model with Monte-Carlo scattering simulations we introduce and validate a simulation strategy for predicting temporal focusing characteristics in scattering and non-scattering media. The broadening of the temporal focus width with increasing depth in brain tissue is studied using both simulations and experiments for several key optical geometries, and an analytical approximation is found for the dependence of this broadening on the microscope's parameters in a transparent medium. Our results indicate that a multiphoton temporal focus has radically different broadening characteristics in deep tissue than those of a spatial focus.",Excluded
810,"Depleted and natural uranium: chemistry and toxicological effects. Depleted uranium (DU) is a by-product from the chemical enrichment of naturally occurring uranium. Natural uranium is comprised of three radioactive isotopes: (238)U, (235)U, and (234)U. This enrichment process reduces the radioactivity of DU to roughly 30% of that of natural uranium. Nonmilitary uses of DU include counterweights in airplanes, shields against radiation in medical radiotherapy units and transport of radioactive isotopes. DU has also been used during wartime in heavy tank armor, armor-piercing bullets, and missiles, due to its desirable chemical properties coupled with its decreased radioactivity. DU weapons are used unreservedly by the armed forces. Chemically and toxicologically, DU behaves similarly to natural uranium metal. Although the effects of DU on human health are not easily discerned, they may be produced by both its chemical and radiological properties. DU can be toxic to many bodily systems, as presented in this review. Most importantly, normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, and heart can be affected by DU exposure. Numerous other systems can also be affected by DU exposure, and these are also reviewed. Despite the prevalence of DU usage in many applications, limited data exist regarding the toxicological consequences on human health. This review focuses on the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and toxicological effects of depleted and natural uranium on several systems in the mammalian body.

600,"What is the role of combined chemoradiotherapy for grade III glioma in adults?. Classification, prognosis and treatment of grade III glioma is now determined predominantly by molecular biomarkers, with 1p19q chromosomal co-deletion conferring a clear prognostic benefit and also being associated with better response to chemotherapy. The importance of this molecular biomarker is reflected in the updated WHO classification of central nervous system tumours that was published in 2016. Long term data from two large, randomised trials have shown that patients with 1p19q co-deleted anaplastic oligodendrogliomas derive significant survival benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy. More recent data from the NOA-04 study indicate that primary chemotherapy is not superior to primary radiotherapy in any molecular subgroup of anaplastic glioma and hence do not support the concept of 'delayed radiotherapy' in these patients. Despite the documented association of chemosensitivity with 1p19q co-deletion, a recent planned interim analysis of the CATNON study revealed that patients with anaplastic astrocytomas with inatct 1p19q chromosomal regions also derive significant benefit from the addition of adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy. It is not yet known whether the use of temozolomide concomitant with radiotherapy confers additional benefit; these hotly anticipated data are not expected to be available for at least two years. Hence, all patients with grade III gliomas appear to benefit from both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with maximum survival benefit being achieved by 'early' rather than 'delayed' treatment. A number of questions remain, including the optimum scheduling of these treatments and the optimum radiotherapy regime for the different molecular subtypes. The question of radiation dose and volume is particularly important for this group of patients in whom long term survival can be anticipated and the risks and potential impact of neurotoxicity are significant. Strategies to reduce the long term neurocognitive impact of radiotherapy in these patients should be developed and incorporated into future clinical trials.",Excluded
993,"Delayed effects of whole brain radiotherapy in germ cell tumor patients with central nervous system metastases. PURPOSE: Central nervous system (CNS) metastases are uncommon in patients with germ cell tumors, with an incidence of 2-3%. CNS metastases have been managed with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and concomitant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Our previous study did not observe serious CNS toxicity (Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1991;22:17-22). We now report on 5 patients who developed delayed significant CNS toxicity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We observed 5 patients with delayed CNS toxicity. The initial diagnosis was between 1981 and 2003. All patients had poor-risk disease according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Collaborative Group criteria. Of the 5 patients, 3 had CNS metastases at diagnosis and 2 developed relapses with CNS metastases. These 5 patients underwent WBRT to 4,000-5,000 cGy in 18-28 fractions concurrently with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.RESULTS: All 5 patients developed delayed symptoms consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The symptoms included seizures, hemiparesis, cranial neuropathy, headaches, blindness, dementia, and ataxia. The median time from WBRT to CNS symptoms was 72 months (range, 9-228). Head imaging revealed multiple abnormalities consistent with gliosis and diffuse cerebral atrophy. Of the 5 patients, 3 had progressive and 2 stable symptoms. Treatment with surgery and/or steroids had modest benefit. The progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy resulted in significant debility in all 5 patients, resulting in death (3 patients), loss of work, steroid-induced morbidity, and recurrent hospitalizations.CONCLUSION: Whole brain radiotherapy is not innocuous in young patients with germ cell tumors and can cause late CNS toxicity.",Excluded

Multivariable analysis was conducted with use of a Cox proportional hazards model and a stepwise selection algorithm that used p < 0.10 as the criteria for entry and p < 0.05 as retention in the model to identify independent predictors of survival. RESULT(S): Chart records of 478patients (54% of whom were men) diagnosed between 1991 and 2010 were included for analysis. The median age at presentation was 41 years (range, 18-83 years).42% of patients had biopsy only, 27% had gross total resection, 6% had near. total resection, and 25% had subtotal resection. 22% of patients were initially treated with radiation, 30% with adjuvant chemotherapy, and 7% with concurrent chemotherapy.

251,"Evaluating the influence of setup uncertainties on treatment planning for focal liver tumors. PURPOSE: A mechanism has been developed to evaluate the influence of random setup variations on dose during treatment planning. The information available for studying these factors shifts from population-based models toward patient-specific data as treatment progresses and setup measurements for an individual patient become available. This study evaluates the influence of population as well as patient-specific setup distributions on treatment plans for focal liver tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients with focal liver tumors were treated on a protocol that involved online setup measurement and adjustment, as well as ventilatory immobilization. Summary statistics from these three-dimensional conformal treatments yielded individual and population distributions of position at initial setup for each fraction. A convolution model for evaluation of the influence of random setup variation on calculated dose distributions has been previously described and investigated for application to focal liver radiotherapy by our department. Individual patient doses based on initial setup positions were calculated by convolving the calculated dose distribution with an anisotropic probability distribution function representing the individual patient's random variations. A separate convolution using population-averaged random variations was performed. Individual beam apertures were then adjusted to provide plans that ensured proper dose to the clinical target volume following convolution with population distributions, as well as individual patient position uncertainty models.RESULTS: Individual patient setup distributions for the course of treatment had random setup variations (sigma) that ranged from 2.5 to 5.7 mm (left-right), 2.1 to 8.3 mm (anterior-posterior), and 4.1 to 10.8 mm (cranial-caudal). The population random components were 4.2 mm (left-right), 4.1 mm (anterior-posterior), and 7.0 mm (cranial-caudal) at initial setup. The initial static planned dose distribution overestimated the volume of liver irradiated to high doses, because inclusion of setup uncertainties generally blurred the resulting doses, shifting the higher-dose region of normal liver dose-volume histograms to lower doses. Furthermore, the population-based dose convolution tended to predict a higher risk of radiation damage to the liver (based on an in-house parameterization of the Lyman normal tissue complication probability model) than the individual patient calculations. For an individual plan, application of different individual random variations yielded change in effective volume differences with a 3% range. Plan adjustment to account for random setup variations generally resulted in a lower change in effective volume than initial planning using a planning target volume followed by calculation of delivered dose based on random offsets.CONCLUSION: This study hints at the factors that most strongly influence planning of liver treatments taking into account geometric variations. Given a setup verification methodology that rapidly reduces systematic offsets, the importance of realistic incorporation of geometric variations as an initial step in treatment planning, as well as possible plan refinement, is demonstrated.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Spine surgeons are exposed to high amounts of radiation from fluoroscopic procedures during their lifetime. In this study, we evaluated spine surgeons' knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine surgery.METHODS: We developed a questionnaire including questions about surgeons' characteristics and knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine surgery. A survey was performed with the members of AOSpine Latin America. The main variables studied were specialty, years of experience, surgeon's position during fluoroscopy, and practices to reduce the patient's and surgeon's radiation exposure during surgery. The results were analyzed and compared among different specialties, levels of experience, and countries of origin.RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 371 members of AOSpine Latin America from different countries. The sample was mostly from orthopedic surgeons (57.1%) and surgeons in practice for longer than 10 years (54.2%). Thyroid lead protection was used by 64.2% of the spine surgeons, lead glasses by 20.2%, and lead gloves by 7%. A dosimeter badge was never or only rarely used by 75.7%. The correct answer for surgeon position during lateral lumbar fluoroscopy was reported by only one-third of the surgeons. The reported rate of thyroid protector use was higher in surgeons from Brazil and Colombia compared with surgeons from Mexico and Argentina (P < 0.001), whereas the use of pulsed-mode fluoroscopy was higher in Mexico and Argentina compared with Brazil and Colombia (P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts toward implementing educational programs in Latin America focused on safety strategies are needed to minimize intraoperative radiation exposure.",Excluded

619,"Neuroimaging in Pregnant Women. Choosing the most appropriate diagnostic neuroimaging study for a pregnant woman involves assessing the pretest likelihood of serious treatable neurologic disease, the diagnostic utility of various available computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) modalities, and the risks of each. Of these three elements-pretest differential diagnosis, utility of MRI and CT, and risks of MR and CT-the risk component is perhaps the least well understood by most physicians. We provide a basic review of the intrinsic risks of MRI and CT, particularly radiation biology and radiation safety, as well as the risks pertaining to the use of contrast agents, to reduce provider confusion and anxiety and improve quality, safety, and efficiency of neuroimaging diagnosis in pregnant patients. We believe that a better understanding of the associated very low risks with mother and fetus will reassure the reader that CT remains the most appropriate tool for initial rapid diagnosis of acute neurological conditions in pregnancy and that in urgent situations CT should not be withheld or delayed due to exaggerated concern about radiation. Noncontrast MRI, while not without risk, is generally considered safe in pregnancy, as no evidence of fetal adverse effects has been demonstrated to date. Iodinated CT contrast agents are likely safer than gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents because of gadolinium accumulation in the amniotic fluid and fetal tissue, although no harmful effects of tissue gadolinium accumulation are known. In most but not all pregnant patients presenting with a new or worsening neurological abnormality, the risks intrinsic to the disease will outweigh the risks of imaging. In an individual patient, the pretest probability of serious treatable disease and acuity of presentation will usually suggest an optimal imaging strategy and choice of test. This optimal strategy will also depend on the immediate availability and level of sophistication of the scanners, software, technologists, and radiologists. As such, the standard of care for imaging in pregnancy requires direct consultation between the referring clinician and radiologist to determine the most appropriate strategy and brief documentation of the resulting consensus risk-benefit assessment.

Also the activity of the catalytic unit (C) of the adenylate cyclase (as measured by forskolin stimulation), decreased monoexponentially, however with a mol.wt. of 145 kDa. Both basal, DA- and fluoride (F-)-stimulated activity declined in a concave-downward fashion with a limiting mol.wt. of 134, 138 and 228 kDa, respectively. It was estimated that the basal and DA-stimulated activity originated from an enzyme complex with a mol.wt. of 325 kDa, a value close to the combined size of RGs and C. These data suggest that F- stimulation of the adenylate cyclase, which occurs by a Gs activation, does not cause dissociation of Gs into the alpha s and beta gamma subunits. Further, the DA-regulated adenylate cyclase apparently exists as a complex consisting of RGs and C; the mechanism of hormonal activation is a dissociation of C from this complex.",Included
761,"Lymphopoiesis in the chicken pineal gland. Pineal lymphoid development was studied in two breeds of chickens from hatching until sexual maturity. No lymphocytes were found in the pineal prior to 9 days of age (da). Lymphocytes migrate through the endothelium of venules into the pineal stroma. Lymphoid tissue reached its maximal accumulation in 32-da pineal glands of both breeds. At this age, the New Hampshire (NH) breed had a larger proportion of lymphoid volume to total pineal volume (32%) than did pineal glands from White Leghorn (WL) chickens (18%). Averaged over the period 23 to 62 da, NH chickens (a heavy breed) had a lymphoid volume (0.753 mm 3) that was about three times greater (P less than 0.05) than that of the lighter WL breed (0.251 mm 3). Lymphocytes are able to enter cerebrospinal fluid form lymphoid accumulations (LA) embedded in the choroid plexus by migrating between choroid ependymal cells. The 122-da chickens typically lacked lymphoid tissue in the pineal gland with the exception of occasional LA contained in capsular tissue. Surgical bursectomy, thymectomy, or their combination at hatching followed with whole-body irradiation (IR) at 24 hours postsurgery inhibited the initial influx of lymphocytes usually seen in 9-da pineal glands. Also, these treatments prevented formation of germinal centers normally found in the pineal at 3 and 5 weeks and reduced total pineal volume at each age examined. However, pineal lymphoid volume of the surgical-IR group did not differ from control-IR chickens at either 3 or 5 weeks. Pineal glands from birds made agammaglobulinemic (bursa-cell depleted) by cyclophosphamide treatment in ovo were devoid of germinal centers, although thin strands of lymphocytes were usually found along venous sinuses. These dissociation studies suggest that the normal expression of lymphoid tissue in the chicken pineal gland is dependent on the bursa and thymus. Furthermore, these observations indicate that the pineal gland should be considered a functional component of the chicken's lymphomyeloid complex.",Excluded
282,"The hippocampus in aging and disease: From plasticity to vulnerability. The hippocampus has a pivotal role in learning and in the formation and consolidation of memory and is critically involved in the regulation of emotion, fear, anxiety, and stress. Studies of the hippocampus have been central to the study of memory in humans and in recent years, the regional specialization and organization of hippocampal functions have been elucidated in experimental models and in human neurological and psychiatric diseases. The hippocampus has long been considered a classic model for the study of neuroplasticity as many examples of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation and -depression have been identified and demonstrated in hippocampal circuits. Neuroplasticity is the ability to adapt and reorganize the structure or function to internal or external stimuli and occurs at the cellular, population, network or behavioral level and is reflected in the cytological and network architecture as well as in intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons and circuits. The high degree of hippocampal neuroplasticity might, however, be also negatively reflected in the pronounced vulnerability of the hippocampus to deleterious conditions such as ischemia, epilepsy, chronic stress, neurodegeneration and aging targeting hippocampal structure and function and leading to cognitive deficits. Considering this framework of plasticity and vulnerability, we here review basic principles of hippocampal anatomy and neuroplasticity on various levels as well as recent findings regarding the functional organization of the hippocampus in light of the regional vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, epilepsy, neuroinflammation and aging.

825,"Amifostine: an update on its clinical status as a cytoprotectant in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy and its potential therapeutic application in myelodysplastic syndrome. UNLABELLED: Amifostine (WR-2721) is a cytoprotective agent that protects a broad range of normal tissues from the toxic effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy without attenuating tumour response. This selective protection is due to the greater conversion and uptake of the active metabolite, WR- 1065, in normal versus neoplastic tissues. In a pivotal phase III trial, 242 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were randomised to receive treatment with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with or without pretreatment with intravenous amifostine 910 mg/m2. Over 6 cycles of therapy, amifostine significantly reduced haematological, renal and neurological toxicities: treatment delays, treatment discontinuation and days in hospital related to these adverse events were also significantly reduced in patients receiving amifostine versus patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In another randomised phase III trial in 303 patients with head and neck cancer undergoing irradiation therapy (total dose 50 to 70Gy), pretreatment with intravenous amifostine 200 mg/m2 significantly reduced the incidence of acute and late grade > or =2 xerostomia. However, mucositis was not significantly reduced in amifostine recipients compared with patients receiving radiotherapy alone, although this has been shown in smaller randomised trials. Amifostine (340 mg/m2) also provided significant protection against pneumonitis and oesophagitis in patients with lung cancer receiving thoracic irradiation in a preliminary report from a phase III trial (n = 144). Other studies have demonstrated protective effects of amifostine in other tumour types and other chemotherapy, radiation and radiochemotherapy regimens; however, evidence is still limited in these indications. No evidence of tumour protection by amifostine has been demonstrated in any clinical trials. Amifostine has also been shown to stimulate haematopoietic stem cells and has been investigated as a therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in number of small preliminary studies. At the recommended dose and schedule, amifostine is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are usually reversible and manageable and those most frequently experienced include nausea and vomiting, transient hypotension and somnolence and sneezing.CONCLUSION: The results of phase III trials have confirmed the safety and efficacy of amifostine as a cytoprotectant to ameliorate cisplatin-induced cumulative renal toxicity, for which it is the only agent proven to be effective, and neutropenia in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, and to reduce xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer receiving irradiation therapy. Depending on the outcome of numerous ongoing clinical trials, amifostine may eventually find broader clinical applications, both as a cytoprotectant and as a potential therapy in myelodysplastic syndrome.

626,"Superoxide dismutase (sod-1) null mutants of Neurospora crassa: oxidative stress sensitivity, spontaneous mutation rate and response to mutagens. Enzymatic superoxide-dismutase activity is believed to be important in defense against the toxic effects of superoxide. Although superoxide dismutases are among the best studied proteins, numerous questions remain concerning the specific biological roles of the various superoxide-dismutase types. In part, this is because the proposed damaging effects of superoxide are manifold, ranging from inactivation of certain metabolic enzymes to DNA damage. Studies with superoxide-deficient mutants have proven valuable, but surprisingly few such studies have been reported. We have constructed and characterized Neurospora crassa mutants that are null for sod-1, the gene that encodes copper-zinc superoxide dismutase. Mutant strains are sensitive to paraquat and elevated oxygen concentrations, and they exhibit an increased spontaneous mutation rate. They appear to have near wild-type sensitive to near- and far-UV, heat shock and gamma-irradiation. Unlike the equivalent Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant and the sodA sodB double mutant of Escherichia coli, they do not exhibit aerobic auxotrophy. These results are discussed in the context of an attempt to identify consensus phenotypes among superoxide dismutase-deficient mutants. N. crassa sod-1 null mutant strains were also employed in genetic and subcellular fractionation studies. Results support the hypothesis that a single gene (sod-1), located between Fsr-12 and leu-3 on linkage group I, is responsible for most or all CuZn superoxide dismutase activity in this organism.",Excluded
1122,"Optimised BNCT facility based on a compact D-D neutron generator. Background: Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a very promising treatment for patients suffering gliobastoma multiforme, an aggressive type of brain cancer, where conventional radiation therapies fail. Thermal neutrons are suitable for the direct treatment of cancers which are located at near-tissue-surface; deep-seated tumors need harder, epithermal neutron energy spectra. Material(s) and Method(s): In this work a BNCT facility based on a compact D-D neutron generator, has been simulated using the MCNP4B Monte Carlo code. The materials considered, for the design of the facility, were chosen according to the EU Directive 2002/95/EC, hence, excluded the use of cadmium and lead. Result(s): An extensive set of calculations performed with MCNP4B Mote Carlo code have show that the combination of TiF<inf>3</inf> which integrates a conic part made of D<inf>2</inf>O, then followed by a TiF<inf>3</inf> layer is the optimum moderator design. The use of BiF3 as spectrum shifter and y rays filter, Titanium as fast neutron filter and Lithium as thermal neutron filter is necessary in order to obtain an epithermal neutron beam with high quality.

989,"Pions and pig skin: preclinical evaluation of RBE for early and late damage. The skin of 50 pigs has been irradiated with negative pi mesons and with X rays in order to determine the RBE for early epidermal and later dermal damage. Late fibrosis was not studied. Four, 7, 9 and 10 fractions were used. An estimate of the RBE was made from the reactions on each pig for both early and late damage so that interanimal variability would be avoided. The data were also averaged to obtain mean dose response curves. There was no tendency for higher RBE's for late than for early skin damage. These pig studies have demonstrated an RBE of about 1.5 for early epidermal reactions and a slightly lower RBE (approximately 1.4) for later dermal damage in the same animals. This indicates that at doses of about 2.0 to 3.5 Gy pions, the medium wave skin damage is unlikely to be more severe than would be predicted from the early skin reactions and the accumulated clinical experience with X rays. However, if the trend to a steeper slope for the RBE versus dose per fraction for late injury is correct, as indicated by other published studies a relative increase in the late injury might be expected if much lower doses per fraction are used. The present clinical studies at Vancouver using 15 X 2.1 Gy pions indicate that an RBE of 1.5 is appropriate for epithelia, brain and colorectum.",Included

Metastatic bone disease from hormone-refractory prostate cancer can lead to significant morbidity such as pain, nerve compression and fractures which diminishes the quality of life of these patients substantially. Pain from osteoblastic metastases can significantly be improved by both external radiotherapy and Strontium-89 (89Sr), whereas lytic metastases are only responsive to external irradiation. Pain relief is obtained in approximately 80% of patients. Toxicity is mild and retreatment is usually possible. External beam radiotherapy is indicated when spinal cord or nerve root compression is demonstrated, or when osteolytic metastases with danger of fracture are visualized. External radiotherapy and Strontium-89 are important treatments to palliate patients suffering from metastatic prostate cancer. Because of their mild toxicity and highly effective analgesic effect, implementation of irradiation and 89Sr should be start of early in the disease process of these patients in order to keep them ambulatory and pain-free as long as possible.

BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PC) and the risk of developing stroke and thromboembolic events. Our study evaluated the association between ADT use and development of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE) in a homogenous group of men with PC treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) after controlling for multiple sources of confounding.METHODS: Observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with PC at the US Department of Veterans Affairs between 1 January 2001 and October 31, 2015 and treated with definitive RT. Exposure was initiation of ADT within 1 year of PC diagnosis. Primary outcomes were development of stroke, TIA, DVT, or PE.RESULTS: 44,246 men with median follow-up of 6.8 years. The overall cumulative incidences of stroke, TIA, DVT, and PE at 10 years were 6.0, 3.0, 3.4, and 1.9%, respectively. In the multivariable competing risks model, there was a significant association between ADT and stroke (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.09-1.30, p < 0.01), TIA (SHR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.41, p < 0.01), and DVT (SHR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.04-1.34, p < 0.01). ADT was only associated with PE in men receiving ADT for > 1 year (SHR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.06-1.69, p-value = 0.03).CONCLUSION: We observed an increase in the risk of stroke, TIA, and DVT in men receiving ADT and an increased risk of PE in men receiving long-term ADT. These results highlight concerns regarding long-term risks of ADT on stroke and thromboembolic events in the treatment of PC.",Excluded

Photolytic release of neurotransmitters from 'caged' derivates in the vicinity of visualized neurons in living brain slices meets this request. This technique allows the study of the subcellular distribution and properties of functional native neurotransmitter receptors. These are prerequisites for a detailed analysis of the expression and spatial specificity of synaptic plasticity. Photostimulation can further be used to fast map the synaptic connectivity between nearby and, more importantly, distant cells in a neuronal network.

Purpose: To investigate the radiological features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain metastases (BM) from ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated data from 40 eligible patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Radiographic features of metastatic brain tumors, including the number, size, location, and peritumoral brain edema size (PBES), were delineated using MRI. Result(s): 13 patients had metachronous BM (MBM), having developed BM at least 6 months after diagnosis with NSCLC. The remaining patients were categorized as having synchronous BM (SBM). Compared with patients in the SBM group, patients in the MBM group were found to have more favorable values for radiological features including BM number, BM size, and PBES. Ten (76.9%) of the 13 patients with MBM had <=3 lesions and were asymptomatic, and none had developed a diffuse BM pattern, supporting the adoption of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the majority of these patients and against the administration of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Conversely, among the 27 patients with SBM, 15 (55.6%) patients had >3 lesions and 12 (44.4%) patients were symptomatic, highlighting the necessity of rapidly administrating brain radiotherapy, either as SRS or whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Importantly, only two patients (5.0%) had metastases in the hippocampus and peri-hippocampus region, and both were in the SBM group, indicating the feasibility of hippocampal avoidance WBRT in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Conclusion(s): Both WBRT and SRS are appropriate for the treatment of BM in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. The incidence of BM in the hippocampus and peri-hippocampus region is low in our radiological data. Nearly 80% of patients with metachronous BM have oligo-metastatic lesions, indicating that SRS is the preferred therapy while PCI is not indicated. Copyright © The author(s).",Excluded

Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) has been successfully established for decades as an alternative analgesic treatment option for patients suffering from chronic degenerative and inflammatory diseases. In this study, 483 patients were undergoing LDRT for degenerative joint disease of the fingers and thumb at the University Hospital Erlangen between 2004 and 2019. Radiotherapy was applied according to the German guidelines for LDRT. Several impact factors on therapeutic success, such as the age and gender, the number of affected fingers, the single and cumulative dose, as well as the number of series, were investigated. In summary, 70% of the patients showed an improvement of their pain following LDRT. No significant impact was found for the factors age, gender, the number of series or the cumulative dosage. Patients with an involvement of the thumb showed a significantly worse outcome compared to patients with an isolated affection of the fingers. In this cohort, patients receiving a single dose of 0.5 Gy reported a significantly better outcome than patients receiving 1.0 Gy, strongly suggesting a reduction in the total dose.

343,"TrpC3/C7 and Slo2.1 are molecular targets for metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling in rat striatal cholinergic interneurons. Large aspiny cholinergic interneurons provide the sole source of striatal acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter critical for basal ganglia function; these tonically active interneurons receive excitatory inputs from corticostriatal glutamatergic afferents that act, in part, via metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). We combined electrophysiological recordings in brain slices with molecular neuroanatomy to identify distinct ion channel targets for mGluR1/5 receptors in striatal cholinergic interneurons: transient receptor potential channel 3/7 (TrpC3/C7) and Slo2.1. In recordings obtained with methanesulfonate-based internal solutions, we found an mGluR-activated current with voltage-dependent and pharmacological properties reminiscent of TrpC3 and TrpC7; expression of these TrpC subunits in cholinergic interneurons was verified by combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, and modulation of both TrpC channels was reconstituted in HEK293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells cotransfected with mGluR1 or mGluR5. With a chloride-based internal solution, mGluR agonists did not activate interneuron TrpC-like currents. Instead, a time-dependent, outwardly rectifying K(+) current developed after whole-cell access, and this Cl(-)-activated K(+) current was strongly inhibited by volatile anesthetics and mGluR activation. This modulation was recapitulated in cells transfected with Slo2.1, a Na(+)- and Cl(-)-activated K(+) channel, and Slo2.1 expression was confirmed histochemically in striatal cholinergic interneurons. By using gramicidin perforated-patch recordings, we established that the predominant agonist-activated current was TrpC-like when ambient intracellular chloride was preserved, although a small K(+) current contribution was observed in some cells. Together, our data indicate that mGluR1/5-mediated glutamatergic excitation of cholinergic interneurons is primarily a result of activation of TrpC3/TrpC7-like cationic channels; under conditions when intracellular NaCl is elevated, a Slo2.1 background K(+) channel may also contribute.",Excluded

523,"Tumor stage dependent contribution of bone marrow derived cells to tumor neo-vascularization. Introduction: The role of bone marrow derived cells (BMDC) in tumor neo-vascularization remains controversial. We have previously demonstrated that BMDC contribute to tumor neovascularization by differentiating into vascular support cells and not endothelial cell. In this study we focus on establishing the spatiotemporal role of BMDC in tumor neovascularisation, focusing on whether it is a tumor growth stage dependent process and more specifically examining the patterns of BMDC integration into tumor vasculature in response to radiation therapy (RTx). Method(s): Animal Models: Bone marrow of NOD/SCID mice were stably reconstituted with BM harvested from green-fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice. Intracranial (ic) xenografts were generated in intracranial window models (ICW) using a panel of glioma cell and breast cancer cells stably expressing mCherry. In-vivo imaging: Two-photon laser capture microscopy was used to obtain high-resolution real-time in-vivo longitudinal images of the tumor cells, tumor vasculature and tracing of the circulating GFP+BM cells. Mice were imaged 1d,2d,3d,7d,10d,14d,21d & <sup>30</sup>d following cell implantation or RTx. Brain Tumor Analysis: Mice were sacrificed using perfusion fixation and brains collected for correlative immunohistochemical and Immunofluorscent confocal analysis. RTx: Using in-house designed x-ray micro-irradiator stereotactic radiation was delivered through ICW to ic-xenografts, treated with either 3x2Gy or 3x5Gy. Tumor+RTx was compared to RTx alone or tumor alone (n=15 each arm). Result(s): At early stages of tumor formation (<1wk) there is 90% integration of BMDC into the tumor vasculature, while to late stages of tumor growth (>2 wks) only 10% integration of BMDC is seen. At later stages of tumor growth (>2 wks) BMDC incorporation in the tumor vasculature is predominantly seen in the tumor periphery compared to the tumor centre, with the peripheral vessels demonstrating almost 100% integration of BMDC compared to the centre of the tumor where the vasculature have no integration of BMDC. Conclusion(s): Our results are the first to demonstrate that there is a specific tumor growth stage dependent contribution of BMDC to tumor neo-vascularization. At early stages of tumor growth neo-ascularization relies on host BMDC, while at later stages of tumor growth vascularization relies on branching of pre-existing vessels. A significant difference in extent of BMDC integration is noted between periphery versus the centre of the tumor, suggesting that the internal tumor micro-environment regulates neoascularization differently from the periphery. Intriguingly, this distinction is not seen with tumor neovascularization in recurrent tumors following RTx. These results have significant therapeutic implications and point to a need for scheduling of anti-angiogenic therapies according to tumor growth stage and timing post RTx.",Excluded
634,"Hippocampal Sparing Whole Brain Radiotherapy and Integrated Simultaneous Boost vs Stereotactic Radiosurgery Boost: A Comparative Dosimetric Planning Study. BACKGROUND: Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery were frequently used to palliate patients with brain metastases. It remains controversial which modality or combination of therapy is superior especially in the setting of limited number of brain metastases. The availability of newer medical therapy that improves survival highlighted the importance of reducing long term radiation toxicity associated with WBRT. In this study, we aim to demonstrate the hippocampal sparing technique with whole brain and integrated simultaneous boost Materials and Methods: Planning data from 10 patients with 1-5 brain metastases treated with SRS were identified. Based on the contouring guideline from RTOG atlas, we identified and contoured the hippocampus with 5mm isocentric expansion to form the hippocampal avoidance structure. The plan was to deliver hippocampal sparing whole brain radiotherapy (HSWBRT) of 30 Gy in 10 fractions and simultaneous boost to metastatic lesions of 30 Gy in 10 fractions each.RESULTS: The PTV, hippocampus and hippocampal avoidance volumes ranges between 1.00 - 39.00 cc., 2.50 - 5.30 cc and 26.47 - 36.30 cc respectively. The mean hippocampus dose for the HSWBRT and HSWBRT and SIB plans was 8.06 Gy and 12.47 respectively. The max dose of optic nerve, optic chiasm and brainstem were kept below acceptable range of 37.5 Gy.CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this dosimetric study demonstrated the feasibility and safety of treating limited brain metastases with HSWBRT and SIB. It is possible to achieve the best of both worlds by combining HSWBRT and SIB to achieve maximal local intracranial control while maintaining as low a dose as possible to the hippocampus thereby preserving memory and quality of life.",Excluded
465,"Evidence that peripheral rather than intracranial thermal signals induce thermoregulation. Numerous effector mechanisms have been discovered, which change body temperature and thus serve to maintain the thermal integrity of homeothermic animals. These mechanisms are driven by thermal signals that are processed by neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area. To keep a tight control over body temperature, these neurons have to receive accurate thermal information. Although in vitro studies have shown the direct thermosensitive ability of neurons in the preoptic area, other observations suggest the existence of peripheral thermosensation and an ascending thermal pathway to the thermoregulatory center. Direct evidences for either one, or both are still missing. In the present study, brain, rectal, subcutaneous and skin surface temperatures were measured during 15, 30, 60 and 120 min of cold exposure (4 degrees C) in rats and compared with neuronal activation due to cold stress shown by c-fos in situ hybridization histochemistry. Subcutaneous and skin surface temperatures dropped continuously throughout the 120 min of cold exposure by 1.4 degrees C and 6.5 degrees C, respectively. However, during the first 30 min, brain and rectal temperatures increased by 0.3 degrees C and 0.25 degrees C, respectively, and even after 60 min of cold stress, brain temperature did not decrease under the level measured at 0 min. Since the brain temperature did not decrease, it is unlikely that intracranial thermoreceptors are involved in the transmission of ""cold"" thermal signal to induce thermoregulation. At 30 min of cold exposure, neurons in all known thermoregulatory areas (like the ventrolateral part of the medial preoptic nucleus, the lateral retrochiasmatic area, the lateral parabrachial nucleus and the peritrigeminal nucleus) were already maximally activated. These observations clearly indicate that the activation of neurons in the preoptic and several other thermoregulatory nuclei is induced in vivo by thermal signals originating in the periphery, and not in the CNS.",Excluded

72,"Activation of long-term synaptic plasticity causes suppression of epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices. Electrical stimulation of cerebral targets for the treatment of epilepsy is an area under active investigation. Recent studies have shown that chronic stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, fornix, or hippocampus may be effective in attenuating seizure frequency in animal models and in patients with intractable epilepsy. However, many questions exist, such as what are the specific electrical parameters, target sites, and mechanisms, etc., which should be investigated in animal studies before considering the routine use of chronic stimulation in epileptic patients. It is also important to understand what happens to neural activity during repetitive pulse stimulation as well as after stimulation. To this end, we hypothesized: (1) activation of synaptic plasticity suppresses epileptiform activity and (2) low frequency stimulation is an effective stimulation protocol for reducing seizure intensity and frequency. We used rat hippocampal brain slices to study how electrical stimulation affects spontaneous and evoked epileptiform activity. Further, we compared low (1 Hz) versus high (100 Hz) frequency stimulation in the same preparation. We found that orthodromic stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals for 10 min reduces the amplitude of normal responses and diminishes epileptiform activity. The onset of suppression by 1 Hz stimulation was gradual, but persistent, whereas the onset of suppression by 100 Hz was rapid; however, the effects of 100 Hz stimulation were transient. Finally, the NMDA antagonist, AP5 reversed the antiepileptic effects achieved by 1 Hz stimulation. Collectively, these data suggest that using different stimulation parameters prolonged electrical stimulation in the hippocampus may be effective in reducing seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy and that suppression by low frequency stimulation may be mediated by long-term depression (LTD).",Excluded
961,"Oncosurgical management of mono-/multisegmental local recurrences of primary spinal tumors and solitary spinal metastases at the thoracolumbar spine: Results by management with wide en bloc excision. Introduction: Intralesional resection of malignant / aggressive benign tumors and solitary metastases of the spine always results in tumor cell dissemination and local recurrence. Due to the limited radiation tolerance of the spinal cord the option of postoperative radiotherapy is limited often leaving the patient with local recurrence and no chance of surgical therapy. The introduction of en bloc spondylectomie (EBS) allowed for the first time oncologically sufficient resections with adequate local tumor control. However, local recurrence with deranged anatomy, dural / paraspinal scar formation resulting from radiation and intralesional surgery with implants in situ extremely complicates wide re-excisions. This retrospective study aimed to analyse the oncosurgical results of EBS for local recurrences. Material(s) and Method(s): 10 patients (w/m:4 /6; 50.4 (25-71) years) with local tumor recurrence after sarcoma (n=4), chordoma (n=2), renal cell carcinoma , osteoblastoma / RZ-tumor / fibrous dysplasia (n=1, respectively) were included. All patients underwent an intralesional resection (thoracic/lumbar: n=8/2; anterior/ combined anterior-posterior approach: n=5/4 patients) after a mean recurrence free period of 18 (4-45) months before EBS. Two patients had a neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The preoperative staging (open biopsy, PET-CT, MRI) showed no further lesions. The resection was performed as mono- /multisegmental (Level: 1x1, 3x2, 4x3, 2x4, thoracic/lumbar: 8 /2) EBS with extension of resection margins in 4 patients (partial lung/chest wall resection n=2/2). Spinal defect reconstructed was performed with screw-rod systems and carbon composite cage systems. The mean operation time was 735 (224-900) minutes. In 3/6 patients a posterior/combined anterior posterior approach was used. Result(s): The histolopath. results showed 3 wide and 6 marginal R0 resections. In one patient there was an R1 resection. The mean postop. ICU stay was 3 (0-5) days. In 6 of the 10 patients complications occurred (n=2 wound complications, n=1 chylus fistula, n=1 liquor leackage, n=1 lung embolism, n=1 neurological deficit due to spinal cord ischemia). In 9/10 patients the Frankel Grade (6xE, 2xD, 1XC) did not change from pre-to postoperative. In a mean follow-up of 15 months, 8 patients did not have any evidence of disease and 2 patients developed a tumor relapse (1 local recurrence/ 1 pulmonary metastases). The spinal reconstruction did not show any loosening or implant failure. Conclusion(s): Intralesional resection of vertebral sarcoma/ solitary metastases typically results to local tumor recurrence even when postoperative radiation is performed and should be avoided. After the radiation tolerance of spinal cord is reached, excisional surgery with a EBS remains the only sufficient treatment. However, EBS for local recurrence excision is associated with increased risk of potential complications and of neurological deterioration. EBS-surgery of selected cases has to be performed in certain tumor /spine centers.",Excluded
266,"[The action of ionizing radiation on DNA replication in the cells of a healthy human subject and of a patient with Down's syndrome]. Using DNA fiber autoradiography we have revealed a new defect earlier unknown in Down's syndrome but analogous to that earlier shown by the authors in AT and basal cell nevus. This syndrome involves a significantly decreased number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons compared to that in normal cells., the rate of fork movement and the fusion of neighbouring units in the group being unchanged. Ionizing radiation (5 Gy) does not change the rate of DNA chain growth in the cells derived from the affected individuals, however, it significantly reduces this parameter in normal cells due to inhibition of replicon initiation in the whole clusters. Thus, radioresistant DNA synthesis in chromosomal instability syndromes may be explained by some defect in DNA replication in unirradiated cells analogous to that in irradiated normal cells.",Included

Introduction Bone metastases one of the most common presentation of various malignancies and typically associated with a short-term prognosis in cancer patients. These patients primarily visit the clinics with complain of pain with poor quality of life and functional disability. Methods To analyze the demographics, treatment profile and survival of cases treated in different centers combined. A total of 500 patients with symptomatic bone metastases were studied retrospectively over the period of 4 years from 2013 to 2017. Results The median age of presentation was 50 years. The most common primary cancer associated with bonemetastasis were prostate (32%), breast (35%) and lung (30%). Almost 75% cases of bone metastasis in female patients encountered due to breast followed by cervix and lung. The predominant reason for clinical presentation was bony and/or neuropathic pain (70%), followed by pathological fracture (20%), including spinal cord compression and fracture impending associated with or without soft tissue mass (10%). Out of 410, 30% had synchronous visceral metastasis to single or multiple sites like brain, lung and liver. 90% cases received palliative radiation with multiple radiation dosing schedules, decided a per the patient's general conditions. The median survival observed was 12-60 months in prostate, 7-15 months in lung; 12-30 months in breast cancer and 20 months in thyroid. Conclusions 80% patients had symptomatic improvement with continuous pain management, 90% of patients had improved QOL. Overall bone metastases from primary cancers have poor survival but it is still possible to maintain a good quality of life with prompt diagnosis and proper symptomatic management.",Excluded
570,"CBCT-guided Winston Lutz test. Purpose/Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of the radiation isocenter of a linac when a Winston Lutz (WL) test is performed using the CBCT as a localization tool for the target. Material(s) and Method(s): A Varian 2100 CD linac equipped witha 120 MLC, aSi 500 EPID and OBI system (v 1.5). A phantom containing a central tungsten ball (5 mm diameter) mimicking a target is used. The phantom was CT scanned in a Siemens Somaton scanner (planning CT, pCT) and imported into the Eclipse TPS (v. 10.0). The tungsten ball was delineated and a no-coplanar plan (WL plan) was added with its isocenter located at the ball center. The WL plan consisted of 10 smallfields (6X) of 2x2 cm size collimated with the Millennium 120 MLC of the linac (G0T0,G140T315, G140T270, G180T0, G220T90, G220T45, G270T0, G270T45, G90T0 and G90T315,where G: gantry and T: table, scale: Varian IEC). The WL plan includes a CBCT field setup. The phantom was setup in the linac by aligning the ball center with the room lasers. After that, intended shifts within +/- 1 cm were applied alongside the three translational directions of the table, in order to simulate a setup error of the phantom. CBCT was acquired (Gantryrotation: 360degree, FOV: 45 cm, matrix: 512x512 and slice distance: 1 mm) and 3D/3D match was performed using the pCTas reference. The required couch movements to correct the actual position ofthe target were applied in a remote way. After that, the WL plan was delivered and an integrated MV image for each field was acquired using the EPID. EPID was positioned at 80 cm below the linac isocenter, giving a pixel size of 0.4 mm. The WL plan was irradiated twelve times during a year (118 shots/images). Each recorded MV image was analysed with ImageJ software in order to measure the distance (2D) between the ball center and the field center. Each 2D distance was decomposed into the three anatomical directions (Left/Right, Anterior/Posterior and Superior/Inferior). Result(s): The analysis of the 118 MV images collected reported the following differences (mean and 95% CI) between the ball center and the radiation center: 1) L/R : 0.6 mm [95% CI: 1.4 mm] 2) AP/PA : 0.5 mm [95% CI: 1.2 mm] 3) Sup/Inf: 0.7 mm [95% CI: 1.6 mm] Conclusion(s): The isocenter accuracy was within 2 mm on each direction, when the CBCT technique is used for target localization. The results found in this study included inaccuracies due to gantry and couch rotations, remote couch movements and potential misalignments between the linac and the OBI isocenters.

741,"The radiation therapy options of intracranial hemangiopericytoma: An overview and update on a rare vascular mesenchymal tumor. Hemangiopericytoma (HPC) is an extremely rare hypervascu-lar tumor of mesenchymal lineage. It tends to recur and to develop distant metastases even many years after primary surgical resection. The management of recurrent and metastatic disease is not always so well defined. A complete surgical resection does not eliminate the high risk of local recurrences that occur in the central nervous system, often in the same surgical bed. However, treatment with adjuvant radiotherapy even in cases of complete resection remains controversial. Because of its rarity, there is no standard for treatment. We focused on radiotherapy treatment options, analyzing the literature and making a base on conduct further studies to establish the standard radiation dose to be used for locoregional control of such a complex and extremely rare disease and to help specialists to take the most appropriate therapeutic option. © Copyright M.P,Ciliberti et al., 2018.",Excluded
150,"Effect of microradiosurgical transections upon kainate seizure focus. Multiple subpial transections (MST) sever horizontal intracortical fibers involved in the propagation of seizures, while preserving vertical fibers which are essential for brain function. Less damaging to the brain than a traditional resection,MST still exposes patients to the risks of craniotomy. Microradiosurgery uses synchrotron generated sub-millimetric beams of radiation. Arrays of tightly spaced microbeams produce a lethal effect only to those cells directly in the beam path. Low energy x-rays used for microradiosurgery have a small tissue half-value layer making the technique ideal for treating superficial brain lesions. Video-EEG (VEEG) data was recorded immediately following kainate injected into sensorimotor cortex. Rats then underwent irradiation with an array of parallel microbeams delivered to the seizure focus.Subclinical electrographic ictal events remained frequent up to 10 hours post irradiation. More prolonged seizures exhibited typical rat complex partial seizure semiologies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recording VEEG before and after precise microbeam irradiation from a synchrotron source; demonstrating a methodology which will be useful for future experiments serving to optimize microbeam doses and configuration in preparation for the treatment of epilepsy in humans. The results show some promise that microradiosurgical MST can limit the spread of seizures without causing clinically evident neurological damage.",Excluded

178,"Phase measurement of cognitive impairment specific to radiotherapy. PURPOSE: Memory impairment is an early-delayed effect of radiotherapy (RT). The prospective longitudinal measurement of the cognitive phase effects from RT was conducted on treated and untreated brain tumor patients. The study design investigated semantic vs. perceptual and visual vs. verbal memory to determine the most disease-specific measure of RT-related changes and understanding of the neurotoxicity from RT to the brain.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tests of memory that had previously shown RT-related phasic changes were compared with experimental tests of memory to test hypotheses about cognition targeted to the neural toxicity of RT. The results from 41 irradiated and 29 nonirradiated patients with low-grade, supratentorial tumors were analyzed. The methods controlled for comorbid white matter risk, recurrence, interval after treatment, and age (18-69 years). The effects were examined before RT and at three points after RT to 1 year using a mixed effects model that included interval, group, surgical status, medication use, practice, and individual random effects. Four new tests of memory and other candidate cognitive tests were investigated, and a post hoc analysis of a comprehensive battery of tests was performed to identify the cognitive processes most specific to RT.RESULTS: The RT effects on memory were identified in the treated group only; among the new tests of memory and the complete neurocognitive battery, the RT effects were significant only for delayed recall (p < 0.009) and interval to recognize (p < 0.002). Tumor location was not related to the treatment effect. Memory decline was specific to retrieval of semantic memories; a double dissociation of semantic from perceptual visual memory was demonstrated in the RT group.CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate memory dependent on the semantic cortex and the hippocampal memory system. A cognitive measurement that is brief but specific to neural mechanisms is effective and feasible for studies of RT damage.",Included

12,"CT perfusion in acute ischemic stroke: a comparison of 2-second and 1-second temporal resolution. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT perfusion data sets are commonly acquired using a temporal resolution of 1 image per second. To limit radiation dose and allow for increased spatial coverage, the reduction of temporal resolution is a possible strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of reduced temporal resolution in CT perfusion scans with regard to color map quality, quantitative perfusion parameters, ischemic lesion extent, and clinical decision-making when using DC and MS algorithms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: CTP datasets from 50 patients with acute stroke were acquired with a TR of 1 second. Two-second TR datasets were created by removing every second image. Various perfusion parameters (CBF, CBV, MTT, TTP, TTD) and color maps were calculated by using identical data-processing settings for 2-second and 1-second TR. Color map quality, quantitative region-of-interest-based perfusion measurements, and TAR/NVT lesions (indicated by CBF/CBV mismatch) derived from the 2-second and 1-second processed data were statistically compared.RESULTS: Color map quality was similar for 2-second versus 1-second TR when using DC and was reduced when using MS. Regarding quantitative values, differences between 2-second and 1-second TR datasets were statistically significant by using both algorithms. Using DC, corresponding tissue-at-risk lesions were slightly smaller at 2-second versus 1-second TR (P < .05), whereas corresponding NVT lesions showed excellent agreement. With MS, corresponding tissue-at-risk lesions showed excellent agreement but more artifacts, whereas NVT lesions were larger (P < .001) compared with 1-second TR. Therapeutic decisions would have remained the same in all patients.CONCLUSIONS: CTP studies obtained with 2-second TR are typically still diagnostic, and the same therapy would have been provided. However, with regard to perfusion quantitation and image-quality-based confidence, our study indicates that 1-second TR is preferable to 2-second TR.",Excluded
1083,"Risk factors for cerebrovascular deaths in patients operated and irradiated for pituitary tumors. Vascular mortality, especially cerebrovascular disease (CVD), are the most pronounced cause of mortality in women with hypopituitarism. In a cohort of 342 patients operated and irradiated for pituitary tumors, 31 died from CVD (CVD patients) between 1952 and 1996. The study assessed whether the radiation regimens and duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation differed between the 31 CVD patients and the 62 matched patients from the same cohort who had not died from CVD (control patients). Furthermore, the infarction/hemorrhage ratio, type of clinical stroke syndrome, and time to death after stroke were investigated in the CVD patients and in matched controls from the general population who had died from CVD (population controls). No significant differences in maximum or centrally absorbed dose, maximum or central biological equivalent dose, field size, or number of fraction were recorded between CVD and control patients. A significant difference in the duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation was recorded, but only in women (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the infarction/hemorrhage ratio (P > 0.3) of lacunar or posterior circulation syndrome compared with middle cerebral artery syndrome with cortical features (P = 0.22) or the proportion of patients who died within the first month after stroke onset (60% vs. 59%, respectively) between CVD patients and population controls. In conclusion, no significant effect on CVD deaths could be detected for any radiation parameter. A long history of unsubstituted pituitary insufficiency may be a contributing factor to the very high CVD mortality among women. There were no indications of significant differences in type of stroke, clinical stroke syndromes, or stroke fatality between the CVD patients and the population controls.",Excluded

Background: A modern treatment approach for non-resected NSCLC comprises radiation dose intensification and short overall treatment times. We report on patients treated within a prospective trial, correlating doses to tumor volume, combined with chemotherapy sequentially. Method(s): Radiation doses to primary tumors were aligned along increasing tumor size within 4 groups (<2.5 cm/ 2.5-4.5 cm/ 4.5- 6.0 cm/ >6.0 cm; mean number of three perpendicular diameters). ICRU-doses of 73.8 Gy/ 79.2 Gy/ 84.6 Gy/ 90.0 Gy, respectively, were applied. Macroscopically involved nodes were treated with a median dose of 59.4 Gy, nodal sites about 6 cm cranial to involved nodes electively with 45 Gy. Fractional doses were 1.8 Gy twice daily (bid). 2 cycles chemotherapy were given before radiotherapy; the interval between chemotherapy and radiotherapy was prefe- rentially shorter than 8 days. With a median follow up time of 56.1 months (range 43.2 - 97.1 ) for patients alive, mature results for locoregional tumor control, survival and toxicity are presented. Result(s): Between 2004 and 2009,123 continuously referred, unselected patients with 127 histologically/ cytologically proven NSCLC were enrolled; Stage II: 6 pts.; IIIA: 70 pts.; IIIB: 47 pts. Weight loss >5%/ 3 months: 26%; Karnofsky Index <= 70%: 46% of the patients. The local tumor control rate at 2-/ 5 years is 73%/ 70%, respectively; the regional tumor control rate 91%/ 89%, respectively. The median overall survival time is 24.6 months, the 2- and 5-year overall survival rates are 52% and 19%, respectively. 2 treatment-related deaths (progressive pulmonary fibrosis) occurred in patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis. Further toxicity was mild or moderate: Pneumonitis grade 2/ 3 (n=10/ 6); esophagitis grade 2/ 3 (n=16/ 7). Lung late grade 2 (n=13), esophagus late grade 3 (n=1).

The induced fields in the phantom material are measured. Set up to lift the plane carrying the mobile phone is run by a pulley whose motion is controlled by a stepper motor. The platform is made to move at a pre-determined rate of 2degree per min limited up to 20degree. The measured data for induced fields in various locations are used to compute corresponding SAR values and inter comparison obtained. These data are also compared with those when the mobile phone is placed horizontally with respect to the position of the animal. The SAR data is also experimentally obtained by measuring a rise in temperature due to this mobile exposures and data compared with those obtained in the previous set. To seek a comparison with the safety criteria same set of measurements are performed in 10 g phantom material contained in a cubical box.

305,"Patient-Specific Screening Using High-Grade Glioma Explants to Determine Potential Radiosensitization by a TGF-beta Small Molecule Inhibitor. High-grade glioma (HGG), a deadly primary brain malignancy, manifests radioresistance mediated by cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental mechanisms. High levels of the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in HGG promote radioresistance by enforcing an effective DNA damage response and supporting glioma stem cell self-renewal. Our analysis of HGG TCGA data and immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated Smad2, which is the main transducer of canonical TGF-beta signaling, indicated variable levels of TGF-beta pathway activation across HGG tumors. These data suggest that evaluating the putative benefit of inhibiting TGF-beta during radiotherapy requires personalized screening. Thus, we used explant cultures of seven HGG specimens as a rapid, patient-specific ex vivo platform to test the hypothesis that LY364947, a small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-beta type I receptor, acts as a radiosensitizer in HGG. Immunofluorescence detection and image analysis of gamma-H2AX foci, a marker of cellular recognition of radiation-induced DNA damage, and Sox2, a stem cell marker that increases post-radiation, indicated that LY364947 blocked these radiation responses in five of seven specimens. Collectively, our findings suggest that TGF-beta signaling increases radioresistance in most, but not all, HGGs. We propose that short-term culture of HGG explants provides a flexible and rapid platform for screening context-dependent efficacy of radiosensitizing agents in patient-specific fashion. This time- and cost-effective approach could be used to personalize treatment plans in HGG patients.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As late radiotherapy toxicity impacts negatively on the quality-of-life of cancer survivors and is often under reported, a study was set up to prospectively collect patient-reported data in an unselected series of patients with gynaecological malignancy. Aim 1 - To provide 3 year results for the longitudinal study. Aim 2 - To improve the questionnaire used to collect data by identifying redundant items and modifying for use to collect Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) data.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Aim 1 - Patient reported outcome data were collected prospectively by 226 patients before and up to 3 years following radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer using a questionnaire developed to collect LENT subjective data. Aim 2 - A factor analysis was performed to identify which questions gave the most and least information.RESULTS: Aim 1 - Faecal urgency and incontinence (all grades) peaked at 79% and 24%, respectively at 1 year then settled to 69% and 18% at 3 years, respectively. Urinary urgency (all grades) increased with time and was described in 75% at 3 years. Other symptoms reported at 3 years include diarrhoea in 12%, urinary incontinence in 27% and vaginal dryness in 29%. A third of patients did not feel their sex life had changed following treatment, while a quarter felt that it had. Aim 2 - some questions overlapped and others were non-specific. The questionnaire has subsequently been altered.CONCLUSIONS: The extent of late toxicity is substantial. This detailed information is important for both patients and clinicians in terms of treatment decisions and follow-up care. The LENT questionnaire provides a feasible tool for capture of this information in the clinic.",Excluded

ATM, mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), plays a central role in the response to DNA double strand breaks and patients with this disorder are characterised by extreme sensitivity to radiation, increased risk of cancer and neurodegeneration. Thus, ATM represents a potential target for radiosensitization of brain tumour cells. A safe, non-replicating lentivirus is used to abrogate ATM in GBM through the antisense and RNAi approaches for radiosensitization. With either techniques, ATM protein was reduced by >90% and there was a 3-fold sensitization of GBM cells to radiation. ATM protein activation as well as ATM pS1981 foci formation were defective and downstream signalling determined by Ser15 phosphorylation on p53 was reduced. Success in the approaches provides a novel and exciting strategy for the treatment of GBM and thus improving the survival of patients with these tumours.",Excluded
1076,"Postradiation osteonecrosis of the mandible: a long-term follow-up study. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the long-term progress of 26 patients who experienced postradiation osteonecrosis of the jaw between 1975 and 1989.STUDY DESIGN: Of 26 patients who had been previously managed with hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a part of their treatment for postradiation osteonecrosis of the jaw, 20 were evaluated to determine their current status of the condition: resolved, chronic persisting (unresolved), or active progressive (symptomatic).RESULTS: Two of 20 patients experienced recurrences of the condition. In one of these patients, surgical treatment was identified as the stimulus of postradiation osteonecrosis. In the other patient, the recurrence appeared to be related to periodontal disease activity. In 60% (12 of 20) of the patients, the condition remained resolved, improvement in clinical staging occurred in 10% (2 of 20) (from symptomatic to unresolved or resolved), and 20% (5 of 20) of the patients continued to demonstrate chronic persisting postradiation osteonecrosis at the end of the long-term follow-up period.CONCLUSION: This study supports the contention that postradiation osteonecrosis can occur at any time after radiation therapy, and that patients remain at risk up to 231 months after treatment of the cancer and probably indefinitely after radiation therapy. Our findings also suggest that risk of second episodes of the condition after management of an initial episode is low. In addition, our follow-up study revealed that chronic nonprogressive postradiation osteonecrosis can remain stable without extensive intervention including combined hyperbaric oxygen therapy and surgery.",Excluded
565,"Open-label, randomized phase II, of concurrent whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and capecitabine (Xelodaw) followed by maintenance capecitabine compared with standard wbrt in breast cancer patients with newly diagnosed brain metastasis: The xerad trial. BACKGROUND: Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is considered as the standard of care for breast cancer patients (pts) with CNS metastasis. The role of chemotherapy in these patients is still not clearly defined. Capecitabine (Xelodaw) alone has shown some efficacy, and the use of capecitabine concurrent with WBRT has been suggested as a radiosensitizer. This trial was design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine administered concurrently with WBRT, compared to WBRT. METHOD(S): In this multicenter, national, phase II study, 130 pts were planned to be randomized in two arms: Arm A: WBRT (3000 cGy in 10 single daily fractions) followed by standard of care (capecitabine and 5-FU analogues not allowed); Arm B: WBRT and concurrent capecitabine (825 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/twice daily X 14days) followed by capecitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/ twice daily, days 1-14 every 21 days) as maintenance treatment. The main inclusion criteria were: age over 18, ECOG performance status 0 - 2, histologically confirmed breast cancer, newly diagnosed CNS metastasis non eligible for surgery or radiosurgery, no previous treatment for CNS metastases, and no treatment with capecitabine at time of inclusion. The primary objective was the best objective partial or complete CNS response rate according to RECIST criteria after central review. Secondary criteria included overall survival and safety. RESULT(S): The study was terminated earlier due to a slow recruitment rate over a 1 yearperiod. The ITT population comprised 23 patients: 12 in Arm A and 11 in Arm B. The majority of the patients (78%) presented with invasive ductal carcinomas. Patients in Arm B were slightly more limited: 27% were fully active compared to 46% of the patients in Arm A. The objective CNS response rate was higher in arm B (36%) than in arm A (25%) but the median overall survival was higher in arm A (9.8 months - 95%CI[4.3-17.0]) than in arm B (4.6 months - 95%CI[2.3-8.9]). The most frequently reported AEs were headaches (6 pts in each arm ), asthenia (7 pts in arm A, 5 in arm B), nausea (4 pts in arm A, 5 in arm B), scalp radiation reactions (6 pts in arm A, 2 in arm B); vomiting (1 pt in arm A, 6 in arm B) and diarrheas (1 pt in arm A, 3 in arm B). Twelve patients (52%), six in each arm, experienced SAEs. The most frequent SAE was ""general physical health deterioration"" (three patients). Two SAEs were considered related to capecitabine: colitis and pulmonary embolism and led to permanent treatment discontinuation and one SAE in Arm B was considered related to WBRT: depressed level of consciousness. Capecitabine was generally well tolerated, nausea being the most frequent AE leading to dose reduction and three patients had to stop the treatment because of capecitabine-related AEs. CONCLUSION(S): This trial revealed no safety signal for concomitant treatment with WBRT and Capecitabine. Unfortunately, the limited number of patients included in this study impedes any definitive conclusion on efficacy.",Excluded
996,"Low-grade gliomas in adults. Adult patients with a magnetic resonance scan suggestive of a supratentorial low-grade glioma should generally undergo at least a stereotactic biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and rule out an anaplastic glioma or a non-neoplastic lesion. Early tumor treatment should be given to patients with newly diagnosed low-grade gliomas who are over age 50 years, those who have headaches or neurologic deficits other than seizures, or those whose neuroimaging studies show tumor growth or mass effect. For younger patients presenting with seizures and no other neurologic symptoms, it is reasonable to defer therapy until there is clinical or radiographic tumor progression. When it is judged that intervention is necessary, patients should undergo to maximal surgical tumor resection, which preserves or improves neurologic function. For younger (<50 years) astrocytoma patients with a good tumor resection, radiation may be deferred until tumor progression. Early radiation should be given to astrocytoma patients who are older than 50 years of age at diagnosis (regardless of the type of surgery) or to younger patients who are judged to require early intervention but who are not candidates for aggressive surgical resection. The radiation dose for low-grade glioma should be 4500 to 5000 cGy, preferably with three-dimensional conformal ports. The same guidelines for management apply to patients with low-grade oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma, except that chemotherapy is a reasonable alternative to radiation when it is judged that treatment other than surgical resection is required.

1067,"Brain photodiagnosis (PD), fluorescence guided resection (FGR) and photodynamic therapy (PDT): Past, present and future. Intracranial tumours are an excellent target for photodiagnosis (PD), fluorescence guided resection (FGR) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), because the tumour to brain ratio of photosensitizers' concentration is very high. However, several attempts of proving the value of PDT in the most malignant type of brain tumours, gliobastoma multeforme (GBM) failed to demonstrate any significant worthwhile survival advantage in the past because of the very nature of this cancer and several compounding factors that led to this apparent disappointing outcome; variations in the photosensitizer and light dosages, variations in the photosensitizer administration to treatment time-intervals, and variations in photosensitizers used are just few to mention in this article. However, after a very long gestation period of brain PD, FGR and PDT, three randomized controlled trials (RCT) in brain PD, FGR and PDT were concluded by 2007. The first trial demonstrated that time to tumour progression (TTP) was significantly longer in patients who had PD and FGR compared to standard surgical resection but this difference did not translate into survival advantage in GBM due to the variability in the management of recurrent tumours and significant residual tumour cells left after FGR in about a third of patients leading to GBM relapse. The second trial compared single shot PDT in GBM and standard therapy. Neither the treatment nor the control group received PD or FGR. Again this RCT did not provide any survival advantage in patients who had had PDT due to the fact that standard surgical resection had left significant residual tumour in a large number of patients canceling any potential benefit from PDT. The last trial compared combined PD, FGR and repetitive PDT and standard therapy and confirmed that TTP was significantly longer in the treatment group and demonstrated that the treatment group had significant survival advantage in GBM. In conclusion, PD, FGR and PDT need to be combined to be effective in brain tumours and in the future, we will see more and more scientific evidence accumulating in support of brain PD, FGR and PDT. The next decade will see further refinement and evolution of the techniques and technology employed and expansion of the indications of brain PD, FGR and PDT. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1078,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome in a patient receiving anticonvulsant therapy during cranial irradiation. A 28-year-old female patient with a recent history of breast carcinoma was referred to our clinic with generalized necrotic skin eruptions and severe mucosal erosions, which developed right after the completion of cranial radiotherapy for brain metastases. She had been receiving prophylactic diphenylhydantoin treatment 100 mg three times daily during radiation therapy. The extensive involvement of the oral mucosa with conjunctivitis and synechiae of the eyelids, facial swelling, and extension of the rash over the trunk and shoulders with bullous detachment of less than 10% of the total body surface strongly suggested Stevens-Johnson syndrome caused by phenytoin treatment in our patient. There has been conflicting evidence on the role of radiotherapy in the increased risk of severe drug reactions. Although various authors have emphasized the augmented rate of severe mucocutaneous reactions caused by anticonvulsants given during radiotherapy and suggested discontinuing the prophylactic use of such drugs in patients with no history of seizures, others have argued in favor of prophylactic anticonvulsants. Given the high risk of seizures, reaching 20% in patients with brain tumors, and the low incidence of drug reactions, the suggestion of refraining from prophylactic anticonvulsants in the setting of primary or metastatic brain tumors is controversial.",Excluded
799,"Repeated head CT in the neurosurgical intensive care unit: feasibility of sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction-based ultra-low-dose CT for surveillance. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit undergo multiple head CT scans, resulting in high cumulative radiation exposures. Our aim was to assess the acceptability of a dedicated, special-purpose sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction-based ultra-low-dose CT protocol for neurosurgical intensive care unit surveillance head CT examinations, comparing image quality with studies performed with our standard-of-care sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction low-dose CT and legacy filtered back-projection standard-dose CT protocols.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 54 head CT examinations: ultra-low-dose CT (n = 22), low-dose CT (n = 12), and standard-dose CT (n = 20) in 22 patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. Standard-dose CT was reconstructed by using filtered back-projection on a Somatom Sensation 64 scanner. Ultra-low-dose CT and ultra-low-dose CT examinations were performed on a Siemens AS+128 scanner with commercially available sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative parameters, including image quality and dose, were evaluated.RESULTS: Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction ultra-low-dose CT represented a 68% lower dose index volume compared with filtered back-projection standard-dose CT techniques in the same patients while maintaining similar quality and SNR levels. Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction low-dose CT offered higher image quality than filtered back-projection standard-dose CT (P < .05) with no differences in SNR at a 24% lower dose index volume. Compared with low-dose CT, ultra-low-dose CT had significantly lower SNR (P = .001) but demonstrated clinically satisfactory measures of image quality.CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit, dedicated ultra-low-dose CT for surveillance head CT imaging led to a significant dose reduction while maintaining adequate image quality.",Excluded
452,"Effects of oxygen and bFGF on the vulnerability of photoreceptors to light damage. PURPOSE: To test whether tissue oxygen levels affect the vulnerability of photoreceptors to damage by bright continuous light (BCL).METHODS: Albino rats were raised in standard conditions of cyclic light (12-hour light, 12-hour darkness) with the light level at 5 to 10 lux or 40 to 65 lux. They were then exposed to BCL (1000-1400 lux), either continuously for 48 hours or for the day or night components of the 48-hour period. During BCL, some rats were kept in room air (normoxia, 21% oxygen), some in hypoxia (10%), and some in hyperoxia (70%). Their retinas were examined for cell death, for the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and for response to light (electroretinogram, ERG).RESULTS: The death of retinal cells induced by BCL was confined to photoreceptors. Within the retina, the severity of death was inversely related to the level of bFGF immunolabeling in the somas of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) before exposure. The death of photoreceptors was accompanied by an upregulation of bFGF protein levels in the ONL and by a decline in the ERG. Both hypoxia and hyperoxia during BCL reduced the photoreceptor death, bFGF upregulation, and ERG decline caused by BCL. The protective effects of hyperoxia and hypoxia were evident during both the day and night halves of the daily cycle. Hypoxia or hyperoxia alone did not upregulate bFGF or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) expression in the retina.CONCLUSIONS: Photoreceptors are protected from light damage by hypoxia and hyperoxia during exposure. The protection provided by oxygen levels operates during both day and night. The protection is not mediated by an upregulation of bFGF or CNTF.",Excluded

Background An unusual presentation of endometrial cancer with infection by Trueperella bernardiae. Case A 70-year-old female with a significant history of weight loss and abdominal pain presented as an emergency with a peritonitic abdomen. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large uterine mass and pneumoperitoneum. Subsequent laparotomy found an enlarged uterus with necrosis and purulent exudate with no evidence of bowel perforation. This required a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Microscopy and culture of the peritoneal fluid produced a heavy growth of Clostridium ramosum and Trueperella bernardiae. Sensitivities included pip/tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Histology showed an extensively necrotic Stage 3A Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. This patient was septic on admission and suffered an acute kidney injury. Following recovery from surgery, treatment under the gynaecological oncology team will include chemotherapy, externalbeam radiation and brachytherapy. Conclusion This case is unusual as the initial clinical presentation suggested bowel perforation. This patient also suffered an unusual infection with Clostridium ramosum and Trueperella bernardiae, the latter is a very uncommon isolation. The CT scan showed a pneumoperitoneum which led to the suspicion of bowel perforation. At subsequent laparotomy, no evidence of bowel perforation was noted. The findings of pneumoperitoneum could be explained by culture findings of Clostridium ramosum resulting in a gas forming infection within the necrotic uterine mass. There are very few published case reports describing the clinical manifestations of Trueperella bernardiae, a facultative anaerobic gram-positive coccobacilli. Trueperella bernardiae can be a part of the regular skin flora however it has been the reported pathogen in cases of urinary tract infections, septic arthritis, diabetic foot infection, soft tissue infection, brain abscess and eye infections.

Both induction chemotherapy and concurrent platinating agents have been shown to improve results of thoracic irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This phase II study investigated activity and feasibility of a novel chemoradiation regimen, including platinum and paclitaxel, both as induction chemotherapy and concurrently with thoracic radiotherapy. Previously untreated patients with histologically/cytologically proven unresectable stage I-III NSCLC were eligible. Induction chemotherapy consisted of 2 courses of 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> paclitaxel and carboplatin at AUC of 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks. From day 43, continuous thoracic irradiation (60 Gy in 30 fractions radiotherapy for 6 weeks) was given concurrently with daily cisplatin at a dose of 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously and weekly paclitaxel at a dose of 45 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 6 weeks. Fifteen patients were accrued in the first stage of the trial. According to the previous statistical considerations, accrual at the second stage of the study was halted as a result of the achievement an insufficient number of successes. Major toxicity of combined chemoradiation was grade III-IV esophagitis requiring hospitalization for artificial nutrition, which occurred in 58% of patients. Other toxicities included grade II-IV fatigue in 75% of patients and grade I-IV neuromuscular toxicity in 67%. Only 7 patients completed the treatment program as scheduled. Eight patients (53.3%; 95% confidence interval, 26.5-78.7%) had a major response (5 partial response, 3 complete response), 2 patients had disease progression, and 1 was stable at the end of treatment. Four patients died early. With a median follow up of 38 months, the median survival was 12 months. A combined chemoradiation program, including platinum and paclitaxel, appears difficult to deliver at full dose as a result of toxicity, mainly esophagitis.

831,"Optimised GMP-compliant production of [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 on the Trasis AllinOne module. Background: The translocator protein 18 kDa is recognised as an important biomarker for neuroinflammation due to its soaring expression in microglia. This process is common for various neurological disorders. DPA-714 is a potent TSPO-specific ligand which found its use in Positron Emission Tomography following substitution of fluorine-19 with fluorine-18, a positron-emitting radionuclide. [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 enables visualisation of inflammatory processes in vivo non-invasively. Radiolabelling of this tracer is well described in literature, including validation for clinical use. Here, we report significant enhancements to the process which resulted in the design of a fully GMP-compliant robust synthesis of [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 on a popular cassette-based system, Trasis AllinOne, boosting reliability, throughput, and introducing a significant degree of simplicity. Result(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 was synthesised using the classic nucleophilic aliphatic substitution on a good leaving group, tosylate, with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoride using tetraethylammonium bicarbonate in acetonitrile at 100<sup></sup>C. The process was fully automated on a Trasis AllinOne synthesiser using an in-house designed cassette and sequence.

766,"Skilled motor learning does not enhance long-term depression in the motor cortex in vivo. Learning of motor skills may occur as a consequence of changes in the efficacy of synaptic connections in the primary motor cortex. We investigated if learning in a reaching task affects the excitability, short-term plasticity, and long-term plasticity of horizontal connections in layers II-III of the motor cortex. Because training in this task requires animals to be food-deprived, we compared the trained animals with similarly food-deprived untrained animals and normal controls. The results show that the excitability, short-term plasticity, and long-term plasticity of the studied horizontal connections were unaffected by motor learning. However, stress-related effects produced by food deprivation and handling significantly enhanced the expression of long-term depression in these pathways. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the acquisition of a complex motor skill produces bi-directional changes in synaptic strength that are distributed throughout the complex neural networks of motor cortex, which remains synaptically balanced during learning. The results are incompatible with the idea that learning causes large unidirectional changes in the population response of these neural networks, which may occur instead during certain behavioral states, such as stress.",Excluded

The intracellular transport of receptor tyrosine kinases results in the differential activation of various signaling pathways. In this study, optogenetic stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 (FGFR1) was performed to study the effects of subcellular targeting of receptor kinases on signaling and neurite outgrowth. The catalytic domain of FGFR1 fused to the algal light-oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV) domain was directed to different cellular compartments (plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus) in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Blue light stimulation elevated the pERK and pPLCgamma1 levels in membrane-opto-FGFR1-transfected cells similarly to ligand-induced receptor activation; however, no changes in pAKT levels were observed. PC12 cells transfected with membrane-opto-FGFR1 exhibited significantly longer neurites after light stimulation than after growth factor treatment, and significantly more neurites extended from their cell bodies. The activation of cytoplasmic FGFR1 kinase enhanced ERK signaling in HEK293 cells but not in PC12 cells and did not induce neuronal differentiation. The stimulation of FGFR1 kinase in the nucleus also did not result in signaling changes or neurite outgrowth. We conclude that FGFR1 kinase needs to be associated with membranes to induce the differentiation of PC12 cells mainly via ERK activation.",Excluded

Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) starts at 2 weeks after 1st infusion of bevacizumab and continues for 5 weeks. Total mesorectal excision is planned at 6-8 weeks post CRT. Immunohistochemical staining to study the functionality of blood vessels and Luminex analyses to assess the changes in circulating VEGF ligands are performed on tissues and blood samples from consenting pts. Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, safety profile and identification of biomarkers for early response prediction are the main endpoints. Result(s): Sixty five pts with median age 60 have been enrolled to date. Fifty seven pts completed the full protocol scheme, with a relative dose intensity of 97% for bevacizumab, 95% for capecitabine and 93% for oxaliplatin. Preliminary safety data from 60 evaluable pts show that the regimen is generally well tolerated. Most severe adverse events were post-operative (wound infections, leaks) in 9 pts, equally distributed between arms. During CRT, grade 3 toxicities were more frequent in Arm A: fatigue (1), diarrhea (2), infection (2), febrile neutropenia (1), sensory neuropathy (1). Two pts deceased due to disease progression and one due to lung embolism post-surgery. Fifty two pts are evaluable for response. pCR was seen in 11 pts, 30% (8/26) in Arm A and 12% (3/26) in Arm B (p = 0.08).

BACKGROUND: Currently available information about patients with posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy is insufficient to determine what to do about eyes that become blind as a consequence of the tumour and its treatment. Should they be enucleated, or is ocular preservation just as good in terms of survival?METHODS: We performed a retrospective survival analysis of secondary enucleation versus ocular preservation in patients with a posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy whose irradiated eye became completely blind following that treatment. Of the 79 patients who fulfilled defined inclusion criteria, 25 underwent secondary enucleation of the blind eye, and 54 retained their irradiated blind eye.RESULTS: Most of the baseline demographic and tumour-related variables evaluated were similarly distributed between the subgroups. The 5-year, 10-year and 15-year all-cause death rates in the secondary enucleation subgroup were 24.7%, 51.5% and 52.0% respectively, and those in the ocular preservation subgroup were 7.4%, 32.9% and 48.1% respectively. In spite of the apparent slight difference between the curves, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.41, Mantel-Haenszel test).INTERPRETATION: Although a retrospective study of this type has several limitations, our results suggest that secondary enucleation is not likely to substantially improve survival of patients whose irradiated eye becomes totally blind following plaque radiotherapy for choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanoma.",Excluded

PURPOSE: [11C]Cimbi-36 was recently developed as an agonist radioligand for brain imaging of serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2A) with positron emission tomography (PET). This may be used to quantify the high-affinity state of 5-HT2A receptors and may have the potential to quantify changes in cerebral 5-HT levels in vivo. We here investigated safety aspects related to clinical use of [11C]Cimbi-36, including radiation dosimetry and in vivo pharmacology.PROCEDURES: [11C]Cimbi-36 was injected in rats or pigs, and radiation dosimetry was examined by ex vivo dissection or with PET scanning, respectively. Based on animal data, the Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment software was used to estimate extrapolated human dosimetry for [11C]Cimbi-36. The 5-HT2A receptor agonist actions of [11C]Cimbi-36 in vivo pharmacological effects in mice elicited by increasing doses of Cimbi-36 were assessed with the head-twitch response (HTR).RESULTS: The effective dose as extrapolated from both rat and pig data was low, 7.67 and 4.88 muSv/MBq, respectively. In addition, the estimated absorbed radiation dose to human target organs did not exceed safety levels. Administration of 0.5 mg/kg Cimbi-36 leads to significant HTR compared to saline, whereas 0.05 mg/kg Cimbi-36 (doses much larger than those given in conjunction with a PET scan) did not elicit a significant HTR.CONCLUSIONS: Administration of tracer doses of [11C]Cimbi-36 does not seem to be associated with unusual radiation burden or adverse clinical effects.",Excluded

Eighteen patients received conditioning treatment with high-dose (HD) chemotherapy, and four had full dose total body irradiation (fTBI) and HD chemotherapy prior to undergoing an allogeneic or autologous HSCT. The results showed a significant decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in diffuse WM regions one year after HSCT (p-corrected <0.05) in the patient group compared to healthy controls. At baseline, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had higher MD and AD in the left hemisphere WM than autologous HSCT patients (p-corrected <0.05). One year post-transplant, patients treated with allogeneic HSCT had lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in the right hemisphere and left frontal WM compared to patients treated with autologous HSCT (p-corrected <0.05). There were modest but significant correlations between MD values and cognitive test scores, and these were greatest for timed tests and in projection tracts. Patients showed a trend toward a decline in working memory, and had lower cognitive test scores than healthy controls at the one-year assessment.

356,"Tumor resistance to radiotherapy is triggered by an ATM/TAK1-dependent-increased expression of the cellular prion protein. In solid cancers, high expression of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is associated with stemness, invasiveness, and resistance to chemotherapy, but the role of PrPC in tumor response to radiotherapy is unknown. Here, we show that, in neuroblastoma, breast, and colorectal cancer cell lines, PrPC expression is increased after ionizing radiation (IR) and that PrPC deficiency increases radiation sensitivity and decreases radiation-induced radioresistance in tumor cells. In neuroblastoma cells, IR activates ATM that triggers TAK1-dependent phosphorylation of JNK and subsequent activation of the AP-1 transcription factor that ultimately increases PRNP promoter transcriptional activity through an AP-1 binding site in the PRNP promoter. Importantly, we show that this ATM-TAK1-PrPC pathway mediated radioresistance is activated in all tumor cell lines studied and that pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 activity recapitulates the effects of PrPC deficiency.

OBJECTIVE: The present cross-sectional study evaluated the quality of life of patients treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy for cancer of the mouth, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx and investigated possible associations with clinical and sociodemographic variables using multivariate analysis.METHODS: The sample was composed of 90 patients who had completed treatment at least 3 months earlier. Data were collected from April 2016 to May 2017. The patients were clinically evaluated with regard to stimulated salivary flow, trismus, and radiation caries. Sociodemographic data and data related to the disease (stage, location of primary tumor, and radiation dose) were collected from the patient charts. Quality of life was assessed using the Brazilian version of the University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) questionnaire. Poisson logistic regression was performed to determine the mean ratio and test associations with the clinical and sociodemographic variables.RESULTS: The mean total of the UW-QOL was 814.88 (+/- 224.58). Patient age, staging of cancer, hyposalivation, and trismus were associated with quality of life. Patients with tumors in the advanced stage, those with hyposalivation and those with trismus respectively had 11% (CI 0.80-0.98), 12% (CI 0.79-0.99), and 15% (CI 0.77-0.94) lower UW-QOL scores, indicating poorer quality of life.CONCLUSION: Survivors of head and neck cancer experience a negative impact on quality of life associated with trismus, hyposalivation, advanced stage tumors, and a younger patient age. The present findings underscore the importance of a specific approach focused on these aspects to ensure better quality of life in the long term.",Excluded
1057,"Influence of magnetic field on brain activity during administration of caffeine. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the effect of caffeine, the world's most popular psychoactive drug, on the electric activity of the rat's brain that exposed to extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF), during 15 days. The obtained results showed that administration of caffeine in a group of rats by dose of 10 mg/kg (equivalent to human daily consumption) caused a reduction in the mean power amplitude of electroencephalogram (EEG) trace for almost all frequency bands especially alpha (8-12 Hz). It was observed that the influence of caffeine was more evident in motor cortex than in visual cortex. While the exposure of another group to ELF-MF of intensity 0.2 mT during the same period caused an enhancement in the mean power amplitude of most EEG frequency bands; this was more observed in the right hemisphere of the brain than that of the left hemisphere. The administration of caffeine while rats were exposed to ELF-MF, led, after 5 days of exposure, to a great increase in the mean power amplitude of alpha band at all places of recording electrodes. It may be concluded that caffeine administration was more effective in reducing the hazardous of ELF-MF in motor cortex than in visual cortex.",Excluded
313,"X-ray microtomography (microCT) using phase contrast for the investigation of organic matter. PURPOSE: We show that microtomography (microCT) using synchrotron radiation (SR) can be extended to include X-ray phase contrast, which is two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional attenuation contrast and better suited for the investigation of specimens consisting chiefly of light elements for photon energies ranging at least from 1 to 100 keV.METHOD: Phase contrast is generated by placing the specimen in one of the interfering beams of an X-ray interferometer. With use of 12-keV X-rays, phase projections of the specimen are recorded at 180 or 360 angular settings equally spaced between 0 and 180 degrees. One phase projection consists of four pairs of ""associated"" radiograms in the sense that one is taken with and the other without the specimen in the beam. Between pairs a parallel-sided phase-shifter plate is rotated for changing the relative phase of the two interfering beams by multiples of pi/2 rad. By calculating phase-weighted sums of all associated pairs of radiograms, true phase-shift projections are obtained for all angular settings of the specimen, which are then reconstructed.RESULTS: Three-dimensional images have been obtained from rat cerebrum and rat trigeminal nerve, showing cell structures at 8- to 15-micron spatial resolution. Gray and white matter of cerebrum and neurons in the trigeminal nerve are clearly visible.CONCLUSION: X-ray phase-contrast microCT is becoming a valuable tool for studies of organic samples in medicine and biology.",Excluded
483,"Low (20 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle radiation lead to a persistent reduction in the spatial learning ability of rats. Exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is considered to be a potential health risk in long-term space travel, and it represents a significant risk to the central nervous system (CNS). The most harmful component of GCR is the HZE [high-mass, highly charged (Z), high-energy] particles, e.g. <sup>56</sup>Fe. In previous ground-based experiments, exposure to high doses of HZE-particle radiation induced pronounced deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rodents. Recent data suggest that glutamatergic transmission in hippocampal synaptosomes is impaired after low (60 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles, which could lead to impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. To assess the effects of mission-relevant (2060 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles on hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, male Wistar rats either received sham treatment or were irradiated and tested 3 months later in the Barnes maze test. Compared to the controls, rats that received 20, 40 and 60 cGy 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles showed significant impairments in their ability to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze, which was manifested by progressively increasing escape latency times over the 3 days of testing. However, this increase was not due to a lack of motivation of the rats to escape, because the total number of head pokes (and especially incorrect head pokes) remained constant over the test period. Given that rats exposed to X rays did not exhibit spatial memory impairments until >10 Gy was delivered, the RBE for 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle-induced hippocampal spatial memory impairment is ~50. These data demonstrate that mission-relevant doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles can result in severe deficits in hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive tasks, and the extreme sensitivity of these processes to 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles must arise due to the perturbation of multiple processes in addition to killing neuronal cells. © 2012 by Radiation Research Society.

De novo cavernous malformation (CM) formation after radiation therapy for brain tumors is well known, but CM formation adjacent to a radiosurgically treated arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is rare.<sup>1</sup> This video demonstrates the microsurgical resection of a de novo CM adjacent to a previously treated high-grade AVM and clipping of a middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. A 70-yr-old male with history of radiosurgery for AVM presented with aphasia and confusion. Preoperative angiography showed complete occlusion of the AVM. MRI showed multiple cystic lesions suspicious for radiation-induced necrosis and CM. IRB approval and patient consent was obtained. A pterional craniotomy was performed with transsylvian exposure of the insula. The radiated feeding arteries were followed to the occluded AVM nidus. A CM was noted deep to this candelabra of the MCA vessels, which were mobilized to access and resect the CM. A small incision was made in this insular cortex underneath the malformation circumferentially freeing it of adhesions. The sclerotic AVM nidus was circumferentially dissected and removed en bloc. Thorough exploration of the resection cavity revealed no residual CM or AVM nidus. Attention was then turned to the M2-MCA bifurcation aneurysm, which was occluded with a straight clip. Postoperative imaging confirmed complete CM resection. The patient recovered from his aphasia. This case demonstrates the management of a radiation-induced de novo CM following treatment of a high-grade AVM. Radiographic follow-up for radiosurgically treated AVM is needed to rule out long-term complications. Bleeding from a de novo CM mimics bleeding from residual AVM nidus, requiring careful angiographic evaluation. Copyright © 2019 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded

334,"Infrared nonlinear optical measurements of membrane potential in photoreceptor cells. In the past it has not been possible to measure optically the membrane potential of cells and collections of cells that are either naturally photosensitive or that can be activated by photolyzable caged transmitter molecules. This paper reports on a unique application of nonlinear optics that can monitor the potential of cellular membranes with a near-infrared source. Among many other singular advantages, this nonlinear optical approach to measuring membrane potential does not activate light sensitive cells or cell suspensions and cellular networks surrounded with photolyzable molecules. To demonstrate this capability we show that the technique can be applied to living photoreceptor cells that are very sensitive to visible light. These cells are ideal for characterizing such a new technique, not only because of their unmatched sensitivity to light, but also because their electrical responses have been extensively characterized (Minks and Selinger, 1992).",Excluded

Ionizing radiation leads to release of free radicals into the systemic circulation from irradiated tissues. These free radicals cause oxidative stress in distant organs. Oxidative status may be reversed by naturally occurring antioxidant agents. The aim of this study was to investigate protective and antioxidant effects of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) and thymoquinone (TQ) in kidney tissue of rats exposed to cranial irradiation. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: IR group received irradiation (IR) to total cranium plus saline; IR plus NSO group received IR and NSO; IR plus TQ group received IR and TQ; sham group did not receive NSO, TQ or IR; control group of TQ received dimethyl sulfoxide; control group of NSO received saline. Total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) levels were studied as oxidative parameters, and total antioxidant status (TAS), total sulfhydryl levels, paraoxonase (PON), ceruloplasmin (Cp) and arylesterase activities were determined as antioxidative parameters in the kidney tissue of rats. Kidney TOS, OSI and LOOH levels were significantly lower in IR plus TQ, IR plus NSO and sham groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001). TAS, PON and Cp activities in IR group were significantly lower compared to the control group (p < 0.001). PON and Cp activities were significantly higher in IR plus NSO and IR plus TQ groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001).

424,"A common sense approach to radiotherapy planning of glioblastoma multiforme situated in the temporal lobe. PURPOSE: Irradiation remains the cornerstone of management for glioblastoma multiforme. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer advocate encompassing the primary tumor plus a 2-cm margin in the high-dose volume. One shortcoming of this approach is the exposure of critical structures to radiation doses that could exceed organ tolerance. We investigated whether the temporal bone (rather than the aforementioned 2-cm radius) would serve as a barrier to tumor spread when regarded as the anterior margin for temporal lobe lesions. We hypothesized that by using the temporal bone as the radiation field margin, toxicity could be reduced without compromising tumor control.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2003 and 2007, 342 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme were treated with surgery and primary irradiation at our institution. Of these 342 patients, 50 had lesions confined to the temporal lobe. The clinical target volume included the primary lesion, the area of edema when present, and a 2-cm margin, except in the direction of the temporal bone.RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 40 were available for evaluation. At a median follow-up of 12.95 months, 8 patients had not yet shown signs of tumor progression, 24 had local failure, 7 had distant or mixed (local plus distant) failure, and only 1 patient had failure in the infratemporal fossa.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study have demonstrated an acceptable level of recurrence when the temporal bone, rather than a 2-cm margin, is used as the anterior border of the clinical target volume. The strategy we have proposed achieves tumor control and respects optic tolerance without resorting to complex, expensive approaches such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy.",Excluded

Evidence by functional imaging studies suggests the role of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the inhibitory control of nociceptive transmission system. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is able to modulate pain response to capsaicin. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of DLPFC activation (through rTMS) on nociceptive control in a model of capsaicin-induced pain. The study was performed on healthy subjects that underwent capsaicin application on right or left hand. Subjects judged the pain induced by capsaicin through a 0-100 VAS scale before and after 5 Hz rTMS over left and right DLPFC at 10 or 20 min after capsaicin application in two separate groups (8 subjects each). Left DLPFC-rTMS delivered either at 10 and 20 min after capsaicin application significantly decreased spontaneous pain in both hands. Right DLPFC rTMS showed no significant effect on pain measures. According to these results, stimulation of left DLPFC seems able to exert a bilateral control on pain system, supporting the critical antinociceptive role of such area.

342,"Planning of radiotherapy with PET: Volumes only?. Aim: We assess the percentage of cases in which findings of distant disease through 18F-FDG PET/CT for radiotherapy planning lead to changes in the modality and/or intent of the treatment, or change in stage IV. Material(s) and Method(s): All the studies derived from the Radiotherapy department were retrospectively analysed. Those performed for radiotherapy planning were selected. Cases with distant disease findings were assessed, investigating changes in the modality or intent of treatment and change in stage IV. One thousand four hundred seventy six studies were derived from the Radiotherapy department between April/09 and December/13. Three hundred and seventy three (25,3%) were performed for radiotherapy planning (267 males and 106 females, mean age 68.2 years). The intention of radiotherapy was for radical treatment planning. Result(s): In 45 of these studies (12%) there were previously not suspected findings that suggested an upstage of the patients to a clinical stage IV. The unexpected disease was located more frequently in bone (12 patients), followed by lung (9 patients), liver (10), distant adenopathy (6 patients), brain (4 patients), adrenal glands (4 patients), spleen (1 patient) and multiple progression (1 patient).In twenty-six (26/45, 7%) of these patients the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT were confirmed as true positive for distant metastasis with complementary examinations. In sixteen (16/26) of them the modality of treatment was changed. In ten of them (10/26) the intent of treatment was changed from curative to palliative. In three patients a second primary tumour was confirmed.In remaining sixteen (16/45) patients the results of 18F-FDG PET/CT could not be initially confirmed. The confirmation was made by monitoring progression in eleven patients, one patient remained with stable disease and four patients died without being able to confirm the findings. Conclusion(s): 18F-FDG PET/CT studies in radiotherapy planning improve the staging of patients, leading to an upstage in a significant number of patients. Based upon the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT, the modality or the intent of treatment may radically change, (making unnecessary radiation) or changing the intent to palliative.",Excluded

Method(s):Review of an advances in the broad field of biochirality connecting two poles of the phenomena: the atomic orbitals and the brain's cognitive function. Result(s): The chain of chirality transfer in the living organism hierarchical structure consisting of several distinct levels. The set of these levels includes the chirality transfer of following types: From the elementary particle to atomic orbital level. From the atomic orbital to the molecular level. From the molecular to supramolecular and macro-molecular levels. From the molecular to the cellular level. From the cellular to morphological level. From the morphological level to the functional level. Conclusion(s): The striking similarity in the chirality-related effects within a broad class of molecular, cellular, and morphological structures inspired researchers in many fields of stereochemistry and neuroscience. This advance in the current results suggests the fundamental significance of molecular chirality in biological transport, neuro-development, sensory perception, motor behavior, brain cognitive functions, human psychology, and psychiatry. The helical structures of the proteins are known to be the consequence of amino acid chirality. The helicity of proteins, in turn, provides an opportunity for chiral biological macromolecular systems with higher hierarchical levels of symmetry and yet unknown functions. The hierarchy of chirality transfer, evident particularly from the current review, possesses several not trivial features. Each of the consequently-following hierarchical levels is contributed to from the complex power of all lower levels. Each level has its own quasi-independent internal and external determinants. The majority of the external determinants exhibit a chiral nature. As such, the chirality of external determinants is a critical factor in the evolution and development of the organism. The fundamental nature of chirality transfer should be considered in experimental design strategy in neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and pharmacology. Molecular chirality is a promising landmark in the search of reliable biomarkers in the spectrum of the disease conditions including neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.",Excluded
529,"Depression of involuntary activity in muscles paralyzed by spinal cord injury. Involuntary muscle contractions are common after spinal cord injury (SCI). Increased sensitivity to Ia muscle afferent input may contribute to the development of these spasms. Since tendon vibration results in a period of postactivation depression of the Ia synapse, we sought to determine whether Achilles tendon vibration (80 HZ for 2 s) altered involuntary contractions evoked by superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) stimulation (5 pulses at 300 HZ) in paralyzed leg muscles of subjects with chronic (>1 year) SCI. Responses to SPN stimulation that were conditioned by vibration were reduced in 66% of trials (by 33+/-12% in tibialis anterior and 40+/-16% in soleus). These reductions in electromyographic activity are unlikely to be mediated by changes at the Ia synapse or motoneuron because vibration did not alter the magnitude of the soleus H reflex. The electromyographic reductions may involve long-lasting neuromodulatory effects on spinal inhibitory interneurons or synapses involved in the flexor reflex pathway. Vibration-evoked depression of electromyographic activity may be clinically useful in controlling involuntary muscle contractions after SCI.",Excluded

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on the workers' circulatory system, and to find out to what extent the EMF frequency, short-term (maximum values) and chronic (daily and lifetime doses) exposures influence the type of the observed disorders. The gathered data will help to evaluate whether hygiene standards that limit maximum admissible EMF values (e.g., ICNIRP standards) protect against adverse effects of exposure. The study covered workers employed in transformer and distribution stations, medium wave transmitting stations, radio-service and radio and TV multichannel broadcasting stations. In all the cases, exposure levels were considerably lower than those set as admissible according to the ICNIRP standards. Nevertheless changes in the circulatory system and a significant relationship between blood pressure and neurovegetative regulation disorders and exposure parameters were observed. The frequency of changes in the circulatory system was significantly dependent not only on the maximum EMF value, but also on its dose, which indicates that the hygiene standards for EMF cannot be limited only to short-term exposure maximum values, but they should be supplemented with dose-related standards.",Excluded

224,"Shortness of breath: An unusual presentation of an uncommon malignancy. Small cell carcinomas (SCC) are rare neuroendocrine malignancies accounting for approximately 0.2% of all colorectal cancers. Since first described in 1955, approximately 200 cases of rectal SCC have been reported in the literature. The most widely accepted theory regarding development of SCC is divergent differentiation of a pluripotent stem cell precursor. Interestingly, although the gastrointestinal tract (GI) has the largest number of neuroendocrine cells, it is rare for neuroendocrine malignancies to originate there. We present a case of metastatic SCC presenting with chief complaint of dyspnea. A 50 year old female with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department with a 2 day history of dyspnea on exertion. She reported two weeks of abdominal bloating, rectal tenesmus, constipation, and unintentional weight loss. Vital signs were notable for hypertension and tachycardia.

CT PE protocol demonstrated 2 subcentimeter lung nodules in the right middle lobe. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed a mid-rectal mass extending 10cm superiorly. Biopsies revealed small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with squamous differentiation. Chemotherapy was initiated with carboplatin and etoposide. Small cell carcinomas of the GI tract are exceedingly uncommon. It most commonly presents in the 6th decade of life with male predominance. These tumors exhibit highly aggressive behavior and carry a poor prognosis with a median survival of 10.4 months. Immunohistochemistry differentiates SCC from other malignancies, with strongly positive synaptophysin immunoreactivity the most reliable finding.

459,"Phase 1/2 trials of Temozolomide, Motexafin Gadolinium, and 60-Gy fractionated radiation for newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme: final results of RTOG 0513. PURPOSE: The purpose of phase 1 was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of motexafin gadolinium (MGd) given concurrently with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT) in patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Phase 2 determined whether this combination improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in GBM recursive partitioning analysis class III to V patients compared to therapies for recently published historical controls.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose escalation in phase 1 progressed through 3 cohorts until 2 of 6 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity or a dose of 5 mg/kg was reached. Once MTD was established, a 1-sided 1-sample log-rank test at significance level of .1 had 85% power to detect a median survival difference (13.69 vs 18.48 months) with 60 deaths over a 12-month accrual period and an additional 18 months of follow-up. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: In phase 1, 24 patients were enrolled. The MTD established was 5 mg/kg, given intravenously 5 days a week for the first 10 RT fractions, then 3 times a week for the duration of RT. The 7 patients enrolled in the third dose level and the 94 enrolled in phase 2 received this dose. Of these 101 patients, 87 were eligible and evaluable. Median survival time was 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.9-17.6 months), not significantly different from that of the historical control (P=.36). Median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.7-9.6 months). One patient (1%) experienced a grade 5 adverse event possibly related to therapy during the concurrent phase, and none experience toxicity during adjuvant TMZ therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment was well tolerated, but median OS did not reach improvement specified by protocol compared to historical control, indicating that the combination of standard RT with TMZ and MGd did not achieve a significant survival advantage.",Excluded
778,"Clinical controversies: proton radiation therapy for brain and skull base tumors. Proton radiotherapy offers distinct physical properties that could lead to an improvement of dose distribution with subsequent reduction of integral dose to the patient. This supports the potential use of proton beams in tumors close to sensitive structures, such as the skull base and the brain. In the present manuscript, the literature on proton therapy for brain and skull base tumors is critically reviewed and compared with results obtained with modern photon techniques. Treatment planning comparisons demonstrate that dose distributions within the target are comparable. In terms of normal tissue dose distribution, protons offer an advantage in the intermediate- and low-dose regions, and this may result in long-term clinical benefit, although to date no randomized or long-term follow-up data demonstrate this. Considering the excellent long-term results seen with photons in localized tumors, this benefit may be modest and difficult to demonstrate. Protons may allow for safe delivery of higher local doses with the potential to improve local control in some tumors. However, improvements in photon techniques also enable safe dose escalation, and therefore, the comparison of the techniques of delivery is likely to need randomized trials. Proton therapy offers effective treatment for a range of brain tumors. However, the limited availability, the cost, and the lack of evidence of superiority mean that advanced photon radiotherapy continues to be the treatment of choice. It is hoped that advances in technology, both in proton and photon radiotherapy delivery, and increasing information on the efficacy and toxicity of the two modalities will lead to further improvement in radiotherapy approaches and provide the basis for the best choice of treatment for the individual patient.",Excluded
1094,"Platelet aggregation in acute coronary syndromes: use of a new aggregometer with laser light scattering to assess platelet aggregability. OBJECTIVE: Platelet aggregation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes. Small aggregates consisting of < or = 100 platelets cannot be quantified with a conventional aggregometer employing optical density. Using a recently developed aggregometer based on laser light scattering, we studied platelet aggregability in patients with acute coronary syndromes.METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 39 patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina who had received no prior antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, to be assayed immediately using a PA-100 platelet aggregometer. Blood samples from 14 healthy volunteers were used as controls.RESULTS: Spontaneous formation of platelet aggregates was observed only in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The size of these aggregates was small, consisting of < or = 100 platelets (primary aggregation). Agonist-induced aggregation consisted of two phases. In the first few minutes, the number of small aggregates increased markedly (primary aggregation), followed by an increase in larger aggregates (secondary aggregation). The EC50 of epinephrine for primary aggregation was nearly 50 times lower in acute coronary patients than in controls (P < 0.001), while the EC50 for secondary aggregation was only 2 times lower (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Aggregometry using light scattering suggests that platelet hyperaggregability and hypersensitivity in acute coronary syndromes may occur in primary but not secondary aggregation.",Excluded

Mice were treated daily with [3H]MPTP (30 mg/kg, 1 uCi, s.c.) for 1, 3, and 10 days to determine the fate and localization of tritiated compounds. An untreated mouse was housed either in the same cage (""cage-mate control"") or in an adjacent cage separated by mesh-wire (""near-neighbor control""). The radioactivity measured in blood, brain, liver, and remaining body of [3H]MPTP-treated mice was dependent on the total dose of the drug the animals received and did not vary with the type of tissue analyzed. Significant amounts of radioactivity were found in the tissues of the ""cage-mate control"" mice, but not of the ""near-neighbor control"" mice. The route of transmission appears to be through the urine, as the urine of [3H]MPTP-treated mice was highly radioactive after the drug injection. Only traces of radioactivity were found in their feces and there was no increase in the background radiation in the environment of the cages, indicating that the tritiated compounds were not exhaled. Proper disposal of urinary products of MPTP-treated animals is therefore necessary to reduce the risk of possible drug contamination in humans.",Excluded
855,"The discovery and development of new potential antioxidant agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Introduction: Several neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) including Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases have had associations with the oxidative process and free radical damage. Consequently, in past decades, several natural and synthetic antioxidants have been assessed as therapeutic agents but have shown limitations in bioavailability, metabolic susceptibility and permeability to the blood brain barrier. Given these issues, medicinal chemists are hard at work to modify/improve the chemical structures of these antioxidants, thereby improving their efficacy. Areas covered: In this review, the authors critically analyze several biological mechanisms involved in the generation of free radicals. Additionally, they analyze free radicals' role in the generation of oxidative stress and in the progression of many NDs. Further, the authors review a collection of natural and synthetic antioxidants, their role as free radical scavengers along with their mechanisms of action and their potential for preventing neurodegenerative diseases. Expert opinion: So far, preclinical studies on several antioxidants have shown promise for treating NDs, despite their limitations. The authors do highlight the lack of the adequate animal models for preclinical assessment and this does hinder further progression into clinical trials. Further studies are necessary to fully investigate the potential of these antioxidants as ND therapeutic options. © Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded

The aim is to create a new and safe experimental model of radiation-induced neurovascular histological changes with reduced morbidity and mortality for use with experimental microsurgical techniques. Seventy-two Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were divided as follows: Group I: control group, 24 rats clinically evaluated during six weeks; Group II: evaluation of acute side-effects (two-week follow-up period), 24 irradiated (20 Gy) rats; and Group III: evaluation of subacute side-effects (six-week follow-up period), 24 irradiated (20 Gy) rats. Variables included clinical assessments, weight, vascular permeability (arterial and venous), mortality and histological studies. No significant differences were observed between groups with respect to the variables studied. Significant differences were observed between groups I vs II-III regarding survival rates and histological changes to arteries, veins and nerves. Rat body weights showed progressive increases in all groups, and the mortality rate of the present model is 10.4% compared with 30-40% in the previous models. In conclusion, the designed model induces selective changes by radiotherapy in the neurovascular bundle without histological changes affecting the surrounding tissues. This model allows therapeutic experimental studies to be conducted, including the viability of microvascular and microneural sutures post radiotherapy in the cervical neurovascular bundle.",Included
1060,"Pre-operative versus post-operative radiosurgery of brain metastases-Volumetric and dosimetric impact of treatment sequence and margin concept. Background: Pre-operative radiosurgery (SRS) preceding the resection of brain metastases promises to circumvent limitations of post-operative cavity SRS. It minimizes uncertainties regarding delineation and safety margins and could reduce dose exposure of the healthy brain (HB). Method(s): We performed a systematic treatment plan comparison on 24 patients who received post-operative radiosurgery of the resection cavity at our institution. Comparative treatment plans were calculated for hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (7 x 5 Gray (Gy)) in a hypothetical pre-operative (pre-op) and two post-operative scenarios, either with (extended field, post-op-E) or without the surgical tract (involved field, post-op-I). Detailed volumetric comparison of the resulting target volumes was performed, as well as dosimetric comparison focusing on targets and the HB. Result(s): The resection cavity was significantly smaller and different in morphology from the pre-operative lesion, yielding a low Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 53% (p = 0.019). Post-op-I and post-op-E targets showed high similarity (DSC = 93%), and including the surgical tract moderately enlarged resulting median target size (18.58 ccm vs. 22.89 ccm, p < 0.001). Dosimetric analysis favored the pre-operative treatment setting since it significantly decreased relevant dose exposure of the HB (Median volume receiving 28 Gy: 6.79 vs. 10.79 for pre-op vs. post-op-E, p < 0.001). Dosimetrically, pre-operative SRS is a promising alternative to post-operative cavity irradiation that could furthermore offer practical benefits regarding delineation and treatment planning. Comparative trials are required to evaluate potential clinical advantages of this approach. Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

Understanding the effects of radiation and its possible influence on the nervous system are of great clinical interest.However, there have been few electrophysiological studies on brain activity after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR).A new methodological approach regarding the assessment of the possible effects of IR on brain activity is the use of linear and nonlinear mathematical methods in the analysis of complex time series, such as brain oscillations measured using the electrocorticogram (ECoG).The objective of this study was to use linear and nonlinear mathematical methods as biomarkers of gamma radiation regarding cortical electrical activity.Adult Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: 1 control and 2 irradiated groups, evaluated at 24 h (IR24) and 90 days (IR90) after exposure to 18 Gy of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 radiotherapy source.The ECoG was analyzed using power spectrum methods for the calculation of the power of delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms and by means of the alpha-exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).Using both mathematical methods it was possible to identify changes in the ECoG, and to identify significant changes in the pattern of the recording at 24 h after irradiation.Some of these changes were persistent at 90 days after exposure to IR.In particular, the theta wave using the two methods showed higher sensitivity than other waves, suggesting that it is a possible biomarker of exposure to IR.

800,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the treatment of Nelson's syndrome: a multicenter, international study. OBJECTIVE: Nelson's syndrome is a rare and challenging neuroendocrine disorder, and it is associated with elevated adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) level, skin hyperpigmentation, and pituitary adenoma growth. Management options including resection and medical therapy are traditional approaches. Ionizing radiation in the form of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is also being utilized to treat Nelson's syndrome. In the current study the authors sought to better define the therapeutic role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in Nelson's syndrome.METHODS: Study patients with Nelson's syndrome were treated with single-fraction GKRS (median margin dose of 25 Gy) at 6 different centers as part of an International Radiosurgery Research Foundation (IRRF) investigation. Data including neurological function, endocrine response, and radiological tumor response were collected and sent to the study-coordinating center for review. Fifty-one patients with median endocrine and radiological follow-ups of 91 and 80.5 months from GKRS, respectively, were analyzed for endocrine remission, tumor control, and neurological outcome. Statistical methods were used to identify prognostic factors for these endpoints.RESULTS: At last follow-up, radiological tumor control was achieved in 92.15% of patients. Endocrine remission off medical management and reduction in pre-SRS ACTH level were achieved in 29.4% and 62.7% of patients, respectively. Improved remission rates were associated with a shorter time interval between resection and GKRS (p = 0.039). Hypopituitarism was seen in 21.6% and new visual deficits were demonstrated in 15.7% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: GKRS affords a high rate of pituitary adenoma control and improvement in ACTH level for the majority of Nelson's syndrome patients. Hypopituitarism is the most common adverse effect from GKRS in Nelson's syndrome patients and warrants longitudinal follow-up for detection and endocrine replacement.",Excluded

Method(s): Thirteen consecutive patients with brain metastases from UCC were managed with a Leksell gamma-knife at our institution between January 2003 and December 2010. Clinical features and radiosurgical outcomes of patients were analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): Gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS) was chosen as the only treatment in four patients and performed in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in nine patients. GKRS was conducted simultaneously with WBRT within a 1-month interval in six patients and was chosen as the salvage treatment after WBRT in three patients. The mean number of metastatic brain lesions per patient was 5.7 (range, 1-16). The median cumulative tumor volume was 23.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 2.7-40.2 cm<sup>3</sup>), and the median marginal dose covering the tumors was 14 Gy of a 50 % isodose line (range, 8-25 Gy). Nine patients showed relief of main neurologic symptoms after GKRS. The median length of time that the patients spent in an improved neurologic state was 11.1 weeks (range, 2-39.6 weeks).

Glioblastoma is associated with poor prognosis with a median survival of one year. High doses of ionizing radiation is the only established exogenous risk factor. To explore new potential biological risk factors for glioblastoma, we investigated alterations in metabolite concentrations in pre-diagnosed serum samples from glioblastoma patients diagnosed up to 22 years after sample collection, and undiseased controls. The study points out a latent biomarker for future glioblastoma consisting of nine metabolites (gamma-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol, erythritol, erythronic acid, myo-inositol, cystine, 2-keto-L-gluconic acid, hypoxanthine and xanthine) involved in antioxidant metabolism.

In recent years, many efforts have focused on combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as adjuvants to curative surgery in patients with stage II and III (UICC) rectal carcinomas. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) makes it possible to increase the total irradiation dose in a locally restricted area while sparing normal mobile organs, but it is limited by increased late toxicity. A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%).

Patients initially sought medical treatment due to headache; other symptoms were hearing loss, visual deterioration, seizure, hemiparesis, vertigo, memory loss and agnosia. A temporal approach through a linear incision was performed for all cases. RTLN was found in one side in 7 patients, and bilaterally in 5. 4 patients underwent resection of necrotic tissue bilaterally and 8 patients on one side.RESULTS: No death occurred in this series of cases. There were no post-operative complications, except 1 patient who developed aseptic meningitis. All 12 patients were free from headache. No seizure occurred in patients with preoperative epilepsy. Other symptoms such as hemiparesis and vertigo improved in all patients. Memory loss, agnosia and hearing loss did not change post-operatively in all cases. The follow-up MR images demonstrated no recurrence of necrotic lesions in all 12 patients.CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical intervention through a temporal approach with linear incision is warranted in patients with radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis with significant symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure, minimum space occupying effect on imaging, or neurological deterioration despite conservative management.",Excluded
939,"Muscles in microgravity: from fibres to human motion. In simulated or actual microgravity, human and animal postural muscles undergo substantial atrophy: after about 270 days, the muscle mass attains a constant value of about 70% of the initial one. Most animal studies reported preferential atrophy of slow twitch fibres whose mechanical properties change towards the fast type. However, in humans, at the end of a 42-days bed rest study, a similar atrophy of slow and fast fibres was observed. After microgravity, the maximal force of several muscle groups showed a substantial decrease (6-25% of pre-flight values). The maximal power during very short ""explosive"" efforts of 0.25-0.30s showed an even greater fall, being reduced to 65% after 1 month and to 45% (of pre-flight values) after 6 months. The maximal power developed during 6-7s ""all-out"" bouts on an isokinetic cycloergometer was reduced to a lesser extent, attaining about 75% of pre-flight values, regardless of the flight duration. In these same subjects, the muscle mass of the lower limbs declined by only 9-13%. Thus, a substantial fraction of the observed decreases of maximal power is probably due to a deterioration of the motor co-ordination brought about by the absence of gravity. To prevent this substantial decay of maximal absolute power, we propose that explosive exercise be added to the daily in-flight training schedule. We also describe a system aimed at reducing cardiovascular deconditioning wherein gravity is simulated by the centrifugal acceleration generated by the motion of two counter rotating bicycles ridden by the astronauts on the inner wall of a cylindrical space module. Finally, cycling on circular or elliptical tracks may be useful to reduce cardiovascular deconditioning in permanently manned lunar bases. Indeed, on the curved parts of the path, a cyclist generates an outward acceleration vector (ac). To counterbalance ac, the cyclist must lean inwards, so that the vectorial sum of ac plus the lunar gravity tends to the acceleration of gravity prevailing on Earth.",Excluded

In normal mice, interactions with granule cells promote Purkinje cell dendritic differentiation. Partial destruction of the granule cell population in young +/Lc mice by x irradiation resulted in a significant increase in Purkinje cell dendritic growth and improved cytoplasmic structure but did not prevent Purkinje cell death. These results indicate two components to Purkinje cell abnormalities in +/Lc mice: a retardation/blockade of dendritic development that is mediated by interactions with granule cells and the death of the cell. Thus, the normal trophic effects of granule cell interaction on Purkinje cell development are absent in the +/Lc cerebellum, suggesting that granule cells are powerful regulators of Purkinje cell differentiation.",Excluded

In this study, we exploit the high temporal and spatial resolution of optical imaging to characterize perfusion-dependent and -independent changes in response to CSD and to investigate the etiology of reflectance changes during CSD. In this experiment, we characterized the optical response to CSD at wavelengths that emphasize perfusion-related changes (610 and 550 nm), and we compared these results with 850 nm and blood volume data. Blood volume changes during CSD were recorded using an intravascular fluorescent dye, Texas Red dextran. We observed triphasic optical signals at 850 and 550 nm characterized by spreading waves of increased, decreased, then increased reflectance (Fig. 1) which expanded at a rate of approximately 3-5 mm/min. The signal at 610 nm had a similar initial phase, but the phase 2 response was slightly more complex, with a parenchymal decrease in reflectance but a vascular increase in reflectance. Reflectance values decreased in phase three. Blood volume signals were delayed relative to the optical intrinsic signals and corresponded temporally to phases 2 and 3. This is the first study to characterize optical imaging of intrinsic signal responses to CSD, in vivo, at multiple wavelengths. The data presented here suggest that changes in light scattering precede perfusion responses, the blood volume increase (phase 2) is accompanied by a reduction in deoxyhemoglobin, and the blood volume decrease (phase 3) is accompanied by an increase in deoxyhemoglobin.

Median tumor diameter was 20 mm (range 10-60) and 11 mm (5-22), median GTV was 5.87 cc (0.88-27.90) and 3.34 cc (0.33-9.07), median PTV was 28.48 cc (2.7-133.8) and 14.785 cc (7.3-113.3) for primary and secondary lung cancer, respectively. Response was evaluated with CT and/or FDG-PET imaging 3-4 months after the end of SBRT and every 4-6 months thereafter. Toxicity was evaluated according to CTCAE v3.0. We retrospectively analyzed clinical, treatment-related and dosimetric factors. Factors including total radiation dose, site of lesion, diameter, GTV, PTV, V5, V10, V20, V30 and mean lung dose (MLD) of ipsilateral lung were considered in order to evaluate the development of RP using the Cox proportional hazards model. The predictive accuracy for RP was assessed by using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis to define the cut-off points for significant parameters. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 20.5 months (range 4 - 91) and 18 months (14-80) for primary and secondary lung cancer. RP G1-2 has been observed in 23/54 patients (42.59%); no pulmonary toxicity >G2 has occurred, as there has been no toxicity of controlateral lung and other organs at risk. Univariate statistical analysis showed that GTV(p=0.036), PTV (p=0.022), MLD (p=0.003) and V5 (p=0.002), V10 (p=0.002), V20 (p=0.012), V30 (p=0.002) were significant variables for the risk of developing RP. Multivariate statistical analysis has found that the predictor variables of RP are V5 (p=0.004), V10 (p=0.009), V20 (p=0.014), V30 (p=0.007) and the MLD (p=0.011). The greatest risk was connected to the variable V30 (HR 1.985 ). On the ROC curve, the cut-off values of ipsilateral lung V5,V10,V20,V30 and MLD were 29.50%,19.50%,9.55%,4.58% and 4.7%, respectively (Fig.1). A cutoff of 4.58% for V30 had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 82.1%.

20,"Demographics and outcome of meningioma patients treated in a tertiary care center in the middle east. INTRODUCTION: Meningioma is the most frequently diagnosed intracranial primary brain tumor. Many risk and prognostic factors have been previously reported from various centers in different parts of the world. To our knowledge, data from the Middle East region is lacking. We set to study the risk factors and outcomes of meningioma patients treated in a multidisciplinary tertiary-care center in the Middle East treating patients from the entire region. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with pathologic diagnosis of meningioma from January 2005 to December 2015 at the American Univeristy of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) were included. Baseline demographics and risk factors were retrospectively collected and reviewed. Follow up and current disease status were then collected from the patients' charts and updated by a specific questionnaire phone call interviews done by a third party. RESULT(S): Two-hundred and seven patients were analyzed. The mean overall survival (OS) and Progression free survival (PFS) for the entire cohort was 81 and 30 months respectively. Patients' area of residence (city VS country side), occupation, alcohol use, oral contraceptive use, family history of meningioma, previous head trauma, exposure to radiation head/brain imaging, cell phone use, and finally their current meningioma's Ki-67 stain were examined in univariate analysis and found not to correlate with survival outcome. On the other hand, high BMI (>25), male gender, intermediate/high grade and subtotal resection were significant predictors of worse OS. Multivariate analysis showed that subtotal resection and intermediate/high grade tumors were significant independent predictors of poor survival. CONCLUSION(S): In conclusion, our findings coincide with other results reported in the literature from other regions. Complete surgical resection and low-grade disease remain the two most important prognostic factors for patients diagnosed with meningioma.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a devastating late complication of radiotherapy. However, research on the imaging performance of RION is not sufficient. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) early after injury of the optic nerve of rhesus monkeys by a single-dose/fractionation-scheme of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intraorbital optic nerve contour of 5 rhesus monkeys was acquired by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Then, the unilateral intraorbital optic nerves of 5 rhesus monkeys were injured by gamma knife surgery (GKS) with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve). DTI was performed before the irradiation and 1week, 2weeks, 4weeks, and 24weeks after injury to obtain the cross-sectional area, and the fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) values.RESULTS: The cross-sectional area of the injured optic nerve exhibited significant atrophy 24weeks after SRS. FA declined 1week after injury; this value then increased slightly but remained lower than before injury (P<0.05). AD began to decline in the 2weeks after injury and gradually disappeared (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: SRS with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve) on the unilateral intraorbital optic nerve can induce RION. DTI can detect RION at an early stage. FA and AD are useful indicators for RION diagnosis. In the early stage, the primary site of RION may be the vascular endothelium.",Included
353,"Radiotherapy for oligometastatic lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) typically presents at an advanced stage, which is often felt to be incurable, and such patients are usually treated with a palliative approach. Accumulating retrospective and prospective clinical evidence, including a recently completed randomized trial, support the existence of an oligometastatic disease state wherein select individuals with advanced NSCLC may experience historically unprecedented prolonged survival with aggressive local treatments, consisting of radiotherapy and/or surgery, to limited sites of metastatic disease. This is reflected in the most recent AJCC staging subcategorizing metastatic disease into intra-thoracic (M1a), a single extra thoracic site (M1b), and more diffuse metastases (M1c). In the field of radiation oncology, recent technological advances have allowed for the delivery of very high, potentially ablative, doses of radiotherapy to both intra- and extra-cranial disease sites, referred to as stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy (or SABR), in much shorter time periods compared to conventional radiation and with minimal associated toxicity. At the same time, significant improvements in systemic therapy, including platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, molecular agents targeting oncogene-addicted NSCLC, and immunotherapy in the form of checkpoint inhibitors, have led to improved control of micro-metastatic disease and extended survival sparking newfound interest in combining these agents with ablative local therapies to provide additive, and in the case of radiation and immunotherapy, potentially synergistic, effects in order to further improve progression-free and overall survival. Currently, despite the tantalizing potential associated with aggressive local therapy in the setting of oligometastatic NSCLC, well-designed prospective randomized controlled trials sufficiently powered to detect and measure the possible added benefit afforded by this approach are desperately needed.

820,"Breast cancer brain metastases: Molecular subtype, treatment and survival. BACKGROUND: No clear guidelines exist for management of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM). OBJECTIVE(S): We assessed the relationship between patient and tumor characteristics, treatment, and overall survival (OS). METHOD(S):We conducted a retrospective review of 196 patients who received brain radiation for BCBMbetween 2009-2013 at Mayo Clinic. Primary tumor characteristics were collected, including simplified molecular subtype. Other characteristics included patient's ECOG, number of brain lesions at BCBM diagnosis, and treatment received, including neurosurgery, whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The primary endpoint was OS from time of BCBM diagnosis. RESULT(S): Single-variable analysis revealed patients with HER2+ breast cancer had improved OS (HR = 0:6, p = 0:008). Compared to patients with 1-3 brain lesions, the risk of death in patients with leptomeningeal disease was 2.5-fold higher (p = 0:003). Worsening ECOG status was associated with worsening OS. Patients who received SRS and WBRT had improved OS (HR = 0:37, p < 0:001) compared to patients receiving WBRT alone. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with the best OS had an ECOG of 0, HER2<sup>+</sup> disease, and 1-3 brain lesions. The best OS was associated with the combination of neurosurgery and radiation therapy.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. The present study was undertaken to investigate the pretreatment effects of standardized Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) and low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation on the neurological dysfunction in the reserpine model of PD. Male Wistar rats were pretreated orally with EGb761 or fractionated low-dose whole-body gamma-irradiation or their combination, then subjected to intraperitoneal injection of reserpine (5 mg/kg body weight) 24 h after the final dose of EGb761 or radiation. Reserpine injection resulted in the depletion of striatal dopamine (DA) level, increased catalepsy score, increased oxidative stress indicated via depletion of glutathione (GSH), increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and iron levels, decreased DA metabolites metabolizing enzymes; indicated by inhibition by glutathione-S-transferase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO) activities, mitochondrial dysfunction; indicated by declined complex I activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level and increased apoptosis; indicated by decreased mitochondrial B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein level and by transmission electron microscope. EGb761 and low-dose gamma-radiation ameliorated the reserpine-induced state of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in brain. It can be concluded that EGb761, a widely used herbal medicine and low dose of gamma-irradiation have protective effects for combating Parkinsonism possibly via replenishment of GSH levels.

Purpose: Portal vein embolization is an accepted technique for hypertrophy of the left lobe in patients with small future liver remnant ratio (FLR). Vouche et al. showed a comparable effect following right lobe radiation lobectomy with glass microspheres. Unlike PVE, radiation lobectomy has the potential advantage of simultaneous tumor control. Right lobe selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres, Sydney, Australia) is hypothesized to induce similar volumetric changes in the liver at 3 and 6 months (m), while also providing directed therapy to the right liver. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients (mean age 62 y, 8M, 7F) with unilobar disease were treated with right lobar SIRT utilizing resin microspheres (mean dose 34.1 mCi, range 11-80) between September 2009 and December 2013. Neoplasm types included hepatocellular (n=5), cholangiocarcinoma (n=4), metastatic colon (n=2), gallbladder (n=1), appendiceal (n=1), thyroid (n=1) and neuroendocrine (n=1). Total liver volumes, lobar volumes, FLR, and % of FLR hypertrophy from baseline (%FLR) were assessed prior to and after right lobar SIRT at 3m and 6m follow-up utilizing CT or MRI. Result(s): Follow-up imaging was available for 13/15 patients at 3m and 11/15 patients at 6m. Left lobe hypertrophy was seen at 3m (p=0.002) and 6m (p=0.003). Right lobe atrophy was also seen at 3m (p=0.02) and 6m (p=0.04). FLR hypertrophy was seen at both time points: 29.1% (range, 2.5-46.5, p=0.003) at 3m and 30.7% (range, 2.8-62.8, p=0.003) at 6m.

Using a beam energy of 6 MV, two dose levels of 70 and 55.4 Gy were used to treat the tumour. Doses of 2 Gy in 35 fractions and 1.68 Gy in 33 fractions were simultaneously delivered for effective planning target volume (PTV1) and boost planning target volume (PTV2), respectively.Results Dose distribution in PTV and critical organs lies within tolerance dose guidelines protecting spinal cord, brain stem, optic chiasm, optic nerve, thus reducing the risk of damage to normal tissues. Minor deviation from tolerance limit was observed for parotid glands. This technique provided highly conformal and homogenous dose distribution as well as better sparing of OARs, hence verifying quality assurance results to be satisfactory.Findings SIB IMRT technique offers best solution for preserving organ function by keeping dose below tolerance level.

Radiation-induced local white matter (WM) damage has been observed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) within a priori-defined regions of interest following radiotherapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, we aimed to detect WM changes throughout the brain of NPC patients by DTI. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to analyze DTI data from 81 NPC patients. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were quantified across the whole brain in separate groups: pre-RT, and <6, 6-12, and >12 months post-RT. We found that fractional anisotropy values were significantly lower in the right frontal, parietal, and occipital WM <6 months post-RT compared with pre-RT and remained significantly lower in the right frontal and parietal WM at >12 months. MD values were significantly higher in the right occipital, bilateral temporal, right occipital-temporal junction, left parietal, left centrum semiovale, and left frontal-parietal junction WM <6 months post-RT and remained higher in the right occipital WM at >12 months.

386,"Temozolomide for central nervous system involvement in mycosis fungoides. BACKGROUND: The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most commonly involved sites in the systemic progression of primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) such as mycosis fungoides (MF). There is no consensus on the treatment of CNS progression in CTCL, but survival of 3-6 months is suggested when methotrexate-based chemotherapy and/or CNS irradiation is used. Temozolomide is active in earlier stages of MF and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. There are no published data on its use in MF patients with CNS involvement.METHODS: Four MF patients were treated with oral temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 5 d on a 28-day cycle) for CNS progression. Two patients received temozolomide with low-dose CNS irradiation as initial treatment, and two received temozolomide following disease progression after methotrexate-based chemotherapy and CNS irradiation. All patients received dexamethasone.RESULTS: Temozolomide was well tolerated; there were no treatment withdrawals or dose reductions caused by toxicity. Patient 1 had an excellent partial response in pre-irradiated disease. Patient 2 showed disease stabilization following irradiation. Patient 3 showed a complete response after a partial response to irradiation. Patient 4 demonstrated continued stabilization after a partial response to irradiation. Overall survival ranged from 10 to 33 months. Patient 3 remains alive and symptom-free at 23 months following treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Temozolomide following low-dose CNS irradiation appears to be well tolerated and effective in MF patients with CNS progression. It may represent a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy containing methotrexate or an option for second-line therapy.",Excluded
487,"Rheological characterization of the nucleus pulposus and dense collagen scaffolds intended for functional replacement. Lumbar discectomy is an effective therapy for neurological decompression in patients suffering from sciatica due to a herniated nucleus pulposus (NP). However, high numbers of patients suffering from persisting postoperative low back pain have resulted in many strategies targeting the regeneration of the NP. For successful regeneration, the stiffness of scaffolds is increasingly recognized as a potent mechanical cue for the differentiation and biosynthetic response of (stem) cells. The aim of the current study is to characterize the viscoelastic properties of the NP and to develop dense collagen scaffolds with similar properties. The scaffolds consisted of highly dense (0.5%-12%) type I collagen matrices, prepared by plastic compression. The complex modulus of the NP was 22 kPa (at 10 rad s(-1)), which should agree with a scaffold with a collagen concentration of 23%. The loss tangent, indicative of energy dissipation, is higher for the NP (0.28) than for the scaffolds (0.12) and was not dependent of the collagen density. Gamma sterilization of the scaffolds increased the shear moduli but also resulted in more brittle behavior and a reduced swelling capacity. In conclusion, by tuning the collagen density, we can approach the stiffness of the NP. Therefore, dense collagen is a promising candidate for tissue engineering of the NP that deserves further study, such as the addition of other proteins.",Excluded

Participants were stratified by stage (IIIA v IIIB), histology (nonsquamous v squamous), and therapy (surgery v none) and were randomly assigned to PCI or observation. PCI was delivered to 30 Gy in 15 fractions. The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS), neurocognitive function (NCF), and quality of life. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses were used for OS and DFS. The incidence of brain metastasis (BM) was evaluated with the logistic regression model.RESULTS: Overall, 356 patients were accrued of the targeted 1,058. The study was closed early because of slow accrual; 340 of the 356 patients were eligible. The 1-year OS (P = .86; 75.6% v 76.9% for PCI v observation) and 1-year DFS (P = .11; 56.4% v 51.2% for PCI v observation) were not significantly different. The hazard ratio for observation versus PCI was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.36). The 1-year rates of BM were significantly different (P = .004; 7.7% v 18.0% for PCI v observation).

981,"Osteoradionecrosis of the cervical spine resulting from radiotherapy for primary head and neck malignancies: operative and nonoperative management. Case report. Osteoradionecrosis is a process of dysvascular bone necrosis and fibrous replacement following exposure to high doses of radiation. The poorly vascularized necrotic tissue may cause pain and/or instability, and it cannot resist infection well, which may result in secondary osteomyelitis. When these processes affect the cervical spine, the resulting instability and neurological deficits can be devastating, and immediate reestablishment of spinal stability is paramount. Reconstruction of the cervical spine can be particularly challenging in this subgroup of patients in whom the spine is poorly vascularized after radical surgery, high-dose irradiation, and infection. The authors report three cases of cervical spine osteoradionecrosis following radiotherapy for primary head and neck malignancies. Two patients suffered secondary osteomyelitis, severe spinal deformity, and spinal cord compression. These patients underwent surgery in which a vascularized fibular graft and instrumentation were used to reconstruct the cervical spine; subsequently hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy was instituted. Fusion occurred, spinal stability was restored, and neurological dysfunction resolved at the 2- and 4-year follow-up examinations, respectively. The third patient experienced pain and dysphagia but did not have osteomyelitis, spinal instability, or neurological deficits. He underwent HBO therapy alone, with improved symptoms and imaging findings. Hyperbaric oxygen is an essential part of treatment for osteoradionecrosis and may be sufficient by itself for uncomplicated cases, but surgery is required for patients with spinal instability, spinal cord compression, and/or infection. A vascularized fibular bone graft is a very helpful adjunct in these patients because it adds little morbidity and may increase the rate of spinal fusion.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Surgery and postoperative radiation therapy are commonly used in the treatment of advanced sinonasal cancer. However, post-treatment radiation changes to the brain often mimic radiologic findings suggestive of tumor recurrence, leading to potential unnecessary intracranial biopsies. The objective of this study was to determine clinical factors that predict signs of tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis in post-therapy sinonasal malignancies with intracranial extension.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.METHODS: Twenty-six patients with sinonasal malignancy with intracranial extension underwent surgery and radiation +/- chemotherapy between 2010 and 2014 at the University of Arizona. We analyzed sinonasal cancer type, stage, total radiation dosimetry, time until imaging changes, surgical pathology, associated imaging, and patient demographics.RESULTS: Thirteen of 26 patients had postoperative imaging changes seen on surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Five were deemed to have tumor recurrence due to new metastasis seen on positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan. Four patients were observed with serial imaging that confirmed pseudoprogression. In four patients, there was sufficient concern due to persistent MRI changes, which prompted surgical biopsy, and only one of them was positive for tumor recurrence. Factors that favored tumor recurrence included faster onset of imaging changes on MRI (55 vs. 186 days, P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial tumor recurrence can be difficult to distinguish between radiation necrosis in sinonasal cancers treated with surgery and postoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy. Patients with sub-total resection and rapid onset of MRI changes in postsurveillance scans are more likely to have tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis. Future imaging techniques or tests that investigate tumor biomarkers are necessary to prevent unnecessary biopsies.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 126:2445-2450, 2016.",Excluded
372,"The functional synergism of microRNA clustering provides therapeutically relevant epigenetic interference in glioblastoma. MicroRNA deregulation is a consistent feature of glioblastoma, yet the biological effect of each single gene is generally modest, and therapeutically negligible. Here we describe a module of microRNAs, constituted by miR-124, miR-128 and miR-137, which are co-expressed during neuronal differentiation and simultaneously lost in gliomagenesis. Each one of these miRs targets several transcriptional regulators, including the oncogenic chromatin repressors EZH2, BMI1 and LSD1, which are functionally interdependent and involved in glioblastoma recurrence after therapeutic chemoradiation. Synchronizing the expression of these three microRNAs in a gene therapy approach displays significant anticancer synergism, abrogates this epigenetic-mediated, multi-protein tumor survival mechanism and results in a 5-fold increase in survival when combined with chemotherapy in murine glioblastoma models. These transgenic microRNA clusters display intercellular propagation in vivo, via extracellular vesicles, extending their biological effect throughout the whole tumor.

597,"Cranial irradiation alters dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus. Therapeutic irradiation of the brain is a common treatment modality for brain tumors, but can lead to impairment of cognitive function. Dendritic spines are sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in spine structure and number are thought to represent a morphological correlate of altered brain functions associated with hippocampal dependent learning and memory. To gain some insight into the temporal and sub region specific cellular changes in the hippocampus following brain irradiation, we investigated the effects of 10 Gy cranial irradiation on dendritic spines in young adult mice. One week or 1 month post irradiation, changes in spine density and morphology in dentate gyrus (DG) granule and CA1 pyramidal neurons were quantified using Golgi staining. Our results showed that in the DG, there were significant reductions in spine density at both 1 week (11.9%) and 1 month (26.9%) after irradiation. In contrast, in the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, irradiation resulted in a significant reduction (18.7%) in spine density only at 1 week post irradiation. Analysis of spine morphology showed that irradiation led to significant decreases in the proportion of mushroom spines at both time points in the DG as well as CA1 basal dendrites. The proportions of stubby spines were significantly increased in both the areas at 1 month post irradiation. Irradiation did not alter spine density in the CA1 apical dendrites, but there were significant changes in the proportion of thin and mushroom spines at both time points post irradiation. Although the mechanisms involved are not clear, these findings are the first to show that brain irradiation of young adult animals leads to alterations in dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus in a time dependent and region specific manner.",Included

494,"Meditation experience predicts less negative appraisal of pain: electrophysiological evidence for the involvement of anticipatory neural responses. The aim of mindfulness meditation is to develop present-focused, non-judgmental, attention. Therefore, experience in meditation should be associated with less anticipation and negative appraisal of pain. In this study we compared a group of individuals with meditation experience to a control group to test whether any differences in the affective appraisal of pain could be explained by lower anticipatory neural processing. Anticipatory and pain-evoked ERPs and reported pain unpleasantness were recorded in response to laser stimuli of matched subjective intensity between the two groups. ERP data were analysed after source estimation with LORETA. No group effects were found on the laser energies used to induce pain. More experienced meditators perceived the pain as less unpleasant relative to controls, with meditation experience correlating inversely with unpleasantness ratings. ERP source data for anticipation showed that in meditators, lower activity in midcingulate cortex relative to controls was related to the lower unpleasantness ratings, and was predicted by lifetime meditation experience. Meditators also reversed the normal positive correlation between medial prefrontal cortical activity and pain unpleasantness during anticipation. Meditation was also associated with lower activity in S2 and insula during the pain-evoked response, although the experiment could not disambiguate this activity from the preceding anticipation response. Our data is consistent with the hypothesis that meditation reduces the anticipation and negative appraisal of pain, but effects on pain-evoked activity are less clear and may originate from preceding anticipatory activity. Further work is required to directly test the causal relationship between meditation, pain anticipation, and pain experience.",Excluded

In contrast, a diminution of neurotensin plasma levels was noted, firstly at 1 day (-88%), and from 3 days after exposure (-50%). The present study suggested that changes in gastrin and neurotensin plasma levels were associated with structural alterations of the stomach and ileum, respectively, indicating that they may be relevant biological indicators of radiation-induced digestive damage to these segments.",Included
260,Ultrasonic investigations of the soleus muscle after space flight on the Biosputnik 936. The study was aimed at quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the muscle fibres and the axonal endings of the neuromuscular junctions in the soleus muscle of animals after a space flight on Biosputnik 936. Ultrastructural morphometric studies of the muscle fibres demonstrated diminished volume of sarcomer and accumulation of glycogen granules. The mean number of mitochondrial profiles decreased. The investigations of the axonal endings of the neuromuscular junctions in the soleus muscle showed diminution of the mean number of synaptic vesicles and swelling of the mitochondria. This changing in the fibres and axonal endings we can interpret as the first step of degeneration.,Included
672,"Total-body PET: Maximizing sensitivity to create new opportunities for clinical research and patient care. PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article, we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET.

478,"Sparing of normal tissues with volumetric arc radiation therapy for glioblastoma: Single institution clinical experience. Background: Patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) require radiotherapy as part of definitive management. Our institution has adopted the use of volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) due to superior sparing of the adjacent organs at risk (OARs) compared to intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Here we report our clinical experience by analyzing target coverage and sparing of OARs for 90 clinical treatment plans. Method(s): VMAT and IMRT patient cohorts comprising 45 patients each were included in this study. For all patients, the planning target volume (PTV) received 50Gy in 30 fractions, and the simultaneous integrated boost PTV received 60Gy. The characteristics of the two patient cohorts were examined for similarity. The doses to target volumes and OARs, including brain, brainstem, hippocampi, optic nerves, eyes, and cochleae were then compared using statistical analysis. Target coverage and normal tissue sparing for six patients with both clinical IMRT and VMAT plans were analyzed. Result(s): PTV coverage of at least 95% was achieved for all plans, and the median mean dose to the boost PTV differed by only 0.1Gy between the IMRT and VMAT plans. Superior sparing of the brainstem was found with VMAT, with a median difference in mean dose being 9.4Gy. The ipsilateral cochlear mean dose was lower by 19.7Gy, and the contralateral cochlea was lower by 9.5Gy. The total treatment time was reduced by 5min. The difference in the ipsilateral hippocampal D<inf>100%</inf> was 12Gy, though this is not statistically significant (P=0.03). Conclusion(s): VMAT for GBM patients can provide similar target coverage, superior sparing of the brainstem and cochleae, and be delivered in a shorter period of time compared with IMRT. The shorter treatment time may improve clinical efficiency and the quality of the treatment experience. Based on institutional clinical experience, use of VMAT for the treatment of GBMs appears to offer no inferiority in comparison to IMRT and may offer distinct advantages, especially for patients who may require re-irradiation.

686,"Acute complications following gamma knife radiosurgery are rare. BACKGROUND: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) is a safe and effective alternative to surgery for intracranial lesions. Most studies evaluating toxicity after GKR have concentrated on the delayed radiation effects.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 835 consecutive GKR cases for early (within 7 days) neurological complications or death.RESULTS: We identified a total of 18 patients (2.2%) who had a neurological event or death. Five (0.6%) patients developed new focal deficits, 12 (1.4%) patients experienced a seizure and there were three (0.4%) deaths. Two deaths were related to development of seizures and neurological deterioration. One death was caused by a respiratory arrest related to the patient's primary cancer. Of the five patients with neurological deficits, none had a persistent deficit. In two cases the neurological deficits were due to an increase in edema. Whether this occurred as a result of the gamma knife treatment or was the natural progression of the tumor is unclear.CONCLUSIONS: Complications after GKR are uncommon and the risk of a permanent deficit arising from an acute neurological event is exceedingly low.",Excluded
754,"Neuroinflammatory changes of the normal brain tissue in cured mice following combined radiation and anti-PD-1 blockade therapy for glioma. The efficacy of combining radiation therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor blockade to treat brain tumors is currently the subject of multiple investigations and holds significant therapeutic promise. However, the long-term effects of this combination therapy on the normal brain tissue are unknown. Here, we examined mice that were intracranially implanted with murine glioma cell line and became long-term survivors after treatment with a combination of 10 Gy cranial irradiation (RT) and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade (aPD-1). Post-mortem analysis of the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to tumor implantation showed complete abolishment of hippocampal neurogenesis, but neural stem cells were well preserved in subventricular zone. In addition, we observed a drastic reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the subcortical white matter. Importantly, this observation was evident specifically in the combined (RT+aPD-1) treatment group but not in the single treatment arm of either RT alone or aPD-1 alone. Elimination of microglia with a small molecule inhibitor of colony stimulated factor-1 receptor (PLX5622) prevented the loss of mature oligodendrocytes. These results identify for the first time a unique pattern of normal tissue changes in the brain secondary to combination treatment with radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The results also suggest a role for microglia as key mediators of the adverse treatment effect.",Excluded

1043,"Fra-1 mediated regulation of CD44 expression in malignant brain tumor cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common form of primary brain tumors. It is a highly aggressive tumor, characterized by an increased proliferation rate and a high capacity to invade surrounding tissues. Currently, GBM treatment includes surgical resection followed by radiation and/or chemotherapy. However, these therapeutic options often do not alter the infiltrative and migratory capacity of GBMs. The invasive migration of glioblastoma multiforme has been associated with CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein and the principle receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA). The molecular basis of CD44 regulation regulated in GBM is not fully understood. However, CD44 regulation has been shown to be by an AP-1 transcription factor family member, fos-related antigen (Fra-1) in an equally aggressive cancer, mesothelioma. To better understand how Fra-1 regulates cell adhesion and migration, we performed adhesion and wound healing assays on human GBM cell lines. To determine whether malignant brain tumor cell adhesion is mediated by Fra-1 expression, we analyzed GBM cell adhesion to HA. U-1242 MG cells were transfected with siRNA directed against Fra-1 and treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/ml). Adherence to HA increases in U-1242 MG cell lines following growth factor simulation, but was inhibited when the cells were transfected with Fra-1 siRNA. Using another GBM cell line A-172, and its clones, A-172 MW6 (Fra-1 dominant negative) and A-172 MW12 (Fra-1 overexpressors) we examined the migratory capacity of these cells. A-172 MW6 cells exhibit a slower migration rate than cells with higher levels of Fra-1 expression. Collectively, our results suggest that Fra-1 regulates CD44 expression in human GBM cells, which in turn affects GBM cell adhesion and migration.",Excluded
631,"Three-dimensional dosimetric evaluation of a conventional radiotherapy technique for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Background and purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate and delineate the deficiencies in conventional two-dimensional (2-D) radiotherapy planning of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treatment and to explore the means for improvement of the existing treatment technique aiming at enhancing local tumor control and reducing treatment complications. Methods and materials: Ten patients with NPC sparing the skull base and without intracranial extension or cranial nerve(s) palsy were chosen in the present study. Two sets of CT images for Phases I and II of the radiotherapy treatment were taken with patient immobilized in the flexed-head and the extended-head positions, respectively. Based on the CT images and endoscopic findings, the gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined. The clinical target volume (CTV) circumscribing the GTV was defined according to Ho's (Halnan, K.E. (ed.) Treatment of Cancer. London: Chapman and Hall, 1982. pp. 249-268) description of the organs at risk of tumor infiltration. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined by adding a margin to the CTV which catered for geometrical inaccuracies. The field borders and shields were set at standard distances from certain bony landmarks and were drawn on the simulator radiograph. Data on the beams and shield arrangements were then transferred to the planning computer via a digitizer. By applying 3-D volumetric dose calculation using a commercial three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning computer, the dose-volume-histograms (DVHs) of GTV, CTV, PTV and critical normal organs were generated for both phases of Ho's treatment technique. The same patients were re-planned using a modified Ho's technique which used 3-D beams-eye-view (BEV) in placing the shielding blocks and the same set of DVHs were generated and compared with those obtained from Ho's technique. Result(s): The median volumes of GTV, CTV and PTV covered by the 95% isodose in Ho's phase I treatment were around 60%. The dose coverage was unsatisfactory in the superior and inferior and the posterolateral regions. In phase II treatment, the median volume of GTV, CTV and PTV covered by the 95% isodose were 99, 96 and 72%, respectively. Even though the dose coverage of the PTV in both phases of treatment were unsatisfactory, radiotherapy with the original Ho's technique had consistently produced good local control for NPC. However, there is potential room for enhancing the local control further because after modifying Ho's technique by using 3-D BEV customization of the treatment portals, the median volume of the target covered by the 95% isodose was defined as V<inf>95</inf>. The V<inf>95</inf> of the PTV during the Phase II treatment was improved by 13%. The 90% of the volume of temporo-mandibular joints and parotid glands were both irradiated to 53 Gy and 43.6 Gy of the total prescribed dose of 66 Gy, respectively, in phase I and II treatments. With the addition of a hypothalamus-pituitary shield to Ho's technique, 50% of the volume of optic chiasma and temporal lobes received, respectively, 19.3 Gy and 4.5 Gy. However, small volume of the temporal lobes received a maximum dose (D<inf>max</inf>) of 62.8 Gy (95.2% of 66Gy). Most of the brainstem was shielded from the lateral portals but 5% of its volume received a dose ranging from 25.4 to 50.4Gy. The spinal cord (at C1/C2 level) received a D<inf>max</inf> of 40.8 Gy in phase I and of 4.8 Gy in phase II. After modifying Ho's technique by 3-D BEV customization of the treatment portals, the D<inf>max</inf> to the brainstem, the optic chiasma and the temporal lobes could be reduced by 8, 12 and 5%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Our study indicated that the dose-coverage of the PTV in Ho's radiotherapy technique for the early T-stage NPC was less than satisfactory in the superior and inferior and the posterolateral regions. However, in view of the excellent historical local tumor control with Ho's technique, we have to postulate that the present definition of CTV (and hence the PTV after adding margins to the CTV) lacks clinical significance and can be improved. It appears that the inclusion of the entire sphenoid sinus floor and both medial and lateral pterygoid muscles in the CTV is not necessary for maximal tumor control in the absence of clinical/radiological evidence of tumor infiltration of these organs. Ho's technique can be improved by using 3-D BEV to customize the treatment portals with multileaf collimators or blocks. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1093,"Endogenous adenosine modulates epileptiform activity in rat hippocampus in a receptor subtype-dependent manner. The purine nucleoside adenosine is released during seizure activity and exerts an anticonvulsant influence through inhibition of glutamate release and hyperpolarization of neurons via adenosine A(1) receptors. However, activation of adenosine A(2A) and A(3) receptors may counteract the inhibitory effects of A(1) receptors. We have therefore examined the extent to which endogenous adenosine released during seizure activity activates the different adenosine receptor subtypes and the implications for seizure activity in the rat hippocampus in vitro. Brief trains of high-frequency stimulation in nominally Mg(2+)-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid evoked epileptiform activity and resulted in a transient depression of the simultaneously recorded CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potential. In the presence of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT), an adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist, the occurrence of spontaneous seizure activity was greatly increased as was the duration and intensity of evoked seizures, whilst the postictal depression of basal synaptic transmission was greatly attenuated. Application of ZM 241385, an adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist, shortened the duration of epileptiform activity, whereas administration of MRS 1191, an adenosine A(3) receptor antagonist, both decreased the duration and intensity of seizures. Combined application of the A(2A) and A(3) receptor antagonists also resulted in a reduction in seizure duration and intensity. However, no evidence was found for a role for protein kinase C in the regulation of seizure activity by endogenous adenosine. Our data confirm the dominant anticonvulsant role that endogenous and tonic adenosine play via the A(1) receptor, and suggest that the additional adenosine receptor subtypes may compromise this anticonvulsant property through promotion of seizure activity.",Excluded
931,"Experiences of patients receiving treatment with ceritinib to treat ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer: A qualitative study. Background: Ceritinib (Zykadia) is a recently approved second-line agent for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The current study sought to describe healthcare providers' (HCPs) decisions to treat with ceritinib and to describe patientreported side effects, perceived effectiveness and attitudes toward ceritinib. Method(s): One-on-one telephone interviews were conducted with HCPs caring for patients treated with ceritinib using a semi-structured interview guide designed to explore treatment decision-making, adverse events (AEs) and their management. Patients with current or past experience of ceritinib completed semi-structured telephone interviews designed to capture their experience. A thematic analysis of interview transcripts was conducted using qualitative analysis software, MaxQDA. Result(s): Study participants comprised 10 HCPs (6 oncologists, 4 nurses) and 18 patients (9 female) aged 34-78 years (mean=51.0; SD=11.3). HCPs reported relying on two main factors when deciding to switch patients to ceritinib or to next-line treatment after ceritinib: evidence of sufficient clear-cut progression and poor tolerance to treatment. Four HCPs reported considering clinical trials or other newly approved drugs instead of ceritinib. Patients and HCPs concurred that the most frequently reported side effects of ceritinib include diarrhea (n=15 patients; n=9 HCPs), nausea (n=13; n=10), vomiting (n=12; n=6), and abdominal pain (n=10; n=7). Dose reduction, antiemetic and anti-diarrheal medications, and home remedies (e.g. ginger ale, crackers) were reported as being effective at managing these side effects prophylactically or once they occurred. Taking ceritinib with food was reported by 5 patients and 4 HCPs, and helped to improve nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. Patients reported that ceritinib was effective in achieving or maintaining symptom control for cough (n=12 of 12 patients symptomatic at diagnosis) and shortness of breath (n=9 of 11 patients symptomatic at diagnosis). Of 14 patients with lung tumors at start of ceritinib, 13 reported positive tumor response during treatment. Three of 7 patients with brain metastases achieved reduction or no evidence of disease with ceritinib in combination with other interventions (e.g., radiation). Patients were asked what they liked about ceritinib: tumor response and symptom control, an extension of life, or improvement in quality of life were key themes. Patient-reported dislikes included side effects and number of pills. Of 14 patients asked specifically, all stated the benefits of ceritinib outweigh its side effects. Conclusion(s): Patients perceived ceritinib as an effective treatment for ALK+NSCLC. AEs were reported to be manageable and patients were willing to manage these in order to experience the treatment benefits.",Excluded
1157,"Induction by cyclic GMP of cationic conductance in plasma membrane of retinal rod outer segment. Vertebrate rod photoreceptors hyperpolarize when illuminated, due to the closing of cation-selective channels in the plasma membrane. The mechanism controlling the opening and closing of these channels is still unclear, however. Both 3',5'-cyclic GMP and Ca2+ ions have been proposed as intracellular messengers for coupling the light activation of the photopigment rhodopsin to channel activity and thus modulating light-sensitive conductance. We have now studied the effects of possible conductance modulators on excised 'inside-out' patches from the plasma membrane of the rod outer segment (ROS), and have found that cyclic GMP acting from the inner side of the membrane markedly increases the cationic conductance of such patches (EC50 30 microM cyclic GMP) in a reversible manner, while Ca2+ is ineffective. The cyclic GMP-induced conductance increase occurs in the absence of nucleoside triphosphates and, hence, is not mediated by protein phosphorylation, but seems rather to result from a direct action of cyclic GMP on the membrane. The effect of cyclic GMP is highly specific; cyclic AMP and 2',3'-cyclic GMP are completely ineffective when applied in millimolar concentrations. We were unable to recognize discrete current steps that might represent single-channel openings and closings modulated by cyclic GMP. Analysis of membrane current noise shows the elementary event to be 3 fA with 110 mM Na+ on both sides of the membrane at a membrane potential of -30 mV. If the initial event is assumed to be the closure of a single cyclic GMP-sensitive channel, this value corresponds to a single-channel conductance of 100 fS. It seems probable that the cyclic GMP-sensitive conductance is responsible for the generation of the rod photoresponse in vivo.",Excluded
80,"High-dose-rate intraoperative brachytherapy for recurrent colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: Management of locally recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma represents a significant challenge. Many of these tumors adhere to or invade into vital pelvic structures rendering surgery or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) as palliative treatment. Therefore, a treatment approach was developed to evaluate the role of high-dose-rate intraoperative brachytherapy (HDR-IORT) and surgery as a component of therapy in the management of locally recurrent colorectal cancer. This is an update of our preliminary report with longer follow-up and larger patient numbers.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 1992 and September 1998, 74 patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer were treated with surgery and HDR-IORT. Additional EBRT was given to 29 patients, and 33 patients received 5-fluorouracil based chemotherapy. All patients underwent complete gross resection, and 21 of 74 had positive microscopic margin. The dose of HDR-IORT ranged from 10 to 18 Gy.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 22 months, the 5-year local control, distant metastasis disease-free, disease-free, and overall survival rates were 39%, 39%, 23%, and 23%, respectively. The only predictor of improved local control was a negative margin of resection with a 5-year local control rate of 43%, compared to 26% in those with positive margin (p = 0.02). For overall survival, a negative microscopic margin (p = 0.04) and the use of IORT + EBRT (p = 0.04) were significant predictors of improved survival. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 16%.CONCLUSION: The results with HDR-IORT in this group of patients are encouraging. Further improvements in local and distant control are still needed.",Excluded

The main goal thereby is to maintain in-flight and post-flight performance capabilities of the astronauts (Loehr et al., 2015). Crewmembers are commanded to adhere to their personal exercise protocols, including resistance (ARED) and cardiovascular exercise on a Treadmill or Veloergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System (TVIS, CEVIS). The training devices save personal data as well as physiological and training parameter, which allows the Mission Control Center (based on Earth) to adjust individual exercise schedules. Since the installation of the ARED in the International Space Station Expedition 18, high resistances can be applied during strength training on the ISS and the device allows about 29 different exercises. However, the ARED is very space-consuming and carries the potential risk of being temporarily unavailable due to technical faults (Hanson et al., 2014; Loehr et al., 2015), which motivates the search for and the exploration of smaller and technically simpler devices (Behringer et al., 2016). In addition, high training intensities are associated with an increased risk of injury to the musculoskeletal system (Gabbett, 2016), a fact to be taken seriously, as training-related injuries are the most common source of injury to astronauts on board the ISS (Scheuring et al., 2009). Therefore, the question arises whether BFR training can be a reasonable alternative or supplement for in-flight training sessions.

Thermoregulatory responses to solar radiation in the eland and hartebeest were examined in the natural radiative environment by determining the relationships of sweating and panting to skin and rectal temperatures. For the hydrated eland, the thermoregulatory mechanisms of panting and sweating were related to skin and not to rectal temperature, the onset occurring at a threshold skin temperature of 31.2-31.3degreeC, respectively. When dehydrated, panting and sweating were delayed until threshold skin temperature of 35.1 and 35.7 respectively, and both were now also related to a rising rectal temperature. In the hartebeest, panting is the only regulated thermoregulatory mechanism. When fully hydrated, panting frequency of the hartebeest was related to skin temperature, the onset occurring at 33.4degreeC. However, when dehydrated, regulation of panting shifted to a rising rectal temperature, the onset of polypnea occurring at a threshold rectal temperature of 39.5degreeC. During dehydration, the sensitivity and magnitude of the panting frequency in both species were enhanced. It is postulated that peripheral thermal sensitivity in these African antelopes when hydrated helps maintain thermal homeostasis in response to increase in the radiative load. When dehydrated, rigid thermal homeostasis is abandoned to conserve water with a resultant hyperthermia. However, in both species, it is suggested that the brain is protected from hyperthermia by an enhanced sensitivity of the panting mechanism.",Excluded

The iterative method used was an ordered subset expectation maximization (OS- EM) algorithm. A cylinder containing small cold spheres was used to calculate contrast-to-noise curves. For a brain study, global errors between reconstruction and 'true' distributions were calculated. Results show that ISR is superior to all other methods. In all cases considered, ISM is superior to ISE and performs approximately as well as (brain study) or better than (cylinder data) ISE-NF. Both ISM and ISE improve contrast-to-noise curves and reduce global errors, compared with NSC. In the case of ISE, blurring of the scatter estimate with a Gaussian kernel results in slightly reduced errors in brain studies, especially at low count levels. The optimal Gaussian kernel size is strongly dependent on the noise level.",Excluded

Background: This study aims to investgate the effect of reference dose calculaton grid size (RDCGS) on gamma passing rate (GPR) for patent-specific quality assurance of intensity-modulated radiaton therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 20 patents were retrospectvely selected. Both IMRT and VMAT plans were generated for each patent. Reference dose distributons for gamma analysis were calculated with RDCGS of 1-5 mm at intervals of 1 mm. Dose distributons were measured using MapCHECK2 and ArcCHECK dosimeters. Both global and local gamma analyses with gamma criteria of 3%/3 mm, 2%/3 mm, 2%/2 mm, and 2%/1 mm were performed with various RDCGS. Result(s): As the RDCGS increased from 1 mm to 5 mm, the average global GPRs with 2%/2 mm for VMAT with MapCHECK2 and ArcCHECK decreased by 9.3% and 5.9%, respectvely. The average local GPRs decreased by 14% and 11.7%, respectvely. For IMRT, the global GPRs decreased by 4.8% and 6%, respectvely, whereas the local GPRs decreased by 10.5% and 8.6%, respectvely. The effect of the RDCGS on the GPRs became larger when performing local gamma analysis as well as when applying small distance-to-agreement (DTA). As the RDCGS increased, the average changes in the GPR per mm of DTA change increased regardless of the type of radiotherapy, detector, or gamma analysis. Conclusion(s): For an accurate verificaton of the IMRT and VMAT plans, it is recommended that the reference dose distributon must be calculated with the smallest possible RDCGS.

30,"AlphaB-crystallin (aBC) expression in breast cancer brain metastases (BM) and primary breast cancer (pBC) with eventual BM and association with outcome. Background: aBC, a small heat shock protein, is commonly expressed in basal BC and predicts poor survival in BC patients (pts). aBC has been associated with the development of BM within basal BC. We evaluated the expression of aBC in BM and pBC with eventual BM and its association with survival. Method(s): Under IRB approval (UNC/Duke), we established a clinically-annotated biobank from 78 pts: 51 BM and 38 pBC with eventual BM (11 were matched BC and BM pairs); 59 pts had complete treatment (tx) data. IHC subtype was assigned for BM and pBC: HR+ (hormone receptor)/HER2-, triple-negative (TN; ER-/PR-/HER2-), and HR+or-/HER2+. aBC expression was based on % of positively stained tumor cells: negative (0%), weak (<30%) and strong positive (30%). Overall survival (OS) and survival after BM were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test). Result(s): Median age was 50 yrs (26-84). 67% were Caucasian, 32% African American. 90% received systemic tx for metastatic BC, of which 67% followed BM. 90% received local tx (resection and/or radiation) for BM. There was no difference in receipt of local or systemic tx by aBC. Subtype for pBC (n=36) was 31% (HR+/HER2-), 42% (TN), and 28% (HR+or-/HER2+); for BM (n=42) 33%, 43% and 24%, respectively. aBC was expressed in 37% (14/38) of pBC and 47% (24/51) of BM. Concordance of aBC expression between pBC and BM was 55% (6/11). Gain of aBC expression (4/11) was more common in BM than loss (1/11). aBC was more commonly expressed in TNBC (pBC 73%; BM 67%) compared to HR+/HER2- (pBC 9%; 29% BM) or HR+or-/HER2+ (pBC 0%; 30% BM). OS and survival after BM differed by subtype (all p<0.02); pts with TNBC experienced the poorest outcome. OS and survival after BM was inferior for all pts (n=38) and those with TNBC (n=15) whose pBC expressed aBC (Table). aBC expression within BM was not prognostic (p>0.05). Conclusion(s): aBC expression in BM and pBC with eventual BM is frequent and associated with TNBC. Among pts with BM, expression of aBC in the pBC predicts for inferior OS and survival after BM even among poor prognosis pts with TNBC BM. (Table Presented).",Excluded

180,"Complications of radiation therapy: the genitourinary tract. Radiation effects on normal tissue are inherent in the radiation treatment of patients with cancer. The aim of the radiation therapist is to achieve the highest possible cure rate with the lowest possible complication rate; to avoid these complications entirely would mean lowering the cure rate. Radiation effects may be acute, occurring during the course of treatment, or subacute or chronic, arising months or years after treatment has been completed. One of the basic problems the clinician and radiologist face is to differentiate radiation effect from recurrence of cancer. The anatomic areas covered in this paper include the kidneys, ureters, bladder, male and female genital tracts, and the embryo and fetus. The clinical conditions include lymphoma and neuroblastoma; cancer of the cervix, uterus, ovary, kidney, bladder, prostate, and rectosigmoid; and vertebral body and spinal cord tumors. The ovary, testis, embryo, and fetus may also be irradiated inadvertently during diagnostic radiologic examination or radioisotope study.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The optimal chemotherapy regimen for concurrent chemoradiation in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. Cisplatin-etoposide regimen related toxicity is high, weekly regimens have been investigating. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of different concurrent chemotherapy regimens in the context.METHODS: A total of 225 patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC were included. Patients who were treated with weekly docetaxel-platin (DP), paclitaxel-platin (PP) and standard dose etoposide-platin (EP) chemotherapy regimens were selected and divided into groups for the comparison of toxicity, response rate, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) times.RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between overall response rate of each treatment groups (DP: 96.1%, PP: 94% and EP: 76.7%, p < 0.001). The median PFS time of patients who were treated with DP, PP and EP was 16, 15 and 13.3 months, respectively (p = 0.435). The median OS time of patients treated with DP, PP and EP was 19.2, 29.7 and 28.3 months, respectively (p < 0.001). The rates of adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, neuropathy and anaphylaxis was similar. Grade 1-2 mucositis or esophagitis, anemia, pneumonitis were significantly higher in PP group than other groups. However, hematologic toxicities were higher in the EP group than other groups.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the weekly chemotherapy regimens with the standard dose, our study demonstrated similar PFS, but a prolonged OS with the EP regimen. The clinical response rate of weekly regimens was better than the full-dose regimen. Adverse events and toxicity rates were different and depended on the type of chemotherapy regimen used.",Excluded
82,"Utility of cranial boost in addition to total body irradiation in the treatment of high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Purpose: Total body irradiation (TBI) as part of a conditioning regimen before hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an important component in the management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has relapsed or has other certain high-risk features. Controversy exists, however, as to whether a cranial boost in addition to TBI is necessary to prevent central nervous system (CNS) recurrences in these high-risk cases. Previous national trials have included a cranial boost in the absence of data to justify its use. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess risk of CNS recurrence in ALL patients treated with TBI, to identify subsets of these high-risk patients at an increased or decreased risk of CNS recurrence after TBI, and to investigate whether regimens with higher doses of cranial irradiation further reduce the risk of CNS recurrence. Methods and Materials: Charts of 67 consecutively treated patients with ALL who received TBI before HSCT were reviewed. Data including patient demographics, clinical features at presentation, conditioning regimen, donor source, use of a cranial boost, remission stage at transplant, histologic subtype, cytogenetics, and extramedullary site of presentation were retrospectively collected and correlated with the risk of subsequent CNS recurrence. Result(s): At the time of analysis, 30 (45%) patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 8 (12%) were alive with recurrence of leukemia, 7 (10.5%) had recurrent ALL but with successful salvage, 7 (11%) died subsequent to recurrence, 14 (21%) died from complications related to HCST, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up (1.5%). Of the patients who recurred after HSCT, the relapses were hematologic in 13 (57%), CNS with or without simultaneous marrow involvement in 3 (13%), and other sites in 7 (30%). Forty-one (61%) patients did not receive an extracranial boost of irradiation with TBI. Two of these patients (4.9%) suffered CNS failures compared with 1 of 26 (3.8%) who received a cranial boost (p = 0.84). None of the 40 patients who presented only with hematologic disease developed a CNS recurrence despite the fact that only 13 of 40 of these patients received a cranial boost after TBI. Cranial boost was therefore not associated with a reduction in CNS recurrence, especially in patients with only hematologic disease at presentation for which there were no failures regardless of the use of additional cranial radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): Patients who present with hematologic disease only at the time of HSCT have a low risk of CNS recurrence after TBI regardless of the use of a cranial boost, suggesting that a cranial boost may not be necessary in these patients. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
112,"Static magnetic field exposure affects behavior and learning in rats. The present work investigated the behavioral effects of a moderate exposure (1 h per day for 5 consecutive days) to a static magnetic field (SMF, 128 mT) in male rats. SMF effects were evaluated in two sets of control and SMF-exposed rats. One set of animals was used for evaluation of SMF potential effects on emotional behaviors in the elevated plus maze and in the open field. The other set of animals was tested for learning and memory abilities in different procedures of the Morris water maze task. We found no significant difference between control and SMF-exposed rats in anxiety tests. However, the ratio of open arms time in the plus maze was reduced by half in SMF-exposed rats. In the Morris water maze, SMF-exposed rats were partially impaired during the initial learning task as well as in the retention task at one week. We conclude that static magnetic field exposure altered emotional behaviors in the plus maze and led to cognitive impairments, or at least to substantial attention disorders, in the Morris water maze.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: Objective - to estimate the possible effects of low dose ionizing radiation on human cognitive function in adult hood and in utero.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive tests, telomere length and expression of genes regulating telomere function were studied in Chornobyl cleanup workers who were exposed to doses under 500 mSv (n = 326) and subjects exposed in utero during the first days after the accident Prypiat town (n = 104). The neurocognitive assessment covered mem ory, attention, language, executive and visiospatial functions. In young adults after prenatal exposure a relation ship was analyzed between a cognitive function and radiation dose to foetus, brain and thyroid gland. Internal con trols were used for both groups - the group of Chornobyl cleanup workers exposed in doses less than 20 mSv and an age matched comparison group from radioactively contaminated areas for subjects exposed in utero.RESULTS: Cognitive functions in cleanup workers exposed to ionizing radiation at adulthood are characterized by symptoms of a mild cognitive impairment according to the MMSE (mean group score 25,58 +/- 2,95) and a significant ly higher level of mental disorders according to the BPRS in a dose related manner. Cleanup workers exposed to doses over 500 mSv demonstrate a significant cognitive deficit in comparison with those exposed below 500 mSv and espe cially non exposed patients. Subjects exposed in utero during the check at age of 25-27 years exhibit an excess of the disorders of autonomic nervous system (ICD 10: G90). Neurological microsymptoms as well as neurotic, stress relat ed and somatoform disorders (F40-F48) dominate. Relationship were revealed between the TERT, TERF1, TERF2 genes expression, relative telomere length (RTL),cognitive deficit and cerebrovascular pathology, radiation dose and age. Telomere length in cleanup workers is sreduced after 50 years (6.1 %). The most significant reduction in telomere length is shown after 70 years (11.7 %). Negative correlation was found between telomere length and degree of cog nitive deficit (MMSE scale) and between age and degree of cognitive deficit. The RTL is significantly decreased in groups of persons with cognitive deficit compared to a comparison group. Telomere length at the late period after low dose radiation exposure is downregulated by the high TERF2 gene expression combined with low expression of TERT gene. After exposure to doses over 250-500 mSv a cognitive deficit and dementia were associated with a substantial increase in TERT gene expression, overexpression of TERF1 and decrease in expression of TERF2 gene. A relationship was revealed between the TERF2 gene expression and CD95+ cell fraction susceptible to apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that cognitive deficit in humans at a late period after radiation exposure is influ enced by dose, age at exposure and gene regulation of telomere function.",Included

The duration of the latent period was found to be directly proportional to the age of the animal at the time of irradiation, and independent of radiation dose or the volume of the cervical cord which was irradiated. In the majority of paretic animals, the irradiated segment of the spinal cord demonstrated white matter necrosis. The results indicate that in the developing rat, the manifestations of radiation myelopathy are delayed by an interval determined in part by the age of the animal at the time of irradiation.",Included

Disseminated neuroendocrine tumours are difficult to treat and are generally not responsive to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Nuclear medicine techniques using a radiolabelled somatostatin analogue, 111In-Octreotide, have been used for the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours. It has been suggested that high activities of such an agent may have a therapeutic effect. The aims of this study were to assess toxicity and to determine if there had been evidence of efficacy. Eight patients with known disseminated neuroendocrine tumours were enrolled in the study; six had carcinoid tumours, one had a medullary cell carcinoma of the thyroid and one patient had a malignant gastrinoma. Between 1.3 and 4.6 GBq of 111In-Octreotide were administered to each patient for up to five administrations over 12 months. A total of 23 administrations were given. Tests of vital signs, renal, liver and endocrine function as well as haematological markers were taken before and after treatment. The treatment was well tolerated with only one patient suffering from a sensation of flushing during the infusion but no changes in vital sings. There was a transient (up to 48 h) drop in circulating lymphocytes in four patients and platelets in two patients; no supportive therapy was needed. One patient with severe renal impairment had a slight reduction in glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that high-activity 111In-Octreotide is well tolerated with low toxicity and can be considered for use in patients with disseminated neuroendocrine tumours.

1069,"Activation of ERG2 potassium channels by the diphenylurea NS1643. Three members of the ERG potassium channel family have been described (ERG1-3 or Kv 11.1-3). ERG1 is by far the best characterized subtype and it constitutes the molecular component of the cardiac I(Kr) current. All three channel subtypes are expressed in neurons but their function remains unclear. The lack of functional information is at least partly due to the lack of specific pharmacological tools. The compound NS1643 has earlier been reported as an ERG1 channel activator. We found that NS1643 also activates the ERG2 channel; however, the molecular mechanism of the activation differs between the ERG1 and ERG2 channels. This is surprising since ERG1 and ERG2 channels have very similar biophysical and structural characteristics. For ERG2, NS1643 causes a left-ward shift of the activation curve, a faster time-constant of activation and a slower time-constant of inactivation as well as an increased relative importance for the fast component of deactivation to the total deactivation. In contrast, for ERG1, NS1643 causes a right-ward shift in the voltage-dependent release from inactivation but does not affect time-constants of deactivation. Because of these differences in the responses of ERG1 and ERG2 to NS1643, NS1643 can be used as a pharmacological tool to address ERG channel function. It may be useful for revealing physiological functions of ERG channels in neuronal tissue as well as to elucidate the structure-function relationships of the ERG channels.",Excluded
516,"Physiological changes in glucose differentially modulate the excitability of hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone and orexin neurons in situ. The physiological signaling mechanisms that link normal variations in body energy status to the activity of arousal- and metabolism-regulating brain centers are not well understood. The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin/hypocretin types of neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) exert opposing effects on arousal and metabolism. We examined whether shifts in brain extracellular glucose that correspond to physiological changes in blood glucose can alter the electrical output of neurochemically and biophysically defined LH cells in mouse brain slices. Here, we show that physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose dose-dependently enhance the electrical excitability of MCH neurons by inducing depolarization and increasing membrane resistance. We also demonstrate that the same physiological shifts in glucose have the opposite effects on the electrical activity of orexin neurons. We propose that these direct actions of glucose on the arousal- and metabolism-regulating LH neurons play a key role in the translation of normal variations in body energy resources into appropriate changes in arousal and metabolism.",Excluded

1072,"Quantitative assessment of cerebral hemodynamics using perfusion-weighted MRI in patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease: comparison with positron emission tomography. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to acetazolamide is a key parameter in determining the severity of hemodynamic impairment in patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease. Perfusion-weighted MRI (PW MRI) can measure the cerebral blood volume (CBV) as an indicator of hemodynamic impairment. CBV measured by PW MRI was compared with CVR measured by positron emission tomography (PET).METHODS: Twelve normal subjects and 17 patients with major cerebral artery occlusive disease underwent PW MRI and PET. The images were coregistered with 3-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition images. Quantitative PW MRI-CBV maps were generated using the indicator dilution method with arterial input function. One large cortical region of interest for each unilateral middle cerebral artery territory was determined on each image. PET-CVR was calculated by measuring cerebral blood flow before and after acetazolamide challenge.RESULTS: A significant negative correlation was observed between PW MRI-CBV and PET-CVR (r=-0.713; P<0.0001). PW MRI-CBV higher than the mean +2 SD obtained in normal subjects (15.2 mL/100 g) was defined as elevated and PET-CVR lower than the mean -2 SD obtained in normal subjects (15.1%) was defined as reduced. Assuming the PET-CVR as the true determinant of hemodynamic impairment, PW MRI-CBV provided 80.0% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity, with 80.0% positive predictive value for detecting patients with reduced CVR.CONCLUSIONS: The PW MRI-CBV method can simply and accurately identify patients with hemodynamic impairment without exposure to ionizing radiation.",Excluded
362,"Refresher course: Ultrasound guided chronic pain management: Evidence and practice. Ultrasound has become a popular tool utilized in the performance of chronic pain interventions. Traditionally, procedures in pain medicine were performed using anatomic landmarks, fluoroscopy or CT scan. While the semodalities continue to be utilized, there has been a tremendous growth in the use of ultrasound by pain practitioners. Interventional techniques for acute and chronic pain management have traditionally performed upon a combination of anatomical landmarks, electron eurostimulation or imaging. All this techniques are usefull but, ENS has no help in avoiding puncture of vessels, pleura or other structure. Fluoroscopy is effective for visualization of bony structures but not soft tissues. It thus has limitations when performing procedures for peripheral procedures. While CT scan is better than fluoroscopy for visualization of bony structures and soft tissue, it can be cost prohibitive and is associated with significant radiation exposure to the patient and practitioner Most pain management guidelines have moved towards recommending image guidance such as ultrasound, fluoroscopy or CT scan for interventional procedures. This is largely due to the increased accuracy, reliability (precision) and safety associated with structure visualization. Ultrasound can identify other structures asmuscles, ligaments, vessels, joint and bony surfaces. An ultrasound machine is affordable, portable and does not diffuse radiation, its use has not be associated with any risk both for patients and practitioners. The image that we can see is real time and can be performed continuously along the procedure Ultrasound can be implemented in office-based practice for diagnostic and therapeutic injections. Mergin experience from various specialities seems to be a way for forward. Musculoskeletal US experts (radiologists, rheumatologists) may help to develop skills in joint injections. Trigger point injections (including Botulinum Toxin A) are not longer to be blind but specific group of muscle can be targeted and potential complications (pneumothorax, intraperitoneal, intravaascular injections) avoided. Anesthetists with experience with peripheral nerve blocks under ultrasound guidance naturally progress to blocks in field of chronic pain. Chronic pain procedures may include nerve blocks, many spinal approches, including epidurals, selective nerve block, facet joints, medial branch blocks and sympathetic blocks. More recently ultrasound guidance has been used as aid placement of peripheral neuromodulation electrodes. What limitations. High frequency probe providing high resolution pictures but will not penetrate deep tissue. Low frequency probe penetrates deeper but quality of pictures is degradeed. Structures like bones are not easily penetrated by ultrasound wave producing scattering or artifacts. Spine procedures: The primary advantage of ultrasonography (besides no radiation exposure) is direct visualization of soft tissue structures, it is particularly beneficial in cervical spine injections, where the multitude of blood vessels and other vital soft tissue structures make this area particularly vulnerable to injury if only fluoroscopy-guided injections are used. Ultrasound is an excellent tool in ""visualizing"" and, hence, ""avoiding"" vascular injury during cervical spine procedures, whereas contrast fluoroscopy can only ""detect"" when the tip of the needle is intravascular. One should be mindful that fluoroscopy may not detect that the needle has already traversed a vessel on its way to the target, whereas ultrasound can avoid this. Ultrasound guided lumbar intra-articular and medial branch block was compared to the most commonly used fluoroscopically guided approach. Very good result were obtained with US technique but limitations also exist when compared to fluoroscopically based technique. These limitiations are: obese patients, chllenge in detecting intravascular injection at such a depth, the possible need for a larger-gauge needle to improve visibility[1]. Thus despite the increasing number of paper published no recomandations can be given at this time if US is superior to fluoroscopy. On the contrary third occipital nerve block under fluoroscopy has a false positive rate of 38% and accurate needle placement up to 82% has been achieved with US guidance[2]. Also US guided stellate ganglion block helps in decreasing complications. With the anatomical landmarks trechnique several side effects or complications can occur. Puncture of the oesophagus leading to mediastinitis or carotid artery or other thyroids vessels puncture are serous complications. US guidance increases the incidence of successful sympathetic block and lowers the incidence of hoarseness associated with local anesthetic injections above the prevertebral fascia.[3] US guidance is very helpfull in border nerve syndromes (genitofemoral, iliinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves) where anatomical landmarks are confusing. Anatomical variability of the course of this nerves and distributiona of the sensory innervated skin area are very high. US helps in needle visualisation and makes anatomy more predictable.[4] In trunk pain US helps to visualise ribs, pleura, muscle layers. US makes the block easier and safer. In other sitution as pudendal neuralgia diagnosis is primarily a clinical one, confirmed by a diagnostic block. Tha interligamentous plane is the key to local anesthetic placement. US helps in real time visualisation of needle placement and confirmation of an injectate sperad within the interlegamentous plane. Almost 100% block success has been achieved by this technique and by identifyng pudendal artery and depositing local anesthetic solution media to the artery[5] US was considered a standard tool also for musculoskeletal pain. All joint injection can better performed under US guidance.[6] Ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve stimulation avoids the invasiveness of electrode placement via an open procedure while providing excellent pain relief. There are limitations of the percutaneous approach when navigating close to large blood vessels, a situation more appropriately managed with open peripheral nerve stimulator placement. Ultrasound-guided placement may be considered for patients receiving peripheral nerve stimulators placed within the deep tissues, and not easily placed in a blind fashion.[7] Conclusion(s): US systems are more available and cheap these days. Transportable devices give high resolution and quality pictures. This device is available in almost every hospital. Potential advantages of ultrasound are: no hazard of radiation exposure, it could be done in every position, visualization of nerves and surrounding structures: vessels, muscles, bone and visceral pleura, lung, peritoneum, bowel, diagnostic recognizing anatomical variability and pathology real time image of needle, needle nerve contact and inject it spread, reduce complication: nerve injury, vessels puncture, pneumothorax etc., higher success rate, quicker onset, reduces performance time, reduce volume of local anesthetic. A problem with the application of ultrasound in chronic pain interventions is that randomised controlled trials may not be ethical while comparing to fluoroscopy or CT. Wide world use of ultrasound guidance into clinical practice has to come as its use a tool, from clinical outcome studies. Its further development will depends on training and education.

Purpose: [<sup>11</sup>C]Cimbi-36 was recently developed as an agonist radioligand for brain imaging of serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT<inf>2A</inf>) with positron emission tomography (PET). This may be used to quantify the high-affinity state of 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptors and may have the potential to quantify changes in cerebral 5-HT levels in vivo. We here investigated safety aspects related to clinical use of [<sup>11</sup>C]Cimbi-36, including radiation dosimetry and in vivo pharmacology. Procedures: [<sup>11</sup>C]Cimbi-36 was injected in rats or pigs, and radiation dosimetry was examined by ex vivo dissection or with PET scanning, respectively. Based on animal data, the Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment software was used to estimate extrapolated human dosimetry for [<sup>11</sup>C]Cimbi-36. The 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptor agonist actions of [<sup>11</sup>C]Cimbi-36 in vivo pharmacological effects in mice elicited by increasing doses of Cimbi-36 were assessed with the head-twitch response (HTR). Result(s): The effective dose as extrapolated from both rat and pig data was low, 7.67 and 4.88 muSv/MBq, respectively. In addition, the estimated absorbed radiation dose to human target organs did not exceed safety levels. Administration of 0.5 mg/kg Cimbi-36 leads to significant HTR compared to saline, whereas 0.05 mg/kg Cimbi-36 (doses much larger than those given in conjunction with a PET scan) did not elicit a significant HTR. Conclusion(s): Administration of tracer doses of [<sup>11</sup>C]Cimbi-36 does not seem to be associated with unusual radiation burden or adverse clinical effects. © 2013 World Molecular Imaging Society.",Excluded
614,"Brain stereotactic radiosurgery planning using the single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique. Purpose/Objective(s): Brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment using a single isocenter for treating multiple metastases can save treatment time but poses a challenge to SRS planning using the dynamic-arc technique. The objective of this study is to develop a strategy for SRS planning using the single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique. We hypothesize that the single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique can produce satisfactory SRS plans for treating multiple targets and save treatment time. Materials/Methods: We have developed a planning strategy for singleisocenter dynamic-arc technique and used it clinically since February 2015. In this technique, the targets are first split into small batches so that all targets in a batch are within 5 cm of each other. The center of gravity of all targets in a batch is the isocenter, with which multiple treatment groups are associated. Each treatment group typically consists of 3 dynamic-arc beams to irradiate 1-3 targets. For each arc, the collimator angle is adjusted to minimize the ""island"" between targets that cannot be blocked with the multileaf collimators (MLCs). Each treatment group is normalized so that the maximal dose is 125% of the prescription dose. If the maximal dose to a target is less than 123%, an additional arc is used to boost the maximal dose of that target to 125%. To evaluate the plan quality we randomly selected 5 cases planned with this technique. There were totally 21 planning target volumes (PTVs), and 13 isocenters were used to treat all these targets. We replanned them using multiple isocenters, 1 isocenter for each target. The prescription for each target was 20 Gy with a maximal dose of 25 Gy, which was equivalent to 20 Gy to 80% isodose line. Plan quality indexes including PTV coverage, mean dose, V12Gy, conformity index (CI), and V50%/VPTV were compared. Result(s): Satisfactory PTV coverage (V100%Z95% and V95%Z100%) were achieved for all plans using either technique. Most PTVs have a maximal dose between 24.9 and 25.1 Gy, with 2 PTV between 24.5 and 24.9 Gy. The ratios of mean dose and CI between the single- and multiple-isocenter techniques were respectively 1.05+/-0.035 and 1.06+/-0.0, indicating similar plan quality globally and in the high dose area. The difference was more pronounced for the mid-to-low dose spillage with the ratios of V12Gy and V50%/VPTV being 1.12+/-0.055 and 1.14+/-0.045, respectively. Overall, the plan quality was slightly better for the multi-isocenter technique because the single-isocenter technique uses MLCs instead of jaws to block the radiation between targets and thus has a higher leakage dose. The treatment time was reduced by 30%-50% with the single-isocenter technique. Conclusion(s): The single-isocenter dynamic-arc technique can produce satisfactory SRS plans for treating multiple targets and can significantly reduce the treatment time. This time saving can be further improved using a larger allowable distance between targets. However, this tactic might worsen the rotational error to an unacceptable level.",Excluded
162,"Phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin alters chaperone function through loss of dimeric substructure. Phosphorylation is the most common posttranslational modification of the alpha-crystallins in the human lens. These phosphorylated forms are not only important because of their abundance in aging lenses and the implications for cataract but also because they have been identified in patients with degenerative brain disease. By using mimics corresponding to the reported in vivo phosphorylation sites in the human lens, we have examined the effects of phosphorylation upon the chaperone-like properties and structure of alphaB-crystallin. Here we show that phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin at Ser-45 results in uncontrolled aggregation. By using an innovative tandem mass spectrometry approach, we demonstrate how this alteration in behavior stems from disruption of dimeric substructure within the polydisperse alphaB-crystallin assembly. This structural perturbation appears to disturb the housekeeping role of alphaB-crystallin and consequently has important implications for the disease states caused by protein aggregation in the lens and deposition in non-lenticular tissue.",Excluded
704,"Cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment of atypical (Who Grade II) cranial meningiomas. []. BACKGROUND: The optimal management of subtotally resected atypical meningiomas is unknown. OBJECTIVE(S): To perform a retrospective review of patients with residual or recurrent atypical meningiomas treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHOD(S): Twenty-five patients were treated, either immediately after surgery (n = 15) or at the time of radiographic progression or treatment failure (n = 10). SRS was delivered to with a median marginal dose of 22 Gy (range, 16-30) in 1 to 4 fractions (median, 1), targeting a median tumor volume of 5.3 cm (range, 0.3-26.0). RESULT(S): With a median follow-up time of 28 months (range, 3-67), the 12-, 24-, and 36-month actuarial local and regional control rates for all patients were 94%, 94%, 74%, and 90%, 90%, 62%, respectively. There were 2 cases of radiation toxicity. On univariate analysis, the number of recurrences before SRS (P = .046), late SRS (ie, waiting until tumor progression to initiate treatment) (P = .03), and age at treatment >=60 years (P = .01) were significant predictors of recurrence. Of the 20 radiation-naive patients, 2 patients failed with the targeted lesion and 3 elsewhere in the resection bed, resulting in 12-, 24- and 36-month actuarial local and regional control rates of 100%, 100%, 73% and 93%, 93%, 75%, respectively. The overall locoregional control rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 93%, 93%, and 54%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Irradiation of the entire postoperative tumor bed may not be necessary for the majority of patients with subtotally resected atypical meningiomas. Patients in this series achieved outcomes comparable to that of historical control rates for larger volume, conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.",Excluded

917,"The Association of Socioeconomic Status with the Burden of Cataract-related Blindness and the Effect of Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure: An Ecological Study. Objective: To assess the association of socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract blindness in terms of year lived with disability (YLD) rates and to determine whether ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels modify the effect of socioeconomic status on this health burden.Methods: National and subnational age-standardized YLD rates associated with cataract-related blindness were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017. The human development index (HDI) from the Human Development Report was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. Estimated ground-level UVR exposure was obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) dataset of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).Results: Across 185 countries, socioeconomic status was inversely associated with the burden of cataract blindness. Countries with a very high HDI had an 84% lower age-standardized YLD rate [95% confidence interval ( CI): 60%-93%, P < 0.001] than countries with a low HDI; for high-HDI countries, the proportion was 76% (95% CI: 53%-88%, P < 0.001), and for medium-HDI countries, the proportion was 48% (95% CI: 15%-68%, P = 0.010; P for trend < 0.001). The interaction analysis showed that UVR exposure played an interactive role in the association between socioeconomic status and cataract blindness burden ( P value for interaction = 0.047).Conclusion: Long-term high-UVR exposure amplifies the association of poor socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract-related blindness. The findings emphasize the need for strengthening UVR exposure protection interventions in developing countries with high-UVR exposure.",Excluded
784,"Dose-dependent white matter damage after brain radiotherapy. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain radiotherapy is limited in part by damage to white matter, contributing to neurocognitive decline. We utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with multiple b-values (diffusion weightings) to model the dose-dependency and time course of radiation effects on white matter.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with high-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy underwent MRI with DTI prior to radiotherapy, and after months 1, 4-6, and 9-11. Diffusion tensors were calculated using three weightings (high, standard, and low b-values) and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>), and radial diffusivity (lambda<sub></sub>) were generated. The region of interest was all white matter.RESULTS: MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> increased significantly with time and dose, with corresponding decrease in FA. Greater changes were seen at lower b-values, except for FA. Time-dose interactions were highly significant at 4-6months and beyond (p<.001), and the difference in dose response between high and low b-values reached statistical significance at 9-11months for MD, lambda<sub></sub>, and lambda<sub></sub> (p<.001, p<.001, p=.005 respectively) as well as at 4-6months for lambda<sub></sub> (p=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We detected dose-dependent changes across all doses, even <10Gy. Greater changes were observed at low b-values, suggesting prominent extracellular changes possibly due to vascular permeability and neuroinflammation.",Excluded

655,"Strong resetting of the mammalian clock by constant light followed by constant darkness. The mammalian molecular circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) regulates locomotor activity rhythms as well as clocks in peripheral tissues (Reppert and Weaver, 2002; Ko and Takahashi, 2006). Constant light (LL) can induce behavioral and physiological arrhythmicity by desynchronizing clock cells in the SCN (Ohta et al., 2005). We examined how the disordered clock cells resynchronize by probing the molecular clock and measuring behavior in mice transferred from LL to constant darkness (DD). The circadian locomotor activity rhythms disrupted in LL become robustly rhythmic again from the beginning of DD, and the starting phase of the rhythm in DD is specific, not random, suggesting that the desynchronized clock cells are quickly reset in an unconventional manner by the L/D transition. By measuring mPERIOD protein rhythms, we showed that the SCN and peripheral tissue clocks quickly become rhythmic again in phase with the behavioral rhythms. We propose that this resetting mechanism may be different from conventional phase shifting, which involves light induction of Period genes (Albrecht et al., 1997; Shearman et al., 1997; Shigeyoshi et al., 1997). Using our functional insights, we could shift the circadian phase of locomotor activity rhythms by 12 h using a 15 h LL treatment: essentially producing phase reversal by a single light pulse, a feat that has not been reported previously in wild-type mice and that has potential clinical utility.",Excluded
17,"AMPA silencing is a prerequisite for developmental long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region. AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) unsilencing is an often proposed expression mechanism both for developmental long-term potentiation (LTP), involved in circuitry refinement during brain development, and for mature LTP, involved in learning and memory. In the hippocampal CA3-CA1 connection naive (nonstimulated) synapses are AMPA signaling and AMPA-silent synapses are created from naive AMPA-signaling (AMPA-labile) synapses by test-pulse synaptic activation (AMPA silencing). To investigate to what extent LTPs at different developmental stages are explained by AMPA unsilencing, the amount of LTP obtained at these different developmental stages was related to the amount of AMPA silencing that preceded the induction of LTP. When examined in the second postnatal week Hebbian induction was found to produce no more stable potentiation than that causing a return to the naive synaptic strength existing prior to the AMPA silencing. Moreover, in the absence of a preceding AMPA silencing Hebbian induction produced no stable potentiation above the naive synaptic strength. Thus this early, or developmental, LTP is nothing more than an unsilencing (dedepression) and stabilization of the AMPA signaling that was lost by the prior AMPA silencing. This dedepression and stabilization of AMPA signaling was mimicked by the presence of the protein kinase A activator forskolin. As the relative degree of AMPA silencing decreased with development, LTP manifested itself more and more as a ""genuine"" potentiation (as opposed to a dedepression) not explained by unsilencing and stabilization of AMPA-labile synapses. This ""genuine,"" or mature, LTP rose from close to nothing of total LTP prior to postnatal day (P)13, to about 70% of total LTP at P16, and to about 90% of total LTP at P30. Developmental LTP, by stabilization of AMPA-labile synapses, thus seems adapted to select synaptic connections to the growing synaptic network. Mature LTP, by instead strengthening existing stable connections between cells, may then create functionally tightly connected cell assemblies within this network.",Excluded
211,"Magnetic fields alter electrical properties of solutions and their physiological effects. Calcium chloride and snail physiological salt solutions were exposed to static magnetic fields (2.3-350 mT), and the physical properties of the solutions as well as their biologic effects were studied. Our preliminary observations show that these fields alter physicochemical properties of CaCl2 solutions and the functional effects of physiological solutions. Experiments on CaCl2 solutions demonstrated field-dependent changes of electrical conductivity, with the magnitude and the direction of conductivity change being a function of both concentration and field intensity. The changes in conductivity were maintained for periods in excess of 1 h after exposure. Conductivity changes were not found after exposure of physiological solutions to static magnetic fields, but changes of biological consequence did occur. Other experiments showed that there were several changes in cellular function observed in ganglia and isolated neurons of Helix pomatia when the perfusing medium was changed from the normal physiologic solution to the same solution after exposure to magnetic fields. These changes include membrane depolarization and increased action potential discharge, reduced uptake of Ca into cells, altered content of cyclic nucleotides in ganglia, and increased volume of isolated cell bodies. A change in hydration of calcium ions may be one of the consequences of magnetic-field exposure, and in physiological solutions this change may have functional consequences.",Excluded

Dielectric properties of the brain, muscle, and bone materials were similar to those of human tissues at 64 MHz. The body consisted of homogeneous phantom muscle enclosed in a human-shaped fiberglass shell. Thermographic and fiber-optic temperature measurements were conducted to reveal any heating. Thermograms of sagittal, frontal, and horizontal planes of the head with the ABI and CI electrodes were taken immediately before and after a 26 min MRI scan. The MRI sequence was set at 94 excitations and 25 ms echo time to induce maximum radiofrequency heating, as suggested by the General Electric Company. The difference of these two thermograms gives the heating results. In two uncut phantom heads.

31,"Potential role of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of tumors of the maxillary sinus. Purpose: To assess 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques to see whether doses to critical structures could be reduced while maintaining planning target volume (PTV) coverage in patients receiving conventional radiotherapy (RT) for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus because of the risk of radiation-induced complications, particularly visual loss. Methods and Materials: Six patients who had recently received conventional RT for carcinoma of the maxillary sinus were studied. Conventional RT, 3D-CRT, and step-and-shoot IMRT plans were prepared using the same 2-field arrangement. The effect of reducing the number of segments in the IMRT beams was investigated. Result(s): 3D-CRT and IMRT reduced the brain and ipsilateral parotid gland doses compared with the conventional plans. IMRT reduced doses to both optic nerves; for the contralateral optic nerve, 15-segment IMRT plans delivered an average maximal dose of 56.4 Gy (range 53.9-59.3) compared with 65.7 Gy (range 65.3-65.9) and 64.2 Gy (range 61.4-65.6) for conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. IMRT also gave improved PTV homogeneity and improved coverage, with an average of 8.5% (range 7.0-11.7%) of the volume receiving <95% of the prescription dose (64 Gy) compared with 14.7% (range 14.1-15.9%) and 15.1% (range 14.4-16.1%) with conventional RT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Little difference was found between the 15 and 7-segment plans, but 5 segments resulted in a reduced minimal PTV dose. Conclusion(s): IMRT offers significant advantages over conventional RT and 3D-CRT techniques for treatment of maxillary sinus tumors. Good results can be obtained from 7 segments per beam without compromising the PTV coverage. This number of segments is practical for implementation in a busy RT department. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

Relative risk (RR) of ischemic stroke was determined by comparison with population rates from a stroke-incidence register, adjusted for sex and age. Other risk factors for stroke (hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus [DM]) were registered. The median follow-up time after RT was 7.7 years (3,011 person-years of follow-up).RESULTS: Fourteen cases of stroke occurred (expected, 2.5; RR, 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1 to 9.4): eight in patients with laryngeal carcinoma (expected,1.56; RR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 10.1), four in pleomorphic adenoma patients (expected, 0.71; RR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 14.5), and two in parotid carcinoma patients (expected, 0.24; RR, 8.5, 95% CI, 1.0 to 30.6). Five of six strokes in patients irradiated for a parotid tumor occurred at the ipsilateral side. Analysis of other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease showed hypertension and DM to cause an increase of the RR after RT. After more than 10 years' follow-up, the RR was 10.1 (95% CI, 4.4 to 20.0). The 15-year cumulative risk of stroke after RT on the neck was 12.0% (95% CI, 6.5% to 21.4%).CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate an increased risk of stroke after RT on the neck.

Material(s) and Method(s): Medical records were reviewed and clinical data collected on AT/RT in a 6 year period (2006-12). Histopathology slides were reviewed and relevant immunohistochemistry stains were done. Overall survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis of factors predictive of overall survival was done by Log Rank test. Result(s): 15 patients met the study criterion (male: female=4:1). Median age at presentation was 5 years (range 0.8-8 years). Presenting complaints included vomiting (73.33%), headache (46.67%), orbital symptoms (33.33%), motor impairment (26.67%), gait abnormality (20%) and seizure (20%). Median duration of symptoms was noted to be 2 months (range 0.5-6 months). On contrast enhanced MRI of brain, tumour location was supratentorial in 60% patients and infratentorial in 40% patients. Cystic component and hydrocephalus were noted in 73.33% patients each whereas contrast enhancement and calcification were discerned in 53.33% and 40% of the patients respectively. All patients underwent tumour resection - gross total (26.67%), neartotal (13.33%) and subtotal (60%). Histopathology was confirmative of AT/RT with MIB-1 labelling index varying from 11-85% (median 45%). There was lack of immunostaining for INI-1 suggesting INI-1 mutation. Majority of tumours exhibited immunopositivity for EMA (93.33%), synaptophysin (80%), cytokeratin (66.67%), vimentin (66.7%), SMA (60%), GFAP (46.67%). Adjuvant radiation (36 Gy/20#/4 weeks to entire neuraxis followed by local boost 20 Gy/10#/2 weeks) was started in 6 patients (40%) and completed in 5 patients. Young age at presentation and poor performance status precluded the use of radiation in the remainder. Systemic chemotherapy was administered in 10 (66.67%) patients. Median number of cycles given was 3 (range 1-12) with ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and VAC (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide) being the common regimens (26.67% and 20% respectively). After a median follow-up of 8.33 months (mean-12.27 months), median overall survival was noted to be 10 months. At last follow-up, 2 patients are in complete response, 1 patient is on treatment, 3 patients are alive with evidence of disease and 9 patients expired due to disease progression. The 1 and 2 year actuarial rate of overall survival was noted to be 48.1% and 24.1% respectively. On univariate analysis, extent of surgery (p = 0.0149), use of craniospinal radiation (p = 0.0087) and MIB-1 labelling index (p = 0.0034) were significant predictors of overall survival while age (>=5 years versus <5 years) was of borderline significance (p = 0.08).

328,"Measurement of cerebral ventricular sizes and parenchymal abnormalities on bedside by ultrasound sonography in patients with craniectomy: Comparison with CCT. Introduction: In patients with craniectomy ventricular size and parenchymal abnormalities are reliably estimated by CCT or MRI. Both techniques are time consuming; CCT involves frequent radiation exposure. Measurement of ventricular sizes or parenchymal abnormalities by ultrasound sonography is rarely performed. Aim of the study: To compare data of measurements of the ventricular size and anatomic structures by ultrasound sonography and CCT in patients (n = 62) with craniectomy following traumatic or vascular accidents. Method(s): Transcranial Duplex sonography (Hitachi-EUB 5000+C; 5-2/Abdominal probe; 1.4 MHz) over the craniectomized hemisphere. Documentation of land marks such as alteration of parenchymal structure, extravascular blood accumulation, hygroma, ventricular diameter, midline shift. Data of ventricular diameter were correlated with measurements obtained by CCT. Result(s): Sonography of the brain's structures and vessels by ultrasound sonography provide sharp outlined pictures which can be compared to CCT imaging with high reliability. Aneurysms larger than 10 mm in diameter were identified in some cases. The correlation of the diameter of the ventricles of the craniectomized and the contralateral side between ultrasound measurement and CCT was high (correlation coeffizient 0.826 for the first and 0.959 for subsequent measurements). In repetitive studies of the ultrasound measurements over a few days (without repetitive CCT), the stability of the diameter was high. Alteration of the horizontal body position between zero and 45 degrees did not affect the diameter of the ventricles. Midline shifts were detected with high reliability. Quantitative measurement of the blood flow velocity in the large intracerebral vessels using the Doppler modus was possible. Summary: B-mode ultrasound measurements of the ventricular size, the parenchyma and of the blood flow velocity in patients with craniectomy deliver reliable quantitative results for clinical neurosurgical and neurological decisions and may economize indication for frequent CCT.",Excluded
973,"The ability of low level laser therapy to prevent muscle tissue damage induced by snake venom. Antivenom therapy has been ineffective in neutralizing the severe local fast developing tissue damage following snakebite envenoming. Herein, some effects of in situ helium neon (HeNe) laser irradiation on rat nerve-muscle preparation injected with Bothrops jararacussu venom are described. The tibialis anterior muscle was injected with venom diluted in 0.9% saline solution (60 microg/0.02 mL) or saline solution alone. Sixty minutes after venom injection, laser (HeNe) treatment was administered at three incident energy densities: dose 1, a single exposure of 3.5 J cm(-2); dose 2, three exposures of 3.5 J cm(-2); dose 3, a single exposure of 10.5 J cm(-2). Muscle function was assessed through twitch tension recordings whereas muscle damage was evaluated through histopathologic analysis, morphometry of area of tissue affected and creatine kinase (CK) serum levels, and compared to unirradiated muscles. Laser application at the dose of 3.5 J cm(-2) reduced the area of injury by 64% (15.9 +/- 1.5%vs 44.2 +/- 5.7%), decreased the neuromuscular blockade (NMB) by 62% (11.5 +/- 2.5%vs 30.4 +/- 5.2%) and reduced CK levels by 58% (from 455 +/- 4.5% to 190.3 +/- 23.4%) when compared with unirradiated controls. Dose 2 showed a poorer benefit than dose 1, and dose 3 was ineffective in preventing the venom effects. Measurements of the absorbance of unirradiated and irradiated venom solution showed no difference in absorption spectra. In addition, no difference in the intensity of partial NMB in nerve-muscle preparation was shown by unirradiated and irradiated venom. The results indicate that the laser light did not alter venom toxicity. We conclude that HeNe laser irradiation at a dosage of 3.5 J cm(-2) effectively reduces myonecrosis and the neuromuscular transmission blocking effect caused by B. jararacussu snake venom. Thus, low level laser therapy may be a promising tool to minimize the severity of some of the local effects of snake envenoming.",Excluded

The patients were RPA (recursive partitioning analysis) class I, II, and III in 11.2%, 69.6%, and 18.4% of the cases, respectively; RPA class II-a, II-b, and II-c in 8.3%, 24.8%, and 66.9% of the cases, respectively; and with GPA (graded prognostic assessment) scores of 0-1.0, 1.5-2.0, 2.5-3.0, and 3.5-4.0 in 35%, 27.5%, 18.2%, and 8.6% of the cases, respectively.RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) times according to RPA class I, II, and III were 20.1, 5.1, and 1.3 months, respectively (P<.0001); according to RPA class II-a, II-b, II-c: 9.1, 8.9, and 4.0 months, respectively (P<.0001); and according to GPA score 0-1.0, 1.5-2.0, 2.5-3.0, and 3.5-4.0: 2.5, 4.4, 9.0, and 19.1 months, respectively (P<.0001). By multivariate analysis, the favorable independent prognostic factors for survival were as follows: for gastrointestinal tumor, a high Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (P=.0003) and an absence of extracranial metastases (ECM) (P=.003); for kidney cancer, few BM (P=.002); for melanoma, few BM (P=.01), an absence of ECM (P=.002), and few ECM (P=.0002); for lung cancer, age (P=.007), a high KPS (P<.0001), an absence of ECM (P<.0001), few ECM and BM (P<.0001 and P=.0006, respectively), and control of the primary tumor (P=.004); and for breast cancer, age (P=.001), a high KPS (P=.007), control of the primary tumor (P=.05), and few ECM and BM (P=.01 and P=.0002, respectively). The triple-negative subtype was a significant unfavorable factor (P=.007).CONCLUSION: Prognostic factors varied by pathology. Our analysis confirms the strength of prognostic factors used to determine the GPA score, including the genetic subtype for breast cancer.",Excluded

Background: Patients with malignant glioma are usually managed in neurosurgical tertiary referral centres, however 30% return to their regional/ rural location for ongoing care. This study explored levels of communication, education and the needs of patients and doctors. Method(s): A survey was designed, targeting regional/rural oncologists, general practitioners (GPs) and patients with malignant glioma. The survey was funded by a Western and Central Melbourne Integrated Cancer Service (WCMICS) grant. Questions to doctors included: adequacy of referral information, access to services and areas they would like to improve knowledge skills. Patient questions included: information provided at diagnosis, ability to access medical services and improved clinical support. Result(s): The overall response rate was 49% (8 oncologists, 30 GPs, 9 patients). 70% of GPs felt the information received from the hospital was 'adequate' or 'excellent'. Doctors sought: improved communication and support regarding clinical decision making (multi-disciplinary care), education regarding the use of dexamethasone, antiepileptics, novel therapies and recommendations regarding driving. 37% of GPs had 'low': confidence in managing patients with malignant gliomas. 78% of patients felt they were provided 'enough' information at diagnosis. The three most comprehensive information sources for patients were their surgeon, medical oncologist and radiation oncologist. 56% of patients requested improved carer support and 67% would seek initial assistance from their GP for any issue related to their brain tumour. Conclusion(s): While communication between the tertiary hospital and regional/rural centres is occurring consistently, we have identified a number of areas where clinical care can be improved. An action plan is being developed to address educational needs for regional/rural doctors, and additional information provision for patients and their carers.",Excluded

70,"Continuous intrathecal bupivacaine and opioid infusion for the treatment of chronic stage IV liposarcoma cancer pain and diffuse spinal metastasis. Introduction We present a 58yo male with stage IV liposarcoma and diffuse cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine metastasis. Patient described severe cancer bone pain, especially troublesome in the low back. His cancer was diagnosed in 2014 and the tumor was initially resected from the posterior thigh. Bone metastasis was later noted in 2015, and later that year he developed a pathological fracture of the femur which left him bedridden. While hospitalized he developed a DVT and PE. He was started on chemotherapy and radiation, which continued to weaken and exacerbate his back pain. In addition, he suffered from right sided blindness and deafness, metastasis to the lung, HTN and depression which continued to decrease his quality of life. Results/Case report In the context of the patient's diffuse metastasis, we considered his pain secondary to metastatic cancer to the spine. The patient described the majority of the pain to be located in the low levels of his back, and characterized the pain as achy, throbbing, without radiation and exacerbated with exertion. Prior to any interventional therapy, the patient underwent conservative management with oral, intravenous, and topical agents all which did not provide any pain relief. At this point, we discussed the benefits of placement of a neuroaxial catheter, and the patient was amendable. Our preference was placement of a tunneled epidural catheter for outpatient infusion, but we were unsuccessful in securing a long-term care facility to accept care for the epidural and its dressing changes. This would have been a more cost effective option, and one that would not require invasive surgery. Since this was not possible, we discussed the possibility of intrathecal pump placement, and this was successfully implanted as a culmination of past therapies. After pump implantation, the patient was started on intrathecal morphine at 2mg/day which did not provide sufficient pain control. The morphine dose was increased to 3mg/day, plus an assist device of 0.2mg Q4hrs. Even at 4.2mg/day intrathecal morphine, equivalent to 420mg of IV morphine and >1200mg PO morphine, opioids alone were still not providing adequate pain relief. At this point, we considered the option of adding intrathecal Bupivacaine to the infusion. The patient was already bedridden and lower extremity motor weakness was not a significant factor. We slowly titrated the Bupivacaine infusion to effect. It was not until we reached 6mg/day of 2% continuous intrathecal Bupivacaine, in addition to 0.6mg Q4hrs assist device (which brought the cumulative dose to 9.4mg/day intrathecal Bupivacaine) that the patient began to experience pain relief. Discussion Intrathecal pump is a reliable therapy for chronic pain. Bupivacaine, used in combination with opioids, is a helpful and safe method of treatment for patients who have not responded to intrathecal opioids alone. In our case, even at an unusual and extraordinary large dose of Bupivacaine and opioid combination, the patient maintained normal BP, HR and respiratory status. This treatment option may improve quality of life while providing pain relief for patients with cancer pain and already limited functional status.",Excluded
938,"A simple way to diagnose myeloma with free light chains (FLC) Freelite assay. Background: Plasma cell disorders are characterized by uncontrollable production of the same immunoglobulin, complete or not, from a proliferating plasma cells clone. The risk factors for the disorders are: being middle aged, being male and exposed to chemical compounds or radiation. Plasma cell dyscrasias are classified into Myeloma, MGUS, Macroglobulinemia and Heavy Chain Disease. We want to show the uselfuness and importance of Freelite Assay for Myeloma diagnosis. Methods and Results: S.G., a 65-year-old man, was hospitalized in San Giuseppe Moscati Hospital to undergo an operation to his inguinal hernia. He had only a feeble pain at the abdomen, increasing with deambulation. Laboratory tests, performed before the surgery, didn't report important alterations. Haematological parameters had little variations compared to average values and reported a slight pancytopenia (RBC=3,7x106/muL, Plt=129x103/muL, WBC =3,8x103/muL) and a slight macrocytic and hyperchromic anemia (Hct=38,6%, MCV=104fL, MCH=36,1 pg). Calcemia was normal (9,1 mg/dL), serum protein electrophoresis showed a little hypogammaglobulinemia and a little thickening-band before gamma globulins. We measured FLC in S.G serum using Freelite Assay and unexpectedly it reported high levels of kappa free-chains (177 mg/dL) and a kappa/lambda ratio of 17,4. This data were then confirmed by other methods. Serum immunosubtraction identified a signal breakdown of thickeningband from kappa anti-serum in pre-gamma position. Then, we measured k and W chains in urine by nephelometry and performed urine electrophoresis. Nephelometry identified a massive excretion of kappa chains (kappa/lambda urinary ratio = 140) , urinary electrophoresis identified a strong band of immunoglobulins in pre-gamma position and an intermediate excretion of albumin. For the diagnosis of Myeloma we waited for the results of NMR, X-ray and bone marrow biopsy. X-ray reported radiolucency areas only in the cranial theca and NMR reported diploic hyperintense nuclei in L1 on the right side and in L2 on the right peduncle. Conclusion(s): Bioptic test of bone marrow, taken from iliac crest, allowed the identification of a conspicuous plasmocytosis (30%) and confirmed Myeloma diagnosis, which was previously and correctly formulated through FLC laboratory data.",Excluded
118,"The physical basis of neuroimaging techniques. During the past 20 years, the technology of neuroimaging has improved on all fronts. Coupled with increased human ingenuity and the greater power of digital computers, modern imaging methods are capable of providing precise measurements of brain structure and sensitive assessments of brain function. The complementary nature of different techniques adds to their value, whereas the rivalry between modalities continues to catalyze the pace of technical advances. Although there may appear to be choices to be made as to which technique should be used for certain purposes, in many instances there are clear advantages and reasons to select a particular method. Some of these advantages were mentioned in this article, but here we summarize some of the relevant issues. Nuclear medicine techniques have almost no role in anatomic imaging because they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot hi general distinguish many types of tissues to permit structural analysis. Although CT provides excellent images of the skull, sulci, and ventricles, and is capable of providing volumetric and dynamic images with recent advances such as spiral scanning, it is unlikely in the future to challenge MR imaging for structural studies. CT exposes the patient to ionizing radiation and at acceptable doses cannot provide the soft-tissue differentiation needed for must structural studies. MR imaging systems based on magnets of moderate to high field strength provide images with contrast and spatial resolution superior to those of any other imaging method. In the foreseeable future, there appears to be no other imaging technique capable of providing the quality of anatomic information rendered by MR imaging. Furthermore, it is clear that continuing advances in MR imaging technology, such as the development of new magnets and improved RF coils, will lead to further improvements in image quality beyond that obtainable today, most likely at lower costs than previous systems. In addition, the development of higher field strength systems (operating at 3-5 T) will provide information at a spatial scale not previously available except in specialized animal imaging systems, so that in vivo resolution of 100 mum will be possible in many centers. One primary challenge will be to develop computer image analysis techniques capable of handling the wealth of anatomic detail provided by MR imaging in reasonable times and at reasonable cost. Functional methods will continue to evolve. Functional MR imaging is less than 4 years old but has already progressed to the point where it can provide data in some studies to rival the best available by other means. Questions regarding the superiority of functional MR imaging or PET, however, cannot be conclusively addressed now, and in fact may not be sensible; both will remain important for the next several years. There are realistic expectations that functional MR imaging will yield semi-quantitative measures of flow and oxygenation in individual subjects in a large number of cognitive and other tasks, and using functional MR imaging we should learn a great deal about the distribution and connectedness of neural systems involved with different functions. The major challenges will be in designing interpretable studies that lend themselves to the functional MR imaging format and in improving the reliability of the functional MR imaging data. Higher field magnets, providing images with higher SNR as well as being more sensitive to microscopic susceptibility effects, should increase the sensitivity of functional MR imaging. The ability to perform multiple repeated studies on individuals and its intrinsic safety, coupled with its high spatial resolution, assures it of an evolving role in the study of brain activation. PET will also continue to be used for many such activation studies. PET facilities uniquely can perform studies of organic disorders such as tumors, receptor systems, and metabolism. PET enjoys high sensitivity to activation and, in the right hands, can provide absolute quantification of flow changes as wel as resting flow, a task currently beyond functional MR imaging BOLD methods. Some improvements in spatial resolution and sensitivity can be expected from different detector systems.",Excluded

888,"X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of two-component heterokaryons of Neurospora crassa. VIII. Dose-dependence of the overall spectrum. There is considerable controversy in the literature concerning the nature of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in various experimental organisms. To investigate this problem in Neurospora crassa a series of experiments (Webber and de Serres, 1965) was performed to study the induction-kinetics of X-ray-induced mutation in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region of a two-component heterokaryon (H-12). Subsequent genetic analyses (de Serres, 1989a,b,c, 1990a), on a series of 832 mutants recovered in these experiments, have shown that 3 different classes of ad-3 mutants were recovered, namely gene/point mutations, multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations. Complementation studies with a series of genetic markers that define 21 genetic loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent genetic regions have shown that ad-3 mutants classified as multilocus deletions result from the inactivation of a series of loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions of Linkage Group I, whereas multiple-locus mutations result from combinations of gene/point mutations and multilocus deletions. Analysis of the induction kinetics of these 3 different classes, after completion of the genetic characterization of all mutants (de Serres, 1990b) demonstrated that gene/point mutations increase linearly with X-ray dose, whereas multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations increase as the square of X-ray dose. Further analysis of allelic complementation among the gene/point mutations at the ad-3B locus (de Serres, 1990c), demonstrated that the spectrum of complementation patterns was dose-dependent: complementing mutants with nonpolarized patterns decreased and noncomplementing mutations increased with increasing X-ray dose. There was little or no change with dose in the frequency of mutants with polarized patterns. In the present report, data from studies published previously have been utilized, along with additional data from the original X-ray experiments (12-5, 12-6, 12-7, and 12-10; see Webber and de Serres, 1965) to develop composite complementation maps of the X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions as a function of X-ray dose. This analysis of the overall spectrum of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region demonstrated marked dose-dependence and provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature with regard to specific-locus studies in different experimental organisms.",Excluded

Combined chemotherapy/radiotherapy treatments appear to yield better results in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) than radiotherapy alone. The optimal induction chemotherapy regimen remains to be established. In the present study, chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine was used prior to radical radiotherapy in Stage III-B NSCLC. Thirty-three patients were entered prospectively into a Phase II study. Treatment consisted of three cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1 and vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, followed by thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy). Twenty-two percent of the 33 patients had grade 3-4 leukopenia, and there were six episodes (in 4 patients) of neutropenia-associated fever. Gastrointestinal toxicity was generally moderate. Peripheral neuropathy was present in 42% of the patients, although in most of them it was slight. The main radiotherapy toxicity was esophagitis grade I-II. Evaluation of response after the third chemotherapy course showed an objective response in 16 patients (48%), whereas in three patients (9%) the disease progressed during therapy. The median survival of the entire group was 13 months.

485,"Impaired Attentional Set-Shifting Performance after Exposure to 5 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si Particles. Astronauts on deep space missions will be required to work more autonomously than on previous missions, and thus their ability to perform executive functions could be critical to mission success. One of the most common measures of executive function in humans is the ability to perform attentional set shifting, which requires contributions from working memory, discrimination, reversal learning, attentional set shifting and attention. Rodent attentional set shifting assays require rats to form an association between the presence of the food reward and an associative cue, which is either the digging media or the scent that is placed in the bowl; by altering the combination of scent and digging media, progressively more complex cognitive processes can be tested. In this study, we have determined the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si particles has on the ability of male retired breeder Wistar rats to perform attentional set shifting at three months postirradiation. All doses of Si resulted in a significant impairment in the ability of the rats to perform the first and most simple step of the ATSET assay, the simple discrimination (SD) task. If astronauts were to experience HZE-induced SD impairments, they would be unable to identify key factors to successfully resolve a situation. Performance in at least one other component of the ATSET test was impaired at all doses studied, however, these varied according to the dose. Compared with our previous studies using 1 GeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe and <sup>48</sup>Ti particles, 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si ions impaired attentional set-shifting performance at lower doses than the heavier ions. However, when the effect of isofluences of the three HZE ions were compared, there were no significant differences in the severity of the impaired performance; there were, however, ion-specific decrements in the ability of rats to perform within the various stages of the test. This study further supports the notion that ""mission-relevant"" doses of HZE particles (<20 cGy) can impair certain aspects of attentional set-shifting performance in retired breeder rats, but there may be some ion-specific changes in the specific cognitive domains impaired.",Included
1144,"Decrease in synaptic transmission can reverse the propagation direction of epileptiform activity in hippocampus in vivo. Most types of epileptiform activity with synaptic transmission have been shown to propagate from the CA3 to CA1 region in hippocampus. However, nonsynaptic epileptiform activity induced in vitro is known to propagate slowly from the caudal end of CA1 toward CA2/CA3. Understanding the propagation modes of epileptiform activity, and their causality is important to revealing the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy and developing new treatments. In this paper, the effect of the synaptic transmission suppression on the propagation of epilepsy in vivo was investigated by using multiple-channel recording probes in CA1. Nonsynaptic epileptiform activity was induced by calcium chelator EGTA with varied concentrations of potassium. For comparison, disinhibition synaptic epileptiform activity was induced by picrotoxin (PTX) with or without partial suppression of excitatory synaptic transmission. The propagation velocity was calculated by measuring the time delay between two electrodes separated by a known distance. The results show that in vivo nonsynaptic epileptiform activity propagates with a direction and velocity comparable to those observed in in vitro preparations. The direction of propagation for nonsynaptic activity is reversed from the PTX-induced synaptic activity. A reversal in propagation direction and change in velocity were also observed dynamically during the process of synaptic transmission suppression. Even a partial suppression of synaptic transmission was sufficient to significantly change the propagation direction and velocity of epileptiform activity. These results suggest the possibility that the measurement of propagation can provide important information about the synaptic mechanism underlying epileptic activity.",Excluded

1148,"Putting the ""eye"" in syphilis. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Recognize the ocular presentations of syphilis LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Understand the relationship between ocular syphilis and neurosyphilis. Interpret the different laboratory studies for diagnosing syphilis. CASE: A 28-year old woman presented with one week of a deep aching pain in her right eye with radiation to the back of her head. The pain was exacerbated with eye movements. She also described blurred vision in the right eye over the same time period. She had a history of migraine headaches, traumatic C4 fracture three years ago and hypertension. Physical examination demonstrated visual acuity of 20/100 in the right and 20/ 20 in the left eye. Extra-ocular movements were intact but painful. Slit lamp examination revealed mild periorbital edema and 2+ conjunctiva and scleral injection on the right. Dilated fundus exam noted mild blurring of the disk margin nasally. Initial laboratory studies noted normal electrolytes, a negative rapidHIV, and a normal uric acid level. B scan ultrasonographywas notable for posterior scleral thickening, lateral greater than medial, which was confirmed by CT scan of the orbits. She was sent home with a one-week course of prednisone and ibuprofen with a presumptive diagnosis of scleritis. Further serologieswere pending. Initially, she had relief frompain and improved vision while treated with prednisone and ibuprofen. However, two weeks later these symptoms had returned. Her RPR was 1:16; treponomal pallidum partial agglutination was reactive. Her ANA was 1:80 with a speckled pattern. She was admitted for lumbar puncture and treatment of neurosyphilis with Penicillin G Benzathine. CSF revealed VDRL was non-reactive and a lymphocytic pleocytosis was noted on the cell count. DISCUSSION: Despite a minor decrease in syphilis rates in the United States, syphilis continues to be a disease encountered by the general internist. Recognizing the uncommon manifestations of syphilis not only improves the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis, but also other sexually transmitted infections. Syphilitic-related eye disease can occur at any stage and presents in a variety of ways. Ocular manifestations include chancres of the eyelid and conjunctiva, blepharitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, Argyll Robinson pupil, madarosis, neuroretinitis, and uveitis. Though data is limited, uveitis may be the most common ocular presentation in patients infected with HIV. In patients with HIV, the presentation is often bilateral, more severe, and frequently involves the posterior segment of the eye. There does not appear to be a correlation between CD4 count and the presence of ocular involvement. Ocular syphilis is treated as neurosyphilis and therefore must be treated with intravenous penicillin G. A diagnosis of ocular syphilis is made with non-treponemal tests such as an RPR or VRDL, measuring IgM and IgG to anticardiolipin cholesterol lecithin antigens. This is confirmed with a direct treponemal test such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody test (FTABS) or the microhemagglutination assay that measures antibodies to treponemal cellular components. A positive CSF VDRL or a lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF fluid is also confirmatory. The need for CSF analysis is debated as treatment does not change, but should probably be done, especially in patients with HIV.",Excluded

817,"Transcervical carotid stenting with internal carotid artery flow reversal: Feasibility and preliminary results. Transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS), with or without distal protection, is associated with risk for cerebral and peripheral embolism and access site complications. To establish cerebral protection before crossing the carotid lesion and to avert transfemoral access complications, the present study was undertaken to evaluate a transcervical approach for CAS with carotid flow reversal for cerebral protection. Fifty patients underwent CAS through a transcervical approach. All patients with symptoms had greater than 60% internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, and all patients without symptoms had greater than 80% ICA stenosis. Twenty-one patients (42%) had symptomatic disease or ipsilateral stroke, and 8 patients (16%) had contralateral stroke. Four patients (8%) had recurrent stenosis, 7 patients (14%) had contralateral ICA occlusion, and 1 patient (2%) had undergone previous neck radiation. Twenty-seven procedures (54%) were performed with local anesthesia, and 23 (46%) with general anesthesia. Using a cervical cutdown, flow was reversed in the ICA by occluding the common carotid artery and establishing a carotid-jugular vein fistula. Pre-dilation was selective, and 8-mm to 10-mm self-expanding stents were deployed and post-dilated with 5-mm to 6-mm balloons in all cases. The procedure was technically successful in all patients, without significant residual stenoses. No strokes or deaths occurred. There was 1 wound complication (2%). All patients were discharged within 2 days of surgery. Mean flow reversal time was 21.4 minutes (range, 9-50 minutes). Carotid flow reversal was not tolerated in 2 patients (4%). Early in the experience, carotid flow reversal was not possible in 1 patient, and there were 1 major and 3 minor common carotid artery dissections, which resolved after stent placement. One intraoperative transient ischemic attack (2%) occurred in 1 patient in whom carotid flow was not reversed, and 1 patient with a contralateral ICA occlusion had a contralateral transient ischemic attack. At 1 to 12 months of follow-up, all patients remained asymptomatic, and all but 1 stent remained patent. Transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal is feasible and safe. It can be done with the patient under local anesthesia, averts the complications of the transfemoral approach, and eliminates the increased complexity and cost of cerebral protection devices. Transcervical CAS is feasible when the transfemoral route is impossible or contraindicated, and may be the procedure of choice in a subset of patients in whom carotid stenting is indicated.",Excluded

The aim of the study was to compare different treatment plans - intensity-modulated and conformal - for head and neck cancer patients. Treatment plans were developed for ten head and neck cancer patients by applying four different techniques: two conventional 3D conformal plans (forward treatment planning, with two opposing fields 90degree-270degree and one asymmetric anterior field, matching in isocenter /Conv/, conformal parotis sparing plans /ConPas/), 3D conformal plans with inverse treatment planning techniques /INVCRT/ and intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans /IMRT/. The plans were made for the same target volumes PTV<inf>50</inf> (elective) and PTV<inf>66</inf> (boost-16 Gy). The cumulative dose was 66 Gy, and the Philips Pinnacle3 v8.0m TPS was used for treatment planning. The organs at risk (OAR) were as follows: spinal cord, brain stem, left and right parotis and oral cavity. The dose constrains and conditions for optimization were determined for IMRT techniques with 7 fields. During the optimization we applied two different protocols: in one case the plans were made by 40 segments for ""step and shoot"" IMRT techniques and by 14 segments for INVCRT, which were converted into static fields. The homogeneity (HI) and conformity (COIN) indices were calculated for planning target volumes and the comparisons were assessed on several dosimetric parameters for OARs. The IMRT, INVCRT, Conv and ConPas techniques for PTV<inf>50</inf> planning target volume gave the following values for homogeneity index: 0.13, 0.18, 0.22, 0.19, and for conformity index: 0.76, 0.68, 0.13, 0.09. The spinal cord received a maximum of 38 Gy, 42 Gy, 45 Gy and 44 Gy for the PTV<inf>66</inf>. Mean doses of the oral cavity outside the target volume were 33 Gy, 36 Gy, 30 Gy and 48 Gy. When the 16 Gy boost treatment was applied on one side only, the mean dose for the parotis on the contralateral side was 28 Gy, 31 Gy, 49 Gy and 43 Gy, while 39 Gy, 41 Gy, 59 Gy and 53 Gy on the same side. The objectives of adequate target coverage and sparing of critical structures were fulfilled only with IMRT technique. Although the sparing of the oral cavity was the most effectively provided by the traditional technique - due to the arrangement of the fields - it gave the worst results regarding the parotis and the target volume. The highest dose for the oral cavity was given by the ConPas technique, which can cause serious early and late side effects. By increasing the number of segments for IMRT at a reasonable level, the dose for OARs can be reduced. Copyright © Professional Publishing Hungary.",Excluded
1186,"TCR VB clonal expansion predicts response to adoptive immunotherapy against medulloblastoma. BACKGROUD: Adoptive cell therapy has led to robust overall response rates in patients with metastatic disease. In patients with durable responses after adoptive immunotherapy, sequencing of TCR Vbeta demonstrated multiple T cell clonotypes in the adoptively transferred cells, but showed clonotypic expansion of only a select few over time and these clones persisted in peripheral blood for one or more months after transfer. The identification of antigens associated with brain tumor rejection mediated by adoptive cell therapy remains challenging given the diversity of the bulk lymphocyte populations. We have previously demonstrated that adoptive cell therapy employing ex vivo activated tumor-specific T cells using tumor-RNA pulsed dendritic cells (TTRNA-T cells) is highly efficacious against preclinical models of brain tumors refractory to radiation and chemotherapy. Without prior knowledge of the tumor antigen targeted in our adoptive cell therapy platform, we developed a novel method to identify tumor-specific T lymphocytes from the bulk of ex vivo activated TTRNA-T cells by evaluating the TCR Vbeta repertoire using flow cytometry based spectratyping. In this study we demonstrate that TCR Vbeta expression can be used to both identify and enrich for the tumor-specific T cells from a bulk population. RESULT(S): In a murine model of Group 3 medulloblastoma (referred to as NSC) treated with adoptive cell therapy, TCR Vbeta spectratyping revealed expansion of TCR Vbeta families 5.1/5.2, 6, 8.1/8.2, and 13 in responders to therapy. Functionality assays demonstrate that these TCR Vbeta families are responsible for anti-tumor reactivity against NSC medulloblastoma cells. Survival and responsiveness to immunotherapy is strongly associated with expansion of TTRNA-T cells that express TCR Vbeta 8.1/8.2. These findings were corroborated in a patient with recurrent medulloblastoma who received adoptive cell therapy using autologous TTRNA-T cells.

Four subjects considered resistant to motion sickness were tested in KC-135 parabolic flight to examine ocular torsion at hypo- and hypergravity. Three of these showed no significant torsion at zero G in either the upright position or when tilted 30 degrees to right or left. At 1.8 G in the tilted positions they showed greater ocular counterrolling than at 1 G. None of these three subjects became motion sick. The fourth subject showed eye torsion toward his left in all positions at zero G. This leftward bias could also be seen at 1.8 G when tilted left ear down, the side that induces rightward counterrolling. There he had less eye torsion than at 1 G. This subject became motion sick. All subjects had normal counterrolling in ground-based testing. These results support the hypothesis that asymmetry of the utricular system may be well compensated in the normal 1 G environment, but unmasked in unaccustomed gravitational situations, suggesting a possible predictive test for space adaptation syndrome.",Excluded

Questions of ceiling effects and discriminability when evaluating individuals assumed to be of above average intelligence should be considered. The current study examines ceiling effects and discriminability on IQ assessment between pilots vs. mission specialists and men vs. women in the selection of astronaut candidates.METHODS: IQ scores on 104 male and female Shuttle astronaut candidates as measured by the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (MAB) were analyzed via factor analyses and tests of differences between genders, selection status, and job types. Total group, gender, and job type specificity and sensitivity and overall percent correctly classified were assessed on selected vs. unselected classification.RESULTS: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses failed to replicate the proposed factor configuration prompting reconfigured domain scores. Analyses of differences between gender, selection, and job categories found different results when using reconfigured IQ scores compared to the original formulation. The 10 subscales performed better than overall domain scores in sensitivity, specificity, and as significant predictors of individuals selected. Both versions of Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ scores performed similarly regarding sensitivity and specificity. The reconfigured scores were better predictors of selection.DISCUSSION: Evidence for sensitivity, specificity, and classification prediction was better for subscales than overall domain scores. Some consideration to using reconfigured domain scores should be given to increase instrument utility.",Excluded
11,"Hydrophobicity and conformational change as mechanistic determinants for nonspecific modulators of amyloid beta self-assembly. The link between many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and the aberrant folding and aggregation of proteins has prompted a comprehensive search for small organic molecules that have the potential to inhibit such processes. Although many compounds have been reported to affect the formation of amyloid fibrils and/or other types of protein aggregates, the mechanisms by which they act are not well understood. A large number of compounds appear to act in a nonspecific way affecting several different amyloidogenic proteins. We describe here a detailed study of the mechanism of action of one representative compound, lacmoid, in the context of the inhibition of the aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease. We show that lacmoid binds Abeta(1-40) in a surfactant-like manner and counteracts the formation of all types of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) aggregates. On the basis of these and previous findings, we are able to rationalize the molecular mechanisms of action of nonspecific modulators of protein self-assembly in terms of hydrophobic attraction and the conformational preferences of the polypeptide.",Excluded
195,"Stereotactic navigation for TAMIS-TME: opening the gateway to frameless, image-guided abdominal and pelvic surgery. Background: Frameless stereotaxy is an established method for real-time image-guided surgical navigation in neurological surgery. Though this is capable of providing sub-millimeter accuracy, it has not been used by other surgical specialists. Methods and procedure: A patient with locally advanced, distal rectal cancer and tumor abutting the prostate was selected for transanal TME using TAMIS, with intra-operative CT-guided navigation to ensure an R0 resection. Result(s): The use of stereotactic TAMIS-TME was successfully performed with an accuracy of +/-4 mm. The surgical specimen revealed an R0 resection, and this new approach aided in achieving adequate resection margins. Conclusion(s): This is the first report of the use of frameless stereotactic navigation beyond the scope of neurosurgery. Stereotactic navigation for transanal total mesorectal excision is shown to be feasible. Stereotactic navigation may potentially be applied toward other pelvic and fixed abdominal organs, thereby opening the gateway for a broader use by the general surgeon.

The Gamma Knife Icon (Elekta AB, Stockholm) is a cobalt-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) unit to support the use of a thermoplastic mask in lieu of a rigid frame, using an onboard cone-beam CT (CBCT) and an intrafraction motion management system (IFMM). We retrospectively reviewed 124 patients treated with Gamma Knife SRS from January 2018 to December 2019 at our institution using a mask-based immobilization system. Patient and treatment characteristics were collected and summarized as well as interfraction shifts and treatment-related outcomes. This dataset includes 124 patients with an associated 358 intracranial tumors. Twenty-four patients presented with primary brain tumors, which included 14 meningiomas and 10 other histologies, with 100 patients having brain metastases. Sixty tumors were post-operative, while 298 were intact. The median dose for primary tumors was 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median doses to metastases were 20 Gy in 1 fraction, 27 Gy in 3 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Median interfraction CBCT shifts were submillimeter. Median patient follow-up was 6.28 months. 91% of patients with metastases maintained local control. Our early clinical experience has demonstrated limited toxicity profiles and high patient tolerance, which suggests that mask-based Gamma Knife SRS provides a safe alternative option for frameless SRS. Patients with large target volumes where fractionation is preferred or with small target volumes in non-eloquent areas can be considered for this approach. Response rates are encouraging, and continued follow-up is necessary to investigate long-term control and survival. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1336,"Utility of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Modern Era with Magnetic Resonance Imaging Surveillance. Aims: To retrospectively analyse the impact of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) on survival and intracranial progression in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) in the modern era of widespread magnetic resonance imaging brain screening. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with LS-SCLC treated within our network between 2009 and 2020 who responded to initial therapy were stratified by receipt of PCI and stage of disease. A propensity score match analysis was carried out for stage II-III patients. Overall and neurological survival were defined as time to death and presumed death due to uncontrolled intracranial disease, respectively. Brain metastasis-free survival and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival were defined as freedom from intracranial progression and symptomatic intracranial progression, respectively. The effect of PCI on these outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Result(s): In total, 243 (69.6%) of 349 patients received PCI. On multivariate analysis in the propensity matched stage II-III cohort, PCI was a significant predictor of improved neurological survival (hazard ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.65; P = 0.01), brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.51; P < 0.01) and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.55; P < 0.01), but not improved overall survival. Two-year neurological survival estimates within the propensity matched cohort were 96.8% (95% confidence interval 87.6-99.2%) with PCI and 77.2% (95% confidence interval 63.0-86.4%) without PCI and 1- and 2-year estimates of incidence of brain metastases were 3.9% (95% confidence interval 1.3-11.7%) and 11.7% (95% confidence interval 5.6-23.5%) in the PCI group and 31.6% (95% confidence interval 22.1-43.9%) and 40.4% (95% confidence interval 29.2-54.0%) in the no PCI group, respectively. Conclusion(s): In the modern era of magnetic resonance imaging screening, PCI was associated with reduced incidence of intracranial progression in patients with stage II-III LS-SCLC who respond to initial therapy. This, importantly, translated to a decreased risk of neurological death within our propensity matched cohort, without significant improvement in overall survival.

861,"A radical approach to cancer. Reactive oxygen species are known to be potentially dangerous, but are also needed for signal-transduction pathways. Tumor cells have relatively low amounts of superoxide dismutase (SOD), which quenches superoxide anion (O2(-*)), and as a result of a higher level of aerobic metabolism, higher concentrations of O2(-*) , compared to normal cells. But this may not be true of all tumor cells. Some tumor cells have relatively higher amounts of vitamin E, a potent anti-oxidant, and a higher level of anaerobic metabolism, resulting in a balance that is tilted more towards higher anti-oxidant capacity. In both instances of higher aerobic and anaerobic metabolism methods designed to augment free radical generation in tumor cells can cause their death. It is suggested that free radicals and lipid peroxides suppress the expression of Bcl-2, activate caspases and shorten telomere, and thus inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. Ionizing radiation, anthracyclines, bleomycin and cytokines produce free radicals and thus are useful as anti-cancer agents. But they also produce many side-effects. 2-methoxyoestradiol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit SODs and cause an increase of O2(-*) in tumor cells leading to their death. In addition, PUFAs (especially gamma-linolenic acid), 2-methoxyoestradiol and thalidomide may possess anti-angiogenic activity. This suggests that free radicals can suppress angiogenesis. Limited clinical studies done with gamma-linolenic acid showed that it can regress human brain gliomas without any significant side-effects. Thus, PUFAs, thalidomide and 2-methoxyoestradiol or their derivatives may offer a new radical approach to the treatment of cancer. [References: 173]",Excluded

This study was conducted for the evaluation of the cytogenetic effects of 153Sm-EDTMP in blood lymphocytes from patients with bone metastases (without previous radio or chemotherapy), using the chromosome aberration technique. The degree of cytological damage found in in vivo blood cells of patients was compared with those found in in vitro in an adjusted dose-response curve. Blood samples were collected before and 1 hr after the administration of 153Sm-EDTMP(about 42.31 MBq/kg). The frequency of structural chromosome aberration per cell observed in 1 hr samples (0.054+/-0.035 CA/cell) was higher than basal ones (0.031+/-0.026 CA/cell), although this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.101). For in vitro assay, blood samples were exposed to different concentrations of 153Sm-EDTMP, during 1 hr (0.37-1.11 MBq/ml). An increase in the frequency of chromosome aberration per cell as a function of the radioactive concentration was found. The data were adjusted by linear regression model (Y= 3.52+/-2.24 x 10(-2) + 11.15+/-3.46 x 10(-2) X). The frequency of aberration/cell found in vivo was 0.054 and for the same activity in vitro was 0.098, this difference being statistically significant (p = 0.02). This result may be related to blood clearance, osteoblastic activity and individual variability. For a more accurate analysis, the study of more donors is necessary.",Excluded
544,"Beneficial outcomes after PCV plus RT in oligodendroglial tumors are associated with detection or risk of an IDH mutation. BACKGROUND: Oligodendroglial tumors harbor IDH mutations and risk of this type of cancer is associated with a germ-line polymorphism at 8q. In addition, when these tumors harbor a co-deletion of 1p19q, they can be highly chemo-sensitive. Indeed, patients with anaplastic tumors (i.e., AO/AOA) with 1p19q co-deletion lived nearly twice as long after chemotherapy and radiation (CRT; 14-16 years) as radiotherapy alone (RT; 7-9 years) in two large randomized trials. In RTOG 9402, some patients with non-co-deleted AO/ AOA also lived longer after CRT: for these participants, the survival curves separated after the median had been reached, and significantly more lived 10 years or longer after CRT than RT (25% vs. 10%). Since co-deletion status did not identify all patients benefiting from CRT, we asked whether other molecular hallmarks of AO/AOA - IDH or G-allele status - might be more inclusive markers of benefit from CRT. METHOD(S): We used tissues and data from RTOG 9402 to explore this hypothesis. RESULT(S): IDH status was evaluable in 210 of 291 participants: 156 (74%) had a mutation of IDH1/2. The Gallele of rs55705857 was evaluable in 245 of 291 participants: 76 (31%) carried the risk-allele in their germ-line. Presence of either an IDH mutation or the G risk-allele was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival after CRT, and an IDH mutation with much longer overall survival [9.4 vs. 5.7 years, hazard ratio (HR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.40, 0.86), P = 0.006]. For cases in which IDH was intact, CRT did not prolong median survival time [1.3 vs. 1.8 years, HR 1.14, CI (0.63, 2.04), P = 0.67] or 10-year survival rates (CRT 6% vs. RT 4%). As expected, patients with mutated, co-deleted AO/AOA lived longer after CRT than RT (14.7 vs. 6.8 years, HR 0.49, CI (0.28, 0.85), P = 0.01], but so too did those with mutated, non-co-deleted AO/AOA [5.5 vs. 3.3 years, HR 0.56, CI (0.32, 0.99), P < 0.05]. Among the latter, ATRX positive and negative cases had longer overall survival after CRT than RT, but these differences were not significant. CONCLUSION(S): In AO/AOA cases in RTOG9402, the presence or risk of an IDH mutation was associated with 'benefit' from CRT. Wild-type IDH was associated with poor overall and long-term survival, and absence of benefit from CRT. IDH mutation status identified more patients who benefited from CRT than did 1p/19q co-deletion status, but patients with co-deleted AO/AOA lived much longer.",Excluded
500,"C-Jun N-terminal kinase regulates adenosine A1 receptor-mediated synaptic depression in the rat hippocampus. Adenosine A1 receptors are ubiquitous mediators of presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmission in the central nervous system, yet the signalling pathway linking A1 receptor activation and decreased neurotransmitter release remains poorly resolved. We tested the contribution of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to adenosine A1 receptor-mediated depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus. We found that inhibition of JNK with SP600125 or JNK inhibitor V, but not an inactive analogue, attenuated the depression of fEPSPs induced by adenosine, hypoxia, and the A1 receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA). In contrast, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 did not inhibit GABA(B)-mediated synaptic depression. In support of our electrophysiological findings, Western blot analysis showed that A1 receptor stimulation resulted in a transient increase in JNK phosphorylation in the membrane fraction of hippocampal lysates. The total amount of JNK in the membrane fraction was unchanged by CPA treatment. The increase in phosphorylated JNK induced by A1 receptor stimulation was blocked by the A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), indicating that A1 receptors specifically activate JNK in the hippocampus. Together with functional data indicating that JNK inhibition decreased CPA-induced paired pulse facilitation, these results suggest that JNK activation is necessary for adenosine A1 receptor-mediated synaptic depression occurring at a presynaptic locus The adenosine A1 receptor-JNK signalling pathway may represent a novel mechanism underlying inhibition of neurotransmitter release in the CNS.",Excluded

Three-dimensional (3-D) computed tomographic (CT) scans of 72 adult patients were evaluated by two observers in a blinded fashion by comparing the 3-D images with the two-dimensional (axial and coronal) CT scans. With 3-D CT, the observers found improved visualization of facial anatomy in certain patients (i.e., asymmetries of the whole face and skull large defects of the midface and skull vault, and fractures with major dislocation). In these defects, the information can be assimilated more rapidly. The documentation of effects of cranial surgery on craniofacial growth and resorption after reconstruction with autologous material can also be evaluated more accurately. Because higher levels of radiation are used, 3-D CT protocols are less indicated in patients with minor dislocation of fractures, tumors, and inflammations.

985,"Deep brain stimulation reduces neuronal entropy in the MPTP-primate model of Parkinson's disease. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or internal segment of the globus pallidus is a clinically successful treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanisms by which HFS alleviates these symptoms are not understood. Whereas initial studies focused on HFS-induced changes in neuronal firing rates, recent studies suggest that changes in patterns of neuronal activity may correlate with symptom alleviation. We hypothesized that effective STN HFS reduces the disorder of neuronal firing patterns in the basal ganglia thalamic circuit, minimizing the pathological activity associated with parkinsonism. Stimulating leads were implanted in the STN of two rhesus monkeys rendered parkinsonian by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Action potentials were recorded from neurons of the internal and external globus pallidus and the motor thalamus (ventralis anterior, ventralis lateralis pars oralis, and ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis) during HFS that reduced motor symptoms and during clinically ineffective low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Firing pattern entropy was calculated from the recorded spike times to quantify the disorder of the neuronal activity. The firing pattern entropy of neurons within each region of the pallidum and motor thalamus decreased in response to HFS (n > or = 18 and P < or = 0.02 in each region), whereas firing rate changes were specific to pallidal neurons only. In response to LFS, firing rates were unchanged, but firing pattern entropy increased throughout the circuit (n > or = 24 and P < or = 10(-4) in each region).

121,"Timing and characteristics of perceptual attenuation by transcranial stimulation: a study using magnetic cortical stimulation and somatosensory-evoked potentials. Transcranial cortical magnetic stimulation (CMS) is a noninvasive, non-noxious procedure to induce perceptual attenuation when applied concomitant to sensory stimuli. To investigate the perceptual timing of simple stimulus features in the somatosensory modality, we applied right hemisphere CMS at different intervals following a stimulus delivered to the left hand. Different intervals between peripheral stimuli and CMS were defined according to the components of the somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP), previously obtained in response to the same stimulus. Perceptual attenuation was maximal when CMS coincided with the primary cortical response (parietal N20 potential); conversely, perception of stimulus intensity was not modified when CMS was concomitant with the N200 and P300 potentials. Using small CMS intensities, a ""perceptual dip"" was observed when CMS arrived in coincidence with the N120 potential, a SEP response thought to be originated in part in the second somatic area. Our results support the view that both N200 and P300 are post-perceptual responses. The results also suggest that the cortical processes active during the N20 and N120 potentials may be essential for the conscious perception of somatosensory stimuli delivered to the hand.",Excluded

In the two patients with BCG cystitis both reported significant symptomatic improvement; the mean (sd) bladder capacity increased from 110 (23) to 230 (23) mL, the urinary frequency decreased from 16 (1) to 12 (1) episodes per day, and using a 10-point visual analogue pain scoring system, the perceived pain score decreased from 8 to 2. Microscopically, the bladder tissue at 1 month after BCG injection showed marked acute and chronic inflammation with eosinophilic infiltration and focal granulomatous formation. At 2 months after BoNT-A injection, there was only a mild degree of chronic inflammation with few eosinophils.CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that BoNT-A injected into the bladder is a promising treatment for patients with refractory radiation and BCG cystitis.",Excluded
769,"Radiation exposure of patients in comprehensive computed tomography of the head in acute stroke. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess patient radiation exposure in comprehensive stroke imaging using multidetector row CT (MDCT) combining standard CT of the head, cerebral perfusion (CTP), and CT angiography (CTA) studies. METHOD(S): Examination protocols for CT and CTA of cerebral and cervical vessels, as well as CTP were simulated using a Somatom Sensation Cardiac 64. Effective doses were derived from measurements with the use of lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (LiF-TLD) at several organ sites using an Alderson-Rando phantom. RESULT(S): LiF-TLD measurements resulted in effective doses of 1.7 mSv for CT, 1.9 mSv for CTA of intracranial vessels, and 2.8 mSv for CTA of cervical vessels, respectively. Depending on examination parameters, effective doses varied between 1.1 and 5.0 mSv for cerebral CTP. For CTP, local doses in the area of the primary beam ranged between 114 and 444 mGy. CONCLUSION(S): Comprehensive stroke imaging may result in up to 9.5 mSv with possible local doses of 490 mGy. Although critical doses for organ damage (eg, cataract formation or hair loss) are not reached, physicians need to be aware of possible radiation induced sequelae particularly in repetitive examinations.",Excluded
174,"Neuronal precursors within the adult rat subventricular zone differentiate into dopaminergic neurons after substantia nigra lesion and chromaffin cell transplant. Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain continues in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Neuronal precursors from the SVZ migrate along the rostral migratory stream to replace olfactory bulb interneurons. After the destruction of the nigro-striatal pathway (SN-lesion), some SVZ precursors begin to express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuronal markers (NeuN). Grafting of chromaffin cells (CCs) into the denervated striatum increases the number of TH+ cells (SVZ TH+ cells; Arias-Carrion et al., 2004). This study examines the functional properties of these newly differentiating TH+ cells. Under whole-cell patch-clamp, most SVZ cells recorded from lesioned and grafted animals (either TH+ or TH-) were non-excitable. Nevertheless, a small percentage of SVZ TH+ cells had the electrophysiologic phenotype of mature dopaminergic neurons and showed spontaneous postsynaptic potentials. Dopamine (DA) release was measured in SVZ and striatum from both control and SN-lesioned rats. As expected, 12 weeks after SN lesion, DA release decreased drastically. Nevertheless, 8 weeks after CCs graft, release from the SVZ of SN-lesioned rats recovered, and even surpassed that from control SVZ, suggesting that newly formed SVZ TH+ cells release DA. This study shows for the first time that in response to SN-lesions and CC grafts neural precursors within the SVZ change their developmental program, by not only expressing TH, but more importantly by acquiring excitable properties of mature dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, the release of DA in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and the attraction of synaptic afferents from neighboring neuronal networks gives further significance to the overall findings, whose potential importance is discussed.",Excluded
926,"Monte Carlo dosimetry calculation for boron neutron capture therapy in the treatment of brain tumors. The pathology of malignant brain tumors often precludes successful treatment by surgery and standard radiation therapy. Boron neutron capture therapy consists of the selective loading of tumor with <sup>10</sup>B and subsequent irradiation with a thermal or epithermal neutron field. The neutron capture reaction <sup>10</sup>B(n,a)<sup>7</sup>Li produces high linear energy transfer charged particles that deposit energy principally within the abnormal tissue that contains a high <sup>10</sup>B concentration. Constraints on this therapy modality are imposed by radiation effects in normal tissue from thermal neutrons, neutron induced gamma rays, fast neutron and gamma ray beam contaminants, and also from the <sup>10</sup>B(n,a)<sup>7</sup>Li reactions in circulating blood. The ANDY general geometry Monte Carlo code is used to calculate the space energy distribution of all pertinent components of the dose within a simple head phantom in an idealized therapy configuration at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Reactor. The effects of <sup>10</sup>B concentration, gamma ray contamination of the therapy beam, thermal neutron beam aperture, and surgically formed re entrant cavities are examined with respect to several clinical criteria for therapeutic efficacy. It is found for the model considered that the maximum effective relaxation length for the thermal neutron fluence is 1.6 to 1.8 cm, which is 30 to 40% lower than the infinite medium relaxation length, and thereby indicated the importance of multidimensional boundary effects in this calculation. The fluence depth characteristic was verified by an experimental irradiation of a tissue equivalent head phantom with re entrant cavity, and excellent agreement was observed between measured and calculated results. It was also found that the gamma ray beam contaminant is not necessarily deleterious to therapeutic efficacy, that a larger aperture thermal neutron beam improves the dose field with respect to some criteria but at the expense of others, and that plausible size variations in the surgically formed cavity do not change the character of the dose field. As a further refinement, a Monte Carlo microdosimetry model is developed and applied to the problem of radiation effects on the cerebral microvasculature by <sup>10</sup>B capture reactions in the circulating blood. Qualitative predictions of this model correlate positively with previous clinical experience.",Excluded

903,"Dose Reduction in Contrast-Enhanced Cervical MR Angiography: Field Strength Dependency of Vascular Signal Intensity, Contrast Administration, and Arteriographic Quality. OBJECTIVE: Cervical contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) has proven accurate and superior to noncontrast alternatives. We proposed the systematic investigation of dose reduction in contrast-enhanced MRA, hypothesizing heightened tolerance at 3 T vs 1.5 T. Quantitative and qualitative features were compared between full-dose and 50%-reduced dose examinations at 1.5 T and 3 T.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight cervical contrast-enhanced MRA examinations were reviewed for qualitative and quantitative (signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) features across four dose-field strength combinations: 1.5 T, 0.05 mmol/kg; 3 T, 0.05 mmol/kg; 1.5 T, 0.1 mmol/kg; and 3 T, 0.1 mmol/kg. Quantitative features were evaluated among the following segments: aortic arch, common carotid arteries, common carotid bifurcations, and cervical internal carotid arteries. A qualitative visual rating scale was applied for the same segments as well as to the vertebral arteries along their proximal (V1), intraforaminal (V2), and distal extraforaminal (V3) courses. Significant between-group differences were reported at p < 0.05.RESULTS: Qualitatively good arteriography was observed in all segments for all protocols. No significant qualitative differences between protocols were noted throughout evaluation of the anterior cervical circulation. Significant qualitative differences were observed only for V2 and V3 segments at half-dose 1.5-T compared with the remaining protocols (p < 0.05). No significant quantitative differences were present between full-dose and dose-reduced 3-T MRA in any segment. At 1.5 T, significant decrement in SNR and CNR at half-dose was present only within the cervical internal carotid artery.CONCLUSION: Dose reduction in cervical contrast-enhanced MRA is feasible at 3 T without significant compromise in arteriographic quality in most segments. Particularly at 3 T, arteriography is quantitatively and qualitatively robust and may be advisable in high-risk patients.",Excluded
363,"Light-evoked disc shedding by rod photoreceptors in vitro: relationship to medium bicarbonate concentration. Although studies on the control of photoperiod-related shedding by rod photoreceptors in frogs suggested that the mechanisms which initiate shedding are intrinsic features of the eye, attempts to observe light-evoked shedding in opened eye cups in balanced salt solutions have been unsuccessful. We have examined disc shedding in eye cups kept in a complex tissue culture medium. Eye cups were prepared in red light from dark-adapted animals or in white light from constant light-treated animals. Light-evoked shedding did not occur in the standard medium with -20 mM sodium bicarbonate, but a large light-evoked response was consistently seen when medium bicarbonate was raised to 030 mM. In high-bicarbonate medium, light-evoked shedding was comparable in magnitude, size distribution of phagosomes, and time course to similar responses observed in intact animals. Preliminary analysis of culture conditions which support shedding suggests that bicarbonate ion concentration is of critical importance. However, lack of light-evoked shedding in a high-bicarbonate Ringer solution suggests that some additional unidentified factor(s) in the complex medium is also necessary. The data indicate that both light- and dark-dependent processes involved in the control of photoperiod-related shedding are sustained in appropriate culture medium.",Excluded

Using electron microscopy, synapses of different structures of the rat end brain related to cognitive and motor acts (sensorimotor cortex, caudate nucleus) as well as memory and behavior (hippocampus) were examined. Rats were exposed to ionizing radiation, super-high frequency, hypoxia, hyperoxia, vibration and acceleration (applied separately or in combination) which have been traditionally in the focus of space and aviation medicine. Brain interneuronal junctions were found to be very sensitive to the above effects, particularly ionizing radiation and hypoxia. Conversely, synapses were shown to be highly resistant to short-term hyperoxia and electromagnetic radiation. When combined effects were used, responses of interneuronal junctions depended on the irradiation dose and order of application of radiation and other flight factors.",Included

Effects of the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX) on tetanus- and taurine-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) were studied on Schaffer collateral-CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in mouse hippocampal slices. Preincubation with 10 microM CBX reduced the amount of LTP induced by weak theta-burst stimulation (TBS) or a single train of stimuli (HFS; 1s at 100 Hz), but did not affect LTP induced by 30-min perfusion with 10 mM taurine. Incubation with 50-100 microM CBX 15 min before HFS or TBS abolished tetanus-induced LTP. At 100 microM CBX, the concentration that is used for the blockade of gap junctions in vitro, a long-lasting depression of fEPSPs was observed which persisted under the blockade of NMDA receptors, and receptors for corticosteroids. A similar depression was produced by the CBX inactive analogue glycyrrhizic acid and the broad spectrum calcium channel antagonist ruthenium red. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from acutely isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that CBX exerts a selective dose-dependent inhibition of NMDA-evoked currents with an IC(50)=104 microM. Thus the widely used gap junction uncoupler CBX acts as an antagonist at NMDA receptors and consequently impairs the induction of LTP.",Excluded

No marked increase in fetal mortality or growth retardation was observed below 0.25 Gy; the increase in these parameters was significant only at 0.50 Gy. A significant reduction in head size and brain weight and a significant increase in the incidence of microphthalmia were observed at doses above 0.15 Gy. Detectable levels of microcephaly and microphthalmia were evident even at 0.10 Gy. A linear dose response was seen for these effects in the dose range of 0.05 to 0.15 Gy.

Background: Induction chemoradiotherapy plus surgery remains an option to study in IIIA(N2) and selected IIIB NSCLC. Here we report ten-year long-term survival of a prospective multicenter German-French phase-II trial with trimodality. Patients and Methods: Mediastinoscopically proven IIIA(N2)/selected IIIB NSCLC received three cycles cisplatin (50mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1+8) and paclitaxel (175mg/m<sup>2</sup>d1) qd 22.

506,"Range modulation in proton therapy planning: a simple method for mitigating effects of increased relative biological effectiveness at the end-of-range of clinical proton beams. BACKGROUND: The increase in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of proton beams at the distal edge of the spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) is a well-known phenomenon that is difficult to quantify accurately in vivo. For purposes of treatment planning, disallowing the distal SOBP to fall within vulnerable tissues hampers sparing to the extent possible with proton beam therapy (PBT). We propose the distal RBE uncertainty may be straightforwardly mitigated with a technique we call ""range modulation"". With range modulation, the distal falloff is smeared, reducing both the dose and average RBE over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP.METHODS: One patient plan was selected to serve as an example for direct comparison of image-guided radiotherapy plans using non-range modulation PBT (NRMPBT), and range-modulation PBT (RMPBT). An additional plan using RMPBT was created to represent a re-treatment scenario (RMPBTrt) using a vertex beam. Planning statistics regarding dose, volume of the planning targets, and color images of the plans are shown.RESULTS: The three plans generated for this patient reveal that in all cases dosimetric and device manufacturing advantages are able to be achieved using RMPBT. Organ at risk (OAR) doses to critical structures such as the cochleae, optic apparatus, hypothalamus, and temporal lobes can be selectively spared using this method. Concerns about the location of the RBE that did significantly impact beam selection and treatment planning no longer have the same impact on the process, allowing these structures to be spared dose and subsequent associated issues.CONCLUSIONS: This present study has illustrated that RMPBT can improve OAR sparing while giving equivalent coverage to target volumes relative to traditional PBT methods while avoiding the increased RBE at the end of the beam. It has proven easy to design and implement and robust in our planning process. The method underscores the need to optimize treatment plans in PBT for both traditional energy dose in gray (Gy) and biologic dose (RBE).",Excluded
613,"The role of tumor size in the radiosurgical management of patients with ambiguous brain metastases. OBJECTIVE: To identify a size cutoff below which it is safe to observe obscure brain lesions suspected of being metastases so that treatment of nonmetastases can be avoided. METHOD(S): Medical records from patients who underwent linear accelerator-based radiosurgery from August 1991 to October 2001 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were defined as brain metastasis tumor volume less than 5 cm<sup>3</sup> (diameter, ~2.1 cm) treated with a dose of 20 Gy or more. One hundred thirty-five patients had 153 evaluable brain metastases with follow-up imaging that met inclusion criteria. Median age was 54 years (range, 18-79 yr). Lesion primaries were non-small-cell lung (n = 39), melanoma (n = 44), renal (n = 37), breast (n = 18), colon (n = 3), sarcoma (n = 5), other (n = 5), and unknown primary (n = 2). Median tumor volume was 0.67 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 0.06-4.58 cm<sup>3</sup>). The minimum peripheral dose was 20 Gy (n = 132) or 21 to 24 Gy (n = 21). At the time of analysis, the median follow-up for all patients was 10 months (range, 0.2-99 mo). RESULT(S): The 1- and 2-year actuarial local control rates for all of the lesions were 69 and 46%, respectively. For lesions of 1 cm (0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) or less, the corresponding local control rates were 86 and 78%, respectively, which was significantly higher than the corresponding rates of 56 and 24%, respectively, for lesions larger than 1 cm (0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) (P = 0.0016). CONCLUSION(S): A convincing brain metastasis measuring less than 1 cm should be pursued aggressively. If the suspected brain metastasis is ambiguous, observation is proposed up to a diameter of 1 cm. This is the first study in the literature to identify a 1-cm cutoff for radiosurgical control of small brain metastases, and validation by additional studies is required.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current glioblastoma (GBM) therapies prolong survival, but overall prognosis is still poor. Irradiation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) has recently been discussed as a promising concept as this tissue harbors stem cells which seem to play a role in the initiation and recurrence of GBM. In this study, we retrospectively examined the relationship of SVZ irradiation dose and survival in a large, homogeneous GBM patient cohort.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 200 GBM patients who had been treated at our institution with trimodal therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) between 2009 and 2020. The SVZ was delineated, and dose-volume histograms were calculated and extracted. Tumors were classified according to their contact with the SVZ. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and univariable and multivariable Cox regression (MVA) were used to determine prognostic effects on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Median PFS of the study group was 7.2 months; median OS was 15.1 months. In MVA (with mean dose to the ipsilateral SVZ as a continuous covariable), PFS was significantly lower for patients with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) < 70% and without MGMT promoter methylation. Factors prognostic for shorter OS were old age, lower KPS, unmethylated MGMT status, SVZ contact and biopsy instead of subtotal- or gross total resection. There was no significant correlation between survival and SVZ dose.CONCLUSION: In this cohort, an increased mean dose to the ipsilateral or contralateral SVZ did not correlate with improved survival in irradiated GBM patients in MVA. Patients whose tumor directly involved the SVZ showed worse OS in MVA.",Excluded

998,"Subthalamic Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in Parkinson's Disease: A Cautionary Tale. INTRODUCTION: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to reliably improve several symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in appropriately selected patients. Various factors may preclude patients from undergoing DBS and for them, non-invasive lesion-based therapies such as focused ultrasound and Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery may present a safer alternative.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on preliminary positive reports of STN GK for PD, we conducted a prospective, open-label, single-center, pilot study in PD patients deemed potential candidates for unilateral DBS based on their disease characteristics, but contraindicated due to age >74, an irreversible bleeding diathesis, or significant comorbid medical disease. Stereotactic MRI-guided GK radiosurgery was performed using a single 110- or 120-Gy dose targeting the STN contralateral to the more symptomatic extremity. Clinical follow-up and imaging assessed the safety and efficacy of the procedure over a 12-month period.RESULTS: Four PD patients with medication-refractory tremors and disabling dyskinesias underwent unilateral STN GK radiosurgery. Contraindications to DBS included high-risk comorbid cardiovas-cular disease in 3 patients and an irreversible bleeding diathesis in 1. There were no immediate post-procedural adverse events. One patient who underwent left STN GK radiosurgery developed right hemiparesis and dysarthria 7 months post-procedure followed by hospitalization at 9 months for bacterial endocarditis and liver failure from which he died. The remaining 3 patients were free of adverse events up to 12 months post-procedure and experienced a reduction in contralateral rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. Upon extended follow-up, 2 patients developed subacute worsening of gait. One died at 16 months due to complications of a fall whereas the other saw no change in gait up to 42 months post-procedure. All 3 patients with adverse events demonstrated a hyper-response in the targeted area on follow-up neuroimaging.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Despite the potential for clinical improvement, our results suggest that unilateral STN GK radiosurgery should be approached cautiously in medically frail PD patients who may be at higher risk of GK hyper-response and neurologic complications.",Excluded

553,"A randomized phase II clinical trial of whole-brain radiation therapy plus concomitant temozolomide in treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer: Six-month follow-up results. Background: Despite of therapeutics progress in advanced breast cancer, brain metastases occurrence remain a frequent and delicate situation. The efficacy of whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), still considered as the standard local treatment in case of multiple brain metastases, is limited. Recently, several phase II studies have shown some efficacy of the association of WBRT and temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent already known as a radiosensitizer, with improved brain control rate (44 to 96%). Patients with breast cancer were underrepresented and none of these trials have studied this combined treatment issue in this specific population. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of WBRT combined with temozolomide in the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective randomized multicenter phase II study was developed, using a modified two-stage Fleming design. Patients with newly diagnosed intraparenchymal brain metastases from breast cancer, not suitable for surgery nor radiosurgery, were included. All patients received conformational WBRT (3 Gy x 10 to 30 Gy). They were randomized to WBRT plus concomitant TMZ administered 75 mg/m2/day during radiation period versus WBRT alone. The primary endpoint was radiologic objective response at six weeks after the end of treatment, defined as a partial or complete response on systematic brain MRI (WHO modified criteria). We also evaluated neurologic symptoms, tolerance, safety, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as secondary endpoints. A longer clinical-brain MRI follow-up was planned, each three months during a two-year period. All of the patients gave their written informed consent to be part of the study, which was approved by the local committee. Result(s): One hundred patients were enrolled between February 2008 and December 2010 (50 in the WBRT + TMZ arm, 50 in the WBRT arm). The median age was 55 [29 -79]. Eighty (80) patients had brain metastases as single secondary localization. About one third of patients had a triple negative breast cancer subtype (38,3% in the association arm and 35,71% in the WBRT alone arm). There were 26,7% and 14,6% of HER2 positive subtype respectively. The median follow-up was 30 months [range 6-60]. At six months from brain metastases diagnosis (three months after the end of the treatment), objective response rate seems better in the WBRT + TMZ arm: 52% versus 40% in the arm WBRT alone but was not statistically significant (p = 0,54). No complete response was observed. In the WBRT + TMZ group, median PFS and OS at six-months were respectively 55,6% [range 46-7 - 66,0] and 67,7% [range 59,1 - 77,6]. No improvement in neurologic symptoms was noticed. In multivariate analysis, initial TNM status was significantly correlated with PFS and OS. The concurrent use of TMZ with WBRT was well-tolerated. The most frequent upper grade II acute toxicity was reversible leucopenia in the association arm. Conclusion(s): The addition of temozolomide to WBRT in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer did not improve local control or survival at six months follow-up.",Excluded
296,"Vascular abnormalities after treatment for craniopharyngioma. Introduction: Craniopharyngiomas occur in proximity to vessels of the circle of Willis, which may require manipulation in the course of surgical dissection. The tumors are frequently irradiated which may predispose to vascular abnormalities. We reviewed a large center's experience. Method(s): Records of the brain tumor program, spanning 21 years, were reviewed for patients with craniopharyngioma. Demographics, details of treatment, clinical course, and Results of imaging over time are described. Result(s): 50 patients with craniopharyngioma were identified, 8 of whom were excluded for inadequate data. 42 patients were followed over a mean of 7.2 years after treatment, 17 of whom eventually were found to have vascular abnormalities. Of these patients, 2 had received craniotomy alone with no radiation. The remainder had radiation, 4 after failure of initial intracystic therapy and either with or without further operation. 11 were treated with operation, either craniotomy or endoscopic biopsy or resection, followed by radiation. 3 patients developed cavernous malformations, 9 patients had aneurysmal dilatation of one or more vessels, and 10 had vessel narrowing or occlusion, which in some was documented to progress. Mean time to identification of the first abnormality was 3.4 years after radiation, and 1.4 years after operation alone. 2 patients with moya moya syndrome after radiation required cerebral revascularization procedures. Conclusion(s): A substantial percentage of patients develop vascular abnormalities after treatment for craniopharyngioma. They require long term surveillance and possible late intervention. Follow up imaging must include specific attention to vessels of the circle of Willis withMRangiography.",Excluded
1099,"Carboranylporphyrins for boron neutron capture therapy of cancer. A major challenge for cancer treatment is the preferential and irreversible killing of tumor cells and minimal damage of normal tissues, both in the site of the malignancy and in the body. The agents used in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) are supposed to have the following advantages over many conventional chemotherapeutics: 1) when irradiated with thermal neutrons, an unstable isotope <sup>11</sup>B is formed whose rapid decay yields local radioactivity and a thermal effect; 2) because the free path of the released particles is close to the cell diameter, the tissues outside the tumor should gain less damage; 3) local radioactivity and heat should be harmful for cells that, in the course of their natural history, acquired the determinants of altered response to many toxic stimuli. However, a higher specificity of damage would be achieved if the drugs accumulate mostly in cancer cells rather than in non-malignant counterparts. Therefore, optimization of agents for BNCT presumes the design of chemicals with improved accumulation/retention in cancer cells. In particular, carboranyl-substituted porphyrins, the stable conjugates of macrocyclic porphyrins with complex boron-containing polyhedra, are considered good candidates for BNCT due to their uptake by cancer cells and high boron content. Importantly, the proposed mechanisms of pharmacological effects of carboranylporphyrins make these compounds potentially appropriate for elimination of pleiotropically resistant tumor cells.",Excluded

For the remaining 11 patients, the diagnoses included multiple sclerosis, inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy, ischemic neuropathy, inflammatory myopathy, and chronic disorders of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. The clinical presentations and results of locl ischemia, peripheral nerve block, nd percutaneous stimulation suggest that most limb myokymic discharges arise focally at the site of a chronic peripheral nerve lesion.",Included
912,"Recurrent non-functioning pituitary adenomas: a review on the new pathological classification, management guidelines and treatment options. At least 50% of surgically resected non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) recur. Either early or late adjuvant radiotherapy is highly efficacious in controlling recurrent NFPA but associates potentially burdensome complications like hypopituitarism, vascular complications or secondary neoplasm. Reoperation is indicated in bulky tumor rests compressing the optic pathway. To date, no standardized medical therapy is available for recurrent NFPA although cabergoline and temozolomide show promising results. Guidelines on the management of recurrent NFPAs are now available. The new 2017 WHO pituitary tumor classification, based on immunohistochemistry and transcription factor assessment, identifies a group of aggressive NFPA variants that may benefit from earlier adjuvant therapy. Nevertheless, NFPA patients exhibit a reduced overall life expectancy largely due to hypopituitarism and treatment-related morbidity. The management of recurrent NFPA benefits from a multidisciplinary teamwork of surgeons, endocrinologists, radiation oncologists, ophthalmologists, pathologists and neuro-radiologists in order to provide individualized therapy and anticipate deterioration.

929,"Circadian and light regulation of oxytocin and parvalbumin protein levels in the ciliated ependymal layer of the third ventricle in the C57 mouse. The walls of the third ventricle have been proposed to serve as a bidirectional conduit for exchanges between the neural parenchyma and the cerebrospinal fluid. In immunohistochemical studies of mice, we observed that light exposure and circadian phase affected peptide staining surrounding the third ventricle at the level of the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Under high magnification, we observed robust staining for the neurohormone oxytocin and the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin associated with cilia extending into the third ventricle from the surrounding ventricular wall; no similar staining was observed for vasopressin or calbindin. Retinal illumination had opposite effects on levels of parvalbumin and oxytocin in the cilia: light exposure during late subjective night increased oxytocin staining, but decreased parvalbumin staining in the cilia. Preventing cellular transport with colchicine eliminated immunohistochemical staining for oxytocin in the cilia. There was also a significant daily rhythm of oxytocin immunostaining in the third ventricle wall, and in magnocellular neurons in the anterior hypothalamus. The results suggest that environmental lighting and circadian rhythms regulate levels of oxytocin in the cerebrospinal fluid, possibly by regulating movement of oxytocin through the third ventricle wall.",Excluded
542,"Metallothionein induction in human CNS in vitro: neuroprotection from ionizing radiation. PURPOSE: There have been extensive studies on the regulation of metallothionein (MT) synthesis, and its biological role in liver and kidney. Although there are few reports on brain MT, there is a growing interest in the role of MT in brain. There have been no publications to date on MT synthesis in the human central nervous system (CNS) following exposure to ionizing radiation. In the present study, primary human CNS cultures were used to examine the effect of ionizing radiation on MT mRNA and protein synthesis. In the same cultures, the neuroprotective effects of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd)-induced MT synthesis from high-dose radiation were also examined.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary, serum-free, human CNS cultures were exposed to 30 or 60 Gy gamma-rays. The total MT protein was then measured by a Cd-heme assay, and mRNA for MT-II and MT-III was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cytotoxicity was measured by LDH release and apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis. Sublethal neuroglial injury was assessed morphologically using specific astrocytic (glial fibrillary acidic protein--GFAP) and neuronal (microtubule-associated protein 2--MAP2) immunohistochemical markers.RESULTS: The total MT protein content was increased 12h after exposure to 30Gy. The increase in MT content in response to 60Gy was not statistically significant. MT-II mRNA levels increased at 3 and 6h after exposure to 30Gy gamma-rays, with a maximum expression at 12-24 h. MT-III mRNA was not significantly affected. Exposure to 60 Gy, but not 30 Gy, caused a marked increase in LDH release. Cells exposed to 30 Gy or less showed some apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis, while exposure to 60 Gy resulted in a DNA smear confirmed by LDH assays. Preinduction of MT by 5 microM Cd or 100 microM Zn resulted in a significant reduction in radiation-induced LDH release. Morphological evaluations revealed that Cd or Zn preincubation led to relative preservation of MAP2 staining and GFAP.CONCLUSION: Both MT protein and MT-II mRNA can be induced in human CNS cells by ionizing radiation. Furthermore, induction of MT synthesis with Zn and Cd can protect human CNS cells from radiation-induced cytocidal and sublethal injuries. Both findings have implications in the development of strategies to protect human CNS tissue from damage during radiotherapy.",Included

Muscular atonia and cortical desynchronization, two signs of desynchronized sleep, can be enhanced or suppressed by direct injection of carbachol into the pontine brain stem of cats. The positive effects are graded, being maximal in the gigantocellular tegmental field and less marked in adjacent nuclei. These positive effects are dose-dependent. Suppressive effects of carbachol are maximal in the region of the locus coeruleus and are dose-dependent but do not exceed those of the vehicle alone. The results support the hypothesis that cholinergic mechanisms of the pontine tegmentum are involved in desynchronized sleep generation.",Excluded
749,ATM induction insufficiency in a radiosensitive breast-cancer patient. The ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) gene (ATM) is a dominant breast cancer gene with tumour suppressor activity. ATM also regulates cellular sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) presumably through its role as a facilitator of DNA repair. In normal cells and tissues the ATM protein is rapidly induced by IR to threshold/maximum levels. The kinase function of the ATM protein is also rapidly activated in response to IR. The fact that women carriers of ATM mutations can have an increased risk of developing breast cancer and that many sporadic breast tumours have reduced levels of the ATM protein broadens the scope of ATM's tumour suppressor within the breast. This report describes the downregulation of ATM protein levels in a radiosensitive breast cancer patient. Postinduction ATM levels were up to tenfold lower in the patient's fresh tissues compared to normal controls. These results might indicate a much broader role for ATM anomalies in breast cancer aetiology.,Excluded
1030,"Gamma knife surgery in the treatment of intracanalicular vestibular schwannomas. OBJECTIVE: According to the literature, gamma knife surgery (GKS) is a promising method for intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma (IVS) management, providing excellent tumor growth control rates (91%-100%) and good hearing preservation rates (41%-76%), but this evidence originates primarily from a small series of patients. The aim of this study was to present the outcomes of GKS in the largest group of patients with IVS studied to date, with particular emphasis on the long-term outcomes of treatment.METHODS: The study included 136 consecutive patients with unilateral IVS, who underwent GKS in 2011-2015. Mean age of the patients was 54 +/- 12.6 years. All patients were operated on with a 192-source cobalt-60 gamma knife unit. All patients had complete follow-up documentation and the mean duration of the follow-up was 52 +/- 13.8 months (6-83 months). Neurological status (facial and trigeminal nerve), hearing and instability/dizziness presence were determined prior to GKS, immediately after the procedure, and during the follow-up visits.RESULTS: Tumor growth control was obtained in 124/136 (~91.2%) patients. Hearing improvement was observed in 32/136 (23.5%) patients, and there was a distinct cluster of 9 patients (6.6%) regaining serviceable hearing after GKS, whereas in 36 patients (26.5%) was stable. Four patients developed facial nerve dysfunction, including 3 periodic hemifacial spasm and 1 partial paresis, which resolved spontaneously within 12 months of GKS. None of the operated patients showed new, debilitating neurological deficits, including trigeminal sensory disturbances or hydrocephalus.CONCLUSIONS: GKS is a highly effective treatment for IVS, associated with low morbidity and good tumor growth control.",Excluded
486,"Comparison of a flexible versus a rigid breast compression paddle: pain experience, projected breast area, radiation dose and technical image quality. PURPOSE: To compare pain, projected breast area, radiation dose and image quality between flexible (FP) and rigid (RP) breast compression paddles.METHODS: The study was conducted in a Dutch mammographic screening unit (288 women). To compare both paddles one additional image with RP was made, consisting of either a mediolateral-oblique (MLO) or craniocaudal-view (CC). Pain experience was scored using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Projected breast area was estimated using computer software. Radiation dose was estimated using the model by Dance. Image quality was reviewed by three radiologists and three radiographers.RESULTS: There was no difference in pain experience between both paddles (mean difference NRS: 0.08 +/- 0.08, p = 0.32). Mean radiation dose was 4.5 % lower with FP (0.09 +/- 0.01 p = 0.00). On MLO-images, the projected breast area was 0.79 % larger with FP. Paired evaluation of image quality indicated that FP removed fibroglandular tissue from the image area and reduced contrast in the clinically relevant retroglandular area at chest wall side.CONCLUSIONS: Although FP performed slightly better in the projected breast area, it moved breast tissue from the image area at chest wall side. RP showed better contrast, especially in the retroglandular area. We therefore recommend the use of RP for standard MLO and CC views.",Excluded
735,"Hypo-fractionated IMRT for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: a 6 year single institutional experience. OBJECTIVES: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults. Surgery and radiotherapy constitute the cornerstones for the therapeutic management of GBM. The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol. Despite the progress in neurosurgery, radiotherapy and oncology, the prognosis still results poor. In order to reduce the long time of standard treatment, maintaining or improving the clinical results, in our institute we have investigated the effects of hypo-fractionated radiation therapy for patients with GBM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients affected by GBM who had previously undergone surgical resection (total, subtotal or biopsy) were enrolled between October 2005 and December 2011 in a single institutional study of hypo-fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) followed or not by adjuvant chemotherapy with TMZ (6-12 cycles). The most important eligibility criteria were: biopsy-proven GBM, KPS >= 60, age >= 18 years, no previous brain irradiation, informed consensus. Hypo-fractionated IMRT was delivered to a total dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions prescribed to 70% isodose. Response to treatment, OS, PFS, toxicity and patterns of recurrence were evaluated, and sex, age, type of surgery, Karnofsky performance status, Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification, time between surgery and initiation of radiotherapy were evaluated as potential prognostic factors for survival.RESULTS: All patients have completed the treatment protocol. Median age was 64.5 years (range 41-82 years) with 31 females (46%) and 36 males (54%). Median KPS at time of treatment was 80. The surgery was gross total in 38 patients and subtotal in 14 patients; 15 patients underwent only biopsy. No grade 3-4 acute or late neurotoxicity was observed. With median follow-up of 14.9 months, the median OS and PFS were 13.4 and 7.9 months, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The hypo-fractionated radiation therapy can be used for patients with GBM, resulting in favourable overall survival, low rates of toxicity and satisfying QoL. Future investigations are needed to determine the optimal fractionation for GBM.",Excluded
1182,"Evaluation of Lower-Dose Spiral Head CT for Detection of Intracranial Findings Causing Neurologic Deficits. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the frequent use of unenhanced head CT for the detection of acute neurologic deficit, the radiation dose for this exam varies widely. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of lower-dose head CT for detection of intracranial findings resulting in acute neurologic deficit.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Projection data from 83 patients undergoing unenhanced spiral head CT for suspected neurologic deficits were collected. Cases positive for infarction, intra-axial hemorrhage, mass, or extra-axial hemorrhage required confirmation by histopathology, surgery, progression of findings, or corresponding neurologic deficit; cases negative for these target diagnoses required negative assessments by two neuroradiologists and a clinical neurologist. A routine dose head CT was obtained using 250 effective mAs and iterative reconstruction. Lower-dose configurations were reconstructed (25-effective mAs iterative reconstruction, 50-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection). Three neuroradiologists circled findings, indicating diagnosis, confidence (0-100), and image quality. The difference between the jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit at routine and lower-dose configurations was estimated. A lower 95% CI estimate of the difference greater than -0.10 indicated noninferiority.RESULTS: Forty-two of 83 patients had 70 intracranial findings (29 infarcts, 25 masses, 10 extra- and 6 intra-axial hemorrhages) at routine head CT (CT dose index = 38.3 mGy). The routine-dose jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81-0.93). Noninferiority was shown for 100-effective mAs iterative reconstruction (figure of merit difference, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.004) and 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection (-0.02; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.02) but not for 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection (-0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02) or lower-dose levels. Image quality was better at higher-dose levels and with iterative reconstruction (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Observer performance for dose levels using 100-200 eff mAs was noninferior to that observed at 250 effective mAs with iterative reconstruction, with iterative reconstruction preserving noninferiority at a mean CT dose index of 15.2 mGy.",Excluded
111,"Left fronto-temporal lobe dementia caused by gamma knife surgery in an elderly woman. Introduction: Dementing processes in the geriatric population are devastating and can result in early death and increased care giver burden. FTD has the core features of earlier decline and impairment in regulation of social interpersonal conduct.We describe a case of an elderly female who was found to have features of FTD which had directly resulted from gamma knife surgery. This is the first described case of left FTD secondary to gamma knife radiation to our knowledge. Case: The patient is a 76 year old African American female, otherwise healthy and on no any medications with a history of a left frontotemporal arteriovenous malformation. She underwent gamma knife radiation treatment resulting in radiation necrosis eight years prior to presentation. She presented to the clinic escorted by her daughter who observed personality changes in the patient including becoming argumentative, uncooperative, and increasingly hyper religious, with increased interpersonal conflicts surrounding patient's inability to follow-through on plans. The patient only admitted to trouble with memory. Patient was observed to have disinhibition and inappropriateness during the group interview. Geriatric Depression Scale was negative for depression. Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 15/30 with deficits including: recall 0/5, language (1/3 naming, 0/2 repetition, 0/1 fluency with only 3 F words), calculation 0/3; while attention and orientations were intact. Patient was unable to perform Trail-making test, Part B. Otherwise, she appeared robust, independent in ADL but needing some assistance with IADL. Given her behavioral changes including tactlessness and poor social judgment, executive dysfunction, memory impairment and language deficits in the context of prior left frontal lobe radiation injury, she was given the diagnosis of left predominant FTD. Conclusion(s): Isolated and localized brain anomalies and their treatment are the rare causes of brain dysfunctions. In this unfortunate case, our patient's FTD is a direct result of her iatrogenic radiation necrosis. Appropriate diagnosis of this patient's condition via correlation of her cognitive deficit with radiographic findings allowed for appropriate counseling of both the patient and family in regards to the permanent nature of her condition. This in turn resulted in acceptance of her condition by her family, establishing prognosis and helping to facilitate her long term care plan.",Excluded
745,"Optimization of stereotactic radiotherapy treatment delivery technique for base-of-skull meningiomas. This study compares static conformal field (CF), intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and dynamic arcs (DA) for the stereotactic radiotherapy of base-of-skull meningiomas. Twenty-one cases of base-of-skull meningioma (median planning target volume [PTV] = 21.3 cm3) previously treated with stereotactic radiotherapy were replanned with each technique. The plans were compared for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI), and doses to normal structures at 6 dose values from 50.4 Gy to 5.6 Gy. The mean CI was 1.75 (CF), 1.75 (DA), and 1.66 (IMRT) (p < 0.05 when comparing IMRT to either CF or DA plans). The CI (IMRT) was inversely proportional to the size of the PTV (Spearman's rho = -0.53, p = 0.01) and at PTV sizes above 25 cm3, the CI (IMRT) was always superior to CI (DA) and CI (CF). At PTV sizes below 25 cm3, there was no significant difference in CI between each technique. There was no significant difference in HI between plans. The total volume of normal tissue receiving 50.4, 44.8, and 5.6 Gy was significantly lower when comparing IMRT to CF and DA plans (p < 0.05). There was significantly improved dose sparing for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe with IMRT but no significant difference for the optic chiasm or pituitary gland. These results demonstrate that stereotactic IMRT should be considered to treat base-of-skull meningiomas with a PTV larger than 25 cm3, due to improved conformity and normal tissue sparing, in particular for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe.",Excluded
887,"Temozolomide induced c-Myc-mediated apoptosis via Akt signalling in MGMT expressing glioblastoma cells. PURPOSE: We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of Temozolomide (TMZ) in both O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyl transferase (MGMT) depleted as well as undepleted glioblastoma cell lines. Since TMZ is used in clinics in combination with radiotherapy, we also studied the effects of TMZ in combination with ionising radiation (IR).METHODS: Cell colony-forming ability was measured using a clonogenic assay. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis were evaluated by Flow Cytometry (FCM). Proteins involved in cell cycle control were detected by Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assays.RESULTS: Our data showed that TMZ, independent of MGMT expression, inhibited glioblastoma cell growth via an irreversible G(2) block in MGMT depleted cells or the induction of apoptosis in MGMT normal expressing cells. When TMZ was administered in combination with IR, apoptosis was greater than observed with either agent separately. This TMZ-induced apoptosis in the MGMT expressing cells occurred through Akt/Glycogen-Synthase-Kinase-3s (GSK3s) signalling and was mediated by Myelocytomatosis (c-Myc) oncoprotein. Indeed, TMZ phosphorylated/activated Akt led to phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK3s which resulted in the stabilisation of c-Myc protein and subsequent modulation of the c-Myc target genes involved in the apoptotic processes.CONCLUSION: C-Myc expression could be considered a good indicator of TMZ effectiveness.",Excluded

A nonfluoroscopic temporomandibular joint arthrographic technique is contrasted with a more widely employed fluoroscopically guided technique. The nonfluoroscopic technique uses a posterior approach to joint injection, as contrasted with the lateral injection approach of the fluoroscopically guided technique. The advantages of the nonfluoroscopic technique are less radiation dose to the patient, less expensive and less sophisticated imaging equipment, and less potential for neurovascular trauma. The fluoroscopic technique offers greater control of the procedure, less patient and operator time, and the capability for a dynamic videofluoroscopic study. Both techniques appear to be safe and efficacious. Differences in anatomy, imaging modalities, patient radiation exposure, and potential complications are also discussed as part of this comparison.
