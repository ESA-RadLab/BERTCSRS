1371,"Long-term hearing status after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma This paper evaluates the hearing status in the long-term, of patients who have had radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and also discusses the hearing losses from a disability point of view, which takes into account binaural hearing. Forty patients who have had NPC successfully treated by a single radical course of radiotherapy of 70-80 Gy were studied at 2-12 years (mean 6.2 years) after radiotherapy. Each patient was examined clinically and with a pure-tone audiogram. Averaged hearing thresholds over 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 kHz were evaluated and a value > 30 dB was considered abnormal. The findings were compared with age-matched controls. The median hearing threshold for each ear in NPC patients was found to be 31.9 dB (range 10.0-86.3 dB) and that for controls 17.5 dB (7.5-38.8 dB) (P < 0.0005, Wilcoxon's matched pairs test). In NPC patients, 44 ears (55.0%) had abnormal hearing, of which 17 (21.3%), 5 (6.3%) and 22 (27.5%) ears had predominantly sensori-neural, conductive and mixed hearing losses, respectively. Nineteen ears had middle ear effusions, accounting for the majority of mixed and conductive hearing losses. In terms of individual patients, 8 (20.0%) and 18 (45.0%) patients had abnormal hearing in one year (monaural hearing disability) and both ears (binaural hearing disability), respectively. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients who have had radiotherapy for NPC, have hearing disability in the long-term, as compared to normal controls.",Included

3075,"[Virtual reality in neurosurgery] DEFINITION: Virtual reality enables users to immerse themselves in a virtual three-dimensional world and to interact in this world. The simulation is different from the kind in computer games, in which the viewer is active but acts in a nonrealistic world, or on the TV screen, where we are passively driven in an active world. In virtual reality elements look realistic, they change their characteristics and have almost real-world unpredictability.USE OF VIRTUAL REALITY: Virtual reality is not only implemented in gambling dens and the entertainment industry but also in manufacturing processes (cars, furniture etc.), military applications and medicine. Especially the last two areas are strongly correlated, because telemedicine or telesurgery was originated for military reasons to operate on war victims from a secure distance or to perform surgery on astronauts in an orbiting space station. In medicine and especially neurosurgery virtual-reality methods are used for education, surgical planning and simulation on a virtual patient. [References: 33]",Excluded
975,"Treatment strategy for brain metastases from esophageal cancer BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the treatment outcomes of patients with brain metastases from esophageal cancer. Brain metastases from esophageal cancer are rare and have a poorer prognosis than brain metastases from lung and breast cancer.METHODS: This study included patients who were diagnosed with and treated for esophageal cancer in our department and subsequently developed brain metastases between April 2010 and December 2014. We examined the differences in survival in patients based on receiving chemotherapy.RESULTS: In total, 8 patients (7 men and 1 woman) with a mean age of 65 years (range 51-73) were included. Seven presented with neurologic symptoms. Two were diagnosed via computed tomography (CT), 5 via magnetic resonance imaging, and 1 via positron emission tomography/CT. They were treated using whole-brain irradiation or with a gamma knife. In 5 patients, chemotherapy was administered after treatment of the brain metastases. The mean survival from the start of treatment was 358 days (range 31-1196).CONCLUSION: The relatively successful local control of brain metastases in these patients indicates that long-term survival may be attainable via concomitant chemotherapy.",Excluded
1698,[Use of DNA antibodies for detecting DNA radiation injuries in the bone marrow cell nuclei of irradiated animals] Impairments in DNA from brain stem cell nuclei of X-ray irradiated animals were studied at early steps after irradiation using antibodies to single-stranded DNA. A possibility was shown to detect by means of an immunochemical technique the irradiation-induced impairments of DNA in brain stem cells. Detection of the impairment was possible within 3 hrs after high doses of the irradiation (206.4-258 mCi/kg); after lower doses - within the first hour of the postirradiation period. The immunochemical procedure might be used for early biological detection of the irradiation impairments as well as for estimation of radio-sensitivity of nuclear cells to the effects of irradiation and radioprotectors.,Included

3144,"Clinical impact of re-irradiation with carbon ion radiotherapy for locally recurrent rectal cancer Purpose or Objective: The re-irradiation of locally recurrent rectal cancer presents challenges due to the proximity of critical organs such as bowel. Ion beam therapy, specifically carbon ions radiotherapy (CIRT) have some advantages for the favorable relative biological effectiveness and physical dose distribution providing a highly conformal dose distribution while minimizing normal tissue damage. The aim of this study is to report our experience on feasibility and toxicity of carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in previously irradiated patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Between August 2014 and February 2017, a total of 10 patients (M:F= 8:2) were treated with CIRT as re-irradiation for locally recurrent rectal cancer at National Centre of Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO). Patient ages ranged between 46 to 78 years (median 58.5 years). All patients had a history of surgery and pelvic radiotherapy. Specifically, the dose of previous radiotherapy ranged from 45 to 50.4 Gy in 9 patients one of which received a brachytherapy boost up to a total dose of 20Gy. One patient was irradiated with a total dose of 76 Gy for a prostatic cancer. One patient, at time of the first recurrence, underwent to re-irradiation with stereotactic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 6 fractions). They had 7 presacral, 1 perineal, 1 perianal and 1 pre-coccygeal relapses. Three patients received spacer implantation prior to CIRT to secure adequate distance between bowel and tumor. Toxicity was scored according CTCAE 4.0 scale. Results The median interval between the two courses of radiotherapy was 89.3 months (range: 13.8 - 138.2). Median total dose of CIRT was 60 GyRBE (range: 35-76.8) and was administered in a median number of 16 fractions (range: 15-20) over 4 weeks (from 3 to 4.8 Gy RBE/fraction). The GTV ranged from 7.21 to 300.8 cm<sup>3</sup> with a median of 28.42 cm<sup>3</sup>. The PTV ranged from 53.55 to 742.64 cm<sup>3</sup>. All patients completed the scheduled treatment course. Median follow-up was 13 months. Acute toxicity was mild and mainly neuropathic: grade 2 (G2) neuropathic pain in 1 (10%) and G1 in 2 (20%) patients. The major late toxicities were peripheral neuropathy (20%, G2). No G>=3 acute/late reaction nor pelvic infections were observed. Four patients were diagnosed with local progression after carbon ion radiotherapy with a median disease free survival of 11.4 months (range: 2.4- 39.7). Three patients experienced systemic progression. The estimated 1-year-local control rate was 80%. Conclusion(s): In our experience, CIRT for locally recurrent rectal cancer appears to be safe and effective with an acceptable rate of morbidity of normal tissue. More data and longer follow-up are required to investigate the long-term disease control and to determine late effects. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded

3054,"Corilagin Attenuates Radiation-Induced Brain Injury in Mice Cranial irradiation-induced inflammation plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI). Anti-inflammation treatment may provide therapeutic benefits. Corilagin (beta-1-O-galloyl-3, 6-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-D-glucose, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>18</sub>) was a novel member of the tannin family with anti-inflammatory properties and is isolated from some medicinal plants, such as Phyllanthus amarus and Caesalpinia coriaria. In this study, the effect of Corilagin on RIBI was investigated and the underlying mechanisms were explored. Spatial learning and memory ability of mice were investigated by the Morris water maze test. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy were used to assess the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, were measured by using real-time PCR and Western blotting. The activation of microglial cells and expression of TNF-alpha were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and IkappaBalpha, and the translocation of p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus were detected by using Western blotting. Morris water maze test showed that Corilagin ameliorated the neurocognitive deficits in RIBI mice. Evans blue leakage and electron microscopy exhibited that Corilagin partially protected the BBB integrity from cranial irradiation-caused damage; immunofluorescence staining showed that Corilagin could inhibit microglial activation and TNF-alpha expression. Real-time PCR and Western blotting revealed that Corilagin downregulated the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and inhibited the irradiation-induced activation of NF-kappaB pathways by upregulating p-STAT3 expression. In conclusion, Corilagin could attenuate RIBI through inhibiting microglial activation and the expressions of inflammatory cytokines. Corilagin might inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB pathway in a STAT3-associated manner, thereby downregulating the inflammatory cytokine expressions.",Included
108,"A prospective, phase II study demonstrating the potential value and limitation of radiosurgery for spine metastases PURPOSE: To evaluate toxicity, efficacy, feasibility, and target volume dosimetry of single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy or radiosurgery for spine tumors.METHODS: Twenty-five patients were treated on a prospective phase II protocol of single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy or radiosurgery for tumors near the spinal cord (N = 21). Patients received 15 Gy, given a spinal cord limit of 12 Gy to 0.1 mL for patients with no prior spine radiotherapy (N = 9), and 5 Gy to 0.5 mL for patients with prior spine radiotherapy (N = 12). The primary endpoint was toxicity. The secondary endpoint was efficacy measured with a pain scale, 2 neurologic function scales, and magnetic resonance scans. Minor endpoints were feasibility and dose coverage.RESULTS: Acute toxicity was grade 1 to 2 dysphagia or nausea. There were no late toxicities. Three patients experienced radiographic evidence of vertebral body compression in field; 2 were asymptomatic and 1 was managed with vertebroplasty. One patient progressed at the radiosurgery site (local control, 95%); 43% experienced pain relief. Most patients died or developed progressive systemic disease soon after radiosurgery. One-year progression-free survival was 5% with 60% of patients dead by 1 year. Patients with the site of radiosurgery as their only site of disease also did poorly: 2-year progression-free survival = 10% with half dead of cancer within 2 years. There were no problems planning and delivering spine radiosurgery with a 60-minute treatment slot. In patients with and without prior radiotherapy, we achieved our target-coverage goal in 91% and 95%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is an excellent option for patients with symptomatic spine metastases in previously irradiated areas. In patients without previous irradiation, the biology of metastatic cancer limits spine radiosurgery's ability to improve outcome.",Excluded
1152,"Clival chordomas: A pathological, surgical, and radiotherapeutic review Background. The purpose of this study was to discuss the optimal management of patients with clival chordomas and provide an up-to-date review of the field. Methods. A schematic description of the anatomy of the clivus and its surrounding structures is provided based on the modular classification of the surgical corridors used in endoscopic skull base surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) techniques are described. Results. The optimal treatment is gross total resection. Recent advances in endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery have allowed very high rates of macroscopic and radiographic complete tumor resection in spite of the challenging location of these lesions. When the tumor location or extension is too lateral or inferior to be effectively resected with an endoscopic approach, an open approach or a combination of endoscopic and open approaches in stages should be considered. Postoperative RT is usually indicated because the likelihood of recurrence is high in spite of complete surgical resection. The main site of recurrence is local and late recurrences are relatively common. The probability of cure is approximately 50% at 10 years and significantly increases when complete tumor resection has been achieved. Conclusion. The preferred treatment for patients with clival chordoma is gross total resection (via endoscopic endonasal surgery when possible) followed by postoperative RT. Treatment at experienced multidisciplinary cranial base centers is key to minimize complications and to enhance the probability of total removal of the tumors. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Mice living under standard vivarium conditions served as a control. The motoneurons of experimental animals demonstrated the reactive changes that were manifested by the increase of their size, decrease in the number of subpopulations expressing ChAT and NF, increase of subpopulations containing CAB, appearance of motor neurons expressing nNOS, caspase-3, and the absence of Ki-67. The lack of proliferating gliocytes, the preservation of nucleolar component indicate the absence of necrobiotic changes characteristic of necrosis. The cytoplasmic vacuolization was observed in thionine-stained CAB-immunoreactive neurons.

2946,"Mechanisms of caspase-1 mediated schwannoma regression Schwannoma tumors are composed of Schwann-lineage cells and form along peripheral, spinal and cranial nerves. These tumors can cause pain, sensory/motor dysfunction, and death through compression of peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, and/or the brain stem. We have previously shown gene therapy for these tumors using a xenograft model in which immortalized human schwannoma cells (HEI-193) expressing a fluorescent protein and luciferase are implanted in the sciatic nerve of nude mice. Our strategy has been to express the apoptotic protein, caspase-1 (ICE, IL1-converting enzyme) under the P0 promoter, selectively active in Schwann cells during development, using an adeno-associated vector 1 (AAV1) injected directly into the tumors. Caspase-3 is the most common pro-apoptotic target for therapeutic modulation. However, unlike caspase-3, caspase-1 has a strong pro-inflammatory component in addition to induction of apoptosis. Caspase-1 activates pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18, which in turn trigger immune responses mediated by neutrophils and monocytes, or NK cells; it has been associated with both innate and adaptive immunity. In addition, caspase-1 is activated by several chemotherapeutic drugs and can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation. Our recent data indicate that AAV1- P0-ICE not only induces apoptosis of infected caspase-1-expressing HEI-193 schwannoma cells, but also kills non-infected tumor cells through a bystander effect mediated by both tumor- and host-specific mechanisms. Supernatants derived from HEI-193 cells transfected with AAV1-P0-ICE DNA kill non-transfected tumor cells in vitro. Similarly, peripheral nerve implantation of a 1:1 mixture of AAV-P0- ICE DNA-transfected and non-transfected HEI-193 cells prevented tumor growth. This bystander killing effect induced by AAV1-P0-ICE was also observed when established intra-sciatic HEI-193 tumors were injected with AAV1-P0-ICE transfected cells. Interestingly, intra-sciatic implantation of HEI-193 cells 2 weeks after injection at the same location of AAV1-P0-ICE DNA-transfected cells, i.e. long after all of the originally implanted caspase-1expressing HEI-193 cells should be dead, also prevents formation of a tumor. These data suggest that caspase-1-induced death of HEI-193 cells in vivo leads to local changes in the region of the tumor capable of preventing formation of a subsequent tumor. This investigation of AAV1-P0-ICE induced bystander killing of tumor cells has the potential to generate new therapeutics for the neurofibromatoses, as well as, for other benign neoplasms. Not only can caspase-1 induce apoptosis, but the resulting tumor killing and associated activation of host immune responses may generate a vaccination effect that could control the development and growth of subsequent schwannomas.",Excluded

3420,"Computerized tomography perfusion predictors of clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator Objective: Computerized Tomography Perfusion (CTP) is used to assess physiological brain tissue parameters in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Its utility for patients presenting within the 3 hrs time window is unknown and questionable given possible delay of thrombolytic administration and additional exposure to radiation. We addressed whether parameters on CTP for AIS patients treated with IV t-PA within 3 hrs of onset are predictive of good or bad outcome. Method(s): We retrospectively identified patients from our stroke registry (7/07 to 2/10) who presented with AIS and underwent CTP and then received tPA within 3 hrs of symptom onset. Patients that underwent intra-arterial therapy were excluded. A neuroradiologist blinded to outcome performed CTP measurements on a commercially available Siemens Neuro PCT workstation. Total perfusion deficit was defined as the area of infarct territory with a relative time to peak greater than 4s compared to the contralateral side (TTP). Nonviable tissue (NVT) was defined as the area of infarct territory with absolute cerebral blood volume (CBV) less than 2ml/100g. Penumbra was defined as the area of TTP minus the area of CBV. Good clinical outcome (GCO) was defined as mRS 0-2, and poor clinical outcome (PCO) was defined as mRS 5-6 at hospital discharge. Clinical perfusion mismatch (CPM) was defined as admit NIHSS >= 8 and NVT <=25cm<sup>2</sup>. Result(s): We identified 44 patients with a mean age of 68 years , median NIHSS on admission of 13 and median discharge mRS of 4. NVT was statistically different in those with poor outcome (Table 1) and a strong predictor of poor outcome when NVT was greater than 50 cm<sup>2</sup> (OR=6 , 95%CI: 1.05-34, p=0.044). TTP was statistically different in patients that achieved and did not achieve GCO (Table 1; OR=0.97, 95%CI: 0.95- 1, p=0.037). There was no statistical correlation between penumbra area, percentage penumbra, and CPM with GCO in univariate analysis. Younger age and lower admission NIHSS were associated with GCO and higher NIHSS was associated with PCO. Using multivariate logistic regression controlling for age and admission NIHSS, none of the CTP parameters were statistically associated with outcome measures. Conclusion(s): CTP parameters derived from commercially available software and published thresholds do not provide useful value beyond the NIHSS for predicting good outcome for AIS patients treated with IV tPA within 3 hours of onset but may be useful in predicting poor outcome if the area of non-viable tissue is greater than 50 cm<sup>2</sup>.

Pulmonary involvement can be seen in about 0.5 % to 2% with no difference between gender, usually in patients above 60 years old, with no correlation with smoking, radiation or chemicals. It may have prognostic variables, from the kindness of a tumor without local infiltration to metastatic and life threatening tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: MAS, male, 25 years old, resident of interior of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, workman. Six years before our first consultation, the patient presented minor bleeding with probable origin in the respiratory tract, considered initially a nasal origin. Sporadic, with no relation to climate change, physical exertion or other triggering factors. Denied other signs or symptoms. Was requested chest and sinus radiography, without alterations. Requested a CT of the chest which showed consolidation with aerobronchograms located in the apical and anterior segment of the left lower lobe. Laboratory tests without relevant findings, with negative bacillus alcohol acid resistant, culture for M. tuberculosis in sputum and serum tests for fungi. We opted for conservative treatment. Two years after the initial event, he searched pulmonology service for monitoring, and it was requested new chest CT, which showed nodule with partial bronchial obstruction and onset of the consolidation in the adjacent parenchyma. Again, the position assumed was to maintain observation of the evolution of the framework due to the absence of clinical expression. Elapsed two more years, he presented episodes of bleeding associated with cough and sneezing, more intensely. Searched otolaryngologist who requested laryngoscopy, which showed no abnormalities that could justify the symptoms. He was then referred to our clinic and brought all previously obtained material, including a new request of chest CT. He referred hemoptoics, progressive dyspnea and wheezing. Denied fever, purulent sputum expectoration, weight loss or other constitutional symptoms. Ordered additional tests including ESR (51mm ), DHL (217 UI/L), PCR (26mm ) , CEA (1.4 ng / dL), negative serology for fungi, noreactive Mantoux test. Pulmonary function tests: FVC: 2.36(46%)-2.43(47% )-(change 3%), FEV<inf>1</inf>:1.59(37%)-1.83 (43 %)-(change15%), FEV<inf>1</inf>/FVC:67% - 75%, DLCO 23,8( 1%). The previously requested tomography brought showed nodule of 3.9 cm in the left lower lobe with soft tissue attenuation, promoting partial bronchial obstruction and leading to areas of adjacent consolidation. With these results, it was requested bronchoscopy. Evolved unfavorably with intensification of the bleeding, which made us chose hospitalization for monitoring. Bronchoscopy revealed tumor mass partially obstructing the left lower lobe bronchus, infiltratating with bleeding lips. Before the results of the histopathological analysis, he evolved with intensified bleeding, with risk of death.Referred to thoracic surgery. Performed left lower lobectomy, which was uneventful and he had complete recovery. The analysis of material obtained through fiberoptic bronchoscopy as part of the surgery proved to be a typical carcinoid tumor. DISCUSSION: Carcinoid tumors represent 1% to 2 % of cancers affecting the lung, with higher incidence in age above 60 years. Presents an indolent growth and may remain asymptomatic for several years, with the first manifestations being the presence of hemoptysis and dyspnea.It can produce metastasis, leading to carcinoid syndrome, characterized by a systemic clinical picture. For diagnosis it should take into account the correlation of imaging tests and biopsy either via endoscopic or thoracotomy, depending on the location of the tumor or the physician's choice. The curative treatment is done surgically with resection of the tumor. CONCLUSION(S): Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are rare and should be part of the differential diagnosis of lung neoplasms with nonspecific manifestations. When diagnosed, it has a favorable prognosis. The treatment of choice is surgical resection.",Excluded

2103,"A review of the necessary planning target volume margins for patients receiving radiation to the brain, with the current immobilization devices in use at the hopital regional de sudbury regional hospital regional cancer program The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the current margins of the planning target volumes in brain patients being treated at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program. The gross tumour volume (GTV) is defined in the International Commission for Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU) report 83 (2010) as the gross demonstrable extent and location of the tumour. The clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as the volume of a tissue that contains the GTV and any microscopic tumour spread. The planning target volume (PTV) is defined by the ICRU 83 report (2010) as the margin accounting for both the internal and external uncertainties. With the use of image-guided radiation therapy such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), imaging and positioning has become much more accurate. A CBCT uses a 3D reconstructed volume of the patient's current position before treatment to verify and correct the setup. This is done by comparing it to the planning patient position as seen with the planning CT image and making any adjustments while the patient is on the bed (Pouliot, Bani-Hashemi, Chen, Svatos, Ghelmansarai, Mitschke, 2005). Daily imaging before treatment has allowed for positioning of the patient accurately to match the image taken for planning purposes. This allows the patient to be set up within millimetres of the position they were in for planning. Currently at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program, daily imaging for patients receiving radiation to the brain is not standard practice, however, some patients are imaged daily by request from the physician. By using the shift data from patients who have received daily imaging, the setup uncertainty for every fraction can be determined and used to determine an appropriate PTV margin for the majority of patients, who are not imaged daily. If the PTV can be reduced for brain patients being treated, less of the normal brain tissue would be irradiated and could have the potential to reduce acute and late neurotoxicity of treatment (McDonald et al., 2011). A retrospective review of patients who have previously received radiation to the brain with daily CBCT imaging will be done to examine the shifts done before treatment to match the CBCT to the planning CT image. The patient population will include patients who received brain radiation and a daily CBCT before treatment since July 2010. The images taken daily before treatment will be retrospectively studied using the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program's electronic charting system (Mosaic). The shift data examined of patients who received daily imaging can be applied to a calculation proposed by van Herk (2004) to determine the PTV margin accounting for setup error. The shift data describes the measurements by which the patient was shifted after daily imaging to match the original planning image. This equation uses the shift data to determine the PTV margin for those patients who do not receive daily imaging. All patient data will be anonymous and will be kept on a locked password protected computer.",Excluded

The number of D1 receptors (labelled by [3H]SCH 23390) declined monoexponentially with increasing radiation intensity, yielding a molecular weight (mol.wt.) of 80 kDa. Also the activity of the catalytic unit (C) of the adenylate cyclase (as measured by forskolin stimulation), decreased monoexponentially, however with a mol.wt. of 145 kDa. Both basal, DA- and fluoride (F-)-stimulated activity declined in a concave-downward fashion with a limiting mol.wt. of 134, 138 and 228 kDa, respectively. It was estimated that the basal and DA-stimulated activity originated from an enzyme complex with a mol.wt. of 325 kDa, a value close to the combined size of RGs and C. These data suggest that F- stimulation of the adenylate cyclase, which occurs by a Gs activation, does not cause dissociation of Gs into the alpha s and beta gamma subunits. Further, the DA-regulated adenylate cyclase apparently exists as a complex consisting of RGs and C; the mechanism of hormonal activation is a dissociation of C from this complex.",Included

Electroencephalography revealed frequent spikes in the left temporal lobe. In response to clonazepam, but not antipsychotics, her auditory hallucinations almost completely disappeared and spikes were reduced. Her auditory hallucinations exhibited the characteristics of first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, however, the content of experiential auditory hallucinations endured by our patient suggested an epileptic origin.

3318,"L-phenylalanine preloading reduces the <sup>10</sup>B(n, alpha)<sup>7</sup>Li dose to the normal brain by inhibiting the uptake of boronophenylalanine in boron neutron capture therapy for brain tumours Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a cellular-level particle radiation therapy that combines the selective delivery of boron compounds to tumour tissue with neutron irradiation. Previously, high doses of one of the boron compounds used for BNCT, L-BPA, were found to reduce the boron-derived irradiation dose to the central nervous system. However, injection with a high dose of L-BPA is not feasible in clinical settings. We aimed to find an alternative method to improve the therapeutic efficacy of this therapy. We examined the effects of oral preloading with various analogues of L-BPA in a xenograft tumour model and found that high-dose L-phenylalanine reduced the accumulation of L-BPA in the normal brain relative to tumour tissue. As a result, the maximum irradiation dose in the normal brain was 19.2% lower in the L-phenylalanine group relative to the control group. This study provides a simple strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of conventional boron compounds for BNCT for brain tumours and the possibility to widen the indication of BNCT to various kinds of other tumours.

1941,"Creation of a multicenter glioblastoma ontology database: A therapy-guided analysis of genotype to phenotype relationships Objective: To create a multicenter glioblastoma ontology database that can be widely utilized within the neurooncology community and which may lead to targeted treatments based on the analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships. Background(s): Glioblastoma remains one of the most lethal human cancers, with median survival of just 12-15 months after surgical debulking, chemotherapy, and radiation. Numerous molecular targets are being explored for the development of novel therapeutics, but efficacy of these new compounds is limited given the lack of personalized utilization based on known genotypic information. Furthermore, the correlation between driver genetic mutations and various phenotypic characteristics that portend poor prognosis are unknown, thereby diminishing the use of potentially effective medications in the sickest patients. Recently, ontological databases have been developed to better detect genotype-phenotype-environment relationships, with the aim of identifying novel substrates or employing known genomic abnormalities for therapeutic development. Design/Methods: This study focuses on the development of a new multicenter glioblastoma ontology database, with the goal to identify key genotypic characteristics that associate with poor prognosis. Patients were enrolled in the study at each site, clinical information was entered retrospectively into a Redcap database, glioblastoma tissue samples were subjected to whole genome analysis, and a clinical ontology was created based on historical information provided. Result(s): The creation of this glioblastoma ontology serves as proof-of-principle for the potential for clinically meaningful hypothesis generation with such an instrument and as a template for other investigators, who can use relationships described in this ontology to analyze information in their own institutional repositories. The ontology described here will be published online and available for public viewing and broad application. Conclusion(s): This glioblastoma ontology will provide a framework to which other investigators can apply their own clinical data and may help to determine high-yield genomic mutations that can be employed for drug development in glioblastoma.",Excluded

The manipulation of dietary cation-anion balance, and its subsequent effects on acid-base metabolism, have been routinely used for some time in managing domestic animal health. More recently, dietary intake by humans of alkalinizing potassium salts has been demonstrated to exert profound beneficial effects on calcium balance, bone mineralization, predisposition to calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, and overall nitrogen balance. Dietary sodium restriction has also been shown to improve calcium balance, bone mineralization, and the effectiveness of neurohumoral defenses against orthostatic hypotension. It is proposed that these simple alterations in the astronauts' diets may be easily implemented to lessen the adverse effects of physiological adaptations to space flight, and to enhance or even replace prescribed pharmacological counter-measures.

1542,"Effect of Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761) on staurosporine-induced neuronal death and caspase activity in cortical cultured neurons Previous studies suggest the protective potentiality of Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761) against apoptotic cell death induced by hydroxyl radicals, staurosporine, serum deprivation and beta-amyloid (betaA) peptide. We have extended these observations to cultured cortical neurons and studied the effect of EGb 761 on neuronal survival (evaluated as MTT reduction), the presence of condensed nuclei (monitored as Hoechst staining), the time-course of caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation (measured by cleavage of specific fluorescent substrates) and superoxide anion production (evaluated by hydroethidine staining) after the exposure to staurosporine. Results show that 200 mug/ml of EGb 761 increased cell survival and reduced the number of condensed nuclei after the exposure to 200 nM staurosporine. Vitamin E and the spin trapper alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) also significantly increased cell survival. In contrast, the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors ZVAD and ZBIOT showed no protection. Similarly, selective inhibitors of caspase-1 (YVAD-CHO), caspase-2 (VDVAD-CHO), caspase-3 (DEVD-CHO) and caspase-8 (IETD-CHO) did not protect against cell damage induced by staurosporine. The protective effect of EGb 761 was not enhanced when coincubated with vitamin E or DEVD-CHO. Caspase-3 activity was maximally induced 5-8 h after staurosporine exposure. Both EGb 761 and vitamin E showed a tendency to decrease caspase-3 activity. In contrast, activation of caspase-1 and caspase-9 was not observed at any of the times studied after STS exposure. Exposure to staurosporine resulted in increased superoxide production that was maximal at 5 h. EGb 761 significantly inhibited superoxide production at short times after staurosporine exposure. Vitamin E and PBN also significantly reduced superoxide production. Results suggest that EGb 761 neuroprotective effect might be mediated by its well-known antioxidant activity, which might also influence caspase-3 activation.

1878,"Prostate cancer: Focal tumour ablation or total gland ablation? Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers affecting the male population worldwide. Men with newly diagnosed cancer have to decide between many available treatments. In particular, patients with low-risk PC (stage T1-T2, Nx-N0, M0) can now approach a focal therapy to avoid side effects of ""whole-gland treatment,"" such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or damage to surrounding structures. The key points for focal therapy depend on valid identification of target lesions within the prostate gland, long-term efficacy of treatment, and appropriate patient follow-up. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is now available as a focal therapeutic option for the management of low-risk PC; in the last 10 years, its feasibility and safety has been tested in a growing number of clinical studies. At present, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most accurate techniques used to investigate the male pelvis; recently, MR guidance was combined with the HIFU principle and was presented as a novel technique for focal ablation of PC. MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) represents a potential treatment of choice owing to its high anatomical resolution and the possibility of real-time monitoring of temperature during ablation. MRgFUS can also be used as a salvation therapy for locally proven recurrence of PC after radiation or brachytherapy failures. The conservative approach sparing the neurovascular bundle leads to a low rate of genitourinary side effects. The technology has been well studied and developed and appears highly promising to be utilized in future as a valid focal therapy.",Excluded
1444,"Physiological and pathological observations on rat middle cerebral arteries and human AVM tissue cultures following single high-dose gamma irradiation In vitro isometric myograph and histopathological studies were performed on rat middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) to explore changes in contractile capacity following experimental Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Right MCAs were treated with 25 Gy and 50 Gy at the 50% isodose line, while contralateral vessels received 15 Gy and 20 Gy at the 20% isodose region. Survival period varied from 3 to 18 months. Reduction in contractile capacity of irradiated normal rat MCAs was detected but their lumina remained patent. In another study, we investigated human AVM tissue cultures in order to detect genetic and phenotypic modifications contributing to vessel occlusion after irradiation. In culture, the proliferation index decreased considerably following 15-, 20-, 25- or 50-Gy irradiation at the 5th posttreatment day and remained depressed during the observation period of 14 days. P53, p21Waf-1 and mdm-2 mRNA contents were elevated significantly after irradiation, indicating enhanced apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed vigorous vimentin positivity in the nonirradiated control AVM cultures, which gradually decreased by the time in the irradiated specimens. Smooth muscle alpha-actin positivity was prominent in the irradiated cultivated samples, suggesting transformation of resting fibroblasts onto activated myofibroblastic elements with contractile capacity. This transformation process was confirmed by the appearance of TGF-Beta in the irradiated AVM cell lines also. These data support the hypothesis that one of the contributing factors to AVM shrinkage and obliteration after radiosurgery might be fibrocyte-myofibroblastic cell transformation in the vessel wall.",Included
3264,"Low-dose total-body carbon-ion irradiations induce early transcriptional alteration without late Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice The cause and risk factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown. Studies on possible radiation-induced AD-like pathogenesis and behavioral consequences are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) from various sources. It was reported that total-body irradiations (TBI) at 10 cGy of low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to mice triggered acute transcriptional alterations in genes associated with cognitive dysfunctions. However, it was unknown whether low doses of IR could induce AD-like changes late after exposure. We reported previously that 10 cGy X-rays induced early transcriptional response of several AD-related genes in hippocampi without late AD-like pathogenesis and memory impairment in mice. Here, further studies on two low doses (5 or 10 cGy) of high LET carbonion irradiations are reported. On expression of 84 AD-related genes in hippocampi, at 4 hr after TBI, 5 cGy induced a significant upregulation of three genes (Abca1, Casp3, and Chat) and 10 cGy led to a marked upregulation of one gene (Chat) and a downregulation of three genes (Apoe, Ctsd, and Il1alpha), and, at 1 year after TBI, one gene (Il1alpha) was significantly downregulated in 10 cGy-irradiated animals. Changes in spatial learning ability and memory and induction of AD-like pathogenesis were not detected by in vivo brain imaging for amyloid-beta peptide accumulation and by immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta protein, tau, and phosphorylated tau protein. These findings indicate that low doses of carbon-ion irradiations did not cause behavioral impairment or AD-like pathological change in mice.",Included

The safety and durability of carotid artery revascularization through a radiated field has been debated. We describe the immediate and long-term results in a series of 27 consecutive patients who received treatment over 12 years.METHODS: From May 1990 to May 2002, 27 consecutive patients underwent 30 primary carotid artery revascularization procedures. All patients had received previous radiation therapy within a mean interval of 10 years (range, 1-26 years), with average radiation dose of 62 Gy (range, 50-70 Gy). Moderate to severe scarring of the skin or radiation fibrosis was present in three fourths of patients. Thirteen patients (48%) had undergone radical neck dissection, and 2 patients had a permanent tracheotomy. The indications for carotid surgery included high-grade (>70%) symptomatic stenosis in 18 patients (60%) and high-grade asymptomatic stenosis in 12 patients (40%). General anesthesia with systematic shunting was used in 18 patients (60%), and regional anesthesia with selective shunting was used in 12 patients (40%). Operations included standard carotid endarterectomy (n = 20), with patch angioplasty (n = 12) or direct closure (n = 8); carotid interposition bypass grafting (n = 7); and subclavian to carotid bypass grafting (n = 3). Primary closure of the surgical wound was performed in all procedures without any special muscular or skin flaps. All patients were followed up for a mean of 40 months (range, 3-99 months).RESULTS: There was one (3.3%) perioperative death, from massive intracerebral hemorrhage; and 1 patient had a transient ischemic attack. In-hospital complications included neck hematoma in 2 patients, which required surgical drainage in 1 patient. There was neither delayed wound healing nor infection. Twelve patients died during follow-up, of causes not related to treatment. None of the surviving patients had further stroke, and all remained asymptomatic. Follow-up duplex scans showed asymptomatic recurrent stenosis greater than 60% in 3 patients, 2 of whom with stenosis greater than 80% underwent repeat operation. Risk for recurrent stenosis greater than 60% at 18 months was 16.6%. Recurrent stenosis occurred in 2 of these patients after saphenous vein bypass, and in 1 patient after endarterectomy with vein patch angioplasty.CONCLUSION: The clinical results and sustained freedom from symptoms and stroke over 40-month follow-up suggests that carotid revascularization through a radiated field is a safe and durable procedure in patients at high surgical risk, despite a marked incidence of recurrent stenosis.",Excluded

819,"Two stages of light-dependent TRPL-channel translocation in Drosophila photoreceptors Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels across species are expressed in sensory receptor cells, and often localized to specialized subcellular sites. In Drosophila photoreceptors, TRP-like (TRPL) channels are localized to the signaling compartment, the rhabdomere, in the dark, and undergo light-induced translocation into the cell body as a mechanism for long-term light-adaptation. We show that translocation of TRPL channels occurs in two distinct stages, first to the neighboring stalk membrane then to the basolateral membrane. In the first stage, light-induced translocation occurs within 5 minutes, whereas the second stage takes over 6 hours. The exclusive apical localization of TRPL channels in the first stage of translocation suggests that channels are released from the rhabdomere and diffuse laterally through the membrane into the adjoining stalk membrane. In the second stage, TRPL channels are localized in the basolateral membrane, implicating a different transport mechanism. Genetic analyses suggest that activation of the other light-activated TRP channel and eye-protein-kinase C (eye-PKC) are both required for the second stage of TRPL translocation in R1 to R6 photoreceptor cells, whereas only phospholipase C (PLC) is required for the first stage. Finally, we show that arrestin2 is required for the rhabdomeric localization and stability of TRPL channels.",Excluded

They have irregular borders making surgical resection difficult and require much higher doses of radiation to achieve a favorable clinical and radiographic response. Little research has been performed to determine the role of SRS in sarcomas of the spine. The goal of this institutional analysis is to evaluate the role of SRS in primary and metastatic spinal or paraspinal sarcomas. Materials/Methods: Patients with pathologically confirmed sarcomas that received spine SRS at our institution between June 2001 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed after obtaining IRB approval. EMRs of clinical exams, and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated. Post treatment pain control, neurological improvement, and radiographic tumor control were the primary endpoints of this study. Result(s): A total of 23 patients treated to 78 vertebral levels were included. The average age of the cohort was 57 years. 45% of the patients were male and 55% were female. 64% were Caucasian, 27% African American, and 9% were of other ethnicities. The median surgical dose was 18 Gy in a single fraction (range 10-20) prescribed to the 90% isodose line. Median follow-up time was 3 months. 14 patients were deceased with a median survival of 14.6 months. Leiomyosarcoma was the most common histology among the cohort with 9 patients. Other histologies included- Ewing's (3), osteosarcoma (2), neufibrosarcoma (2), liposarcoma (2), chondrosarcoma (1), hemangiopercytoma (1), rhabdomyoblastic anaplastic (1), spindle cell (1), and unspecified sarcoma(1). The average tumor volume was 53.12 cc (range 2.02-207.25cc). Overall pain response was 75% (25% partial & 50% complete relief). Pain was stable in 25% of the patients, and no pain progression was observed. Total neurological response was 25% (0% complete, 25% partial). 94% of the patients were neurologically stable or improved after treatment. In one patient (6%) a progressed neurological deficit was observed. Total radiographic response was 67% (0% complete, 29% partial, 38% stable). Local tumor progression was observed in 33% of the patients. One patient initially had a partial radiographic response that progressed after 10 months. Another patient was initially stable but experienced radiographic progression after three months. Eight vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) were noted, two of which may be attributed to SRS. No other adverse effects were observed. Conclusion(s): A total of 23 patients and 78 spinal levels were treated with SRS resulting in fairly good response rates for pain relief, neurologic improvement, and radiographic tumor response (75%, 25%, & 67% respectively). Our results indicate that SRS has a role in the treatment of primary and metastatic sarcomas of the spine. Using slightly higher doses may provide improved response rates.",Excluded

In vivo imaging of these receptors with selective 5HT4R radiotracers and PET would be valuable to investigate alterations in 5HT4R in different brain disorders and to assist drug discovery. In this study, (18)F-MNI698 was evaluated as a potential PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain.METHODS: Eighteen PET studies were performed in 3 adult rhesus monkeys. The radiotracer was administered as a bolus intravenous injection or bolus plus constant infusion (time that would be required to inject the bolus at the infusion rate = 60 min), and arterial blood was collected for data quantification. Kinetic models were used to estimate distribution volumes and binding potentials, for which the cerebellum was used as a reference region. (18)F-MNI698 test-retest variability and upper mass dose limits were determined. Preblocking studies using several doses of SB204070, a selective 5HT4R antagonist, were performed.RESULTS: (18)F-MNI698 avidly entered the monkey brain (peak percentage injected dose of ~ 6.6%), and its brain distribution was consistent with known 5HT4R densities. At 120 min after bolus injection and after the start of radiotracer infusion, only less than 5% and approximately 10% parent compound was present in blood, respectively. Measured binding potentials were underestimated by 22%-36% when noninvasive methods were used for data quantification in comparison with invasive methods. A good agreement was found between test-retest measurements. The radiotracer upper mass dose limit (<5% occupancy) was determined to be 13.1 mug per 70 kg of body weight. SB204070 blocked the radiotracer binding in a dose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Data indicate that (18)F-MNI698 is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain, and human studies are warranted based on these study results.",Excluded

The simulations provide the possibility to perform cluster analysis in the space defined by potentially pharmacophoric measures such as dihedral angles, side-chain orientation, etc. By analyzing the statistics of the resulting clusters, the probability distribution of the side-chain conformations may be determined. These probabilities allow us to predict the selectivity of [Leu]enkephalin and [Met]enkephalin to the known mu- and delta-type opiate receptors to which they bind as agonists. Other plausible consequences of these probability distributions are discussed in relation to the way in which they may influence the dynamics of the synapse.",Excluded
2430,"Selective chest imaging for blunt trauma patients: The national emergency X-ray utilization studies (NEXUS-chest algorithm) Chest imaging plays a prominent role in blunt trauma patient evaluation, but indiscriminate imaging is expensive, may delay care, and unnecessarily exposes patients to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. To improve diagnostic chest imaging utilization, we conducted 3 prospective multicenter studies over 12years to derive and validate decision instruments (DIs) to guide the use of chest x-ray (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT). The first DI, NEXUS Chest x-ray, consists of seven criteria (Age >60years; rapid deceleration mechanism; chest pain; intoxication; altered mental status; distracting painful injury; and chest wall tenderness) and exhibits a sensitivity of 99.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98.2-99.4%) and a specificity of 13.3% (95% CI, 12.6%-14.0%) for detecting clinically significant injuries. We developed two NEXUS Chest CT DIs, which are both highly reliable in detecting clinically major injuries (sensitivity of 99.2%; 95% CI 95.4-100%). Designed primarily to focus on detecting major injuries, the NEXUS Chest CT-Major DI consists of six criteria (abnormal CXR; distracting injury; chest wall tenderness; sternal tenderness; thoracic spine tenderness; and scapular tenderness) and exhibits higher specificity (37.9%; 95% CI 35.8-40.1%). Designed to reliability detect both major and minor injuries (sensitivity 95.4%; 95% CI 93.6-96.9%) with resulting lower specificity (25.5%; 95% CI 23.5-27.5%), the NEXUS CT-All rule consists of seven elements (the six NEXUS CT-Major criteria plus rapid deceleration mechanism). The purpose of this review is to synthesize the three DIs into a novel, cohesive summary algorithm with practical implementation recommendations to guide selective chest imaging in adult blunt trauma patients.",Excluded
33,"Variation in radiation sensitivity and repair kinetics in different parts of the spinal cord BACKGROUND: The spinal cord, known for its strongly serial character and high sensitivity to radiation even when a small segment is irradiated, is one of the most critical organs at risk to be spared during radiation therapy. To compare the sensitivity of different parts of the spinal cord, data for radiation myelopathy have been used.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, the relative seriality model was fitted to two different datasets of clinical radiation myelitis concerning cervical spinal cord after treating 248 patients for head and neck cancer and thoracic spinal cord after treating 43 patients with lung carcinoma. The maximum likelihood method was applied to fit the clinical data. The model parameters and their 68% confidence intervals were calculated for each dataset. The alpha/beta ratio for the thoracic cord was also was also found to be 0.9 (0-3.0) Gy.RESULTS: The dose-response curve for the more sensitive cervical myelopathy is well described by the parameters D(50)=55.9 (54.8-57.1) Gy, gamma=6.9 (5.0-9.2), s=0.13 (0.07-0.24), whereas the thoracic myelopathy is described by the parameters D(50)=75.5 (70.5-80.8) Gy, gamma=1.1 (0.6-1.6), s=36 (3.3-infinity).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Large differences in radiation response between the cervical and thoracic region of spinal cord are thus observed: cervical myelopathy seems to be characterized by medium seriality, while thoracic spinal cord is characterized by a highly serial dose-response. The much steeper dose-response curve for cervical spinal cord myelopathy can be interpreted as a higher number of functional subunits consistent with a higher amount of white matter close to the brain.",Excluded

827,"Morphological and behavioural changes occur following the X-ray irradiation of the adult mouse olfactory neuroepithelium BACKGROUND: The olfactory neuroepithelium lines the upper nasal cavity and is in direct contact with the external environment and the olfactory bulbs. The ability to self-renew throughout life and the reproducible recovery after injury, make it a model tissue to study mechanisms underlying neurogenesis. In this study, X-rays were used to disrupt proliferating olfactory stem cell populations and to assess their role in the cellular and morphological changes involved in olfactory neurogenic processes.RESULTS: We have analysed the histological and functional effects of a sub-lethal dose of X-rays on the adult mouse olfactory neuroepithelium at 2 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks and 5 weeks. We have shown an immediate cessation of proliferating olfactory stem cells as shown by BrdU, Ki67 and pH3 expression. At 24 hours there was an increase in the neural transcription factors Mash1 and Pax6 expression, and a disruption of the basal lamina and increase in glandular cell marker expression at 1 week post-irradiation. Coincident with these changes was an impairment of the olfactory function in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: We have shown significant changes in basal cell proliferation as well as morphological changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium following X-ray irradiation. There is involvement of the basal lamina as well as a clear role for glandular and sustentacular cells.",Included
1836,"Effects of external beam radiation in the rat tibial nerve after crush, transection and repair, or nerve isograft paradigms INTRODUCTION: In head and neck surgery, radiation therapy is often administered to an injured nerve. Previous studies have examined the effects of either preoperative or postoperative radiation on nerve regeneration in rodents. In these studies, histomorphometric analysis was performed up to 8 month postoperatively. Given the exceptional neuroregenerative capacity of rodents, significant differences in nerve regeneration may go undetected if nerves are evaluated at such distant postoperative time points. This study is designed with a more appropriate model and investigates the effects of radiation after three common nerve injury paradigms.METHODS: Sixty-four Lewis rates were randomized to 8 groups corresponding to uninjured, tibial nerve crush, transection and repair, or reconstruction with isografts. Half of the animals in each of these paradigms (n = 8 per group) were treated with 10 Gy of external beam radiation to the site of nerve injury at 7 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 28, functional recovery and histomorphometric assessment was performed.RESULTS: For a given paradigm of nerve injury, no significant differences in nerve fiber number, neural density, neural debris, or fiber width were noted between the control and radiated groups, and radiation did not affect functional recovery.CONCLUSION: Radiation had no discernible effect on nerve regeneration or functional recovery in the rodent nerve injury models studied. All assessments were made at time points suitable for detecting differences in nerve regeneration between groups. These findings suggest that administration of radiation to fields containing injured peripheral nerve is unlikely to adversely affect functional outcomes.",Included

2712,"Boron neutron capture therapy combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas - A pilot study Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control, and no standard protocol has been established for their treatment. At our institute, we have often treated RMGs by tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop and cause severe neurological complications and sometimes death. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN following BNCT, recent studies have used bevacizumab (BV). We herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT to confer protection against or ameliorate BRN, and evaluated; the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. Seven patients with RMGs (grade 3 and 4 cases) were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, followed by successive BV treatments. They were followed-up to December 2017. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively. In one case, uncontrollable brain edema occurred and ultimately led to death after BV was interrupted due to meningitis. In two other cases, symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred after interruption of BV treatment. No BRN was observed during the observation period in the other cases. Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments. Boron neutron capture therapy followed by BV treatments well-prevented or well-controlled BRN with prolonged OS and acceptable incidence of adverse events in our patients with RMG.

3087,"Behind and beyond the masaoka staging: A 25-year follow-up study of tumor recurrence in completely resected thymic epithelial tumors in a single institution We analyzed prognosticators for recurrence and post-recurrence survival in completely resected thymic epithelial tumors for the past 25 years in a single institution. Between June 1988 and December 2013, 238 patients undergoing intent-to-treat surgery for thymic epithelial tumors were reviewed. Sex, age, myasthenia gravis (MG), tumor histology, Masaoka staging, characteristic of locoregional invasion and recurrence, and the treatment for recurrence were collected. Comparison between groups was conducted using the Student t test and x2 test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors. One hundred sixteen of 135 patients with completely resected thymoma and 35 of 56 patients with thymic carcinoma remained free of recurrence. In patients with completely resected thymoma, Masaoka staging, MG, tumor invasion into the lung, pericardium, and innominate vein or superior vena cava (SVC) invasion were associated with recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis (P=0.004, 0.003, 0.001, 0.007, and 0.039, respectively). In multivariate analysis, MG was the positive independent prognosticator (P=0.039). In patients with completely resected thymic carcinoma, Masaoka staging and innominate vein or SVC invasion were associated with recurrence-free survival in univariate analysis (P=0.045 and 0.005, respectively), whereas innominate vein or SVC invasion was the negative independent prognosticator (P=0.012). In patients with recurrent thymoma, those treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy had a significantly better post-recurrence survival than those undergoing chemoradiotherapy (P=0.029) and those without treatment (P=0.007). Patients with recurrent thymic carcinoma undergoing surgery followed by chemotherapy had a significantly better post-recurrence survival than those without treatment (P=0.004), but not significantly better than those undergoing chemoradiotherapy (P=0.252). In patients with completely resected thymoma, MG was the positive independent prognosticators of recurrence-free survival. Surgery should be attempted for recurrent disease for better post-recurrence survival. In patients with completely resected thymic carcinoma, innominate vein or SVC invasion was the negative independent prognosticator. Surgery for recurrence could be considered since it provided benefit for postrecurrence survival as chemoradiotherapy did. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

894,"Cell type-specific hypersensitivity to oxidative damage in CSB and XPA mice Mutations in the CSB gene cause Cockayne syndrome (CS), a rare inherited disorder, characterized by UV-sensitivity, severe neurodevelopmental and progeroid symptoms. CSB functions in the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), responsible for the removal of UV-induced and other helix-distorting lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. Several lines of evidence support the notion that the CSB TCR defect extends to other non-NER type transcription-blocking lesions, notably various kinds of oxidative damage, which may provide an explanation for part of the severe CS phenotype. We used genetically defined mouse models to examine the relationship between the CSB defect and sensitivity to oxidative damage in different cell types and at the level of the intact organism. The main conclusions are: (1) CSB(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit a clear hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, extending the findings in genetically heterogeneous human CSB fibroblasts to another species. (2) CSB(-/-) MEFs are highly sensitive to paraquat, strongly indicating that the increased cytotoxicity is due to oxidative damage. (3) The hypersenstivity is independent of genetic background and directly related to the CSB defect and is not observed in totally NER-deficient XPA MEFs. (4) Wild type embryonic stem (ES) cells display an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation compared to fibroblasts. Surprisingly, the CSB deficiency has only a very minor additional effect on ES cell sensitivity to oxidative damage and is comparable to that of an XPA defect, indicating cell type-specific differences in the contribution of TCR and NER to cellular survival. (5) Similar to ES cells, CSB and XPA mice both display a minor sensitivity to whole-body X-ray exposure. This suggests that the response of an intact organism to radiation is largely determined by the sensitivity of stem cells, rather than differentiated cells. These findings establish the role of transcription-coupled repair in resistance to oxidative damage and reveal a cell- and organ-specific impact of this repair pathway to the clinical phenotype of CS and XP.",Excluded
465,"Evidence that peripheral rather than intracranial thermal signals induce thermoregulation Numerous effector mechanisms have been discovered, which change body temperature and thus serve to maintain the thermal integrity of homeothermic animals. These mechanisms are driven by thermal signals that are processed by neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area. To keep a tight control over body temperature, these neurons have to receive accurate thermal information. Although in vitro studies have shown the direct thermosensitive ability of neurons in the preoptic area, other observations suggest the existence of peripheral thermosensation and an ascending thermal pathway to the thermoregulatory center. Direct evidences for either one, or both are still missing. In the present study, brain, rectal, subcutaneous and skin surface temperatures were measured during 15, 30, 60 and 120 min of cold exposure (4 degrees C) in rats and compared with neuronal activation due to cold stress shown by c-fos in situ hybridization histochemistry. Subcutaneous and skin surface temperatures dropped continuously throughout the 120 min of cold exposure by 1.4 degrees C and 6.5 degrees C, respectively. However, during the first 30 min, brain and rectal temperatures increased by 0.3 degrees C and 0.25 degrees C, respectively, and even after 60 min of cold stress, brain temperature did not decrease under the level measured at 0 min. Since the brain temperature did not decrease, it is unlikely that intracranial thermoreceptors are involved in the transmission of ""cold"" thermal signal to induce thermoregulation. At 30 min of cold exposure, neurons in all known thermoregulatory areas (like the ventrolateral part of the medial preoptic nucleus, the lateral retrochiasmatic area, the lateral parabrachial nucleus and the peritrigeminal nucleus) were already maximally activated. These observations clearly indicate that the activation of neurons in the preoptic and several other thermoregulatory nuclei is induced in vivo by thermal signals originating in the periphery, and not in the CNS.",Excluded

Brain metastases (BM) from these tumors are considered unlikely to be controlled using the relatively low doses used in whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Our objective was to analyze the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on local control and overall survival of BM from radioresistant primary tumors. We reviewed all patients who received Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) for BM at Columbia University Medical Center between January 2009 and April 2014. All patients were treated using the Gamma Knife Perfexion System. Dosimetric data was collected from treatment plans and metastases were categorized as radioresistant or not. Response was assessed by reviewing follow-up brain imaging studies and classified according to RECIST. Local control and median overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In total, 373 tumors were analyzed from 126 patients. Of these tumors, 49 (13.1 %) originated from radioresistant cancers. The overall local control rate in the radioresistant cohort was 89.8 and 90.1 % in the non-radioresistant cohort. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that radioresistance status of the primary tumor had no statistically significant effect on local control with hazard ratios of 1.0 (p = 1.0, 95 % CI 0.388-2.576) and 0.954 (p = 0.926, 95 % CI 0.349-2.603) respectively. Median overall survival for both radioresistant and non-radioresistant cohorts was 20.0 months, with a p value of 0.926. There was no significant difference in local control of BM from radioresistant and non-radioresistant primary tumors treated with GKRS. Both cohorts showed excellent response and local control, suggesting that SRS upfront or in addition to WBRT may be an appropriate strategy in the treatment of BM from radioresistant cancers. Median overall survival for both cohorts was equal, suggesting that improved local control may be associated with an improvement in long-term survival.",Excluded

In consideration of these trends, the objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of transcranial laser therapy with continuous-wave (CW) near-infrared laser light (wavelength, 808 +/- 10 nm, 2-mm diameter) with a nominal radiant power of 70 mW; power density, 2,230 mW/cm(2), and energy density, 268 J/cm(2) at the scalp (10 mW/cm(2) and 1.2 J/cm(2) at the cerebral cortical surface) in healthy Sprague-Dawley rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 120 anesthetized rats received sequential transcranial laser treatments to the right and left parietal areas of the head on the same day (minimum of 5 min between irradiation of each side), on either Day 1 or on each of Days 1, 3, and 5. Sixty anesthetized rats served as sham controls. Rats were evaluated 1 year after treatment for abnormalities in clinical hematology and brain and pituitary gland histopathology.RESULTS: No toxicologically important differences were found in the clinical hematology results between sham-control and laser-treated rats for any hematologic parameters examined. All values fell within historic control reference ranges for aged Sprague-Dawley rats. Similarly, brain and pituitary gland histopathology showed no treatment-related abnormalities or induced neoplasia.CONCLUSIONS: Single and multiple applications of transcranial laser therapy with 808-nm CW laser light at a nominal power density of 10 mW/cm(2) at the surface of the cerebral cortex appears to be safe in Sprague-Dawley rats 1 year after treatment.",Excluded

Thirty-seven were men, and 63 were women. The median age at GKS was 74 years. With a single isocenter and use of a 4mm collimator, 51 patients received 80 Gy at the proximal trigeminal nerve (posterior group) and 7 patients received 80 Gy, 1 patient received 85 Gy, and 41 patients received 90 Gy at the retrogasserian portion (anterior group). Follow-up was obtained by clinic visits every 3-6 months after GKS. Data on pain control, complications, and pain recurrence were recorded. The relationships between pain control status, complications, recurrence, and the target portions (anterior vs posterior) were analyzed.RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 30 months (range 3-88 months). Initially, 87 patients achieved pain-free status and 64 achieved complete remission. At the final follow-up visit, 68 patients were still in pain-free status and 42 were in complete remission. Recurrence of facial pain occurred in 15 patients. Forty-one patients developed some degree of trigeminal dysfunction. The rate of initial complete remission was higher in the posterior group than in the anterior group (p = 0.003).

Patients were reviewed at six or 12 monthly intervals for 2-19 years (median 9.5 years). Investigations included blood tests, chest X-ray, bone scan, neurophysiological studies, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine and cerebrospinal fluid examination.RESULTS: Symptoms began from six months to 20 years after radiotherapy (median time 1.5 years). Progressive weakness was universal and resulted in loss of any useful hand function in all but three patients. The time taken to loss of useful hand function ranged from six weeks to five years (median 1.25 years). Three patterns of upper limb weakness were identified, distal limb weakness only (13 patients), global limb weakness that was more marked distally (11 patients), and completely flaccid arm (10 patients). Seventeen patients required long-term morphine to palliate pain.

PMS is associated with paresthesias and pain in the hips, buttocks and lower part of body, while ultrasound-guided piriformis injections has several advantages compared prevalent and common approaches, such as well-set shape, availability, direct imaging of neurovascular structures and lack of exposing to ionizing radiation Methods: Fifteen patients (5 male and 10 female; average age, 55.6 years; range, 21-75 years) were diagnosed with PMS based on clinical history, electromyography, straight leg raising (SLR) and Pace signs. First the injection of Methyl Prednisone was applied under guidance of a Micromaxx ultrasound machine and using a 5-10 MHz, 38-mm broadband linear probe. For piriformis injection under ultrasonographic guidance, a linear ultrasound probe is positioned with its lateral side medial to the greater trochanter and its medial side lateral to the ischial tuberosity. The sciatic nerve is then followed cephalad until it courses beneath the piriformis. Ultrasound probe is directed parallel to piriformis. Needle is inserted in lateral third of piriformis.

The autoradiographic [<sup>14</sup>C]2-deoxyglucose technique was used to measure LCMRG in 5 experimental and 5 control animals. An analysis of variance was performed to test for significant regional differences. The following decreases in LCMRG expressed as a percentage change from control values were observed. The greatest decrease occurred in the globus pallidus (57.5%, P < 0.005) while the caudate nucleus only decreased to 82.6% (P < 0.05). This may correlate with proposed cholinergic extrapyramidal pathways. Ammon's horn of hippocampus decreased to 61.1% (P < 0.005) and the dentate gyrus to 71.8% (P < 0.005). These are proposed cholinergic limbic pathways from the septal nuclei. The marked effect on Ammon's horn may also relate to the specific impairment of recent memory induced by scopolamine. The auditory (67.3%), frontal (70.7%) and parietal cortex (70.1%) and the lateral thalamus (73.1%) were all significantly depressed (P < 0.005), which may be related to the proposed role of cholinergic pathways in the reticular activating system.

For analysis of gene expression patterns, total RNA was extracted from cerebellum. Changes in chromatin conformation, which are indicative of stress response and genotoxic effects, were measured by the method of anomalous viscosity time dependencies (AVTD). DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Effects of MW exposure were observed on neither conformation of chromatin nor DNA DSBs. Gene expression profiles were obtained by Affymetrix U34 GeneChips representing 8800 rat genes and analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software. In cerebellum from all exposed animals, 11 genes were upregulated in a range of 1.34-2.74 fold and one gene was downregulated 0.48-fold (P < .0025). The induced genes encode proteins with diverse functions including neurotransmitter regulation, blood-brain barrier (BBB), and melatonin production. The data shows that GSM MWs at 915 MHz did not induce PFGE-detectable DNA double stranded breaks or changes in chromatin conformation, but affected expression of genes in rat brain cells.",Excluded
2978,"Proteome-wide Adaptations of Mouse Skeletal Muscles during a Full Month in Space The safety of space flight is challenged by a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and endurance that may compromise the health and performance of astronauts. The molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy and decreased performance have been studied mostly after short duration flights and are still not fully elucidated. By deciphering the muscle proteome changes elicited in mice after a full month aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, we observed that the antigravity soleus incurred the greatest changes compared with locomotor muscles. Proteomics data notably suggested mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic and fiber type switching toward glycolytic type II fibers, structural alterations, and calcium signaling-related defects to be the main causes for decreased muscle performance in flown mice. Alterations of the protein balance, mTOR pathway, myogenesis, and apoptosis were expected to contribute to muscle atrophy. Moreover, several signs reflecting alteration of telomere maintenance, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance were found as possible additional deleterious effects. Finally, 8 days of recovery post flight were not sufficient to restore completely flight-induced changes. Thus in-depth proteomics analysis unraveled the complex and multifactorial remodeling of skeletal muscle structure and function during long-term space flight, which should help define combined sets of countermeasures before, during, and after the flight.",Included

We studied acetylcholine (ACh) release in the brain of freely moving rats exposed for 1 h during the day to a 2.45 GHz continuous wave radiofrequency field (RF) (2 or 4 mW/cm(2)) or exposed for 1 or 14 h during the night to a 800 MHz field modulated at 32 Hz (AM 200 mW/cm(2)). Measurements were performed by microdialysis using a membrane implanted through the upper CA1 region of the hippocampus. After irradiation with the 2.45 GHz RF, rats exposed at 2 mW/cm(2) did not show a significant modification of Ach release, whereas those exposed at 4 mW/cm(2) showed a significant 40% decrease in mean ACh release from hippocampus. This decrease was maximal at 5 h post exposure. Exposure to the 800 MHz RF for 1 h did not cause any significant effect, but exposure for 14 hrs induced a significant 43% decrease in ACh release during the period 11 p.m.-4 a.m. compared to control rats. In the control group we observed an increase of ACh release at the beginning of the night, which was linked to the waking period of rats. This normal increase was disturbed in rats exposed overnight to the 800 MHz RF.

Gd-DTPA enhancing radiation lesions were multiple and patchy in three patients, multiple and patchy with cyst formation in two and ring shaped in one. In terms of their distribution, enhancing lesions in four patients were seen only in the white matter within the irradiated field and these patients had undergone radiotherapy within five years. The interval after radiotherapy was more than eight years in two patients and their enhanced lesions were observed in both the white and gray matter. Histopathological findings of Gd-DTPA enhancing radiation necrosis were gliosis and coalescing vacuoles of the neural tissue. None of these enhanced radiation lesions showed significant mass effects. Patterns of the enhancement were not specific. It was considered to be difficult to differentiate tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis with conventional Gd-DTPA enhanced MR examinations. In one patient, delayed MR images after Gd-DTPA administration showed increases in the size and number of radiation enhanced lesions.

150,"Effect of microradiosurgical transections upon kainate seizure focus Multiple subpial transections (MST) sever horizontal intracortical fibers involved in the propagation of seizures, while preserving vertical fibers which are essential for brain function. Less damaging to the brain than a traditional resection,MST still exposes patients to the risks of craniotomy. Microradiosurgery uses synchrotron generated sub-millimetric beams of radiation. Arrays of tightly spaced microbeams produce a lethal effect only to those cells directly in the beam path. Low energy x-rays used for microradiosurgery have a small tissue half-value layer making the technique ideal for treating superficial brain lesions. Video-EEG (VEEG) data was recorded immediately following kainate injected into sensorimotor cortex. Rats then underwent irradiation with an array of parallel microbeams delivered to the seizure focus.Subclinical electrographic ictal events remained frequent up to 10 hours post irradiation. More prolonged seizures exhibited typical rat complex partial seizure semiologies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recording VEEG before and after precise microbeam irradiation from a synchrotron source; demonstrating a methodology which will be useful for future experiments serving to optimize microbeam doses and configuration in preparation for the treatment of epilepsy in humans. The results show some promise that microradiosurgical MST can limit the spread of seizures without causing clinically evident neurological damage.",Excluded

414,"Accelerator-based epithermal neutron sources for boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors This paper reviews the development of low-energy light ion accelerator-based neutron sources (ABNSs) for the treatment of brain tumors through an intact scalp and skull using boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). A major advantage of an ABNS for BNCT over reactor-based neutron sources is the potential for siting within a hospital. Consequently, light-ion accelerators that are injectors to larger machines in high-energy physics facilities are not considered. An ABNS for BNCT is composed of: (1) the accelerator hardware for producing a high current charged particle beam, (2) an appropriate neutron-producing target and target heat removal system (HRS), and (3) a moderator/reflector assembly to render the flux energy spectrum of neutrons produced in the target suitable for patient irradiation. As a consequence of the efforts of researchers throughout the world, progress has been made on the design, manufacture, and testing of these three major components. Although an ABNS facility has not yet been built that has optimally assembled these three components, the feasibility of clinically useful ABNSs has been clearly established. Both electrostatic and radio frequency linear accelerators of reasonable cost (approximately 1.5 M dollars) appear to be capable of producing charged particle beams, with combinations of accelerated particle energy (a few MeV) and beam currents (approximately 10 mA) that are suitable for a hospital-based ABNS for BNCT. The specific accelerator performance requirements depend upon the charged particle reaction by which neutrons are produced in the target and the clinical requirements for neutron field quality and intensity. The accelerator performance requirements are more demanding for beryllium than for lithium as a target. However, beryllium targets are more easily cooled. The accelerator performance requirements are also more demanding for greater neutron field quality and intensity. Target HRSs that are based on submerged-jet impingement and the use of microchannels have emerged as viable target cooling options. Neutron fields for reactor-based neutron sources provide an obvious basis of comparison for ABNS field quality. This paper compares Monte Carlo calculations of neutron field quality for an ABNS and an idealized standard reactor neutron field (ISRNF). The comparison shows that with lithium as a target, an ABNS can create a neutron field with a field quality that is significantly better (by a factor of approximately 1.2, as judged by the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-dose that can be delivered to a tumor at a depth of 6cm) than that for the ISRNF. Also, for a beam current of 10 mA, the treatment time is calculated to be reasonable (approximately 30 min) for the boron concentrations that have been assumed. [References: 46]",Excluded

To address the consequences of irradiation on glioma invasion, the invasiveness of irradiated glioma cell lines and irradiated astrocytic backgrounds was assessed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to quantitate the total number of EGFP-labeled cells.RESULTS: Growth in the co-culture assay consistently reflected transformation states of the plated cells. Immortalized, but untransformed human astrocytes failed even to establish growth on confluent normal human astrocytes. In contrast, all malignant human glioma cell lines and transformed human astrocytes demonstrated various degrees of infiltration into the astrocytic bed. Irradiation failed to alter the invasiveness of U87, A172, and U373. A 1-Gy dose slightly reduced the invasiveness of U251 MG by 75% (p < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Neuman-Keuls), without reducing total cell numbers. Independently irradiating the human astrocytic bed did not alter the invasiveness of nonirradiated U251, whereas the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001 reduced U251 invasiveness in the co-culture assay.CONCLUSIONS: Growth in the co-culture assay reflects the transformation status and provides a useful in vitro model for assessing invasiveness. Human glioma invasiveness in the co-culture model responds variably to single low-dose fractions. MMP activity promotes invasiveness in the co-culture model. Reduced invasiveness in irradiated U251 appears to be mediated by MMP-independent mechanisms.",Included

A single institution, prospective, randomized trial was performed in terminal cancer patients to compare tropisetron (TRO), metoclopramide (MET), and chlorpromazine (CHL) in the management of nausea and emesis. Patients had far advanced cancer, were far removed from chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and their nausea and emesis was not due to bowel obstruction, drug intake, or cranial, electrolytic, or metabolic causes. The effects of antiemetic treatments were evaluated from Days 1-15. METHODS. Two hundred and eighty patients were randomized to receive 1) MET+ dexamethasone (DEX) (10 mg*4 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 2) TRO (5 mg*l, orally), 3) TRO + MET (5 mg*l and 10 mg*2, respectively, orally), 4) TRO + MET + DEX (5 mg*l, 10 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 5) CHL + DEX (25 mg*2 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 6) TRO + CHL (5 mg*l and 12.5 mg*2, respectively, orally), or 7) TRO + CHL + DEX (5 mg*l, 12.5 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally). Total control was defined as no nausea or emesis. RESULTS. By the end of the 15th day, total control of emesis was obtained in 23.6% (9 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 78.9% (30 of 38) of TRO patients, 84.2% (32 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 92.3% (36 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 33.3 (13 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 84.6% (33 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 92.5% (37 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. Total control of nausea was achieved in 18.4% (7 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 65.7% (25 of 38) of TRO patients, 73.6% (28 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 87.1% (34 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 17.9% (7 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 74.3% (29 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 85% (34 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients.

Dosimetry was done with thermoluminescence dosimeters. The highest dose on the patient's head was recorded as the maximum entrance skin dose. The equivalent dose was obtained by conversion of the dose-area product using published conversion tables.RESULTS: The maximum entrance skin dose varied from 129 to 1335 mGy. The mean effective dose was 1.67 mSv with a range of 0.44 to 3.44 mSv. No deterministic effect has been encountered. Stochastic risk linked to the highest effective dose value was approximately one death by fatal cancer for every 6000 procedures, according to the new International Commission on Radiological Protection coefficient.CONCLUSIONS: Because no deterministic effect has been detected, and stochastic risks were very low, radiation hazard to the patient is a minor consideration in deciding whether to undertake a neurointerventional procedure.",Excluded

The extent of airway contractions increased with higher frequencies. Stable repeated airway contractions were obtained at a frequency of 50 Hz, a width of 1 ms, and an output of 200 mA for 2.5 s each minute. Larger airways showed stronger responses. The EFS-triggered contractions were increased by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor neostigmine (10 muM) and reversed by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 muM), whereas the thromboxane protanoid receptor antagonist SQ29548 (10 muM) had no effect. Magnesium ions (10 mM) antagonized airway contractions induced by EFS, but not by methacholine, indicating that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS. Our data further show that the electrically evoked airway contractions in PCLS are mediated by cholinergic nerves, independent of thromboxane and more prominent in larger airways. Taken together these findings show that nerve endings remain intact in PCLS, and they suggest that the present method is useful to study neurogenic responses in airways of different size.

The renewable energy systems have low efficiency and intermittent nature due to unpredictable meteorological conditions. The domestic load and the conventional charging stations behave in an uncertain manner. To operate the renewable energy sources efficiently for harvesting maximum power, instantaneous nonlinear dynamics should be captured online. A Chebyshev-wavelet embedded NeuroFuzzy indirect adaptive MPPT (maximum power point tracking) control paradigm is proposed for variable speed wind turbine-permanent synchronous generator (VSWT-PMSG). A Hermite-wavelet incorporated NeuroFuzzy indirect adaptive MPPT control strategy for photovoltaic (PV) system to extract maximum power and indirect adaptive tracking control scheme for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) is developed. A comprehensive simulation test-bed for a grid-connected hybrid power system is developed in Matlab/Simulink. The robustness of the suggested indirect adaptive control paradigms are evaluated through simulation results in a grid-connected hybrid power system test-bed by comparison with conventional and intelligent control techniques. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control paradigms. Copyright © 2017 Mumtaz et al.

816,"Fate of the multiple innervation of cerebellar Purkinje cells by climbing fibers in immature control, x-irradiated and hypothyroid rats The fate of the multiple innervation of Purkinje cells (PCs) by climbing fibers (CFs) was studied as a function of age in immature rats rendered agranular by X-irradiation, in immature hypothyroid rats, and compared to that in controls. This was done by examining in each group the intracellular activities of PCs mediated via CFs throughout maturation. From the third day in control rats, CF responses of PCs evoked by juxta fastigial region (JF) stimulation or occurring spontaneously already resembled the adult responses with, however, some important differences: (1) most of these responses were graded by steps with the intensity of the stimulation before day 13, due to the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs (see below); (2) immature CF responses exhibited a longer duration and their initial spike started near the peak of the EPSP instead of near the baseline later on. Finally, an anlage of CF response was already present in most PCs on day 2, and consisted of a single fast spike elicited near the peak of an underlying all-or-none EPSP. In the 3 groups of rats, CF EPSPs already closely resembled the adult ones as early as 3 days, although their total duration and especially their time to peak were longer. In control rats, these CF EPSPs reversed with depolarizing currents from day 3 and currents for reversal were much lower than in the adult. 'Dual' CF EPSPs of PCS37 were encountered in immature 7- to 10-day-old controls, and persisted in hypothyroid rats until the end of the third postnatal week. The mono- or the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was ascertained in th 3 groups according to the graded or the all-or-none character of CF EPSPs, and the number of CFs impinging on a given PC was estimated by the number of steps in the response. In control rats, most of PCs were already multiply innervated by CFs as early as 3 days. The multiple innervation culminated on day 5 with an average number of 3.4 CFs for PC, and rapidly regressed later on, so that the adult-type monoinnervation was the rule after day 13. In hypothyroid rats, the establishment of the redundancy and its regression was delayed by 2--3 days. In X-irradiated rats, the settlement and the involution of the multiple innervation of PCs by CFs was exactly superimposed with that seen in controls until day 8. Later on, regression of the supernumerary contacts no longer occurred so that most PCs remained multiply innervated until adulthood. Finally, the first clear-cut IPSPs were detected in PCs on day 9 in control and X-irradiated rats and 2--3 days later in hypothyroid animals.",Excluded
2259,"A pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein mediates the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor inhibition of melatonin release in photoreceptive chick pineal cell cultures The avian pineal gland is a photoreceptive organ that has been shown to contain postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors that inhibit melatonin synthesis and/or release upon receptor activation. Physiological response and [32P]ADP ribosylation experiments were performed to investigate whether pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) were involved in the transduction of the alpha 2-adrenergic signal. For physiological response studies, the effects of pertussis toxin on melatonin release in dissociated cell cultures exposed to norepinephrine were assessed. Pertussis toxin blocked alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin-induced blockade appeared to be noncompetitive. One and 10 ng/ml doses of pertussis toxin partially blocked and a 100 ng/ml dose completely blocked norepinephrine-induced inhibition. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP ribosylation of G-proteins in chick pineal cell membranes was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Membranes were prepared from cells that had been pretreated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin. In the absence of pertussis toxin pretreatment, two major proteins of 40K and 41K mol wt (Mr) were labeled by [32P]NAD. Pertussis toxin pretreatment of pineal cells abolished [32P] radiolabeling of the 40K Mr G-protein in a dose-dependent manner. The norepinephrine-induced inhibition of both cAMP efflux and melatonin release, as assessed by RIA of medium samples collected before membrane preparation, was also blocked in a dose-dependent manner by pertussis toxin. Collectively, these results suggest that a pertussis toxin-sensitive 40K Mr G-protein labeled by [32P]NAD may be functionally associated with alpha 2-adrenergic signal transduction in chick pineal cells.",Excluded

Here we describe clinically relevant analyses for D + EP vs EP based on PD-L1 expression, progression patterns and PROs. Method(s): Tx-naive ES-SCLC (WHO PS 0/1) pts received 4 cycles of EP plus D q3w followed by maintenance D q4w or up to 6 cycles of EP q3w + prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI; investigator's discretion). PD-L1 expression in optional archival tissue was tested by VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) immunohistochemistry assay. PROs were assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30/LC13 with changes from baseline analysed by time to deterioration (TTD) per Cox proportional hazards. Result(s): As of 11 March 2019, 265 and 266 pts had received D + EP and EP, respectively. Of 277 with evaluable samples (D + EP, 151; EP, 126), PD-L1 expression was low (5% and 22% of pts with expression >=1% in tumour (TC) and immune cells (IC), respectively). Evaluating PD-L1 expression as a continuous variable in either TC or IC indicated no significant impact of PD-L1 on Tx effect between arms for OS (P = 0.54 and 0.23, respectively); nor for PFS and ORR. Progression patterns were similar, although fewer pts developed new lesions at first progression with D + EP vs EP (41.4% vs 47.2%), including lung lesions (8.6% vs 15.2%). The incidence of new brain/CNS metastases was similar between arms (11.6% vs 11.5%), despite PCI allowance in the control arm only. Baseline PRO scores were comparable across all symptoms and functional domains. TTD was longer across all PROs for D + EP (favourable HRs, many with upper 95% CIs <1; Table 1). [Table presented] Conclusion(s): D + EP provided significant OS benefit over EP alone, while preserving QoL and increasing the time to worsening of symptoms and functioning. PD-L1 expression was low and did not appear to be a predictive biomarker for D + EP. Clinical trial identification: NCT03043872 (release date: February 6, 2017).

3435,"Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Patients with Surgically Resected Small Cell Lung Cancer INTRODUCTION: Data on prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) after complete resection of SCLC are limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of PCI in this population.METHODS: We retrospectively identified completely resected SCLC at the Shanghai Chest Hospital between January 2006 and January 2014.RESULTS: A total of 349 patients (115 patients who received PCI [the PCI-treated cohort] and 234 patients who did not [the non-PCI-treated cohort]) were included in the study. The results demonstrated that the PCI-treated cohort had longer overall survival than the non-PCI-treated cohort among patients with pathologic stage (p-stage) II (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.99, p = 0.047) and p-stage III (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86, p = 0.009) disease. Among patients with p-stage III disease, there was a significantly higher risk for cerebral recurrence from the time of diagnosis in the non-PCI-treated cohort (p = 0.018). With regard to patients with p-stage I disease, neither overall survival benefit (HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 0.68-3.83, p = 0.282) nor risk for cerebral recurrence (p = 0.389) was significant between the PCI-treated and non-PCI-treated cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in the current study support using PCI in patients with p-stage II/III disease but not in patients with p-stage I disease. A relatively lower risk for brain metastases in p-stage I patients might explain the inferior efficacy of PCI in this population.",Included
2781,"Prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen treatment and rat spinal cord re-irradiation Normal tissue injury may lead to severe, life threatening, late side effects after therapeutic use of irradiation. Neurological complications caused by radiation of the spinal cord are ascribed to progressive, irreversible damage to the vasculature. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is known to induce angiogenesis in irradiated tissue and has been proven to reduce late radiation injury in several normal tissues when applied during the latent period before complications become manifest. In the present study: (1) the prophylactic potential of HBO; (2) optimal timing of HBO therapy after spinal cord irradiation, i.e. during the latent period; and (3) effect of HBO on the re-irradiation tolerance of the spinal cord were investigated. The rat cervical spinal cord was locally X-ray irradiated with ten fractions of 6.5 Gy in 11 days. Five treatment groups (n=10) included: irradiation alone and irradiation followed by 30 HBO treatments (100% oxygen at 240 kPa for 90 min) during latency, with HBO starting either immediately, 5, 10 or 15 weeks after the primary irradiation course. One year after the primary treatment, the same spinal cord volume was re-irradiated with 20 Gy single dose. During life span, the animals were observed on the incidence of myelitis and the duration of the latent period. The actuarial analysis revealed no significant difference in neurological complications free survival between the irradiation alone and the irradiation+HBO treatment groups. A tendency towards radiosensitization was found in the group in which the primary irradiation course was immediately followed by the HBO treatment course. The data show that HBO applied during the latent period of progressively developing irradiation damage to the spinal cord does not increase the re-irradiation tolerance of this tissue. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

964,"Selenium content and distribution in rat tissues irradiated with gamma rays The effects of supplementation with selenous yeast and ionizing radiation on selenium (Se) content and distribution were evaluated in rat tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, heart, muscle, blood, front brain, hind brain, hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal glands, testes, and hair). This study had 16 Se-supplemented (0.5 micrograms Se/d) and 16 placebo adult male Wistar rats. One half of the animals (eight Se-supplemented and eight placebos) were irradiated with a single dose of 4.2 Gy from a Co-60 source and sacrificed 7 d after irradiation along with nonirradiated animals and analyzed for Se content determination. The data obtained showed that selenous yeast supplementation increased Se levels in rat tissues (highest increases in hypothalamus, 161%; hind brain, 126%; spleen, 110%; and adrenal gland, 105%). Ionizing radiation induced significant changes in Se content and distribution (decrease in liver, blood, hair, femoral muscle, spleen, and hypothalamus; increase in kidney, testes, adrenal glands, and brain of placebo group). Supplementation with selenous yeast reduces changes in Se content and distribution after irradiation. It seems that the animal tissue susceptibility to oxidative damage may be correlated to their ability to retain Se in tissues.",Included
888,"X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of two-component heterokaryons of Neurospora crassa. VIII. Dose-dependence of the overall spectrum There is considerable controversy in the literature concerning the nature of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in various experimental organisms. To investigate this problem in Neurospora crassa a series of experiments (Webber and de Serres, 1965) was performed to study the induction-kinetics of X-ray-induced mutation in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region of a two-component heterokaryon (H-12). Subsequent genetic analyses (de Serres, 1989a,b,c, 1990a), on a series of 832 mutants recovered in these experiments, have shown that 3 different classes of ad-3 mutants were recovered, namely gene/point mutations, multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations. Complementation studies with a series of genetic markers that define 21 genetic loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent genetic regions have shown that ad-3 mutants classified as multilocus deletions result from the inactivation of a series of loci in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions of Linkage Group I, whereas multiple-locus mutations result from combinations of gene/point mutations and multilocus deletions. Analysis of the induction kinetics of these 3 different classes, after completion of the genetic characterization of all mutants (de Serres, 1990b) demonstrated that gene/point mutations increase linearly with X-ray dose, whereas multilocus deletions and multiple-site mutations increase as the square of X-ray dose. Further analysis of allelic complementation among the gene/point mutations at the ad-3B locus (de Serres, 1990c), demonstrated that the spectrum of complementation patterns was dose-dependent: complementing mutants with nonpolarized patterns decreased and noncomplementing mutations increased with increasing X-ray dose. There was little or no change with dose in the frequency of mutants with polarized patterns. In the present report, data from studies published previously have been utilized, along with additional data from the original X-ray experiments (12-5, 12-6, 12-7, and 12-10; see Webber and de Serres, 1965) to develop composite complementation maps of the X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 and immediately adjacent regions as a function of X-ray dose. This analysis of the overall spectrum of X-ray-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region demonstrated marked dose-dependence and provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature with regard to specific-locus studies in different experimental organisms.",Excluded
2190,"Helium CT: Monte Carlo simulation results for an ideal source and detector with comparison to proton CT Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of relative stopping power and spatial resolution of images reconstructed with simulated helium CT (HeCT) in comparison to proton CT (pCT). Method(s): A Monte Carlo (MC) study with the TOPAS tool was performed to compare the accuracy of relative stopping power (RSP) reconstruction and spatial resolution of low-fluence HeCT to pCT, both using 200 MeV/u particles. An ideal setup consisting of a flat beam source and a totally absorbing energy-range detector was implemented to estimate the theoretically best achievable RSP accuracy for the calibration and reconstruction methods currently used for pCT. The phantoms imaged included a cylindrical water phantom with inserts of different materials, sizes, and positions, a Catphan phantom with a module containing high-contrast line pairs (CTP528) and a module with cylindrical inserts of different RSP (CTP404), as well as a voxelized 10-year-old female phantom. Dose to the cylindrical water phantom was also calculated. The RSP accuracy was studied for all phantoms except the CTP528 module. The latter was used for the estimation of the spatial resolution, evaluated as the modulation transfer function (MTF) at 10%. Result(s): An overall error under 0.5% was achieved for HeCT for the water phantoms with the different inserts, in all cases better than that for pCT, in some cases by a factor 3. The inserts in the CTP404 module were reconstructed with an average RSP accuracy of 0.3% for HeCT and 0.2% for pCT. Anatomic structures (brain, bones, air cavities, etc.) in the digitized head phantom were well recognizable and no artifacts were visible with both HeCT and pCT. The three main tissue materials (soft tissue, brain, and cranium) were well identifiable in the reconstructed RSP-volume distribution with both imaging modalities. Using 360 projection angles, the spatial resolution was 4 lp/cm for HeCT and 3 lp/cm for pCT. Generally, spatial resolution increased with the number of projection angles and was always higher for HeCT than for pCT for the same number of projections. When HeCT and pCT scan were performed to deliver the same dose in the phantom, the resolution for HeCT was higher than pCT. Conclusion(s): MC simulations were used to compare HeCT and pCT image reconstruction. HeCT images had similar or better RSP accuracy and higher spatial resolution compared to pCT. Further investigation of the potential of helium ion imaging is warranted. Copyright © 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",Excluded

1466,"Space radiation-induced inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and memory impairment in mice: ameliorative potential of the melatonin metabolite, AFMK Evaluation of potential health effects from high energy charged particle radiation exposure during long duration space travel is important for the future of manned missions. Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. The present study reports on the protective effects of N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a melatonin metabolite, against high energy charged particle radiation-induced oxidative damage to the brain. We observed that radiation exposure (2.0 Gy of 500 MeV/nucleon (56)Fe beams, a ground-based model of space radiation) impaired the spatial memory of mice at later intervals without affecting the motor activities. AFMK pretreatment significantly ameliorated these neurobehavioral ailments. Radiation-induced changes in the population of immature and proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus were localized using anti-doublecortin (Dcx) and anti-Ki-67 expression. AFMK pretreatment significantly inhibited the loss of Dcx and Ki-67 positive cells. Moreover, AFMK pretreatment ameliorated the radiation-induced augmentation of protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde (MDA + HAE) in the brain and maintained the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and nonprotein sulfhydryl contents in brain.",Included
681,"Endogenous ATP involvement in mustard-oil-induced central sensitization in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (medullary dorsal horn) Central sensitization represents a sustained hypersensitive state of dorsal horn nociceptive neurons that can be evoked by peripheral inflammation or injury to nerves and tissues. It reflects neuroplastic changes such as increases in neuronal spontaneous activity, receptive field size, and responses to suprathreshold stimuli and a decrease in activation threshold. We recently demonstrated that purinergic receptor mechanisms in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc; medullary dorsal horn) are also involved in the initiation and maintenance of central sensitization in brain stem nociceptive neurons of trigeminal subnucleus oralis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether endogenous ATP is involved in the development of central sensitization in Vc itself. The experiments were carried out on urethan/alpha-chloralose anesthetized and immobilized rats. Single neurons were recorded and identified as nociceptive-specific (NS) in the deep laminae of Vc. During continuous saline superfusion (0.6 ml/h it) over the caudal medulla, Vc neuronal central sensitization was readily induced by mustard oil application to the tooth pulp. However, this mustard-oil-induced central sensitization could be completely blocked by continuous intrathecal superfusion of the wide-spectrum P2X receptor antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2, 4-disulphonic acid tetra-sodium (33-100 microM) and by apyrase (an ectonucleotidase enzyme, 30 units/ml). Superfusion of the selective P2X1, P2X3 and P2X(2/3) receptor antagonist 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (6-638 microM) partially blocked the Vc central sensitization. The two P2X receptor antagonists did not significantly affect the baseline nociceptive properties of the Vc neurons. These findings implicate endogenous ATP as an important mediator contributing to the development of central sensitization in nociceptive neurons of the deep laminae of the dorsal horn.",Excluded

1395,"A system for stereotactic radiosurgery with a linear accelerator A small field irradiation technique to deliver high doses of single fraction photon radiation to small, precisely located volumes (0.5 to 8 cm3) within the brain has been developed.

Target localization via planar angiography has been added. Treatment consists of a series of arcing beams using both gantry and couch rotations. During treatment, the patient's head is immobilized independently of the radiotherapy couch and is precisely positioned without reference to room lasers or light field. A precise verification of alignment precedes each treatment. Extensive performance tests have shown that a target, localized by CT, can be irradiated with a positional accuracy of 2.4 mm in any direction with 95% confidence. If angiography is used for localization, the results are better. The dose 1.0 cm outside the target volume is less than 20% of the prescribed dose for a medium sized collimator.",Excluded

2220,"Physics of surgery with lasers The characteristics of the principal lasers used in surgery are summarized in Table 1. Their diverse effects on biologic tissues permit the following generalizations: The CO2 laser is best suited for precise, visually controllable tissue removal by vaporization with minimal marginal damage. Hemostasis is excellent for bleeding from capillary vessels, but difficult for larger ones. The Nd:YAG laser is best suited for the coagulation of larger tissue volumes of the order of 10 mm3 or more. Tissue heating inherently extends for several millimeters, leading to excellent hemostasis. Radiation from this laser is well transmitted through flexible optical fibers and clear fluids. The argon ion laser emits radiation in the visible range and is ideally suited for treating the retina and other tissues in the eye without damage to its transparent structures. Radiation of this laser is strongly absorbed by pigmented tissues, scattered and reflected by others, and transmitted by fluids. Its radiation can be focused to very small spot sizes, leading to high precision and high-power densities. It has hemostatic properties intermediate between those of the CO2 and of the Nd:YAG laser radiations. It is well transmitted through optical fibers and clear fluids. It is used extensively in ophthalmology and dermatology. Selected applications to neurosurgery and otology are being investigated. These lasers have become indispensable adjuncts to the surgical armamentarium of several specialties. The very success of these lasers is leading to a critical examination of their shortcomings and to a search for improved systems. Examples are (1) the ongoing search for optical fibers to transmit the radiation of the CO2 laser; (2) the development of systems for the sequential delivery to tissues of several wavelengths from a single unit (Fig. 14); and (3) investigations of tissue effects of laser beams in the ultraviolet and in the infrared at wavelengths intermediate between those of the Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers. The use of lasers has already contributed to improved medical care in many surgical disciplines. Additional areas of application can be confidently anticipated.",Excluded
1722,"Toward improved target conformity for two spot scanning proton therapy delivery systems using dynamic collimation Purpose: To quantify improvement in target conformity in brain and head and neck tumor treatments resulting from the use of a dynamic collimation system (DCS) with two spot scanning proton therapy delivery systems (universal nozzle, UN, and dedicated nozzle, DN) with median spot sizes of 5.2 and 3.2 mm over a range of energies from 100 to 230 MeV. Method(s): Uncollimated and collimated plans were calculated with both UN and DN beam models implemented within our in-house treatment planning system for five brain and ten head and neck datasets in patients previously treated with spot scanning proton therapy. The prescription dose and beam angles from the clinical plans were used for both the UN and DN plans. The average reduction of the mean dose to the 10-mm ring surrounding the target between the uncollimated and collimated plans was calculated for the UN and the DN. Target conformity was analyzed using the mean dose to 1-mm thickness rings surrounding the target at increasing distances ranging from 1 to 10 mm. Result(s): The average reductions of the 10-mm ring mean dose for the UN and DN plans were 13.7% (95% CI: 11.6%-15.7%; p < 0.0001) and 11.5% (95% CI: 9.5%-13.5%; p < 0.0001) across all brain cases and 7.1% (95% CI: 4.4%-9.8%; p < 0.001) and 6.3% (95% CI: 3.7%-9.0%; p < 0.001), respectively, across all head and neck cases. The collimated UN plans were either more conformal (all brain cases and 60% of the head and neck cases) than or equivalent (40% of the head and neck cases) to the uncollimated DN plans. The collimated DN plans offered the highest conformity. Conclusion(s): The DCS added either to the UN or DN improved the target conformity. The DCS may be of particular interest for sites with UN systems looking for a more economical solution than upgrading the nozzle to improve the target conformity of their spot scanning proton therapy system.

3258,"Sex differences in neurochemical effects of dopaminergic drugs in rat striatum Previous data indicate that dopamine neurotransmission is differently regulated in male and female rats. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the dopamine transporter and autoreceptor as potential loci responsible for this sex difference. Fast cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes was used to monitor changes in electrically evoked levels of extracellular dopamine in the striata of anesthetized male and female rats before and after administration of an uptake inhibitor, a dopamine D2 antagonist, or a D3/D2 agonist. Administration of 40 mg/kg cocaine ip increased electrically-evoked extracellular dopamine concentrations in both sexes, but to a significantly greater extent in female striatum at the higher stimulation frequencies. The typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, increased dopamine efflux in both sexes but the effect was twice as large in the female striatum. The D3/D2 agonist quinpirole induced an unexpected, transient increase in dopamine efflux following high-frequency stimulation only in females, and evoked dopamine was higher in females across this entire time course. More detailed analysis of cocaine effects revealed no fundamental sex differences in the interaction of cocaine with DAT in vivo or in synaptosomes. These results indicate that nigrostriatal dopamine neurotransmission in the female rat is more tightly regulated by autoreceptor and transporter mechanisms, perhaps related by greater autoreceptor control of DAT activity. Thus, baseline sex differences in striatal dopamine regulation induce different pharmacologic responses. These results contribute to understanding sex differences in stimulant-induced locomotor activity in rats and may have broader implications for neurologic disorders and their pharmacotherapies in humans.",Excluded
3279,"Effect of Fiberoptic Collimation Technique on 808 nm Wavelength Laser Stimulation of Cochlear Neurons OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fiberoptic collimation technique on auditory neural stimulation in the cochlea with 808 nm wavelength lasers.BACKGROUND DATA: Recently, the pulsed near-infrared lasers in the 800-1000 nm wavelength range have been investigated as an emerging technique to trigger auditory neural response in the cochlea. A laser beam divergence in the optical stimulation pathway exists, which may affect stimulation efficiency and spatial selectivity.METHODS: The fiberoptic collimation technique was proposed for cochlear neuron stimulation, and the C-lens element was designed as the collimation structure. The spiral ganglion cells in deafened guinea pigs' cochlea were irradiated with collimated and uncollimated near-infrared lasers. Optically evoked auditory brainstem response (OABR) under the two laser output modes were recorded.RESULTS: Laser with the collimation technique evoked an average 58% higher OABR amplitude than the uncollimated laser output. In addition, the collimated laser setup consumed on average 35.2% of laser energy compared with the uncollimated laser when evoking the same OABR amplitude.CONCLUSIONS: The fiberoptic collimation technique improved stimulation efficiency and reduced stimulating energy consumption in near-infrared neural stimulation in cochlea. The positive effects of laser collimation technique could benefit further research in optically based cochlear implants.",Excluded
1683,"Phase II study of short-course radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide in elderly patients with glioblastoma PURPOSE: Radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy may prolong survival in older patients (age >=70 years) with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), although the survival benefits remain poor. This Phase II multicenter study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an abbreviated course of RT plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) in older patients with GBM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one eligible patients 70 years of age or older with newly diagnosed GBM and a Karnofsky performance status >=60 were treated with a short course of RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks) plus TMZ at the dosage of 75 mg/m(2) per day followed by 12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150-200 mg/m(2) for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and toxicity.RESULTS: The Median OS was 12.4 months, and the 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 58% and 20%, respectively. The median and 1-year rates of progression-free survival were 6 months and 20%, respectively. All patients completed the planned programme of RT. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 16 patients (22%). Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia occurred in 10 patients (15%), leading to the interruption of treatment in 6 patients (8%). Nonhematologic Grade 3 toxicity was rare, and included fatigue in 4 patients and cognitive disability in 1 patient.CONCLUSIONS: A combination of an abbreviated course of RT plus concomitant and adjuvant TMZ is well tolerated and may prolong survival in elderly patients with GBM. Future randomized studies need to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of different schedules of RT in association with chemotherapy.",Excluded
1032,"Quantities for assessing high photon doses to the body: a calculational approach Tissue reactions are the most clinically significant consequences of high-dose exposures to ionising radiation. However, currently there is no universally recognized dose quantity that can be used to assess and report generalised risks to individuals following whole body exposures in the high-dose range. In this work, a number of potential dose quantities are presented and discussed, with mathematical modelling techniques employed to compare them and explore when their differences are most or least manifest. The results are interpreted to propose the average (D <sub>GRB</sub>) of the absorbed doses to the stomach, small intestine, red bone marrow, and brain as the optimum quantity for informing assessments of risk. A second, maximally conservative dose quantity (D <sub>Max</sub>) is also suggested, which places limits on any under-estimates resulting from the adoption of D <sub>GRB</sub>. The primary aim of this work is to spark debate, with further work required to refine the final choice of quantity or quantities most appropriate for the full range of different potential exposure scenarios.",Excluded

612,"Evaluation of Peritumoral Edema in the Delineation of Radiotherapy Clinical Target Volumes for Glioblastoma Purpose: To evaluate the spatial relationship between peritumoral edema and recurrence pattern in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods and Materials: Forty-eight primary GBM patients received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy that did not intentionally include peritumoral edema within the clinical target volume between July 2000 and June 2001. All 48 patients have subsequently recurred, and their original treatment planning parameters were used for this study. New theoretical radiation treatment plans were created for the same 48 patients, based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) target delineation guidelines that specify inclusion of peritumoral edema. Target volume and recurrent tumor coverage, as well as percent volume of normal brain irradiated, were assessed for both methods of target delineation using dose-volume histograms. Result(s): A comparison between the location of recurrent tumor and peritumoral edema volumes from all 48 cases failed to show correlation by linear regression modeling (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.0007; p = 0.3). For patients with edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, the percent volume of brain irradiated to 46 Gy was significantly greater in treatment plans that intentionally included peritumoral edema compared with those that did not (38% vs. 31%; p = 0.003). The pattern of failure was identical between the two sets of plans (40 central, 3 in-field, 3 marginal, and 2 distant recurrence). Conclusion(s): Clinical target volume delineation based on a 2-cm margin rather than on peritumoral edema did not seem to alter the central pattern of failure for patients with GBM. For patients with peritumoral edema >75 cm<sup>3</sup>, using a constant 2-cm margin resulted in a smaller median percent volume of brain being irradiated to 30 Gy, 46 Gy, and 50 Gy compared with corresponding theoretical RTOG plans that deliberately included peritumoral edema. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Patients were 20 to 70 years of age and had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. The radiotherapy protocol consisted of whole-pelvis external beam radiotherapy and HDR-ICBT. The cumulative linear quadratic equivalent dose (EQD2) was 62 to 65 Gy prescribed at point A. Cisplatin was administered weekly at a dose of 40 mg/m(2) for 5 courses.RESULTS: Between March 2008 and January 2009, 72 patients from 25 institutions were enrolled, and 71 patients were eligible and evaluable for compliance and severe toxicity. The median age of the patients was 57 years (range, 32-70 years). Sixty-five patients (92%) received the planned 5 courses of chemotherapy. Four patients had cisplatin dose reduction according to the protocol. Radiotherapy was completed per protocol in 68 patients (96%). Median overall treatment time was 50 days (range, 37-66 days). The following grade 3 or 4 acute adverse events were observed: neutropenia in 31 patients (44%), anemia in 10 patients (14%), diarrhea in 4 patients (6%), and anorexia in 3 patients (4%).CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with HDR-ICBT and standard weekly delivery of cisplatin was feasible with acceptable toxicity in Japanese patients with cervical cancer.",Excluded

2041,"Alteration of Interneuron Immunoreactivity and Autophagic Activity in Rat Hippocampus after Single High-Dose Whole-Brain Irradiation The effects of high dose gamma radiation on brain tissue are poorly understood, with both limited and major changes reported. The present study compared the effects of gamma irradiation on the expression of interneuron markers within the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region with expression in control matched rats. This area was chosen for study because of its well-characterized circuitry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 60 Gy of whole brain gamma radiation and after 24 or 48 hours, the brains were removed, fixed and sectioned to quantitate expression of parvalbumin (PV), calbindin-D28K (CB), reelin, neuropeptide-Y (NPY), and somatostatin. All of these markers increased in expression over the first 48 hours, except NPY, which decreased. This provides novel information on changes in gene expression in the hippocampal interneurons following radiation. Staining for Beclin 1, a marker of autophagy, increased most strongly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased intracellular calcium follows irradiation, leading to an increased expression of calcium binding proteins. Increased autophagy occurs in the neurogenic zone of the dentate hilus, consistent with reduced effective neurogenesis after irradiation.",Included
2346,"Trends in radiotherapeutic management and outcomes in esophageal brain metastases Objective: To examine national practice patterns and survival outcomes in patients with brain metastases from an esophageal primary treated with intracranial radiation. Background(s): Brain metastasis from an esophageal primary are a rare occurrence, therefore clinical data regarding management and outcomes are limited. Intracranial radiotherapy in the form of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common treatment approaches in management of brain metastases, however the utilization patterns and efficacy of each technique in esophageal based brain metastasis are unknown. Design/Methods: We analyzed 289 stage IV esophageal cancer patients with documented brain metastasis treated with intracranial radiotherapy as reported by the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) between the years 2004-2014. The treatment arms included those receiving WBRT versus SRS. Univariable and multivariable analyses identified characteristics predictive of overall survival. Multivariable logistic regression identified co-variates associated with each treatment arm. Result(s): There were 230 patients in the WBRT group and 59 patients in the SRS group. With multivariable analysis, SRS receipt was an independent predictor of improved overall survival (HR=0.63, p=0.005) along with receipt of chemotherapy, lower comorbidity score, African American race, and absence of liver/bone metastases (p<0.01). Overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years for the WBRT was 17% and 4% (median OS: 4.5 months) compared to 32% and 12% (median OS: 6.9 months) for the SRS arm (p=0.004). Notably, patient age, tumor grade, histology, presence of lung metastasis, and sex were not associated with differences in OS. More recent treatment year was associated with receipt of SRS (p=0.03). Conclusion(s): In the largest known analysis of intracranial radiotherapy in esophageal brain metastases to date, receipt of SRS was associated with increased OS compared to WBRT. Given the limitations of a retrospective analysis, these findings require further investigation.",Excluded
3447,"A link between vascular damage and cognitive deficits after whole-brain radiation therapy for cancer: A clue to other types of dementia? Whole brain radiation therapy for the treatment of tumors can sometimes cause cognitive impairment. Memory deficits were noted in up to 50% of treated patients over a short period of several months. In addition, an increased rate of dementia in young patients has been noted over the longer term, i.e. years. A deficit in neurogenesis after irradiation has been postulated to be the main cause of cognitive decline in patients, but recent data on irradiation therapy for limited parts of the brain appear to indicate other possibilities. Irradiation can directly damage various types of cells other than neuronal stem cells. However, this paper will focus on injury to brain vasculature leading to cognitive decline since vessels represent a better therapeutic target for drug development than other cells in the brain because of the blood-brain barrier.",Excluded

The aggressiveness by isolation in mice has been often used as a means for a better understanding of disturbed behavior in human beings. We found that male ICR white Swiss mice exhibiting isolation-induced aggression became gradually calm and showed remarkably quiet behavior 7 to 10 days after whole body irradiation of very low-dose X-rays (5-15 cGy). Higher doses (25-35 cGy), however, could not induce such effects. We also obtained the data on brain biochemistry giving a further support for the above low-dose effects on the mouse behavior. Brain serotonin turnover which has been known to be related to aggressive behavior in 5 or 15 cGy irradiated mice was faster than in aggressive control animals.",Included
3150,"Attenuated pulse size, disorderly growth hormone and prolactin secretion with preserved nyctohemeral rhythm distinguish irradiated from surgically treated acromegaly patients BACKGROUND: Radiation induces time-dependent loss of anterior pituitary function, attributed to damage of the pituitary gland and hypothalamic centres. The development of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in irradiated acromegaly patients is not well defined.OBJECTIVE: Detailed analysis of spontaneous 24-h GH and prolactin (PRL) secretion in relation to other pituitary functions and serum IGF-I concentrations in an attempt to find criteria for GHD in acromegalic patients with a GH response < 3 microg/l during the insulin tolerance test (ITT).DESIGN: Plasma hormone profiles obtained by 10 min sampling for 24 h in postoperatively irradiated acromegalic patients, compared with patients cured by surgery only and matched healthy controls.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: University setting. Fifteen subjects in each group.OUTCOME MEASURES: GH and PRL secretory parameters quantified by deconvolution, cluster, cosinor and approximate entropy (ApEn) analyses, IGF-I concentrations.RESULTS: Irradiation attenuated pulsatile secretion of GH and PRL, but total PRL secretion was unchanged. GH and PRL secretory regularity were diminished. Circadian timing remained intact. Pulsatile GH secretion and IGF-I were correlated (R = 0.30, P = 0.04). Criteria of pulsatile GH secretion = 12 microg/l/24 h and ApEn = 0.800 separated 12 of 15 irradiated patients from all others.CONCLUSION: Irradiated acromegaly patients with a subnormal GH response to ITT have very limited spontaneous GH secretion, with specific attenuation of the size of GH bursts and a highly irregular pattern, but with retained diurnal properties. These patients are thus likely GH-deficient and might benefit from GH replacement.",Included
3564,"Penguin Suit and Fetal Position Finite Element Model to Prevent Low Back Pain in Spaceflight <b>BACKGROUND:</b> This study aimed to investigate the biomechanical effects of different interventions on astronauts lumbar intervertebral discs in a microgravity environment during spaceflight and in a gravity environment when the astronaut returns. <b>METHODS:</b> A finite element model of the L4L5 lumbar segment was developed with eight loading schemes representing different interventions. The loading schemes included no intervention, wearing a penguin suit, sleeping in a fetal position, wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position, reclining for 4 or 16 h/d, and maintaining upright posture for 4 or 16 h/d. <b>RESULTS:</b> Without intervention, the microgravity environment led to increased central pore pressure, radial displacement, and water content in the lumbar intervertebral disc. Wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position can reduce disc pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content to 0.156 MPa, 11.50 kPa, 0.538 mm, and 1.390%, respectively. When astronauts return to the gravity environment, staying upright for 4 h can reduce the pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content of the intervertebral disc to 0.222 MPa, 10.72 kPa, 0.373 mm, and 0.219%, respectively. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> This study showed that wearing a penguin suit and sleeping in the fetal position both have the potential to protect the lumbar intervertebral disc from the negative effects caused by microgravity. Remaining in the upright posture for 4 h per day may help squeeze out the water in the intervertebral disc safely when astronauts return to the gravity environment. <b>Zhang S, Wang K, Zhu R, Jiang C, Niu W.

2811,"Cholinergic responses in crossed tecto-reticular neurons of rat superior colliculus Neurons in the intermediate gray layer (SGI) of mammalian superior colliculus (SC) receive cholinergic innervation from the brain stem parabrachial region, which seems to modulate the signal processing in the SC. To clarify its role particularly in orienting behaviors, we studied cholinergic effects on the major output neuron group of the SGI, crossed tecto-reticular neurons (cTRNs), identified by retrograde labeling from the contralateral brain stem gaze center in SC slices obtained from rats (PND 17-22) by whole cell patch-clamp techniques. Bath application of carbachol induced either 1) nicotinic inward (nIN) + muscarinic inward (mIN) (11/24) or 2) nIN + mIN + muscarinic outward (mOUT) (13/24) current responses. Transient pressure application of 1 mM acetylcholine elicited nIN in all neurons tested (n = 58). In a majority of these neurons (52/58), the nIN was completely suppressed by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, a specific antagonist for alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor subtype. The remaining 6/58 neurons exhibited not only the slower alpha4beta2 receptor-mediated component but also a faster component that was inhibited by a specific antagonist for alpha7 nicotinic receptor, alpha-bungarotoxin. cTRNs expressing alpha7 nicotinic receptors tended to be smaller in size than those lacking alpha7 receptors. Bath application of muscarine induced two response patterns: mIN only (17/38) and mIN+ mOUT (21/38). The mIN and mOUT were mediated by M3 (plus M1) and M2 muscarinic receptors, respectively. These results suggest that a major response to cholinergic inputs to cTRNs is excitatory. This would indicate the facilitatory role of the brain stem cholinergic system in the execution of orienting behaviors including saccadic eye movements.",Excluded

Therefore, the treatment rationale is characterized by reduction of symptoms and inhibition of complications. Regarding reduction of pain, treatment of (impending) fractures, and spinal cord compression radiation is an important part of palliative treatment. In our retrospective study we report the effect of radiotherapy on reduction of pain, recalcification and the reduction of neurological symptoms and evaluate factors which have an impact on therapeutic outcome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1, Jan 1988 to 31, Dec 1998, 42 patients (19 women, 23 men; range of ages 46 to 85 years, median age 64.9 years) with 71 target volumes were irradiated (median dose 36 Gy, 2 to 3 Gy 5 times/week) because of symptomatic disease (67/71: osseous pain, 45/71: fractures/impending fractures, 13/71: spinal cord compression) (Tables 1 and 2). The median time from diagnosis to the first course of radiotherapy was 11.9 months (0.3 to 90 months). At the time of first irradiation, 5 and 37 patients were in tumor Stage II and III (Salmon/Durie), respectively. The median value of the Karnofsky performance was 70% (40 to 90%).RESULTS: During follow-up (at least 6 months) in 85% of target volumes complete and partial pain relief (measured by patients' perception and the use of analgetic medication) was achieved; recurrences were seen in 8.8%. In 26/56 (46.4%) lesions evaluable a recalcification was seen whereas 17.9% showed progressive disease (comparison of radiographs before and after radiation). In 22.3% of all lesions initially with impending fracture (4/18) radiotherapy failed because of fracture after treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Simultaneous chemotherapy and a Karnofsky performance > or = 70 had a significant impact on a positive response to treatment, respectively. Spinal cord compression symptoms were reduced in 7/13 (53.8%) of patients (scaled due to the classification by Findlay 1987). The median survival from diagnosis for the entire group was 34.9 months (7.5 to 119.3 months), after irradiation 13.1 months (0.2 to 105.3 months) (Figure 1).CONCLUSION: When adequately indicated radiotherapy has shown to be an effective palliative treatment. Taking under consideration that the results are retrospective we suppose that in multiple myeloma the local response to radiation is supported by a favorable performance status and simultaneous chemotherapy. Irradiation treatment does not change prognosis regarding overall survival.",Excluded
2088,"Decreasing temporal lobe dose with five-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy for treatment of pituitary macroadenomas PURPOSE: To compare temporal lobe dose delivered by three pituitary macroadenoma irradiation techniques: three-field three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), three-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (3F IMRT), and a proposed novel alternative of five-field IMRT (5F IMRT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Computed tomography-based external beam radiotherapy planning was performed for 15 pituitary macroadenoma patients treated at New York University between 2002 and 2007 using: 3D-CRT (two lateral, one midline superior anterior oblique [SAO] beams), 3F IMRT (same beam angles), and 5F IMRT (same beam angles with additional right SAO and left SAO beams). Prescription dose was 45 Gy. Target volumes were: gross tumor volume (GTV) = macroadenoma, clinical target volume (CTV) = GTV, and planning target volume = CTV + 0.5 cm. Structure contouring was performed by two radiation oncologists guided by an expert neuroradiologist.RESULTS: Five-field IMRT yielded significantly decreased temporal lobe dose delivery compared with 3D-CRT and 3F IMRT. Temporal lobe sparing with 5F IMRT was most pronounced at intermediate doses: mean V25Gy (% of total temporal lobe volume receiving >=25 Gy) of 13% vs. 28% vs. 29% for right temporal lobe and 14% vs. 29% vs. 30% for left temporal lobe for 5F IMRT, 3D-CRT, and 3F IMRT, respectively (p < 10(-7) for 5F IMRT vs. 3D-CRT and 5F IMRT vs. 3F IMRT). Five-field IMRT plans did not compromise target coverage, exceed normal tissue dose constraints, or increase estimated brain integral dose.CONCLUSIONS: Five-field IMRT irradiation technique results in a statistically significant decrease in the dose to the temporal lobes and may thus help prevent neurocognitive sequelae in irradiated pituitary macroadenoma patients.",Excluded
2148,"Implementation of the structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index as a quantitative evaluation tool for dose distribution error detection PURPOSE: To apply an imaging metric of the structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index to the radiotherapy dose verification field and evaluate its capability to reveal the different types of errors between two dose distributions.METHOD: The SSIM index consists of three sub-indices: luminance, contrast, and structure. Given two images, luminance analysis compares the local mean result, contrast analysis compares the local standard deviation, and the structure index represents the local Pearson correlation. Three test error patterns (absolute dose error, dose gradient error, and dose structure error) were designed to characterize the response of SSIM and its sub-indices and establish the correlation between the indices and different dose error types. After establishing the correlation, four radiotherapy plans (one MLC picket-fence test plan, one brain stereotactic radiotherapy plan, and two head-and-neck plans) were tested by computing each index and compared with the gamma analysis results to determine their similarities and differences.RESULTS: Among the three test error patterns, the luminance index decreased from 1 to 0.1 when the absolute dose agreement fell from 100% to 5%, the contrast index decreased from 1 to 0.36 when the dose gradient agreement fell from 100% to 10%, and the structure index decreased from 1 to 0.23 when the periodical dose pattern shifted (leading to a lower correlation). Thus, the luminance, contrast and structure index can detect the absolute dose error, gradient discrepancy, and dose structure error, respectively. For the four clinical cases, the sub-indices can reveal the type of error when gamma analysis only provided limited information.CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between the subcomponents of the SSIM index and the error types of the dose distribution were established. The SSIM index provides additional error information compared to that provided by gamma analysis.",Excluded
1017,"Chromosomal in-vitro radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in radiotherapy patients and AT-homozygotes BACKGROUND: We investigated the in-vitro radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes with a special FISH/CISS-technique.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1993 through April 1996, a total number of 52 cancer patients was enrolled in the study. The tumor sites in these patients were: breast (n = 41), lung (n = 4), head and neck (n = 3) as well as prostate, bladder, rectal cancer and Hodgkin's disease (each n = 1). Twenty-six of them were examined prior to planned radiotherapy (prospective group) and 26 after radiotherapy (retrospective group). Three additional individuals (without cancer or radiotherapy) with proven ataxia telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome, AT-homozygotes) were also investigated and their blood samples served as positive control for radiosensitivity. The clinical radiation response of normal tissue in radiotherapy patients was scored according to the WHO grading system for acute and according to the RTOG grading system for late effects. For to estimate the intrinsic radiosensitivity, blood samples were taken and irradiated in vitro with 0 (control) or 0.7 or 2 Gy with a 6 MV-linear accelerator, standard 48-hour lymphocyte cultures were prepared, chromosomes #1, #2 and #4 were simultaneously labeled with a FISH/CISS-technique and 200 to 1,000 metaphase spreads were scored for chromosomal aberrations. The radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes was expressed as the number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks per mitosis after 0.7 Gy or 2 Gy corrected for the 0-Gy control value.RESULTS: The frequency of chromosomal breaks/mitosis in the unirradiated control lymphocytes was 0.020 +/- 0.015 in prospective patients who had not yet received radiotherapy. It was significantly higher in retrospective patients (0.264 +/- 0.164 breaks/mitosis) as a result of the previous radiation exposure. The 3 AT-homozygotes showed also an increased number of spontaneous chromosomal breaks (0.084 +/- 0.016 breaks/mitosis), probably resulting from the chromosomal instability in this disease. This figure, however, was significantly lower than in retrospective patients. The number of radiation-induced breaks after in-vitro irradiation was comparable in lymphocytes of patients who showed no normal tissue reaction (n = 11) as compared to those with mild to moderate radiation reaction (n = 32, acute reactions Grade 1 to 2, late reactions Grade 0 to 2). In 9 patients with unexpected severe plus late Grade 3 to 4 reactions, however, a significantly higher number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks was measured; the highest number was observed in a patient with a radiation myelitis. The 3 AT-homozygotes showed, as expected, an extreme radiosensitivity of their lymphocytes. The number of breaks/mitosis after 0.7 Gy in vitro irradiation of lymphocytes was 0.103 +/- 0.059 in patients with no normal tissue radiation reaction (n = 11), 0.122 +/- 0.146 in the group with mild to moderate radiation reactions Grade 1 to 2 (n = 32), 0.359 + 0.226 in patients with unexpected Grade 3 to 4 normal tissue reactions (n = 9) and 0.550 +/- 0.243 in the 3 AT-homozygotes (p < 0.01, t-test). The difference in lymphocyte radiosensitivity between these 4 groups was also detected after in-vitro irradiation with 2 Gy (0.484 +/- 0.132 vs. 0.535 +/- 0.228 vs. 0.926 +/- 0.349 vs. 1.423 +/- 0.072).CONCLUSIONS: We found a significantly higher number of chromosomal breaks in lymphocytes of patients with severe or extreme radiation reaction of normal tissues as compared to patients with no or only mild to moderate radiation reactions. The radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in these radiosensitive patients was in the range between normal radiosensitivity and the radiosensitivity of AT-homozygotes. Detection of patients with severely enhanced intrinsic radiosensitivity might be possible with this method.",Included
1194,"Treatment of choroidal melanoma with I-125 plaque Purposes: To evaluate efficacy of I-125 episcleral plaque therapy in patients with ocular melanoma and determine survival, eventual visual acuity, and complications. Methods and Materials: Between July 1, 1984 and January 1, 1991, 144 patients with diagnosis of ocular melanoma were treated with high activity I-125 episcleral plaques. Tumor volumes ranged from 14 to 3449 mm<sup>3</sup>. Lesion size included small (n = 15; height < 5 mm, and/or largest basal diameter of 8-16 mm) and large (n = 45; height > 8 mm, and/or largest basal diameter > 16 mm). Apical doses ranged from 74.25 to 83.66 Gy with scleral doses ranging from 41 and 160 Gy. Follow-up has ranged from 25 to 90 months (Med = 46 months). Result(s): Ocular survival was noted in 130/144. Reasons for enucleation included progressive tumor growth (n = 4), extrascleral extension (n = 4), or blind/painful eye (n = 6), 94 patients developed complications which included cataract (n = 43), optic neuropathy (n = 12), neovascular glaucoma (n = 8) and retinopathies (n = 31). Visual acuity testing pre- episcleral plaque therapy revealed 102 patients with 20/200 vision; at last follow-up 59 patients demonstrated visual acuity testing of 20/200 or better. Conclusion(s): The use of episcleral I-125 plaque therapy allows for safe and effective therapy in patients with ocular melanoma of various size depending on location and probable visual acuity outcome. A total apical dose of 75 Gy give at 60-65 cGy/hour provides durable local control with acceptable complication rates.",Excluded
1489,"Simulated Microgravity and Low-Dose/Low-Dose-Rate Radiation Induces Oxidative Damage in the Mouse Brain Microgravity and radiation are stressors unique to the spaceflight environment that can have an impact on the central nervous system (CNS). These stressors could potentially lead to significant health risks to astronauts, both acutely during the course of a mission or chronically, leading to long-term, post-mission decrements in quality of life. The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to high concentrations of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids and low levels of antioxidant defenses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative damage in the brain cortex and hippocampus in a ground-based model for spaceflight, which includes prolonged unloading and low-dose radiation. Whole-body low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) gamma radiation using (57)Co plates (0.04 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) was delivered to 6 months old, mature, female C57BL/6 mice (n = 4-6/group) to simulate the radiation component. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Mice were hindlimb suspended and/or irradiated for 21 days. Brains were isolated 7 days or 9 months after irradiation and hindlimb unloading (HLU) for characterization of oxidative stress markers and microvessel changes. The level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein, an oxidative specific marker for lipid peroxidation, was significantly elevated in the cortex and hippocampus after LDR + HLU compared to controls (P < 0.05). The combination group also had the highest level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression compared to controls (P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the animals that received HLU only or combined LDR + HLU compared to control (P < 0.05). In addition, 9 months after LDR and HLU exposure, microvessel densities were the lowest in the combination group, compared to age-matched controls in the cortex (P < 0.05). Our data provide the first evidence that prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity and LDR radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers that may increase the likelihood of brain injury and reduced antioxidant defense. NOX2-containing nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH oxidase) may contribute to spaceflight environment-induced oxidative stress.",Included

1113,"Knowledge and Attitude Regarding Radiation Exposure Among Spine Surgeons in Latin America BACKGROUND: Spine surgeons are exposed to high amounts of radiation from fluoroscopic procedures during their lifetime. In this study, we evaluated spine surgeons' knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine surgery.METHODS: We developed a questionnaire including questions about surgeons' characteristics and knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine surgery. A survey was performed with the members of AOSpine Latin America. The main variables studied were specialty, years of experience, surgeon's position during fluoroscopy, and practices to reduce the patient's and surgeon's radiation exposure during surgery. The results were analyzed and compared among different specialties, levels of experience, and countries of origin.RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 371 members of AOSpine Latin America from different countries. The sample was mostly from orthopedic surgeons (57.1%) and surgeons in practice for longer than 10 years (54.2%). Thyroid lead protection was used by 64.2% of the spine surgeons, lead glasses by 20.2%, and lead gloves by 7%. A dosimeter badge was never or only rarely used by 75.7%. The correct answer for surgeon position during lateral lumbar fluoroscopy was reported by only one-third of the surgeons. The reported rate of thyroid protector use was higher in surgeons from Brazil and Colombia compared with surgeons from Mexico and Argentina (P < 0.001), whereas the use of pulsed-mode fluoroscopy was higher in Mexico and Argentina compared with Brazil and Colombia (P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts toward implementing educational programs in Latin America focused on safety strategies are needed to minimize intraoperative radiation exposure.",Excluded

[Chinese] To study the development of changes for Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and its mRNA in rats hippocampus after electromagnetic radiation. Rats were exposed to X-band high power microwave (X-HPM), S-band high power microwave (S-HPM) and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) radiation source respectively. The animal model of electromagnetic radiation was established. Western blot was used to detect the expression of RKIP, and RT-PCR was applied to detect the expression of RKIP mRNA. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 was measured with co-immunoprecipitation method, and the expression of cerebral choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) was measured by immunohistochemistry. The expression of RKIP significantly down-regulated at 6 h after radiation, and recovered at 1 d in group EMP, but the down-regulation continued during 1 approximately 7 d after radiation in the two microwave groups. The expression of RKIP mRNA changed wavily during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, which showed down-regulation at 6 h, and up-regulation at 3 d. The interaction of RKIP and Raf-1 decreased during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, most significantly at 7 d, and the two microwave groups were more significant. The expression of CHAT decreased continuously during 6 h approximately 7 d after radiation, and generally recovered on 14 d.

1377,"Identification of tumor precursor cells in the brains of primates with radiation-induced de novo glioblastoma multiforme The pathogenesis of de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is poorly understood and precursor cells are not known. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of GBM we analyzed brains from primates that developed de novo tumors ten years after whole brain radiation. Four animals had clinical and radiological evidence of GBM, and two animals had no evidence of GBM at the time of euthanization. Tumor precursor cells were identified diffusely scattered in the grossly normal white matter of all animals including two monkeys without evidence of GBM by MR-imaging or on autopsy examination. Tumor precursors demonstrated cellular atypia and mitoses, and were negative for tumor-associated markers GFAP, EGFR and p53. The cells were positive for Ki67 and N-CoR, the nuclear corepressor of astroglial differentiation. These results suggest that radiation-induced nuclear damage to neural stem cells or early astrocytic precursor cells can prevent normal differentiation and lead to tumor development. The findings provide insight into the tumorigenesis of de novo GBMs and suggest a new strategy for treatment of these lethal tumors by targeting both inactivation of N-CoR and inhibition of EGFR.",Included

We evaluated the expression of aBC in BM and pBC with eventual BM and its association with survival. Method(s): Under IRB approval (UNC/Duke), we established a clinically-annotated biobank from 78 pts: 51 BM and 38 pBC with eventual BM (11 were matched BC and BM pairs); 59 pts had complete treatment (tx) data. IHC subtype was assigned for BM and pBC: HR+ (hormone receptor)/HER2-, triple-negative (TN; ER-/PR-/HER2-), and HR+or-/HER2+. aBC expression was based on % of positively stained tumor cells: negative (0%), weak (<30%) and strong positive (30%). Overall survival (OS) and survival after BM were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test). Result(s): Median age was 50 yrs (26-84). 67% were Caucasian, 32% African American. 90% received systemic tx for metastatic BC, of which 67% followed BM. 90% received local tx (resection and/or radiation) for BM. There was no difference in receipt of local or systemic tx by aBC. Subtype for pBC (n=36) was 31% (HR+/HER2-), 42% (TN), and 28% (HR+or-/HER2+); for BM (n=42) 33%, 43% and 24%, respectively. aBC was expressed in 37% (14/38) of pBC and 47% (24/51) of BM. Concordance of aBC expression between pBC and BM was 55% (6/11). Gain of aBC expression (4/11) was more common in BM than loss (1/11). aBC was more commonly expressed in TNBC (pBC 73%; BM 67%) compared to HR+/HER2- (pBC 9%; 29% BM) or HR+or-/HER2+ (pBC 0%; 30% BM). OS and survival after BM differed by subtype (all p<0.02); pts with TNBC experienced the poorest outcome.

3456,"Preventive and curative effects of radon inhalation on chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain in mice BACKGROUND: Radon therapy is clinically useful for the treatment of pain-related diseases. However, there have been no studies regarding the effects of radon inhalation on neuropathic pain. In this study, we aimed to determine whether radon inhalation actually induced a remission of neuropathic pain and improved the quality of life.METHODS: First, we investigated the antinociceptive effects of radon inhalation in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. We evaluated pain behaviour in mice before and after CCI surgery, using von Frey test. Pretreated mice received CCI surgery immediately after 24-h inhalation of radon at background (BG) concentration (c. 19 Bq/m(3) ), or at a concentration of 1000 or 2000 Bq/m(3) , and post-treated mice inhaled similar levels of radon 2 days after CCI surgery.RESULTS: CCI surgery induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia on a plantar surface of mice, as assessed using von Frey test, and 2000 Bq/m(3) radon inhalation alleviated hyperalgesic conditions 22-37% compared to BG level concentration. Concurrently, CCI surgery increased norepinephrine (NE), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in plasma, and leukocyte migration in paws. Furthermore, CCI-induced neuropathy reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Treatment with radon inhalation, specifically at a concentration of 2000 Bq/m(3) , produced antinociceptive effects, i.e., lowered plasma TNF-alpha, NE and NO levels and restored SOD activity, as well as pain-related behaviour.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that inhalation of 2000 Bq/m(3) radon prevented and alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain in mice.",Excluded

Central nervous system involvement usually confers a poor prognosis and requires emergent treatment. Standard of care still involves systemic therapy, intrathecal administration of chemotherapeutic agents, and cranial radiation. Treatment-related side effects can occur and need to be recognized by any practitioner involved with patient care.

861,"A radical approach to cancer Reactive oxygen species are known to be potentially dangerous, but are also needed for signal-transduction pathways. Tumor cells have relatively low amounts of superoxide dismutase (SOD), which quenches superoxide anion (O2(-*)), and as a result of a higher level of aerobic metabolism, higher concentrations of O2(-*) , compared to normal cells. But this may not be true of all tumor cells. Some tumor cells have relatively higher amounts of vitamin E, a potent anti-oxidant, and a higher level of anaerobic metabolism, resulting in a balance that is tilted more towards higher anti-oxidant capacity. In both instances of higher aerobic and anaerobic metabolism methods designed to augment free radical generation in tumor cells can cause their death. It is suggested that free radicals and lipid peroxides suppress the expression of Bcl-2, activate caspases and shorten telomere, and thus inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. Ionizing radiation, anthracyclines, bleomycin and cytokines produce free radicals and thus are useful as anti-cancer agents. But they also produce many side-effects. 2-methoxyoestradiol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit SODs and cause an increase of O2(-*) in tumor cells leading to their death. In addition, PUFAs (especially gamma-linolenic acid), 2-methoxyoestradiol and thalidomide may possess anti-angiogenic activity. This suggests that free radicals can suppress angiogenesis. Limited clinical studies done with gamma-linolenic acid showed that it can regress human brain gliomas without any significant side-effects. Thus, PUFAs, thalidomide and 2-methoxyoestradiol or their derivatives may offer a new radical approach to the treatment of cancer. [References: 173]",Excluded

78,"Intensity modulated radiation therapy for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity: preliminary results PURPOSE: To report preliminary results on using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as an adjuvant treatment in primary soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the extremity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 2002 and March 2005, 31 adult patients with primary STS of the extremity were treated with surgery and adjuvant IMRT. Tumor size was >10 cm in 74% of patients and grade was high in 77%. Preoperative IMRT was given to 7 patients (50 Gy) and postoperative IMRT (median dose, 63 Gy) was given to 24 patients. Complete gross resection including periosteal stripping or bone resection was required in 10, and neurolysis or nerve resection in 20. The margins were positive or within 1 mm in 17. Complications from surgery and radiation therapy (RT) were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system.RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 23 months. Grade 1 RT dermatitis developed in 71% of patients, Grade 2 in 16%, and Grade 3 in 10%. Infectious wound complications developed in 13% and noninfectious complications in 10%. Two patients (6.4%) developed fractures. Grade 1 neuropathy developed in 28% of patients and Grade 2 in 5%. The rates of Grade 1 and 2 joint stiffness were each 19%.

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of surgically treated PCMs larger than 2 cm.METHODS: A series of 199 consecutive patients (137 females, 68.8 %) with PCMs larger than 2 cm from between 1993 and 2003 were included. The clinical charts, radiographs, and follow-ups were evaluated.RESULTS: Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 111 (55.8 %) patients, subtotal resection (STR) in 65, and partial resection (PR) in 23. Cranial nerve dysfunctions were the most common complications and occurred in 133 (66.8 %) cases. The surgical mortality was 2.0 %. The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores significantly decreased 1 month after the operations (preoperative KPS = 76.8 and postoperative KPS = 64.8; p = 0.011, Paired-samples t test). Long-term follow-ups were obtained in 142 patients, the follow-up duration was 171.6 months, and the most recent KPS was 83.2. Permanent morbidities remained in 24 patients (18.9 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that brainstem edema and tumors larger than 4 cm in diameter were independent risk factors in terms of outcomes (KPS < 80). The recurrence/progression rates were 14.5, 31.8, and 53.3 % for the GTR, STR, and PR cases, respectively (p = 0.002, Pearson chi (2) test). Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the remnants exhibited good tumor control.CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes and low mortality were achieved with the microsurgical management of medium and large PCMs; however, the rates of cranial nerves dysfunction remained high. Radically aggressive resection might not be judicious in terms of postoperative morbidity. The preoperative evaluations and intraoperative findings were informative regarding the outcomes. The low follow-up rate likely compromised our findings, and additional consecutive studies were required.",Excluded

One of the most common measures of executive function in humans is the ability to perform attentional set shifting, which requires contributions from working memory, discrimination, reversal learning, attentional set shifting and attention. Rodent attentional set shifting assays require rats to form an association between the presence of the food reward and an associative cue, which is either the digging media or the scent that is placed in the bowl; by altering the combination of scent and digging media, progressively more complex cognitive processes can be tested. In this study, we have determined the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy of 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si particles has on the ability of male retired breeder Wistar rats to perform attentional set shifting at three months postirradiation. All doses of Si resulted in a significant impairment in the ability of the rats to perform the first and most simple step of the ATSET assay, the simple discrimination (SD) task. If astronauts were to experience HZE-induced SD impairments, they would be unable to identify key factors to successfully resolve a situation. Performance in at least one other component of the ATSET test was impaired at all doses studied, however, these varied according to the dose. Compared with our previous studies using 1 GeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe and <sup>48</sup>Ti particles, 600 MeV/n <sup>28</sup>Si ions impaired attentional set-shifting performance at lower doses than the heavier ions. However, when the effect of isofluences of the three HZE ions were compared, there were no significant differences in the severity of the impaired performance; there were, however, ion-specific decrements in the ability of rats to perform within the various stages of the test. This study further supports the notion that ""mission-relevant"" doses of HZE particles (<20 cGy) can impair certain aspects of attentional set-shifting performance in retired breeder rats, but there may be some ion-specific changes in the specific cognitive domains impaired.",Included

CD16+ and CD20+ lymphocytes, after an initial decrease, increased above baseline. TBI was also associated with decreased anti-AChR antibody titer. The decrease of lymphocyte count and of anti-AChR antibody titer was more pronounced in the patients who improved, suggesting that lymphopenia and immunosuppression may have contributed to clinical improvement.",Excluded
174,"Neuronal precursors within the adult rat subventricular zone differentiate into dopaminergic neurons after substantia nigra lesion and chromaffin cell transplant Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain continues in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Neuronal precursors from the SVZ migrate along the rostral migratory stream to replace olfactory bulb interneurons. After the destruction of the nigro-striatal pathway (SN-lesion), some SVZ precursors begin to express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuronal markers (NeuN). Grafting of chromaffin cells (CCs) into the denervated striatum increases the number of TH+ cells (SVZ TH+ cells; Arias-Carrion et al., 2004). This study examines the functional properties of these newly differentiating TH+ cells. Under whole-cell patch-clamp, most SVZ cells recorded from lesioned and grafted animals (either TH+ or TH-) were non-excitable. Nevertheless, a small percentage of SVZ TH+ cells had the electrophysiologic phenotype of mature dopaminergic neurons and showed spontaneous postsynaptic potentials. Dopamine (DA) release was measured in SVZ and striatum from both control and SN-lesioned rats. As expected, 12 weeks after SN lesion, DA release decreased drastically. Nevertheless, 8 weeks after CCs graft, release from the SVZ of SN-lesioned rats recovered, and even surpassed that from control SVZ, suggesting that newly formed SVZ TH+ cells release DA. This study shows for the first time that in response to SN-lesions and CC grafts neural precursors within the SVZ change their developmental program, by not only expressing TH, but more importantly by acquiring excitable properties of mature dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, the release of DA in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and the attraction of synaptic afferents from neighboring neuronal networks gives further significance to the overall findings, whose potential importance is discussed.",Excluded
1821,"Single domain antibody (SBT-100) crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and inhibits human glioblastoma by selectively targeting KRAS and P-STAT3 Background: Glioblastoma is difficult to treat malignancy that has a high incidence of KRAS mutations ( > 90%) and hyper-expression of P-STAT3 ( > 90%). Most chemotherapeutic agents and large biologics (four chain heterotetrameric IgG) cannot cross the BBB. Therefore Singh Biotechnology's (SBT) propriety technology has developed a novel targeted therapy and engineered SBT-100 a 15 kD single domain antibody (sdAb) that is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3, which can cross the BBB to target gliablastomas. Method(s): Human glioblastoma (U87MG) cell line was used and obtained from ATCC. Biacore affinity assay was used to demonstrate SBT-100 binding to KRAS, KRAS (G12D), and STAT3. The glioblastoma cells were incubated with 0ug/ml to 200ug/ml of SBT-100. MTT assay was performed after 3 days of treatment with SBT-100 and the growth inhibition was calculated. Xenograft (athymic nude mouse) with a well established tumor growing for 6 weeks was injected with SBT-100 intraperitoneally (IP). After 15 minutes the brain of this animal was harvested for immunohistochemical staining. Result(s): Biacore studies showed SBT-100 binds KRAS with affinity constant of 10- 9M, KRAS (G12D) at 10- 8M, and STAT3 at 10- 8M. MTT assay reveals 62% (p < 0.01) growth inhibition of U87MG within 3 days. A xenograft mouse with a well established tumor ( > 150mm<sup>3</sup>), when injected IP with 5mg/kg of SBT-100 showed localization in the brain within 15 minutes. Therefore SBT-100 (sdAb) crosses the BBB, and shows intracellular localization in the animal's neurons and glial cells. Conclusion(s): SBT-100 significantly inhibits the growth of glioblastoma. KRAS mutations and/or over expression of P-STAT3 in glioblastomas are promising targets for sdAbs like SBT-100, which is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3. SBT-100 crosses the BBB and localizes within the neurons and glial cells of the brain. SBT's proprietary single domain antibody technology platform used to engineer SBT- 100 holds promise for targeting primary brain malignancies, metastatic cancers that go to the brain, and for neurologic disease amenable to targeted therapy.

3069,"A novel TNFRSF member, TROY (TNFRSF19), is upregulated in glioblastoma and mediates glioblastoma cell invasion and survival Glioblastoma (GB) is the most malignant form of all primary adult brain tumors. Of the features that characterize GB, arguably none is more clinically significant than the propensity of glioma cells to aggressively invade the surrounding normal brain tissue. These invasive cells render complete resection impossible and confer resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. To improve treatment of malignant glioma, we must find a way to stop the dispersing tumor cells. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily and their cognate receptors regulate various cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. The TROY gene (TNFRSF19) encodes an orphan member of the TNFR superfamily: a type I cell-surface receptor that lacks a cytoplasmic death domain but contains a single TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-binding site. We demonstrate that TROY expression correlates inversely with patient survival and drives GB cell migration and invasion. Our results showed that TROY overexpression in glioma cells activated Rac1 signaling in a Pyk2-dependent manner to drive invasion and migration. Knockdown of TROY in a primary GB xenograft significantly prolonged survival in vivo. In addition, when we activated expression of TROY in mouse astrocytes in vivo using an RCAS vector system for glial-specific gene transfer in G-tva transgenic mice, astrocyte migration was induced within the brain, corroborating the in vitro importance of the TROY signaling cascade in GB invasion. TROY expression significantly increased resistance of GB cells to both IRand TMZ-induced apoptosis in vitro via the Akt and NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of either Akt or NF-kappaB activity suppressed the survival benefits of TROY signaling in response to TMZ treatment. These findings suggest that the aberrant expression and/or signaling by TROY contributes to, and possibly drives, the malignant dispersion of glioma cells.",Excluded

Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months.RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479).CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute. Cobalt 60 source decay did not affect outcomes of GKS for TN pain management, even for dose rates approximating a 2-half-life decay of the isotope.",Excluded
3567,"Microwaves and Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's diseases (AD) is the most common type of dementia and a neurodegenerative disease that occurs when the nerve cells in the brain die. The cause and treatment of AD remain unknown. However, AD is a disease that affects the brain, an organ that controls behavior. Accordingly, anything that can interact with the brain may affect this organ positively or negatively, thereby protecting or encouraging AD. In this regard, modern life encompasses microwaves for all issues including industrial, communications, medical and domestic tenders, and among all applications, the cell phone wave, which directly exposes the brain, continues to be the most used. Evidence suggests that microwaves may produce various biological effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and many arguments relay the possibility that microwaves may be involved in the pathophysiology of CNS disease, including AD. By contrast, previous studies have reported some beneficial cognitive effects and that microwaves may protect against cognitive impairment in AD. However, although many of the beneficial effects of microwaves are derived from animal models, but can easily be extrapolated to humans, whether microwaves cause AD is an important issue that is to be addressed in the current review.

2469,"Seizure suppression by EEG-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the rat OBJECTIVE: To test the anticonvulsive potential of a range of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequencies by novel methods for simultaneous EEG and rTMS in a rat seizure model.METHODS: Seizures were triggered by intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA; 10mg/kg). Rats (n=21) were divided into three groups in which individual seizures were treated with rTMS trains at one of three frequencies: 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 Hz. EEG was continuously viewed by an operator who identified each seizure onset. Consecutive seizures in each animal were (1) treated with active rTMS, (2) treated with sham rTMS, or (3) were untreated. EEG was re-analyzed post hoc by visual inspection, and seizure durations were compared within and between treatment groups.RESULTS: KA-induced seizures were abbreviated by 0.75 Hz (P=0.019) and 0.5 Hz (P=0.033) active EEG-guided rTMS. In contrast, neither active 0.25 Hz rTMS nor the control conditions affected seizure duration (P>0.2).CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that EEG-guided rTMS can suppress seizures in the rat KA epilepsy model, and that the effect is frequency dependent, with 0.75 and 0.5 Hz rTMS being superior to 0.25 Hz rTMS.SIGNIFICANCE: These data support the use of rat seizure models in translational research aimed at evaluation and development of effective rTMS anticonvulsive protocols. We also offer a proof of principle that real-time analysis of EEG can be used to guide rTMS to suppress individual seizures.",Excluded
2613,"Dose-responses from multi-model inference for the non-cancer disease mortality of atomic bomb survivors The non-cancer mortality data for cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular diseases from Report 13 on the atomic bomb survivors published by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation were analysed to investigate the dose-response for the influence of radiation on these detrimental health effects. Various parametric and categorical models (such as linear-no-threshold (LNT) and a number of threshold and step models) were analysed with a statistical selection protocol that rated the model description of the data. Instead of applying the usual approach of identifying one preferred model for each data set, a set of plausible models was applied, and a sub-set of non-nested models was identified that all fitted the data about equally well. Subsequently, this sub-set of non-nested models was used to perform multi-model inference (MMI), an innovative method of mathematically combining different models to allow risk estimates to be based on several plausible dose-response models rather than just relying on a single model of choice. This procedure thereby produces more reliable risk estimates based on a more comprehensive appraisal of model uncertainties. For CVD, MMI yielded a weak dose-response (with a risk estimate of about one-third of the LNT model) below a step at 0.6 Gy and a stronger dose-response at higher doses. The calculated risk estimates are consistent with zero risk below this threshold-dose. For mortalities related to cardiovascular diseases, an LNT-type dose-response was found with risk estimates consistent with zero risk below 2.2 Gy based on 90% confidence intervals. The MMI approach described here resolves a dilemma in practical radiation protection when one is forced to select between models with profoundly different dose-responses for risk estimates.",Included

3540,"A rodent in situ glioma allograft model to study bone marrow-derived cell migration Radiotherapy (RT) induced hypoxia recruits bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) to tumors through the upregulation of Stromal Derived Factor-1, a chemokine that binds to receptor CXCR4 present on BMDCs. The infiltration of BMDCs, which includes endothelial progenitors, pericyte progenitors, tumor-associated macrophages, immature monocytes, VEGFR<sup>+</sup> hemangiocytes, and CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells has been implicated in supporting tumor establishment by contributing to tumor growth, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, inflammation, and immune suppression. In this work, we have used a rodent glioma in situ allograft model to study the recruitment/migration of BMDCs post RT. Female albino C57 (8-10 weeks old, Jackson Laboratories) animals underwent +DsRed bone marrow transplant (B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-DsRed*MST)1Nagy/J donor mouse). Following engraftment, glioma cells were cranially implanted with 1x10 glioma cells (GL261-Luc, Perkin Elmer), at an average size of 26.4mm indicated by a bioluminescence signal of 5.28x10 photons/sec/cm/sr, animals underwent 6Gy (RadSource 2000, 250kVp, 25mA) of irradiation limited to a 1cm wide slit centered on the tumor. Bioluminescence (tumor size) and fluorescence imaging (+DsRed BMDCs) was performed prior to and at 1-and 2-weeks post-RT to assess tumor growth and measure the influx of +DsRed BMDCs. In addition, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the tumor and brain. To study the effect of BMDCs in tumor regression, tumors were irradiated at a smaller size (9.3mm) with 10Gy irradiation. At 1-week post-RT, flow cytometry was used to measure the number of BMDCs (CD45+) in the tumor. In our model 6Gy radiation was able to stall the growth of the tumor. Irradiated tumors did not significantly change in tumor size at either 1-or 2-weeks post irradiation compared to pre-RT size. In addition, irradiated tumors were significantly smaller than untreated tumors (p=0.0008) 1-week post-RT. Using flow cytometry 1-week post irradiation, we observed a significant increase in the number of +DsRed BMDCs in the irradiated tumor (23.5% of cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the irradiated brain (6.17% cells +DsRed BMDCs, p=0.03) as well as a significant increase in the tumors (16.6% cells +DsRed BMDCs) compared to the brain (11.1% cells +DsRed BMDCs p=0.02). There was no difference in the number of +DsRed BMDCS in tumors +/- irradiation or brains +/- irradiation. We found similar results in our tumor regression model using flow cytometry 1-week post-RT; we observed an increase in the number of BMDCs CD45+ in the tumor (~20% of cells CD45+) compared to control tumors (~6% of cells CD45+). Indicating that tumor size at the onset of RT did not effect the migration of BMDCs. Fluorescence imaging did not measure any significant change in the DsRed signal at 1-or 2-weeks post-irradiation. We have successfully shown that post-RT there is an increase in BMDCs migration at 1-week post RT regardless of tumor size at RT. Further experimentation is needed to better elucidate the role of BMDCs in tumor inflammation and immune suppression as well as angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Our next step is to perform immunohistochemistry on our collected tumor tissue to map out the spatial location of migrated BMDCs within the tumor.",Excluded
1302,"Radiation-induced trismus in the ARTSCAN head and neck trial UNLABELLED: Trismus, a well-known sequelae after treatment of head and neck cancer, decreases a patient's oral function and quality of life. The main objectives of this study were to: 1) investigate the long-term prevalence of radiation-induced trismus in patients treated for head and neck cancer according to two different fractionation schedules; and 2) model a dose-response relationship for trismus.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Swedish ARTSCAN trial, a prospective randomised multicentre study comparing conventional and accelerated fractionation. A total of 124 patients agreed to a clinical ENT examination 21-127 months (median 66 months) after beginning radiation therapy. Trismus-related scores were assessed using the EORTC H&N35 Quality of Life questionnaire. The TheraBite( R) range of motion scale was used to measure maximal interincisal distance. The dose-response relationship for structures important for mastication and the temporomandibular joints was investigated by normal tissue complication probability modelling.RESULTS: No significant differences in patient-reported trismus or maximal interincisal distance were found between the two trial arms. Patient-reported moderate to high scores regarding trismus increased from 3% at the start of radiation therapy to 25% at the long-term follow-up. Maximal interincisal distance correlated significantly with patient-reported scores of trismus. The best dose-response fit to the endpoint data was found for the dose to the ipsilateral masseter.CONCLUSIONS: Trismus is a persistent complication after radiotherapy with 3D-conformal radiation therapy. We found no difference between the severity and prevalence of trismus between conventional and accelerated fractionation, but a significant correlation between the absorbed dose to the mastication structures and opening of the mouth. Further prospective studies may determine whether a reduced dose to structures important for mastication using intensity-modulated radiation therapy will reduce problems with trismus.",Excluded
1422,"Stimulation through electrodes implanted near the subthalamic nucleus activates projections to motor areas of cerebral cortex in patients with Parkinson's disease High-frequency electrical stimulation through electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to reduce significantly the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the success of this treatment, the mechanisms of action of stimulation are poorly understood. To elucidate further the mechanisms of action of deep brain stimulation and its effects on cortical activity, we recorded electroencephalographic potentials from 61 scalp-surface electrodes during low-frequency (5-10 Hz) bipolar stimulation in 11 patients with advanced PD (14 implanted electrodes were tested). In all electrodes tested, stimulation through at least one of the four contacts produced a medium-latency waveform with an average onset of 14 +/- 3 ms and peak at 23 +/- 4 ms. This potential typically increased in magnitude across contacts from ventral to dorsal. Within-subject comparisons of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials demonstrated that the generator of the medium-latency potential was within the primary sensorimotor cortex or lateral premotor cortex ipsilateral to stimulation. The timing and topography of this potential were consistent with indirect activation of the cortex by excitation of pallido-thalamic axons that traverse the dorsal aspect of the STN. The potential evoked by stimulation through the contact used for optimal clinical effect was highly variable across electrodes and frequently different from the medium-latency potential described above, suggesting that the neuronal elements mediating the medium-latency potential were different from those that mediate the clinical effects.",Excluded
1086,"Fabrication and validation of reference structures for the localization of subdural standard- and micro-electrodes in MRI OBJECTIVE: Report simple reference structure fabrication and validate the precise localization of subdural micro- and standard electrodes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in phantom experiments.APPROACH: Electrode contacts with diameters of 0.3 mm and 4 mm are localized in 1.5 T MRI using reference structures made of silicone and iron oxide nanoparticle doping. The precision of the localization procedure was assessed for several standard MRI sequences and implant orientations in phantom experiments and compared to common clinical localization procedures.MAIN RESULTS: A localization precision of 0.41 +/- 0.20 mm could be achieved for both electrode diameters compared to 1.46 +/- 0.69 mm that was achieved for 4 mm standard electrode contacts localized using a common clinical standard method. The new reference structures are intrinsically bio-compatible, and they can be detected with currently available feature detection software so that a clinical implementation of this technology should be feasible.SIGNIFICANCE: Neuropathologies are increasingly diagnosed and treated with subdural electrodes, where the exact localization of the electrode contacts with respect to the patient's cortical anatomy is a prerequisite for the procedure. Post-implantation electrode localization using MRI may be advantageous compared to the common alternative of CT-MRI image co-registration, as it avoids systematic localization errors associated with the co-registration itself, as well as brain shift and implant movement. Additionally, MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast for the identification of brain lesions without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. Recent studies show that smaller electrodes and high-density electrode grids are ideal for clinical and research purposes, but the localization of these devices in MRI has not been demonstrated.",Excluded
3480,"Impact of Bounded Noise and Rewiring on the Formation and Instability of Spiral Waves in a Small-World Network of Hodgkin-Huxley Neurons Spiral waves are observed in the chemical, physical and biological systems, and the emergence of spiral waves in cardiac tissue is linked to some diseases such as heart ventricular fibrillation and epilepsy; thus it has importance in theoretical studies and potential medical applications. Noise is inevitable in neuronal systems and can change the electrical activities of neuron in different ways. Many previous theoretical studies about the impacts of noise on spiral waves focus an unbounded Gaussian noise and even colored noise. In this paper, the impacts of bounded noise and rewiring of network on the formation and instability of spiral waves are discussed in small-world (SW) network of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons through numerical simulations, and possible statistical analysis will be carried out. Firstly, we present SW network of HH neurons subjected to bounded noise. Then, it is numerically demonstrated that bounded noise with proper intensity sigma, amplitude A, or frequency f can facilitate the formation of spiral waves when rewiring probability p is below certain thresholds. In other words, bounded noise-induced resonant behavior can occur in the SW network of neurons. In addition, rewiring probability p always impairs spiral waves, while spiral waves are confirmed to be robust for small p, thus shortcut-induced phase transition of spiral wave with the increase of p is induced. Furthermore, statistical factors of synchronization are calculated to discern the phase transition of spatial pattern, and it is confirmed that larger factor of synchronization is approached with increasing of rewiring probability p, and the stability of spiral wave is destroyed.",Excluded

1608,"Sex-dependent differences in the activity and modulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors in rat dorsal root ganglia neurons Women have greater temporal summation of experimental pain stimuli and also have a higher propensity for developing chronic visceral pain conditions. Sex hormone-mediated regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) in nociceptive pathways is a plausible mechanism that may underlie these phenomena. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) in modulation of NMDAR activity in adult male and female rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons were collected from adult male or female rats and grown in short-term culture in steroid-free media. NMDAR currents were recorded on small to medium size neurons by whole cell patch clamp using rapid perfusion with saturating concentrations of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid and glycine in the absence of extracellular Mg(2+). We found that the average density of NMDAR currents was 2.8-fold larger in DRG neurons from female rats compared with male rats (P<0.0001). Addition of 100 nM E2 increased NMDAR currents 55+/-15% in female neurons, but only 19+/-7% in male neurons. Potentiation was maximal after 20-40 min and dose dependent with an apparent 50% excitatory concentration of 17-23 nM. This effect was mimicked by E2 conjugated to BSA and attenuated by pretreatment with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A (1 microM) or the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI 182,780 (1 microM), strongly suggesting activation of a cell surface ER acting through a non-genomic mechanism involving protein tyrosine kinases to increase NMDAR currents. These results identify sex-based differences in both the basal expression and the regulation of the NMDARs in DRG neurons.",Excluded

1110,"Charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular malformations Heavy charged-particle radiation has unique physical characteristics that offer several advantages over photons and protons for stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial AVMs. These include improved dose distributions with depth in tissue, small angle of lateral scattering, and sharp distal fall-off of dose in the Bragg ionization peak. Under multi-institutionally approved clinical trials, we have used stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery to treat approximately 400 patients with symptomatic, surgically inaccessible vascular malformations at the UCB-LBL 184-in synchrocyclotron and bevatron. Treatment planning for stereotactic heavy charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular disorders integrates anatomic and physical information from the stereotactic cerebral angiogram and stereotactic CT and MR imaging scans for each patient, using computerized treatment-planning calculations for optimal isodose contour distribution. The shape of an intracranial AVM is associated strongly with its treatability and potential clinical outcome. In this respect, heavy charged-particle radiosurgery has distinct advantages over other radiosurgical methods; the unique physical properties allow the shaping of individual beams to encompass the contours of large and complexly shaped AVMs, while sparing important adjacent neural structures. We have had a long-term dose-searching clinical protocol in collaboration with SUMC and UCSF and have followed up over 300 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, treatment doses ranged from 45 GyE to 35 GyE. Currently, total doses up to 25 GyE are delivered to treatment volumes ranging from 0.1 cm3 to 70 cm3. This represents a relatively homogeneous dose distribution, with the 90% isodose surface contoured to the periphery of the lesion; there is considerable protection of normal adjacent brain tissues, and most of the brain receives no radiation exposure. Dose selection depends on the volume, shape, and location of the AVM and several other factors, including the volume of normal brain that must be traversed by the plateau portion of the charged-particle beam. The first 230 patients have been evaluated clinically to the end of 1989. Using the clinical grading of Drake, about 90% of the patients had an excellent or good neurologic grade, about 5% had a poor grade, and about 5% had progression of disease and died, or died as a result of unrelated intercurrent illness. Neuroradiologic follow-up to the end of 1989 indicated the following rates of complete angiographic obliteration 3 years after treatment: 90% to 95% for AVM treatment volumes less than 4 cm3, 90% to 95% for volumes 4 to 14 cm3, and 60% to 70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Excluded
1667,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma OBJECT Systemic control of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has substantially improved with the development of VEGF, mTOR, and checkpoint inhibitors. The current first-line standard of care is a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate the response to radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong the time to salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy or second-line systemic therapy. As the prevalence of mRCC has increased, the utilization of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment with SRS and TKIs remain largely undefined. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the safety and efficacy of TKIs when delivered concurrently with SRS. The authors hypothesized that first-line TKIs delivered concurrently with SRS significantly increase local control compared with SRS alone or TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing spine SRS for mRCC was conducted. Patients undergoing SRS were divided into 4 cohorts: those receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), and patients who were undergoing SRS with (C) or without (D) concurrent TKI treatment after failure of first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) was also included, consisting of patients with spinal metastases managed with TKIs alone. The primary outcome was 12-month local failure, defined as any in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to determine the independent effect of concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure. RESULTS One hundred patients who underwent 151 spine SRS treatments (232 vertebral levels) were included. At the time of SRS, 46% were receiving concurrent TKI therapy. In each SRS cohort, the median prescription dose was 16 Gy in 1 fraction. Patients in Cohort A had the highest burden of epidural disease (96%, p < 0.01). At 12 months, the cumulative incidence of local failure was 4% in Cohort A, compared with 19%-27% in Cohorts B-D and 57% in Cohort E (p < 0.01). Multivariate competing risks regression demonstrated that concurrent first-line TKI treatment (Cohort A) was independently associated with a local control benefit (HR 0.21, p = 0.04). In contrast, patients treated with TKIs alone (Cohort E) experienced an increased rate of local failure (HR 2.43, p = 0.03). No toxicities of Grade 3 or greater occurred following SRS with concurrent TKI treatment, and the incidence of post-SRS vertebral fracture (overall 21%) and pain flare (overall 17%) were similar across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis for patients with mRCC has significantly improved with TKIs. The present investigation suggests a local control benefit with the addition of concurrent first-line TKI therapy to spine SRS. These results have implications in the oligometastatic setting and support a body of preclinical radiobiological research.",Included
1596,"Expression of markers for pericytes and myofibroblasts in bleomycin (BLEO)-induced dermal fibrosis: Potential role of neuropeptide receptors in a mouse model for scleroderma (SSC) Background: SSc is a chronic collagen-vascular disease that manifests initially with dermal fibrosis, then later progresses to multiple organ fibrosis. There is no treatment to arrest SSc. Recently, a mouse model of SSc was reported, in which Bleo is injected intradermally (ID) for 21-28 days. Two labs showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause this dermal fibrosis. We previously observed that ROS trigger GRP-mediated pulmonary fibrosis to hyperoxia or radiation. We first verified that ROS trigger this dermal fibrosis, and now test the hypothesis that gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) from cutaneous nerves has a role in this process by acting on myofibroblasts [alpha-smooth muscle actin, SMA+] and pericytes [SMA+ and neural/glial antigen 2, NG2+]. We tested expression of both GRP receptors, GRPR and neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) by immunohistochemistry. Design(s): Flanks of 10-wk old C3H/HeJ females were injected ID with Bleo (100-mug) 5d/wk for 3-wks. Some mice also received antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) IP, and other Bleo mice received GRP blocking mAb-2A11. After 21d, lesions paraffin sections were immunostained for SMA, NG2, GRPR, or NMBR. Relative extent of immunostaining in dermis and epidermis was scored by 2 observers (EK & MES) on a scale from 0-3, comparing prevalence of (+) cells (0, 1=detected in few cells, 2=many cells (+), & 3=most cells positive. Result(s): Bleo induced >10-fold increased pericytes & myofibroblasts, in dermis (P<0.001), and NG2 and SMA staining scores were linearly correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = .87, P<0.05). SMA & NG2 were reduced by NAC (~80% decrease, P<0.001) or mAb2A11 (~50% decrease, P<0.01), similar to our prior studies of dermal thickness. Epidermal scores for GRPR were significantly decreased in Bleo+2A11 mice compared to Bleo alone (0.5 +/- 0.3, 1.9 +/- 0.3, P < 0.005), like prior studies of GRPR up-regulation by GRP. However, there were no other differences in GRPR between study groups. NMBR scores were unchanged amongst the groups. Conclusion(s): In the mouse model of scleroderma, increased pericytes and myofibroblasts occur in regions of dermal fibrosis. Although GRPR &/or NMBR could contribute to Bleo-induced dermal fibrosis their expression is unchanged between groups. We previously determined that GRP induces GRPR gene expression. Regardless, sustained epidermal expression of both receptors would be consistent with potential GRP signaling in epidermis as a mechanism for epidermal hyperplasia and dermal fibrosis, such as through epithelial-mesenchymal transformation.",Excluded

Mean age was 63 years (standard deviation 12.1) and 56% were women. The radiotherapy fields were breast (35%), abdomen/pelvis (15%), prostate/bladder (21%), head/neck (10%) and other (8%).KEY RESULTS: The patients experiencing nausea within the observed week (n=31) had, compared to the patients not experiencing nausea (n=100), lower ability in daily activities in general (p=0.001), in shopping (p=0.014), walking (p=0.007) and social interaction (p=0.007). Of the patients with nausea 48% had seldom woken up rested and 34% were not able to eat as much as they used to. Corresponding figures for nausea free patients were 27% (not significant; ns) and 16% (ns). Six (5%) experienced vomiting, 15 (12%) diarrhoea, 23 (18%) constipation and 52 (40%) any gastrointestinal symptoms. Forty seven (90%) were negatively bothered by the experienced gastrointestinal symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: The fourth of patients experiencing nausea during radiotherapy had lower ability to perform daily activities than the three quarters of patients who were free from nausea. Few patients vomited while 40% experienced gastrointestinal symptoms during the observed week of radiotherapy. This implies that health care professionals could consider identifying nauseous patients that possibly need support in nausea-reduction and in daily activities during radiotherapy.",Excluded
3168,"Magnetic resonance based small animal radiotherapy in neuro-oncology Compared to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides vastly superior soft-tissue contrast. This makes it much easier to visualize lesion boundaries that will result in a much better delineation of the target volume, helping to better irradiate the lesion and avoid surrounding tissue.Therefore, combining MRI with CT data is increasingly used for radiotherapy planning in the clinic. This combined CT/MRI dataset contains both the information required for targeting and for dose calculations. During this presentation, three studies will be presented where MRI and small animal radiotherapy were combined in the field of neuro-oncology. In a first study, we used a combined CT/MRI dataset to guide the irradiation of brain tumours in a F98 glioblastoma rat model using a micro-irradiator. Contrast-enhanced MRI images were acquired to follow up tumour growth after orthotopic inoculation, to monitor treatment response, and to delineate the target volume during radiotherapy planning. Using multiple non-coplanar arcs the prescribed dose could be delivered to 90% of the target volume, while minimizing the dose to normal brain tissue. A challenging aspects of small animal CT imaging relates to the radiation dose received by the animals. This might become a very important issue when the therapeutic dose has to be delivered in multiple fractions spaced over time, where each individual irradiation requires a CT for accurate animal positioning. Therefore, in a second study we investigated the feasibility of a MRI-only based workflow for radiotherapy planning of the rat brain, that enables both accurate target delineation and accurate dose calculations using only MRI-based volumes. Multiple MRI sequences were used to generate synthetic CT images that could be used for dose calculations, because only one MRI volume was not sufficient to separate all major tissue types (air, soft tissue, bone) in the rat head. The synthetic CT images were sufficiently similar to the segmented CT images that are routinely used for radiotherapy planning on preclinical radiation research platforms. No significant differences were observed between CT and MRI based dose calculations when more complex beam configurations (multiple beams) were used in the dose plan. However, further research is required in the thoracic or abdominal region of small animals, where more tissue classes will be required to allow for accurate dose calculations compared to the rat head. Finally, discrimination between brain tumor recurrence (glioblastoma) and radiation necrosis (RN) remains a diagnostic challenge because both entities have similar imaging characteristics on conventional MRI. Functional imaging techniques, such as dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI or positron emission tomography (PET), could overcome this diagnostic dilemma. A third study will be presented to investigate the potential of DCE-MRI and PET in discriminating high-grade glioma from RN in rats.

2586,"Rotating night shifts and risk of breast cancer in women participating in the nurses' health study BACKGROUND: Melatonin shows potential oncostatic action, and light exposure during night suppresses melatonin production. There is little information, however, about the direct effect of night work on the risk of cancer. We investigated the effect of night work in breast cancer.METHODS: We examined the relationship between breast cancer and working on rotating night shifts during 10 years of follow-up in 78 562 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Information was ascertained in 1988 about the total number of years during which the nurses had worked rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month. From June 1988 through May 1998, we documented 2441 incident breast cancer cases. Logistic regression models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for confounding variables and breast cancer risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: We observed a moderate increase in breast cancer risk among the women who worked 1-14 years or 15-29 years on rotating night shifts (multivariate adjusted RR = 1.08 [95% CI = 0.99 to 1.18] and RR = 1.08 [95% CI = 0.90 to 1.30], respectively). The risk was further increased among women who worked 30 or more years on the night shift (RR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.78). The test for trend was statistically significant (P =.02).CONCLUSIONS: Women who work on rotating night shifts with at least three nights per month, in addition to days and evenings in that month, appear to have a moderately increased risk of breast cancer after extended periods of working rotating night shifts.",Excluded
3192,"Feasibility of intracoronary beta-irradiation to reduce restenosis after balloon angioplasty. A clinical pilot study BACKGROUND: With the aim of decreasing the incidence of restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty, we developed a technique of intracoronary beta-irradiation using an endoluminally centered pure metallic 90Y source. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility and safety profile of this approach with a dose of 18 Gy delivered to the inner arterial surface.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between June 21 and November 15, 1995, fifteen patients (6 women and 9 men; mean age, 71 +/- 5 years) underwent intracoronary beta-irradiation immediately after a conventional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedure. The PTCA/irradiation procedure was technically feasible in all attempted cases, and the delivery of the 18 Gy dose was accomplished without complications. In 4 patients, the intervention was completed through intra-arterial stent implantation because of dissection induced by the initial PTCA. During the follow-up period of 178 +/- 17 days (range, 150 to 225 days), no complication occurred that could be attributed to radiation therapy. No aneurysm or angiographically detectable thrombus was observed in any of the irradiated arterial segments. The clinical event rate (4 of 15 patients underwent further target lesion revascularization) and the angiographic follow-up (6 of 15 patients had a > 50%-diameter stenosis at the previously treated site) did not suggest a marked impact on the expected restenosis rate.CONCLUSIONS: This early experience demonstrates that our approach is feasible, and no side effects attributable to radiation were noted during a 6-month period of follow-up. Whether higher doses of beta-irradiation will favorably affect post-PTCA restenosis in patients must await further evaluation.",Excluded
2997,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma.METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded
0,"ASCO 2014: High prevalence of FLT-3 ITD mutations in patients (pts) with AML who present with CNS relapse Background: Despite CR rates of 70% with modern chemotherapeutic regimens, most pts with AML relapse. CNS relapses have become uncommon with the use of high-dose cytarabine based regimens. The features associated with a higher risk of CNS relapse are not defined. Method(s): We analyzed adults who presented with AML and CNS relapses from 2000 until 2014. CNS leukemia was diagnosed by the presence of blasts in a cytocentrifuge preparation of CSF. Pts with blasts in the CSF together with high numbers of red blood cells (> 5) were not considered to have CNS disease if the blasts were high in the PB. Result(s): Of the 1312 pts with AML treated at our institution, 71 (5%) had CNS disease. Median age was 57 years. CNS involvement was detected after a median of 8 months from the initial diagnosis. 4 pts (6%) had isolated CNS relapse that was followed by systemic relapse after a median of 2 weeks. CNS involvement was detected in the setting of refractory AML in 31 pts (44%). 64 pts (90%) received previous high-dose cytarabine. 54 pts (76%) had neurologic symptoms at time of CNS relapse. CNS imaging was performed in 67 pts (94%): 41 (61%) had abnormal findings by MRI suggestive of CNS disease. 4 pts had zero cells with blasts detected on cytocentrifuge preparation only. None of the 4 pts had circulating blasts and all had abnormal findings on brain MRI suggestive of CNS relapse. 18 pts (25%) were FLT3-ITD mutated. CNS involvement was more commonly observed in young pts with increased WBC, BM blasts, and LDH, with M4/M5 phenotype, and FLT3/ITD mutated (12% versus 5%, p=0.003). Treatment for CNS disease consisted of IT chemotherapy in all pts, whole brain radiation therapy in 14, and spinal radiation in 8. Therapy was successful in clearing all signs of CNS disease in 29 (41%). 19 of the 29 pts (65%) subsequently had additional CNS relapses after a median of 3 months. The 2-year survival rate after CNS relapse was 13%. There was no difference in overall survival among patients with or without CNS disease. Conclusion(s): CNS relapse is a rare occurrence in AML (5%) and is associated with a poor prognosis. A high prevalence of FLT3-ITD mutations was observed in these pts. FLT3 mutational status and LDH level may identify patients with AML who may benefit from CNS prophylaxis.",Excluded

Rats were exposed to ionizing radiation, super-high frequency, hypoxia, hyperoxia, vibration and acceleration (applied separately or in combination) which have been traditionally in the focus of space and aviation medicine. Brain interneuronal junctions were found to be very sensitive to the above effects, particularly ionizing radiation and hypoxia. Conversely, synapses were shown to be highly resistant to short-term hyperoxia and electromagnetic radiation. When combined effects were used, responses of interneuronal junctions depended on the irradiation dose and order of application of radiation and other flight factors.",Included

Paintreatment is mainly supportive. Recovery with LSP is less satisfactory and occurs over months to years, but may be incomplete. A 59-year old man was referred for intermittent, neuralgic pain localized to the right gluteal region and leg. He also developed slight neurologic symptoms such as numbness, paraesthesias and a slight weakness of the right leg. The symptoms had begun 6 months after radiation therapy after prostatectomy for prostate carcinoma. There were no antecendent back or hip injuries. There was a right Lasegue sign. On the visual analog scale pain ranks between 0 (rest) and 8-10 (attack) were recorded. Needle electromyography showed denervation in gluteus medius and maximus, biceps femoris, quadriceps femoris, tibialis ant and peroneus longus. Normal laboratory studies included urin analysis, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimention rate, serumglucose, electrolytes, rheumatoid factor, and protein electrophoresis. Pelvic computed tomography (CT) was normal. Lumbosacral MRI was not performed. Liver- and renal enzymes were elevated. On admission the patient was treated with diclofenac (2 x 50 mg/d) and carbarnazepine (3 x 200 mg). Gabapentin was chosen because it is well tolerated and it appears to have a favorable efficacy-to-toxicity ratio. He was then started on gabapentin, 100 mg given orally three times daily. 60 minutes after the first dose of gabapentin, the patient had a significant pain relief that lasted 6 h. The gabapentin dose was increased to 300 mg three times daily. After 6 months he continued to report good pain relief with minimal sedating side effects on a regimen of 3 x 300 mg/d gabapentin. To our knowledge this is the first case report of LSP which was successfully treated with the novel anti-epileptic drug gabapentin.",Excluded
3402,"Acoustic neuromas: Evaluation of outcomes and toxicity with the use of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy Purpose/Objective: A number of different therapeutic strategies are commonly used to treat acoustic neuromas including gamma knife radiosurgery, linear accelerator based radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Our centre treats patients with a fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy regime of 52.5 Gray in 25 fractions. Outcomes and toxicities of patients treated with this regime from 1995 to 2010 are presented here. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review of all the available electronic case notes, as well as imaging reports for patients treated for acoustic neuroma, were conducted. RECIST criteria were used to assess response on imaging and treatment outcomes, and were analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Toxicity assessments were also conducted. Radiotherapy methods include immobilisation in a non-invasive relocatable Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame with stereotactic head ring. A depth helmet was also used to ensure and verify reproducibility and a maximum tolerance of 2 mm was permitted. For tumour localisation and organs at risk (OAR) delineation a planning CT scan of the head was performed with the stereotactic head ring in place using 2 mm slices. CT images were transferred to the X knife radiotherapy planning computer system via the DICOM network for automatic external contouring, clinician contouring of target volume and OAR, followed by dose planning. After 2001 diagnostic 2mm stealth MRI scans were co-registered with the planning CT scan to allow more accurate delineation of target volume and OAR. Most patients were treated with an average of 3 non-coplanar arcs, with each arc having an equal collimator size which tended to be about 3 cm. This therefore produced a spherical shaped dose distribution. The choice of collimator size and arrangement of arcs depended on the size of tumour and location in relationship to the OAR, in particular the brainstem. A single iso-centre was chosen and the radiation dose was usually prescribed to 100% at the iso-centre using 6 MV photons. Result(s): 93 patients were identified of which 83 patients were available for follow-up with a median period of 5.7 years. Overall control rate using RECIST criteria was 92% (Fig 1). Toxicity data were available for 90 patients with 6 (7%) experiencing a reduction in hearing, 1 (1%) had a deterioration in their trigeminal nerve function and 1 (1%) had a deterioration in facial nerve function (Table 1). 4 (4%) patients developed hydrocephalus, requiring the placement of a shunt and 1 (1%) patient developed radiation brainstem necrosis. After further evaluation this patient was deemed to have been treated within acceptable dose constraints. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): This data suggests that a good control rate of acoustic neuromas is achievable using fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to a dose of 52.5 Gray in 25 fractions. Toxicity is on the whole acceptable but the episode of radiation brainstem necrosis remains of concern.",Excluded

2291,"Standard radiotherapy for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma results in progressive tract-specific brain white matter alterations: A one-year follow-up via diffusion tensor imaging BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation therapy (RT)-induced neurocognitive disability may be mediated by brain tissue damage. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of standard RT on normal brain tissue via in vivo neuroimaging in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 146 newly diagnosed NPC patients who were treated with standard RT were longitudinally followed up at multiple time points during the first year post-RT, with 19 comparable healthy controls followed up in parallel serving as normal age-related benchmarks. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used to evaluate longitudinal brain white matter tract changes in NPC patients. The relationships between RT-related white matter changes, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive impairment were also assessed.RESULTS: Bilateral cingulate angular bundle (CAB) fibers had progressive diffusion reduction [radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity] over time (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) in NPC patients during the first year after RT. RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with longitudinal atrophy of the ipsilateral hippocampus (P = 0.033). Additionally, RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with progressive cognitive impairment in NPC patients post-RT (P = 0.048).CONCLUSION: We present evidence of progressive RT-associated changes in the bilateral CAB in NPC patients, which may underlie RT-related cognitive impairment. These findings illustrate that the use of white matter tract alterations as potential biomarkers to detect RT-related brain injury in NPC patients may be useful for better understanding the pathogenesis of RT-induced cognitive decline.",Included

Severe toxicities may influence body composition, including skeletal muscle mass, and increase postoperative complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of sarcopenia, changes in body composition, and adverse events during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) on postoperative complications in esophageal cancer patients.METHODS: A total of 83 patients with esophageal cancer undergoing NACT followed by esophagectomy were included. Body composition was assessed before chemotherapy and before esophagectomy. The relationships between postoperative infectious complications and sarcopenia, changes in body composition, and adverse events during NACT were investigated.RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that skeletal muscle loss during NACT, but not preoperative sarcopenia, was significantly higher in the complication (+) group. Febrile neutropenia tended to occur frequently in the complication (+) group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that skeletal muscle loss was the only factor significantly associated with infectious complications (p = 0.029). Among adverse events, febrile neutropenia was significantly associated with a decrease in skeletal muscle mass.CONCLUSION: Loss of skeletal muscle mass during NACT was a significant risk factor for postoperative infectious complications in patients with esophageal cancer. Prevention of severe adverse events may reduce postoperative infectious complications.",Excluded

1191,"Randomized, prospective, and controlled clinical trial of pulsed electromagnetic field stimulation for cervical fusion Background context: Multilevel fusions, the use of allograft bone, and smoking have been associated with an increased risk of nonunion after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation has been shown to increase arthrodesis rates after lumbar spine fusion surgery, but there are minimal data concerning the effect of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. Purpose(s): To determine the efficacy and safety of PEMF stimulation as an adjunct to arthrodesis after ACDF in patients with potential risk factors for nonunion. Study design: A randomized, controlled, prospective multicenter clinical trial. Patient Sample: Three hundred and twenty-three patients with radiographic evidence (computed tomography-myelogram [CT-myelo] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of a compressed cervical nerve root and symptomatic radiculopathy appropriate to the compressed root that had failed to respond to nonoperative management were enrolled in the study. The patients were either smokers (more than one pack per day) and/or were undergoing multilevel fusions. All patients underwent ACDF using the Smith-Robinson technique. Allograft bone and an anterior cervical plate were used in all cases. Outcome measures: Measurements were obtained preoperatively and at each postoperative interval and included neurologic assessment, visual analog scale (VAS) scores for shoulder/arm pain at rest and with activity, SF-12 scores, the neck disability index (NDI), and radiographs (anteroposterior, lateral, and flexion-extension views). Two orthopedic surgeons not otherwise affiliated with the study and blinded to treatment group evaluated the radiographs, as did a blinded radiologist. Adverse events were reported by all patients throughout the study to determine device safety. Method(s): Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those receiving PEMF stimulation after surgery (PEMF group, 163 patients) and those not receiving PEMF stimulation (control group, 160 patients). Postoperative care was otherwise identical. Follow-up was carried out at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Result(s): The PEMF and control groups were comparable with regard to age, gender, race, past medical history, smoking status, and litigation status. Both groups were also comparable in terms of baseline diagnosis (herniated disc, spondylosis, or both) and number of levels operated (one, two, three, or four). At 6 months postoperatively, the PEMF group had a significantly higher fusion rate than the control group (83.6% vs. 68.6%, p=.0065). At 12 months after surgery, the stimulated group had a fusion rate of 92.8% compared with 86.7% for the control group (p=.1129). There were no significant differences between the PEMF and control groups with regard to VAS pain scores, NDI, or SF-12 scores at 6 or 12 months. No significant differences were found in the incidence of adverse events in the groups. Conclusion(s): This is the first randomized, controlled trial that analyzes the effects of PEMF stimulation on cervical spine fusion. PEMF stimulation significantly improved the fusion rate at 6 months postoperatively in patients undergoing ACDF with an allograft and an anterior cervical plate, the eligibility criteria being patients who were smokers or had undergone multilevel cervical fusion. At 12 months postoperatively, however, the fusion rate for PEMF patients was not significantly different from that of the control group. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events in the two groups, indicating that the use of PEMF stimulation is safe in this clinical setting. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

342,"Planning of radiotherapy with PET: Volumes only? Aim: We assess the percentage of cases in which findings of distant disease through 18F-FDG PET/CT for radiotherapy planning lead to changes in the modality and/or intent of the treatment, or change in stage IV. Material(s) and Method(s): All the studies derived from the Radiotherapy department were retrospectively analysed. Those performed for radiotherapy planning were selected. Cases with distant disease findings were assessed, investigating changes in the modality or intent of treatment and change in stage IV. One thousand four hundred seventy six studies were derived from the Radiotherapy department between April/09 and December/13. Three hundred and seventy three (25,3%) were performed for radiotherapy planning (267 males and 106 females, mean age 68.2 years). The intention of radiotherapy was for radical treatment planning. Result(s): In 45 of these studies (12%) there were previously not suspected findings that suggested an upstage of the patients to a clinical stage IV. The unexpected disease was located more frequently in bone (12 patients), followed by lung (9 patients), liver (10), distant adenopathy (6 patients), brain (4 patients), adrenal glands (4 patients), spleen (1 patient) and multiple progression (1 patient).In twenty-six (26/45, 7%) of these patients the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT were confirmed as true positive for distant metastasis with complementary examinations. In sixteen (16/26) of them the modality of treatment was changed. In ten of them (10/26) the intent of treatment was changed from curative to palliative. In three patients a second primary tumour was confirmed.In remaining sixteen (16/45) patients the results of 18F-FDG PET/CT could not be initially confirmed. The confirmation was made by monitoring progression in eleven patients, one patient remained with stable disease and four patients died without being able to confirm the findings. Conclusion(s): 18F-FDG PET/CT studies in radiotherapy planning improve the staging of patients, leading to an upstage in a significant number of patients. Based upon the findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT, the modality or the intent of treatment may radically change, (making unnecessary radiation) or changing the intent to palliative.",Excluded
1704,"A study on an evaluation of brain scanning in cerebrovascular diseases. [Japanese] One hundred twenty cases of cerebrovascular diseases mainly of ischemic nature were studied. Positive brain scans were found in ischemic cerebral infarction in 68% of the cases; with a relatively low rate in the early phase from the onset of the illness showing a peak of positive scans in 2 to 4 wk with a gradual decline. Even those with a positive scan turned negative after 8 wk. A definite correlation between the clinical severity and positive scan was found. In cases with cortical involvement positive brain scan was observed in high frequency. Single brain scan yielded only a value of screening procedure but follow-up examinations in the course of illness proved to be rather important for the differential diagnosis of underlying pathology and further for fortelling the prognosis. In view of the prognosis of motor functions those with an intense uptake of radioisotope, a relatively large sized and persistent abnormality were likely left with severe neurological deficit while in cases who showed a mild and transient positive scan the recovery of motor functions were favorable. When rate of positive scan for the respective territory of cerebral vessels were evaluated, positive scans were most frequently observed in the vicinity of middle cerebral artery. The frequency of positive scans in the territory of posterior cerebral artery and vertebro-basilar artery were found lowest. Brain scanning was found most suitable for the diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, subdural hematoma and SLE vasculitis but it exhibited merely low rate of posivity in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage and transient ischemic attack. This method compared to other auxillary diagnostic procedures presently available proved to be accurate with its technical simplicity.

However, information regarding the incidence of acute adverse reactions in patients after low-dose radioiodine therapy has not been reported. In this study, the acute radiation effects after low-dose radioiodine ablation therapy in postsurgical differentiated thyroid cancer patients was evaluated. Fifty-six patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were prospectively evaluated. None of these patients had evidence of a distant metastasis. All patients received 40 mCi (1480 MBq) I-131 MIBG orally and were evaluated for symptoms and signs by a physician on the second and seventh days after therapy. Xerostomia and nausea were the most common complaints with the same incidence rate of 5.35%. Gastralgia occurred at a frequency of 3.57%. Pain in the thyroid bed, tenderness over a parotid gland, submandibular glands, change in taste, and vomiting all were found at a frequency of 1.78%. Maximum reactions generally occurred 24-48 hours after therapy. All the symptoms except for xerostomia resolved completely in most patients within a week. In comparison with high-dose ablation therapy published in the literature, the incidence of radiation reactions in low-dose radioiodine therapy was much lower.

The tumor was entirely within the treatment region in all patients. The fraction of the predicted high-dose and low-dose regions corresponding with an absolute scotoma was fitted by a linear regression model (r2 = .721) with three independent variables: dose region, initial condition, and time since therapy. The defect in the maximum-dose region increased at an average rate of 0.270/year. This differed (P = .002) from the rate in the penumbra region: (0.104/year). The rate in the penumbra differed (P = .01) from that in the predicted low-dose region, where scotoma did not increase with time. The pattern and time course of visual field loss in the different radiation dose regions tended to support the conclusion that isodose calculations are accurate. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that visual loss secondary to irradiation results primarily from radiation vasculopathy and not from direct damage to photoreceptors or ganglion cells. Development of an absolute scotoma may require a dose in excess of 5,000 rads.",Excluded
1230,"Potential Improvements in Brain Dose Estimates For Internal Emitters BACKGROUND: Element-specific biokinetic models are used to reconstruct doses to systemic tissues from internal emitters. Typically, a systemic model for a radionuclide explicitly depicts only its dominant repositories. Remaining tissues and fluids are aggregated into a pool called Other tissue in which the radionuclide is assumed to be uniformly distributed. In the systemic biokinetic models used in radiation protection, the brain usually is addressed as an implicit mass fraction of Other tissue rather than an explicitly depicted repository. Due to increasing interest in radiation effects on the brain, efforts are underway to improve brain dosimetry for internal radiation sources.METHODS: We assessed potential improvements in brain dosimetry for internal emitters by explicitly modelling brain kinetics rather than treating the brain as a mass fraction of Other tissue. We selected ten elements for which brain kinetics can be modeled using published biokinetic data. Injection dose coefficients were calculated for a relatively long-lived radioisotope of each element using each of two versions of the ICRP's latest systemic biokinetic model for each element, the original version and a modified version differing only in the treatment of brain. If the ICRP model contained an explicit brain pool, the modified version depicted brain instead as a mass fraction of Other tissue. If the ICRP model included brain in Other tissue, the modified version included an explicit brain pool with kinetics based on best available brain-specific data.RESULTS: The result for a given radionuclide is expressed as a ratio A:B, where A and B are the dose coefficients based on the versions of the model with and without an explicit brain pool, respectively. The following ratios A:B were obtained for the 10 radionuclides addressed here: 241Am, 0.13; 207Bi, 0.57; 234U, 0.81; 239Pu, 0.96; 203Hg (vapor), 1.4; 134Cs, 1.5; 54Mn, 1.7; 210Po, 1.7; 226Ra, 1.9; 210Pb, 3.3. These ratios indicate that a dose estimate for brain based on a biokinetic model with brain implicitly contained in Other tissue may substantially underestimate or substantially overestimate a dose estimate that reflects best available brain-specific biokinetic data. Of course, the reliability of the latter estimate depends on the quality of the underlying biokinetic data.CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, the brain should be depicted explicitly in biokinetic models used in epidemiological studies addressing adverse effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded
1713,"Anatomically consistent CNN-based segmentation of organs-at-risk in cranial radiotherapy Planning of radiotherapy involves accurate segmentation of a large number of organs at risk (OAR), i.e., organs for which irradiation doses should be minimized to avoid important side effects of the therapy. We propose a deep learning method for segmentation of OAR inside the head, from magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Our system performs segmentation of eight structures: eye, lens, optic nerve, optic chiasm, pituitary gland, hippocampus, brainstem, and brain. We propose an efficient algorithm to train neural networks for an end-to-end segmentation of multiple and nonexclusive classes, addressing problems related to computational costs and missing ground truth segmentations for a subset of classes. We enforce anatomical consistency of the result in a postprocessing step. In particular, we introduce a graph-based algorithm for segmentation of the optic nerves, enforcing the connectivity between the eyes and the optic chiasm. We report cross-validated quantitative results on a database of 44 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRIs with provided segmentations of the considered OAR, which were originally used for radiotherapy planning. In addition, the segmentations produced by our model on an independent test set of 50 MRIs were evaluated by an experienced radiotherapist in order to qualitatively assess their accuracy. The mean distances between produced segmentations and the ground truth ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 mm across different organs.

243,"Transradial versus transfemoral approach for percutaneous intervention of coronary chronic total occlusions applying the hybrid algorithm: Insights from RECHARGE registry Background: The feasibility of transradial approach (TRA) for chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been completely assessed as the majority of operators prefer the femoral route for CTO intervention. Purpose(s): The aim of the current study is to assess technical success, complication rates and procedural efficiency in TRA and transfemoral approach (TFA) in a large prospective European registry adopting the hybrid algorithm for CTO PCI (RECHARGE). Method(s): We analyzed 1253 CTO PCI procedures performed according to the hybrid protocol in 17 European centers, comparing TRA (single or bi-radial access) and TFA (single or bi-femoral or combined radial and femoral access). Result(s): TRA was applied in 306 (24%, 159 unilateral radial, 147 bilateral radial) and TFA in 947 (76%, 126 unilateral femoral, 271 bilateral femoral, 550 combined radial and femoral access) cases. The average J-CTO score was 2.1+/-1.2 in TRA and 2.3+/-1.1 in TFA (p=0.06). Technical success was achieved in 85% in TRA and 86% in TFA (p=0.51). Technical success was similar for TRA and TFA in multivariable analysis. In-hospital major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE) occurred in 2.0% in TRA and 2.9% in TFA (p=0.40). Major access-site bleeding occurred in 0.3% in TRA and 0.5% in TFA (p=0.66). TRA compared with TFA had similar procedural duration (80 [54-120] vs 90 [60-121] min, p=0.07), similar radiation dose (DAP 89 [52-163] vs 101 [59-171] gray*cm<sup>2</sup>, p=0.06) and lower contrast agent use (200 [150-310] vs 250 [200-350] ml, p<0.01). Conclusion(s): In the largest TRA CTO series to date, TRA CTO PCI is associated with an equally high rate of success compared with TFA with low complication rates and no decrease in procedural efficiency.",Excluded
989,"Pions and pig skin: preclinical evaluation of RBE for early and late damage The skin of 50 pigs has been irradiated with negative pi mesons and with X rays in order to determine the RBE for early epidermal and later dermal damage. Late fibrosis was not studied. Four, 7, 9 and 10 fractions were used. An estimate of the RBE was made from the reactions on each pig for both early and late damage so that interanimal variability would be avoided. The data were also averaged to obtain mean dose response curves. There was no tendency for higher RBE's for late than for early skin damage. These pig studies have demonstrated an RBE of about 1.5 for early epidermal reactions and a slightly lower RBE (approximately 1.4) for later dermal damage in the same animals. This indicates that at doses of about 2.0 to 3.5 Gy pions, the medium wave skin damage is unlikely to be more severe than would be predicted from the early skin reactions and the accumulated clinical experience with X rays. However, if the trend to a steeper slope for the RBE versus dose per fraction for late injury is correct, as indicated by other published studies a relative increase in the late injury might be expected if much lower doses per fraction are used. The present clinical studies at Vancouver using 15 X 2.1 Gy pions indicate that an RBE of 1.5 is appropriate for epithelia, brain and colorectum.",Included
2403,"Effects of Preoperative Simulation on Minimally Invasive Hybrid Lumbar Interbody Fusion OBJECTIVE: The main focus of this study was to evaluate how preoperative simulation affects the surgical work flow, radiation exposure, and outcome of minimally invasive hybrid lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-HLIF).METHODS: A total of 132 patients who underwent single-level MIS-HLIF were enrolled in a cohort study design. Dose area product was analyzed in addition to surgical data. Once preoperative simulation was established, 66 cases (SIM cohort) were compared with 66 patients who had previously undergone MIS-HLIF without preoperative simulation (NO-SIM cohort).RESULTS: Dose area product was reduced considerably in the SIM cohort (320 cGy.cm<sup>2</sup> NO-SIM cohort: 470 cGy.cm<sup>2</sup>; P < 0.01). Surgical time was shorter for the SIM cohort (155 minutes; NO-SIM cohort, 182 minutes; P < 0.05). SIM cohort had a better outcome in Numeric Rating Scale back at 6 months follow-up compared with the NO-SIM cohort (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative simulation reduced radiation exposure and resulted in less back pain at the 6 months follow-up time point.

1848,"Initial clinical experience of a prototype ultra-high-resolution CT for assessment of small intracranial arteries Purpose: Diagnostic and neurosurgical procedures require the precise localization of small intracranial arteries, but this may be difficult using conventional computed tomography angiography (CTA). This study was conducted to evaluate the quality of CTA images acquired using a prototype ultra-high-resolution computed tomography (U-HRCT) system compared with those acquired using a conventional computed tomography (C-CT) system. Material(s) and Method(s): From July through September 2015, 10 adult patients (6 women and 4 men) previously scanned by C-CT were examined using U-HRCT to locate and assess cerebral aneurysms. The bilateral ophthalmic artery (Opth A), anterior choroidal artery (Acho A), and thalamoperforating arteries (TPAs) were visually evaluated in randomly presented CTA images. Images were graded on a 5-point scale, and differences in scores between U-HRCT and C-CT were evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Visual evaluation scores for images of the Opth A, Acho A, and TPAs were significantly higher for U-HRCT than for C-CT. U-HRCT images achieved good visualization (score > 3) for C-CT images with poor visualization (score < 3) in 66.7-100% of all the small arteries. Conclusion(s): U-HRCT is superior to C-CT for detecting and evaluating clinically significant small intracranial arteries. Copyright © 2019, Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded
543,"Susceptibility-weighted imaging of the venous networks around the brain stem Introduction: The venous network of the brainstem is complex and significant. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a practical technique which is sensitive to veins, especially tiny veins. Our purpose of this study was to evaluate the visualization of the venous network of brainstem by using SWI at 3.0 T. Method(s): The occurrence rate of each superficial veins of brainstem was evaluated by using SWI on a 3 T MR imaging system in 60 volunteers. The diameter of the lateral mesencephalic vein and peduncular vein were measured by SWI using the reconstructed mIP images in the sagittal view. And the outflow of the veins of brainstem were studied and described according to the reconstructed images. Result(s): The median anterior pontomesencephalic vein, median anterior medullary vein, peduncular vein, right vein of the pontomesencephalic sulcus, and right lateral anterior pontomesencephalic vein were detected in all the subjects (100 %). The outer diameter of peduncular vein was 1.38 +/- 0.26 mm (range 0.8-1.8 mm). The lateral mesencephalic vein was found in 75 % of the subjects and the mean outer diameter was 0.81 +/- 0.2 mm (range 0.5-1.2 mm). The inner veins of mesencephalon were found by using SWI. Conclusion(s): The venous networks around the brain stem can be visualized by SWI clearly.

3084,"Post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and prolonged use of immunosuppressant Post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma is an uncommon and fatal post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Such lymphomas have been described in only a few case series in the literature. The incidence of this condition is rising with improved survival after organ transplantation. A case of post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma in a young Chinese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus is described here. She presented with right-sided weakness and memory loss after tooth extraction 2 weeks before admission. Contrast computed tomography of the brain demonstrated a contrast rim-enhancing lesion over the left frontal lobe. With a history of recent dental procedure, long-term immunosuppressive therapy and computed tomography findings, cerebral abscess was highly suspected. Emergency operation was performed. Histopathology showed post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma, with cells positive for B-cell marker CD20. Immunosuppressant was stopped and she was treated with radiotherapy and rituximab (anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody). She remained diseasefree at 16 months. Post-transplantation primary central nervous system lymphoma is rare with variable presentation and radiological features. We believe rituximab may have a role in the treatment of such lymphomas.

1185,"Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields in relation to leukemia and brain tumors: a case-control study in Sweden Occupational exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) was studied in 250 leukemia patients and 261 brain-tumor cases, diagnosed in 1983-87 and compared with a control group of 1,121 randomly selected men, from the mid-region of Sweden, 1983-87. We based the exposure assessment on measurements from 1,015 different workplaces. On the basis of the job held longest during the 10-year period before diagnosis, we found an association between the average, daily, mean level of EMF and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The risk increased with increasing level of exposure. The odds ratios (OR) and the 95 percent confidence interval (CI) for three consecutive levels of exposure were: 1.1 (CI = 0.5-2.3); 2.2 (CI = 1.1-4.3); 3.0 (CI = 1.6-5.8), respectively. No association was observed for acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 1.0, CI = 0.5-1.8; OR = 0.8, CI = 0.4-1.6; OR = 1.0, CI = 0.6-1.9). For brain tumors, the corresponding risk estimates were 1.0 (CI = 0.7-1.6); 1.5 (CI = 1.0-2.2); 1.4 (CI = 0.9-2.1). Different EMF indices were tested. Tasks with frequent or large variations between high and low field-densities (high standard deviation) were more common among CLL subjects. For brain tumors, a prolonged high level (high median values) showed the strongest association. Confounding by place of residence, smoking, benzene, ionizing radiation, pesticides, and solvents was evaluated, and these factors did not seem to have a decisive influence on the associations. We also analyzed other potential sources of bias. For CLL, there were indications of an excess number of low-exposure subjects among non-responders, which, to some extent, may have enhanced but not caused the risk estimates obtained.

Patients were matched for WHO histological grade, performance status and age from a cohort of patients treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy to a dose of 60Gy in 30 fractions in an Medical Research Council (MRC) BR05 trial.RESULTS: Patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy had a median survival of 5 months with a 1-year survival rate of 12% from diagnosis. The median survival of case-matched controls was estimated to be 2.5-4.5 months longer. Following hypofractionated radiotherapy, Barthel score was improved or remained stable in 68% of patients.CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated partial brain radiotherapy is a well-tolerated regimen with palliative benefit. Comparison with matched controls suggests lesser survival benefit than would be obtained with radical radiotherapy. However, this is compensated by lower intensity and duration of irradiation induced side effects. It is postulated that there may not be a significant difference in good quality survival or 'quality adjusted survival' between the two regimens and this requires testing in prospective trials.",Excluded

2130,"Emerging locoregional therapy Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT): SIRT, or radioembolization, delivers yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres via a catheter in the hepatic artery to treat intra-hepatic disease. SIRT takes advantage of the fact that the blood supply for much of the normal liver parenchyma arrives through the portal circulation, while tumors are preferentially fed by the arterial system. Glass- or resin-based microspheres tagged with Y-90 are delivered typically in a ""lobar"" fashion and preferentially distribute into the tumoral and peritumoral vasculature, thereby delivering a high radiation dose (>100 Gy). Because Y-90 is a beta emitter, the effect is relatively selective and mostly affects only the metastatic sites while sparing normal liver parenchyma. The two currently available Y-90 products include SIR-spheres and TheraSphere. SIR-spheres deliver a higher dose per treatment and are more embolic. In contrast, the TheraSphere product delivers a higher specific radioactivity dose per microsphere allowing for smaller dose per treatment and are not as embolic. Both products have been shown to be welltolerated. SIRT can be an effective therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as metastatic colorectal or neuroendocrine liver disease.",Excluded
3414,"Adaptive replanning strategies accounting for shrinkage in head and neck IMRT PURPOSE: Significant anatomic and volumetric changes occur in head and neck cancer patients during fractionated radiotherapy, and the actual dose can be considerably different from the original plan. The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the differences between planned and delivered dose, (2) to investigate margins required for anatomic changes, and (3) to find optimal replanning strategies.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eleven patients, each with one planning and six weekly helical CTs, were included. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans were generated using the simultaneous integrated boost technique. Weekly CTs were rigidly registered to planning CT before deformable registration was performed. The following replanning strategies were investigated with different margins (0, 3, 5 mm): midcourse (one replan), every other week (two replans), and every week (six replans). Doses were accumulated on the planning CT for comparison of various dose indices for target and critical structures.RESULTS: The cumulative doses to targets were preserved even at the 0-mm margin. Doses to cord, brainstem, and mandible were unchanged. Significant increases in parotid doses were observed. Margin reduction from 5 to 0 mm led to a 22% improvement in parotid mean dose. Parotid sparing could be preserved with replanning. More frequent replanning led to better preservation; replanning more than once a week is unnecessary.CONCLUSION: Shrinkage does not result in significant dosimetric difference in targets and critical structures, except for the parotid gland, for which the mean dose increases by approximately 10%. The benefit of replanning is improved sparing of the parotid. The combination of replanning and reduced margins can provide up to a 30% difference in parotid dose.",Excluded

The extent of retinal damage was determined histologically. Daily exposure to bright light in the morning produced greater photoreceptor loss than daily afternoon exposure. Severe retinal damage was partially prevented by brief light adaptation (20 minutes duration, at 1.4 log ftc intensity) before the onset of morning exposure. However, light adaptation did not remove the differential effect of time of day.

In this study, we have evaluated the importance of the TCR pathway in the induction of chromosomal aberrations and apoptosis in isogenic Chinese hamster cell lines, which differ in TCR efficiency. AA8 is the parental cell line, which is proficient in the genome overall repair of UV-C radiation induced 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP) and the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) from the transcribing strand of active genes. UV61 cells (hamster homologue of human Cockayne's syndrome (CS) group B cells) originally isolated from AA8, exhibit proficient repair of 6-4 PP but are deficient in CPD removal by the TCR pathway. Upon UV-C irradiation of cells in G1-phase, UV61 showed a dramatic increase in apoptotic response as compared to AA8 cells. Abolition of TCR by treatment with alpha-amanitin (an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II) in AA8 cells also resulted in an elevated apoptotic response like that observed in UV61 cells treated with UV alone. This suggests that the lack of TCR is largely responsible for increased apoptotic response in UV61 cells. Furthermore, the chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induced by UV were also found to be higher in UV61 cells than in TCR proficient AA8 cells. This study shows that the increased chromosomal aberrations and apoptotic death in UV61 cells is due to their inability to remove CPD from the transcribing strand of active genes and suggests a protective role for TCR in the prevention of both chromosomal aberrations and apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis and time-course appearance of apoptotic cells suggest that the conversion of UV-DNA damage into chromosomal aberrations precedes and determines the apoptotic process.",Excluded

We therefore hypothesized that specific white matter tracts would be associated with poorer prognosis based on their connection to primitive brain regions necessary for essential life functions. We also hypothesized that tumors in these regions treated with bevacizumab would alter patient survival. METHOD(S): 109 subjects with primary GBM tumors were retrospectively included in this study. Voxel-wise survival analyses were performed to test for spatial and treatment dependence of GBM survival prognosis. An intersection analysis was first performed between an enhancing tumor mask and template-space diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived tractography which highlighted voxels with tumor-intersecting white matter tracts. Maps of voxels with these tracts were made for each patient. A voxel-wise Kaplan-Meier test was performed comparing the survival times of patients with and without a tumor-intersecting white matter tract in that voxel. The same analysis was implemented to compare survival of participants with and without bevacizumab. This highlighted regions where survival was effected due to anti-VEGF treatment. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to validate the observed survival differences induced by bevacizumab considering inconsistencies in treatment regimens seen in the patient population. RESULT(S): Glioblastoma patients with tumors intersecting the right anterior thalamic radiation, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral corticospinal tracts, and corpus callosum have decreased survival compared to those with tumors intersecting elsewhere. Patients treated with bevacizumab and who also had tumors intersecting the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, or the thalamic radiations were found to be at a survival advantage when compared to those who did not receive bevacizumab.

2196,"Small Cell Lung Cancer: Therapies and Targets Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a fatal disease due to limited therapeutic options. Systemic chemotherapy is the bedrock of treatment for both the limited and extensive stages of the disease. However, the established management paradigm of platinum-based chemotherapy has reached an efficacy plateau. A modest survival improvement, approximately 5%, was witnessed with the addition of cranial or thoracic radiation to systemic chemotherapy. Other strategies to improve outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in the last two decades have met with minimal success. The substitution of irinotecan for etoposide in the frontline treatment of SCLC achieved significant efficacy benefit in Japanese patients, but similar benefit could not be reproduced in other patient populations. Salvage treatment for recurrent or progressive SCLC is particularly challenging, where topotecan remains the only agent with regulatory approval to date. Ongoing evaluation of biologic agents targeting angiogenesis, sonic hedgehog pathway, DNA repair pathway, and immune checkpoint modulators hold some promise for improved outcome in SCLC.

Radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis is associated with permanent neurological deficits and occasionally progresses to death.OBJECTIVE: We present our experience with surgery on radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis (RTLN) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with special consideration of clinical presentation, surgical technique, and outcomes.METHOD: This retrospective study includes 12 patients with RTLN treated by the senior author between January 2010 and December 2014. Patients initially sought medical treatment due to headache; other symptoms were hearing loss, visual deterioration, seizure, hemiparesis, vertigo, memory loss and agnosia. A temporal approach through a linear incision was performed for all cases. RTLN was found in one side in 7 patients, and bilaterally in 5. 4 patients underwent resection of necrotic tissue bilaterally and 8 patients on one side.RESULTS: No death occurred in this series of cases. There were no post-operative complications, except 1 patient who developed aseptic meningitis. All 12 patients were free from headache. No seizure occurred in patients with preoperative epilepsy. Other symptoms such as hemiparesis and vertigo improved in all patients. Memory loss, agnosia and hearing loss did not change post-operatively in all cases. The follow-up MR images demonstrated no recurrence of necrotic lesions in all 12 patients.CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical intervention through a temporal approach with linear incision is warranted in patients with radiation induced temporal lobe necrosis with significant symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure, minimum space occupying effect on imaging, or neurological deterioration despite conservative management.",Excluded

To understand extravasation kinetics and extravascular organ concentrations of AlbudAbs in humans, we studied tissue distribution and elimination of a non-conjugated <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled AlbudAb in healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Method(s): A non-conjugated AlbudAb (GSK3128349) was radiolabeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr and a single 1 mg (~ 15 MBq) dose intravenously administered to eight healthy males. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb tissue distribution was followed for up to 7 days with four whole-body PET/CT scans. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb tissue concentrations were quantified in organs of therapeutic significance, measuring standardized uptake value and tissue/plasma ratios. Plasma pharmacokinetics were assessed by gamma counting and LC-MS/MS of blood samples. Result(s): <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb administration and PET/CT procedures were well tolerated, with no drug-related immunogenicity or adverse events. <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb rapidly distributed throughout the vasculature, with tissue/plasma ratios in the liver, lungs, and heart relatively stable over 7 days post-dose, ranging between 0.1 and 0.5. The brain tissue/plasma ratio of 0.025 suggested minimal AlbudAb blood-brain barrier penetration. Slowly increasing ratios in muscle, testis, pancreas, and spleen reflected either slow AlbudAb penetration and/or <sup>89</sup>Zr residualization in these organs. Across all tissues evaluated, the kidney tissue/plasma ratio was highest (0.5-1.5 range) with highest concentration in the renal cortex. The terminal half-life of the <sup>89</sup>Zr-AlbudAb was 18 days.

OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: In phase 1, 24 patients were enrolled. The MTD established was 5 mg/kg, given intravenously 5 days a week for the first 10 RT fractions, then 3 times a week for the duration of RT. The 7 patients enrolled in the third dose level and the 94 enrolled in phase 2 received this dose. Of these 101 patients, 87 were eligible and evaluable. Median survival time was 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.9-17.6 months), not significantly different from that of the historical control (P=.36). Median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.7-9.6 months). One patient (1%) experienced a grade 5 adverse event possibly related to therapy during the concurrent phase, and none experience toxicity during adjuvant TMZ therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment was well tolerated, but median OS did not reach improvement specified by protocol compared to historical control, indicating that the combination of standard RT with TMZ and MGd did not achieve a significant survival advantage.",Excluded

978,"Low Dose Radiation Therapy, Particularly with 0.5 Gy, Improves Pain in Degenerative Joint Disease of the Fingers: Results of a Retrospective Analysis Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) has been successfully established for decades as an alternative analgesic treatment option for patients suffering from chronic degenerative and inflammatory diseases. In this study, 483 patients were undergoing LDRT for degenerative joint disease of the fingers and thumb at the University Hospital Erlangen between 2004 and 2019. Radiotherapy was applied according to the German guidelines for LDRT. Several impact factors on therapeutic success, such as the age and gender, the number of affected fingers, the single and cumulative dose, as well as the number of series, were investigated. In summary, 70% of the patients showed an improvement of their pain following LDRT. No significant impact was found for the factors age, gender, the number of series or the cumulative dosage. Patients with an involvement of the thumb showed a significantly worse outcome compared to patients with an isolated affection of the fingers. In this cohort, patients receiving a single dose of 0.5 Gy reported a significantly better outcome than patients receiving 1.0 Gy, strongly suggesting a reduction in the total dose. In summary, LDRT is a good alternative treatment option for patients suffering from degenerative and inflammatory joint disease of the fingers.",Excluded
207,"Differential responses to NMDA receptor activation in rat hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells may underlie enhanced pyramidal cell vulnerability Hippocampal interneurons are generally more resistant than pyramidal cells to excitotoxic insults. Because NMDA receptors play a crucial role in neurodegeneration, we have compared the response to exogenous NMDA in CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons of the stratum oriens using combined whole-cell patch-clamp recording and ratiometric Ca2+ imaging. In voltage-clamp, current-clamp or in nominally Mg2+-free medium, NMDA (10 microM; 3-5 min exposure in the presence of tetrodotoxin) induced a markedly larger inward current and Ca2+ rise in pyramidal cells than in interneurons. Pyramidal cells also showed a more pronounced voltage dependence in their response to NMDA. We hypothesized that this enhanced response to NMDA receptor activation in pyramidal cells could underlie their increased vulnerability to excitotoxicity. Using loss of dye as an indicator of degenerative membrane disruption, interneurons tolerated continuous exposure to a high concentration of NMDA (30 microM) for longer periods than pyramidal cells. This acute neurodegeneration in pyramidal cells was independent of intracellular Ca2+, because high intracellular BAPTA (20 mM) did not prolong survival time. Thus, a plausible explanation for the enhanced sensitivity of pyramidal neurons to excitotoxic insults associated with cerebral ischemia is their greater response to NMDA receptor activation, which may reflect differences in NMDA receptor expression and/or subunit composition.",Excluded
3594,"Disrupted resting-state functional architecture of the brain after 45-day simulated microgravity Long-term spaceflight induces both physiological and psychological changes in astronauts. To understand the neural mechanisms underlying these physiological and psychological changes, it is critical to investigate the effects of microgravity on the functional architecture of the brain. In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to study whether the functional architecture of the brain is altered after 45 days of -6degree head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest, which is a reliable model for the simulation of microgravity. Sixteen healthy male volunteers underwent rs-fMRI scans before and after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Specifically, we used a commonly employed graph-based measure of network organization, i.e., degree centrality (DC), to perform a full-brain exploration of the regions that were influenced by simulated microgravity. We subsequently examined the functional connectivities of these regions using a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis. We found decreased DC in two regions, the left anterior insula (aINS) and the anterior part of the middle cingulate cortex (MCC; also called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in many studies), in the male volunteers after 45 days of -6degree HDT bed rest. Furthermore, seed-based RSFC analyses revealed that a functional network anchored in the aINS and MCC was particularly influenced by simulated microgravity. These results provide evidence that simulated microgravity alters the resting-state functional architecture of the brains of males and suggest that the processing of salience information, which is primarily subserved by the aINS-MCC functional network, is particularly influenced by spaceflight. The current findings provide a new perspective for understanding the relationships between microgravity, cognitive function, autonomic neural function, and central neural activity.",Excluded
2085,"Combined endoscopic endonasal surgery and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (fSRS) for complex cranial base tumors-early clinical outcomes Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has been shown to be a feasible approach to cranial base tumors while reducing post-operative morbidity. Using the endoscopic endonasal approach alone or in combination with open approaches may provide advantages over conventional approaches. However, the balance between maximal resection and minimal injury to neurovascular structures frequently precludes gross total resection (GTR). Consequently, adjuvant radiation therapy may be an important option to improve local control (LC) of residual disease. In this retrospective series, we report clinical outcomes, morbidity, and LC of 40 patients with cranial base tumors treated with EES +/- combined open approach followed by fSRS (CyberKnife, Accuray Inc.). 26 patients had benign disease, 7 had newly diagnosed malignant disease, and 7 had previously resected malignant disease. Surgical outcomes were evaluable in all patients. LC after fSRS was evaluable in 39 patients and defined as no evidence of regrowth by MRI, CT, & physical examination. GTR was achieved in 12/40. Median post-operative length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. In multivariable analysis controlling for anatomic location and malignant histology, post-operative complications (n = 10) were significantly associated with patients having combined open and EES (p < 0.01, OR = 16.9). SRS was delivered in 1-5 sessions to a median marginal dose of 24.9 Gy. Median follow-up was 24.7 months (range, 1.5 to 61 months). LC was achieved in 89.7% (35/39) of evaluable patients. LC was achieved in 11/12 patients who had GTR. Median progression-free survival was 19.7 months (21.0 months for benign tumors (n = 26), 5.8 months for previously resected malignant disease (n = 7), and 21.2 months for newly diagnosed malignant disease (n = 7). Of the 31 patients who had symptomatic disease at presentation, 18 (58%) reported complete symptom resolution, 9 partial, and 4 no improvement. One patient who received two prior courses of radiation therapy developed osteosclerosis (grade III). Other adverse events were erythema (grade I, n = 5), nausea (grade II, n = 2), conjunctivitis (grade II, n = 1). EES followed by fSRS is a safe and effective management strategy for selected cranial base tumors. EES combined with an open surgical approach may result in increased complications. However, initial follow-up offers encouraging results indicating shorter time to recovery, acceptable LC rates compared to conventional approaches, and similar median time to progression for benign and newly diagnosed malignant disease.",Excluded
291,"Photoinactivation of an identified motoneurone in the locust Locusta migratoria 1. The common inhibitory motoneurone 1 (CI1) in the mesothoracic ganglion of the locust was photoinactivated using a helium-cadmium laser or a mercury lamp as light source. Treated animals showed no signs of abnormal locomotory behaviour over periods of up to 40 days. 2. Photoinactivation of part of the neurone in the ganglion, i.e. the soma and the primary neurite, is sufficient to cause irreversible degeneration of all the peripheral extensions of the neurone. Three weeks after photoinactivation, all GABA immunoreactivity had disappeared from the axon branches of the photoinactivated neurone and from their terminals on one of the target muscles investigated, the anterior coxa rotator M92, and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials could no longer be elicited through stimulation. This was taken as proof of functional denervation of the muscle with regard to its inhibitory input. By this time, the axon of CI1 in nerve N3C1, which supplies M92, had also disappeared. 3. Animals treated during the fourth or fifth instars showed a permanent loss of the photoinactivated mesothoracic CI1 neurone after moulting into adulthood. 4. Denervation of M92 in the middle legs of instars and adults by axotomy of N3 always led to rapid functional reinnervation of the muscle. The first sign of reinnervation (excitatory neuromuscular activity upon mechanical stimulation of the tarsi) was detected electrophysiologically as early as 8 days after severing the motor nerve. 5. The elimination of CI1 by photoinactivation for a period of up to 40 days did not influence parameters of the target muscle, such as size, number of fibres and phenotypes of fibres defined histochemically according to their myofibrillar ATPase isoforms, irrespective of whether the operation was performed in instars or adults. Similarly, the short period of denervation following axotomy before reinnervation took place did not affect the fibre type composition of the muscle.",Excluded

1851,"Comparing survival predicted by the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) to actual survival in patients with 1-10 brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple prognostic models for predicting survival after treatment for brain metastases have been developed. One of them, the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA), has been developed to predict the median survival for brain metastases from the most frequent primary sites: lung carcinoma, breast cancer, melanoma, renal cell cancer and gastrointestinal tumours. In this study we aim to compare the survival predicted by the DS-GPA to actual survival, and to assess this models performance on both population and individual levels.METHODS: We identified a consecutive cohort of patients treated with SRS for brain metastases in our institute. DS-GPA scores were calculated for each patient, and the median survival for each DS-GPA group was calculated. Differences in survival between DS-GPA groups were tested with Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and log-rank tests.RESULTS: In total 367 patients were included in the analysis. Median survival in our cohort is largely comparable to corresponding DS-GPA cohorts, but some notable differences are present. There was a significantly shorter median survival (15.4months, compared to 26.5months) in the adenocarcinoma NSCLC subgroup with a GPA score of 2.3-3. We confirmed the significant differences in survival time for most cancer-specific subgroups.CONCLUSION: DS-GPA seems to be a reliable tool to classify patients with brain metastases treated with SRS into prognostic subgroups. However, we found some aberrations from predicted median survival times, which may be due to specific characteristics of the populations of patients treated with SRS versus other patients.",Excluded
537,"Neuronavigation role in the percutaneous treatment of thoracolumbar fractures Introduction: Application of the neuronavigation techniques to the widely used percutaneous pedicle screw techniques allows to combine the traditional AP and LL intraoperatory fluoroscopy images with three-dimensional reconstruction CT images. The surgeon have very important informations about the axial plane having a real time feedback to the exact spinal surgical anatomy. This makes more ""minimally invasive"" surgical procedure and reduces patients and operators exposure to ionizing radiation. We used this technique in the treatment of Magerl's A2-A3 thoracolumbar fracture. Material(s) and Method(s): From June 2010 thru September 2012, 25 patients (16 male and 9 female) underwent surgical treatment for thoracolumbar hinge (D12-L1) fracture with a completely neuronavigated percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique using a posterior approach. Inclusions criteria were: monolevel Magerl's A2- A3 thoracolumbar fractures, no posterior wall involvement and/or fragments occupying the spinal canal for more than 25 % according to Hashimoto, McCormack score <=6 with posterior longitudinal ligament's integrity, no neurological deficits. Although the percutaneous neuronavigated techniques are widely used in different centers, in these cases also the pedicle screws were neuronavigated, to make surgical procedure more accurate and precise. The positioning of percutaneous pedicle screw was performed using Stealth 7 Medtronic (Fridley, Minnesota, USA) neuronavigation system with a completely neuronavigated surgical instruments (CD Horizon Longitude) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). In 2 cases we used real-time 3-D images acquired with O-Arm system to have a further collimation of the neuronavigated data with the acquired images reducing intraoperative fluoroscopic controls. The follow-up provided Rx study in second post-operative day and in 1 and 6 months post-op. Result(s): The percutaneous neuronavigated technique have proved to be useful for the surgeon because in addition to the traditional fluoroscopic AP and LL images, uses three-dimensional reconstruction CT images, viewing also axial projections. In cases in which we used the O-Arm, were appreciated the usefulness of the 3-D images realtime. There were no cases of surgical instrumentation's failure. The patients have been mobilized in the first post-operative day with a more rapid resolution of painful symptoms and returned to perform their work activities more quickly. The Rx post-operative controls at 6 months have demonstrated the correct positioning of the pedicle screws and the correct fusion in 95 % of patients. Conclusion(s): The percutaneously entirely neuronavigated pedicle screws fixation is an effective and safe technique for the treatment of the hinge thoraco-lumbar fractures. The technique used in carefully selected patients reduces the time required for surgery, intraoperative blood loss, and ensures greater anatomical detail making more safely the placement of pedicle screws reducing the risks of ""screw misplacement"".",Excluded
2757,"Optimizing cancer radiotherapy with 2-deoxy-D-glucose: Dose escalation studies in patients with glioblastoma multiforme Background and Purpose: Higher rates of glucose utilization and glycolysis generally correlate with poor prognosis in several types of malignant tumors. Own earlier studies on model systems demonstrated that the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) could enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in a dose-dependent manner by selectively sensitizing cancer cells while protecting normal cells. Phase I/II clinical trials indicated that the combination of 2-DG, at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg body weight (BW), with large fractions of gamma-radiation was well tolerated in cerebral glioma patients. Since higher 2-DG doses are expected to improve the therapeutic gain, present studies were undertaken to examine the tolerance and safety of escalating 2-DG dose during combined treatment (2-DG + radiotherapy) in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Patients and Methods: Untreated patients with histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme (WHO criteria) were included in the study. Seven weekly fractions of <sup>60</sup>Co gamma-rays (5 Gy/fraction) were delivered to the tumor volume (presurgical CT/MRI evaluation) plus 3 cm margin. Escalating 2-DG doses (200-250-300 mg/kg BW) were administered orally 30 min before irradiation after overnight fasting. Acute toxicity and tolerance were studied by monitoring the vital parameters and side effects. Late radiation damage and treatment responses were studied radiologically and clinically in surviving patients. Result(s): Transient side effects similar to hypoglycemia were observed in most of the patients. Tolerance and patient compliance to the combined treatment were very good up to a 2-DG dose of 250 mg/kg BW. However, at the higher dose of 300 mg/kg BW, two out of six patients were very restless and could not complete treatment, though significant changes in the vital parameters were not observed even at this dose. No significant damage to the normal brain tissue was observed during follow-up in seven out of ten patients who received complete treatment and survived between 11 and 46 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Oral administration of 2-DG combined with large fractions of radiation (5 Gy/fraction/week) is safe and could be tolerated in glioblastoma patients without any acute toxicity and late radiation damage to the normal brain. Further clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of the combined treatment are warranted. © Urban & Vogel.",Excluded

These effects were associated with an increase in poly([adenosine diphosphate]-ribose) polymerase cleavage, sub-G1 arrest, and annexin V staining, consistent with apoptotic cell death; however, the pancaspase inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone failed to reverse anacardic acid-induced cell death, suggesting a possible nonclassical apoptotic mechanism. Anacardic acid also reduced the expression of survivin and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, antiapoptotic proteins associated with cellular survival and radioresistance, and radiosensitized pituitary adenoma cells.CONCLUSIONS: These findings warrant further exploration of anacardic acid as a single agent or as an adjunct to radiation therapy for the treatment of pituitary tumors.",Excluded
3195,"Role of nanomedicine in treatment of brain cancer Background: Drug delivery to cancerous brain is a challenging task as it is surrounded by an efficient protective barrier. The main hurdles for delivery of bioactive molecules to cancerous brain are blood brain barrier (BBB), the invasive nature of gliomas, drug resistance, and difficult brain interstitium transportation. Therefore, treatment of brain cancer with the available drug regimen is difficult and has shown little improvement in recent years. Method(s): We searched about recent advancements in the use of nanomedicine for effective treatment of the brain cancer. We focused on the use of liposomes, nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers to improve brain cancer therapy. Result(s): Nanomedicines are well suited for the treatment of brain cancer owing to their highly acceptable biological, chemical, and physical properties. Smaller size of nanomedicines also enhances their anticancer potential and penetration into blood brain barrier (BBB). Conclusion(s): Recently, nanomedicine based approaches have been developed and investigated for effective treatment of brain cancer. Some of these have been translated into clinical practice, in order to attain therapeutic needs of gliomas. Future advancements in nanomedicines will likely produce significant changes in methods and practice of brain cancer therapy. Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.",Excluded
3375,"Radiation-induced astrogliosis and blood-brain barrier damage can be abrogated using anti-TNF treatment PURPOSE: In this article, we investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in the initiation of acute damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain tissue following radiotherapy (RT) for CNS tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intravital microscopy and a closed cranial window technique were used to measure quantitatively BBB permeability to FITC-dextran 4.4-kDa molecules, leukocyte adhesion (Rhodamine-6G) and vessel diameters before and after 20-Gy cranial radiation with and without treatment with anti-TNF. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify astrogliosis post-RT and immunofluorescence was used to visualize protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 post-RT. Recombinant TNF (rTNF) was used to elucidate the role of TNF in leukocyte adhesion and vessel diameter.RESULTS: Mice treated with anti-TNF showed significantly lower permeability and leukocyte adhesion at 24 and 48 h post-RT vs. RT-only animals. We observed a significant decrease in arteriole diameters at 48 h post-RT that was inhibited in TNF-treated animals. We also saw a significant increase in activated astrocytes following RT that was significantly lower in the anti-TNF-treated group. In addition, immunofluorescence showed protein expression of TNF and ICAM-1 in the cerebral cortex that was inhibited with anti-TNF treatment. Finally, administration of rTNF induced a decrease in arteriole diameter and a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion in venules and arterioles.CONCLUSIONS: TNF plays a significant role in acute changes in BBB permeability, leukocyte adhesion, arteriole diameter, and astrocyte activation following cranial radiation. Treatment with anti-TNF protects the brain's microvascular network from the acute damage following RT.",Included

However, experimental and clinical data show evidence of peripheral nerve injury after radiation therapy. The physiopathology remains unclear. Vascular alterations appear to play an important role. Direct damage to axon or Schwann cell and nervous compression in areas of radiation fibrosis could also be involved. Clinically, brachial plexopathy is a well-recognized complication but all the structures of the peripheral nervous system can be involved: cranial nerves, roots, plexus and nerve trunks. A syndrome of early and reversible plexopathy differs from the classical progressive form with pejorative outcome. Radiation-induced peripheral nerve tumors are infrequent.

2631,"Missense mutations but not allelic variants alter the function of ATM by dominant interference in patients with breast cancer The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and an elevated risk of malignancy. Epidemiological data support an increased risk for breast and other cancers in A-T heterozygotes. However, screening breast cancer cases for truncating mutations in the ATM (A-T mutated) gene has failed largely to reveal an increased incidence in these patients. It has been hypothesized that ATM missense mutations are implicated in breast cancer, and there is some evidence to support this. The presence of a large variety of rare missense variants in addition to common polymorphisms in ATM makes it difficult to establish such a relationship by association studies. To investigate the functional significance of these changes we have introduced missense substitutions, identified in either A-T or breast cancer patients, into ATM cDNA before establishing stable cell lines to determine their effect on ATM function. Pathogenic missense mutations and neutral missense variants were distinguished initially by their capacity to correct the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells. Furthermore missense mutations abolished the radiation-induced kinase activity of ATM in normal control cells, caused chromosome instability, and reduced cell viability in irradiated control cells, whereas neutral variants failed to do so. Mutant ATM was expressed at the same level as endogenous protein, and interference with normal ATM function seemed to be by multimerization. This approach represents a means of identifying genuine ATM mutations and addressing the significance of missense changes in the ATM gene in a variety of cancers including breast cancer.",Excluded
2562,"Bevacizumab, temozolomide, and radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma: comprehensive safety results during and after first-line therapy BACKGROUND: The proposed use of bevacizumab with radiotherapy/temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma raised potential safety concerns. Bevacizumab has been linked with stroke, bleeding events, and wound-healing complications in other tumor types; these events are of particular concern for glioblastoma (highly vascular tumors that are usually resected). Published data on the interaction of bevacizumab with radiotherapy/temozolomide are also limited. We report safety data from a phase III randomized trial (Avastin in Glioblastoma), focusing on these considerations.METHODS: Eligible patients received: radiotherapy and temozolomide plus bevacizumab/placebo, 6 cycles; a 4-week treatment break; temozolomide plus bevacizumab/placebo, 6 cycles; and bevacizumab/placebo until progression. Data on adverse events (AEs) were collected throughout.RESULTS: Bevacizumab-treated patients (n = 461) had a longer median safety follow-up time (12.3 vs 8.5 mo), and a higher proportion completed 6 cycles of maintenance temozolomide (64.6% vs 36.9%) versus placebo (n = 450). The incidences of relevant AEs (bevacizumab vs placebo, respectively) were: arterial thromboembolic events (5.9% vs 1.6%); cerebral hemorrhage (3.3% vs 2.0%); wound-healing complications (6.9% vs 4.7%); thrombocytopenia (34.1% vs 27.3%); radiotherapy-associated skin injury (8.2% vs 9.3%); alopecia (39.0% vs 36.0%); gastrointestinal perforation (including gastrointestinal abscesses and fistulae, 1.7% vs 0.4%); and radiotherapy-associated injury (0.4% vs 0.0%). Overall, 15.8% and 23.8% of bevacizumab- and placebo-treated patients had surgery (including biopsy) after progression. Within 30 days of postprogression surgery, AE incidence was 10.9% (bevacizumab) and 23.4% (placebo).CONCLUSION: The safety profile was consistent with that expected from radiotherapy/temozolomide plus bevacizumab. The increased AE incidence with bevacizumab did not impact patients' ability to receive standard-of-care treatment or to undergo further surgery.",Excluded
3592,Irradiated normal brain promotes invasion of glioblastoma through vascular endothelial growth and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha The significance of irradiated normal brain volume in glioma recurrence is usually ignored by radiotherapists. The whole-brain irradiation (WBI) of 15 Gy in three fractions was delivered to C57BL/6 mice before implantation of GL261 glioma cells. The changes in vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) after WBI were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Cell invasion assays were performed to study the effects of VEGF and SDF-1alpha. The levels of VEGF and SDF-1alpha in normal brain tissues increased after 15 Gy WBI. The WBI before tumor implantation significantly increased the invasive ability of GL261 cells. VEGF and SDF-1alpha could promote invasion of GL261 cells even after high-dose irradiation. The combination of irradiation and inhibitors such as AMD3100 may prevent irradiation-stimulated dissemination of glioma cells.,Included

1373,"A clonogenic survival assay of neural stem cells in rat spinal cord after exposure to ionizing radiation Neural stem cells play an important role in neurogenesis of the adult central nervous system (CNS). Inhibition of neurogenesis has been suggested to be an underlying mechanism of radiation-induced CNS damage. Here we developed an in vivo/ in vitro clonogenic assay to characterize the survival of neural stem cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Cells were isolated from the rat cervical spinal cord and plated as single cell suspensions in defined medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The survival of the proliferating cells was determined by their ability to form neurosphere colonies. The number and size of neurospheres were analyzed quantitatively at day 10, 12, 14 and 16 after plating. Plating cells from 5, 10 and 15 mm of the cervical spinal cord resulted in a linear increase in the number of neurospheres from day 10-16. Compared to the nonirradiated spinal cord, there was a significant decrease in the number and size of neurosphere colonies cultured from a 10-mm length of the rat spinal cord after a single dose of 5 Gy. When dissociated neurospheres derived from a spinal cord that had been irradiated with 5 Gy were allowed to differentiate, the percentages of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as determined by immunocytohistochemistry were not altered compared to those from the nonirradiated spinal cord. Secondary neurospheres could be obtained from cells dissociated from primary neurospheres that had been cultured from the irradiated spinal cord. In conclusion, exposure to ionizing radiation reduces the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells cultured from the rat spinal cord. However, neural stem cells retain their pluripotent and self-renewing properties after irradiation. A neurosphere-based assay may provide a quantitative measure of the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells in the adult CNS after irradiation.",Included
1410,"Extremely Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields Promote In Vitro Neuronal Differentiation and Neurite Outgrowth of Embryonic Neural Stem Cells via Up-Regulating TRPC1 Exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice. However, little is focused on the effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neurogenesis. Here, we studied the potential effects of ELF-EMFs on embryonic neural stem cells (eNSCs). We exposed eNSCs to ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1 mT) for 1, 2, and 3 days with 4 hours per day. We found that eNSC proliferation and maintenance were significantly enhanced after ELF-EMF exposure in proliferation medium. ELF-EMF exposure increased the ratio of differentiated neurons and promoted the neurite outgrowth of eNSC-derived neurons without influencing astrocyes differentiation and the cell apoptosis. In addition, the expression of the proneural genes, NeuroD and Ngn1, which are crucial for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth, was increased after ELF-EMF exposure. Moreover, the expression of transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) was significantly up-regulated accompanied by increased the peak amplitude of intracellular calcium level induced by ELF-EMF. Furthermore, silencing TRPC1 expression eliminated the up-regulation of the proneural genes and the promotion of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth induced by ELF-EMF. These results suggest that ELF-EMF exposure promotes the neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth of eNSCs via up-regulation the expression of TRPC1 and proneural genes (NeuroD and Ngn1). These findings also provide new insights in understanding the effects of ELF-EMF exposure on embryonic brain development.",Excluded
2076,"Acute vision loss: A potential novel indication for intraarterial chemotherapy in the treatment of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (case report) Congress Abstract Introduction: The combination of radiotherapy and concomitant intraarterial cisplatin (RADPLAT) is well recognized in controlling locally invasive unresectable sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC). However, no reliable data are available for acute administration of intraarterial chemotherapy alone for palliation of acute vision loss in patients with unresectable SNUC involving the optic nerve. Objective(s): To suggest a novel indication for compassionate use of intraarterial chemotherapy alone in the acute setting in patients with advanced SNUC associated vision loss. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old Hispanic man presented with bloody nasal discharge, left proptosis, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. Both CT and MRI of the head and neck revealed a large 6.2-cm sinonasal mass extending through the cribriform plate to the dural, left maxillary sinus, and left orbit resulting proptosis with involvement of the optic nerve. The patient was not a surgical candidate due to intracranial extension with dural involvement. The patient's visual acuity in the left eye was 2400/20 on presentation. The patient underwent biopsy, which revealed SNUC. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning requires approximately 1 week to orchestrate at our institution. We decided to administer supratherapeutic intraarterial cisplatin acutely, along with thiosulfate infusion without radiation in an attempt to save the patient's vision. The patient experienced an increase in pain initially. However, over the following 5 days, the degree of proptosis diminished markedly and vision improved substantially without IMRT. The patient's follow-up vision testing revealed 30/20 vision in the left eye at 1 week and 20/20 vision at 2 weeks following therapy. Subsequent MRI revealed marked necrosis and decrease in size of the mass. Conclusion(s): Although we are not specifically advocating intraarterial administration of chemotherapy alone for the treatment of head and neck tumors, it may be effective in the acute setting for palliation of acute vision loss related to compression by head and neck tumors such as SNUC.",Excluded
1386,"Symptoms 10-17 years after breast cancer radiotherapy data from the randomised SWEBCG91-RT trial BACKGROUND: Postoperative radiotherapy decreases the risk for local recurrence and improves overall survival in women with breast cancer. We have limited information on radiotherapy-induced symptoms 10-17 years after therapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 1997, women with lymph node-negative breast cancer were randomised in a Swedish multi-institutional trial to breast conserving surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. In 2007, 10-17 years after randomisation, the group included 422 recurrence-free women. We collected data with a study-specific questionnaire on eight pre-selected symptom groups.RESULTS: For six symptom groups (oedema in breast or arm, erysipelas, heart symptoms, lung symptoms, rib fractures, and decreased shoulder mobility) we found similar occurrence in both groups. Excess occurrence after radiotherapy was observed for pain in the breast or in the skin, reported to occur ""occasionally"" by 38.1% of survivors having undergone radiotherapy and surgery versus 24.0% of those with surgery alone (absolute difference 14.1%; p=0.004) and at least once a week by 10.3% of the radiotherapy group versus 1.7% (absolute difference 8.6%; p=0.001). Daily life and analgesic use did not differ between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Ten to 17 years after postoperative radiotherapy 1 in 12 women had weekly pain that could be attributed to radiotherapy. The symptoms did not significantly affect daily life and thus the reduced risk for local recurrence seems to outweigh the risk for long-term symptoms for most women.",Included

450,"Local delivery of angiogenesis-inhibitor minocycline combined with radiotherapy and oral temozolomide chemotherapy in 9L glioma: Laboratory investigation Object. Over the past several years, there has been increasing interest in combining angiogenesis inhibitors with radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. Although the US FDA approved bevacizumab for the treatment of glioblastoma in 2009, the European Medicines Agency rejected its use due to its questionable impact on patient survival. One factor contributing to the failure of angiogenesis inhibitors to increase overall patient survival may be their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Here the authors examined in a 9L glioma model whether intracranial polymer-based delivery of the angiogenesis inhibitor minocycline potentiates the effects of both radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy in increasing median survival. The authors also investigated whether the relative timing of minocycline polymer implantation with respect to radiotherapy affects the efficacy of radiotherapy. Methods. Minocycline was incorporated into the biodegradable polymer polyanhydride poly(1,3-bis-[p-carboxyphenoxy propane]-co-[sebacic anhydride]) (CPP:SA) at a ratio of 50:50 by weight. Female Fischer 344 rats were implanted with 9L glioma on Day 0. The minocycline polymer was then implanted on either Day 3 or Day 5 posttumor implantation. Cohorts of rats were exposed to 20 Gy focal radiation on Day 5 or were administered oral temozolomide (50 mg/kg daily) on Days 5-9. Results. Both minocycline polymer implantations on Days 3 and 5 increased survival from 14 days to 19 days (p < 0.001 vs control). Treatment with a combination of both minocycline polymer and radiotherapy on Day 5 resulted in a 139% increase in median survival compared with treatment with radiotherapy alone (p < 0.005). There was not a statistically significant difference in median survival between the group that received minocycline implanted on the same day as radiotherapy and the group that received minocycline polymer 2 days prior to radiotherapy. Lastly, treatment with a combination of minocycline polymer with oral temozolomide resulted in a 38% extension of median survival compared with treatment of oral temozolomide alone (p < 0.001). Conclusions. These results show that minocycline delivered locally potentiates the effects of both radiotherapy and oral temozolomide in increasing median survival in a rodent glioma model. More generally, these results suggest that traditional therapy in combination with local, as opposed to systemic, delivery of angiogenesis inhibitors may be able to increase median survival for patients with glioblastoma. ©AANS, 2014.",Excluded

Case Description: A 54-year-old woman came to our department for convulsions and was admitted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a giant tumor in the skull base region, including the sphenoid sinus, pituitary fossa, right cavernous sinus, right middle fossa, and right basal ganglia. Mild left hemiparesis was noted. An ophthalmologic examination revealed left side homonymous hemianopsia. Using an endonasal endoscopic surgical approach, tumor removal was performed, with the residual tumor removed with a transcranial approach. Residual tumor tissue remained around the right cavernous sinus; therefore, SRT was performed 1 month after the second procedure, which resulted in good control of growth. Four years later, spontaneous CSF leakage occurred, for which endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed. One month later, CSF leakage recurred, and the same procedure was again used. A third episode of recurrent CSF leakage occurred 5 days later. A transcranial approach was finally used for repair, and the patient showed complete recovery. Conclusion(s): Late-onset CSF leakage after SRT for a pituitary adenoma can be intractable, and several aggressive repair procedures may be needed, including a combination of endonasal and transcranial approaches.

2301,"Thymoquinone induces cell killing in glioblastoma cells through generation of DNA damage and cell cycle arrest Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common type of brain tumor in humans. Surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy is the current standard treatment; however, due to the upregulation of several survival pathways, tumor recurrence is quite common with a median survival of 12 to 15 months. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of glioblastoma. Naturally occurring phytochemicals have steadily received much scientific attention, owing to the fact that many of these compounds have potent action against tumors. Thymoquinone (TQ) is the bioactive compound of the volatile oil extracted from the black seed, Nigella sativa. TQ has shown anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic actions with a selective cytotoxicity for human cancer cells compared to several normal cells. Here, we show that TQ is able to dose-dependently inhibit colony formation in three distinct glioblastoma cell lines (T98, U87 and Gli36), with the highly tumorigenic Gli36 being the most sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of TQ. We also show that TQ induces persistent -H2AX activation, a marker of DNA double strand breaks, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TQ also causes G2/M cell cycle arrest in GBM cells to a degree that correlates with the cells' relative clonogenic sensitivity. Moreover, co-treatment with TQ and N-acetyl cysteine, a simple thiol nucleophile and antioxidant, prevented cell death, DNA double strand breaks, and cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that TQ is a potent inhibitor of GBM cell proliferation and growth, and that this effect may be mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species.",Excluded

Confidence in medical evaluations with increasing levels of laboratory testing and imaging was rated on a 100-point visual analog scale. Knowledge of radiation exposure was ascertained when participants compared the radiation dose of one abdomen-pelvis CT with 2-view chest radiography. To assess cancer risk knowledge, participants rated their agreement with these factual statements: ""Approximately 2 to 3 abdominal CTs give the same radiation exposure as experienced by Hiroshima survivors"" and ""2 to 3 abdominal CTs over a person's lifetime can increase cancer risk."" Previous CT was also assessed.RESULTS: There were 1,168 participants, 67% women and mean age 40.7 years (SD 15.9 years). Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor. Median agreement with the Hiroshima statement was 13 (95% CI 10 to 16) and 45 (95% CI 40 to 45) with the increased lifetime cancer risk statement. Seven hundred ninety-five patients reported receiving a previous CT. Of 365 patients who reported no previous CT, 142 (39%) had one documented in our electronic medical record.CONCLUSION: Patients are more confident when CT imaging is part of their medical evaluation but have a poor understanding of the concomitant radiation exposure and risk and underestimate their previous imaging experience.",Excluded
1887,"Significance of histology in determining management of lesions regrowing after radiosurgery Brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery may show delayed enlargement on post-treatment imaging that is of ambiguous etiology. Histopathologic interpretation of brain specimens is often challenging due to the presence of significant radiation effects admixed with irradiated residual tumor of indeterminate viability. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of histologic findings on clinical outcomes following resection of these lesions. Between 2004 and 2010, 690 patients with brain metastases were enrolled in a prospective gamma knife data repository, and lesions requiring excision were identified. Tissue specimens were divided into four groups based on the ratio of treatment related inflammatory changes (TRIC) to tumor cells, and subsequently patient outcomes were assessed. Of 2,583 metastases treated, 36 were excised due to symptomatic enlargement. Only TRIC, without residual evidence of tumor, was seen in 36 % (13/36) of specimens. Resection of these lesions resulted in 100 % local control in follow-up. Of the remaining 23 lesions that contained any viable-appearing tumor within the resected specimen, 8 recurred after resection. Lesions that enlarged in the first 6 months were more likely to contain higher amounts of residual tumor cells. Patients with even <2 % tumors cells on excision had significantly worse local control (75 vs. 100 %, p = 0.024) and survival (HR 0.27, p = 0.029) compared with those patients with exclusively TRIC.

Total combination of the changes in ultrastructure of the blood capillaries and perivascular astrocytes makes it possible to suppose that permeability of the microvascular bed wall is increased. At this period, together with the destructive changes there are evidently certain compensatory-restorative processes, developing in the cerebral tissue.

The neurocognitive assessment covered mem ory, attention, language, executive and visiospatial functions. In young adults after prenatal exposure a relation ship was analyzed between a cognitive function and radiation dose to foetus, brain and thyroid gland. Internal con trols were used for both groups - the group of Chornobyl cleanup workers exposed in doses less than 20 mSv and an age matched comparison group from radioactively contaminated areas for subjects exposed in utero.RESULTS: Cognitive functions in cleanup workers exposed to ionizing radiation at adulthood are characterized by symptoms of a mild cognitive impairment according to the MMSE (mean group score 25,58 +/- 2,95) and a significant ly higher level of mental disorders according to the BPRS in a dose related manner. Cleanup workers exposed to doses over 500 mSv demonstrate a significant cognitive deficit in comparison with those exposed below 500 mSv and espe cially non exposed patients. Subjects exposed in utero during the check at age of 25-27 years exhibit an excess of the disorders of autonomic nervous system (ICD 10: G90).

Relationship were revealed between the TERT, TERF1, TERF2 genes expression, relative telomere length (RTL),cognitive deficit and cerebrovascular pathology, radiation dose and age. Telomere length in cleanup workers is sreduced after 50 years (6.1 %). The most significant reduction in telomere length is shown after 70 years (11.7 %). Negative correlation was found between telomere length and degree of cog nitive deficit (MMSE scale) and between age and degree of cognitive deficit. The RTL is significantly decreased in groups of persons with cognitive deficit compared to a comparison group. Telomere length at the late period after low dose radiation exposure is downregulated by the high TERF2 gene expression combined with low expression of TERT gene. After exposure to doses over 250-500 mSv a cognitive deficit and dementia were associated with a substantial increase in TERT gene expression, overexpression of TERF1 and decrease in expression of TERF2 gene.

Twenty-four patients received whole brain irradiation (Group I), 22 for ""elective"" and two for therapeutic purposes, while 14 did not (Group II). Abnormalities in computed tomographic (CT) scans of the brain were more frequently observed in Group I than in Group II (70% vs. 0%, p less than 0.01). Clinical central nervous system neurotoxicity developed in three patients in Group I, while none developed in patients in Group II (p less than 0.05). Patients who received methotrexate and procarbazine after whole brain irradiation were at a higher risk for clinical central nervous system neurotoxicity (p less than 0.05), and for development of periventricular white matter changes in CT brain scans (p less than 0.05) than were patients in Group II.

2931,"Diffusion measured white matter disintegration in cluster headache Objectives: In our former study we showed altered microstructure of the white matter in migraineurs. It is not known yet if these changes of MRI diffusion parameters were specific for migraine, or related to the repeated pain attacks. Method(s): 11 patients with cluster headache and 11 agematched healthy control subjects were recruited. Diffusion weighted MRI images with 60 diffusion directions were acquired on a 1.5 T GE Signa Excite scanner. Tract based spatial statistics were used to detect the integrity of white matter tracts in a skeleton representing the core of the fibre bundles. Result(s): Reduced fractional anisotropy was found in a right corticospinal tract, in the corpus callosum and in the anterior thalamic radiation bilaterally. The axial diffusivity was bilaterally increased in the anterior thalamic radiation, in the anterior corona radiate and in the inferior part of the fronto-occipital fasciculus. The mean and perpendicular diffusivity was increased almost over the whole brain with left sided dominance. Discussion(s): Since the above described white matter microstructural alterations, however more extensive, are similar to those found in migraine, this points to the assumption that these findings might reflect pain related alterations that are not specific to either of the diseases.",Excluded
399,"Impairment of cerebral blood flow regulation in astronauts with orthostatic intolerance after flight BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated cerebral blood flow regulation in astronauts before and after flights. We hypothesized that autoregulation would be different before flight and after flight between nonfinishers and the finishers of a stand test.METHODS: Twenty-seven astronauts from shuttle missions lasting 8 to 16 days underwent a 10-minute stand test: 10 days before flight, 1 to 2 hours and 3 days after landing. Mean blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was measured using transcranial Doppler; Mean arterial pressure was measured using a Finapres (Ohmeda, Englewood, CO) and was adjusted to the level of the MCA (BP(MCA)). Cross-spectral power, gain, phase, and coherence were determined for the relation between BP(MCA) and the cerebrovascular resistance index mean blood flow velocity/BP(MCA).RESULTS: BP(MCA) was reduced with stand (P<0.001). Differences between finishers and nonfinishers (P=0.011) and over test days (P=0.004) were observed. Cerebrovascular conductance was affected by stand (P<0.001), by group (P<0.001) with a group by stand, and test day interaction (P<0.01). Preflight data suggest that the nonfinishers were operating at a higher cerebral vasodilation than finishers for a given BP(MCA), and on landing day the nonfinishers had a greater decrease in mean blood flow velocity as a function of BP(MCA) with standing compared to finishers and preflight. There was a significant interaction effect of gender over the test days and from supine to stand (P=0.035).CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the cause of presyncope in astronauts may be related to a mismatch of cerebral blood flow with blood pressure. Astronaut gender may also play a role in susceptibility to orthostatic intolerance after flight.",Excluded

3033,"Orientation-specific fast rTMS maximizes corticospinal inhibition and facilitation Specific stimulation of neuronal circuits may promote selective inhibition or facilitation of corticospinal tract excitability. Monophasic stimulation is more likely to achieve direction-specific neuronal excitation. In 10 healthy subjects, we compared four types of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), monophasic and biphasic stimuli with the initial current in the brain flowing antero-posteriorly (""posteriorly directed"") or postero-anteriorly (""anteriorly directed""). We applied rTMS over the primary motor cortex contralateral to the dominant hand, using 80 stimuli at 5 Hz frequency at an intensity yielding baseline motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes of 1 mV. Monophasic stimulation was always more efficient than biphasic. Facilitation was induced by intracerebral anteriorly directed current flow and inhibition by posteriorly oriented current flow, although only initially for approximately 30 pulses. The early inhibition was absent when studied during a tonic muscle contraction. Several mechanisms could account for these findings. They include a more efficient excitation of inhibiting circuits by posteriorly oriented pulses, and a back-propagating D-wave inhibiting early I-waves and thus inducing early inhibition of MEP amplitude. In any case biphasic rTMS results can be explained by a mixture of monophasic opposite stimulations. We propose the use of monophasic pulses for maximizing effects during rTMS.",Excluded

We applied single dose of 3 Gy 2-3 times weekly and a maximum dose of 24-30 Gy. Follow-up was 2 years and included documentation of subjective discomforts (induration, deviation and painful erection).RESULTS: Induration (27.6%) and deviation (24.1%) of the erected penis are little improved, but in two-third of patients (65%) with painful erection defined relief could be obtained. It could also be shown that patients with short history of symptoms had best chances for a successful treatment. Side effects were not seen.CONCLUSION: In our experience radiotherapy is not suitable for all stages of IPP. Only patients in the early stages of IPP-especially the ones who suffer from painful erection-should be considered suitable for treatment with ionising radiation.",Excluded
1008,"Pomegranate supplementation improves affective and motor behavior in mice after radiation exposure Currently, NASA has plans for extended space travel, and previous research indicates that space radiation can have negative effects on cognitive skills as well as physical and mental health. With long-term space travel, astronauts will be exposed to greater radiation levels. Research shows that an antioxidant-enriched diet may offer some protection against the cellular effects of radiation and may provide significant neuroprotection from the effects of radiation-induced cognitive and behavioral skill deficits. Ninety-six C57BL/6 mice (48 pomegranate fed and 48 control) were irradiated with proton radiation (2 Gy), and two-month postradiation behaviors were assessed using a battery of behavioral tests to measure cognitive and motor functions. Proton irradiation was associated with depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test, but this effect was ameliorated by the pomegranate diet. Males, in general, displayed worse coordination and balance than females on the rotarod task, and the pomegranate diet ameliorated this effect. Overall, it appears that proton irradiation, which may be encountered in space, may induce a different pattern of behavioral deficits in males than females and that a pomegranate diet may confer protection against some of those effects.",Included

None of the animals presented a neurological deficit, and the EEG recording was without significant changes. Histological damage which could be attributed to the radiation was not observed. Serum proteins, however, were detected immunohistochemically in reactive astrocytes (3 x), in macrophages (2 x) and as diffuse perivascular accumulation. Brain water in the white matter near the implantation site increased from 68.6 to 73.2%, corresponding to a volume increase of about 17%. There was no change in the grey matter or the opposite hemisphere. Cerebral blood flow decreased slightly but there was no relationship with the development of edema.

However, the biological effects due to exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) produced by mobile phones are largely unknown. Environmental and occupational exposure of humans to gamma-rays is a biologically relevant phenomenon. Consequently studies were undertaken to examine the interactions between gamma-rays and EMF on human health. In this study, exposure to 900-MHz EMF expanded gamma-ray damage to SHG44 cells. Preexposure EMF enhanced the decrease in cell proliferation induced by gamma-ray irradiation and the rate of apoptosis. The combination of EMF and gamma-ray exposure resulted in a synergistic effect by triggering stress response, which increased reactive oxygen species, but the expression of hsp70 at both mRNA and protein levels remained unaltered. Data indicate that the adverse effects of gamma-rays on cellular functions are strengthened by EMF.",Excluded

The Japanese quail is an excellent model for studying the mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement because of its distinct and marked response to changing photoperiods. Studies on this animal have suggested that the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) is an important centre controlling photoperiodic time measurement. Here we report that expression in the MBH of the gene encoding type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2), which catalyses the intracellular deiodination of thyroxine (T4) prohormone to the active 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), is induced by light in Japanese quail. Intracerebroventricular administration of T3 mimics the photoperiodic response, whereas the Dio2 inhibitor iopanoic acid prevents gonadal growth. These findings demonstrate that light-induced Dio2 expression in the MBH may be involved in the photoperiodic response of gonads in Japanese quail.",Excluded

3551,"Radiation-induced DNA damage in tumors and normal tissues. II. Influence of dose, residual DNA damage and physiological factors in oxygenated cells Detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors is important for many experimental and clinical situations. Several laboratories, including ours, have suggested that assays which measure radiation-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) might be used to detect or quantify hypoxic cells in tumors and normal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of using an alkaline elution assay that measures strand breaks and DPCs to detect and/or quantify hypoxic cells in tissues. For this approach to be valid, DPCs must not be formed to any great extent in irradiated oxygenated cells, and the formation and repair of strand breaks and DPCs in oxygenated cells must not be modified appreciably by physiological factors (e.g. temperature, pH and nutrient depletion) that are often found in solid tumors. To address these issues, two sets of experiments were performed. In one set of experiments, oxygenated 9L cells in tissue culture, subcutaneous 9L tumors and rat cerebella were irradiated with doses of 15 or 50 Gy and allowed to repair until the residual strand break damage was low enough to detect DPCs. In another set of experiments, oxygenated exponentially growing or plateau-phase 9L cells in tissue culture were irradiated with a dose of 15 Gy at 37 or 20 degrees C, while the cells were maintained at a pH of either 6.6 or 7.3. DNA-protein crosslinks were formed in oxygenated cells about 100 times less efficiently than in hypoxic cells. In addition, temperature, pH, nutrient depletion and growth phase did not appreciably alter the formation and repair of strand breaks or the formation of DPCs in oxygenated 9L cells. These results support the use of this DNA damage assay for the detection and quantification of hypoxic cells in solid tumors.",Included

1845,"Brain MRI characteristics and scoring in adult onset krabbe disease Introduction: Krabbe disease is a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease due to decreased galactocerebrosidase activity. Adult onset is rare, however probably underdiagnosed. Brain MRI showing a leukodystrophy is of great value to achieve diagnosis. We aimed at performing for the first time a systematic analysis of brainMRI features in adult onset Krabbe disease (>10 years old). Method(s): We collected the first available brain MRI of patients seen in the reference center for lysosomal diseases. We also contacted authors of published articles describing adult onset Krabbe disease patients and ask them to share brain MRI data. A score was established to describe the brain MRIs, with quantification according to severity (from 0 to 4 for nonfascicular structures and from 0 to 2 for fascicular structures). Two neuroradiologists first scored separately the MRIs, then reached a consensus for final scoring. Result(s): Thirteen patients were included in the study. Pyramidal tract was the most frequent structure showing abnormal T2 hypersignal (100% of patients), however with some distinctions along the tractus: medial precentral gyrus (100% of patients, mean score 2.8/4), lateral precentral gyrus (77%, 1.77/4), and corona radiata (100%, 1.7/2) were highly abnormal whereas internal capsula (69%, 0.96/2), mesencephalon (46%, 0.69/2), pons (31%, 0.42/2), and spinal bulb (0%, 0/2) were quite spared. Other sus tentorial white matter (WM) localizations were also found abnormal: occipital WM (92%, 2.15/ 4), optic radiations (69%, mean score 1.03/2), frontalWM(69%, 1.5/4), temporal WM (61%, 1.15/4), and parietal WM (15%, 0.23/4). 9/13 patients (69%) had corpus callosum hypersignal especially in isthmus (69%, mean score 1.38/2), body (38%, 0.77/2), and splenium (31%, 0.61/2), whereas genu was always normal. Finally, medial lemniscus was the most frequent abnormal structure found in posterior fossa (9/13 patients, 69%, mean score 0.96/2).

Aim 1 - To provide 3 year results for the longitudinal study. Aim 2 - To improve the questionnaire used to collect data by identifying redundant items and modifying for use to collect Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) data.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Aim 1 - Patient reported outcome data were collected prospectively by 226 patients before and up to 3 years following radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer using a questionnaire developed to collect LENT subjective data. Aim 2 - A factor analysis was performed to identify which questions gave the most and least information.RESULTS: Aim 1 - Faecal urgency and incontinence (all grades) peaked at 79% and 24%, respectively at 1 year then settled to 69% and 18% at 3 years, respectively. Urinary urgency (all grades) increased with time and was described in 75% at 3 years. Other symptoms reported at 3 years include diarrhoea in 12%, urinary incontinence in 27% and vaginal dryness in 29%. A third of patients did not feel their sex life had changed following treatment, while a quarter felt that it had. Aim 2 - some questions overlapped and others were non-specific.

Hydrophone transducers were implanted in the models to record the microwave-induced mechanical vibrations. Four properly timed radar pulses produced a threefold increase in the acoustical amplitudes in the muscle model. In the spherical model, a pulse train of three properly timed microwave pulses doubled the stress wave amplitudes as recorded by the implanted hydrophone.

972,"The frequency of adverse events by radiation therapy for atomic bomb survivors with cancer Purpose/Objective(s): In Japan, there are many survivors who received ionizing radiation by atomic bomb in 1945. Currently, atomic bomb survivors (ABS) who suffered from cancer are treated as same as usual cancer patients. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse events (AE) of radiation therapy (RT) are increased or not in ABS. To clarify the safety of RT for ABS, we evaluated the frequency of AE by RT in ABS. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients who received curative RT for cancer between 2005 and 2010. We selected the ABS who were officially certified by the Japanese government. AE were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score Ver.3. One hundred and sixty-five ABS were recruited in this study. Median age was 74 years old (59 to 93) and 96 (58.2%) were men. Median age at the time receiving ionizing radiation by atomic bomb was 11 years old (0 to 32). One hundred and thirty-six ABS (82.4%) were pre-treatment performance status (PS) 0, 21 (12.7%) was PS 1, and 8 (4.8%) were PS 2 or over. Thirty-seven were diagnosed with head and neck, 32 with genitourinary, 29 with breast, 27 with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic, 23 with lung and mediastinum, and 17 with other cancer. Result(s): One hundred four ABS were definitive irradiation, 48 were postoperative irradiation, and 13 were pre-operative irradiation. Concurrent chemotherapy was performed on 51. Median dose of external RTwas 50 Gy (30 to 78) based on their cancer type. Fifteen patients were performed on stereotactic RT, 12 on intensity-modulated RT, and 11 on brachytherapy. All patients were received standard dose irradiation and completed planned RT. No patients received extended RTover 1 week. Median observation time was 40 months (1 to 84). One hundred fifty-six patients (94.5%) were alive and 9 (5.5%) were dead when at the time investigated. There were no patients who died of AE in the entire course. In acute AE, sixteen patients (9.7%) were classified into grade 3 or above, i.e. one with esophageal mucositis and 15 with hematotoxicity (Grade 3: 11, Grade 4: 4). All these patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Grade 4 or 5 non-hematotoxicitic AE was not identified. In late AE, twelve patients (7.3%) were classified into Grade 3 or above. Four patients were classified into Grade 4, i.e. 3 with myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 with cerebral infarction.

A 0.3-kb cDNA that was consistently observed in irradiated cultures but not in unirradiated cultures was cloned and sequenced. It was found to be identical to Ptk-3, a receptor tyrosine kinase gene identified recently. The protein encoded by Ptk-3 is a member of a novel class of receptor tyrosine kinases whose extracellular domain contains regions of homology with coagulation factors V and VIII and complement component C1. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of Ptk-3 was increased in rat astrocytes by 0.5 h after exposure to 10 Gy and remained at the same elevated level for at least 24 h. The maximum increase occurred after 5 Gy. Cloning studies indicated the presence of at least two Ptk-3 mRNA transcripts, which are probably the result of an alternative splicing mechanism. The short isoform lacks a 37-amino acid sequence in the glycine/proline-rich juxtamembrane region. The splicing pattern of the Ptk-3 gene was not altered by radiation. However, the ratios of the longer to the shorter mRNA transcripts differed between adult cortex, neonatal cortex and in vitro astrocyte cultures.",Included
654,"Gut flora-targeted photobiomodulation therapy improves senile dementia in an As-induced Alzheimer's disease animal model BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy is believed to have a positive regulatory effect on the imbalance of certain body functions, including inflammation, immunity, wound healing, nerve repair, and pain. Previous studies have found that the intestinal flora of patients with AD is in an unbalanced state. Therefore, we have proposed the use of gut flora-targeted PBM (gf-targeted PBM) as a method to improve AD in an As-induced AD mouse model.METHODS: PBM was performed on the abdomen of the mice at the wavelengths of 630 nm, 730 nm, and 850 nm at 100 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for 8 weeks. Morris water maze test, immunofluorescence and proteomic of hippocampus, and intestinal flora detection of fecal were used to evaluate the treatment effects of gf-targeted PBM on AD rats.RESULTS: PBM at all three wavelengths (especially 630 nm and 730 nm) significantly improved learning retention as measured by the Morris water maze. In addition, we found reduced amyloidosis and tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus by immunofluorescence in AD mice. By using a quantitative proteomic analysis of the hippocampus, we found that gf-targeted PBM significantly altered the expression levels of 509 proteins (the same differentially expressed proteins in all three wavelengths of PBM), which involved the pathways of hormone synthesis, phagocytosis, and metabolism. The 16 s rRNA gene sequencing of fecal contents showed that PBM significantly altered the diversity and abundance of intestinal flora. Specifically, PBM treatment reversed the typical increase of Helicobacter and uncultured Bacteroidales and the decrease of Rikenella seen in AD mice.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that gf-targeted PBM regulates the diversity of intestinal flora, which may improve damage caused by AD. Gf-targeted PBM has the potential to be a noninvasive microflora regulation method for AD patients.",Excluded

Ongoing protocols testing the efficacy of thoracic irradiation should be able to settle question of the optimal treatment approach in limited-stage SCLC over the next 1 to 2 years. Careful attention to volume treated and the use of shrinking fields produce the best results with the minimum of toxicity. Treatment of extensive-stage SCLC has not been substantially improved to date with the addition of local systemic irradiation. Prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the incidence of CNS failure in SCLC and should be given, at a minimum, to patients achieving complete response status. Whether patients with partial response should also receive prophylactic cranial irradiation remains controversial.

All 14 treatments were planned with GammaPlan for Gamma Knife, Eclipse for single isocenter volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), TomoTherapy Treatment Planning System (TPS) for TomoTherapy, and MultiPlan for CyberKnife. Initial planning was performed with the goal of planning target volume coverage of V100 >=95% without hippocampal avoidance. If the maximum hippocampal point dose (Dmax) was <6.6 Gy in a single fraction and <40% of the hippocampi received <=4.5 Gy, no second plan was performed. If either constraint was not met, replanning was performed with these constraints.RESULTS: There was a median of 6 metastases per plan, with an average total tumor volume of 7.32 mL per plan. The median hippocampal Dmax (in Gy) without sparing averaged 1.65, 9.81, 4.38, and 5.46, respectively (P < .0001). Of 14 plans, 3 Gamma Knife and CyberKnife plans required replanning, whereas 13 VMAT and 8 TomoTherapy plans required replanning. The hippocampal constraints were not achievable in 1 plan on any platform when the tumor was bordering the hippocampus. The mean volume of brain receiving 12 Gy (in mL), which has been associated with symptomatic radionecrosis, was 23.57 with Gamma Knife, 76.77 with VMAT, 40.86 with CyberKnife, and 104.06 with TomoTherapy (P = .01). The overall average conformity indices for all plans ranged from 0.36 to 0.52.CONCLUSIONS: Even with SRS, the hippocampi can receive a considerable dose; however, if the hippocampi are outlined as organs of risk, sparing these structures is feasible in nearly all situations with all 4 platforms, without detriment to target coverage, and should be considered in all patients undergoing SRS for multiple brain metastases.SUMMARY: Hippocampi play an important role in memory, and sparing of these structures in whole brain radiation can improve neurocognitive outcomes. The hippocampi are not routinely spared when using stereotactic radiosurgery. We evaluated the incidental dose to the hippocampi when treating multiple brain metastases and sought to examine if hippocampal sparing is feasible without detriment to target coverage.

We evaluated our experience with radiosurgical and microsurgical treatment alone and in combination for the management of NVCNS.METHODS: The charts of 62 patients with NVCNS who were treated between 1993 and 2005 at our institution were reviewed. Patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The patients underwent microsurgery and/or radiosurgery treatment.RESULTS: Trigeminal and jugular foramen schwannomas were the most common NVCNS tumors (n = 47), and the only two groups with sufficient numbers of patients to allow comparison of the three treatment approaches. In these two groups, the mean tumor volume was significantly higher in those who received combined therapy (8.59 +/- 2.29 cc), compared with radiosurgery (4.94 +/- 3.02 cc; p = 0.05) or microsurgery alone (5.38 +/- 3.23; p = 0.027). Patients who underwent radiosurgery alone were significantly older (67.7 +/- 13.3 years; p = 0.019) than those treated with microsurgery (55.3 +/- 13.7 years) or with both modalities (48.7 +/- 12.8 years). The Karnofsky Performance Scale scores were significantly higher (p < or = 0.05) at follow-up compared with baseline for all three treatment approaches. There was no significant change in the Glasgow Outcome scores before and after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgery and radiosurgery can both be used to manage NVCNS tumors with excellent results. When treatment with either modality alone is not reasonable, tumors can be managed effectively with combined micro- and radiosurgery treatment.",Included

Radiation induced deficits in learning and memory were also significantly (p < 0.001) ameliorated.CONCLUSION: The result of present study showed that prior/post-supplementation of G. asiatica has radioprotective potential as well as neuroprotective properties against the radiation.",Included
684,"Low dose fractionated radiotherapy and temozolomiDe in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: Preliminary results of a pilot study Purpose: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the brain tumor with the worst prognosis, especially for patients with gross residual tumor after surgery (RPA classes V and VI). In vitro studies demonstrated the hyper-radiosensitivity of human malignant glioma cell lines to low radiation doses, moreover preclinical studies hypothesized a synergism between low doses fractionated radiotherapy (LD-FRT) and chemotherapy. Therefore we planned a pilot study to define the feasibility and the efficacy of this approach in na GBM RPA classes V-VI. Materials: Patients enrolled in the study had the following characteristics: histological diagnosis of GBM, based on minimal surgical resection or biopsy; age 18-80 years; RPA classes V-VI; estimated survival 3 months; normal haematological, renal, hepatic, cardiac and respiratory functions. Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was defined as the surgical bed with gross residual contrast-enhancing tissue on magnetic resonance imaging. The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) was defined as the GTV with a 30 mm margin to incluDe any potential subclinical tumor. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) was defined as CTV + 5 mm, due to set-up uncertainties. Hypofractionated 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) was delivered on GTV (total dose: 30 Gy in fractions of 3 Gy/day) with concomitant and adjuvant (1 cycle) temozolomiDe (TMZ). From second to fifth cycle of adjuvant TMZ (200 mg/m2), if neither progression disease was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, nor unacceptable toxicities were recorded, LD-FRT was associated (2 daily fractions of 0.40 Gy, over 5 days, q 28). Primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of toxicity and safety of this schedula (RTOG criteria). Clinical response (RECIST criteria), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also evaluated. Result(s): From June 2008 to October 2010 15 patients with a newly diagnosis of GBM were enrolled in this study. Eight patients underwent incomplete surgical resection and 7 patients received only biopsy. The median total dose of LD-FRT delivered was 1040 cGy (range 320 1920). Up to this date 11 patients are evaluable. GraDe 12 haematological toxicity was observed in 18 % of patients, graDe 34 was observed in 9 % of patients, mainly represented by leukopenia and thrombocytopenia; however no neurological acute and late toxicity were observed. No treatment related death occurred. Four patients (36%) had a partial response (PR), while 2 patients (18%) had a stable disease (SD), lasting more than 8 weeks (Clinical Benefit 54%). At a median follow-up of 9 months (range 2 22) median PFS was 5 months and median OS was 9 months, with a survival rate at 1 year of 30%. Conclusion(s): The results of the study demonstrated that LD-FRT with concurrent chemotherapy, after hypofractionated 3D-CRT plus Temozolomide, is a well tolerated treatment with a low toxicity profile. This data seem to be encouraging and suggest the prosecution of the analysis.",Excluded
2529,"Potassium currents in isolated statocyst neurons and RPeD1 in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis To begin to determine the underlying neural mechanisms of memory formation, we studied two different cell types that play important roles in different forms of associative learning in Lymnaea. Statocyst neurons (hair cells) mediate classical conditioning, whereas RPeD1 is a site of memory formation induced by operant conditioning of aerial respiration. Because potassium (K(+)) channels play a critical role in neuronal excitability, we initiated studies on these channels in the aforementioned neurons. Three distinct K(+) currents are expressed in the soma of both the hair cells and RPeD1. In hair cells and RPeD1, there is a fast activating and rapidly inactivating 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive A current (I(A)), a tetraethyl ammonium (TEA)-sensitive delayed rectifying current, which exhibits slow inactivation kinetics (I(KV)), and a TEA- and 4-AP-insensitive Ca(2+)-dependent current (I(Ca-K)). In hair cells, the activation voltage of I(A); its half-maximal steady-state activation voltage and its half-maximal steady-state inactivation were at more depolarized levels than in RPeD1. The time constant of recovery from I(A) inactivation was slightly faster in hair cells. I(A) in hair cells is also smaller in amplitude than in RPeD1 and is activated at more depolarized potentials. In like manner, I(KV) is smaller in hair cells and is activated at more depolarized potentials than in RPeD1.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To describe the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes in patients with small cell bladder cancer at our institution, including those who received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for the prevention of intracranial recurrence.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with small cell bladder cancer treated at a single institution between January 1990 and August 2015 were identified and analyzed retrospectively for demographics, tumor stage, treatment, and overall survival.RESULTS: Of 44 patients diagnosed with small cell bladder cancer, 11 (25%) had metastatic disease at the time of presentation. Treatment included systemic chemotherapy (70%), radical surgery (59%), and local radiation (39%). Six patients (14%) received PCI. Median overall survival was 10 months (IQR 4 - 41). Patients with extensive disease had worse overall survival than those with organ confined disease (8 months vs. 36 months, respectively, p = 0.04). Among those who received PCI, 33% achieved 5 - year survival.CONCLUSION: Outcomes for patients with small cell bladder cancer remain poor.

Optical coherence tomography disclosed an abnormally level of high reflectivity in red to orange colours throughout the entire neuroretina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid. The RPE-choriocapillaris complex was thickened and hyper-reflective, corresponding with dense crystalline deposits.CONCLUSION: The observed uncommon hyper-reflectivity in BCD relates to the deposition of numerous infiltrates. In vivo investigations by OCT confirmed histological studies that a crystalline retinopathy corresponds with numerous infiltrates in the retina, RPE and choroid. The RPE and choroid have intensive hyper-reflection and may be the primary location of the disease.",Excluded
3043,"A mouse model replicating hippocampal sparing cranial irradiation in humans: A tool for identifying new strategies to limit neurocognitive decline Cancer patients undergoing cranial irradiation are at risk of developing neurocognitive impairments. Recent evidence suggests that radiation-induced injury to the hippocampi could play an important role in this cognitive decline. As a tool for studying the mechanisms of hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline, we developed a mouse model replicating the results of the recent clinical RTOG 0933 study of hippocampal sparing whole-brain irradiation. We irradiated 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice to a single dose of 10 Gy using either whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) or hippocampal sparing irradiation (HSI). These animals, as well as sham-irradiated controls, were subjected to behavioral/cognitive assessments distinguishing between hippocampal-dependent and hippocampal-independent functions. Irradiation was well tolerated by all animals and only limited cell death of proliferating cells was found within the generative zones. Animals exposed to WBRT showed significant deficits compared to sham-irradiated controls in the hippocampal-dependent behavioral task. In contrast, HSI mice did not perform significantly different from sham-irradiated mice (control group) and performed significantly better when compared to WBRT mice. This is consistent with the results from the RTOG 0933 clinical trial, and as such this animal model could prove a helpful tool for exploring new strategies for mitigating cognitive decline in cancer patients receiving cranial irradiation.",Included
3012,"Procoagulant and inflammatory mediators in small cell lung carcinoma: Potential role in thromboembolic complications Background: Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) patients exhibit a higher prevalence of thromboembolic complications. We hypothesized that in this malignancy, procoagulant and inflammatory mediators contribute to the pathogenesis of such complications and warfarin may down regulate these levels. Method(s): In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, patients with inoperable lung cancer (n=100) were randomized to receive chemotherapy and radiation with and without warfarin (INR 1.5 - 2.5). Blood samples were drawn prior to and after the 2nd treatment cycle with warfarin or control and retrospectively analyzed for microparticles and thrombin generation markers such as fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment F1.2 (F1.2). In addition, biochip array for C-reactive protein (CRP), D Dimer, neuron specific enolase (NSE), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and thrombomodulin (TM) were measured. The results were compared with a normal population (N=50). Result(s): The microparticles were markedly increased in the SCLC patients (3 fold increase) at baseline. Similary, the thrombin generation markers showed variable increase (1.5-3.2 fold increase). In the biochip array analysis, variable increase was noted. CRP (2.4 fold), D DIMER (11.6 fold), NSE (1.8 fold), NGAL (1.7 fold), TNFR1 (2 fold) and TM (1.3 fold) were all increased as compared to normal controls. All of the markers exhibited a decrease after warfarin treatment with a most pronounced decrease in the D Dimer and TNFR1. Conclusion(s): These results validate the hypothesis that SCLC patients exhibit a hypercoagulable state that is associated with simultaneous upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Warfarin treatment results in a down regulation of these mediators. Our results provide a rationale for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in this group of patients.",Excluded

3342,"Pituitary metastasis from renal cell carcinoma: Description of a case report Objective: Rare disease Background: Pituitary metastasis is uncommon, breast and lung cancers being the most frequent primary tumors. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare cause of pituitary metastases, with only a few cases described to date. Case Report: We report a case of a 61-year-old man who presented with a progressive deterioration of visual acuity and field associated with a bitemporal hemianopsia. Two years ago, he underwent radical right nephrectomy for a clear cell RCC (ccRCC). The biological tests showed pan-hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. Brain MRI revealed a large sellar tumor lesion bilaterally infiltrating the cavernous sinuses, which was surgically resected. Histology confirmed a ccRCC pituitary metastasis. The patient received post-surgical radiotherapy. Considering the presence of concomitant extra-pituitary metastases, treatment with sunitinib was started, followed by several lines of therapy with axitinib, everolimus, and sorafenib because of tumor progression. The patient also presented with a pituitary tumor recurrence, which was treated by stereotaxic radiotherapy. He died five years after the initial diagnosis of RCC and 30 months after the diagnosis of the pituitary metastasis. Conclusion(s): There are no standardized treatment guidelines for management of pituitary metastases. Pituitary surgery plays a role in symptom palliation, and it does not have any relevant impact on survival. Exclusive radiotherapy or stereotaxic radiotherapy could be an alternative to surgery in patients whose general condition is poor or who have concomitant extra-pituitary metastases.

Levels of pineal gland melatonin were measured twice daily--10:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.--10 days after initial light treatment. Thirty additional guinea pigs were also assigned to these groups and treated similarly. For these latter animals, refractive status, ocular length, and vitreous depth were measured before and after light treatment. Eight weeks after light treatment, retinal and sceral levels of melanopsin, melatonin receptor type (MT) 1, and mRNA protein were determined by Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: The level of pineal gland melatonin in the green-light group was significantly higher than that in the blue-light group. Biometric measurements showed that guinea pigs in the green-light group had a somewhat myopic refractive status. Expressions of retinal melanopsin mRNA and protein were significantly higher in the blue-light group and lower in the green-light group when compared to controls. Conversely, expressions of MT1 receptor mRNA and protein in retina and sclera were significantly higher in the green-light group and lower in the blue-light group when compared to controls.CONCLUSIONS: Green light appears to suppress induction of melatonin production. In addition, 530 nm of green light is involved in the development of myopia. In the guinea pig, MT1 receptor and melanopsin appear to play roles in the development of myopia induced by 530 nm of light.",Excluded

Purpose(s): To assess the effect of gadodiamide and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) on T<inf>1</inf>-weighted images and on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of DN. Study Type: Single-center retrospective. Population: In all, 125 patients who underwent brain MRIs were classified into four groups: 1) patients who did neither receive intravenous GBCAs injections nor irradiation (controls); 2) patients having >=3 GBCAs-enhanced scans and no WBRT; 3) patients having WBRT and < 3 GBCAs-enhanced scans; and 4) patients having WBRT and >= 3 GBCAs-enhanced scans. Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5T magnet, echo-planar diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and unenhanced T<inf>1</inf>-weighted sequences. Assessment: The DN-to-pons SI ratio on unenhanced T<inf>1</inf>-weighted images and ADC values of the DN were calculated.

2544,"Initial evaluation of the feasibility of single photon emission tomography with p-[<sup>123</sup>I]iodo-L-phenylalanine for routine brain tumour imaging p-[<sup>123</sup>I]iodo-L-phenylalanine (IPA) is a recently described radiopharmaceutical which is highly accumulated in gliomas. The present investigation was designed to evaluate the feasibility of single photon emission tomography (SPET) with IPA to image brain tumours under routine clinical conditions. Using a dual- and a triple-headed SPET camera, whole-body kinetic and brain SPET, as well as plasma, urinary and dosimetric analysis were determined in four patients with gliomas after intravenous injection of IPA. Results obtained by IPA SPET were retrospectively compared with histopathology, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Tumour lesions were clearly demonstrated by IPA SPET at 30 min, 1 h and 4.5 h post-injection, even in patients with low grade gliomas. In patients with glioblastoma, excellent visualization of the tumour was possible even at 7 h p.i., indicative of the high retention of the radiopharmaceutical in cerebral gliomas. Analysis of the radioactivity in plasma and urine attested to the high in vivo stability of IPA. Blood clearance was rapid (> 65% after 10 min) and IPA was excreted predominantly by the kidneys, the urinary radioactivity excretion ranging from 27% at 1 h to 54% of injected doses at 5 h p.i. The average effective dose for adults was estimated to be 0.0152 mSv.MBq<sup>-1</sup>, leading to an effective dose of 3.8 mSv in a typical brain SPET investigation with 250 MBq IPA. This result strongly suggests that IPA is a potentially valuable brain tumour imaging agent for widespread clinical studies with SPET. Its high specific tumour uptake and retention even in low grade gliomas represent a major advantage compared to presently available SPET radiopharmaceuticals. Moreover, the radiation dose estimates indicate that clinical use of IPA will result in acceptable radiation dose levels in humans. (© 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins).",Excluded
3092,"Mental disorders in radiation encephalopathy Chernobyl accident was major nuclear disaster in the history of mankind. Elimination of the consequences required large number of people. Most of them were exposed to the doses of radiation meeting criteria of so-called ""low doses"": 5 - 100 cGy. The impact of these doses on human health is not fully researched; mainly it refers to mental disorders. The purpose of our study was to investigate the clinical and pathological patterns of formation of mental disorders in liquidators exposed to ""low doses"" of radiation because of the Chernobyl accident. A group of 500 liquidators was examined in a continuous research during 1995-1999 and in 2000-2001. Clinical, clinicalpsychological and psychophysiological methods were mainly used; biochemical blood analysis and functional studies also were used. Change in clinical parameters and survey results were observed in the dynamics. Primary morbidity: a separate group of ""cerebrovascular disorders"" was highlighted. In 1989 it accounted for 14 % of primary morbidity, digestive diseases - 9%, and respiratory diseases - 45 %. In 1994, vascular disorders accounted for 43 %, respiratory diseases - 7% , and the digestive diseases - 25; In 1998 cerebral vascular disorders took first place in the primary morbidity, alongside with the increase of combined diverse classes ""neoplasm"", ""endocrine system disorders"" and ""blood diseases"". Disability: In 1990 cerebrovascular disorders occupied 37 % of all cases of disability, in 1993 - 84% of all disability. These disorders consisted of 90% cerebral disorders and had a tendency to deteriorate over time. We have shown that by the year 1998-1999 the psychoorganic syndrome was presented in 65% of liquidators, and in 83% of cases because of the cerebral vascular disorders. The following clinical forms were described: affective (80%), psychopathic (14.8%), and dementic (5.2%). Over time among the liquidators the number of diseases of various organs and systems are increasing. Among these diseases, cerebrovascular disease comes first; organic CNS lesion (radiation encephalopathy) results in clinically detectable psychoorganic syndrome in the major group of examined liquidators.

178,"Phase measurement of cognitive impairment specific to radiotherapy PURPOSE: Memory impairment is an early-delayed effect of radiotherapy (RT). The prospective longitudinal measurement of the cognitive phase effects from RT was conducted on treated and untreated brain tumor patients. The study design investigated semantic vs. perceptual and visual vs. verbal memory to determine the most disease-specific measure of RT-related changes and understanding of the neurotoxicity from RT to the brain.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tests of memory that had previously shown RT-related phasic changes were compared with experimental tests of memory to test hypotheses about cognition targeted to the neural toxicity of RT. The results from 41 irradiated and 29 nonirradiated patients with low-grade, supratentorial tumors were analyzed. The methods controlled for comorbid white matter risk, recurrence, interval after treatment, and age (18-69 years). The effects were examined before RT and at three points after RT to 1 year using a mixed effects model that included interval, group, surgical status, medication use, practice, and individual random effects. Four new tests of memory and other candidate cognitive tests were investigated, and a post hoc analysis of a comprehensive battery of tests was performed to identify the cognitive processes most specific to RT.RESULTS: The RT effects on memory were identified in the treated group only; among the new tests of memory and the complete neurocognitive battery, the RT effects were significant only for delayed recall (p < 0.009) and interval to recognize (p < 0.002). Tumor location was not related to the treatment effect. Memory decline was specific to retrieval of semantic memories; a double dissociation of semantic from perceptual visual memory was demonstrated in the RT group.CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate memory dependent on the semantic cortex and the hippocampal memory system. A cognitive measurement that is brief but specific to neural mechanisms is effective and feasible for studies of RT damage.",Included
420,"Dental implants in radiated areas: A series of 33 patients. [French] Introduction. Prosthetic rehabilitation, particularly in radiated areas, can be particularly difficult in patients with partial or total edentation following treatment for orofacial cancer. We report a series of patients who underwent a protocol of implantation in radiated bone with evaluation of the prosthetic rehabilitation. Material and method. Thirty-three patients given radiotherapy for an orofacial cancer were implanted, followed by a dental prosthesis. The three phases of the protocol were a preoperative clinical and radiological analysis, a surgical phase under general anaesthesia and a postoperative clinical and radiological follow-up. Results. Fifteen patients were treated for an oral cavity tumor, ten for a pharyngeal lesion, six for a laryngeal tumor and two for a maxillary cancer. The average dose of radiotherapy was 60.5 Gy. Sixty-eight implants were positioned, 91.9% in the anterior mandible. The delay between radiotherapy and implantation was 54 months. The delay between implantation and loading was seven months. The average follow-up was 31.9 months. No peri-implantitis was observed. Discussion. Implantation in irradiated bone is possible if a strict protocol is used; a good rate of success and improved quality of life will favour development of this technique. Criteria for dental implant placement include local and general conditions, the psychological situation and technical possibilities. Sufficient delay after radiotherapy is necessary to verify healing and the good prognosis of the cancer. The vascular supply can be preserved by implantation under general anesthesia.

Our experimental system enables us to address this question by allowing irradiated organisms to partner with unexposed individuals. Organs from both animals and appropriate sham and scatter dose controls are tested for expression of several endpoints such as calcium flux, role of 5HT, reporter assay cell death and proteomic profile. The results show that membrane related functions of calcium and 5HT are critical for true bystander effect expression. Our original inter-animal experiments used fish species whole body irradiated with low doses of X-rays, which prevented us from addressing the abscopal effect question. Data which are much more relevant in radiotherapy are now available for rats which received high dose local irradiation to the implanted right brain glioma. The data were generated using quasi-parallel microbeams at the biomedical beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble France. This means we can directly compare abscopal and ""true"" bystander effects in a rodent tumour model. Analysis of right brain hemisphere, left brain and urinary bladder in the directly irradiated animals and their unirradiated partners strongly suggests that bystander effects (in partner animals) are not the same as abscopal effects (in the irradiated animal). Furthermore, the presence of a tumour in the right brain alters the magnitude of both abscopal and bystander effects in the tissues from the directly irradiated animal and in the unirradiated partners which did not contain tumours, meaning the type of signal was different.",Included
909,"Long INterspersed element-1 mobility as a sensor of environmental stresses Long INterspersed element (LINE-1, L1) retrotransposons are the most abundant transposable elements in the human genome, constituting approximately 17%. They move by a ""copy-paste"" mechanism, involving reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate and insertion of its cDNA copy at a new site in the genome. L1 retrotransposition (L1-RTP) can cause insertional mutations, alter gene expression, transduce exons, and induce epigenetic dysregulation. L1-RTP is generally repressed; however, a number of observations collected over about 15 years revealed that it can occur in response to environmental stresses. Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that L1-RTP can play a role in the onset of several neurological and oncological diseases in humans. In recent years, great attention has been paid to the exposome paradigm, which proposes that health effects of an environmental factor should be evaluated considering both cumulative environmental exposures and the endogenous processes resulting from the biological response. L1-RTP could be an endogenous process considered for this application. Here, we summarize the current understanding of environmental factors that can affect the retrotransposition of human L1 elements. Evidence indicates that L1-RTP alteration is triggered by numerous and various environmental stressors, such as chemical agents (heavy metals, carcinogens, oxidants, and drugs), physical agents (ionizing and non-ionizing radiations), and experiential factors (voluntary exercise, social isolation, maternal care, and environmental light/dark cycles).

Exposure to a reduced gravity environment affects human anatomy and physiology. Countermeasures to restore homeostatic states within the human body have begun. The pathophysiological effects of exposure to microgravity, on the neurological system, are, however, still not clear. NASA has scheduled deep space exploration of extraterrestrial locations such as the Moon and Mars in the 2030s. Adverse health effects related to the human exposure to microgravity from previous, relatively shorter missions have been documented. A lengthy deep space travel to Mars could be overburdened by significant adverse health effects. Astronauts demonstrate a significant increase in the number of many types of circulating white blood cells (neutrophils, monocytes, T-helper cells, and B-cells) but a decrease in natural killer cells. It is unclear whether these changes are due to increased production or decreased clearance of these cells. In this review, viral reactivation in astronauts will be discussed, including the occurrence of clinical cases before, during, or after spaceflight and their management during and after flight. Studies on models used in spaceflight studies such as the AKATA cells (an immortalized B-cell line derived from a Japanese patient with Burkitt's lymphoma, a tumor induced by Epstein-Barr virus) and other cell lines which shed these latent viruses, will be reviewed with specific reference to gravitational changes, radiation, and spaceflight-induced immune suppression.",Excluded
1452,"Reliability of motor cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation in four muscle representations OBJECTIVE: Motor cortex plasticity may underlie motor recovery after stroke. Numerous studies have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate motor system plasticity. However, research on the reliability of TMS measures of motor cortex organization and excitability is limited. We sought to test the reliability of these TMS measurements.METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were tested twice over a two-week period using TMS to determine motor threshold, map topography, and stimulus-response curves for first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB), extensor digitorum communis (EDC), and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles.RESULTS: We found moderate to good test-retest reliability TMS measurements of motor threshold (ICC=0.90-0.97), map area (ICC=0.63-0.86) and location (ICC=0.69-0.86), and stimulus-response curves (ICC=0.60-0.83).CONCLUSIONS: TMS assessments of motor representation size, location, and excitability are generally reliable measures, although their reliability may vary according to the muscle under investigation.SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that TMS measurements of motor cortex function are reliable enough to be potentially useful in investigation of motor system plasticity.",Excluded
2538,"GDNF and TGF-beta1 promote cell survival in serum-free cultures of primary rat microglia Recent evidence indicates that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) may influence microglial survival, proliferation, and activation, but this has not yet been tested on isolated primary microglia. We compared the effects of individual and combined application of 10 ng/ml GDNF and 1 ng/ml transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) on total cell number, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, DNA nick-end labelling (TUNEL staining), and nitrite and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) secretion in serum-free cultures of primary rat microglia. GDNF as well as TGF-beta1 enhanced the total number of lectin-positive cells and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei, while no effect on proliferation was observed. Both factors suppressed the secretion of nitrite during the first 4 days of culturing, and GDNF but not TGF-beta1 reduced the secretion of LDH in 2-week-old cultures. These findings suggest that GDNF and TGF-beta1 support survival of primary microglia in vitro.",Excluded
2173,"Urethral pain among prostate cancer survivors 1 to 14 years after radiation therapy PURPOSE: To investigate how treatment-related and non-treatment-related factors impact urethral pain among long-term prostate cancer survivors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Men treated for prostate cancer with radiation therapy at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden from 1993 to 2006 were approached with a study-specific postal questionnaire addressing symptoms after treatment, including urethral burning pain during urination (n=985). The men had received primary or salvage external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT in combination with brachytherapy (BT). Prescribed doses were commonly 70 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions for primary and salvage EBRT and 50 Gy plus 2x10.0 Gy for EBRT+BT. Prostatic urethral doses were assessed from treatment records. We also recruited 350 non-pelvic-irradiated, population-based controls matched for age and residency to provide symptom background rates.RESULTS: Of the treated men, 16% (137 of 863) reported urethral pain, compared with 11% (27 of 242) of the controls. The median time to follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1.1-14.3 years). Prostatic urethral doses were similar to prescription doses for EBRT and 100% to 115% for BT. Fractionation-corrected dose and time to follow-up affected the occurrence of the symptom. For a follow-up>=3 years, 19% of men (52 of 268) within the 70-Gy EBRT+BT group reported pain, compared with 10% of men (23 of 222) treated with 70 Gy primary EBRT (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0). Of the men treated with salvage EBRT, 10% (20 of 197) reported urethral pain.CONCLUSIONS: Survivors treated with EBRT+BT had a higher risk for urethral pain compared with those treated with EBRT. The symptom prevalence decreased with longer time to follow-up. We found a relationship between fractionation-corrected urethral dose and pain. Among long-term prostate cancer survivors, the occurrence of pain was not increased above the background rate for prostatic urethral doses up to 70 Gy3.",Included
2560,"Relationship between histologic features and outcomes of carotid revascularization for radiation-induced stenosis OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between preoperative carotid imaging results, histologic characteristics, and surgical treatment outcomes of radiation-induced carotid stenosis (RICS), using control subjects without RICS for comparison.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 17 patients who underwent carotid revascularization for 22 instances of RICS, including 10 cases of carotid artery stenting (CAS), 11 cases of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and 1 case of CEA with retrograde CAS, between July 2004 and April 2013. The controls were 475 patients with no history of radiation therapy who underwent carotid revascularization in a similar period. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography angiography results were correlated with outcomes of histologic analysis of CEA specimens. End points included ipsilateral and contralateral stroke, myocardial infarction, restenosis, in-stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularization.RESULTS: Vulnerable plaques on carotid MRI (86% vs 64.2%; P = .010) and mobile (27% vs 8.0%; P = .008) and ulcerative (50% vs 15.8%; P < .001) plaques on US were more frequent in the RICS group. All revascularization procedures were successful, and no occlusion occurred. Adverse events in the CAS group, including one minor stroke and one transient ischemic attack within 30 days as well as five ipsilateral neurologic events after 30 days, including three minor strokes and two transient ischemic attacks, were significantly more frequent than in the CEA group. All three cases of late ipsilateral stroke displayed vulnerable plaque on preoperative MRI and late in-stent thrombosis or restenosis on US.CONCLUSIONS: Our radiologic and histologic analyses revealed that advanced RICS is often accompanied by formation of vulnerable plaque. CEA can prevent undesirable late outcomes in such cases.",Included
546,"Effects of low intensity static magnetic field on FTIR spectra and ROS production in SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells Biological effects of man-made electromagnetic fields (EMFs) have been studied so far by experimental approaches exposing animals and cell cultures to EMFs. However, the evidence for cell toxicity induced by static magnetic field (SMF) is still uncertain. We investigated the effects produced by the exposure of human SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells to a uniform magnetic field at intensities of 2.2 mT, which is less than the recommended public exposure limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). A decrease of membrane mitochondrial potential up to 30% was measured after 24 h of exposure to SMF in SH-SY5Y cells, and this effect was associated with reactive oxygen species production increase. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that exposure to a static magnetic intensity around 2.2 mT changed the secondary structure of cellular proteins and lipid components. The vibration bands relative to the methylene group increased significantly after 4 h of exposure, whereas further exposure up to 24 h produced evident shifts of amide I and II modes and a relative increase in beta-sheet contents with respect to alpha-helix components. Our study demonstrated that a moderate SMF causes alteration in cell homeostasis, as indicated by FTIR spectroscopy observations of changes in protein structures that are part of cell response to magnetic field exposure.",Excluded

In more recent years, stereotactic radiotherapy has rapidly advanced and is now commonly used for treatments of both cranial and extracranial lesions with high doses delivered in a few, down to a single fraction. The results of a workshop on Particle radiosurgery: A new frontier of physics in medicine held at Obergurgl, Austria during August 25-29 2013 are summarized in this issue with an overview presented in this paper. The focus was laid on particle radiosurgery but the content also includes current practice in x-ray radiosurgery and the overarching research in radiobiology and motion management for extracranial lesions.

2042,"Delayed central nervous system irradiation effects in rats--part 2: aggravation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) irradiation has detrimental effects which become evident within hours to few days and after a long latency of months and years. However, the delayed effect of irradiation on neuroimmune diseases has not been thoroughly examined.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the delayed effects of irradiation on the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is used as a model for neuroimmune inflammation and multiple sclerosis.METHODS: Adult male rats were exposed to a dose of 15 Gy given to the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Six months later, EAE was induced by inoculation of rat spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The disease was evaluated by clinical, histopathological and immunological parameters.RESULTS: Irradiated rats developed clinical signs of EAE earlier than the control group and their disease was much more severe. Unlike the control group, all rats in the EAE-irradiated group died within 5 days after the onset of clinical signs. Sections taken from irradiated rats showed diffuse and large hemorrhagic infiltrates of lymphocytes and granulocytes. In contrast, control rats displayed fewer infiltrates, which were less prominent and not hemorrhagic.CONCLUSIONS: CNS irradiation has a delayed effect that caused a marked aggravation of the clinical and pathological signs of EAE. The severity of the disease may be a consequence of the effect of irradiation on the CNS vascular bed and impaired blood-brain barrier.",Included
1629,"[Changes of EEG coherence in different stages of the formation of the psychoorganic syndrome] The group of liquidators of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident (n=170) with nonpsychotic mental disorders of exogenic-organic origin was studied. Patients were stratified into five groups on the basis of dominating symptoms in different stages of disorders: group 1 included patients with the prevalence of asthenic symptoms (n=104); group 2 - with the prevalence of autonomous disorders (n=37); group 3 - with the marked neurotic-like symptom complex (n=10); group 4 - with depressive symptoms (n=10); group 5 - with disturbances of cognitive function. The control group included 150 healthy people. Recording and mapping of coherence (COH) of the brain electrical activity was conducted using the apparatus-software complex for topographic mapping of brain electrical activity NEURO-CM (Russia) with the bandwidth from 0 to 40 Hz and the time constant of 0.3 sec. The EEG record was carried out monopolar from symmetrical cortical zones (10-20% scheme). Changes of COH were characterized by staging in patients compared to the controls. In the initial stage of disease, the integrative links were decreased in the temporal cortical zones of the left hemisphere. The reduction of functional activity in temporal-central cortical zones was found that might be the consequence of mesodiencephalic dysfunction. In the later stages, temporal zones of the right hemisphere were mostly affected. The parallel reinforcement of functional activity of occipital zones, in particular, the increase of 'long links' with frontal areas, was noted in the overall formation of the psychoorganic syndrome. This phenomenon may be considered as a compensatory mechanism when the phylogenetically older cortical zones, which are more resistant to pathological changes, become leaders in the realization of integrative brain activity during the development of a pathological state.",Included
1491,"Long-term results of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation in limited small cell lung cancer Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a chemoresponsive tumor but overall survival remains poor even in limited disease (LD). With the aim of eradicating chemoresistant tumor cells and reducing toxicity, we investigated in this phase II trial the feasibility and outcome of a sequential approach of induction chemotherapy (CT) followed, in responding patients with LD-SCLC, by intensified platinum-based CT and concurrent thoracic irradiation (TI). Material(s) and Method(s): We treated 55 consecutive LD-SCLC patients with three 21-day cycles of cyclophosphamide, epiadriamycin and vincristine (CEV) as induction CT. In 44 (80%) patients there was an objective response and they received treatment intensification consisting of TI and concomitant CT with carboplatin and etoposide plus recombinant granulocite colony stimulating factor. Twenty-five (57%) patients were submitted to twice-daily thoracic irradiation (TDTI; 1.5 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 45 Gy) and 19 (43%) to once-daily thoracic irradiation (ODTI; 2 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 50 Gy). Result(s): Median follow up was 75 months (range, 42-102). Of 44 patients submitted to intensification with TI plus CT, 32 (73%) had a complete and 12 (27%) a partial response. Median overall survival of all 55 patients was 17 months with actuarial survival probabilities of 2 and 5 years, 32 and 25%, respectively. Analysis of patient sub-groups showed a 5-month median survival in non-responders, 19 in TDTI and 17 in ODTI patients, respectively. Two and 5 year survival probabilities were 0% in non-responders, 40 and 35% in TDTI and 39 and 21% in ODTI patients, respectively. At present, 13 of 44 responders are still alive, of which nine (20%) have been progression-free from 45 to 93 months (median 60). Treatment failure was registered in 31 (70%) of 44 patients who received both induction and intensification treatment. One-half of patients had intrathoracic recurrence, eight of which only local and the remaining seven local and distant. Fourteen (32%) patients had brain metastases. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 24 (55%) patients with no differences between treatment groups. Grade 3 esophagitis was registered in four (9%) patients: in 3/25 (12%) and 1/19 (5%) of those who received TDTI and ODTI, respectively (P=not significant). Acute radiation pneumonitis occurred in three (12%) patients submitted to TDTI. No clinically debilitating pulmonary fibrosis, permanent esophageal stricture or toxic death was observed. Conclusion(s): In LD-SCLC patients late concurrent CT plus TI is feasible and effective. Our long-term results are similar to the best reported in the literature. Despite the high incidence of complete response obtained, however, one-half of the patients had intrathoracic relapse and one-third brain metastases. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

2910,"Re-irradiation with hypo-fractionated stereotactic robotic radiotherapy for salvage in adult patients with brainstem glioma PURPOSE: Brainstem glioma (BSG) is often treated with definitive irradiation. However, subsequent progression and death occur as a rule rather than the exception, after varying periods of control. The outlook of patients with post-irradiation progression is dismal, and most of these patients are treated with supportive care alone. Despite the obvious risks with an area as critical as the brainstem, it is a possibility to encounter situations wherein the patients (themselves or their associates) ask for re-irradiation, with the hope of a few extra months of life. The risk of radiation-induced brainstem toxicity may be justifiable under the strict assumption that the patients stand a chance of benefiting from re-irradiation but still may not live long enough to manifest brainstem toxicity.METHODS: Five adult BSG patients were treated with re-irradiation using robotic-arm stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) between September 2009 and July 2012, primarily at the request of the concerned patient parties. Re-irradiation doses ranged from 16 to 25 Gray (Gy) delivered by robotic arm stereotactic irradiation in 2-5 fractions.RESULTS: Four out of five patients enjoyed a prolongation of survival in the order of months (three, five, six, and 14 months), which was very significant given that all patients had severe neurological compromise and poor performance status prior to re-irradiation. One patient has survived 36 months after re-irradiation and thus has lived long enough to manifest late radiation-induced brainstem toxicity.CONCLUSION: Despite the obvious risks of brainstem toxicity associated with the use of re-irradiation for BSG, the use of fractionated stereotactic re-irradiation seems to offers prospects of additional periods of local control and augments duration of life.",Excluded
1611,"Mechanisms of postspaceflight orthostatic hypotension: Low alpha <inf>1</inf>-adrenergic receptor responses before flight and central autonomic dysregulation postflight Although all astronauts experience symptoms of orthostatic intolerance after short-duration spaceflight, only ~20% actually experience presyncope during upright posture on landing day. The presyncopal group is characterized by low vascular resistance before and after flight and low norepinephrine release during orthostatic stress on landing day. Our purpose was to determine the mechanisms of the differences between presyncopal and nonpresyncopal groups. We studied 23 astronauts 10 days before launch, on landing day, and 3 days after landing. We measured pressor responses to phenylephrine injections; norepinephrine release with tyramine injections; plasma volumes; resting plasma levels of chromogranin A (a marker of sympathetic nerve terminal release), endothelin, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG, an intracellular metabolite of norepinephrine); and lymphocyte beta<inf>2</inf>-adrenergic receptors. We then measured hemodynamic and neurohumoral responses to upright tilt. Astronauts were separated into two groups according to their ability to complete 10 min of upright tilt on landing day. Compared with astronauts who were not presyncopal on landing day, presyncopal astronauts had 1) significantly smaller pressor responses to phenylephrine both before and after flight; 2) significantly smaller baseline norepinephrine, but significantly greater DHPG levels, on landing day; 3) significantly greater norepinephrine release with tyramine on landing day; and 4) significantly smaller norepinephrine release, but significantly greater epinephrine and arginine vasopressin release, with upright tilt on landing day. These data suggest that the etiology of orthostatic hypotension and presyncope after spaceflight includes low alpha<inf>1</inf>-adrenergic receptor responsiveness before flight and a remodeling of the central nervous system during spaceflight such that sympathetic responses to baroreceptor input become impaired.",Excluded
1314,"Effects of obesity on noninvasive test results in patients with suspected cardiac ischemia: Insights from the PROMISE trial BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), but adiposity may mimic symptoms of CAD and reduce the accuracy of diagnostic testing.METHODS: Patients from the PROMISE trial (n=8889) were classified according to body mass index (BMI). We assessed relationships between BMI, physician's preference of functional test, test positivity, and results of invasive coronary angiography (Cath) using logistic regression models.RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of the patients had BMI>=30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 20% had BMI>=35. Providers were more likely to prefer nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) over other functional tests as BMI increased. The rate of test positivity with coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was not different (10% vs. 12%) in patients with BMI >=35 vs. < 35. The same was true for stress echocardiogram and stress electrocardiogram (positivity 8-13%, P>0.8 for both). In contrast, MPI was significantly more likely to be positive in those with BMI >=35 vs. <35 (18% vs. 13%; P=0.001). The likelihood of obstructive CAD at Cath did not differ with BMI >=35 vs. <35 in patients having CTA (52% vs. 59%, P=0.22), but among MPI patients, Cath positivity was only 29% with BMI >=35 vs. 48% with BMI <35 (P=0.005). Radiation exposure increased with higher BMI in both MPI and CTA groups.CONCLUSIONS: Increasing levels of obesity adversely affect the diagnostic yield of MPI more than CTA. The degree of obesity should be considered when choosing evaluation strategies for patients with chest pain.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROMISE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01174550.",Excluded

We asked whether irradiation induced senescence in mouse hippocampus, and whether p53 or p21 played a role in this response. Following whole-brain irradiation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays for senescence-associated genes showed increased expression of CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p19ARF) in mouse hippocampus at 9 weeks. Upregulation of p21 and p19ARF was confirmed using real-time PCR, which also demonstrated increased CDKN2A/p16INKa expression after irradiation. No altered regulation of another 17 senescence-associated genes was observed after irradiation. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased nuclear expression of p16INK4A, p19ARF, p53, p21, phosphorylated p38 (pp38), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and interleukin-6 (IL6) in granule cells of dentate gyrus after irradiation. Increased p16 nuclear immunoreactivity was further observed in type -1 cells, the putative neural stem cells. gamma-phosphorylated-histone-2A nuclear foci were also seen in dentate gyrus 9 weeks postirradiation. In nonirradiated mice knockout of the TRP53 or p21 gene, there was increased p16INK4A, p19ARF, and IL6, but not pp38 in dentate gyrus. We conclude that irradiation induces transcript and protein expression profile alterations in mouse dentate gyrus consistent with the senescence phenotype. Absence of p53 or p21 results in increase in baseline expression of senescence markers with no further increase in expression after irradiation.",Included

Transmission scans (3 min per step, eight or nine steps according to the height of the subject) in 2D mode were used for subsequent attenuation correction of emission scans. Emission scans (1 min per step, eight or nine steps) were acquired over 2 h. Venous blood samples and urine were collected up to 2 h after injection of the radiotracer. For each subject, the percentage of injected activity measured in regions of interest over brain, intestine, lungs, kidneys and liver was fitted to a mono-exponential model, as an uptake phase followed by a mono-exponential washout, for urinary bladder to generate time-activity curves. Using the MIRD method, several source organs were considered in estimating residence time and mean effective radiation absorbed doses.RESULTS: Blood pressure and ECG findings remained unchanged after tracer injection. The analysed blood and urine pharmacological parameters did not change significantly after [(11)C]raclopride injection. The primary routes of clearance were renal and intestinal. Ten minutes after injection, high activities were observed in the gall-bladder, kidneys and liver. High activity was observed in the gall-bladder during the whole study. The kidneys, urinary bladder wall, liver and gall-bladder received the highest absorbed doses. The average effective dose of [11C]raclopride was estimated to be 6.7+/-0.4 microSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: The amount of [11C]raclopride required for adequate dopamine D2 receptor imaging results in an acceptable effective dose equivalent, permitting two or three repeated clinical PET imaging studies, with the injection of 222 MBq for each study.",Excluded

41,"Long-term correlation of the electrocorticogram as a bioindicator of brain exposure to ionizing radiation Understanding the effects of radiation and its possible influence on the nervous system are of great clinical interest.However, there have been few electrophysiological studies on brain activity after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR).A new methodological approach regarding the assessment of the possible effects of IR on brain activity is the use of linear and nonlinear mathematical methods in the analysis of complex time series, such as brain oscillations measured using the electrocorticogram (ECoG).The objective of this study was to use linear and nonlinear mathematical methods as biomarkers of gamma radiation regarding cortical electrical activity.Adult Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: 1 control and 2 irradiated groups, evaluated at 24 h (IR24) and 90 days (IR90) after exposure to 18 Gy of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 radiotherapy source.The ECoG was analyzed using power spectrum methods for the calculation of the power of delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms and by means of the alpha-exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).Using both mathematical methods it was possible to identify changes in the ECoG, and to identify significant changes in the pattern of the recording at 24 h after irradiation.Some of these changes were persistent at 90 days after exposure to IR.In particular, the theta wave using the two methods showed higher sensitivity than other waves, suggesting that it is a possible biomarker of exposure to IR.

By contrast, many thoracic imaging specialists may be underutilizing thoracic MRI. Recognizing the potential value of thoracic MRI to patient care, we set out to increase its utilization. Material(s) and Method(s): In late 2008 we began updating our nonvascular thoracic MR protocols, incorporating a combination of body and cardiac MRtechniques, creating a more high quality, interpretable examination by consultation with MR applications specialists and cardiac MR technologists and by imaging of volunteers. We reviewed MR protocol principles with our thoracic imaging division and began to show current MR cases regularly at our weekly thoracic imaging case conference. We educated our technologists with in-service presentations and hands-onMR imaging of volunteers to familiarize them with issues and challenges particular to thoracicMRimaging.We have trained our thoracic imaging fellows to protocol, monitor, and interpret these studies and have been educating our referring physicians about MR's value in increasing diagnostic specificity, guiding surgical approach, and preventing unnecessary interventional procedures without radiation exposure. We also retrospectively reviewed thoracic MR utilization from 2009 through 2012. Result(s): Our thoracic MR volume increased from 18 cases in 2009 to 88 cases in 2012 totalling 219 examinations over this period-182 mediastinal, 28 full chest, 5 focused pleural, 2 superior sulcus, and 2 combined neck/upper chest (these numbers exclude brachial plexus MRIs interpreted by our Musculoskeletal Imaging division). Indications included further characterization of thymic, other mediastinal, and pleural lesions, follow-up of thoracic lymphadenopathy, and assessment of chest wall/vascular invasion by lung cancer and mesothelioma. Internists requested 130/219 studies (59%) and surgeons requested 89/219 (41%), with many repeat referrals indicative of a new recognition of thoracic MR's value.

36,"Radiosurgical ablation of spinal cord AVM Objective: Intramedullary spinal cord arteriovenous malformations (AVMs ) are very rare lesions which are characteristically associated with recurrent hemorrhage and progressive ischemia. Although favorable location, size and vascular anatomy make it sometimes possible to manage this condition with embolization and/or microsurgical resection, there are no good treatment options for many, if not most, of these lesions. Given such poor prospects, the senior author began in 1997 investigating Cy-berKnife radiosurgical ablation as a tool for managing selected patients with intramedullary spinal cord AVMs. Although a previous paper in 2006 reported the preliminary experience from Stanford, our understanding has grown significantly as follow-up was extended and more patients were treated. Herein, we retrospectively analyze our longer term experience with a primary radiosurgical approach to spinal cord AVM. Method(s): Thirty patients (17 females: 13 males) with a median age of 33 years and intramedullary spinal cord AVMs (18 cervical, 9 thoracic, and three conus medullaris) were treated with CyberKnife SRS between 1997 and 2008. A history of hemorrhage was present in 57% of cases, while in 50% of patients previous treatment included microsurgery (6/29) or embolization (11/29). The mean AVM volume was 2.8 cc (0.2-15cc) was treated to mean marginal dose of 20Gy in one to four sessions (median 2). Based on our growing experience, the biologically effective dose (BED) of radiation was escalated gradually over the course of this study. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up were carried out annually, and spinal angiography was repeated at 3 years. Result(s): After a mean follow-up period of 63 months (median 54), the treated AVM was completely obliterated in 8 cases (27%) and significantly decreased in size in an additional 11 cases (64%) among the 22 angiographically studied patients with more than 3 years of follow-up. Pre-radiosurgery neurologic symptoms improved in more than 50% of cases, but worsened in three (10%). There was one instance (3%) of radiation-induced myelopathy occurring within one year of radiosurgery. Notably, after 158 years of collective post SRS follow-up, no patient suffered a hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): Although our understanding is still incomplete, CyberKnife radiosurgery Results in total obliteration or shrinkage for most intramedullary spinal cord AVM, a phenomenon that may beaccompanied by a marked decrease in the risk of bleeding. Symptom improvement is also common in most cases. More experience is required to determine the optimal radiosurgical dosing and consequent related efficacy.

Such a direct comparison between different EMFs - especially those employed in daily life - on the same biological endpoint, is very useful for drawing conclusions on their bioactivity, and novel. It shows that real MT EMFs are far more damaging than 50 Hz alternating magnetic field (MF) - similar or much stronger to those of power lines - or a pulsed electric field (PEF) found before to increase fertility. The MT EMFs were significantly more bioactive even for much shorter exposure durations than the other EMFs. Moreover, they were more damaging than previously tested cytotoxic agents like certain chemicals, starvation, dehydration. Individual parameters of the real MT EMFs like intensity, frequency, exposure duration, polarization, pulsing, modulation, are discussed in terms of their role in bioactivity. The crucial parameter for the intense bioactivity seems to be the extreme variability of the polarized MT signals, mainly due to the large unpredictable intensity changes.

402,"Effect of ac and dc magnetic field orientation on nerve cells Recent tests of the influence of parallel ac and dc magnetic fields on neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells showed good agreement with the predictions of an ion parametric resonance model. However, experimental results from earlier work involving both a perpendicular (160 mG) and a parallel (366 mG) dc magnetic field were not as consistent with the ion parametric resonance model predictions. Test results reported here show that the cell response to perpendicular ac and de magnetic fields is distinct and predictably different from that found for parallel ac and dc magnetic fields, and that the response to perpendicular fields is dominant in an intensity-dependent nonlinear manner.",Excluded
1431,"Motexafin gadolinium: a novel redox active drug for cancer therapy Motexafin gadolinium (MGd, Xcytrin) is an aromatic macrocycle that has a strong affinity for electrons, i.e., it is easily reduced. In the presence of oxygen, MGd accepts electrons from various cellular reducing metabolites and forms superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) by redox cycling. The reaction with NADPH is dramatically accelerated by various oxido-reductases including thioredoxin reductase. In vitro studies with various cancer cell lines have shown an increase in ROS and intracellular free zinc in cells treated with MGd. MGd increases cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation and various chemotherapy agents and may be directly cytotoxic to tumor cells under certain conditions. MGd selectively localizes in tumors, perhaps due to their metabolic perturbations. MGd treatment in murine models enhances tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy agents. In controlled, randomized clinical trials, combining MGd treatment with ionizing radiation improves time to neurologic progression in lung cancer patients with brain metastases. The molecular target for MGd appears to be thioredoxin reductase which, when inhibited, results in cellular redox stress, cytotoxicity and an increase in tumor responsiveness to a variety of treatments.

1740,"Skin dose to patients from interventional radiology and cardiology procedures with potentially long fluoroscopy times The increasing frequency and complexity of interventional procedures means that there is an increasing potential for the patient to suffer radiation-induced skin injuries. Dose measurements were initiated in a number of radiology, neuroradiology and cardiology departments in the Northern Ireland region which carry out interventlonal procedures with potentially long fluoroscopy times. The intention was to measure patient skin dose and thus estimate the likelihood of deterministic effects occurring from such examinations. For each patient, several thermoluminescence (TL) dosemeters were placed on the areas of skin the radiologist or cardiologist considered were most likely to receive the greatest irradiation. Results are presented which indicate that several types of procedure have the potential to produce deterministic effects to patients' skin. It was concluded that skin dose should be routinely measured for each patient undergoing an interventional radiology procedure which has potentially a long fluoroscopy time.",Excluded

This syndrome involves a significantly decreased number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons compared to that in normal cells., the rate of fork movement and the fusion of neighbouring units in the group being unchanged. Ionizing radiation (5 Gy) does not change the rate of DNA chain growth in the cells derived from the affected individuals, however, it significantly reduces this parameter in normal cells due to inhibition of replicon initiation in the whole clusters. Thus, radioresistant DNA synthesis in chromosomal instability syndromes may be explained by some defect in DNA replication in unirradiated cells analogous to that in irradiated normal cells.",Included

These two modes of repair were characterized and compared between the aforementioned EPF, A. niger and N. crassa using a physiological assay where per cent survival post-UV irradiation was scored as colony forming units.CONCLUSIONS: The results showed B. bassiana and M. anisopliae are the most UV-tolerant EPF. The DNA repair capabilities indicated that EPF do not have all DNA repair options available to fungi, such as A. niger and N. crassa.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A key factor detrimental to the survival of EPF in agro-ecosystems is UV light from solar radiation. The EPF literature pertaining to UV irradiation is varied with respect to methodology, UV source, and dose, which prevented comparisons.

The uptake of systemically administered rhodamine-ferritin complex by capillary endothelial cells (CECs) of the cerebral cortex was dependent on power density and on duration of exposure. At 5 mW/cm2, for example, a 15-min exposure had no effect. Near-complete blockade of uptake resulted when rats were treated before exposure to microwaves with a single dose of colchicine, which inhibits microtubular function. A pinocytotic-like mechanism is presumed responsible for the microwave-induced increase in BBB permeability.",Excluded

945,"Copper-induced conformational changes in the N-terminal domain of the Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase The Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase plays a critical role in the intracellular trafficking of copper. Mutations in this protein lead to the accumulation of a toxic level of copper in the liver, kidney, and brain followed by extensive tissue damage and death. The ATPase has a novel amino-terminal domain ( approximately 70 kDa) which contains six repeats of the copper binding motif GMTCXXC. We have expressed and characterized this domain with respect to the copper binding sites and the conformational consequences of copper binding. A detailed analysis of this domain by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has revealed that each binding site ligates copper in the +1 oxidation state using two cysteine side chains with distorted linear geometry. Analysis of copper-induced conformational changes in the amino-terminal domain indicates that both secondary and tertiary structure changes take place upon copper binding. These copper-induced conformational changes could play an important role in the function and regulation of the ATPase in vivo. In addition to providing important insights on copper binding to the protein, these results suggest a possible mechanism of copper trafficking by the Wilson disease ATPase.",Excluded
2440,"Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation after cranial irradiation with (56)Fe particles Exposure to heavy-ion radiation is considered a potential health risk in long-term space travel. In the central nervous system (CNS), loss of critical cellular components may lead to performance decrements that could ultimately compromise mission goals and long-term quality of life. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments occur after exposure to ionizing radiation, and while the pathogenesis of this effect is not yet clear, it may involve the production of newly born neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We irradiated mice with 0.5-4 Gy of (56)Fe ions and 2 months later quantified neurogenesis and numbers of activated microglia as a measure of neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that there were few changes after 0.5 Gy, but that there was a dose-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and a dose-related increase in numbers of newly born activated microglia from 0.5-4.0 Gy. While those findings were similar to what was reported after X irradiation, there were also some differences, particularly in the response of newly born glia. Overall, this study showed that hippocampal neurogenesis was sensitive to relatively low doses of (56)Fe particles, and that those effects were associated with neuroinflammation. Whether these changes will result in functional impairments or if/how they can be managed are topics for further investigation.",Included
1986,"Evaluation of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other tremors: Survival of neurons adjacent to the thalamic lesion after gamma thalamotomy Object. The effects of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other kinds of tremor were evaluated. Methods. Thirty-six thalamotomies were performed in 31 patients by using a 4-mm collimator. The maximum dose was 150 Gy in the initial six cases, which was reduced to 130 Gy thereafter. The longest follow-up period was 6 years. The target was determined on T<inf>2</inf>-weighted and proton magnetic resonance (MR) images. The point chosen was in the lateral-most part of the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus. This is in keeping with open thalamotomy as practiced at the authors' institution. In 15 cases, gamma thalamotomy was the first surgical procedure. In other cases, previous therapeutic or vascular lesions were visible to facilitate targeting. Two types of tissue reaction were onserved on MR imaging: a simple oval shape and a complex irregular shape. Neither of these changes affected the clinical course. In the majority of cases, the tremor subsided after a latent interval of approximately 1 year after irradiation. The earliest response was demonstrated at 3 months. In five cases the tremor remained. In four of these cases, a second radiation session was administered. One of these four patients as well as another patient with an unsatisfactory result underwent open thalamotomy with microrecording. In both cases, depth recording adjacent to the necrotic area revealed normal neuronal activity, including the rhythmic discharge of tremor. Minor coagulation was performed and resulted in immediate and complete arrest of the remaining tremor. Conclusions. Gamma thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease seems to be an alternative useful method in selected cases.",Excluded

1638,"A prospective study of thyroid function after radiotherapy for central nervous system and head and neck malignancies Purpose/Objective: Few studies evaluate endocrine gland function following radiotherapy (RT). We conducted a single-institution prospective study to understand the effect of RT on pituitary and thyroid function in adults. Material(s) and Method(s): Adult patients who received fractionated RT for non-metastatic head and neck cancer and benign intracranial neoplasms were eligible. Patients with a history of thyroid, pituitary, or hypothalamic surgery or baseline hormonal supplementation were excluded. Baseline endocrine labs were obtained prior to RT and at 6- month intervals for 5 years. A dose-volume histogram report was generated for the hypothalamus, thyroid, and pituitary gland. Hypothyroidism (HT) was defined as TSH level > 5.0 mIU/L or T4 < 0.8 ng/dL. The primary endpoint was to establish the incidence and threshold dose for RT-related endocrine dysfunction. This interim analysis reports on thyroid function for the first 50 of a planned 200 patients enrolled. Result(s): From October 2006 to May 2008, 50 patients were enrolled with a median follow up of 67 months (range, 17-82 months). Forty-two patients were treated for head and neck (HN) cancers, and eight were treated for benign central nervous (CNS) tumors. No patient was on thyroid supplementation at baseline. The median prescription dose was 6000 cGy in 30 fractions (range, 4500-7000 cGy). Thirty-six patients (72%) were treated adjuvantly and 31 patients (62%) also received concurrent chemotherapy. Primary HT incidence was 60% (n=30) at a median of 12 months (range, 2.9-58.7). The 12-, 24-, 48-, and 60-month freedom from thyroid dysfunction was 78%, 52%, 47.5%, and 33.7%, respectively. Twenty-one patients (42%) received thyroid replacement therapy with a median time to therapy of 3.5 months after diagnosis of HT. The mean thyroid dose in patients with HT was 6136 cGy (range, 3958-6930) compared to 2825 cGy (range, 0-7032) for those without HT. The incidence of HT was 11% (n=2) vs. 87.5% (n=28) for patients with a mean thyroid dose below vs. above 5000 cGy, respectively (p<0.0001). No secondary HT was observed, and the mean pituitary dose for patients with HT was 1065 cGy. Significant risk factors for HT identified on univariate analysis included mean thyroid dose above 5000 cGy <0.0001), concurrent chemotherapy (p=0.029), and HN vs. CNS radiation (p=0.004). Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that patients who receive a mean thyroid dose > 5000 cGy are at increased risk for primary HT after RT. Median time to HT is 12 months, but can occur as early as 3 months post- RT. Routine regular laboratory assessment with prompt appropriate thyroid supplementation is recommended.",Excluded
3557,"The inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced neuronal apoptosis via AMPKalpha1 signaling-mediated autophagy Purpose/Objective(s): In our previous study, we have found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis shortly after radiation. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the detailed mechanisms underlying the protective effect of minocycline on neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis. Purpose/Objective(s): The immortalized mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cell line was used. The protective effect of minocycline on X-irradiated HT22 cells was demonstrated using clonogenic assay and apoptosis analysis. The underlying mechanisms were explored by using methods such as flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, shRNA knockdown, Western blot et al. Result(s): We found that minocycline protected HT22 hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced cell death, manifest as increased clonogenic cell survival and decreased apoptosis in irradiated cells. This protective effect of minocycline might involve cell cycle perturbation after radiation, but not DNA damage and repair. Further investigation showed that X-irradiation activated AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy, and minocycline significantly enhanced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of minocycline might not be involved in the enhancing effect of minocycline on radiation-induced autophagy, but it might at least partially contribute to the inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced apoptosis. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis mainly through targeting radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included

Method(s): An epileptic rat model of MCD was established with the F1 generation of pregnant rats after X-irradiation with 175 cGy (Group L), 195 cGy (Group M), or 215 cGy (Group H). Long-term video-EEG monitoring was used to record the seizures in the rats with MCD. Cognition was assessed with the Morris water maze. The EEGs were recorded and analyzed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats. Finally, the brain tissues were processed for Nissl staining. Result(s): The model groups exhibited markedly prolonged escape latencies and distinct decrements in the percent distance traveled in the target quadrant and platform-crossing frequency. These findings were dose-dependent. Frequent interictal epileptiform discharges were observed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats, and their incidences were markedly higher in the model groups compared with that in the normal controls, with Group M having the highest incidence. Spontaneous seizures were observed in the model groups (mean incidence, 46.7%). The daily mean frequency of seizures and the incidence of spontaneous seizures were highest in Group M. Nissl staining revealed a dose-dependent pattern of hippocampal abnormalities, cortical and subcortical nodular heterotopia, and callosal agenesis in the model groups. Conclusion(s): The 195 cGy dose was most appropriate for establishing an epileptic model of MCD with X-irradiation. Copyright © 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

336,"Melatonin receptor density in Area X of European starlings is correlated with reproductive state and is unaffected by plasma melatonin concentration Several of the song control nuclei of songbirds, including HVc (higher vocal center) and Area X, contain melatonin receptor (MelR). In laboratory-housed male starlings, the densities of MelR in Area X change markedly according to reproductive state. MelR are down-regulated when starlings are photostimulated (in full breeding condition) and are subsequently up-regulated when starlings become photorefractory (reproductively quiescent). However, seasonal regulation of MelR densities in Area X has only been investigated during the light phase of the light:dark cycle. Variation in MelR densities are physiologically relevant only if they also occur during the dark phase, when melatonin is present in the circulation. Brains from male starlings that were in different reproductive states but exposed to the same 18L:6D photoperiod were collected during either the mid-point of the light phase or the dark phase. Melatonin receptor distribution was assessed in vitro by 125Iodomelatonin (IMEL) receptor autoradiography. All photostimulated birds exhibited down-regulation of MelR in Area X, and all photorefractory birds exhibited high MelR density in Area X, regardless of time of sampling or plasma melatonin concentration. Thus, within each reproductive state, MelR density in Area X did not differ over the course of a circadian cycle. The functional significance of seasonal regulation of MelR in this song control nucleus remains unclear, but it is likely to involve a release of cellular inhibition by melatonin during photostimulation, with possible consequences for song learning, memory consolidation or regulation of the context of song production.",Excluded

3225,"Interstitial irradiation with stereotactically implanted I-125 seeds for the treatment of cerebral glioma Owing to its low rate of side effects and its high efficacy, interstitial irradiation with low-activity seeds should be the first therapeutic step in small (maximal diameter 40 mm), well-circumscribed, low-grade gliomas affecting the brain stem, other midline structures, or eloquent cerebral areas. In anaplastic gliomas, a therapeutic schedule using low-activity seeds and combining interstitial irradiation with radiotherapy (reduced boost dose of 15-30 Gy) seems to be more effective than interstitial irradiation alone. Compared with interstitial irradiation with high-activity seeds, this combined irradiation schedule caused no space-occupying radiation necrosis. Thus, it can be recommended as up-front treatment in patients with small (maximal diameter <40 mm) inoperable anaplastic gliomas. The use of high-activity I-125 seeds and interstitial irradiation at comparably high dose rates, integrating a small penumbra of normal brain tissue into the treatment volume, improved survival significantly in patients with primary highly malignant gliomas. In patients with recurrent tumors, the same treatment schedule did not substantially prolong survival compared with results obtained after resection plus radiotherapy. Owing to the high frequency of space-occupying radiation necrosis (40-60%), this schedule is only applicable in surgically accessible tumors. The application of low-activity I-125 seeds (in primary glioblastomas in combination with radiotherapy, in recurrent tumors without radiotherapy) yielded a median survival comparable with conventionally treated patients. There was no need for reoperation because of radiation necrosis. Thus, this treatment schedule is useful in both operable and surgically inaccessible glioblastomas.",Excluded
3378,"Radial vs femoral approach: Does access point influence occupational radiation head dose to scrub nurses? Background: There has been a notable trend towards using a radial approach during cardiac angiography in recent years.

Objective(s): This study sought to determine whether head dose to operators and scrub nurses was affected by the choice of arterial access route. Method(s): A prospective study was performed over a period of 8 months monitoring the head dose to in-room personnel during both diagnostic and interventional coronary angiography cases. Data were collected using electronic detectors worn on the left temple by staff. The correlation between head dose to operating physician and the scrub nurse for both femoral and radial access points was evaluated. Result(s): The head dose to scrub nurses was significantly higher during radial cases compared with femoral access.

2100,"Clinical application of monitoring techniques: radioisotopic methods The availability of mobile gamma cameras or the nearness of nuclear medicine devices to the coronary care unit make the assessment of transient myocardial ischemia by radioisotopic techniques practical. Nuclear cardiology provides information on the presence, site and extent of ischemia and helps the clinician in the evaluation of myocardial functional impairment and recovery. Monitoring of myocardial wall motion by radionuclide ventriculography demonstrates that during angina at rest; global ejection fraction is not always sensitive to regional ischemia; episodes of angina with undetectable electrocardiographic signs of ischemia can be associated with severe myocardial dysfunction; separate left and right phase analysis of radionuclide ventriculography is a sensitive tool to assess segmental dyssynergy localized to the left or the right ventricle; a prevalent right ventricular impairment during ischemia, not measurable by Thallium scintigraphy, is possible; the recovery of function after ischemia is usually fast and apparently complete. In addition, useful diagnostic information can be derived by left ventricular injection of radioactive microspheres during cardiac catheterization followed by gated acquisitions of the intramyocardial radioactivity. Gated microsphere acquisitions, providing diastolic and systolic images, avoid blurring of images due to cardiac motion and enhance contrast between myocardium and background: the overall result is an improved detection and definition of small perfusion defects. Furthermore, this technique permits simultaneous assessment of regional perfusion and wall motion. An appraisal of potential mismatches between flow and function after revascularization procedures can be recognized by this approach. The development of technology is improving the performance of nuclear medicine instrumentation, hampered, at present, by limited spatial and temporal resolution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

However, observation periods were not long enough to allow confirmation of the long-term safety of SRS alone in patients with 5 to 10 BMs.METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was a prospective observational study of Gamma Knife SRS-treated patients with 1 to 10 newly diagnosed BMs enrolled at 23 facilities between March 1, 2009, and February 15, 2012.RESULTS: The 1194 eligible patients were categorized into the following groups: group A, 1 tumor (n=455); group B, 2 to 4 tumors (n=531); and group C, 5 to 10 tumors (n=208). Cumulative rates of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score maintenance (MMSE score decrease <3 from baseline) determined with a competing risk analysis of groups A, B, and C were 93%, 91%, and 92%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 91%, 89%, and 91%, respectively, at the 24th month; 89%, 88%, and 89%, respectively, at the 36th month; and 87%, 86%, and 89%, respectively, at the 48th month (hazard ratio [HR] of group A vs group B, 0.719; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.437-1.172; P=.18; HR of group B vs group C, 1.280; 95% CI, 0.696-2.508; P=.43). During observations ranging from 0.3 to 67.5 months (median, 12.0 months; interquartile range, 5.8-26.5 months), as of December 2014, 145 patients (12.1%) had SRS-induced complications. Cumulative complication incidences by competing risk analysis for groups A, B, and C were 7%, 8%, and 6%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 10%, 11%, and 11%, respectively, at the 24th month; 11%, 11%, and 12%, respectively, at the 36th month; and 12%, 12%, and 13%, respectively, at the 48th month (HR of group A vs group B, 0.850; 95% CI, 0.592-1.220; P=.38; HR of group B vs group C, 1.052; 95% CI, 0.666-1.662, P=.83).

Spearman's rank correlation was calculated between NCF and QOL, using each patient's own data, at each time point. To test the hypothesis that NCF declines before QOL changes, the predictive effect of NCF from previous visits on QOL was studied with a linear mixed-effects model. Neurocognitive function or QOL deterioration was defined relative to each patient's own baseline. Lead or lag time, defined as NCF deterioration before or after the date of QOL decline, respectively, was computed.RESULTS: At baseline, all NCF tests showed statistically significant correlations with ADL, which became stronger at 4 months. A similar observation was made with FACT-Br. Neurocognitive function scores from previous visits predicted ADL (p < 0.05 for seven of eight tests) or FACT-Br. Scores on all eight NCF tests deteriorated before ADL decline (net lead time 9-153 days); and scores on six of eight NCF tests deteriorated before FACT-Br (net lead time 9-82 days).CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive function and QOL are correlated. Neurocognitive function scores from previous visits are predictive of QOL. Neurocognitive function deterioration precedes QOL decline. The sequential association between NCF and QOL decline suggests that delaying NCF deterioration is a worthwhile treatment goal in brain metastases patients.",Excluded
2091,"Computed tomography super-resolution using deep convolutional neural network The objective of this study is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for computed tomography (CT) image super-resolution. The network learns an end-to-end mapping between low (thick-slice thickness) and high (thin-slice thickness) resolution images using the modified U-Net. To verify the proposed method, we train and test the CNN using axially averaged data of existing thin-slice CT images as input and their middle slice as the label. Fifty-two CT studies are used as the CNN training set, and 13 CT studies are used as the test set. We perform five-fold cross-validation to confirm the performance consistency. Because all input and output images are used in two-dimensional slice format, the total number of slices for training the CNN is 7670. We assess the performance of the proposed method with respect to the resolution and contrast, as well as the noise properties. The CNN generates output images that are virtually equivalent to the ground truth. The most remarkable image-recovery improvement by the CNN is deblurring of boundaries of bone structures and air cavities. The CNN output yields an approximately 10% higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and lower normalized root mean square error than the input (thicker slices). The CNN output noise level is lower than the ground truth and equivalent to the iterative image reconstruction result. The proposed deep learning method is useful for both super-resolution and de-noising.",Excluded
3013,"[Histochemical and ultrastructural studies on anti-edematous and radiation-protective action of 0-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutosides on the rat brain after single irradiation. 2. Histochemical study on carbohydrate metabolism and acid phosphatase activation] The disturbances of the carbohydrate metabolism and the activation of acid phosphatases with and without protection by O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside (HR) were studied in irradiated rat brains by means of the light microscope. The histochemically demonstrable deposition of glycogen and acid mucopolysaccharides serves as a criterion for a reversible lesion of the irradiated cerebral tissue. The extent of local activation of repair processes following to irradiation can be determined by the quantity of acid phosphatases in the lysosomes. For the dose range of 1 to 5 Gy, HR seems to exert a protective effect on the cellular metabolism of the irradiated cerebral tissue shown by a slight decrease of glycogen and mucopolysaccharide deposits compared to the untreated animals. However, when exceeding a threshold dose of 10 Gy, the deposition of carbohydrates in the HR group is strongly increased. A slightly increased activity of acid phosphatases induced by HR can be supposed at best for the dose range of 5 to 7.5 Gy. If the dose is even more increased, the reverse effect found in the carbohydrate metabolism, too, and an increased activation of acid phosphatases in the control group will be observed. This unexpected reversion of the protective effect could be related to the assumed inhibitory effect of HR on the ATPases and thus on the anaerobic part of glycolysis or to a breakdown of the cell interaction system of endothelial cells, glia cells, and neurons.",Included

[Russian] Effects of gamma-radiation at a dose of 3 Gy against either antiorthostatic hypodynamia (AOH) or hypokinesia (HK) on formation of the differentiated motor-drinking reflex (DR) were compared. Each of the forms of motor deprivation hindered the elaboration of DR; gamma-irradiation aggravated these disorders. At the same time, AOH led to significantly more severe disturbances in the higher nervous activity including the generalized excitation, pathologic aggressiveness and neurotization of animals. In contrast, hypokinesia stimulated the active elements of behavior which inhibit the passive-defensive behavior and a fear reaction. Therefore, the modifying effect of irradiation becomes apparent only if combined with AOH.",Included

1872,"Diminished neuronal activity increases neuron-neuron connectivity underlying silent synapse formation and the rapid conversion of silent to functional synapses Neuronal activity regulates the synaptic strength of neuronal networks. However, it is still unclear how diminished activity changes connection patterns in neuronal circuits. To address this issue, we analyzed neuronal connectivity and relevant mechanisms using hippocampal cultures in which developmental synaptogenesis had occurred. We show that diminution of network activity in mature neuronal circuit promotes reorganization of neuronal circuits via NR2B subunit-containing NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NR2B-NMDARs), which mediate silent synapse formation. Simultaneous double whole-cell recordings revealed that diminishing neuronal circuit activity for 48 h increased the number of synaptically connected neuron pairs with both silent and functional synapses. This increase was accompanied by the specific expression of NR2B-NMDARs at synaptic sites. Analysis of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) showed that the frequency of NMDAR-mediated, but not AMPAR-mediated, mEPSCs increased, indicating that diminished neuronal activity promotes silent synapse formation via the surface delivering NR2B-NMDARs in mature neurons. After activation of neuronal circuit by releasing from TTX blockade (referred as circuit reactivation), the frequency of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs increased instead, and this increase was prevented by ifenprodil. The circuit reactivation also caused an increased colocalization of glutamate receptor 1-specfic and synaptic NR2B-specific puncta. These results indicate that the circuit reactivation converts rapidly silent synapses formed during activity suppression to functional synapses. These data may provide a new example of homeostatic circuit plasticity that entails the modulation of neuron-neuron connectivity by synaptic activity.",Excluded
3495,"Sensory neuron sodium current requires nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone during development Development of the embryonic nervous system requires thyroid hormone. However, the underlying mechanisms and targets of thyroid hormone action are not well defined. To identify embryonic roles for thyroid hormone we tested for effects on a key neuronal trait, voltage-gated sodium current (I(Na)), in the zebrafish model system. We recorded from Rohon-Beard sensory neurons (RBs) using whole cell voltage-clamp methods. Here, we provide in vivo evidence for thyroid hormone regulation of I(Na). Chronic thyroid hormone application increased RB peak I(Na) density 1.4-fold. However, I(Na) density showed a similar increase within 5 min of an acute hormone application, a time course not expected for a genomic mechanism. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), a thyroid hormone blocker, blocked both chronic and acute effects. Further, the thyroid hormone precursor thyroxine (T4) affected I(Na), yet the traditionally active form triiodothyronine did not. Consequently, we tested for a nonconventional T4 receptor. LM609, a selective antagonist of integrin alphaVbeta3, occluded the rapid effect of T4, implicating a specific integrin dimer as a T4 receptor. Chronic application of either tetrac or LM609 significantly reduced sodium conductance, demonstrating an in vivo requirement for T4-integrin regulation of I(Na). Further, removing endogenous T4 levels via yolkectomy reduced sodium conductance, an effect that was partially rescued by T4 supplementation following surgery. Because RBs mediate the embryonic touch response, we tested for behavioral effects. Tetrac and LM609 significantly reduced the percentage of touch trials eliciting a normal touch response. T4's rapid effect on RB I(Na) highlights the importance of embryonic T4 availability and nongenomic T4 signaling.",Excluded
3558,"Reduction in radiation during percutaneous lumbar pedicle screw placement using a new device OBJECTIVE: To assess a new intradermal locator device for percutaneous placement of lumbar pedicle screws.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were alternately assigned to two groups. The locator group underwent lumbar pedicle screw placement using the intradermal locator. The control group was aided by traditional fluoroscopy. Baseline demographics, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, operation time, intraoperative fluoroscopy time and guidewire insertion time were recorded. All postoperative CT scans were reviewed by an independent spine surgeon to grade screw placement accuracy.RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (180 screws) were assigned to the locator group and 30 patients (128 screws) to the control group. The locator device could significantly reduce the fluoroscopy time [3.9 sec (SD = 1.9) vs. 9.6 sec (SD = 5.8), p < 0.001] and guidewire insertion time [2.69 min (SD = 0.67) vs. 4.49 min (SD = 1.96), p < 0.001] compared with the conventional method for each pedicle screw. The whole operation time of the locator group was shorter than that of the control group [2-segment: 243.2 min (SD = 16.9) vs. 301.7 min (SD = 14.9), p < 0.001; 1-segment: 154.5 min (SD = 14.3) vs. 194.6 min (SD = 19.3), p < 0.001].

1494,"Extreme retinal remodeling triggered by light damage: implications for age related macular degeneration PURPOSE: Our objective was to comprehensively assess the nature and chronology of neural remodeling in retinal degenerations triggered by light-induced retinal damage (LIRD) in adult albino rodents. Our primary hypothesis is that all complete photoreceptor degenerations devolve to extensive remodeling. An hypothesis emergent from data analysis is that the LIRD model closely mimics late-stage atrophic age relared macular degeneration (AMD).METHODS: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats received intense light exposures of varied durations and survival times ranging from 0 to 240 days. Remodeling was visualized by computational molecular phenotyping (CMP) of a small molecule library: 4-aminobutyrate (gamma), arginine (R), aspartate (D), glutamate (E), glutamine (Q), glutathione (J), glycine (G), and taurine (tau). This library was augmented by probes for key proteins such as rod opsin, cone opsin and cellular retinal binding protein (CRALBP). Quantitative CMP was used to profile 160 eyes from 86 animals in over 6,000 sections.RESULTS: The onset of remodeling in LIRD retinas is rapid, with immediate signs of metabolic stress in photoreceptors, the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the choriocapillaris, and Muller cells. In particular, anomalous elevated aspartate levels appear to be an early stress marker in photoreceptors. After the stress phase, LIRD progresses to focal photoreceptor degeneration within 14 days and extensive remodeling by 60 days. RPE and choriocapillaris losses parallel Muller cell distal seal formation, with progressive neuronal migration, microneuroma evolution, fluid channel formation, and slow neuronal death. The remaining retina in advanced light damage can be classified as survivor, light damage (LD), or decimated zones where massive Muller cell and neuronal emigration into the choroid leaves a retina depleted of neurons and Muller cells. These zones and their transitions closely resemble human geographic atrophy. Across these zones, Muller cells manifest extreme changes in the definitive Muller cell tauQE signature, as well as CRALBP and arginine signals.CONCLUSIONS: LIRD retinas manifest remodeling patterns of genetic retinal degeneration models, but involve no developmental complexities, and are ultimately more aggressive, devastating the remaining neural retina. The decimation of the neural retina via cell emigration through the perforated retina-choroid interface is a serious denouement. If focal remodeling in LIRD accurately profiles late stage atrophic age-related macular degenerations, it augurs poorly for simple molecular interventions. Indeed, the LIRD profile in the SD rat manifests more similarities to advanced human atrophic AMD than most genetically or immunologically induced murine models of AMD.",Excluded

The presence of acoustic radiation may result in an unreal bone conduction threshold, promoting an unreal air/bone gap in the high frequencies.AIM: aim to analyze the acoustic radiation effect on the extension of air/bone gap at 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 Hz.MATERIALS AND METHOD: our clinical and experimental study had a sample of 101 individuals, who matched inclusion criteria: to have an air/bone gap higher than 10 dB in the frequencies of 2,000; 3,000 and 4,000 Hz. All of them had their bone conduction threshold measured in two conditions: open ear canal and closed ear canal.RESULTS: we found that major differences between the two conditions evaluated occurred at the 4,000 Hz; data analysis showed significant difference in the extension for the air/bone gap; analysis of the number of cases of mixed hearing loss that changed to sensorineural was significant too.CONCLUSION: These studies concluded that when the MAE is occluded, the acoustic radiation phenomenon is controlled or avoided, enabling bone measures at the frequencies of 3,000 and 4,000Hz to be more accurate.",Excluded
2766,"Comparison of Neutron Organ and Effective Dose Coefficients for PIMAL Stylized Phantoms in Bent Postures in Cranial and Caudal Irradiation Geometries ABSTRACT: Radiation dose estimations in the human body are performed using computational reference phantoms, which are anatomical representations of the human body. In previous studies, dose reconstructions have been performed focusing primarily on phantoms in an upright posture, which limits the accuracy of the dose estimations for postures observed in realistic work settings. In this work, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 103 recommendations for monoenergetic neutron plane sources directed downward from above the head (cranial) and upward from below the feet (caudal) for adult female and male reference phantoms were used to calculate organ absorbed and effective dose coefficients. The Phantom with Moving Arms and Legs (PIMAL) and the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) radiation transport code were used to compute organ-absorbed dose and effective dose coefficients for the upright, half-bent (45degree), and full-bent (90degree) phantom postures. The doses calculated for each of the articulated positions were compared to those calculated for the upright posture by computing the ratios of the coefficients (45degree/upright and 90degree/upright). These ratios were used to assess the effectiveness of upright phantoms in providing a comparable estimate when conducting dose estimations and dose reconstructions for articulated positions. This work compiling neutron cranial and caudal posture-specific dose coefficients completes the series of dose coefficients computed for posture-specific ICRP Publication 116 irradiation geometries for monoenergetic photons and neutrons, in addition to cranial and caudal monoenergetic photons. Results reported demonstrated that organ-absorbed dose coefficients for most of the organs in the CRA and CAU irradiation geometries were significantly higher for the bent phantoms than for the upright phantom. Since the upright phantom underestimates the organ-absorbed dose, this demonstrates the impact of posture while performing dose calculations. Organ doses reported in past neutron dose coefficient data were found to omit effects from neutron resonances at energies of 0.435, 1.0, and 3.21 MeV from 16O in tissue. Reported data notes as high as 60% underestimation for neutron organ-absorbed doses, specifically at the neutron resonance energy region omitted by smoothing. Ongoing studies are examining the effect of resonances on reported neutron organ-absorbed dose coefficients in ICRP 116 geometries.",Excluded

[Ukrainian] Small doses of radioactive irradiation were found to be associated with damage to all levels of the nervous system, as evidenced by cliniconeurological investigations. But regulatory functions and vascular system get it most of all. Commonly seen in the sample was vegetovascular dystonia, also revealed were a varying degree discirculatory encephalopathy, acute disturbances in cerebral circulation, dyscirculatory myelopathy. Vascular abnormalities may develop at any age but in young adulthood they tend to occur more frequently. Clinical manifestations of vegetovascular dystonia were characterized by profound mixed type vegetative crises. Even if treated, vegetovascular dystonia tends to acquire remittent-and-progredient course leading to decompensation very soon. Strokes run atypical course: hemorrhages occur more often than not; circulatory disorders come about against the background of normal arterial blood pressure or insignificant its fluctuations. Hemorrhage may run gradually progressing course, which fact makes their diagnosis very difficult even with modern techniques being involved in relevent studies. It is not infrequently that carotid angiography does not find any structural-and-morphologic changes in the main vessels. A separate nozologic form, viz. that of discirculatory encephalopacy due to radiative irradiation, is suggested, as an entity worth introducing into the medical nomenclature.",Included
672,"Total-body PET: Maximizing sensitivity to create new opportunities for clinical research and patient care PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article, we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET.

842,"Effects of spaceflight on ocular counterrolling and the spatial orientation of the vestibular system We recorded the horizontal (yaw), vertical (pitch), and torsional (roll) eye movements of two rhesus monkeys with scleral search coils before and after the COSMOS Biosatellite 2229 Flight. The aim was to determine effects of adaptation to microgravity on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The animals flew for 11 days. The first postflight tests were 22 h and 55 h after landing, and testing extended for 11 days after reentry. There were four significant effects of spaceflight on functions related to spatial orientation: (1) Compensatory ocular counterrolling (OCR) was reduced by about 70% for static and dynamic head tilts with regard to gravity. The reduction in OCR persisted in the two animals throughout postflight testing. (2) The gain of the torsional component of the angular VOR (roll VOR) was decreased by 15% and 50% in the two animals over the same period. (3) An up-down asymmetry of nystagmus, present in the two monkeys before flight was reduced after exposure to microgravity. (4) The spatial orientation of velocity storage was shifted in the one monkey that could be tested soon after flight. Before flight, the yaw axis eigenvector of optokinetic afternystagmus was close to gravity when the animal was upright or tilted. After flight, the yaw orientation vector was shifted toward the body yaw axis. By 7 days after recovery, it had reverted to a gravitational orientation. We postulate that spaceflight causes changes in the vestibular system which reflect adaptation of spatial orientation from a gravitational to a body frame of reference. These changes are likely to play a role in the postural, locomotor, and gaze instability demonstrated on reentry after spaceflight.",Included
1137,"Artificial Intelligence is implemented as a tool in the daily workflow on the PET/MRI scanner to create an attenuation map for the correct PET image Introduction: Artificial Intelligence is implemented as a tool in the daily workflow on the PET/MRI scanner to create an attenuation map for the correct PET image. Background(s): A PET/MRI Siemens Biograph mMRI was installed in 2011 and used in the daily routine primarily for dementia patients. The PET/MRI is challenged by lack of a direct measure of photon attenuation correction (AC), for obtaining a correct PET image. The patients previously needed to have a low-dose CT-AC. Ladefoged et al. developed an application based on deep learning model to generate artificial CT images from MR images. The model was trained on more than 1000 patients with both MRI and CT scans. The deep learning model takes images for attenuation correction in reconstructing positron emission tomography (PET/MRI). Since May 2019 Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based MRI-AC has been implemented as a part of the daily workflow. The objective of this study was to share our experiences of the use of AI MRI-AC in clinical practice. Method(s): All patients for dementia evaluation are injected with 200 MBq [18F] FDG, rest for 30 min and imaged with PET/MRI in a protocol consisting of a 10 min single-bed acquisition. The Dixon umap is centered on the brain stem and MRI sequences are focused on structural and vascular pathology. As soon as the Dixon sequence is ready it is sent to a computer node. The AI-method will generate and return a new AC map to be used during reconstruction for the correct attenuated PET image in less than 1 min. AI generated umaps are inspected before use by technologists and accuracy is followed weekly by comparing to a CT based reference. Result(s): Implementing AI in the daily routine for dementia patients on a PET/MRI scanner results in images that are ready to be viewed and described as soon as the patient leaves the scanner. The patients have no need for a CT scan, which saves the patients from extra radiation dose, and saves the staff some challenging time due to handling the immobile dementia patients. Conclusion(s): AI models, if validated for performance, offer several potential benefits to patients as well as technologists. One-stop PET/MRI for dementia patients is quick and together with the AI it is a robust and cost-effective technique for the health care system.",Excluded

To evaluate changes of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in irradiated brain metastases arterial spin-labeling techniques (ASL) were applied and compared to the outcome of (1)H MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging ((1)H MRS, SI).PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2 patients follow-up examinations of irradiated brain metastases were performed on a 1.5-T tomograph (average single dose: 20 Gy/80% isodose). Relative CBF values of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM),and metastases (Met) were measured by means of the ASL techniques ITS-FAIR and Q2TIPS. (1)H MRS was performed with PRESS 1500/135.RESULTS: In both patients with initially hyperperfused metastases (Met/GM >1) the reduction of rCBF after stereotactic radiosurgery indicated response to treatment--even if the contrast-enhancing region increased--while increasing rCBF values indicated tumor progression. The findings were confirmed by (1)H MRS, SI and subsequent follow-up.CONCLUSION: The ASL techniques ITS-FAIR and Q2TIPS are able to monitor changes of rCBF in irradiated brain metastases.

1524,"Significant reduction of beta-amyloid in the CNS following external radiation: Implications for treatment in alzheimer's disease Purpose/Objective(s): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent form of dementia in the elderly population, is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau protein tangles. These events are especially prevalent in the hippocampus region which is responsible for long term memory. In this animal study, we investigated if cranial X-irradiation could reduce the formation of Ab plaques as a potential novel clinical treatment for Alzheimer's disease, the rationale being that external beam radiotherapy has been used previously as an effective clinical treatment for systemic amyloidosis. Materials/Methods: A transgenic mouse model was used that expresses a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) both directed to CNS neurons. Both mutations are associated with early-onset AD. Radiation treatments were either a single dose (5 Gy, 10 Gy or 15 Gy) or daily fractionation (1 Gy, 2 Gy) to a dose of 10 Gy to a single side of the head. Brains were harvested at various times post-irradiation (2-8 wks) and coronal sections were evaluated for H&E and antibody specific immunohistochemistry to detect beta-amyloid plaques and assess radiation response, staining for IL1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, microglia cells (CD11b) and activated microglia cells (CD68). Result(s): Radiation treatments were well-tolerated. H&E stained tissue sections indicated no evidence of a significant decrease in cell density (Nissl staining) and no compelling evidence of significant cellular necrosis. No signs of devitalization, malacia or spongiosus or classic acute or chronic inflammatory features were evident. The number and size of beta-amyloid plaques were compared between the irradiated and shielded halves of the brain. The average number of plaques in the unirradiated brain increased with age, the values for 32, 34 and 38 week old animals were 43.9 (SD +/- 17.6; n = 9), 61.7 (SD +/- 19.8, n = 9) and 109 (SD +/- 26.9, n = 9) respectively. Radiation treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction of plaques throughout the brain (paired t-test p = 0.002).This effect was more significant in the hippocampus region (p = 0.0004). At 4 weeks post-treatment 5, 10 and 15 Gy caused a 71 +/- 3%, 87 +/- 24%, 92 +/- 34% reduction in plaque incidence in the hippocampus. The greatest reductions were noted at longer times post-treatment. TGF-beta staining was restricted to the irradiated side of the brain, little or no site-specific staining of IL1 or TNF-alpha was seen. A trend was evident of activated microglia in the irradiated brain. Conclusion(s): We report the first experience that external beam irradiation can produce a significant reduction in beta-amyloid plaques associated with AD.",Excluded

2709,"Connecting radiotherapy with targeted anti-glioma therapy using superparamagnetic nanoparticles conjugated with granzyme B INTRODUCTION: 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is overexpressed on the membrane of the glioblastoma cells, but not on corresponding normal cells. Membrane-bound Hsp70 (i.e., mHsp70) is rapidly internalized into tumor cells and thus targeting the protein might provide a promising strategy for theranostics. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are contrast negative agents that are used for the detection of tumors with MRI. In the presented study we conjugated the protease Granzyme B which is known to recognize mHsp70 to superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles to assess tumor-specific theranostic targeting before and after radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles covered with Granzyme B protease (GrB-SPIONs) were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, NMR relaxometry. Cellular interactions of the GrB-SPIONs conjugates with tumor cell lines (i.e., U87, LN229, C6, K562, HeLa) were assessed using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and TEM. Brain tumor targeting was analyzed in the orthotopic C6 glioma model in rats, human U87 and LN229 gliomas in nu/nu mice. Following intravenous administration retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor site was assessed using high-field 11.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with subsequent histological assay. Biodistribution studies of the SPIONs were performed by NLR-M2 measurements. Combination of the nanoparticle targeting with radiotherapy of the brain tumors was performed at small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) (Xstrahl Inc., UK) using single of fractionated irradiation. RESULT(S): In vitro experiments demonstrated the selectivity of GrB-SPIONs conjugates to free and mHsp70 in different tumor cell types in a dose-dependent manner. High-resolution MRI on T2-weighted images showed the retention of the conjugates in C6 glioma model in rats, and U87 and LN229 human orthotopic glioma models in nu/nu mice. Accumulation of GrB-SPION nanoparticles in the glioma resulted in many-fold drop of T2-values in comparison to non-conjugated SPIONs. Biodistribution analysis using NLR-M2 measurements showed an increase in the tumor-to-background (normal brain) uptake ratio of GrB-SPIONs conjugates in glioma-bearing animals in comparison to SPIONs. Accumulation within Hsp70-positive glioma was enhanced after a single dose (10 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Combination of the radiotherapy and application of the GrB-SPIONs significantly increased the survival of the glioma-bearing animals. CONCLUSION(S): Elevated accumulation of the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles in the tumor due to radiosensitization proves the combination of radiotherapy and application of Hsp70-targeted agents such as Granzyme B in the theranostics of brain tumors.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: We reviewed records of metastatic melanoma patients receiving ipilimumab 3mg/kg between 2010-2014. RRs, measured by immune RECIST criteria, and toxicity were compared by Fischer's exact text. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method. Result(s): 61 patients received ipilimumab, with 35 (57.4%) also receiving radiation within 4 months of ipilimumab. The radiation cohort was similar at baseline except for greater systemic burden of disease (82.9% vs. 42.3%, p = 0.005), higher dexamethasone use (14.3% vs. 0%, p = 0.048), and more brain involvement (74.3% vs. 0% p<0.001). 92.3% of brain metastases received SRS. Grade 3 toxicity was not statistically different between cohorts (5.9% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.113); one grade 4 was experienced (1.6%), while no grade 5 occurred. While the ipilimumab alone group demonstrated a trend toward higher 1-year OS (49.4% vs. 73.2%, p = 0.090), the cohort did not have any patients with brain metastases; therefore, comparing only patients with extra-cranial metastases, 1-year OS was similar (76.2% vs. 73.2%, p = 0.587). RR between both cohorts was similar (20.0% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.494). Pre-ipilimumab absolute lymphocyte count greater than 1000 was the only significant predictor for increased RR in multivariable analysis (Odds Ratio: 8.56, 95% CI: 1.82-40.42; p = 0.007). Comparing 2-5 fractions of radiation to ipilimumab alone demonstrated a trend towards higher response rate (42.9% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.074). Conclusion(s): Despite poorer prognostic characteristics in the RT with ipilimumab cohort, toxicity, RR and OS were similar between the arms. Prospective studies investigating the ideal radiation fractionation to improve ipilimumab response rates are warranted. ALC < 1000 should be considered an exclusion criteria for these trials.",Excluded

The extreme radiosensitivity of the photoreceptor cells was underlined by the continued manifestation of fine structural changes and cell death up to 6 months post-radiation in animals receiving doses above 500 cGy. The retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were more radioresistant than photoreceptors and RPE cell loss was only observed at doses of more than 1500 cGy. One year after irradiation with 1500 cGy the retinal vasculature showed capillary occlusion with some evidence of recanalisation. Telangiectasia was observed in the large retinal veins. Although the inner retinal neurones and glial cells showed no evidence of direct radiation damage, the nerve fibre layer adjacent to occluded retinal vessels demonstrated ultrastructural evidence of ischaemic neuropathy and retinal oedema. At doses above 1500 cGy the choriocapillaris showed platelet aggregation and capillary loss.",Included
1591,"Effects of combined immune and radiation cancer therapy on inflammatory environment in the brain of a mouse model Purpose/Objective(s): Cancer patients often report behavioral and cognitive changes following cancer treatment. These can include difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and increased anxiety. Though changes are often associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or cranial irradiation, these effects are also seen in patients who receive peripheral but no cranial irradiation and no chemotherapy. A proinflammatory environment in the brain may mediate these effects. Neuroinflammation mediates cognitive impairments in other neurological disorders. Its role in cancer-related neurological dysfunction is likely relevant given novel treatments combining peripheral radiotherapy (RT) with immune activation. However, little is known about how these treatments might affect the brain, in individuals with or without tumors. Our preliminary research has identified an association between treatments combining immune activation and RT and impairments in cognitive measures. Here, we investigate the role of neuroinflammation in these effects. We hypothesize that cognitive impairments following treatment with immunotherapy and RT will be associated with increased expression of neuromodulatory inflammatory cytokines. Materials/Methods: Our project utilizes anti-CTLA4 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy preceding precision CT-guided peripheral RT to closely model clinical treatment. C57BL/6J mice with or without injected hind flank 3LL lung carcinoma were used. Mice received sham, RT-only, anti-CTLA4-only, or RT+anti-CTLA4 treatment. Mice were exposed to two identical objects and 24 hours later reintroduced to one familiar object and one novel object. Mice that recognize the familiar object will spend more time exploring the novel object. The percent time exploring the novel object out of the total time exploring both objects is calculated to determine object recognition. Following cognitive testing, brain tissue was harvested and used in an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 20-plex (GM-CSF, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-1b, IL-4, MIG, KC, VEGF, IL-17, MIP-1a, IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, IL-5, FGF-Basic, IL-1a, IFN-g, IL-13, MCP-1, and IP-10). Result(s): In the animals that did not receive tumors, object recognition was seen in control mice and mice receiving either RT or anti-CTLA-4 alone, but not in mice receiving both treatments. In mice receiving tumors, only the mice that received RT alone showed novel object recognition. Conclusion(s): While combining immune activation and RT optimizes tumor control, it is associated with cognitive impairments. Data from 20-plex are currently being analyzed. We will determine how levels of cytokines and chemokines might be altered by the various treatments and whether they are associated with behavioral and cognitive performance. These results will be presented at the meeting.",Included

891,"Effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of primary motor cortex on laser-evoked potentials in migraine The aim of this study was to examine the effects of high-frequency (HF) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left primary motor cortex (M1) on subjective pain and evoked responses induced by laser stimulation (LEPs) of the contralateral hand and supraorbital zone in a cohort of migraine patients without aura during the inter-critical phase, and to compare the effects with those of non-migraine healthy controls. Thirteen migraine patients and 12 sex- and age-matched controls were evaluated. Each rTMS session consisted of 1,800 stimuli at a frequency of 5 Hz and 90% motor threshold intensity. Sham (control) rTMS was performed at the same stimulation position. The vertex LEP amplitude was reduced at the trigeminal and hand levels in the sham-placebo condition and after rTMS to a greater extent in the migraine patients than in healthy controls, while the laser pain rating was unaffected. These results suggest that HF rTMS of motor cortex and the sham procedure can both modulate pain-related evoked responses in migraine patients.",Excluded
3270,"The capabilities and characteristics of helical tomotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy in sparing the hippocampus during prophylactic cranial irradiation Purpose: To investigate the capabilities and characteristics of helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in sparing the Bilateral hippocampal tissues (BHT) during prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Method(s): HT and VMAT treatment plans were generated with a prescription dose of 30Gy/10 fractions in 16 patients treated with PCI. The dosimetry parameters of BHT, organs at risk (OARs), and planning target volume (PTV) were determined when the average dose of BHT was reduced by about 4Gy to serve as an observation point. Statistical plots were used to present dosimetry changing trends when sparing the BHT with both HT and VMAT technologies. Result(s): HT plans spared BHT V7.3Gy by up to 40%, with the average Dmean-BHT = 8.42+/-0.41Gy, while VMAT plans failed to spare BHT V7.3Gy by such an amount. HT authored significantly lower doses to OARs, including Dmean-BHT (HT 16.37Gy vs. VMAT 17.81Gy, P=0.03), Dmean-inner ear (P=0.02), Dmean-parotid glands (P=0.02), Dmax-lens (P=0.02), and Dmax-brainstem (P=0.02), except for Dmax-optic nerves (P=0.87), compared to VMAT. Also, compared to VMAT, HT plans provided better target coverage, with lower average D2% (P=0.02), higher average D98% (P=0.02), and better conformal index (0.87 vs. 0.84, P=0.02) and homogeneity index (0.15 vs. 0.21, P=0.05). With smaller BHT doses, the dose distribution to PTV occurred in three dosimetry regions for both HT and VMAT plans; the plateau region (>20.0Gy for HT vs >16.0Gy for VMAT), gradient region (20.0-12.0Gy vs 16.0-11.0Gy), and falling region (<12.0Gy vs <11.0Gy). The average delivery duration for HT was determined at almost 7.7 times longer than VMAT. Conclusion(s): Compared to VMAT, HT was better at sparing the BHT and OARs and had better target coverage but much longer treatment duration. More BHT dose decreases would yield worse target dose coverage, which would present a 'three regions' stair-stepping characteristic.",Excluded
858,"Use of human mesenchymal stem cell treatment to prevent anhedonia in a rat model of traumatic brain injury PURPOSE: Major depression and related mood disorders are the most common long-term outcomes associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Given the potentially debilitating consequences of depression, and the fact that TBI patients are frequently refractory to antidepressant drugs, new therapies are clearly needed. We hypothesized that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), delivered intravenously, can effectively treat TBI-induced depression and other behavioral deficits associated with TBI.METHODS: Rats (n = 8 per group) were subjected to experimental TBI or control sham operation. Six hours post TBI, rats were treated with 1x106 hMSC or vehicle control. Immediately after TBI and prior to hMSC or control treatment, rats were subjected to either targeted precision x-ray irradiation to eliminate subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation or sham irradiation. One week after TBI, SVZ irradiation, and hMSC treatment, rats were evaluated for the depression-like behavior, anhedonia, using the two-bottle saccharin preference paradigm; and for working memory using the novel object recognition test.RESULTS: TBI resulted in a 54% (p<=0.05) decrease in saccharin preference scores while treatment of TBI with hMSC fully prevented this anhedonic behavior. TBI was also found to produce a 73% (p<=0.05) decrease in novel object interaction time, indicating impaired working memory, and was similarly improved by treatment with hMSC. The ability of hMSC to prevent TBI-associated depression and working memory impairment was eliminated when SVZ proliferation was inhibited by irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: This work has identified a possible role for hMSC in the treatment of TBI-induced depression and other behaviors and suggests a mechanistic role for proliferative cells of the SVZ proliferation in hMSC efficacy.",Excluded
1905,"Optimal timing and clinical value of radiotherapy in advanced ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer with or without baseline brain metastases: implications from pattern of failure analyses BACKGROUND: Despite development of several next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib remains one of the first-line treatment options for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and is widely used in situations where next-generation TKIs aren't yet approved or economically inaccessible. However, the pattern of failure and clinical value of radiotherapy in metastatic crizotinib-treated ALK-mutant lung cancer, with or without baseline brain metastases (BBM), are largely unknown.METHODS: Consecutive crizotinib-treated NSCLC patients with adequate imaging and measurable disease were retrospectively enrolled. Disease progression in original sites (primary/metastatic), new sites, or both, are classified as original failure (OF), distant failure (DF) and ODF, respectively. Progression free survival, from crizotinib initiation to the first disease progression, and from that to the second disease progression, were calculated as PFS1 and PFS2.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified. With a median follow up of 22.0 (range, 2.0-72.0) months, 52 patients had crizotinib-treatment failure. The frequencies of OF, ODF, and DF, were 50.0, 26.9, and 23.1%, respectively. Histology, primary tumor size and presence of BBM, were independently associated with OF, using competing risks analyses. The brain was the most common site of initial disease progression. Patients with BBM had a significant higher possibility developing multiple-progressive lesions in the brain (p = 0.002). Importantly, four of the ten patients who had baseline oligo-metastatic cranial disease but didn't receive upfront brain radiation, developed multiple-progressive disease in the brain. Brain radiation before crizotinib could alter the disease failure patterns and improve PFS1 among patients with BBM (p = 0.006). Extracranial radiation was efficient in controlling symptoms but it was not associated with PFS1 (p = 0.223), and the majority of patients were eligible for salvage radiotherapy upon disease progression to crizotinib. By the time of data cut-off, 28 patients had second disease progression, with a median PFS2 of 7.0 (95% CI 5.4-8.6) months and salvage radiotherapy significantly prolonged PFS2 (p = 0.003). Additionally, patients receiving any radiotherapy during their treatment course had a significant longer overall survival (p = 0.048).CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with baseline oligo-metastatic brain lesions which are suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery, upfront brain radiotherapy provides considerable clinical benefits. While, extracranial radiation may be deferred in asymptomatic patients with multiple-metastatic lesions.",Excluded
1362,"Androstenes mediated oncophagy of glial and myeloid tumor cells by different mechanisms Cellular death by necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy can be considered as one of host resistance processes. We reported that beta androstene hormones, Dehydroepiandrosterone, Androstenediol and Androstenetriol, up regulate host resistance against lethal infections by bacteria, viruses and restore host myelopoiesis after whole body radiation exposures. In contrast, the a androstenediol (17alphaAED) epimer, mediates host resistance by oncophagy of myeloid, epithelial and brain tumor cells by either apoptotic or autophagy mechanisms. In myeloid tumor cell, 17alphaAED induces apoptosis as shown by TUNEL assay and electron microscopy. 17alphaAED inhibits DNA synthesis in myelocytic leukemia cells whereas 17alphaAED does not. Similarly, l7alphaAED inhibited the proliferation of estrogen receptor positive or negative human mammary carcinomas, but its activity is independent of either estrogen or androgen receptors. 17alphaAED also inhibits proliferation and induces cell death of multiple, unrelated glioma with an IC50 of 8 to 25 ?M. Treatment with 17alphaAED induced autophagosomes and acidic vesicular organelles formation in human malignant glioma. The position of the hydroxyl group on C-17 dictates the anti-tumor activity of the androstenes and must be in the a-configuration, demonstrating a strict structure-activity relationship. Exposure of U937 lymphoma cells to 17alphaAED induces apoptosis without the activation of the autophagic process as determined by the elevated levels of caspase 3 cleavage and PARP processing. In contrast beclin-1 and conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II were evident in T98G glioblastoma cells treated with 17alphaAED. In human glioblastoma 17alphaAED autophagy is induced by PERK/eIF2 signaling mediated ER stress. These findings reveal that the same agent 17alphaAED induces oncophagy in different tumor cells: autophagy in human glioblastoma and apoptosis in human myelocytic leukemia. The target cell determines the oncophagic pathway used.",Excluded
2664,"Brain dysplasia evoked by gamma irradiation at different stages of prenatal development leads to different tonic and clonic seizure reactivity Rats with brain dysplasia evoked by interruption of different stages of prenatal neurogenesis show characteristic variations in susceptibility to seizures depending on the neurochemical specificity of pharmacological agents used to evoke seizures. To verify a discrepancy between the data obtained using different pharmacological models, neurochemically neutral electroshocks were applied here. To produce brain dysplasia of different degrees, pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to a single 1.0. Gy dose of gamma rays on gestation days 13, 15, 17 or 19. From the postnatal day 60, their male offspring (E13s, E15s, E17s and E19s, respectively) were subjected to 21 daily electrical stimulations to evoke seizures. Profiles of tonic and clonic reactivity to electrical stimulation significantly differed from those observed following pilocarpine or kainic acid administration. E17s showed minimal intensity of tonic but maximal of clonic responses. On the contrary, very high tonic and low clonic reactivity was observed in E13s and E15s. Periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNHs) were observed exclusively in E15s and E17s. Generally, the size of PNHs was correlated positively with susceptibility to tonic seizures but negatively with susceptibility to clonic seizures. Analogous correlations with the size of the neocortex were opposite. E13s and E19s had brains devoid PNHs but showed high tonic seizure susceptibility similar to that in E15s. It can therefore be concluded that PNHs modified the type of seizure reactivity from tonic to clonic, depending of their size, but the presence of PNHs was not necessary for the development of seizure susceptibility itself. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

Therefore, they and other physicians, including dermatologists, often do not recognize such skin injuries as being related to an interventional procedure. [References: 23]",Excluded
2730,"Radiosurgical Lesionectomy For Cavernomas Associated With Drug Resistant Epilepsy Purpose/Objective(s): Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain which cause hemorrhage and repetitive neurological deficits but the most frequent presenting symptom is epilepsy and is due to deposition of iron and blood products at the margin of the lesion. Microsurgical excision is preferred for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of SRS in seizure cessation for drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs. Materials/Methods: This retrospective single center study where in 11 patients with cortical or subcortical CMs located in highly functional areas with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these SRS procedures was 6yrs (+/-2.4) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 5 /month (+/-12). The mean marginal radiation dose was 18.5 Gy. Result(s): At median follow-up of 38mo, 54% were seizure free (Engel's class I), including 5 in class IA and 1 of the patients with occasional auras. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for 27% pts (class IIB). The remaining 19% patients showed little or no improvement. Outcomes were better for patients with simple partial seizures than for those with complex partial seizures. Location in the mesio-temporal region was associated with a poor outcome (2 of 11 patients), whereas location in the latero-temporal region was associated with a good outcome (5 of 11 patients). Location in the central region was also associated with an excellent outcome. Radiologically, 6 patients presented major reactional edema during the first year after SRS. In 2 of these patients, neuroradiological alterations were associated with clinical manifestations which included severe hemiparesis and speech impairment, but both patients fully recovered during the follow-up period with steroids. Post reactional edema correlates well with the response to the therapy. Conclusion(s): While radiosurgery role in controlling the bleeding in CM is controversial, it is a promising modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome.

2655,"Dental therapy before and after radiotherapy--an evaluation on patients with head and neck malignancies The present investigation evaluates the dental care situation of patients with head and neck cancer before and after radiotherapy. The situations of these patients in 1993 and 2005 were compared to detect similarities, differences and developments. In the years 1993 and 2005, 37 and 36 patients, respectively, with head and neck cancer treated by the local departments of otorhinolaryngology and of radiotherapy were examined consecutively according to their aftercare appointments. Time points of radiotherapy treatment of the patients evaluated in 1993 varied from 1984 to 1993. The patients evaluated in 2005 had received radiotherapy between 1998 and 2005. Therefore the applied radiotherapeutic regimen differed not only between the two groups of patients, but also within each group. The information for these investigations was provided anonymously. It was evaluated with descriptive statistics. The evaluation of the data shows distinct differences with respect to preventive and therapeutic dental care measures. In 2005, 35 out of 36 patients (97.2%) had a dental consultation before radiotherapy (1993, 65%). All 27 dentate patients (100%) obtained a splint for fluoride application (1993, none). 29% fewer edentulous patients were seen than in 1993. The number of teeth destroyed decreased from 19.2% (1993) to 7.8% in 2005. Mycoses due to Candida spp. and chronic failures in wound healing were rare (5.5%). In the course of the 12 years, prophylactic measures, such as the application of splints for fluoride treatment, were intensified. However, concepts for the dental care of patients undergoing radiotherapy, especially following the radiation, should be widened to avoid ruined teeth and long delayed wound healings.",Excluded

3122,"Cerebromicrovascular dysfunction predicts cognitive decline and gait abnormalities in a mouse model of whole brain irradiation-induced accelerated brain senescence Whole brain irradiation (WBI) is a mainstream therapy for patients with both identifiable brain metastases and prophylaxis for microscopic malignancies. However, it also promotes accelerated senescence in healthy tissues and leads to progressive cognitive dysfunction in up to 50% of tumor patients surviving long term after treatment, due to gamma-irradiation-induced cerebromicrovascular injury. Moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) via neuronal activity-dependent cerebromicrovascular dilation (functional hyperemia) has a critical role in maintenance of healthy cognitive function. To determine whether cognitive decline induced by WBI associates with impaired cerebromicrovascular function, C56BL/6 mice (3 months) subjected to a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI (5 Gy twice weekly for 4 weeks) and control mice were compared. Mice were tested for spatial memory performance (radial arm water maze), sensorimotor coordination (computerized gait analysis, CatWalk), and cerebromicrovascular function (whisker-stimulation-induced increases in CBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry) at 3 to 6 months post-irradiation. We found that mice with WBI exhibited impaired cerebromicrovascular function at 3 months post-irradiation, which was associated with impaired performance in the radial arm water maze. At 6 months, post-irradiation progressive impairment in gait coordination (including changes in the regularity index and phase dispersion) was also evident. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for early and persisting neurovascular impairment after a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI, which predict early manifestations of cognitive impairment.",Included

The risk for these adverse events after therapy is uncertain. In this study, the authors examined the size and significance of the observed association between occurrences of secondary cancers 5 years after radiotherapy in a large population of men with incident prostate cancer.METHODS: Men with incident prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and were distinguished by the type of treatment received, tumor stage, tumor grade, and age at diagnosis. SEER data also were used to identify occurrences of secondary cancer beginning 5 years after the date patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds of the subsequent occurrence of other cancers associated with types of radiation therapy received and was adjusted for the type of surgery, tumor grade, stage, and patient age.RESULTS: Compared with men who received no prostate cancer-directed radiation, men who received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as their only form of radiation therapy had statistically significant increased odds of developing secondary cancers at several sites potentially related to radiation therapy, including the bladder (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.44-1.84) and rectum (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.29-1.99). Men who received EBRT also had statistically significant higher odds of developing secondary cancers at sites in the upper body and other areas not potentially related to radiation therapy, including the cecum (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70), transverse colon (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30-2.63), brain (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22-2.75), stomach (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75), melanoma (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53), and lung and bronchus (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) compared with the odds among men who received no radiation therapy. Men who received radiation therapy in the form of radioactive implants or isotopes, either in isolation or combined with beam radiation, did not have significantly different odds of secondary cancer occurring at any of the 20 most common sites.CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received with EBRT had significantly higher odds of developing second cancers both overall and in the areas that were exposed to radiation. It is noteworthy that, to the authors' knowledge, this report shows for the first time that, despite the higher doses of radiation delivered, patients who received radioactive implants had the lowest odds of developing second cancers.",Included
2074,"The contribution of DNA and chromosome repair deficiencies to the radiosensitivity of ataxia-telangiectasia Cells derived from individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased chromosome aberrations at mitosis when compared with normal cell lines. Our previous studies showed that, despite similar initial levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), AT cells express higher initial chromosome damage than do normal cells as demonstrated by the technique of premature chromosome condensation. However, this finding accounted for only a portion of the increased sensitivity (T. K. Pandita and W. N. Hittelman, Radiat. Res. 130, 94-103, 1992). The purpose of the study reported here was to examine the contribution of DNA and chromosome repair to the radiosensitivity of AT cells. Exponentially growing AT and normal lymphoblastoid cells were fractionated into cell cycle phase-enriched populations by centrifugal elutriation, and their DNA and chromosome repair characteristics were evaluated by DNA neutral filter elution (for DNA DSBs) and by premature chromosome condensation, respectively. AT cells exhibited a reduced fast-repair component in both G1- and G2-phase cells, as observed at the level of both DNA DSBs and the chromosome; however, S-phase cells showed nearly normal DNA DSB repair. The findings that AT cells exhibit an increased level of chromosome damage and a deficiency in the fast component (but not the slow component) of repair suggest that chromatin organization might play a major role in the observed sensitivity of AT cells. When survival was plotted as a function of the residual amount of chromosome damage in G1- and G2- phase cells after 90 min of repair, the curves for normal and AT cells approached each other but did not overlap. These results suggest that, although higher initial levels of chromosome damage and reduced chromosome repair capability can explain much of the radiosensitivity of AT cells, other differences in AT cells must also contribute to their sensitivity phenotype.",Included

Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with LS-SCLC treated within our network between 2009 and 2020 who responded to initial therapy were stratified by receipt of PCI and stage of disease. A propensity score match analysis was carried out for stage II-III patients. Overall and neurological survival were defined as time to death and presumed death due to uncontrolled intracranial disease, respectively. Brain metastasis-free survival and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival were defined as freedom from intracranial progression and symptomatic intracranial progression, respectively. The effect of PCI on these outcomes was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Result(s): In total, 243 (69.6%) of 349 patients received PCI. On multivariate analysis in the propensity matched stage II-III cohort, PCI was a significant predictor of improved neurological survival (hazard ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.65; P = 0.01), brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.51; P < 0.01) and symptomatic brain metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.55; P < 0.01), but not improved overall survival. Two-year neurological survival estimates within the propensity matched cohort were 96.8% (95% confidence interval 87.6-99.2%) with PCI and 77.2% (95% confidence interval 63.0-86.4%) without PCI and 1- and 2-year estimates of incidence of brain metastases were 3.9% (95% confidence interval 1.3-11.7%) and 11.7% (95% confidence interval 5.6-23.5%) in the PCI group and 31.6% (95% confidence interval 22.1-43.9%) and 40.4% (95% confidence interval 29.2-54.0%) in the no PCI group, respectively. Conclusion(s): In the modern era of magnetic resonance imaging screening, PCI was associated with reduced incidence of intracranial progression in patients with stage II-III LS-SCLC who respond to initial therapy. This, importantly, translated to a decreased risk of neurological death within our propensity matched cohort, without significant improvement in overall survival.

72,"Activation of long-term synaptic plasticity causes suppression of epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices Electrical stimulation of cerebral targets for the treatment of epilepsy is an area under active investigation. Recent studies have shown that chronic stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, fornix, or hippocampus may be effective in attenuating seizure frequency in animal models and in patients with intractable epilepsy. However, many questions exist, such as what are the specific electrical parameters, target sites, and mechanisms, etc., which should be investigated in animal studies before considering the routine use of chronic stimulation in epileptic patients. It is also important to understand what happens to neural activity during repetitive pulse stimulation as well as after stimulation. To this end, we hypothesized: (1) activation of synaptic plasticity suppresses epileptiform activity and (2) low frequency stimulation is an effective stimulation protocol for reducing seizure intensity and frequency. We used rat hippocampal brain slices to study how electrical stimulation affects spontaneous and evoked epileptiform activity. Further, we compared low (1 Hz) versus high (100 Hz) frequency stimulation in the same preparation. We found that orthodromic stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals for 10 min reduces the amplitude of normal responses and diminishes epileptiform activity. The onset of suppression by 1 Hz stimulation was gradual, but persistent, whereas the onset of suppression by 100 Hz was rapid; however, the effects of 100 Hz stimulation were transient. Finally, the NMDA antagonist, AP5 reversed the antiepileptic effects achieved by 1 Hz stimulation. Collectively, these data suggest that using different stimulation parameters prolonged electrical stimulation in the hippocampus may be effective in reducing seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy and that suppression by low frequency stimulation may be mediated by long-term depression (LTD).",Excluded

The mean latency times for the development of myelopathy after irradiation with the thermal neutron beam-alone, or in combination with BPA or BSH, were 23.7 +/- 0.3, 21.8 +/- 0.4 and 19.6 +/- 0.4 weeks, respectively. The radiation-induced lesion in the spinal cord was characterised by white matter necrosis. Due to the variations in the microdistribution of different neutron capture agents in body tissues, it was considered inappropriate to define the biological effectiveness of the high LET radiation, resulting from the <sup>10</sup>B(n,alpha)<sup>7</sup>Li neutron capture reaction, relative to photon radiation, using the term 'relative biological effectiveness' (RBE). The term 'compound biological effectiveness' (CBE) factor was used as an alternative.

Expressed as total physical absorbed doses these values were 13.6 +/- 0.4, 30.3 +/- 2.7 and 13.8 +/- 0.5 Gy after irradiation with the thermal neutron beam alone, or the thermal neutron beam in combination with BSH or BPA, respectively. The RBE of the thermal neutron beam was 1.4 +/- 0.04. The microdistribution of the two neutron capture agents played a crucial role in the determination of the overall biological effect, after thermal neutron activation. BSH, which is excluded from the CNS parenchyma by the blood brain barrier, had a low CBE factor value of 0.46 +/- 0.5.

657,"Upregulation of Connexin-43 is Critical for Irradiation-induced Neuroinflammation BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is widely used for the treatment of pituitary adenomas. Unfortunately, it might raise the risk of ischemic stroke, with neuroinflammation being a major pathological process. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system and have been reported for playing important roles in ischemic stroke.OBJECTIVE: Here we studied how gamma-radiation would introduce astrocytes into a detrimental state for neuroinflammation and provide new theory evidence and target for the clinical management of inflammation- related neural damage after radiation-induced ischemic stroke.METHOD: HA-1800 cells were treated with gamma-radiation and then the protein and mRNA levels of Connexin (Cx)-43 were evaluated by western and q-PCR. The culture supernatant was collected and the concentrations of the inflammatory factors were determined by ELISA. MiRNA complementary to Cx-43 was designed through the online tools.RESULTS: Cx-43 is upregulated in the treatment of gamma-radiation in astrocytes and gamma-radiation introduced the detrimental function of astrocytes: cell viability was reduced while the apoptotic cells were increased. Inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-6, interleukin 1-beta were dramatically up-regulated by the irradiation. MiR-374a rescued irradiation induced Cx-43 up-regulation of astrocytes and eliminated detrimental function triggered by gamma-radiation.CONCLUSION: Cx-43 expression level may play an important role in the inflammation-related neural damage after irradiation-induced ischemic stroke.",Included
1620,"Whole-brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery in brain metastases: what is the evidence? The overall local treatment paradigm of brain metastases, which includes whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), continues to evolve. Local therapies play an important role in the management of brain metastases. The choice of local therapy depends on factors that involve the patient (performance status, expected survival, and age), the prior treatment history, and the tumor (type and subtype, number, size, location of metastases, and extracranial disease status). Multidisciplinary collaboration is required to facilitate an individualized plan to improve the outcome of disease in patients with this life-limiting complication. There has been concern about the neurocognitive effects of WBRT. A number of approaches that mitigate cognitive dysfunction, such as pharmacologic intervention (memantine) or a hippocampal-sparing strategy, have been studied in a prospective manner with WBRT. Although there has been an increase in the use of SRS in the management of brain metastases in recent years, WBRT retains an important therapeutic role.",Excluded

933,"Cutaneous metastases from neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix-An unusual metastatic lesion from an uncommon malignancy Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is an uncommon and aggressive type of small cell cervical cancer. NECs mostly arise from gastro-entero-pancreatic tract and the lung, but rarely from other organs like cervix. NEC of the cervix is a rare malignancy and constitutes 0.9%-1.5% of cervical tumors. NECs of cervix are common in perimenopausal females and present with abnormal vaginal bleeding and mimic squamous cell cancers, usually with no distinguishing features. On Immunohistochemistry, presence of chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD-56 is necessary to make a diagnosis of small cell carcinoma. These tumors are notorious for local as well as distant relapses in comparison to their squamous and adenocarcinoma counterpart. NECs are characterized by highly aggressive clinical behavior and carry a poor prognosis. They commonly metastases to lung, liver, brain, and bones even in early stages of the disease. Metastasis to skin is a rare occurrence. We herein report a case of a NEC of the uterine cervix with multiple cutaneous metastases. After the initial diagnosis of NEC of cervix, the patient received concurrent chemoradiation followed by intracavitary brachytherapy. On subsequent follow-up, the patient developed multiple cutaneous metastasis along with liver metastases. This case is reported in view of rarity of the case with skin metastases. To the best of our knowledge, only 3 cases of cutaneous metastases from NEC of the cervix are reported till date. Being a rare malignancy, evidence in the literature is in form of case reports and small case series. Thus, the optimal treatment strategy varies for these patients.

2844,"Therapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells can result from deregulated EGFR signaling The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with various downstream molecules including phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/GSK-3, Jak/STAT and others. Often these pathways are deregulated in human malignancies such as breast cancer. Various therapeutic approaches to inhibit the activity of EGFR family members including small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) have been developed. A common problem with cancer treatments is the development of drug-resistance. We examined the effects of a conditionally-activated EGFR (v-Erb-B:ER) on the resistance of breast cancer cells to commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-flurouracil as well as ionizing radiation (IR). v-Erb-B is similar to the EGFR-variant EGFRvIII, which is expressed in various cancers including breast, brain, prostate. Both v-Erb-B and EGFRvIII encode the EGFR kinase domain but lack key components present in the extracellular domain of EGFR which normally regulate its activity and ligand-dependence. The v-Erb-B oncogene was ligated to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) which results in regulation of the activity of the v-Erb-ER construct by addition of either estrogen (E2) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) to the culture media. Introduction of the v-Erb-B:ER construct into the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line increased the resistance to the cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs, hormonal-based therapeutics and IR. These results point to the important effects that aberrant expression of EGFR kinase domain can have on therapeutic resistance.",Excluded
2067,"Neuroimaging and quality-of-life outcomes in patients with brain metastasis and peritumoral edema who undergo Gamma Knife surgery OBJECT: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) has been shown to be effective for treating many patients with brain metastasis. Some brain metastases demonstrate significant peritumoral edema; radiation may induce cerebral edema or worsening preexisting edema. This study was conducted to evaluate the imaging and neurobehavioral outcomes in patients with preexisting peritumoral edema who then undergo GKS.METHODS: Between August 2003 and January 2008, 63 cases of brain metastasis with significant peritumoral edema (> 20 cm(3)) were prospectively studied. The study inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a single metastatic lesion with significant edema (perilesional edema signal volume on FLAIR > 20 cm(3)); and 2) inclusion of only 1 lesion > 20 cm(3) in the study (in cases of multiple lesions noted on FLAIR images). All patients received MR imaging with pulse sequences including T1-weighted imaging and FLAIR with or without contrast and T2-weighted imaging at an interval of 3 months. A neurological assessment and Brain Cancer Module (BCM-20) questionnaire were obtained every 2-3 months. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used for analysis of survival and associated factors.RESULTS: At the time of GKS, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 70 (range 50-90), and the mean BCM-20 score was 45.5 +/- 6.1. The mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) was 5.2 +/- 4.6 cm(3) with corresponding T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volumes of 59.25 +/- 37.3 and 62.1 +/- 38.8 cm(3), respectively (R(2) = 0.977, p < 0.001). The mean edema index (volume of peritumoral edema/tumor volume) was 17.5 +/- 14.5. The mean peripheral and maximum GKS doses were 17.4 +/- 2.3 and 35 +/- 4.7 Gy, respectively. The median survival was 11 months. The longer survival was related to KPS scores >or= 70 (p = 0.008), age < 65 years (p = 0.022), and a reduction of > 6 in BCM-20 score (p = 0.007), but survival was not related to preexisting edema or tumor volume. A reduction in BCM-20 score of > 6 was related to decreased volume in T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging (p < 0.001). Thirty-eight (79.2%) of 48 patients demonstrated decreased tumor volume and accompanied by decreased T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volume. Eight (16.7%) of the 48 patients exhibited increased or stable tumor volume. A margin dose > 18 Gy was more likely to afford tumor reduction and resolution of peritumoral edema (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively). However, prior external-beam radiation therapy correlated with worsened preexisting peritumoral edema (p = 0.013) and longer maintenance of corticosteroids (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients demonstrating a reduction in the BCM-20 score > 6, age < 65 years, and KPS score >or= 70 exhibited longer survival. Significant preexisting edema did not influence the tumor response or clinical outcome. The resolution of edema was related to better quality of life but not to longer survival.",Excluded

We examined the effect of early treatment of high-dose dexamethasone on iridium-192-induced damage to normal brain tissue.METHODS: Brain damage induced by interstitial irradiation with iridium-192 was evaluated with sequential magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 11 adult monkeys, with or without short-term high-dose dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg of body weight/d) was administered intramuscularly to five irradiated animals every 24 hours, beginning 2 days before and ending 7 days after irradiation. Magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after irradiation.RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 week after irradiation revealed marked edema in five nontreated animals. In dexamethasone-treated animals, the volume of edema was reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 1 week and 1 month after irradiation. The volume of ring enhancement in dexamethasone-treated animals was also reduced significantly, compared to that of nontreated animals, 3 months after the irradiation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra revealed that N-acetylaspartate and choline peaks were reduced 1 week after irradiation in both groups. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at any time points.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that dexamethasone treatment may have an antiedema effect at an early stage and may modify subsequent development of vascular and inflammatory changes but may have no effect of preventing radiation-induced necrosis and the reduction of N-acetylaspartate after brachytherapy.",Included

Pineal and serum melatonin concentrations, pineal activities of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and of monoamine oxidase (MAO) were determined. The NAT activities in the rats irradiated with 4.8 and 9.6 Gy decreased at some intervals without changes of melatonin concentration. Irradiation with a total dose of 14.4 Gy decreased NAT activity and the concentration of pineal and serum melatonin 6 h and 3 days after the last exposure. The activity of MAO, estimated only in the rats irradiated with the dose of 14.4 Gy, increased significantly 3 days after irradiation. The fractionated irradiation up to the dose of 14.4 Gy caused a transient decrease in pineal melatonin synthesis. This could be the consequence of preferential oxidative deamination of serotonin in comparison with its N-acetylation, leading to melatonin biosynthesis.",Included

1971,"Spatial correlation of linear energy transfer and relative biological effectiveness with suspected treatment-related toxicities following proton therapy for intracranial tumors PURPOSE: The enhanced relative biological effectiveness (RBE) at the end of the proton range might increase the risk of radiation-induced toxicities. This is of special concern for intracranial treatments where several critical organs at risk (OARs) surround the tumor. In the light of this, a retrospective analysis of dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET<sub>d</sub> ) and RBE-weighted dose (D<sub>RBE</sub> ) distributions was conducted for three clinical cases with suspected treatment-related toxicities following intracranial proton therapy. Alternative treatment strategies aiming to reduce toxicity risks are also presented.METHODS: The clinical single-field optimized (SFO) plans were recalculated for 81 error scenarios with a Monte Carlo dose engine. The fractionation D<sub>RBE</sub> was 1.8 Gy (RBE) in 28 or 30 fractions assuming a constant RBE of 1.1. Two LET<sub>d</sub> - and alpha/beta-dependent variable RBE models were used for evaluation, including a sensitivity analysis of the alpha/beta parameter. Resulting distributions of D<sub>RBE</sub> and LET<sub>d</sub> were analyzed together with normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs). Subsequently, four multi-field optimized (MFO) plans, with an additional beam and/or objectives penalizing protons stopping in OARs, were created to investigate the potential reduction of LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP.RESULTS: The two variable RBE models agreed well and predicted average RBE values around 1.3 in the toxicity volumes, resulting in an increased near-maximum D<sub>RBE</sub> of 7-11 Gy (RBE) compared to RBE = 1.1 in the nominal scenario. The corresponding NTCP estimates increased from 0.8%, 0.0%, and 3.7% (RBE = 1.1) to 15.5%, 1.8%, and 45.7% (Wedenberg RBE model) for the three patients, respectively. The MFO plans generally allowed for LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP reductions in OARs, without compromising the target dose. Compared to the clinical SFO plans, the maximum reduction in the near-maximum LET<sub>d</sub> was 56%, 63%, and 72% in the OAR exhibiting the toxicity for the three patients, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Although a direct causality between RBE and toxicity cannot be established here, high LET<sub>d</sub> and D<sub>RBE</sub> correlated spatially with the observed toxicities, whereas setup and range uncertainties had a minor impact. Individual factors, which might affect the patient-specific radiosensitivity, were however not included in these calculations. The MFO plans using both an additional beam and proton track-end objectives allowed the largest reductions in LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP, and might be future tools for similar cases.",Excluded

2172,"Fractional anisotropy dose-response relationship of the corpus callosum Purpose or Objective: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive modality for determination of water diffusion properties. Fractional anisotropy (FA) quantifies the extent of directionality of water diffusion. We investigated absorbed dose as a predictor of FA change in the corpus callosum (CC) following radiation therapy for high grade glioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with high-grade glioma underwent DTI scans before, and ten months after radiation therapy to 59.4-60 Gy. Diffusion data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Using an automated white matter fiber tracking technique, 23 fiber tracts were segmented on the baseline and follow-up DTI images. The CT images used for treatment planning and both DTI image sets were aligned using non-linear registration. This way, the baseline FA, the follow-up FA, and the absorbed dose could be determined for each voxel in all 15 patients. For each voxel in the CC, we calculated the FA change as FA follow-up /FA baseline and dichotomized the data into a binary outcome variable using 0.5 as cutoff. For all 15 patients, logistic regression was used to determine dose-response curve parameters (D50 and g50) and their confidence intervals (CIs). We used the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) to evaluate the discriminative ability of the voxel dose. Then, we estimated dose-response curve parameters and calculated the AUC for each patient individually. Result(s): The median age was 59 (range: 40-85) years. The average CC volume and average CC mean absorbed dose was 62+/-8 cm3 and 26+/-14 Gy (1 SD), respectively. Using data from 99 691 voxels, the estimated parameters for the doseresponse curve for all patients (upper panel in Figure 1) were D50=88.0+/-0.1 Gy and gamma50=0.80+/-0.01 (95% CIs). The AUC was 0.71 indicating good discriminative ability.

Dose -response curves for those patients are shown in the lower panel in Figure 1 and their estimated parameter values in Table 1. Individual D50s varied between 41.3 and 125.9 Gy.

261,"Distinct response of adult neural stem cells to low versus high dose ionising radiation Radiosusceptibility is the sensitivity of a biological organism to ionising radiation (IR)-induced carcinogenesis, an outcome of IR exposure relevant following low doses. The tissue response is strongly influenced by the DNA damage response (DDR) activated in stem and progenitor cells. We previously reported that in vivo exposure to 2 Gy X-rays activates apoptosis, proliferation arrest and premature differentiation in neural progenitor cells (transit amplifying cells and neuroblasts) but not in neural stem cells (NSCs) of the largest neurogenic region of the adult brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ). These responses promote adult quiescent NSC (qNSC) activation after 2 Gy. In contrast, neonatal (P5) SVZ neural progenitors continue proliferating and do not activate qNSCs. Significantly, the human and mouse neonatal brain is radiosusceptible. Here, we examine the response of stem and progenitor cells in the SVZ to low IR doses (50-500 mGy). We observe a linear dose-response for apoptosis but, in contrast, proliferation arrest and neuroblast differentiation require a threshold dose of 200 or 500 mGy, respectively. Importantly, qNSCs were not activated at doses below 500 mGy. Thus, full DDR activation in the neural stem cell compartment in vivo necessitates a threshold dose, which can be considered of significance when evaluating IR-induced cancer risk and dose extrapolation.",Included

Here we show that much of the sustained surround antagonism in certain on-center ganglion cells results from lateral inhibition in the inner retina, via GABAergic amacrine cells, and that the lateral conduction of this signal requires voltage-gated sodium currents. Blocking lateral inhibition in the inner retina eliminates the preference of small-center ganglion cells for small stimuli but has little effect on ganglion cells with large receptive-field centers. These results illustrate how lateral inhibition at successive synaptic stages can selectively control the size of neural receptive-field centers.",Excluded
3108,"Dosimetric performance of two linear accelerator-based radiosurgery systems to treat single and multiplebrain metastases OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the dosimetric plan quality for noncoplanar volumetric arc therapy of single and multiple brain metastases using the linear accelerator-based radiosurgery system HyperArc and a robotic radiosurgery system.METHODS: 31 tumors from 24 patients were treated by stereotactic radiosurgery using the CyberKnife system. CT images, structure sets, and dose files were transferred to the Eclipse treatment planning system for the HyperArc system. Dosimetric parameters for both plans were compared. The beam-on time was calculated from the total monitor unit and dose rate.RESULTS: For normal brain tissue, the received volume doses were significantly lower for HyperArc than for CyberKnife_G4 and strongly correlated with the planning target volume (PTV) for cases of single brain metastasis. In addition, the difference in volume dose between CyberKnife_G4 and HyperArc was proportional to the PTV. For multiple brain metastases, no significant difference was observed between the two stereotactic radiosurgery systems, except for high-dose region in the normal tissue. In low dose for brain minus PTV, when the maximum distance among each target was above 8.0 cm, HyperArc delivered higher dose than CyberKnife_G4. The mean +/- SDs for the beam-on time were 15.8 +/- 5.3 and 5.6 +/- 0.8 min for CyberKnife_G4 and HyperArc, respectively (p < .01).CONCLUSION: HyperArc is best suited for larger targets in single brain metastasis and for smaller inter tumor tumor distances in multiple brain metastases.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The performance of HyperArc in comparison with CyberKnife_G4 was depended on defined margin and tumor distances.",Excluded
1545,"Effects of subchronic exposure to a 1439 MHz electromagnetic field on the microcirculatory parameters in rat brain UNLABELLED: THE AIM of this study was to investigate whether repeated exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) of 1439 MHz affects the cerebral microcirculation, including blood-brain barrier function, in a rat brain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The head of the rat was exposed for four weeks (60 min/day, 5 days/week) to RF-EMF at 2.4 W/kg of brain averaged specific absorption rate (BASAR). Three microcirculatory parameters: blood-brain barrier permeability, leukocyte behavior and plasma velocity were measured before and after RF-EMF exposure using a closed cranial window method.RESULTS: No extravasation of intravenously injected dyes from pial venules was found at any BASAR level. No significant changes in the number of endothelial-adhering leukocytes after exposure were found. The plasma velocity remained constant within the physiological range through each exposure.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that there were no effects on the cerebral microcirculation under the given RF-EMF exposure conditions.",Excluded
7,"Increase of mtDNA number and its mutant copies in rat brain after exposure to 150 MeV protons Proton beam therapy is widely used for treating brain tumor. Despite the efficacy of treatment, the use of this therapy has met some limitations associated with possible damage to normal brain tissues located beyond the tumor site. In this context, the exploration of the harmful effects of protons on the normal brain tissues is of particular interest. We have investigated changes in the total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and identified mtDNA mutant copies in three brain regions (the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum) of rats after irradiation their whole-head with 150 MeV protons at doses of 3 and 5 Gy. The study was performed in 2-months old male Spraque Dawley rats (n = 5 each group). The mtDNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR. The level of mtDNA heteroplasmy was estimated using Surveyor nuclease technology. Our results show that after head exposure to protons, levels of mtDNA copy number in three rat brain regions increase significantly as the levels of mtDNA mutant copies increase. The most significant elevation is observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, an increase in mtDNA mutant copies may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by increased oxidative stress in different brain regions and promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the induction of carcinogenesis.",Included
2046,"Response of intracerebral human glioblastoma xenografts to multifraction radiation exposures PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of fractionated radiation treatments on the life spans of athymic rats bearing intracerebral brain tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: U-251 MG or U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells were implanted into the brains of athymic rats, and the resulting tumors were irradiated once daily with various doses of ionizing radiation for 5 consecutive days or for 10 days with a 2-day break after Day 5.RESULTS: Five daily doses of 1 and 1.5 Gy, and 10 doses of 0.75 and 1 Gy, cured some U-251 MG tumors. However, five daily doses of 0.5 Gy increased the survival time of animals bearing U-251 MG tumors 5 days without curing any animals of their tumors. Ten doses of 0.3 Gy given over 2 weeks extended the lifespan of the host animals 9 days without curing any animals. For U-87 MG tumors, 5 daily doses of 3 Gy produced an increased lifespan of 8 days without curing any animals, and 10 doses of 1 Gy prolonged lifespan 5.5 days without curing any animals. The differences in extension of life span between the 5- and 10-fraction protocols were minor for either tumor type.CONCLUSION: The finding that the U-251 MG tumors are more sensitive than U-87 MG tumors, despite the fact that U-251 MG tumors contain many more hypoxic cells than U-87 MG tumors, suggests the intrinsic cellular radiosensitivities of these cell lines are more important than hypoxia in determining their in vivo radiosensitivities.",Excluded
1062,"Carotid ultrasound identifies high risk subclinical atherosclerosis in adults with low framingham risk scores BACKGROUND: Worldwide, cardiovascular (CV) disease remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality. Although effective in predicting CV risk in select populations, the Framingham risk score (FRS) fails to identify many young individuals who experience premature CV events. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of high-risk carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) or plaque, a marker of atherosclerosis and predictor of CV events, in young asymptomatic individuals with low and intermediate FRS (<2% annualized event rate) using the carotid ultrasound protocol recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Vascular Medicine.METHODS: Individuals aged < or = 65 years not taking statins and without diabetes mellitus or histories of coronary artery disease underwent CIMT and plaque examination for primary prevention. Clinical variables including lipid values, family history of premature coronary artery disease, and FRS and subsequent pharmacotherapy recommendations were retrospectively collected for statistical analysis.RESULTS: Of 441 subjects (mean age, 49.7 + or - 7.9 years), 184 (42%; 95% confidence interval, 37.3%-46.5%) had high-risk carotid ultrasound findings (CIMT > or = 75th percentile adjusted for age, gender, and race or presence of plaque). Of those with the lowest FRS of < or =5% (n = 336) (mean age, 48.0 + or - 7.6 years; mean FRS, 2.5 + or - 1.5%), 127 (38%; 95% confidence interval, 32.6%-43.0%) had high-risk carotid ultrasound findings. For individuals with FRS < or = 5% and high-risk carotid ultrasound findings (n = 127; mean age, 47.3 + or - 8.1 years; mean FRS, 2.5 + or - 1.5%), lipid-lowering therapy was recommended by their treating physicians in 77 (61%).CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-eight percent of asymptomatic young to middle-aged individuals with FRS < or = 5% have abnormal carotid ultrasound findings associated with increased risk for CV events. Pharmacologic therapy for CV prevention was recommended in the majority of these individuals. The lack of radiation exposure, relatively low cost, and ability to detect early-stage atherosclerosis suggest that carotid ultrasound for CIMT and plaque detection should continue to be explored as a primary tool for CV risk stratification in young to middle-aged adults with low FRS.",Excluded
2622,"Effects of ionizing radiation on brain metastasis-associated inflammation and its implication for immunotherapy Brain metastases represent the most common intracranial tumor in adults associated with poor prognosis and median survival of only a few months. Despite current success in the development of targeted or immunotherapies against different cancer entities, those strategies are ineffective against brain metastases. Hence, treatment options for brain metastasis patients largely remain limited to surgical resection and radioand/ or chemotherapy. This paucity can in part be attributed to the immune-privileged status of the brain where the blood brain-barrier restricts the entry of blood-borne immune cells. However, recent insights into the immune landscape of primary brain cancers indicate that tumor progression leads to an infiltration of blood-borne immune cells into the brain. We employ a comprehensive set of experimental brain metastasis models to characterize the immune landscape of brain metastases from different primary cancer entities at distinct disease stages and in response to radiotherapy. Our data indicate that brain metastases induce massive infiltration of myeloid and lymphoid cell populations into the central nervous system. This leads to the establishment of a dynamic and highly complex tumor microenvironment that affects tumor progression and therapy response. Fractionated whole-brain radiotherapy leads to enhanced infiltration of blood-borne myeloid and lymphoid cells. Transcriptome analysis of brain-resident and recruited myeloid cells indicate a switch from a proinflammatory towards an immune-suppressive environment at advanced disease stages. Importantly, radiotherapy was found to induce gene signatures that are associated with proinflammatory innate immune responses that could revert the establishment of an immune-suppressive environment. Consequently, radiotherapy might sensitize brain metastases towards immunotherapies. Our goal is to identify pathways or molecular targets that are induced by radiotherapy in the tumor microenvironment to overcome resistance against immunotherapy. In this project, we seek to test strategies to maintain or induce proinflammatory immune responses for improved targeted or immunotherapies against brain metastasis.",Excluded
393,"Pineal parenchymal tumor - Clinical experience from a regional cancer centre in north India Introduction: Pineal parenchymal tumor constitutes less than 1% of primitive tumors of the CNS and is classified by WHO into pineocytoma (PC)-grade I, pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation (PPTID)-grade II/III and pinealoblastoma (PB)-grade IV. Material(s) and Method(s): We intended to assess the clinical features and treatment outcome in patients of pineal parenchymal tumor attending our hospital from 2003-13. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): 23 patients met the study criterion (median age=22 years and male: female=14:9). Presenting complaints included headache (73.91%), visual symptoms (43.48%), vomiting (30.43%) and ataxia (26.09%). Preoperative contrast enhanced MRI and CT scan of brain were performed in 78.26% and 17.3% of patients respectively. Spinal drop metastasis and CSF cytology positivity were noted in 3 and 2 patients respectively. Surgery included gross total resection in 21.74%, near total resection in 13.04%, subtotal resection in 17.39% and tumor biopsy in 43.48% of the patients. 12 (52.17%) patients required the placement of VP shunt. Histopathology was confirmative of PB in 14 (60.87%) patients, PPTID in 6 (26.09%) patients and PC in 3 (13.04%) patients. MIB-1 labeling index varied from 2-80% with median value of 30% and 4.5% in PB and PPTID respectively. 22 (95.65%) patients underwent radiation therapy- craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in 14(60.87%) patients, whole brain radiation in 1 patient, whole ventricular radiation in 1 patient and local radiation in 6 (26.09%) patients. Majority (85.7%) of patients of PB underwent CSI- 36 Gy/ 20 fractions/ 4 weeks to whole brain followed by boost of 20 Gy/10 fractions/ 2 weeks to pineal region and 30-36 Gy/ 20 fractions/ 4 weeks to spinal axis as per risk stratification. Systemic chemotherapy was administered in 12 (52.17%) patients (11-PB and 1-PC) with EP (etoposide and carboplatin) being the most common regimen (30.43%). The median number of cycles administered was 6 (range 3-6). After a median follow-up of 26.87 months, death and recurrence were observed in 2 and 10 patients (local recurrence- 34.78% and spinal drop metastases- 26.09%) respectively. Median RFS was noted to be 2.33 years, 14.29 years and 6.76 years in patients of PB, PPTID and PC respectively. The 2 and 3 year actuarial RFS rates in the entire cohort were respectively 71.6% and 57.9%. Salvage treatment was offered in 6 patients. Median overall survival was not reached. On univariate analysis (Log rank test), age (<18 versus >18 years), sex, histology, extent of surgery (biopsy versus resection) and use of chemotherapy had no significant impact on RFS. Conclusion(s): Maximal safe resection followed by radiation therapy is the mainstay of treatment in pineal parenchymal tumor. Radiation volume encompasses the craniospinal axis in pinealoblastoma and the tumor bed with margin in pineocytoma. Platinum based combination chemotherapy should be added in adjuvant treatment in pinealoblastoma.",Excluded
1275,"Light-Dependent OCT Structure Changes in Photoreceptor Degenerative rd 10 Mouse Retina Purpose: Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to analyze the effects of light/dark adaptation in a mouse model of inherited photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), and to study dynamics of subretinal fluid during the progress of retinal degeneration.Methods: rd10 and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were reared in cyclic light or darkness and imaged with Bioptigen UHR-OCT or Spectralis HRA+OCT after adaptation to either light or darkness.Results: OCT images from rd10 mice were analyzed at three progressive stages of degeneration. After light-adaptation, stage I (postnatal age [P]26-29) eyes demonstrated no apparent subretinal fluid. At stage II (P32-38), subretinal fluid was present and restricted to parapapillary area, while at stage III (P44-45) extensive subretinal fluid was present across many retinal areas. Following overnight dark-adaptation, WT eyes showed a large reduction in outer retinal thickness (4.6 +/- 1.4 mum, n = 16), whereas this change was significantly smaller in stage I rd10 eyes (1.5 +/- 0.5 mum, n = 14). In stage II rd10 eyes, dark-adaptation significantly reduced the extent of subretinal fluid, with the amount of reduction correlating with the amount of fluid pre-existing in the light-adapted state. However, dark-adaptation did not significantly alter the amount of subretinal fluid observed in stage III rd10 mice. In addition, dark-rearing of rd10 mice from P6 to P30 slowed retinal degeneration.Conclusions: Visual experience in the form of light/dark adaptation exerts a significant effect on outer retinal structure in the context of photoreceptor degeneration. This effect may arise from light-dependent alterations in fluid transport across the RPE monolayer, and promote photoreceptor survival as induced by dark-rearing.",Excluded

We report a 60-year-old woman with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) heavily pretreated with cladribine based regimens and rituximab in whom RS in the brain was first manifested as a stroke. Initial cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypodense area in the right parietal lobe showing no contrast enhancement. The follow-up CT done after 2 months showed an irregular, slightly hyperdense tumor surrounded by oedema with mass effect and midline shift. However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed no pathological changes. Neurosurgical operation was performed and the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been established on the basis of histological and immunological investigation of the tumor. The pattern of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in the patients' bone marrow aspirate and brain tumor was identical and suggested that both tumors originated from the same B-cell progenitors.

1503,"Extracellular currents alter gap junction intercellular communication in synovial fibroblasts We studied the effect of extremely low frequency (ELF) currents on gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) mediated by connexin43 protein. Confluent monolayers of synovial fibroblasts (HIG-82) and neuroblastoma cells (5Y) were exposed in bath solution to 0-75 mA/m(2) (0-56 mV/m), 60 Hz. Single channel conductance, cell membrane current-voltage (I-V) curves, and Ca(2+) influx were measured using the nystatin single and double patch methods. The conductances of the closed and open states of the gap junction channel in HIG-82 cells were each significantly reduced (by 0.76 and 0.39 pA, respectively) in cells exposed to 20 mA/m(2). Current densities as low as 10 mA/m(2) significantly increased Ca(2+) influx in HIG-82 cells. No effects were seen in 5Y cells. The I-V curves of the plasma membranes of both types of cells were independent of 60 Hz electric fields and current densities, 0-75 mA/m(2), indicating that the effect of the 60 Hz fields on GJIC in HIG-82 cells was not mediated by a change in membrane potential. We conclude that ELF electric fields can alter GJIC in synovial cells via a mechanism that does not depend on changes in membrane potential, but may depend on Ca(2+) influx. The results open the possibility that GJIC mediated responses in synovial cells, such as for example, their secretory responses to proinflammatory cytokines, could be antagonized by the application of ELF electric fields.",Excluded
2187,"Treatment of near-skull brain tissue with a focused device using shear-mode conversion: a numerical study Shear mode transmission through the skull has been previously proposed as a new trans-skull propagation technique for noninvasive therapeutic ultrasound (Clement 2004 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115 1356-64). The main advantage of choosing shear over longitudinal mode resides on the fact that there is less wavefront distortion with the former. In the present study, the regions of the brain suitable for shear-mode transmission were established for a simple focused ultrasound device. The device consists of a spherically curved transducer that has a focal length of 10 cm, an aperture between 30 degrees and 60 degrees and operates at 0.74 MHz. The regions suitable for shear-mode transmission were determined by the shear wave acoustic windows that matched the shape of the device acoustic field. The acoustic windows were calculated using segmentation and triangulation of outer and inner faces of skull from 3D-MRI head datasets. Nine heads of healthy adults were analyzed. The surface considered for the calculations was the head region found above the supra-orbital margin. For every inspected point in the brain volume, the axis of the device was determined by the vector between this inspection point and a point located in the center of the brain. Numerical predictions of the acoustic field, where shear-mode conversion through the skull was considered, were obtained and compared to the case of water-only conditions. The brain tissue that is close to the skull showed suitable acoustic windows for shear waves. The central region of the brain seems to be unreachable using shear-mode. Analysis of the acoustic fields showed a proportional relation between the acoustic window for shear mode and the effective degree of focusing. However, this relation showed significant differences among specimens. In general, highly focused fields were obtained when the acoustic window for shear waves (A(SW)) intersected more than 67% of the entering acoustic window (A(TX)) of the device. The average depth from the inner surface of the skull showing this intersection value was 13 +/- 10 mm (mean +/- SD). The differences of the degree of focusing observed among patients suggest that the intersection A(SW) intersection A(TX) can be used as a preliminary criterion for screening and calculation of the acoustic fields should confirm the degree of focusing patient by patient. In conclusion, shear waves provide a useful method for trans-cranial focusing in regions close to the skull surface.",Excluded

At the beginning of the rapid phase of testicular growth and onset of peak gonadotropin secretion (15 days of age), males were treated for 10 days with either short days (10 L:14 D; n = 6), or remained in long days (16 L:8 D; n = 5) and injected each afternoon with melatonin. These treatments arrested testicular growth compared to the gonadal development that occurred in long-day controls (n = 9). Every brain section (60 microns) from the olfactory bulb to the anterior hypothalamus was processed for GnRH immunocytochemistry and viewed under brightfield light microscopy. GnRH cell bodies had smooth contours and were morphologically bipolar or unipolar. The number of bipolar neurons was similar regardless of treatment (about 170/brain). However, fewer unipolar GnRH cell bodies (p less than 0.05) were found in males in short days (73 +/- 11) or in males administered melatonin (72 +/- 14) compared to the unipolar number in hamsters in long days (132 +/- 14). With respect to neuroanatomical distribution, significantly fewer unipolar GnRH neurons were found in the medial preoptic area of males treated with short days or melatonin (55-70% decrease) compared to cell numbers in long-day controls.

2037,"Impact of image denoising on image quality, quantitative parameters and sensitivity of ultra-low-dose volume perfusion CT imaging OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of denoising on ultra-low-dose volume perfusion CT (ULD-VPCT) imaging in acute stroke.METHODS: Simulated ULD-VPCT data sets at 20 % dose rate were generated from perfusion data sets of 20 patients with suspected ischemic stroke acquired at 80 kVp/180 mAs. Four data sets were generated from each ULD-VPCT data set: not-denoised (ND); denoised using spatiotemporal filter (D1); denoised using quanta-stream diffusion technique (D2); combination of both methods (D1 + D2). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured in the resulting 100 data sets. Image quality, presence/absence of ischemic lesions, CBV and CBF scores according to a modified ASPECTS score were assessed by two blinded readers.RESULTS: SNR and qualitative scores were highest for D1 + D2 and lowest for ND (all p <= 0.001). In 25 % of the patients, ND maps were not assessable and therefore excluded from further analyses. Compared to original data sets, in D2 and D1 + D2, readers correctly identified all patients with ischemic lesions (sensitivity 1.0, kappa 1.0). Lesion size was most accurately estimated for D1 + D2 with a sensitivity of 1.0 (CBV) and 0.94 (CBF) and an inter-rater agreement of 1.0 and 0.92, respectively.CONCLUSION: An appropriate combination of denoising techniques applied in ULD-VPCT produces diagnostically sufficient perfusion maps at substantially reduced dose rates as low as 20 % of the normal scan.KEY POINTS: Perfusion-CT is an accurate tool for the detection of brain ischemias. The high associated radiation doses are a major drawback of brain perfusion CT. Decreasing tube current in perfusion CT increases image noise and deteriorates image quality. Combination of different image-denoising techniques produces sufficient image quality from ultra-low-dose perfusion CT.",Excluded
3111,"Focal, high dose, and fractionated modified stereotactic radiation therapy for lung carcinoma patients: a preliminary experience BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiation therapy is highly effective in the treatment of small brain metastases, regardless of the histology. This suggests that small extracranial malignancies may be curable with similar radiation therapy. The authors developed a novel treatment unit for administering such therapy.METHODS: The unit consisted of a linear accelerator (linac), an X-ray simulator (X-S), computed tomography (CT), and a table. The gantry axes of the three machines were coaxial and could be matched by rotating the table. Patients were instructed to perform shallow respiration with oxygen. The motion of the tumor was monitored with the X-S. When the motion was slight enough, the table was rotated to the CT. To include all geometric movement on the CT images, each scan was made while the patient was performing shallow respiration. After the CT positioning, the table was rotated to the linac, and non-coplanar treatment was given. Beginning in October 1994, 45 patients with 23 primary or 43 metastatic lung carcinomas were treated. Radiation doses at the 80% isodose line were 30-75 gray in 5-15 fractions over 1-3 weeks with or without conventional radiation therapy.RESULTS: The treatment was performed with no or minimal adverse acute symptoms. The daily treatment time was short. During a median follow-up of 11 months, local progression occurred in 2 of 66 lesions. Interstitial changes in the lung were limited.CONCLUSIONS: With this unit and procedure, focal radiation therapy similar to stereotactic radiation therapy is possible for extracranial sites. The preliminary experience appeared safe and promising, and further exploration of this approach is warranted.",Excluded

TSPO imaging is expected to be useful for the clinical evaluation of neuroinflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to provide dosimetry estimates for [(18)F]FEDAA1106 based on human whole-body PET measurements.METHODS: PET scans were performed for a total of 6.6 h after the injection of 183.8 +/- 9.1 MBq of [(18)F]FEDAA1106 in six healthy subjects. Regions of interest were drawn on coronal images. Estimates of the absorbed doses of radiation were calculated using the OLINDA software.RESULTS: Peak uptake was largest in lungs, followed by liver, small intestine, kidney, spleen and other organs. Peak values of the percent injected dose (%ID) at a time after radioligand injection were calculated for the lungs (27.1%ID at 0.2 h), liver (21.1%ID at 0.6 h), small intestine (10.4%ID at 6.3 h), kidney (4.9%ID at 1.8 h) and spleen (4.6%ID at 0.6 h). The largest absorbed dose was found in the spleen (0.12 mSv/MBq), followed by kidneys (0.094 mSv/MBq). The calculated mean effective dose was 0.036 mSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the estimated radiation burden of [(18)F]FEDAA1106 is moderately higher than that of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). In clinical studies, the administered activity of this radioligand ought to be adjusted in line with regional regulations.

To assess if this occurs clinically, we analyzed circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for EMT markers (EMT-CTC) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiation. Materials/Methods: This prospective study enrolled 22 patients between April 2011 and May 2012. The primary endpoint was distant metastatic free survival (DMFS) rates. None had induction chemotherapy. One patient had hypofractionated protons without chemotherapy. Serial blood samples (20 mL) were drawn at baseline (pretreatment), twice during treatment, and once at first follow-up. One tube of blood (10 mL) was sent to enumerate cytokeratin (CK)-positive/CD45-negative cells (HD-CTCs) using an automated microscopic image analysis system. A second tube was analyzed using the StemDx assay, a quantitative PCR-based assay to detect transcripts of EMT markers (SNAIL, TWIST, TG2, and CMET) on CTC in peripheral blood samples depleted of CD326/EpCAM+ CTC and CD45+ leukocytes by antibody coated magnetic beads. DMFS time was counted from date of first blood draw to the DM or death or last contact. Deaths without DM on the date of last contact were counted as events. Due to the small sample size, all times to event were subjected to univariable analysis using the method of Kaplan-Meier and the comparisons of distributions between groups were made using the log-rank test. Result(s): Patients had either stage 3A/B (n = 16), oligometastatic stage 4 (bone or brain) (n=2), or localized recurrent or positive margin disease after surgery that was amendable for definitive treatment (n = 4). The median follow-up for all patients from the time of first blood draw to the last contact date or death was 9.5 months, and for living patients was 11.1 months. At last follow-up, 8 had died, 8 progressed with DM, and 2 had in-field local relapse. Using the Epic Sciences assay,DMFSwas significantly associated with>=10 HD-CTCs/mL of blood (p = 0.036). The presence of CMET or SNAIL transcripts on CTC by StemDx also significantly predicted for both DMFS (p= 0.036) and recurrence of any type (p =0.02). Conclusion(s): In this pilot study, we found an association between DMFS and either >= 10 HD-CTC/mL of blood or EMT markers CMET or SNAIL in NSCLC patients undergoing definitive chemoradiation. While these data need to be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients, EMT-CTCs may reflect metastatic burden as seen in some of the patients with elevated HD-CTC counts, and may be valuable biomarkers to risk stratify patients after definitive chemoradiation.",Excluded

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of Bcl2 also demonstrated a decrease in expression after 12 months in 11.5 Gy BBT-059 treated mice as compared to other groups. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that higher doses of ionizing radiation (IR) can cause persistent upregulation of mitochondrial degeneration. Reduced levels of Sqstm1 and Bcl2 can lead to intensive autophagy which can lead to degradation of cellular structure.",Included
179,"Postoperative radiation for lung cancer metastatic to the brain PURPOSE: Although resection of single brain metastases and postoperative whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) improves survival, compared with treatment using WBRT alone, the value of postoperative WBRT after resection of brain metastases is controversial. We analyzed the largest reported series of lung cancer patients with resected brain metastases to evaluate the impact of postoperative WBRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1989, 185 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) underwent resection of brain metastases. Patients who had received preoperative WBRT (23%, 42 of 185) were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into group A (no WBRT; n = 32), group B (patients received WBRT and were prognostically matched to group A; n = 32), and group C (all other WBRT patients; n = 79). Most patients received postoperative doses of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Higher doses were used in 16% of group B and 18% of group C patients.RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival rates were as follows: group A, 12%; B, 8%; C, 16%. Overall brain failures occurred in 38% of patients in group A, 47% in group B, and 42% in group C. The use of WBRT (group A v groups B plus C) had no apparent impact on survival or on overall brain failure rates. In particular, no improvement in either of these parameters could be demonstrated when group B was compared with group A. Focal failure (defined as failure within the brain adjacent to the site of the resected brain metastases) occurred as follows: group A, 34% (11 of 32); groups B plus C, 23% (25 of 111) (P = .07). WBRT significantly reduced focal failure for patients with adenocarcinoma (group A, 33% [eight of 24]; groups B plus C, 14% [11 of 79]; P = .05). Nonfocal failure (anatomically distinct from the resected metastasis) occurred in 9% of patients in group A (three of 32), 21% in groups B plus C (23 of 111) (P = .07).CONCLUSION: Long-term survival is possible when NSCLC brain metastases are resected. Postoperative WBRT as used in this series only had an impact on the focal control of brain metastases and this effect was of borderline significance. The lack of conclusive benefit supports the need for ongoing randomized trials to test the value of adjuvant postoperative WBRT. Brain failures were relatively common in all three groups of patients, which suggests that doses greater than 30 Gy need to be studied.",Included
3015,"Diagnostic accuracy of whole-brain computed tomographic perfusion imaging in small-volume infarctions PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic accuracy of whole-brain computed tomographic perfusion (WB-CTP) in small ischemic brain infarctions and to identify factors influencing the detection rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Out of a retrospective cohort of 1380 subjects who underwent initial WB-CTP because of suspected stroke, we selected all patients with a supratentorial magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed ischemic infarction with a volume of 8 mL or less. Infratentorial lesions were excluded. The study was designed as a case-control study with a ratio of cases to controls with no infarction in follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of 1:3. Two blinded readers independently evaluated 4 different computed tomographic perfusion parameter data sets per subject with respect to the presence and localization of a perfusion deficit. RESULT(S): A total of 113 subjects met the inclusion criteria for the patient group. Overall, WB-CTP reached a sensitivity of 43.4% and a specificity of 92.9%. Among these, cortical infarctions were detected in 31 (69%) of 49 cases, whereas subcortical infarctions were detected only in 18 (28%) of 64 cases (P < 0.05). Mean final infarction diameter (17.3 mm) and volume (1.9 mL) of infarctions detected on CTP were significantly larger than those of infarctions not detected (12.4 mm and 0.8 mL, respectively; P < 0.001). Time from symptom onset did not differ significantly between infarctions that were detected or those that were not (204 vs 189 minutes; P = 0.75). CONCLUSION(S): The detection rate of WB-CTP in small infarctions highly depends on infarction localization and final size, whereas time from symptom onset does not seem to influence diagnostic accuracy.

801,"Cognitive functions in survivors of primary central nervous system lymphoma BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) involves high-dose methotrexate-based (MTX) chemotherapy and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). This combined regimen prolongs patient survival, but also carries a substantial risk for delayed neurotoxicity particularly in the elderly. However, cognitive outcome evaluations have not been included in most clinical trials.OBJECTIVE: To assess cognitive functioning and quality of life in PCNSL survivors treated either with WBRT +/- MTX-based chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone.METHODS: Twenty-eight PCNSL patients in disease remission received a post-treatment baseline neuropsychological evaluation, and a subset of patients were available for an 8-month follow-up evaluation. Assessment of quality of life and extent of white matter disease on MRI were also performed.RESULTS: Patients displayed mild to moderate impairments across several cognitive domains. These were of sufficient severity to reduce quality of life in half of the patient sample. Comparisons according to treatment type revealed more pronounced cognitive impairment, particularly in the memory and attention/executive domains, among patients treated with WBRT +/- chemotherapy. Extent of white matter disease correlated with attention/executive, memory, and language impairment.CONCLUSIONS: PCNSL survivors treated with WBRT +/- chemotherapy displayed more pronounced cognitive dysfunction than patients treated with MTX-based chemotherapy alone.",Excluded

1038,"Respiratory modulation of human autonomic function on Earth KEY POINTS: We studied healthy supine astronauts on Earth with electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial pressure, respiratory carbon dioxide concentrations, breathing depth and sympathetic nerve recordings. The null hypotheses were that heart beat interval fluctuations at usual breathing frequencies are baroreflex mediated, that they persist during apnoea, and that autonomic responses to apnoea result from changes of chemoreceptor, baroreceptor or lung stretch receptor inputs. R-R interval fluctuations at usual breathing frequencies are unlikely to be baroreflex mediated, and disappear during apnoea. The subjects' responses to apnoea could not be attributed to changes of central chemoreceptor activity (hypocapnia prevailed); altered arterial baroreceptor input (vagal baroreflex gain declined and muscle sympathetic nerve burst areas, frequencies and probabilities increased, even as arterial pressure climbed to new levels); or altered pulmonary stretch receptor activity (major breathing frequency and tidal volume changes did not alter vagal tone or sympathetic activity). Apnoea responses of healthy subjects may result from changes of central respiratory motoneurone activity.ABSTRACT: We studied eight healthy, supine astronauts on Earth, who followed a simple protocol: they breathed at fixed or random frequencies, hyperventilated and then stopped breathing, as a means to modulate and expose to view important, but obscure central neurophysiological mechanisms. Our recordings included the electrocardiogram, finger photoplethysmographic arterial pressure, tidal volume, respiratory carbon dioxide concentrations and peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity. Arterial pressure, vagal tone and muscle sympathetic outflow were comparable during spontaneous and controlled-frequency breathing. Compared with spontaneous, 0.1 and 0.05 Hz breathing, however, breathing at usual frequencies (~0.25 Hz) lowered arterial baroreflex gain, and provoked smaller arterial pressure and R-R interval fluctuations, which were separated by intervals that were likely to be too short and variable to be attributed to baroreflex physiology. R-R interval fluctuations at usual breathing frequencies disappear during apnoea, and thus cannot provide evidence for the existence of a central respiratory oscillation. Apnoea sets in motion a continuous and ever changing reorganization of the relations among stimulatory and inhibitory inputs and autonomic outputs, which, in our study, could not be attributed to altered chemoreceptor, baroreceptor, or pulmonary stretch receptor activity. We suggest that responses of healthy subjects to apnoea are driven importantly, and possibly prepotently, by changes of central respiratory motoneurone activity. The companion article extends these observations and asks the question, Might terrestrial responses to our 20 min breathing protocol find expression as long-term neuroplasticity in serial measurements made over 20 days during and following space travel?",Excluded
3207,"Salvage Free Tissue Transfer for Clival Osteoradionecrosis After Repeat Proton Beam Therapy BACKGROUND: Craniocervical junction chordoma treated with surgery and Proton Beam Therapy evolved with Osteonecrosis and CSF leak. As the vascularization of the head was compromised, we harvested an Anterolateral thigh musculofascial flap to seal the leak.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old man presented with a history of chronic headaches and dysarthria with tongue deviation to the right. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion at the craniocervical junction with imaging characteristics compatible with chordoma. Endoscopic endonasal resection was followed by proton beam therapy. Recurrence of the chordoma was subsequently resected via far lateral approach again followed by proton beam therapy accumulating a total dose of 75 Gy. Unfortunately, this led to osteoradionecrosis of the skull base resulting in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak more than 1 year after treatment. After multiple failed attempts to seal the defect using local vascularized tissue and free fat grafts, the defect was reconstructed with a vastus lateralis free tissue transfer. Six weeks later, the flap had mucosalized, the patient was pain free, and there was no evidence of a CSF leak.CONCLUSIONS: In select cases, vascularized free flaps offer a superior reconstruction for osteoradionecrosis because radiotherapy often compromises the blood supply of local tissues.",Excluded
2962,"Acquisition of radioresistance by IL-6 treatment is caused by suppression of oxidative stress derived from mitochondria after gamma-irradiation Interleukin (IL)-6 is a multifunctional cytokine and is one of the radiation-induced bystander factors. This study aimed to clarify the mechanism of acquisition of radioresistance through the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by IL-6. We used a rat glioma cell line (C6) as tumor cells and a rat astrocyte cell line (RNB) as non-tumor cells. Our results showed that the surviving fraction of C6 cells after 6 Gy irradiation was increased by the addition of IL-6, but that this was not the case in RNB cells. In addition, the number of 53BP1 foci in C6 cells at 30 min after gamma-irradiation were decreased by IL-6. Levels of ROS in whole C6 cells, and superoxide in the mitochondria of C6 cells immediately after gamma-irradiation, were reduced by IL-6, but this was not observed in RNB cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential detected by JC-1 in C6 and RNB cells was inhibited by IL-6 alone. Therefore, it was concluded that IL-6 leads specifically to radioresistance in tumor cells by inhibition of increases in ROS after gamma-irradiation.",Included
2480,"Functional interrelationships between dehydrogenases and transaminases in various regions of the rat brain as affected by small doses of gamma-radiation. [Russian] Wistar rats were exposed to 10, 20 and 40 sGy of gamma-irradiation. Maximal activity of 2-oxoglutarate- and succinate dehydrogenases, as well as of aspartate-2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate-2-oxoglutarate in the brain tissue was measured within 30 days after the exposure. Dehydrogenase activity was measured in the brain cortex, limbic system and in the cerebellum; transaminase activity was determined in the brain cortex, diencephalic zone and in the hypophysis. It was found that small doses of irradiation resulted in an oscillating increase of dehydrogenase activity with a decrease of the amplitude by the 30th day of the experiment. As the dose of irradiation increases, the periods of normal activity change into phases of inhibition of dehydrogenase action, the period of oscillations diminishes. Transaminase activity, as a rule, changes in a phase in a reversible manner as compared with dehydrogenase activity. These observations are discussed from the point of view of structural relations between these two systems in the intramitochondrial supramolecular structures, the so-called metabolons.",Included
1404,"The medial septum mediates impairment of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle induced by a hippocampal seizure or phencyclidine The involvement of the septohippocampal system on the impaired sensorimotor gating induced by phencyclidine (PCP) or by an electrically induced hippocampal seizure was examined in behaving rats. An impaired sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, was observed following a hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) or systemic injection of PCP and was accompanied with an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30-70 Hz). The medial septum infusion with muscimol (0.25 microg), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, 15 min prior to PCP or a hippocampal AD, prevented the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in gamma waves. By itself, muscimol (0.25 microg) injection into the medial septum did not affect PPI, although it significantly suppressed spontaneous gamma waves. In order to identify subpopulations of neurons mediating the sensorimotor gating deficit and the hippocampal gamma wave increase, 0.14-0.21 microg of p75 antibody conjugated to saporin (192 IgG-saporin) was injected into the medial septum to selectively lesion the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Neither the PPI deficit nor the gamma wave increase induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD was affected by 192 IgG-saporin lesion of the medial septum. It is concluded that increase in neural activity in the medial septum participates in the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD. It is suggested that the GABAergic but not the cholinergic septohippocampal neurons mediate the sensorimotor gating deficit.",Excluded

To characterize the difference of Ku70 distribution between cells of human tissues and cultured cells, the expression of Ku70 was examined in various normal and neoplastic human tissues by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot. In addition, the role of Ku70 in the cellular response against ionizing radiation (IR) was analysed in fibroblasts after exposure to 5 Gy IR and apoptotic indices were examined in Ku70-overexpressed fibroblasts from an ataxia telangiectasia patient and in normal fibroblasts, before and after irradiation. In contrast to cultured cells, Ku70 was not detected in some interphase cells of human tissues and was distributed heterogeneously, even in the same nucleus. Ku70 expression was strikingly low in terminally differentiated cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, glomerular capillary endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and was absent in spermatids. In spermatocytes, Ku70 was tightly integrated with chromosome filaments, unlike other somatic cells under mitosis. After exposure to IR, Ku70 expression was not increased in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts, but was significantly increased in normal fibroblasts. Most of the increased Ku70 was of soluble nuclear protein fraction. Furthermore, overexpression of Ku70 increased radiation resistance both in ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts. The presented data indicate that the distribution of Ku70 in cells of human tissues is closely associated with the cell cycle, cellular differentiation, nuclear shape and the process of repair of DNA damage caused by IR.",Excluded
797,"Locomotion and eating behavior changes in Yucatan minipigs after unilateral radio-induced ablation of the caudate nucleus The functional roles of the Caudate nucleus (Cd) are well known. Selective Cd lesions can be found in neurological disorders. However, little is known about the dynamics of the behavioral changes during progressive Cd ablation. Current stereotactic radiosurgery technologies allow the progressive ablation of a brain region with limited adverse effects in surrounding normal tissues. This could be of high interest for the study of the modified behavioral functions in relation with the degree of impairment of the brain structures. Using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy combined with synchrotron microbeam radiation, we investigated, during one year after irradiation, the effects of unilateral radio-ablation of the right Cd on the behavior of Yucatan minipigs. The right Cd was irradiated to a minimal dose of 35.5 Gy delivered in three fractions. MRI-based morphological brain integrity and behavioral functions, i.e. locomotion, motivation/hedonism were assessed. We detected a progressive radio-necrosis leading to a quasi-total ablation one year after irradiation, with an additional alteration of surrounding areas. Transitory changes in the motivation/hedonism were firstly detected, then on locomotion, suggesting the influence of different compensatory mechanisms depending on the functions related to Cd and possibly some surrounding areas. We concluded that early behavioral changes related to eating functions are relevant markers for the early detection of ongoing lesions occurring in Cd-related neurological disorders.",Included

This U.S. National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) analysis was performed to improve the evidence guiding decision-making regarding postoperative therapy for early stage LCNEC. Method(s): Overall survival of patients with pathologic T1-2aN0 LCNEC who underwent resection in the NCDB from 2003 to 2015 was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis. Patients who died within 30 days of surgery were excluded. These prospective data were acquired by certified tumor registrars, and include over 80% of cancer diagnoses annually in the U.S. Result(s): Of the 5,177 patients who met study criteria, adjuvant therapy was given to 31% of patients (n=1585): 20% received chemotherapy (n=1039), 8% chemoradiation (n=400), and 3% radiation (n=146).

Acupuncture analgesia has been confirmed by numerous clinical observations and experimental studies to be a useful treatment to release different kinds of pains, including inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia. However, the underlying mechanisms of the analgesic effect of acupuncture are not fully understood. In the present study, using a rat model of inflammatory pain induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), we observed the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on animal behavior with regard to pain and the expression of a subunit of NMDA receptor (NR1) and isolectin B4 (IB4) in the neurons of the lumbar DRG. Intraplantar injection of 50 microl CFA resulted in considerable changes in thermal hyperalgesia, edema of the hind paw and ""foot-bend"" score, beginning 5 h post-injection and persisting for a few days, after which a gradual recovery occurred. The changes were attenuated by EA treatment received on the ipsilateral ""Huan Tiao"" and ""Yang Ling Quan"" once a day from the first day post-injection of CFA. Using an immunofluorescence double staining, we found that the number of double-labeled cells to the total number of the IB4 and NR1-labeled neurons increased significantly on days 3 and 7 after CFA injection. The change was attenuated by EA treatment. These results suggest that EA affects the progress of experimental inflammatory pain by modulating the expression of NMDA receptors in primary sensory neurons, in particular, IB4-positive small neurons.",Excluded

99,"Lower stimulation frequency can enhance tolerability and efficacy of pallidal deep brain stimulation for dystonia We report the case of a patient with medically refractory primary dystonia who was treated with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation. Stimulation at 130 Hz or higher, by means of the more ventral contacts generated capsular side effects, which made their use impractical. Consequently, the patient was treated for 9 months at 130 to 185 Hz, by means of the more dorsal contacts, achieving modest results. By reducing the stimulation frequency to 80 Hz, we were able to activate the ventral contacts without inducing side effects. Within days, the patient experienced a dramatic improvement in function that has persisted for 1 year. A further reduction in stimulation frequency to 60 Hz resulted in a worsening of his symptoms. We conclude that chronic stimulation at frequencies of <100 Hz may be efficacious in dystonia and may enhance the tolerability of stimulation by means of contacts that are positioned posteroventrally within the internal globus pallidus, nearer the internal capsule.",Excluded

Neck irradiation and radiotherapy-induced arteritis are common indications. The clinical outcomes of CAS for radiation arteritis have been poorly defined.METHODS: A prospective database of patients undergoing CAS at a tertiary referral academic medical center was maintained from 1999 to 2006. Patients undergoing primary carotid artery stenting for significant atherosclerotic (ASOD) and radiotherapy (XRT)-induced occlusive disease were analyzed. Life-table analyses were performed to assess time-dependent outcomes. Cox proportional hazard analysis or Fisher's exact test was performed to identify factors associated with outcomes. Data are presented as the mean +/- SEM unless otherwise indicated.RESULTS: During the study period, 150 patients underwent primary CAS, 75% with embolic protection. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. One hundred twenty-seven (85%) were treated for ASOD, and 23 (15%) had XRT. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 1% for ASOD and 0% for XRT (P = NS); overall survival at 3 years was equivalent. There was no significant difference in major adverse event rates as defined by the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial between the groups. The 3-year neurologic event-free rate was 85% for ASOD and 87% for XRT (P = NS). Late asymptomatic occlusions were seen only in XRT patients. The 3-year freedom from restenosis rate was significantly worse for the XRT group, at 20%, vs 74% for the ASOD group (P < .05). Likewise, the 3-year patency rate was also worse for the XRT group, at 91%, vs 100% for ASOD by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < .05). No factor was predictive of occlusion or stenosis by Cox proportional hazards analysis.CONCLUSION: CAS for radiation arteritis has poor long-term anatomic outcome and can present with late asymptomatic occlusions.

774,"Chemical basis of reactive oxygen species reactivity and involvement in neurodegenerative diseases Increasing numbers of individuals suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by progressive loss of neurons. Oxidative stress, in particular, the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), play an important role in the development of these diseases, as evidenced by the detection of products of lipid, protein and DNA oxidation in vivo. Even if they participate in cell signaling and metabolism regulation, ROS are also formidable weapons against most of the biological materials because of their intrinsic nature. By nature too, neurons are particularly sensitive to oxidation because of their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, weak antioxidant defense and high oxygen consumption. Thus, the overproduction of ROS in neurons appears as particularly deleterious and the mechanisms involved in oxidative degradation of biomolecules are numerous and complexes. This review highlights the production and regulation of ROS, their chemical properties, both from kinetic and thermodynamic points of view, the links between them, and their implication in neurodegenerative diseases.

We found classical practice effects in the iTBS and the sham group: WM performance improved following stimulation as measured by the discriminability index. However, this effect could not be observed in the cTBS group. We did not find any hemisphere-dependent effects, suggesting that the practice effect is not lateralized, and TBS affects WM performance in a comparable manner if administered either over the left or the right hemisphere. We propose that our findings represent a useful addition to the literature of TBS-induced effects on WM.

630,"The role of the mammalian DNA end-processing enzyme polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 pathogenesis DNA strand-breaks (SBs) with non-ligatable ends are generated by ionizing radiation, oxidative stress, various chemotherapeutic agents, and also as base excision repair (BER) intermediates. Several neurological diseases have already been identified as being due to a deficiency in DNA end-processing activities. Two common dirty ends, 3'-P and 5'-OH, are processed by mammalian polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a bifunctional enzyme with 3'-phosphatase and 5'-kinase activities. We have made the unexpected observation that PNKP stably associates with Ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a polyglutamine repeat-containing protein mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD). This disease is one of the most common dominantly inherited ataxias worldwide; the defect in SCA3 is due to CAG repeat expansion (from the normal 14-41 to 55-82 repeats) in the ATXN3 coding region. However, how the expanded form gains its toxic function is still not clearly understood. Here we report that purified wild-type (WT) ATXN3 stimulates, and by contrast the mutant form specifically inhibits, PNKP's 3' phosphatase activity in vitro. ATXN3-deficient cells also show decreased PNKP activity. Furthermore, transgenic mice conditionally expressing the pathological form of human ATXN3 also showed decreased 3'-phosphatase activity of PNKP, mostly in the deep cerebellar nuclei, one of the most affected regions in MJD patients' brain. Finally, long amplicon quantitative PCR analysis of human MJD patients' brain samples showed a significant accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Our results thus indicate that the accumulation of DNA strand breaks due to functional deficiency of PNKP is etiologically linked to the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD.",Excluded
324,"Prediction of radiation necrosis in a rodent model using magnetic resonance imaging apparent transverse relaxation ([Formula: see text]) BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation necrosis remains an irreversible long-term side-effect following radiotherapy to the brain. The ability to predict areas that could ultimately develop into necrosis could lead to prevention and management of radiation necrosis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fischer 344 rats were irradiated using two platforms (micro-CT irradiator and x-Rad 225 IGRT) with radiation up to 30 Gy for the micro-CT and 40 Gy for the xRAD-224 to half the brain. Animals were subsequently imaged using a 9.4 T MRI scanner every 2-4 weeks for up to 28 weeks using a 7-echo gradient echo sequence. The apparent transverse relaxation constant ([Formula: see text]) was calculated and retrospectively analyzed.RESULTS: Animals irradiated with the low-dose rate micro-CT did not exhibit any symptoms or imaging changes associated with RN. Animals irradiated with the xRAD-225 exhibited imaging changes consistent with RN at week 24. Analysis of the [Formula: see text] coefficient within the lesion and hippocampus shows the potential for detection of RN up to 10 weeks prior to morphological changes.CONCLUSIONS: The ability to predict areas of RN and increases of [Formula: see text] within the hippocampus provides a method for long-term monitoring and prediction of RN.",Included

[Spanish] AIMS: To evaluate the survival rates, prognostic factors and adverse events in patients with pituitary adenomas following fractionated stereotactic-guided radiotherapy (FSRT). MATERIAL AND METHODS. Fifty-six patients with pituitary adenomas were treated with FSRT; 23 patients (41.1%) had primary adenomas, 33 had recurrent disease; 24 (42.9%) with non-functional and 32 (57.1%) with functional adenomas. Using conventional fractionation, median total dose administered was 54 Gy (range: 24-56 Gy). RESULTS. The median follow-up was 51 months (range: 9-102) and, at the time of analysis, 49 patients were alive and disease-free, 1 patient was alive with reduced visual acuity and biochemical indications of recurrence, 2 patients had died from the disease and 1 patient had died from unrelated causes. Overall survival was 94% (50/53) and overall local tumour control was 92% (49/53). Univariate analysis indicated hormonal secretion (ACTH) and previous radiotherapy as being statistically significant. Fourteen patients (25%) had minor side-effects during treatment and 3 patients (5.4%) had late-onset events; 2 with optical neuropathy (both patients had other relevant co-existing diseases) and 1 patient had brain necrosis (re-irradiation). CONCLUSION. Fractionated stereotactic-guided radiotherapy is an effective modality for the treatment of pituitary adenomas. Care is required in patients with co-morbidities and/or previously-irradiated recurrent tumour so as to minimise late-onset secondary effects.",Excluded

918,"Effects of the memory enhancer linopirdine (Dup 996) on cerebral glucose metabolism in naive and hypoxia-exposed rats Linopirdine [DuP 996; 3,3-bis(4-pyrindinylmethyl)-1-phenylindolin-2-one] represents a novel class of compounds which enhance depolarization-activated (but not basal) release of acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin in brain slices and improve learning and memory in rodents. The effects of linopiridine on local cerebral glucose metabolism were studied by the quantitative autoradiographic 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose method. Linopirdine administration in naive rats (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) did not significantly alter cerebral glucose metabolism in any of the regions analyzed. Since linopirdine protects against hypoxia-induced passive avoidance deficits in rats, we also examined the effects of linopirdine on cerebral metabolism after the rats were exposed to 30 min of hypoxia. Glucose metabolism was not significantly altered after hypoxic exposure, except for a small increase in some brain regions. Linopirdine administered after hypoxia decreased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus, limbic cortex, ventral hippocampal commissure, medial septum, striatum, subthalamic nucleus, zona incerta, lateral habenula, cerebral cortex, cerebellar vermis and a few thalamic nuclei. Statistically significant effects of linopirdine on glucose metabolism were observed in 22 of 56 brain regions sampled. In hypoxia-exposed rats, linopirdine altered glucose metabolism in brain regions that are implicated in learning and memory and are affected in Alzheimer's disease. Several of the affected regions are associated with the cholinergic system and may play a role in the cognitive enhancing properties of linopirdine.",Excluded
735,"Hypo-fractionated IMRT for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: a 6 year single institutional experience OBJECTIVES: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults. Surgery and radiotherapy constitute the cornerstones for the therapeutic management of GBM. The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol. Despite the progress in neurosurgery, radiotherapy and oncology, the prognosis still results poor. In order to reduce the long time of standard treatment, maintaining or improving the clinical results, in our institute we have investigated the effects of hypo-fractionated radiation therapy for patients with GBM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients affected by GBM who had previously undergone surgical resection (total, subtotal or biopsy) were enrolled between October 2005 and December 2011 in a single institutional study of hypo-fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) followed or not by adjuvant chemotherapy with TMZ (6-12 cycles). The most important eligibility criteria were: biopsy-proven GBM, KPS >= 60, age >= 18 years, no previous brain irradiation, informed consensus. Hypo-fractionated IMRT was delivered to a total dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions prescribed to 70% isodose. Response to treatment, OS, PFS, toxicity and patterns of recurrence were evaluated, and sex, age, type of surgery, Karnofsky performance status, Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification, time between surgery and initiation of radiotherapy were evaluated as potential prognostic factors for survival.RESULTS: All patients have completed the treatment protocol. Median age was 64.5 years (range 41-82 years) with 31 females (46%) and 36 males (54%). Median KPS at time of treatment was 80. The surgery was gross total in 38 patients and subtotal in 14 patients; 15 patients underwent only biopsy. No grade 3-4 acute or late neurotoxicity was observed. With median follow-up of 14.9 months, the median OS and PFS were 13.4 and 7.9 months, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The hypo-fractionated radiation therapy can be used for patients with GBM, resulting in favourable overall survival, low rates of toxicity and satisfying QoL.

A secondary aim was to investigate the relationship between acoustic and perceptual measures.METHODS: In total, 37 patients received voice rehabilitation post-radiotherapy and 37 patients constituted the irradiated control group. Outcome measures were mean CPPS for connected speech and ratings with the auditory-perceptual Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia and Strain (GRBAS) scale. Outcome measures were analyzed 1 (baseline), 6, 12, and 24 months post-radiotherapy, where voice rehabilitation was conducted between the first two time-points. Additional recordings were acquired from vocally healthy participants for comparison.RESULTS: CPPS values of the voice rehabilitation group and vocally healthy group were not significantly different at 24 months post-radiotherapy. Ten out of 19 patients who received voice rehabilitation yielded a CPPS value above the threshold for normal voice 24 months post-radiotherapy, compared to 11 out of 26 in the irradiated control group. No statistically significant correlations were found between CPPS and perceptual parameters of GRBAS.CONCLUSION: Voice rehabilitation for irradiated laryngeal cancer patients may have positive effects on voice quality up to 24 months post-radiotherapy.

1731,"Prospective study of fatigue in localized prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy The objectives were to (1) prospectively evaluate fatigue utilizing validated instruments in patients with localized prostate cancer, and (2) examine the relationships between fatigue, depression, quality of life, and sleep disturbance. The instruments used included: Piper Fatigue Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate Scale. Data on cancer stage, prostate specific antigen levels, hematocrit, patient's body weight and radiation dosage were recorded. Patients were evaluated preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy, and at 4-5 weeks follow-up. Thirty-six veterans with localized prostate cancer were studied. Mean age was 66.9 years (range 55-79). Duration of treatment was 7-8 weeks. Univariate procedure and Wilcoxon Signed Rank-test were used to examine changes in pretreatment scores for each of the three subsequent study periods. To adjust for multiple comparisons Bonferroni test was used. Spearman Correlations were calculated among parameters. No significant changes were noted in mean scores of hematocrit and body weight during the study period. On the Piper Fatigue Scale, adjusted for multiple comparisons, the median scores were significantly higher at completion of radiotherapy as compared with preradiotherapy values. Three patients (8%) were experienced fatigue according to Piper Fatigue Scale before treatment as compared to nine patients (25%) at completion of radiotherapy. On Prostate Cancer Specific and Physical Well Being subscales of the Functional Assessment for Prostate Cancer Therapy, the scores were significantly lower at middle and completion of radiotherapy than at pretreatment. At preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy and follow-up evaluation, patients scoring higher on the Piper Fatigue Scale were more likely to report a poorer quality of Physical Well Being on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostates. No significant changes were noted in the Beck Depression Inventory and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores during treatment. Eight patients scored 10 or more on the Beck Depression Inventory before starting radiotherapy, suggesting depressive symptomatology. Of these, only seven patients scored 10 or more at completion of treatment. The incidence of fatigue is lower in our study than in previously published data. A relationship exists between fatigue scores and physical well being subscale scores. Higher scores on the Piper Fatigue Scale at the completion of radiotherapy, as well as no changes on depression and sleepiness scales, suggest that fatigue may not be the result of depression or sleep disturbance. Based upon our previous work, we propose that the physical expression of fatigue may be secondary to a decline in neuromuscular efficiency and enhanced muscle fatigue.",Excluded

We sought to explore this phenomenon in a systematic fashion by evaluating melanoma patients with brain metastases who were treated with both radiation and ipilimumab. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of sixteen consecutive patients who received ipilimumab and 51 courses of braindirected radiation at a single institution from 2008 to 2013. We examined responses of the largest ""index"" extra-cranial lesion after 31 of these courses where imaging was available before and after treatment and compared this response to two consecutive studies performed prior to radiation therapy when available. Overall survival was calculated from the last day of the first brain-directed radiation therapy course using the Kaplan-Meier method. Responses before and after radiation therapy were compared using McNemar's and the binomial tests for clustered data. Twogroup exact tests for clustered data were used to explore the impact of treatment timing on response. Result(s): Median survival after initial radiation was 14 months, with maximum survival of 50 months. After radiation therapy, the largest index extra-cranial lesion shrank in 35% of 31 instances with sequential imaging as compared to a 17% favorable response rate in the 25 instances with two scans prior to radiation (p = 0.20). There was also a 2.8-fold increased likelihood that the kinetics of index lesion response improved following radiation therapy that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). Index lesions were more likely to respond when ipilimumab was administered within three months of radiation (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Historical series of melanoma patients with brain metastases describe median survival of less than 6 months, and less than 4 months in patients treated with radiation therapy without surgery for these lesions. Our data suggest patients treated with ipilimumab and radiation therapy may fare better than these historical controls. There was a trend for favorable systemic response following radiation therapy worthy of further evaluation in studies powered to detect potential synergies between radiation and immunotherapy.",Excluded

Conformational and functional consequences of Cu(2+)-binding to prion protein (PrP) are not well understood largely because most of the Cu(2+)-binding studies have been performed on fragments and truncated variants of the prion protein. In this context, we set out to investigate the conformational consequences of Cu(2+)-binding to full-length prion protein (PrP) by isothermal calorimetry, NMR, and small angle x-ray scattering. In this study, we report altered aggregation behavior of full-length PrP upon binding to Cu(2+). At physiological temperature, Cu(2+) did not promote aggregation suggesting that Cu(2+) may not play a role in the aggregation of PrP at physiological temperature (37 degreeC). However, Cu(2+)-bound PrP aggregated at lower temperatures. This temperature-dependent process is reversible. Our results show two novel intra-protein interactions upon Cu(2+)-binding. The N-terminal region (residues 90-120 that contain the site His-96/His-111) becomes proximal to helix-1 (residues 144-147) and its nearby loop region (residues 139-143), which may be important in preventing amyloid fibril formation in the presence of Cu(2+). In addition, we observed another novel interaction between the N-terminal region comprising the octapeptide repeats (residues 60-91) and helix-2 (residues 174-185) of PrP. Small angle x-ray scattering studies of full-length PrP show significant compactness upon Cu(2+)-binding. Our results demonstrate novel long range inter-domain interactions of the N- and C-terminal regions of PrP upon Cu(2+)-binding, which might have physiological significance.",Excluded

Efficacy of the combination treatment was assessed by evaluation of mortality, as well as by histologic examination of the brain, testis, bone marrow, heart and spleen. The combination of relatively low doses of interleukin-1 alpha (700 U) with thymopentin yielded a survival which was nearly that observed with interleukin-1 alpha (1000 U) given alone (about 100%). The optimal effect was observed in animals treated for 15 days with thymopentin, either in combination or alone.

However, the role of non-coding RNA and mRNA in radiation protection, especially in the nervous system, remains unknown. In this study, microarray profiles were used to determine microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of mice that were pretreated with amifostine and subsequently exposed to high-dose IR. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed. We found that fewer miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs were induced by amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice, which exhibited antagonistic effects compared to IR, indicating that amifostine attenuated the IR-induced effects on RNA profiles. GO and KEGG pathway analyses showed changes in a variety of signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses during radioprotection following amifostine pre-treatment in exposed mice. Taken together, our study revealed that amifostine treatment altered or attenuated miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of exposed mice.

Lu177 therapy is logistically different than any other currently used radionuclide therapeutic agent. We aim to present a technologist's perspective on potential challenges related to the implementation of Lu177 therapy including developing an institution's policy, identifying needed location/space, supplies, and staff requirements. Method(s): A Lu177 treatment regimen consists of 4 intravenous infusions of 200 mCi at 8 week intervals. Each therapeutic infusion is 4-6 hours, consists of the Lu177 infusion along with an infusion of amino acids and requires nursing supervision. During this process, to reduce radiation exposure, the patient must walk to the restroom every thirty minutes with an IV pole to void. The technologists met with the Authorized Users (AU), the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), and the other staff involved to review the requirements of radiation safety, workflow, and protocol of this therapy. Result(s): The radioactive materials license is to be amended. It was determined that Lu177 administration would ideally occur in our PET division due to department layout and patient flow. While the general nuclear medicine department has an injection room suited for therapeutic use, the restroom is not in close proximity, which is a radiation safety concern. In our PET center, there are 2 comfortable injection rooms used for long uptake periods located next to a restroom dedicated for radioactive patients. Due to the stated length of the Lu177 therapy session, the PET diagnostic schedule will be reduced on Lu177 therapy days. Lu177 therapies will be scheduled in coordination with other departments including oncology; pharmacy for obtaining amino acids; and nursing for the administration of IV fluids and vital sign monitoring. After the infusion is completed and the injection room is cleaned, radioactive waste will be moved to long term storage. Conclusion(s): Lu177 therapy is an exciting new development in the field of radionuclide therapy: however, its implementation brings new challenges to meet both radiation safety and protocol requirements.

Heavy ion RT has been used in the treatment of various tumours, especially for radioresistant tumours mediated by hypoxia, localized near organs at risk. Most of these treatments are concentrated in deep-seated tumours such as those of the brain, head, lung, liver, rectum and urogenital organs, and treatment of skin carcinomas is limited.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcome and toxicity after carbon ion RT for skin carcinomas at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou, China.METHODS: Between November 2006 and March 2009, 45 patients with skin carcinoma [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n = 16), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (n = 12), malignant melanoma (MM) (n = 7), Bowen disease (n = 8) and Paget disease (n = 2)] were treated with carbon ion RT within a clinical Phase I trial. Patients received total doses of 60-70 GyE for SCC and BCC, 61-75 GyE for MM, 60 GyE for Bowen disease and 42.5 GyE for Paget disease, administered in 6-11 fractions over 6-11 days, with a fraction dose of 7-10 GyE.RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 24 months, range 12-36 months.

To confirm the effect of this approach, we analyzed more patients with long term follow up. Materials/Methods: From January 1992 to Dec 2003, 222 patients (74 T3 and 148 T4 NPC) were treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and concomitant chemotherapy (CCT). HFRT was administered at 1.2 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day, Monday-Friday for 62 fractions for a total dose of 74.4 Gy. Concomitant chemotherapy consisting of cis-diamino-dichloroplatinum (CDDP) alone or CDDP and 5-fluorouracil were delivered simultaneously with radiotherapy during Weeks 1 and 6. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of CDDP and 5-fluorouracil for 2 to 3 cycles and was given monthly beginning 1 month after completion of radiation. Result(s):With a median follow-up of 102 months (range: 5 - 186 months), the 5-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 81.9%, 78.5%, 65.5% and 73.6%, respectively. At 10 years, the 10-year locoregional control rate, distant-metastasis free, disease-free and overall survivals were 76.7%, 75.5%, 60.5% and 64.2%, respectively.

The aim of the present study was to test the tolerance to a whole brain telegammatherapy with a daily dose of 2 Gy in patients with lung cancer, to evaluate the improvement of sensory and motor deficits, and to define the more appropriate total dose (20 or 30 Gy) with regard to the patient survival.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty nine patients with lung cancer and verified brain metastases underwent a whole brain telegammatherapy to a total dose of 20-30 Gy. Solitary metastases were found in 45 percent of the patients but all were defined as inoperable cases. The other patients had two or more brain lesions.RESULTS: All patients tolerated well the fraction and the total dose. The mean survival of the patients was 6.6 months with confidence interval 5.8-7.4 months. The survival difference between treatments with 20 and 30 Gy total dose did not reach statistical significance. Significant improvement was found in the Karnofsky index, intracranial pressure, headache, and neurologic symptoms after radiotherapy.CONCLUSION: Radiation therapy in patients with brain metastases from lung cancer is well tolerated and improves the quality of life.",Excluded
2147,"YKL-40 expression is associated with poorer response to radiation and shorter overall survival in glioblastoma PURPOSE: YKL-40 is a secreted protein that has been reported to be overexpressed in epithelial cancers and gliomas, although its function is unknown. Previous data in a smaller sample set suggested that YKL-40 was a marker associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a genetically defined subgroup of glioblastoma. Here we test these findings in a larger series of patients with glioblastoma, and in particular, determine if tumor YKL-40 expression is associated with radiation response.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=147) with subtotal resections were studied for imaging-assessed changes in tumor size in serial studies following radiation therapy. An additional set (n=140) of glioblastoma patients who underwent a gross-total resection was tested to validate the survival association and extend them to patients with minimal residual disease.RESULTS: In the subtotal resection group, higher YKL-40 expression was significantly associated with poorer radiation response, shorter time to progression and shorter overall survival. The association of higher YKL-40 expression with poorer survival was validated in the gross-total resection group. In multivariate analysis with both groups combined (n = 287), YKL-40 was an independent predictor of survival after adjusting for patient age, performance status, and extent of resection. YKL-40 expression was also compared with genetically defined subsets of glioblastoma by assessing epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and loss at chromosome 10q, two of the common recurring aberrations in these tumors, using fluorescent in situ hybridization. YKL-40 was significantly associated with 10q loss.CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate YKL-40 as an important marker of therapeutic response and genetic subtype in glioblastomas and suggest that it may play an oncogenic role in these tumors.",Included
1047,"Disruption of the prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex in vasopressin V1b receptor knockout mice: reversal by antipsychotic drugs In the present study, we investigated whether mice lacking the arginine vasopressin (AVP) V1b receptor (V1bR) exhibit deficits of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, reminiscent of the sensorimotor gating deficits observed in a large majority of schizophrenic patients. V1bR knockout (KO) mice displayed significantly reduced levels of PPI of the startle reflex. In addition to PPI deficits, V1bR KO mice showed increased acoustic startle response. However, acoustic startle response was not significantly correlated to the PPI of the startle reflex in V1bR KO mice. V1bR KO mice also showed a decrease in basal levels of extracellular dopamine (DA) in the medial prefrontal cortex, which is thought to be an important brain region for PPI. Moreover, PPI deficits observed in the V1bR KO mice are significantly reversed by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and clozapine but not by a typical neuroleptic haloperidol, like in schizophrenic patients. By contrast, we did not observe any significant differences between V1bR KO mice and wild-type mice in the open-field, light/dark, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming tests. The results of the present study indicate that V1bR may be involved in the regulation of PPI of the startle reflex. The V1bR has been considered an important molecular target for the development of antipsychotic drugs.",Excluded
339,"Advanced radiation therapy plan for glm based on FMRI Purpose: Following radical radiotherapy (RT), high graDe gliomas such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) frequently recur within the high dose volume and it is plausible that conventional planning margins might be reduced without a loss of local tumour control. Akin to the current evaluation of reduction in the dose delivered to the hippocampal and limbic systems to reduce radiationrelated memory impairment, other uninvolved critical functional cerebral areas should be spared to minimise the potential acute and late toxicities of radiation therapy. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of speech centre localisation using functional MRI (fMRI) on the RT planning process in GBM. Materials: Language function was activated in a 68-year old male with a right fronto-parietal GBM using a 'word generation' task. Block designed blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI was applied (1.5 T Siemens Avanto scanner) during lingual stimulation [1]. BOLD-clusters were assessed individually for anatomical localization. fMRI was performed using EPI sequence and T1-weighted anatomical 3D VIBE sequence was used for functional image analysis and overlay [1]. The functional image analysis and overlay procedures were performed using BrainVoyager (BrainInnovationBV, Maastricht, The Netherlands). A CT scan (Siemens Open Sensation) was performed to delineate the radiation target volume and organs at risk (OAR) (Fig 1A). The fusion of the 3-D anatomical and functional datasets (CT+fMRI) as well as the segmentation of the radiation target volume was achieved using Siemens Oncology workstation (Fig. 1B). The speech centres were defined as OARs in the IMRT planning process (mean 45 Gy, max. 50 Gy) (Fig. 1C). The treatment plan (Pinnacle 8.0m TPS, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) was not used clinically and the patient was informed. Result(s): Speech activation areas and the GBM (as defined on the T1 MRI images) could be visualised separately. The plan did not compromise any other constraint and spared the critical structures. The mean and maximum doses to the PTV (60 Gy prescribed to 100%) were 61.97 Gy and 69.47 Gy respectively. Broca's area was partially within the PTV, however the mean and maximum doses to Wernicke's area were 36 Gy and 52.81 Gy (Fig. 1C). Figure 1. A) CT scan, B) Broca's and Wernicke's areas as detected by fMRI and C) axial slice through radiation treatment plan. (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): Our 3-D CT/fMRI fusion protocol provides a method to localise the speech centres and thus to define them as OARs for clinical radiotherapy planning. This novel technique enables the first steps towards the individualisation of radiotherapy treatment planning for selected patients with glioma, where the tumour does not overlap the speech areas.",Excluded
2722,"Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ameliorates radiation-induced ototoxicity in zebrafish and cochlea-derived cell lines Radiation is a widely used treatment for head and neck cancers, and one of its most severe side effects is ototoxicity. Radiation-induced ototoxicity has been demonstrated to be linked to the increased production of ROS and MAPK. We intended to investigate the effect of p38 inhibition on radiation-induced ototoxicity in cochlea-derived HEI-OC1 cells and in a zebrafish model. The otoprotective effect of p38 inhibition against radiation was tested in vitro in the organ of Corti-derived cell line, HEI-OC1, and in vivo in a zebrafish model. Radiation-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an increase of intracellular NO generation were demonstrated in HEI-OC1 cells. The p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, ameliorated radiation-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial injury in HEI-OC1 cells. p38 inhibition reduced radiation-induced activation of JNK, p38, cytochrome c, and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in HEI-OC1 cells. Scanning electron micrography showed that SB203580 prevented radiation-induced destruction of kinocilium and stereocilia in zebrafish neuromasts. The results of this study suggest that p38 plays an important role in mediating radiation-induced ototoxicity and inhibition of p38 could be a plausible option for preventing radiation ototoxicity.",Included
2145,"Recurrent breast cancer involving the brachial plexus identified by FDG PET/CT Purpose: Identifying malignant involvement of the brachial plexus in breast cancer patients is challenging from both a clinical and an imaging perspective. We evaluated the ability of PET/CT to detect malignant involvement of the brachial plexus in patients with a prior history of breast cancer. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients presenting with neuropathy and a prior history who underwent a FDG PET/CT scan from 9/01/05 to 9/01/09 was undertaken. Patients were included if the neurologic examination documented a regional pain syndrome, motor abnormalities or sensory deficits and PET/CT was ordered within 1 month of presentation. Brachial plexus involvement was confirmed by biopsy and/or resolved with cancer treatment. The location of brachial plexus involvement and other sites of disease identified on PET/CT were correlated to the pathologic results and clinical outcome. Result(s): Arm pain or peripheral neuropathy led to PT/CT evaluation in 81 patients (mean age 67.3+/-9.6) who had subsequently biopsy or clinical follow-up. FDG uptake indicative of recurrent malignancy was identified in the brachial plexus on PET/CT scans in 66 patients (81.5%). Forty-three patients had biopsy confirmation and the rest demonstrated resolution on PET/CT following treatment. The linear FDG uptake within the thicken plexus ranged from mild to intense (SUVmax= 2.1-12.3; mean 5.6). In 3 patients discontinuous plexus involvement was seen and confirmed by biopsy as skip lesions. In all but 5 patients, the brachial plexus was the only site of breast cancer recurrence identified on PET/CT. In the 15 PET/CT negative patients, 12 had positive MR. Biopsy or clinical follow-up determined that these 12 patients did not have brachial plexus disease but MR signal abnormalities were due to from post-treatment radiation or surgical changes. Conclusion(s): PET/CT readily detects breast cancer involvement in the brachial plexus in presenting with upper extremity symptoms. FDG PET/CT was able to differentiate an active tumor from post-treatment changes.",Excluded
1308,"Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound for unilateral thalamotomy in medication refractory essential tremor Introduction: Essential Tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and is associated with significant functional impairment and disability. Ablative and stimulation-based surgical treatments have been developed to treat the significant number of patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical management. Although often providing effective tremor control, current surgical options have risks associated with intracranial procedures, as well as issues of durability and predictability of treatment response. Here, we explore the application of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) as an alternative, non-invasive means of generating thalamic lesions in patients with treatment-resistant ET. Method(s): Four patients underwent awake MRgFUS thalamotomy for refractory essential tremor (mean age 70.8; mean duration of illness 17.8 years). Diagnosis of refractory ET was confirmed by a movement disorder neurologist, and patients underwent baseline medical and imaging investigations prior to treatment. Tremor assessments and serial structural imaging were performed at 1, 7, 30 and 90 days following the procedure. Result(s): All four patients experienced immediate and sustained improvements in their dominant (treated) hand tremor (Figure 1). At 1- and 3-months following treatment, dominant hand tremor scores were reduced by a mean of 89% and 78%, respectively, on part A of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. Functional impairment decreased significantly at 3-months, with patients reporting improvements in writing, drinking and eating. There were no serious adverse events, with only one patient reporting persistent lip and finger paraesthesias at 3-months. Conclusion(s): MRgFUS appears to be a safe and effective means of non-invasively generating thalamic lesions for the relief of refractory ET. This technology is a promising alternative to radiation- and surgical-based approaches to lesional functional neurosurgery, but requires larger trials with more patients to verify its efficacy.

2007,"Chemoradiotherapy for primary CNS lymphoma: an intent-to-treat analysis with complete follow-up OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of a preradiation chemotherapy regimen in patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), with emphasis on long-term outcomes.METHODS: In this prospective phase II trial, patients with a new diagnosis of PCNSL received two cycles of intrathecal (12 mg) and IV (1 g/m2) methotrexate (MTX), thiotepa (30 mg/m2), and procarbazine (75 mg/m2), prior to whole-brain radiotherapy (RT).RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled (ages 26 to 71, median 53). Median Karnofsky performance scale score was 70. After chemotherapy, 7 patients (41%) had a complete response (CR) and 7 (41%) a partial response (PR). After RT, 13 (76%) patients achieved a CR, 2 (12%) a PR, and 2 (12%) had disease progression. Relapse occurred in 7 (41%) patients; median disease-free survival was 18 months. Fifteen (88%) patients have died: 8 (47%) from PCNSL, 5 (29%) from neurotoxicity, and 2 (12%) from unknown causes. Median overall survival was 32 months. Two patients (12%) are alive and disease free at 12 years follow-up. Nephrotoxicity was a minor complication, but grades 3 and 4 myelosuppression were found in 5 (29%) patients.CONCLUSIONS: This regimen resulted in an efficacy and toxicity profile comparable to other combined modality treatments, despite the relatively low dose of methotrexate. It may be a useful option in patients unable to tolerate higher doses. Procarbazine and thiotepa are potential candidates for incorporation into chemotherapy regimens aiming to decrease the incidence of neurotoxicity. First relapse and neurotoxicity within 2 years of diagnosis seem to be critical for predicting long-term outcomes.",Excluded
429,"Neurotransmitter receptors in brain regions of acrylamide-treated rats. II: Effects of extended exposure to acrylamide Acrylamide was administered orally to 6 week old male rats in ten doses, spread over a two week period. At the two lower doses (5 and 10 mg/kg, total dose 50 and 100 mg/kg) effects on neurotransmitter receptor sites appeared confirmed to the striatum where both the dopamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors exhibited enhanced binding twenty four hours after the last acrylamide dose. Other receptor sites within the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and medulla were not significantly altered. At the highest dose (20 mg/kg, given ten times), increases were also found for frontal cortical serotonin, medullary glycine, and cerebellar GABA receptor sites. The only unaffected receptor found was the cortical site for benzodiazepene. One week after the final acrylamide dose, the intensity of all ligands studied was not significantly different in treated and control groups. Thus, effects appeared reversible. Since striatal membrane protein concentration was reduced by treatment with rats with acrylamide, the observed increase in activity of muscarinic receptors could be best accounted for in terms of loss of striatal non-receptor protein rather than increased binding. However, the magnitude of increased striatal <sup>3</sup>H-spiroperidol binding in treated animals suggested an increase in overall binding capacity. An effect on dopamine neutrons was also suggested by a decreased responsiveness to apomorphine in rats treated with acrylamide at 10 mg/kg for 10 successive days; however, the effect had dissipated by 8 days after the final injection of acrylamide.",Excluded
1710,"The effects of the g-quadruplex ligand telomestatin to human brain tumor stem cell survival and growth Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the leading cause of death among primary brain tumors in adults and the current therapies have only palliative effect on prognosis of patients. Recently, stem cell-like cells in GBM (brain tumor stem-like cells; BTSC) have gained substantial attention as a potential therapeutic target. Hallmarks of BTSC include their self-renewal capacity and highly migratory potential. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of patient-derived BTSC with a G-quadruplex ligand, telomestatin (TMS), inhibits BTSC self-renewal and maintenance of their stem cell state, and induces their apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, both normal precursors and non-stem tumor cells from the matched samples are relatively resistant to TMS treatment. Treatment with a lower dose of TMS specifically inhibits BTSC migration into normal brain. Immunofluorescence in situ hybridization with TMS-treated GBM cells displays both telomeric and non-telomeric DNA damage in BTSC but not in non-stem tumor cells. cDNA microarray analysis identifies a proto-oncogene, c-Myb, as a target of TMS in BTSC, and the pharmacodynamic analysis with TMS-treated tumor-bearing mouse brains demonstrates reduction of c-Myb expression in tumors. An elevated c-Myb expression is found in surgical specimens of GBM compared to normal brain tissues. Lastly, TMS treatment of BTSC-derived mouse intracranial tumors reduces tumor sizes in vivo without any noticeable apoptotic cells in the normal brain, and a combined treatment of TMS with radiation or temozolomide results in additive inhibitory effects on GBM sphere growth in vitro. Collectively, these data indicate a potential avenue toward BTSC-directed therapeutic strategy using TMS via telomeric DNA damage and inhibition of c-Myb, which may offer a novel therapeutic approach for GBM.",Excluded
2073,"Circadian light input in plants, flies and mammals The rotation of our planet results in daily changes in light and darkness, as well as seasons with characteristic photoperiods. Adaptation to these daily and seasonal changes in light properties (and associated changes in the environment) is important to the sustained survival of higher life forms on our planet. Many organisms use their intrinsic circadian oscillator or clock to orchestrate daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology to adapt to diurnal changes. Some higher organisms use the same oscillator to monitor day length in selecting the appropriate season for reproductive behaviour. Organisms have developed irradiance measurement mechanisms to ignore photic noise (lightning, moonlight), and use the light of dusk and dawn for circadian photoentrainment. They have also devised multiple photoreceptors and signalling cascades to buffer against changes in the spectral composition of natural light. The interaction of the clock with ambient light is, therefore, quite intricate. [References: 31]",Excluded
1566,"Incidental retinal phototoxicity associated with ingestion of photosensitizing drugs BACKGROUND: to report on the possible correlation between incident retinal phototoxicity and the use of photosensitizing drugs.METHODS: four patients were examined because of scotomas and visual loss after an incidental exposure to a strong light source. One patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash; one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens implantation. The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.RESULTS: on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure. Despite the visual recovery, non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected eyes.CONCLUSION: phototoxicity following incidental light exposure may occur in patients taking drugs of photosensitizing potential. Therefore, the thorough history of systemic drug ingestion should be obtained if patients have exposure to strong light sources.",Excluded

This dose is known to produce myelopathy in all animals within 6 months of irradiation. After irradiation, the animals were subdivided into three groups, and at 90 days after irradiation, neural stem cells or saline (for controls) were injected into the spinal cord, intramedullary, at two sites positioned 6 mm apart on either side of the center of the irradiated length of spinal cord.

3381,"Tractography to visualise the relationship of the optic radiation to epileptogenic lesions prior to neurosurgery Background A third of patients with epilepsy are refractory to medical treatment and may be amenable to surgery. A major concern is to avoid causing new deficits. As conventional MR imaging does not delineate the optic radiation, the risk to vision from surgery cannot be predicted, nor can surgery be tailored to minimise the risk. Methods Conventional structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired in 13 patients with medically refractory epilepsy due a lesion near the optic radiation and undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. The optic radiation was delineated and visualised in relation to the lesions on anatomical images and in 3D reconstructions. Pre- and post-operative visual fields were acquired by Goldmann perimetry. Results The relationship between the epileptogenic lesion and the optic radiation was demonstrated in each patient provididing helpful additional information in deciding whether to proceed with surgery, and in planning the surgical procedure and approach. Prseoperative and postoperative imaging findings correlated with the visual field data. Conclusion The optic radiation shows significant anatomical variability, but can be reliably delineated by tractography. As surgical disruption of the optic radiation has serious consequences for the patient, DTI tractography proves a useful technique in this population.

Though the tDCS electrode montage often follows basic rules of thumb (increased/decreased excitability ""under"" the anode/cathode electrode), computational forward models of brain current flow provide more accurate insight into detailed current flow patterns and, in some cases, can even challenge simplified electrode-placement assumptions. With the increased recognized value of computational forward models in informing tDCS montage design and interpretation of results, there have been recent advances in modeling tools and a greater proliferation of publications. In addition, the importance of customizing tDCS for potentially vulnerable populations (eg, skull defects, brain damage/stroke, and extremes of age) can be considered.

Dose prescription was set to 16 x 3.63 Gy (total dose 58.08 Gy). The clinical target volume was the entire vocal cord. Setup verification was done by means of an online correction protocol using cone beam computed tomography. Data for voice quality assessment were collected prospectively at baseline, end of treatment, and 4, 6, and 12 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment using VHI questionnaires.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 7-50 months), the 2-year local control and overall survival rates were 100% and 90% because no single local recurrence was reported and 3 patients died because of comorbidity. All patients have completed the intended treatment schedule; no treatment interruptions and no grade 3 acute toxicity were reported. Grade 2 acute dermatitis or dysphagia was reported in only 5 patients (17%). No serious late toxicity was reported; only 1 patient developed temporary grade 2 laryngeal edema, and responded to a short-course of corticosteroid. The VHI improved significantly, from 33.5 at baseline to 9.5 and 10 at 6 weeks and 18 months, respectively (P<.001).

1977,"Cerenkov luminescence imaging with PET probes for brain function analysis Objectives Optical imaging has advantages in its easy-to-use feature. However, brain imaging is not easy in optical molecular imaging, since the molecular sizes of fluorescent probes are usually too large to penetrate the bloodbrain- barrier. On the other hands, PET imaging is superior in quantitative analysis, and many brain imaging probes are available. Cerenkov radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as a positron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of CLI for the analysis of brain functions using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG, [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Methods For [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG imaging, the mice were separated into two groups. For one group, the hair of the mice were shaved (w/o hair), and for other group, the skull was additionally removed (w/o hair & skull). [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (3 MBq, iv) was injected to each group of the mice, and PET imaging was performed from 30 to 60 min after the injection. Then, Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) was done for 10 min from just after the PET imaging. After in vivo CLI, the brain was removed and ex vivo CLI was performed. Then, the radioactivity of the brain was measured by a gamma-counter. Various fasting times were set for each mouse in order to produce various blood sugar levels. For [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride imaging, the mice (w/o hair) were injected with 7.4 MBq of the tracer, and sequential 8-min CLI (followed by 2-min interval) was performed from 8-10 min after the injection. In vivo blocking study was done by treating the mice with haloperidol. Also, the images were obtained by [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Results In [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG studies, there was a good relationship between the radioactivity and CLI signal in removed brains (r=0.93). The good correlation was observed in w/o hair & skull group (r=0.92). The correlation was weaker in w/o hair group (r=0.74), but it thought to be acceptable for the analysis in mice. The striatum was successfully visualized by [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT. Luminescence in the striatum was decreased by haloperidol treatment. Since the brain uptake of [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT was higher than [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride, [<sup>11</sup>C]beta-CFT produced more clearer images in CLI.

At our centre, the number of treatments is based on the absorbed dose (AD) to the kidneys. For logistical reasons, estimation of absorbed doses should be performed with as few measurements as possible. The aim of the present work was to study how well kidney AD and effective half-life (t<inf>eff</inf>) estimations using methods with one or two measurement points agree with the method we use today that is based on three imaging points. Material(s) and Method(s): 777 patients (333 female and 444 male) with neuroendocrine tumors with high somatostatin receptor expression were included. SPECT/CT over the abdomen were acquired at 24, 96 and 168 h after start of infusion of<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. AD and teff were calculated using single exponential fits to data from 3 measurements (24-96-168) or two measurements (24- 96 and 24-168). In addition, absorbed doses were calculated using a single measurement, assuming t<inf>eff</inf>50 h (96/50h). Bias of AD and teff values relative to those based on the three-point measurement were calculated. To test statistical significance a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test with a P-value of 0.05 for significance was used. Median, Min and Max of the deviations were also calculated. Result(s): Bias versus AD(24-96- 168) was -3%(-20-72) (Median (Min-Max)) for AD(24-96), 3%(-22- 30) for AD(24-168) and -7%(-51-27) for AD(96/50h). The bias for teff in the AD calculations versus AD(24-96-168) was -9% (-53- 63) for AD(24-96) and 0% (-9-4) for AD(24-168). In all tests there was a small but significant difference for the whole group. In about 15% of the patients the bias in t<inf>eff</inf>was more than 20% when ignoring the 168-h scan. In about 5-10% of the patients AD differed more than 20% for all methods that excluded the 168-h measurement. Using a fixed limit of the absorbed dose to the kidneys, this would mean that these patients would be given either too many or too few treatments. Conclusion(s): Although absorbed dose calculations based on only one or two measurement points may serve as a good approximation for the majority of patients, it leads to substantial errors affecting the number of given treatments in about 10% of patients. Since this is a radiation treatment a high precision for all patients is warranted, and three measurements, or at least inclusion of a late 168-h measurement, are recommended.",Excluded

The disease burden in the early treatment cohort was stable over 27 weeks in 5/9 mice and progressive in 4/9 mice. These mice were sacrificed due to brain metastases. Median survival of the late treatment cohort was superior to controls (13 vs. 7 weeks; p<0.0001) but inferior to that in the early treatment cohort (13 vs. 27 weeks; p<0.001). Late cohort mice succumbed to extensive liver involvement.

2637,"Empirical vs risk-based approach to intracavernosal injection therapy: A prospective study Objectives: Intracavernosal injection (ICI) therapy is widely used for ED. Employing it in practice is largely empirical and has not been validated with evidence-based approaches. This study compares two strategies for ICI to determine whether a risk-based approach is more efficacious, increases satisfaction and/or results in fewer treatment complications. Method(s): After obtaining IRB approval, a prospective database of patients enrolled in the ICI program at the Johns Hopkins Hospital from May 2012-present was amassed. Demographic information, treatment outcomes and subjective patient evaluations of sexual function (IIEF, QEQ, SQoL and EDITS questionnaires) were obtained at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Two approaches were compared. Group 1 consisted of empiric ICI treatment. Patients were treated with Prostaglandin E1 10 mcg, irrespective of ED etiology or severity, and only if poor response noted at test injection, then initiated on bimix or trimix. Group 2 was a risk-based approach, where using an algorithm that factored in: organic vs. neurogenic ED, number of ED risk factors, prostatectomy, nerve-sparing status, time from surgery and radiation status, patients were treated with either bimix, low- or high-dose trimix. Dose titration was permitted in both groups. Statistical analysis was carried out using t-test and chi-squared analysis. Result(s): 175 patients were enrolled (57 in Group 1, 118 in Group 2) with 3 and 6 month f/u at 57% and 35% respectively, and similar between groups. Baseline patient characteristics and sexual function questionnaire responses were similar between groups 1 and 2, (mean age 61.9 vs. 61.3 p = 0.66, IIEF-EF 8.1 vs. 6.9 p = 0.28, and SQoL 37.7 vs. 39.2 p = 0.71), though Group 1 reported higher quality erections at baseline (QEQ 14.3 vs. 7.3 p = 0.05) and had a lower proportion of post-prostatectomy patients 54.4% vs. 74.6% (p = 0.02). In both groups, quality of erections (QEQ) improved with treatment (mean 10.78 vs. 56.76, p < 0.05), SQoL improved (38.41 vs. 50.25, p < 0.05), and IIEF-EF improved (7.51 vs. 18.48, p < 0.05). However, between groups at 3 and 6 months, there were no statistically significant differences in responses for IIEF, QEQ, SQoL or EDITS, and no difference in failure or medication switch rates. There were no significant differences in complication rates, though at 3 months group 2 reported a higher incidence of priapism and pain (23% vs. 7.4% p = 0.08).

Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance allow only an approximate estimation of the GFR. The aim of this study was an accurate assessment of long -term changes in GFR using the 99mTc-DTPA clearance. Of particular interest was the impact of pre-existing risk factors. Methods : GFR of 75 patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) treated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octreotate (4 intended cycles at 3 monthly intervals and mean activity of 7.9 GBq per cycle) were retrospectively analyzed. A minimum follow-up of 12 months was required for patient inclusion. Mean followup duration was 20 months (range 12-48 months), with a median of 5 GFR measurements per patient. The change of GFR was analyzed by linear curve fit. Potential risk factors including DM, HTN, previous chemotherapy and decreased renal function at baseline were analyzed regarding impact on the renal function loss. Comparability of nephrotoxicity determined by 99mTc-DTPA clearance and serum creatinine (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0) was also investigated. Results : A reduction of >2 ml / year in GFR was observed in 31 (42%) and > 10ml/year in 16 patients (22%). The mean and median decline in GFR was 12 and 7 ml per year respectively. However, only one patient developed serious nephrotoxicity (CTCAE grade III). Eleven patients showed an increase of > 10 ml/year in GFR following PRRT. Nephrotoxicity graded according to serum creatinine (CTCAE) was not compatible with GFR in 17% of the assessments and was underestimated by serum creatinine in 12% of patients. None of the investigated risk factors contributed to a reduction in GFR. Conclusions : Severe nephrotoxicity after PRRT with <sup>177</sup>Lu-octrotate is rare (1.3 % of patients).

999,"Correction of prototypic ATM splicing mutations and aberrant ATM function with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides We used antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMOs) to redirect and restore normal splicing of three prototypic splicing mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. Two of the mutations activated cryptic 5' or 3' splice sites within exonic regions; the third mutation activated a downstream 5' splice site leading to pseudoexon inclusion of a portion of intron 28. AMOs were targeted to aberrant splice sites created by the mutations; this effectively restored normal ATM splicing at the mRNA level and led to the translation of full-length, functional ATM protein for at least 84 h in the three cell lines examined, as demonstrated by immunoblotting, ionizing irradiation-induced autophosphorylation of ATM, and transactivation of ATM substrates. Ionizing irradiation-induced cytotoxicity was markedly abrogated after AMO exposure. The ex vivo data strongly suggest that the disease-causing molecular pathogenesis of such prototypic mutations is not the amino acid change of the protein but the mutated DNA code itself, which alters splicing. Such prototypic splicing mutations may be correctable in vivo by systemic administration of AMOs and may provide an approach to customized, mutation-based treatment for ataxia-telangiectasia and other genetic disorders.",Excluded

The composition of the lesion correlated with dose: the lower-dose lesions were found histologically to contain areas of edema, demyelination, reactive gliosis, and vascular proliferation; the higher-dose lesions contained increasing amounts of hemorrhage and coagulative necrosis. The borders of the lesions were sharply demarcated from surrounding normal brain. Gadolinium-enhanced MR studies correlated well with areas of blood-brain barrier breakdown, as confirmed by areas of Evans blue staining.

1602,"Idiopathic occipital neuralgia a rare cause of debilitating headache LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Identify the presentation of occipital neuralgia LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Judicious use of diagnostic tools and treatment CASE: A 27-year-old female presented to the ER with episodes of severe intermittent headache over the past 3 weeks. Prior to her presentation at admission she reported 2 episodes of intermittent pain on the right occipital region. She promptly followed with her primary care physician who prescribed her oral steroids. The 2 weeks following the initial episodes were symptom free. On the day of admission she was watching television when she experienced a recurrence of the 10/10 right sided occipital headache with radiation over her vertex. Initial vital signs were unremarkable, however, physical exam was significant for tenderness over the right occipital region of the scalp. Labs were within normal limits. MRI did not reveal any abnormality. A consultation to neurology was obtained and the patient was started on carbamazepine, gabapentin and narcotics, which provided little relief. The patient's distribution of pain in the greater occipital area in addition to ruling out secondary causes of headache made ON the likely diagnosis. Pain management was consulted and greater occipital nerve block was performed which provided complete resolution of her symptoms. She was discharged home with carbamazepine the following morning and continued to be symptom free at follow up. DISCUSSION: Occipital neuralgia is usually defined as paroxysmal stabbing pain in the greater or lesser occipital nerve distribution. Although there is no published data to suggest the incidence of occipital neuralgia (ON), it is generally considered a very rare cause of headache. ON is a rare cause of headache that has no published data on incidence. Since this is a rare disorder there is limited evidence in the literature to support the full understanding of its physiology and treatment. Currently, the diagnosis ismade by history, characteristics described in the International Headache Society, exclusion of referred pain by CT/MRI and anesthetic block of the occipital nerve. Patients with severe symptoms can continue to have a debilitating headache despite conservative management. The best treatment in the acute setting is the same intervention for diagnosis, which is an occipital nerve block. Patients with recurrent ON symptoms despite steroid injections benefit from botulinium injections and pulsed radiofrequency. This case illustrates the detailed diagnostic evaluation and the need for high suspicion by the primary physicians to consider ON. It is often challenging to diagnose, yet it is critical to do so as early diagnosis and treatment can maximize recovery.",Excluded
492,"Criteria for assessing the efficacy of brachytherapy of uveal melanomas, complications of therapy and there prevention. [Russian] The authors assess the efficacy of brachytherapy of uveal melanomas in 954 patients. Strontium ophthalmoapplicators were used in 652, rutenium ones in 302 patients. As a rule, Sr applicators were sutured in patients with tumors up to 3.5 mm thick and Ru ones in cases with tumors thicker than 3.5 mm. A special program was used for individual approach and improving the accuracy of planning. A total of 74.5% of patients have been followed up for at least 3 years, with check-ups every 3-6 months. The effect of brachytherapy was considered positive in cases with complete resorption or at least 50% decrease of the tumor and a stable clinical picture for 9-12 months. In 60% of patients the tumor regressed completely, in 16% partially, and in 24% there were signs of activation of melanoma growth one year after treatment. The frequency of radiation complications was as follows: retinopaty, 3.15%; neuroretinopathy, 1.1%; hemophthalmia, 0.9%; neovascular glaucoma, 1.1%; cataract, 0.63%. The incidence of radiation complications increases with increase of the applicator power and rigidity of exposure.

576,"Coordinated action of the Fanconi anemia and ataxia telangiectasia pathways in response to oxidative damage Fanconi anemia (FA) and ataxia telangiectasia (AT) share common traits such chromosomal instability and proneness to hematological cancers. Both AT and FA cell lines, and patients, are characterized by abnormally high levels of oxidative stress markers. The key FA protein FANCD2 is phosphorylated on Ser 222 by ATM after ionizing radiation (IR), thus allowing normal activation of the S-phase checkpoint, and ATM cells are known to be hypersensitive to oxidative damage. In this work we show that FANCD2 deficient cells have a defective S-phase checkpoint after Hydrogen Peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induced oxidative damage. ATM dependent phosphorylation of FANCD2 at the S222 residue is necessary for normal S-phase checkpoint activation after oxidative stress, while FANCD2 monoubiquitination at K561 is dispensable. We also show that FANCD2 is not required for base excision repair of 8-oxoG and other DNA lesions (abasic sites, uracils), while treatments that exclusively induce 8-oxoG, but not DNA double strand breaks, fail to activate FANCD2 monoubiquitination, thus indicating that the known accumulation of 8-oxoG in FA cells reflects an overproduction of ROS rather than defective processing of oxidized bases. We conclude that the handling of DNA damage after H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress requires the coordinated action of FANCD2 and ATM.",Excluded
3252,"An assessment of methods for monitoring entrance surface dose in fluoroscopically guided interventional proceduces In the light of a growing awareness of the risks of inducing skin injuries as a consequence of fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures (FGIPs), this paper reports measurements of ESDs made during the period August 1998 to June 1999 on 137 patients undergoing cardiac, neurological and general FGIPs in the South London area. In addition, different methods suitable for use in a routine monitoring programme of ESD are discussed. Although the need for additional data is acknowledged, the results reported reinforce the need for routine assessments to be made of ESDs in FGIPs. At present, the most reliable and accurate form of ESD measurement would seem to be arrays of TLDs. However, transducer based methods although likely to be less accurate, have considerable advantages in relation to a continuous monitoring programme. It is also suggested that there may be the potential locally for threshold dose area product (DAP) values to be set for specific procedures. These could be used to provide early warning of the potential for skin injuries.",Excluded

In addition, the probable effects of radiotherapy on the activities of antioxidant enzymes and levels of nitric oxide (NO) in the plasma were investigated as well. The effects of melatonin treatment on radiotherapy-based central nervous system (CNS) damage were also studied. For this purpose, the rats were randomized into four groups. The first group was the control group (sham-exposed group), the second group received only melatonin, the third group was irradiated and the fourth group received both melatonin and irradiation. Plasma samples of rats were collected for measuring the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and the levels of NO. 24 h after the interventions, tissue samples were obtained from the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex for the light microscopic investigations. These tissues were mostly affected by radiation. The results indicated that the application of radiation significantly enhanced the levels of plasma SOD and NO. On the other hand, melatonin pretreatment prevented the decrease in plasma CAT activity induced by irradiation. It was found that the application of melatonin could significantly prevent the irradiation-induced damages. Light microscopic results revealed that the damage of the CNS by radiation was prevented by the application of melatonin.",Included

The reversal potential (Erev) of the light induced current (IL) and its changes due to altered extracellular concentration of potassium support the assumption that (IL) is due to suppression of K+ conductance. Elevation of intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP by adding 8-bromo-cGMP into the bathing solution or by injecting the nucleotide into the cell mimics, in all cases, the effect of light: it produces an inward current accompanied by decrement of slope conductance. The effect of elevation of cAMP was inconsistent. The I-V relations of IL and IcGMP follow a similar course and have a common Erev. The assumption that 3',5'-cyclic GMP is increased by light is also supported by comparing the effect of light and the cyclic nucleotide on the action potential.

2295,"Effects of Proton and Combined Proton and (56)Fe Radiation on the Hippocampus The space radiation environment contains protons and (56)Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to space flight crews during and after missions. The space environment involves complex radiation exposures, thus, the effects of a dose of protons might be modulated by a dose of heavy-ion radiation. The brain, and particularly the hippocampus, may be susceptible to space radiation-induced changes. In this study, we first determined the dose-response effect of proton radiation (150 MeV) on hippocampus-dependent cognition 1 and 3 months after exposure. Based on those results, we subsequently exposed mice to protons alone (150 MeV, 0.1 Gy), (56)Fe alone (600 MeV/n, 0.5 Gy) or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations (protons first) with the two exposures separated by 24 h. At one month postirradiation, all animal groups showed novel object recognition. However, at three months postirradiation, mice exposed to either protons or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations showed impaired novel object recognition, which was not observed in mice irradiated with (56)Fe alone. The mechanisms in these impairments might involve inflammation. In mice irradiated with protons alone or (56)Fe alone three months earlier, there was a negative correlation between a measure of novel object recognition and the number of newly born activated microglia in the dentate gyrus. Next, cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed in the hippocampus. At one month after exposure the levels of IL-12 were higher in mice exposed to combined radiations compared with sham-irradiated mice, while the levels of IFN-gamma were lower in mice exposed to (56)Fe radiation alone or combined radiations. In addition, IL-4 levels were lower in (56)Fe-irradiated mice compared with proton-irradiated mice and TNF-alpha levels were lower in proton-irradiated mice than in mice receiving combined radiations. At three months after exposure, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and eotaxin levels were lower in mice receiving combined radiations. The levels of MDC and eotaxin correlated and the levels of MDC, but not eotaxin, correlated with the percentage of newly born activated microglia in the blades of the dentate gyrus. Finally, hippocampal IL-6 levels were higher in mice receiving combined radiations compared with mice receiving (56)Fe radiation alone. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of novel object recognition for detecting cognitive injury three months after exposure to proton radiation alone, and combined exposure to proton and (56)Fe radiations, and that newly-born activated microglia and inflammation might be involved in this injury.",Included

2963,"Collateral damage of radiation to normal tissues: What can the retina tell us? Purpose : Damage to normal tissue in an irradiated field (normal tissue injury, NTI) is a complication of radiation therapy believed to be caused by microvessel pathology. In the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS), vascular pathology was described in uveal melanoma (UM) patients 2 years post-radiation therapy. However, the COMS and other studies used subjective scoring systems, lacked a control group, did not assess neuronal function in detail, and used dosimetry methods simplified for clinical application. Methods : Optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) was used to characterize vascular pathology by vessel density, fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) size, parafoveal density (PVD), and by machine learning-derived density maps. OCT-derived retinal layer thickness and 10-2 visual field testing (VF) were used to quantify corresponding neuronal loss and dysfunction. Patient-specific 3D dosimetry models were constructed to spatially correlate dose to each outcome measure. Measurements were taken in both eyes of 31 UM patients at 0.5-150 mo post-<sup>125</sup>I plaque brachytherapy, and 16 age-matched controls. Data were normalized to the contralateral eye to account for subject variation due to age or systemic disease. Results : Abnormal vessel density, FD, lacunarity, FAZ size, and PVD were observed after 24 mo in 25 out of 31 subjects, whereas only 6 subjects showed any vascular pathology before 24 mo. Visual acuity was the least sensitive indicator of adverse outcome, with only 16% of the entire population showing a visual decline of two or more Snellen lines since diagnosis. Neuronal dysfunction by VF correlated strongly with most measures, especially vessel density, thinning of the superficial retina, and radiation dose (p<0.001). Abnormalities were observed only at doses above 20 Gy. Conclusions : Using a series of quantitative approaches, radiation microvasculopathy was detected starting at 24 mo post-exposure in most patients. Strong correlations between loss of neuronal function, vascular pathology, and dose were observed. Prospective studies will help determine whether vascular pathology precedes neuronal loss.",Included
1965,"Iodinated contrast agent time course in human brain metastasis: A study for synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy clinical trials Purpose/Objective(s): Synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy (SSRT) is an innovative treatment combining the selective accumulation of heavy elements in tumors with stereotactic irradiations using monochromatic medium energy x-rays from a synchrotron source. Phase I/II clinical trials on brain metastasis are underway using venous infusion of iodinated contrast agents. The radiation dose enhancement depends on the amount of iodine in the tumor and its time course. Quantitative, post-infusion iodine bio-distribution and associated brain perfusion parameters were studied in human brain metastasis as key parameters for treatment feasibility and quality. The reproducibility of iodine concentrations between the recruitment day and the treatment day was assessed in order to predict dose errors. Materials/Methods: Twelve patients received an intravenous bolus of iodinated contrast agent (40 mL, 4 mL/s), followed by a steady-state infusion (160 mL, 0.5 mL/s) in order to ensure stable intratumoral amounts of iodine during the treatment. Absolute iodine concentrations and quantitative perfusion maps were derived from 40 multi-slice dynamic conventional CT images of the brain (recruitment day) or from quantitative synchrotron radiation CT (treatment day). For three of these patients, iodine concentrations reached in the tumor were compared between the recruitment day and the treatment day (~ 10 days interval). Result(s): The post-infusion mean intratumoral iodine concentration (over thirty minutes) reached 1.94 +/- 0.12 mg/mL. Reasonable correlations were obtained between these concentrations and the permeability surface area product and the cerebral blood volume. Iodine concentrations were reproducible leading to dose errors in the radiotherapy standards. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study of contrast agent biodistribution versus time in brain metastasis. The study demonstrates that suitable and stable amounts of iodine can be reached in brain metastasis for SSRT treatment. Moreover, the associated perfusion measurements provide useful information for the patient recruitment and management processes.",Excluded

ATM-deficient and p53-deficient fibroblasts also exhibited abnormally increased levels of phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX) at later intervals after irradiation. In the clonogenic assay, ATM-deficient cells exhibited marked radiosensitivity and p53-deficient cells had varying degrees of radioresistance compared with normal fibroblasts.CONCLUSION: Regardless of whether ataxia telangiectasia and Li-Fraumeni syndrome fibroblasts are DSB-repair deficient per se, it is apparent that p53 and ATM defects greatly influence the cellular phenotype as evidenced by the neutral comet and gamma-H2AX assays. Our data suggest that the gamma-H2AX levels observed at later intervals after irradiation may represent a reliable measure of the overall DSB rejoining capabilities of human fibroblasts. However, it appears that using this parameter as a predictor of radiosensitivity without knowledge of the cells' p53 status could lead to incorrect conclusions.",Excluded

Our goal was to study the pattern of mortality among Greek commercial airline cockpit and cabin crew. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study including 843 Olympic Airways cockpit crew and 1835 cabin attendants. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated based on death rates of the Greek population. Duration of employment as a proxy for occupational exposure was used to stratify the cohort. Results. For cockpit crew, the overall SMR was 0.7 (n = 65, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9). The SMR for all cancers was also significantly decreased (n = 17; SMR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Most of this reduction was due to a large deficit in lung cancer deaths (SMR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0-0.5). Slight but non-significant increases were noted for brain and liver cancer. The SMR for cardiovascular death was close to unity. Among female cabin attendants the SMR for all causes was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.4-1.3). The SMR for all cancers was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3-1.7). Mortality from breast cancer was not increased. Among male cabin crew, SMR for all causes was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Analyses according to duration of employment showed no pattern. Conclusions. In this first-ever occupational cohort study in Greece, Greek aircrew had a low overall and cancer mortality. Due to the small number of events, the strength of our study is limited. The Greek data will be included in a pooled analysis of European studies.",Included

A thymoma was diagnosed following ultrasound and biopsy of the mass. Treatment was initiated with coarse-fraction radiation therapy using external-beam therapy (four fractions of 5 Gy). The mass responded, but granulocytopenia developed. Bone marrow examination showed a myeloid to erythroid ratio of approximately 1:1, with a left shift within the myeloid line. These findings, as well as the lack of toxic changes within the peripheral blood neutrophils, suggested immune-mediated destruction of peripheral granulocytes. Immune suppression with prednisone and cyclosporine was instituted. After 7 weeks, the neutrophil count returned to normal. The tumor was removed, and cyclosporine was reduced and eventually discontinued 3 weeks postsurgery.",Excluded

1353,"Asynchronous inputs and NMDA conductances predict excitatory responses in the cortical-cA1 pathway of the hippocampus In the hippocampus, CA1 place cells are driven by a substantial input from CA3. There is a second pathway to CA1 from the entorhinal cortex. The mode of action of cortex on CA1 through this pathway is not known. The pathway supports CA1 place field activity after CA3 has been lesioned, yet stimulation of the pathway in rat slices results in strong feedforward inhibition that prevents pyramidal cell action potentials. We use a detailed conductance-based model of this pathway to simulate the response to cortical stimulation in slice experiments and in vivo spatial exploration. We find that the presence of NMDA conductances enable CA1 pyramidal cells to integrate cortical inputs over a time scale longer than that which is effective in recruiting the inhibitory response that can suppress action potentials. We then show that this asynchronous response mode supports place field formation in response to experimentally constrained spatially modulated cortical activity. Within this model, the inclusion of GABAB conductances and the hyperpolarisation activated current I(h) reduces the strength of the GABAA inputs required to balance the excitatory inputs, and this facilitates place field formation by reducing variability in the inhibitory inputs.",Excluded

This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of intracoronary radiation therapy (ICRT) after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for preventing restenosis in human coronary arteries.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22 arteries) with unstable angina underwent standard balloon angioplasty. ICRT was performed with the use of an 192Ir source wire that was hand delivered to the angioplasty site. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 24 hours, between 30 and 60 days, and at 6 months. Angioplasty was successful in 19 of 22 lesions, and insertion of the radioactive source wire was successful at all treated sites. Angiographic study at 24 hours demonstrated early late loss of the luminal diameter from 1.92+/-0.55 to 1.40+/-0.27 mm. Between 30 and 60 days, repeat angiography demonstrated total occlusion in 2 arteries, a new pseudoaneurysm in 1 artery, and significant dilatation at the treatment site in 2 additional vessels. At > or = 6 months' follow-up, all remaining arteries (n=20) maintained patent, with a mean lumen diameter of 1.65+/-0.8 mm. The calculated late lumen loss was 0.27+/-0.56 mm, and the late loss index was 0.19. Clinical events at 1 year included myocardial infarction in 1 patient, repeat angioplasty to the treated site in 3 patients, and persistent angina in 7 patients.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate that ICRT after coronary intervention is feasible and is associated with an acceptable degree of complications and lower rates of angiographic restenosis indexes.",Excluded
1398,"Preservation of cognitive function following whole brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases: Complications, treatments, and the emerging role of memantine Whole brain radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients suffering from stage IV malignancies that have metastasized to the brain. Although this therapy is often effective at reducing tumor size and burden, it is associated with a spectrum of toxicities that often result in irreversible cognitive decline. Various drug and non-drug therapies have been evaluated to treat this neurotoxicity after whole brain radiotherapy is administered; however, currently available options have shown little benefit or come with side effects themselves that may outweigh the benefits of their use. For this reason, current investigations are focusing on preventing cognitive decline, rather than attempting to attenuate symptoms after they occur. Memantine has consistently shown promise in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies as a neuroprotective agent that may improve cognitive outcomes in patients undergoing whole brain radiotherapy. Memantine use prior to and during whole brain radiotherapy has been shown to significantly delay time to cognitive failure and reduce the rate of decline in memory, cognitive function, and processing speed. Its use has also been linked to significant decreases in brain edema, brain infarct size, and brain vasculature changes following whole brain radiotherapy. Memantine offers a promising safety profile with high tolerability and limited side effects. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the target patient population, the neurotoxic effects of WBRT, current treatment options, and a summary of the available literature surrounding the use of memantine in this setting.",Excluded

Method(s): During March 2009 and December 2010, 11 locally advanced (stage IIIB) lung squamous cell carcinoma patients were included in this prospective Phase II trial, included 9 male patients and 2 female patients, the median age was 54 (range 41-64). All patients received thoracic radiotherapy (6MV X-ray, IMRT) to involved-field with the median dose of 60Gy/30f (range 50Gy/25f-66Gy/33f), and concurrent with nimotuzumab (200mg, weekly) for the median of 6 weeks (range 6-8 weeks) plus docetaxel (60mg/m<sup>2</sup>)/carboplatin (AUC=5) on day 1 administered intravenously every 21 days for 2 cycles, patients with stable disease or better after concurrent chemoradiotherapy received consolidation chemotherapy of docetaxel (75mg/ m<sup>2</sup>)/carboplatin (AUC=5) on day 1 administered intravenously every 21 days for 2 cycles. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 11 months (range 2.5-23 months), confirmed responses included 2 CR, 6 PR, 1 SD and 2 PD, the best objective response rate (CR plus PR rate) was 72.7% (8/11). Median progression-free survival was 12 months (95%CI: 0.85-23.15 months), median survival was not reached (overall survival range 2.5-23 months), and six-month survival was 81.8%. At the end of follow-up, there were 6 patients had disease progression, included 3 patients of locoregional failure and 3 patients of distant metastases (1 with brain metastases, 1 with retroperitoneal lymph nodes metastases, 1 with brain and bone metastases), 2 disease progressions occurred during concurrent chemoradiation (both with distant metastases and died sooner after) and other 4 disease progressions occurred after consolidation chemotherapy. Grade 1 to 3 radiation pneumonitis were observed in 7 (63.6%); 2 (18.2%), 2 (18.2%) patients; grade 1 to 3 radiation esophagitis were observed in 2 (18.2%) , 7 (63.6%) and 2 (18.2%) patients; grade 1 to 2 radiation dermatitis were observed in 9 (81.8%) and 2 (18.2%) patients; grade 2 to 4 neutropenia were observed in 3 (27.2%), 4 (36.4%) and 4 (36.4%) patients; grade 1 to 3 thrombocytopenia were observed in 3 (27.2%), 1 (9.1%) and 2 (18.2%) patients, no skin rash or allergic toxicities appeared.

21,"Clinical outcome after fractionated radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma Purpose/Objective(s): Pituitary tumors are relatively uncommon. Primary goals of treatment include normalization of hormonal level and improving visual or neurological symptoms. Surgery, medical treatment, irradiation, or combination of these modalities is used to achieve these goals. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the clinical outcome of pituitary adenoma treated with fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of pituitary adenoma treated at our center between 2006 and 2014. A total of 88 patients with biopsy-proven adenomas were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 38 years (18-79 years) and 49 patients (56%) were males. Majority of tumors were marcoadenoma (87%). Presenting symptoms were mainly hormonal disturbance in 43 patients (49%), visual defects in 29 patients (33%) and headache in 21 patients (23%). Prolactinomas were the most common secretory adenoma in 22 patients (51%), followed by growth hormone secreting adenomas in 15 patients (35%) and ACTH-secreting tumors in 5 patients (12%), while one patient had TSH-secreting adenoma. The cohort follow up time reached 87 months (mean; 32 months). The primary endpoints are clinical and biochemical control. Result(s): Thirteen patients lost to follow up, therefore 75 patients were included in the final analysis. Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 70 patients (93%).While medical treatment was used for inoperable or hormonal secreting adenoma in 30 patients (40%). Fractionated radiation therapy was delivered to 28 patients (37%), indications for radiation were symptomatic, incompletely resected tumors (16 patients) or persistent hypersecretion (12 patients). For secretory tumors the median radiation dose was 52Gy (50-54Gy), and lower dose was delivered for non-secretory adenoma; mean 50Gy (45-52Gy). For patients received radiation therapy, the tumor control rate is 75% for non-functioning adenomas, and 69% for functioning adenomas. Conclusion(s): Pituitary adenoma is a slow growing benign tumor; however devastating effect can result from neurological deficits or hormonal imbalance. Our results reveal that functioning adenomas carry worse prognosis. Fractionated radiation therapy, as an adjunct to surgery and medical treatment, offers good clinical and biochemical control for pituitary adenoma.

1912,"S-Nitrosylation in Organs of Mice Exposed to Low or High Doses of gamma-Rays: The Modulating Effect of Iodine Contrast Agent at a Low Radiation Dose The covalent addition of nitric oxide (NO<sup>*</sup>) onto cysteine thiols, or S-nitrosylation, modulates the activity of key signaling proteins. The dysregulation of normal S-nitrosylation contributes to degenerative conditions and to cancer. To gain insight into the biochemical changes induced by low-dose ionizing radiation, we determined global S-nitrosylation by the ""biotin switch"" assay coupled with mass spectrometry analyses in organs of C57BL/6J mice exposed to acute 0.1 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma-rays. The dose of radiation was delivered to the whole body in the presence or absence of iopamidol, an iodinated contrast agent used during radiological examinations. To investigate whether similar or distinct nitrosylation patterns are induced following high-dose irradiation, mice were exposed in parallel to acute 4 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma rays. Analysis of modulated S-nitrosothiols (SNO-proteins) in freshly-harvested organs of animals sacrificed 13 days after irradiation revealed radiation dose- and contrast agent-dependent changes. The major results were as follows: (i) iopamidol alone had significant effects on S-nitrosylation in brain, lung and liver; (ii) relative to the control, exposure to 0.1 Gy without iopamidol resulted in statistically-significant SNO changes in proteins that differ in molecular weight in liver, lung, brain and blood plasma; (iii) iopamidol enhanced the decrease in S-nitrosylation induced by 0.1 Gy in brain; (iv) whereas a decrease in S-nitrosylation occurred at 0.1 Gy for proteins of ~50 kDa in brain and for proteins of ~37 kDa in liver, an increase was detected at 4 Gy in both organs; (v) mass spectrometry analyses of nitrosylated proteins in brain revealed differential modulation of SNO proteins (e.g., sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1; beta tubulins; ADP-ribosylation factor 5) by low- and high-dose irradiation; and (vi) ingenuity pathway analysis identified major signaling networks to be modulated, in particular the neuronal nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway was differentially modulated by low- and high-dose gamma-irradiation.",Included

903,"Dose Reduction in Contrast-Enhanced Cervical MR Angiography: Field Strength Dependency of Vascular Signal Intensity, Contrast Administration, and Arteriographic Quality OBJECTIVE: Cervical contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) has proven accurate and superior to noncontrast alternatives. We proposed the systematic investigation of dose reduction in contrast-enhanced MRA, hypothesizing heightened tolerance at 3 T vs 1.5 T. Quantitative and qualitative features were compared between full-dose and 50%-reduced dose examinations at 1.5 T and 3 T.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight cervical contrast-enhanced MRA examinations were reviewed for qualitative and quantitative (signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) features across four dose-field strength combinations: 1.5 T, 0.05 mmol/kg; 3 T, 0.05 mmol/kg; 1.5 T, 0.1 mmol/kg; and 3 T, 0.1 mmol/kg. Quantitative features were evaluated among the following segments: aortic arch, common carotid arteries, common carotid bifurcations, and cervical internal carotid arteries. A qualitative visual rating scale was applied for the same segments as well as to the vertebral arteries along their proximal (V1), intraforaminal (V2), and distal extraforaminal (V3) courses. Significant between-group differences were reported at p < 0.05.RESULTS: Qualitatively good arteriography was observed in all segments for all protocols. No significant qualitative differences between protocols were noted throughout evaluation of the anterior cervical circulation. Significant qualitative differences were observed only for V2 and V3 segments at half-dose 1.5-T compared with the remaining protocols (p < 0.05). No significant quantitative differences were present between full-dose and dose-reduced 3-T MRA in any segment. At 1.5 T, significant decrement in SNR and CNR at half-dose was present only within the cervical internal carotid artery.CONCLUSION: Dose reduction in cervical contrast-enhanced MRA is feasible at 3 T without significant compromise in arteriographic quality in most segments. Particularly at 3 T, arteriography is quantitatively and qualitatively robust and may be advisable in high-risk patients.",Excluded

The number of Abeta plaques, along with expression of AD specific genes (84 genes: Mouse Alzheimer's Disease RT(2) Profiler), radiation-associated cytokines (Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine Chemokine Immunoassay) and immunohistochemistry (IL10, IL-1beta, Iba1 CD45) was assessed. Behavioral testing was performed to relate changes in Abeta burden to cognitive function using a Morris water-maze task.RESULTS: Single X-ray doses reduced the number (p=0.002) and size (p=0.01) of Abeta plaques. Low-dose fractionation produced greater 50.6% (1 Gy x 10), 72% (2 Gy x 5) and 78% (2 Gy x 10) reductions. Irradiation was associated with gene (Pkp4, 1.5-fold, p=0.004) and proteomic (MIP-2, 8-fold, p=0.0024) changes at 24-48 h. Microglia increased at 4 weeks post-irradiation (p=0.001). The reduction in Abeta burden (2 Gy x 5) was associated with cognitive improvement (p=0.012).CONCLUSION: This is the first report that a clinically relevant course of external beam irradiation (2 Gy x 5) produces a significant reduction in AD-associated amyloid-beta plaques with a subsequent improvement in cognitive function.

During the past two decades the incidence of PCNSL has increased, and as a result clinical research to determine the optimal treatment for PCNSL patients also has increased. Diagnosis is based on histopathologic findings traditionally established by biopsy only. More recent data raise controversy and challenges this biopsy-only paradigm, showing a potential advantage for surgical resection with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Using high-dose intravenous (IV) methotrexate-based chemotherapy alone or as part of a regimen can lead to disease cure. The role of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) remains controversial and more frequently is omitted to avoid potential delayed neurocognitive effects, especially in patients older than age 60 years. Newer data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) using five cycles of Rituximab, Methotrexate, Vincristine, and Procarbazine (R-MVP) followed by low-dose WBRT (2,340 cgy), and then two cycles of Ara-C had excellent disease control with low neuro-toxicity and is now the basis of an ongoing RTOG (Radiation Treatment Oncology Group) trial comparing early versus delayed WBRT. Other chemotherapeutics and novel treatments, such as autologous stem cell transplantation, are being studied for potential use in PCNSL. Unlike many other primary brain tumors seen in adults, PCNSL is potentially curable; therefore, balancing treatment decisions with long-term neurocognitive effects and toxicities is crucial.",Excluded
2031,"Measured attenuation correction methods Accurate attenuation correction is a prerequisite for the determination of exact local radioactivity concentrations in positron emission tomography. Attenuation correction factors range from 4-5 in brain studies to 50-100 in whole body measurements. This report gives an overview of the different methods of determining the attenuation correction factors by transmission measurements using an external positron emitting source. The long-lived generator nuclide 68Ge/68Ga is commonly used for this purpose. The additional patient dose from the transmission source is usually a small fraction of the dose due to the subsequent emission measurement. Ring-shaped transmission sources as well as rotating point or line sources are employed in modern positron tomographs. By masking a rotating line or point source, random and scattered events in the transmission scans can be effectively suppressed. The problems of measured attenuation correction are discussed: transmission/emission mismatch, random and scattered event contamination, counting statistics, transmission/emission scatter compensation, transmission scan after administration of activity to the patient.

1668,"Association Between Radiation Necrosis and Tumor Biology After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastasis BACKGROUND: The primary dose-limiting toxicity of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is radiation necrosis (RN), which occurs after approximately 5% to 10% of treatments. This adverse event may worsen neurologic deficits, increase the frequency and cost of imaging, and necessitate prolonged treatment with steroids or antiangiogenic agents. Previous investigations have primarily identified lesion size and dosimetric constraints as risk factors for RN in small populations. We hypothesized that disease histology, receptor status, and mutational status are associated with RN.METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients presenting with brain metastasis between 1997 and 2015 who underwent SRS and subsequent radiographic follow-up at a single tertiary-care institution were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of radiographic RN. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to identify biological risk factors for RN.RESULTS: 1939 patients (5747 lesions) were eligible for inclusion; 285 patients (15%) experienced radiographic RN after the treatment of 427 (7%) lesions. After SRS, the median time to RN was 7.6 months. After multivariate analysis, graded prognostic assessment, renal pathology, lesion diameter, and the heterogeneity index remained independently predictive of RN in the pooled cohort. In subset analyses of individual pathologies, HER2-amplified status (hazard ratio [HR] 2.05, P=.02), BRAF V600+ mutational status (HR 0.33, P=.04), lung adenocarcinoma histology (HR 1.89, P=.04), and ALK rearrangement (HR 6.36, P<.01) were also associated with RN.CONCLUSIONS: In the present investigation constituting the largest series of RN, several novel risk factors were identified, including renal histology, lung adenocarcinoma histology, HER2 amplification, and ALK/BRAF mutational status. These risk factors may be used to guide clinical trial design incorporating biological risk stratification or dose escalation. Future studies determining the optimal timing of targeted therapies are warranted to further define the risk of RN.",Excluded

2736,"Spatial learning and memory deficits induced by exposure to iron-56-particle radiation It has previously been shown that exposing rats to particles of high energy and charge (HZE) disrupts the functioning of the dopaminergic system and behaviors mediated by this system, such as motor performance and an amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion; these adverse behavioral and neuronal effects are similar to those seen in aged animals. Because cognition declines with age, spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/nucleon high-energy (56)Fe particles, to test the cognitive behavioral consequences of radiation exposure. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment compared to the control group as seen in their increased latencies to find the hidden platform, particularly on the reversal day when the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant. Also, the irradiated group used nonspatial strategies during the probe trials (swim with no platform), i.e. less time spent in the platform quadrant, fewer crossings of and less time spent in the previous platform location, and longer latencies to the previous platform location. These findings are similar to those seen in aged rats, suggesting that an increased release of reactive oxygen species may be responsible for the induction of radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits. If these decrements in behavior also occur in humans, they may impair the ability of astronauts to perform critical tasks during long-term space travel beyond the magnetosphere.",Included
2364,"Impact of cellular localization of survivin on the resistance of glioblastoma cells againstthe monoalkylating anticancer drugs Question: Despite constant progress in medical care, brain tumors WHO grade IV (Glioblastoma multiforme) remain incurable. In the last decade, survivin, an inhibitor of the apoptosis proteins (IAP) family, was shown to be a promising target, as it is selectively expressed in tumors and its expression correlates with the grade of malignancy and therapy response. Besides being an anti-apoptotic factor, survivin plays a role during chromosome segregation in mitosis. It passively penetrates into the nucleus but is actively exported out of the nucleus through its C-terminal nuclear export sequence (NES). Since nuclear accumulation of survivin was observed upon exposure to ionizing radiation, where survivin seems to support DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, the question arises whether also alkylation-induced DSBs impact survivin localization and how this affects DNA repair, cell cycle, clastogenicity and cellular survival. Method(s): DNA cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, transfection and generation of stable clones, immunofluorescence, colony-forming assays, flow cytometric cell death assays, western blot analysis, Co-IP/ interactome analysis, chromosomal aberration assays. Result(s): To answer the questions, we generated glioblastoma cell clones stably expressing either a GFP-survivin or a NES-mutated GFP-survivin fusion protein (GFPNESmut-survivin). In colony-forming assays, we observed that cell clones with strong GFP-survivin expression were mostly protected against temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line monoalkylating drug, whereas clones expressing GFP-NESmut-survivin were most sensitive. We also observed that GFP-survivin was efficiently exported out of the nucleus, whereas the mutated GFP-survivin retained in the nucleus and even accumulated during the time course of TMZ exposure. Neither of GFP-survivin variants co-localized with yH2AXfoci, but interestingly, cells expressing GFP-NESmut-survivin showed significantly more TMZ-induced yH2AX foci as compared to GFP-survivin expressing cells. This correlates with the observed overall survival after exposure to the drug. Coimmunoprecipitation in nuclear extracts of TMZ-exposed cells using survivin as bait revealed its potential specific interactors. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data show that only survivin localized in the nucleus renders glioblastoma cells hypersensitive to TMZ, which stresses nuclear survivin to be a beneficial prognostic marker and supports the use of nuclear export inhibitors as adjuvant drugs.",Excluded

This radiotracer displayed good brain penetration (3.1% of the injected dose (ID) in whole brain at 15 min post-radioligand injection). Radioligand distribution was consistent with the density of high affinity nAChRs with highest uptake observed in the nAChR-rich thalamus (14.9 %ID/g at 60 min), moderate uptake in cortex (8.5 %ID/g at 60 min), and lowest uptake in the cerebellum (2.4 %ID/g at 60 min). Pretreatment with several different nAChR agonists (A-85380, (-)-nicotine, cytisine) significantly inhibited [I-125]-5-IA binding in all brain regions studied (P < 0.01) demonstrating the high specificity of the radioligand for nAChRs. Blocking doses of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine and the non-competitive nAChR channel blocker mecamylamine had no significant effect on radioactive uptake supporting the in vitro selectivity of [I-125]-5-IA for the nAChR component of the cholinergic system. [I-125]-5-IA binding sites were shown to be saturable with unlabeled 5-IA. With a relatively low acute toxicity (LD50 > 3 mg/kg via intravenous injection in mice) and high in vivo specificity and selectivity, 5-IA labeled with the imaging radionuclide I-123 may Drove useful for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies of nAChRs in human subjects.",Excluded

69,"Electroretinographic Assessment of Inner Retinal Signaling in the Isolated and Superfused Murine Retina PURPOSE: Longer-lasting electroretinographic recordings of the isolated murine retina were initially achieved by modification of a phosphate-buffered nutrient solution originally developed for the bovine retina. During experiments with a more sensitive mouse retina, apparent model-specific limitations were addressed and improvements were analyzed for their contribution to an optimized full electroretinogram (ERG).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retinas were isolated from dark-adapted mice, transferred to a recording chamber and superfused with different solutions. Scotopic and photopic ERGs were recorded with white flashes every 3 minutes. The phosphate buffer (Sickel-medium) originally used was replaced by a carbonate-based system (Ames-medium), the pH of which was adjusted to 7.7-7.8. Moreover, addition of 0.1 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub> was investigated to reduce b-wave contamination by the slow PIII component typically present in the murine ERG.RESULTS: B-wave amplitudes were increased by the pH-shift (pH 7.4 to pH 7.7) from 22.9 +/- 1.9 microV to 37.5 +/- 2.5 microV. Improved b-wave responses were also achieved by adding small amounts of Ba<sup>2+</sup> (100 microM), which selectively suppressed slow PIII components, thereby unmasking more of the true b-wave amplitude (100.0% with vs. 22.2 +/- 10.7% without Ba<sup>2+</sup>). Ames medium lacking amino acids and vitamins was unable to maintain retinal signaling, as evident in a reversible decrease of the b-wave to 31.8 +/- 3.9% of its amplitude in complete Ames medium.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide optimized conditions for ex vivo ERGs from the murine retina and suggest that careful application of Ba<sup>2+</sup> supports reliable isolation of b-wave responses in mice. Under our recording conditions, murine retinas show reproducible ERGs for up to six hours.",Excluded

Methods We designed a 6-month pilot Rapid Access Palliative Radiotherapy Program (RAPRP) brain metastases clinic. The main goals of the clinic were: (1) to provide timely consultation and treatment, (2) to provide multidisciplinary assessment and care, (3) to facilitate accrual of patients to research studies, and (4) to be a positive experience for patients. Team members included a radiation oncologist, radiation therapist, nurse practitioner, social worker (SW), occupational therapist (OT), and registered dietitian (RD). Patients underwent multidimensional assessment with patient-reported questionnaires and completed a patient satisfaction survey. Data were collected in a prospective database and collated in a standardized fashion with descriptive statistics recorded as percentages, medians, and ranges. Results The pilot brain metastases clinic ran weekly from August 5, 2009 to January 27, 2010. In total, 33 patients were seen. The median time from referral date to clinic date was 6 days, with 76% of patients seen within 1 week. Most patients (94%) started their radiotherapy on clinic day. Fifteen patients (45%) required assessment by a SW, 36% by an OT, and 33% by a RD. Ninety-one percent of patients participated in a research study. Eighty-six percent of patients reported being very satisfied with the clinic experience, and 97% would recommend the clinic to a patient in a similar situation.

2175,"Capillary optics for neutron capture therapy The development of capillary neutron optics permits a new technology for neutron capture therapy involving the application of a focused thermal neutron beam at the medically optimal location within the patient. A subthermal neutron beam begins to converge as it travels through a neutron 'lens,' reaching a narrow focus within a tube that allows it to pass directly to the treatment region. This technique results in a substantially lower dose to untreated parts of the patient and a substantially weaker radiation field in the treatment room generally. Additional advantages include the relative ease of thermal neutron generation and the ability to shield the patient completely and effectively from fast neutrons or gamma rays originating at the neutron source. This work describes the application of capillary optics to neutron capture therapy, along with Monte Carlo calculations of the neutron flux profiles within a patient for an optimized system design. Specific dose profiles for the case of boron neutron capture therapy within the brain are also provided.",Excluded

While exploring the role of calmodulin in this cascade, we found that intracellular injection of Ca2+/calmodulin-binding peptides (CCBPs) strongly inhibited the light response. By chemically exciting the cascade at various stages, we found the primary target of this effect was not in late stages of the cascade but rather at the level of G protein and PLC. That PLCdelta1 contains a calmodulin-like structure raised the possibility that PLC might be directly affected by CCBPs. To test this possibility, in vitro experiments were conducted on purified PLC. The activity of this enzyme was strongly inhibited by CCBPs and also inhibited by calmodulin itself. Our results suggest that the calmodulin-like region of PLC has an important role in regulating this enzyme.",Excluded

The patients were RPA (recursive partitioning analysis) class I, II, and III in 11.2%, 69.6%, and 18.4% of the cases, respectively; RPA class II-a, II-b, and II-c in 8.3%, 24.8%, and 66.9% of the cases, respectively; and with GPA (graded prognostic assessment) scores of 0-1.0, 1.5-2.0, 2.5-3.0, and 3.5-4.0 in 35%, 27.5%, 18.2%, and 8.6% of the cases, respectively.RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) times according to RPA class I, II, and III were 20.1, 5.1, and 1.3 months, respectively (P<.0001); according to RPA class II-a, II-b, II-c: 9.1, 8.9, and 4.0 months, respectively (P<.0001); and according to GPA score 0-1.0, 1.5-2.0, 2.5-3.0, and 3.5-4.0: 2.5, 4.4, 9.0, and 19.1 months, respectively (P<.0001). By multivariate analysis, the favorable independent prognostic factors for survival were as follows: for gastrointestinal tumor, a high Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (P=.0003) and an absence of extracranial metastases (ECM) (P=.003); for kidney cancer, few BM (P=.002); for melanoma, few BM (P=.01), an absence of ECM (P=.002), and few ECM (P=.0002); for lung cancer, age (P=.007), a high KPS (P<.0001), an absence of ECM (P<.0001), few ECM and BM (P<.0001 and P=.0006, respectively), and control of the primary tumor (P=.004); and for breast cancer, age (P=.001), a high KPS (P=.007), control of the primary tumor (P=.05), and few ECM and BM (P=.01 and P=.0002, respectively).

2640,"Cerebral Cortex Regions Selectively Vulnerable to Radiation Dose-Dependent Atrophy PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: Neurologic deficits after brain radiation therapy (RT) typically involve decline in higher-order cognitive functions such as attention and memory rather than sensory defects or paralysis. We sought to determine whether areas of the cortex critical to cognition are selectively vulnerable to radiation dose-dependent atrophy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We measured change in cortical thickness in 54 primary brain tumor patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT. The study patients underwent high-resolution, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted; T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, FLAIR) before RT and 1 year afterward. Semiautomated software was used to segment anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex for each patient. Cortical thickness was measured for each region before RT and 1 year afterward. Two higher-order cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were tested for association between radiation dose and cortical thinning: entorhinal (memory) and inferior parietal (attention/memory). For comparison, 2 primary cortex ROIs were also tested: pericalcarine (vision) and paracentral lobule (somatosensory/motor). Linear mixed-effects analyses were used to test all other cortical regions for significant radiation dose-dependent thickness change. Statistical significance was set at alpha = 0.05 using 2-tailed tests.RESULTS: Cortical atrophy was significantly associated with radiation dose in the entorhinal (P=.01) and inferior parietal ROIs (P=.02). By contrast, no significant radiation dose-dependent effect was found in the primary cortex ROIs (pericalcarine and paracentral lobule). In the whole-cortex analysis, 9 regions showed significant radiation dose-dependent atrophy, including areas responsible for memory, attention, and executive function (P<=.002).CONCLUSIONS: Areas of cerebral cortex important for higher-order cognition may be most vulnerable to radiation-related atrophy. This is consistent with clinical observations that brain radiation patients experience deficits in domains of memory, executive function, and attention. Correlations of regional cortical atrophy with domain-specific cognitive functioning in prospective trials are warranted.",Excluded

Patients were treated with pituitary surgery and/or irradiation, with and without the addition of drugs. Patients treated with drugs alone were not included. Following combined surgery, radiotherapy and bromocriptine therapy only two acromegalic patients had persistently raised growth hormone levels and five continued to be hyperprolactinaemic. Pituitary irradiation alone was associated with the development of hypothyroidism in three of eight patients. A delayed but significant fall in free thyroxine index (p less than 0.01) was noted in patients receiving 4500 cGy radiotherapy and surgery. Four patients also developed delayed ACTH deficiency at times varying from one to six years after treatment.

(90)Y-Dodecanetetraacetic acid-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (SMT 487) is an SSTR radiopharmaceutical currently under investigation as a therapeutic option for neuroendocrine tumors. Although there are a variety of methods for evaluating response to a given cancer therapy, an important indicator of success is the impact on the clinical status of the patient. The purpose of this work was to develop a semiquantitative method and assess the clinical effectiveness of (90)Y-SMT 487 therapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors.METHODS: A scoring system was developed to evaluate clinical response that included the following parameters: weight, health status score (determined by the patient), Karnofsky score, and tumor-related symptoms.RESULTS: We applied this scoring system to 21 patients who had completed 3 cycles of therapy with (90)Y-SMT 487. Fourteen of the 21 showed a favorable clinical response, whereas 5 were clinically stable after treatment and 2 showed evidence of clinical progression. There was also a significant reduction in the amount of octreotide being used after completion of (90)Y-SMT 487 therapy in the 20 patients who were on this medication.CONCLUSION: Using this scoring method, (90)Y-SMT 487 appears effective in improving the clinical status of patients with (111)In-pentetreotide-positive neuroendocrine tumors.",Excluded

1145,"p53 tumor suppressor protein regulates the levels of huntingtin gene expression The p53 protein is a transcription factor that integrates various cellular stress signals. The accumulation of the mutant huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract plays a central role in the pathology of human Huntington's disease. We found that the huntingtin gene contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and p53 binds to these elements both in vivo and in vitro. p53 activation in cultured human cells, either by a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 protein or by gamma-irradiation (gamma-irradiation), increases huntingtin mRNA and protein expression. Similarly, murine huntingtin also contains multiple putative p53-responsive elements and its expression is induced by p53 activation in cultured cells. Moreover, gamma-irradiation, which activates p53, increases huntingtin gene expression in the striatum and cortex of mouse brain, the major pathological sites for Huntington's disease, in p53+/+ but not the isogenic p53-/- mice. These results demonstrate that p53 protein can regulate huntingtin expression at transcriptional level, and suggest that a p53 stress response could be a modulator of the process of Huntington's disease.",Included

The purpose of this study was to assess regional CBF in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus compared with healthy controls using the noninvasive quantitative arterial spin-labeling MR imaging technique. A secondary aim was to compare the correlation between symptom severity and CBF.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differences in regional cerebral perfusion between patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and healthy controls were investigated with pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling perfusion MR imaging. Twenty-one consecutive patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and 21 age- and sex-matched randomly selected healthy controls from the population registry were prospectively included. The controls did not differ from patients with respect to selected vascular risk factors. Twelve different anatomic ROIs were manually drawn on coregistered FLAIR images. The Holm-Bonferroni correction was applied to statistical analyses.RESULTS: In patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, perfusion was reduced in the periventricular white matter (P < .001), lentiform nucleus (P < .001), and thalamus (P < .001) compared with controls. Cognitive function in patients correlated with CBF in the periventricular white matter (r = 0.60, P < .01), cerebellum (r = 0.63, P < .01), and pons (r = 0.71, P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Using pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling, we could confirm findings of a reduced perfusion in the periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamus in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus previously observed with other imaging techniques.",Excluded
807,"Measuring inflammation in brains of NFL players using [11c]DPA-713 PET Background: Former National Football League (NFL) players have higher rates of delayed neurological, cognitive and affective impairments. Those impairments have been attributed to pathologic effects of repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI), characterized by shearing of neuronal axons and inflammatory response. We recently showed that [11C]DPA-713 PET-based neuroimaging (DPA-PET) is a promising tool to quantify increased expression of translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of brain injury and repair, in former NFL players. Here we sought to use DPA-PET in active and recently retired NFL players to test for changes in binding to TSPO. Method(s): We quantified regional distribution (VT) of TSPO using DPA-PET in the brains of a novel set of nine active and recently retired NFL players and eight age-matched, athletic, healthy controls. Diffusion tensor imaging was also completed to evaluate white matter changes in the brains of these individuals. Result(s): Using two-way ANOVA with cohort (NFL players, controls) and TSPO genotype as fixed factors, DPA-PET VT values were signiflcantly increased in several brain regions in NFL players compared to controls, particularly in thalamus and brainstem. We also found signiflcantly diminished fractional anisotrophy in the right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR) and signiflcantly increased mean diffusivity (MD) in bilateral PTRs. Conclusion(s): Findings from this pilot study of young NFL players support a model wherein microglial activation is an early, persistent response in select brain structures after rmTBI. DPA-PET in NFL athletes may prove useful in further characterizing the inflammatory response after rmTBI and in probing the mechanistic link to onset of cognitive and affective disease.",Excluded
495,"Hairy and emc negatively regulate morphogenetic furrow progression in the Drosophila eye The initial steps of pattern formation in the developing Drosophila eye involve the coordination of cell cycles, changes in cell shape, and the specification of the R8 photoreceptor cell.

Two HLH regulatory proteins that function to suppress neuronal development in other tissues, extra macrochaetae (emc) and hairy (h), are expressed ahead of the morphogenetic furrow. While neither h nor emc is required for photoreceptor cell determination, in emc-h-clones the morphogenetic furrow and differentiated eye field advance up to eight ommatidial rows ahead of adjacent wild-type tissue.

A hand-held gamma-detecting probe was used during operation to determine whether gross tumor accumulated the radiolabeled analog and occult tumor could be detected. Positive uptake was defined as tumor/background ratios exceeding 2:1.RESULTS: The tumor in all seven patients with gross disease accumulated 125I-TYR(3)-octreotide. Occult tumor beyond that appreciated with preoperative imaging or by routine operative exploration was detected in a patient with carcinoid tumor. In the patient with the occult gastrinoma the probe detected the lesion within the duodenal bulb before duodenotomy and also predicted what proved histologically to be positive peripancreatic adenopathy. There was a single false-positive reading from the stomach in a patient with suspected carcinoid tumor in whom no tumor could be found grossly or histologically. A pancreatic mass that probed negative proved to be an adenocarcinoma of ductal origin.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-specific peptide-receptor binding can be detected in situ with 125J-TYR(3)-octreotide and a hand-held gamma-detecting probe.

This study evaluates bowel function and related quality of life in patients 2 - 4 years after hemicolectomy, comparing the results to healthy controls. Methods Eligible patients were identified from prospectively maintained colorectal databases at two teaching hospitals. Patients were recruited during regular follow up visits or by telephone interview. Patient relatives with an intact colon were recruited as controls. Study exclusion criteria were poor cognitive ability, inflammatory bowel disease, metastatic disease, previous pelvic radiation, prior colonic, stomach or small bowel resection, bypass surgery, vagotomy, an existing stoma and anal incontinence. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) questionnaire was used to assess bowel function and the EQ-5D questionnaire to assess quality of life (QOL). Parametric and non-parametric tests were used with log transformation and regression methods for skewed data. Association between EQ-5D and MSKCC scores was examined with Spearman's rank correlation. Results A total of 85 patients (mean age 69 +/- 11.2 years) and 85 controls (mean age 58.2 +/- 13.4 years) were recruited in 12 months. Patients reported a significantly higher number of bowel movements per day than controls (2 versus 1, P < 0.001). Initial analysis suggested that patients had a significantly lower total MSKCC score (group difference mean -3.1, CI -5.8 to -0.4, p = 0.02), indicating worse bowel function in the patient group. Following adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, differences in total score were no longer significant, but the patient group had a lower score for the frequency subscale and the ability to control flatus (p = 0.008 and p = < 0.001). MSKCC frequency scores were worse after right-sided resections (p = 0.03). High scores for complete emptying and the differentiation between wind and solid had a positive correlation with better QOL (p = 0.007 and 0.02 respectively). There was a nonsignificant decrease in the overall QOL (EQ-5D p = 0.6, EQ-VAS p = 0.12) following hemicolectomy compared with controls. Conclusion Colonic resection has an adverse effect on bowel frequency with worse outcomes following right hemicolectomy. Good colonic function, as assessed by the MSKCC questionnaire, is associated with better QOL.",Excluded

This may be used to quantify the high-affinity state of 5-HT2A receptors and may have the potential to quantify changes in cerebral 5-HT levels in vivo. We here investigated safety aspects related to clinical use of [11C]Cimbi-36, including radiation dosimetry and in vivo pharmacology.PROCEDURES: [11C]Cimbi-36 was injected in rats or pigs, and radiation dosimetry was examined by ex vivo dissection or with PET scanning, respectively. Based on animal data, the Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment software was used to estimate extrapolated human dosimetry for [11C]Cimbi-36. The 5-HT2A receptor agonist actions of [11C]Cimbi-36 in vivo pharmacological effects in mice elicited by increasing doses of Cimbi-36 were assessed with the head-twitch response (HTR).RESULTS: The effective dose as extrapolated from both rat and pig data was low, 7.67 and 4.88 muSv/MBq, respectively. In addition, the estimated absorbed radiation dose to human target organs did not exceed safety levels. Administration of 0.5 mg/kg Cimbi-36 leads to significant HTR compared to saline, whereas 0.05 mg/kg Cimbi-36 (doses much larger than those given in conjunction with a PET scan) did not elicit a significant HTR.CONCLUSIONS: Administration of tracer doses of [11C]Cimbi-36 does not seem to be associated with unusual radiation burden or adverse clinical effects.",Excluded

RESULT(S): Relative to normal bodyweight (BW) when standing upright, increments of 10 mmHg LBNP from 0 to 40 mmHg while supine induced axial loading corresponding to 0%, 13 +/- 3%, 41 +/- 5%, 75 +/- 11%, and 125 +/- 22% BW, respectively. Furthermore, LBNP reduced IJVa from 1.12 +/- 0.3 cm2 to 0.67 +/- 0.2, 0.50 +/- 0.1, 0.35 +/- 0.1, and 0.31 +/- 0.1 cm2, respectively. LBNP of 30 and 40 mmHg reduced cardiac stroke volume and increased heart rate while cardiac output and mean arterial pressure were unaffected. During 2 h of supine rest at 20 mmHg LBNP, temperature and humidity inside the suit were unchanged (23 +/- 1degreeC; 47 +/- 3%, respectively).DISCUSSION: The flexible GravitySuit at 20 mmHg LBNP comfortably induced mechanical loading and desired fluid displacement while maintaining the mobility of hips and knee joints. The GravitySuit may provide a feasible method to apply low-level, long-term LBNP without interfering with daily activity during spaceflight to provide an integrative countermeasure.Petersen LG, Hargens A, Bird EM, Ashari N, Saalfeld J, Petersen JCG.

1742,"Regulation of prostaglandin E2 synthesis after brain irradiation PURPOSE: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels seen after radiation treatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE2 production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE2 production and PGES expression.RESULTS: As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE2 levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE2 seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE2 production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities.",Included
2542,"Impact of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with central neurocytoma: A multicentric international analysis Background: Central neurocytoma (CN) is a rare tumor accounting for <0.5% of all intracranial tumors. Surgery +/- radiotherapy is the mainstay treatment. This international multicentric study aims to evaluate the outcomes of CNs patients after multimodal therapies and identify predictive factors. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively identified 33 patients with CN treated between 2005 and 2019. Treatment characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Result(s): All patients with CN underwent surgical resection. Radiotherapy was delivered in 19 patients. The median radiation dose was 54 Gy (range, 50-60 Gy). The median follow-up time was 56 months. The 5-year OS and 5-year PFS were 90% and 76%, respectively. Patients who received radiotherapy had a significantly longer PFS than patients without RT (p = 0.004) and a trend towards longer OS. In addition, complete response after treatments was associated with longer PFS (p = 0.07). Conclusion(s): Using RT seems to be associated with longer survival rates with an acceptable toxicity profile. Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included
2986,"Thymoquinone reduces oxidative and nitrosative stress in tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation Introduction: Head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy suffer severe side-effects during and following their treatment. Efforts to decrease toxicity of irradiation to normal tissue, organs and cells have led to a search for cytoprotective agent. Investigations for effective and non-toxic compounds with radioprotective capability led to increasing interest in antioxidant such as thymoquinone (TQ). Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the radioprotective effects of TQ on oxidant/antioxidant systems in the tongue-tissue of rats exposed to total cranial irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of TQ administered by either orogastric tube or intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Result(s): Tongue glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the control and sham control groups were significantly increased when compared to the irradiation (IR) group and IR plus TQ groups. Nitric oxide (NO*), peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, xantine oxidase (XO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities significantly increased in the IR group when compared to the control and sham control groups. Conclusion(s): Results show that TQ has the radioprotective, antioxidant effects and free radical scavenging activity. Therapy with antioxidants may lead to the increase in the antioxidant defense system and thus, may decrease the clinical symptoms in radiation therapy.",Included

Data from 86 centers across the world were analyzed. All CT interactions were automatically collected and transmitted to the CT vendor during two 6-week periods immediately before and 2 weeks after implementation of ATVS. A total of 164 323 unique CT studies were analyzed. Studies were categorized by body region and type of examination. Tube voltage and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) were compared between examinations performed with ATVS and those performed before ATVS implementation. Descriptive statistical methods and multilevel linear regression models were used for analysis.RESULTS: Across all types of CT examinations and body regions, CTDIvol was 14.7% lower in examinations performed with ATVS (n = 30 313) than in those performed before ATVS implementation (n = 79 275). Relative reductions in mean CTDIvol were most notable for temporal bone CT (-56.1%), peripheral runoff CT angiography (-48.6%), CT of the paranasal sinus (-39.6%), cerebral or carotid CT angiography (-36.4%), coronary CT angiography (-25.1%), and head CT (-23.9%). An increase in mean CTDIvol was observed for renal stone protocols (26.2%) and thoracic or lumbar spine examinations (6.6%). In the multilevel model with fixed effects ATVS and examination type, and the interaction of these variables and the random effect country, a significant influence on CTDIvol for all fixed efects was revealed (ATVS, P = .0031; examination type, P < .0001; interaction term, P < .0001).CONCLUSION: ATVS significantly reduces radiation dose across most, but not all, body regions and types of CT examinations.",Excluded
1080,"Carbamylated erythropoietin reduces radiosurgically-induced brain injury Gamma knife radiosurgery is an attractive noninvasive treatment of brain tumors and vascular malformations that minimizes collateral tissue damage. However, exposure of normal tissue to even low-dose radiation triggers a cascade of acute and chronic injury and potentially significant morbidity and mortality. Because many irradiated patients now survive for years, identifying methods to prevent radiotherapy-induced collateral tissue damage is a major focus of current research. Erythropoietin (EPO), a cytokine produced locally by many tissues in response to injury, antagonizes apoptosis, reduces inflammation, and promotes healing. Systemic administration of recombinant EPO, widely used for treatment of anemia, provides robust protection from numerous insults in a variety of tissues, including the brain. Although irradiation injury is likely sensitive to EPO, the hematopoietic activity of EPO is undesirable in this setting, increasing erythrocyte number and predisposing to thrombosis. To avoid these potential adverse effects, we developed carbamylated EPO (CEPO) which does not stimulate the bone marrow. In this study, we show that CEPO (50 microg kg(-1) intraperitoneally) improves functional outcome when administered to adult rats just before, and then once daily for 10 d after, a necrotizing dose of radiation (100 Gy) to the right striatum. Immediately following irradiation, use and reflex movements of the contralateral forelimb to vibrissae stimulation were abnormal but rapidly improved in animals receiving CEPO. Moreover, histological examination revealed that the extent of brain necrosis after 90 days was reduced by approximately 50%. These findings further extend the kinds of injury for which administration of a tissue-protective cytokine provides benefit.",Excluded
1065,"Percutaneous fixation of thoracolumbar fractures. Does index level fixation help in fracture reduction and stability? Introduction: Thoracolumbar burst fractures are caused by compression injury with subsequent loss of vertebral height and development of local kyphotic deformity. The application of pedicle screws in the fractured vertebrae i.e. index level fixation, had been proven to help in reduction and correction of the local kyphotic deformity and anterior vertebral height loss with their maintenance in short segment fixation. Recently, percutaneous pedicle screws are introduced and used in the thoracolumbar fracture fixation with the proposed advantage of the less soft tissue dissection, muscle disruption and atrophy and assumed less wound related complications. Controversy remains about the ability of the percutaneous instrumentation to reduce and maintain the correction of local kyphosis and lost vertebral height caused by the fracture compared to the open instrumentation. Material(s) and Method(s): In this prospective study, thirty-eight neurologically intact patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures (T11-L2) type A3 and A4 according to AOSpine classification were treated between 2012 and 2015 with posterior pedicle screw fixation. The patients were divided into two groups, group 1 included 18 patients treated with percutaneous pedicle screws (PPS) while group 2 included 20 patients treated by standard open posterior approach with pedicle screws fixation (OPS). The operative data (blood loss, radiation exposure, operative time, and cost of implants) were compared between the two groups. The patients' radiographs were assessed for local kyphotic angle (LKA) and anterior vertebral body height (AVH) compression and compared for correction and maintenance. The patients' visual analogue scale (VAS) for back pain and treatment related complications were reported. Result(s): The blood loss was the only operative parameter that was significantly less in the PPS group and although the operative time decreased in the PPS group by the increase in learning curve, the other operative data show significant difference in favor of the OPS group. Post-operative correction of the local vertebral compression assessed radiologically with LKA and AVH significantly improved in both groups compared to the pre-operative degree and was maintained till the end of follow up. No major wound related complication was found in both groups. VAS of back pain was significantly reduced in PPS group in the early postoperative follow up than the OPS, but both groups at the end showed a significant improvement between early post-operative and late follow up. Conclusion(s): Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation is a good minimally invasive modality in the management of thoracolumbar fractures and the application of screw in the fractured vertebrae improves the correction and maintenance of local kyphosis in short segment fixation. Cost effectiveness of this technique must be evaluated thoroughly with the final and late outcome of this management. More randomized controlled and multicenter studies are needed to support these findings.",Excluded
2138,"The Impact of body-only proton radiation on immune-CNS communication Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an established treatment for many hematological disorders including lymphomas and leukemias. Although the prognosis after HSCT has historically been poor, associated with high mortality rates, advances in treatment have led to increases in long-term survival and, consequently, an increased risk for neuropsychological dysfunction. Roughly 40% of all allogeneic HSCTs performed in 2006-2010 involved total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning. Previously, we reported that many TBI-induced changes in splenic phagocytic populations were mitigated by chlorisondamine (CHL), a non-selective nicotinic blocker that crosses the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we characterized the effects of body-only proton irradiation (excluding brain) and CHL on the response to a bacterial challenge in 8- to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Mice were given CHL (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and irradiated (0 or 3 Gy) 60-90 min later. Ten days post-irradiation, mice were inoculated with 5e7 CFU of Escherichia coli (i.p.) and euthanized 90-120 min later. We characterized blood and splenic leukocyte population distributions (flow cytometry and hematology), cytokine levels (multiplexed cytokine analysis) and oxidative burst capacity. Radiation decreased virtually all splenic leukocyte counts while increasing oxidative burst capacity. In the blood, radiation decreased lymphocytes but increased innate subsets. Sympathetic blockade did not counter most of these radiation effects. This suggests that the disruptive effect of TBI on brain-immune communication is dependent on direct exposure to the brain.",Included
2847,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapies (PRRTs): Which are the dosimetric data for the patients? Introduction: NeuroEndocrine Tumours (NETs) belong to a relatively rare class of neoplasms. Nonetheless, their prevalence has increased significantly during the last decades. Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) therapeutic effect is based on the binding of radiolabelled somatostatin analogue peptides with NETs' somatostatin receptors, resulting in internal irradiation of tumours. Pre-therapeutic patient-specific dosimetry is essential for a treatment course with high levels of safety and efficacy. This study reviews the methods and dosimetric results of PRRT dosimetry presented in the literature. Focus is given on data concerning the therapeutic somatostatin analogue radiopeptides <sup>111</sup>In-[DTPA<sup>0</sup>,DPhe<sup>1</sup>]- octreotide (<sup>111</sup>In-DTPA-octreotide), <sup>90</sup>Y-[DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>]-octreotide (<sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC) and <sup>177</sup>Lu-[DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>,Thr<sup>8</sup>]-octreotide (<sup>177</sup>Lu- DOTATATE). Material(s) and Method(s): This study included papers that have performed dosimetry in adult patients for the therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals <sup>111</sup>In- DTPA-octreotide, <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC and <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE. Furthermore, papers presented herein were published during the last 15 years (1999 - 2013), with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE studies being published during the last 4 years (2010 - 2013). Additionally, selection was limited to papers providing dosimetric data for at least two regions of interest. Result(s): Dosimetric results are provided for tumors, kidneys, red marrow, liver and spleen, Following Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) committee formalism, dosimetric analysis demonstrates large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake, with kidneys and bone marrow being the critical organs. Results are dependent on the image acquisition and processing protocol, as well as the dosimetric imaging radiopharmaceutical. Discussion(s): The large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake stresses the need for personalized therapy planning. Patient-specific dosimetry in PRRT is therefore needed, in order for the fixed dose regimens to be replaced with patient-tailored therapy planning. Kidney absorbed doses are higher in PRRT with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC, allowing for higher <sup>177</sup>Lu activities to be administered in <sup>177</sup>Lu- DOTATATE therapies. In order for such dosimetric techniques to be systematically implemented in a busy clinical environment, dosimetry software programmes may provide an essential tool, as they help in making the procedures less time-intensive.",Excluded
2379,"Cellular response of meningioma towards retinoid acid and ionizing radiation Meningiomas are the second most common primary brain tumors and represent one-third of all primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. Currently, most meninigiomas are effectively managed via surgical resection. Recurrent meningiomas and unresectable, residual tumors after partial resection are treated with radiation. However, patients who are not suitable for surgery or radiation therapy or whose tumors recur after such treatment have limited therapeutic options. Retinoids are a class of compounds structurally related to vitamin A. Retinoic acid (RA) has been widely used to treat dermatological disease. Recently, RA, the active derivative of vitamin A and the first candidate diffusible morphogen in vertebrates, was used as a potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agent. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of RA on meningiomas when administered in combinination with ionizing radiation. The early data showed that both all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 13-cis-retinoic aciecan inhibited cell proliferation at high concentrations (10 mM) but had little cell proliferation inhibition activity at low concentrations (10 nM and 1 mM, respectively), thereby implicating the role of RA in meningioma clinical treatment. Neither ATRA nor 13-cis-RA influenced cell cycle progression. Further study showed that 10-mM ATRA exposure led to increased cell death after irradiation; however, 10-nM or 1-mMATRA pretreatment enhanced meningioma cell survival following irradiation. Comet assay showed that RA reduced the G2/M phase arrest caused by irradiation, thereby suggesting that DNA repair processes are involved in the activity of RA when combined with radiation.",Excluded

Method(s): As of February 2002, a concurrent CRT protocol was launched for patients with confirmed diagnosis of SCLC-LD. All patients treated in accordance with the protocol were reviewed. LD staging was documented by using computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, upper abdomen, and brain and, in most cases, 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET). The CRT protocol consisted of thoracic radiotherapy delivered up to a dose of 50 Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy, starting concurrently with the second of four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin 60 mg/ m2 d1, Q3w and etoposide 120 mg/m2 d1-3, Q3w). Radiotherapy was given using IF-RT, targeted to the tumor, PET positive nodes and nodes >1cm in smallest diameter on CT-scan. Response after CRT was evaluated with CT-scan. Patients with a (near) complete response (nCR) received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) up to 30Gy/2Gy within 6 weeks after completion of CRT. Result(s): Between 2/2002 and 2/2009, 53 patients were treated according to this CRT protocol: female/male 15/38; median age: 58 years (range 39-72); clinical TNM: cT1-4N0-3M0. Pathology was obtained using bronchoscopy/TBNA (72%), mediastinoscopy (26%) or thoracotomy (2%). PETstaging was performed in 41/53 patients (77%): 33 isolated PET, 8 PET-CT. CRT was given according to protocol in 50 patients, 2 received cisplatinpemetrexed as first chemotherapy cycle, 1 started radiotherapy with the 3rd chemotherapy cycle. Median time between start of treatment and end of radiotherapy was 59 days (range 53-73). of the 32 patients in nCR, 30 received PCI 30Gy/2Gy, 2 of them 30Gy/3Gy. Ten out of 21 patients in partial remission (PR) received PCI (8: 30Gy/2Gy; 1:30Gy/3Gy; and 1: 20Gy/4Gy). of the total group, 20 patients did not relapse/progress. In the remaining 33 patients, site of first relapse/progression was locoregional in 10, distant in 15 and both combined in 8. of the primary loco-regional relapses, 3 were in-field (2 were salvaged by surgery) and 3 partially in- and out-of-field. Only one patient developed an isolated out-of-field relapse. Three PR patients progressed loco-regionally before developing metastases. After a median (mean) follow-up of 24 (38) months, median overall and progression-free survival were 28,3 and 26 months, respectively. Overall survival at 1, 2 and 5 years was 81,1%, 58,4% and 40,6%. At the same time points, respectively 85,5%, 63,1% and 52,6% of patients were free of loco-regional recurrence, respectively. Conclusion(s): The outcome of concomitant chemotherapy with IF-RT (up to 50Gy/2Gy) starting with the second chemotherapy cycle, compares favorably with results from other series, which may in part be due to the dedicated staging strategy resulting in truly limited SCLC. The low number of isolated local relapses seems to support the use of IF-RT, provided that PET is used for diagnosis and treatment planning. The observation that a relatively high proportion of patients fails to reach nCR, suggests that higher radiotherapy doses may be the way to further improve the outcome.",Excluded

2442,"Structural basis of microtubule severing by the hereditary spastic paraplegia protein spastin Spastin, the most common locus for mutations in hereditary spastic paraplegias, and katanin are related microtubule-severing AAA ATPases involved in constructing neuronal and non-centrosomal microtubule arrays and in segregating chromosomes. The mechanism by which spastin and katanin break and destabilize microtubules is unknown, in part owing to the lack of structural information on these enzymes. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the Drosophila spastin AAA domain and provide a model for the active spastin hexamer generated using small-angle X-ray scattering combined with atomic docking. The spastin hexamer forms a ring with a prominent central pore and six radiating arms that may dock onto the microtubule. Helices unique to the microtubule-severing AAA ATPases surround the entrances to the pore on either side of the ring, and three highly conserved loops line the pore lumen. Mutagenesis reveals essential roles for these structural elements in the severing reaction. Peptide and antibody inhibition experiments further show that spastin may dismantle microtubules by recognizing specific features in the carboxy-terminal tail of tubulin. Collectively, our data support a model in which spastin pulls the C terminus of tubulin through its central pore, generating a mechanical force that destabilizes tubulin-tubulin interactions within the microtubule lattice. Our work also provides insights into the structural defects in spastin that arise from mutations identified in hereditary spastic paraplegia patients. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.",Excluded

2591,"Abnormalities of thalamic volume and shape detected in fetally irradiated rhesus monkeys with high dimensional brain mapping Background: Prior research has indicated neuroanatomical abnormalities of the thalamus in schizophrenia. To study the possible pathogenesis, an animal model of neurodevelopmental thalamic damage has been developed by applying low-dose radiation to rhesus monkeys in early gestation. Irradiated monkeys sacrificed as infants demonstrate neuronal losses in specific thalamic nuclei and decreases in cortical neuropil. Method(s): Magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult Rhesus monkeys exposed to irradiation during thalamic neurogenesis (E33-42), after thalamic neurogenesis (E70-81), and in nonirradiated control animals. High dimensional brain mapping was used to compare thalamic volumes and shape characteristics in the three groups of animals. Result(s): Animals exposed to irradiation at E33-42 showed a significant bilateral loss of thalamic volumes (> 20%) compared with controls and with animals irradiated at E70-81 when total brain volume was used as a covariate in the analysis. Thalamic volume loss was associated with a nonuniform deformation of thalamic shape. Conclusion(s): A first-trimester, neurodevelopmental insult in the nonhuman primate during thalamic neurogenesis produces a complex pattern of thalamic volume loss and shape deformation in adulthood. Low-dose irradiation of the fetal primate may be useful for modeling key features of the pathology described in schizophrenic patients. © 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",Included
3467,"PIDD Mediates Radiation-Induced Microglia Activation Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is the most common adverse effect that occurs after cranial radiation therapy (CRT). We have previously reported that CRT-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in brain tissues and inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampus might be caused by microglial activation and may play an important role in RIBI. In this study we examined the role of p53-induced protein with a death domain (PIDD) in radiation-induced activation of BV-2 cells. BV-2 cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotide control mRNA or antisense oligonucleotide-targeted PIDD mRNA and were sham or 16 Gy irradiated. The state of microglia and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Findings from this study suggest that silencing PIDD expression could inhibit microglial activation by downregulating the PIDD-C/NF-kappabeta transcription pathway. PIDD acts as a critical switcher between the NF-kappabeta transcription pathway and radiation-induced apoptosis. Given these findings, this study offers a potential novel approach to further combination treatment of RIBI.",Included

There were 12 men and 5 women with a median age of 56 years (range 24-83 years). There were 10 lung carcinomas, 4 esophagus carcinomas , 1 liver cancer, 1 breast cancer, and 1 kidney carcinoma . 6 had squamous cell carcinoma, 8 were adenocarcinoma, 3 others respectively. All patients suffered varying degrees of pain before seed implantation, ranging from 1 to 9 on the NRS. Mean NRS scores before implantation was 6.88 +/- 2.25 respectively. Regarding neurologic function, 2 grade Bs, 2 grade Cs, 3 grade Ds and 10 grade Es. All patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases had received conventional EBRT. During the procedure, patients remained in a prone position to facilitate CT guidance. We measured the pedicle angle and the distance of the puncture point. The depth of the puncture point to the pedicle was also borne in mind. Needles were inserted through the anterior portion of the lateral images, in the interval between the pedicle and the vertebral body, or with a pedicle or paraspinal approach, respectively. Seeds were implanted 1.0 cm from the spinal cord, to minimize radiation damage. Immediately after the procedure, a CT scan was obtained to confirm the location of the seeds in case of any need for supplementary implantation. The number of 125I seeds implanted ranged from 18 to 62 (median 30) with specific activity of 0.5-0.8 mCi (median 0.75 mCi). The post-plan showed that the actuarial D90 of 125I seeds were 60.5-154 Gy(median 106 Gy). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 59 months (median 7 months). The local control rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): For all patients, the 1-,2-year overall survival rates were 74.8%, 49.8%, respectively, with a median of 15 months (range, 1-59 months), the 1-, 2-year local control rates were 54.1%, 36.1%, respectively, with a median of 14 months (range, 1-59 months).

1023,"Control of recollection by slow gamma dominating mid-frequency gamma in hippocampus CA1 Behavior is used to assess memory and cognitive deficits in animals like Fmr1-null mice that model Fragile X Syndrome, but behavior is a proxy for unknown neural events that define cognitive variables like recollection. We identified an electrophysiological signature of recollection in mouse dorsal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampus. During a shocked-place avoidance task, slow gamma (SG) (30-50 Hz) dominates mid-frequency gamma (MG) (70-90 Hz) oscillations 2-3 s before successful avoidance, but not failures. Wild-type (WT) but not Fmr1-null mice rapidly adapt to relocating the shock; concurrently, SG/MG maxima (SGdom) decrease in WT but not in cognitively inflexible Fmr1-null mice. During SGdom, putative pyramidal cell ensembles represent distant locations; during place avoidance, these are avoided places. During shock relocation, WT ensembles represent distant locations near the currently correct shock zone, but Fmr1-null ensembles represent the formerly correct zone. These findings indicate that recollection occurs when CA1 SG dominates MG and that accurate recollection of inappropriate memories explains Fmr1-null cognitive inflexibility.",Excluded
1119,"Environmental enrichment enhances neurogenesis and improves functional outcome after cranial irradiation Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for brain tumors but it can cause delayed progressive cognitive decline and memory deficits. Previous studies suggested that this neurocognitive dysfunction might be linked to the impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, little is known regarding how to reduce the cognitive impairment caused by radiation therapy. To investigate whether environmental enrichment (EE) promotes neurogenesis and cognitive function after irradiation, irradiated gerbils were housed in EE for 2 months and evaluated by neurobehavioral testing for learning and memory function, and immunohistochemical analysis for neurogenesis. Our results demonstrated that even relatively low doses (5-10 Gy) of irradiation could acutely abolish precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus by more than 90%. This reduction in precursor proliferation was persistent and led to a significant decline in the granule cell population 9 months later. EE housing enhanced the number of newborn neurons and increased residual neurogenesis. EE also significantly increased the total number of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, irradiated animals after EE housing showed a significant improvement in spatial learning and memory during the water-maze test and in rotorod motor learning over a 5-day training paradigm. In conclusion, EE has a positive impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and functional recovery in irradiated adult gerbils. Our data suggest that there is still a considerable amount of plasticity remaining in the hippocampal progenitor cells in adult animals after radiation injury, which can become a target of therapeutic intervention for radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction.",Included

Plans were delivered on a Novalis TX, using the 6XSRS energy mode with a D/R of 1000 MU/min and a HDMLC multileaf collimator (2.5 mm leaf size at isocenter). Using a Lucy 3D QA Phantom (Standard Imaging, Inc., USA), dose distributions were recalculated for each plan and the absolute isocenter dose was checked for each treatment field in the phantom, both with a DD (PTW 60003 Diamond Detector PTW, Freiburg, Germany) and with a PSD (Exradin W1 scintillator, Standard Imaging, Inc., USA). The detectors were positioned in the same way in the phantom, each with its specific insert, both with their longitudinal axis parallel the radiation beam when the gantry is at zero angle (see figure). This position was used to acquire the CT images of the phantom, define the isocenter location and the setup measurements. The figure shows also that the DD creates artifacts in the CT scan caused by the metallic connectors of the detector which lead to dose under-dosage estimation for table position 0degree (the artifact represents a region of density higher than the acrylic material of the phantom which at table position zero falls on the beam path with a consequent larger than real radiation absorption and therefore lowers the dose calculated at isocenter). This effect is not present for the PSD. The DD, because of its small detector volume, is being used as our gold standard for fixed dose rates treatments. Furthermore our DD presents a well centered sensitive detector volume, as measured on X-ray images, of about 0.002 cc against 0.0024 cc of the PSD. Result(s): The mean dose ratio (measured/expected) over all arcs for the DD and PSD was 1.020 (SD 0.035) and 1.020 (SD 0.025) respectively. Excluding DCA with table rotations at 0degree (5 arcs) the mean dose ratio was 1.014 (SD 0.022) and 1.021 (SD 0.026) respectively for the DD and PSD. The mean ratio PSD/DD of the dose readings distribution over all arcs and excluding zero table positions was 1.001 (SD 0.026) and 1.006 (SD 0.014) respectively. Conclusion(s): The Exradin W1 Scintillator seems to be suitable for pretreatment QA of typical clinical MLC based stereotactic radio surgery plans, with equivalent MLC field sizes starting from 7.5 mm. Furthermore, the Exradin W1 Scintillator because of its water equivalence does not cause any dose perturbations. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
435,"Patient and staff doses in interventional neuroradiology Radiation doses for interventional examinations are generally high and therefore necessitate dose monitoring for patients and staff. Relating the staff dose to a patient dose index, such as dose-area product (DAP), could be quite useful for dose comparisons. In this study, DAP and skin doses of 57 patients, who underwent neurointerventional examinations, were measured simultaneously with staff doses. Although skin doses were comparable with the literature data, higher DAP values of 215 and 188.6 Gy cm<sup>2</sup> were measured for the therapeutical cerebral and carotid examinations, respectively, owing to the use of biplane system and complexity of the procedure. Mean staff doses for eye, finger and thyroid were measured as 80.6, 77.6 and 28.8 muGy per procedure. The mean effective dose per procedure for the radiologists was 32 muSv.

1116,"Alpha-Phenyl-n-tert-butyl-nitrone attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced neuronal injury in the neonatal rat brain Although white matter damage is a fundamental neuropathological feature of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), the motor and cognitive deficits observed later in infants with PVL indicate the possible involvement of cerebral neuronal dysfunction. Using a previously developed rat model of white matter injury induced by cerebral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, we investigated whether LPS exposure also results in neuronal injury in the neonatal brain and whether alpha-phenyl-n-tert-butyl-nitrone (PBN), an antioxidant, offers protection against LPS-induced neuronal injury. A stereotactic intracerebral injection of LPS (1 mg/kg) was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day 5) and control rats were injected with sterile saline. LPS exposure resulted in axonal and neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex as indicated by elevated expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein, altered axonal length and width, and increased size of cortical neuronal nuclei. LPS exposure also caused loss of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental areas of the rat brain. Treatments with PBN (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced LPS-induced neuronal and axonal damage. The protection of PBN was associated with an attenuation of oxidative stress induced by LPS as indicated by the reduced number of 4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde or nitrotyrosine positive cells in the cortical area following LPS exposure, and with the reduction in microglial activation stimulated by LPS. The finding that an inflammatory environment may cause both white matter and neuronal injury in the neonatal brain supports the possible anatomical correlate for the intellectual deficits and the other cortical and deep gray neuronal dysfunctions associated with PVL. The protection of PBN may indicate the potential usefulness of antioxidants for treatment of these neuronal dysfunctions.",Excluded
1914,"Growth factor gene-modified mesenchymal stem cells in tissue regeneration There have been marked changes in the field of stem cell therapeutics in recent years, with many clinical trials having been conducted to date in an effort to treat myriad diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the cell type most frequently utilized in stem cell therapeutic and tissue regenerative strategies, and have been used with excellent safety to date. Unfortunately, these MSCs have limited ability to engraft and survive, reducing their clinical utility. MSCs are able to secrete growth factors that can support the regeneration of tissues, and engineering MSCs to express such growth factors can improve their survival, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue reconstructing abilities. As such, it is likely that such genetically modified MSCs may represent the next stage of regenerative therapy. Indeed, increasing volumes of preclinical research suggests that such modified MSCs expressing growth factors can effectively treat many forms of tissue damage. In the present review, we survey recent approaches to producing and utilizing growth factor gene-modified MSCs in the context of tissue repair and discuss its prospects for clinical application.

However, concerns have been raised about potential long-term side effects, including cerebrovascular events (CVEs) and secondary intracranial tumors.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality in irradiated (IRR) NFPA patients, compared with NFPA patients who were not irradiated (non-IRR).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The study cohort included 806 patients with a NFPA from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults, a nationwide long-term surveillance study in severe GH-deficient adult patients. IRR patients (n = 456) were compared with non-IRR patients (n = 350).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CVEs, secondary intracranial tumors, and mortality were measured.RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects developed a CVE. In men, but not in women, the incidence of a CVE was significantly higher in IRR patients than in non-IRR patients (hazard ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 1.31-6.79). A secondary intracranial tumor developed in five IRR patients and two non-IRR patients. After adjustment for age, radiotherapy was not associated with mortality.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of secondary intracranial tumors and mortality did not differ between IRR and non-IRR patients. However, a CVE was found significantly more frequently in IRR men but not in women. Further research into the long-term effects of cranial radiotherapy seems mandatory. The potential risks of radiotherapy have to be taken into account when radiotherapy is considered in NFPA patients, and long-term follow-up is recommended.",Included

ON included optic neuritis (NNO) and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). For each subject, the PLR was recorded, to red, yellow, green, and blue stimuli for durations of 4 and 12 s, and for stimulus intensities of 4 lx and 28 lx.RESULTS: Comparison between control and RP or ON patient results showed that responses after stimulus onset were significantly different for most stimulus conditions, but the post-stimulus amplitudes at 3 s and 7 s after light extinction were not. On the other hand, the difference between the ON and RP groups was significant only for post-stimuli time-points and only for blue stimuli. Differences between responses to blue and red were significantly different, predominantly at post stimulus time-points. A ROC analysis revealed that the maximal constriction amplitudes to a 4 lx, 4 s yellow stimulus are significantly different in ON vs RP patients, and the responses to a 4 s, 28 lx blue stimulus at 7 s post-stimulus are significantly different in controls vs ON vs RP patients with a high specificity.CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary light responses to blue light in healthy, RP, and ON subjects are significantly different from one another. The optimal stimuli for future protocols was found to be a 4 s blue stimulus at 28 lx, and a 4 s yellow stimulus at 4 lx.",Excluded
984,"Increased risk of ischemic stroke after radiotherapy on the neck in patients younger than 60 years PURPOSE: To estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in patients irradiated for head and neck tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of ischemic stroke was determined in 367 patients with head and neck tumors (162 larynx carcinomas, 114 pleomorphic adenomas, and 91 parotid carcinomas) who had been treated with local radiotherapy (RT) at an age younger than 60 years. Relative risk (RR) of ischemic stroke was determined by comparison with population rates from a stroke-incidence register, adjusted for sex and age. Other risk factors for stroke (hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus [DM]) were registered. The median follow-up time after RT was 7.7 years (3,011 person-years of follow-up).RESULTS: Fourteen cases of stroke occurred (expected, 2.5; RR, 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1 to 9.4): eight in patients with laryngeal carcinoma (expected,1.56; RR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 10.1), four in pleomorphic adenoma patients (expected, 0.71; RR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 14.5), and two in parotid carcinoma patients (expected, 0.24; RR, 8.5, 95% CI, 1.0 to 30.6). Five of six strokes in patients irradiated for a parotid tumor occurred at the ipsilateral side. Analysis of other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease showed hypertension and DM to cause an increase of the RR after RT. After more than 10 years' follow-up, the RR was 10.1 (95% CI, 4.4 to 20.0). The 15-year cumulative risk of stroke after RT on the neck was 12.0% (95% CI, 6.5% to 21.4%).CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate an increased risk of stroke after RT on the neck. During medical follow-up, preventive measures should be taken to reduce the impact of the risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, to decrease stroke in these patients.",Included

The aim of this study was to determine the relation between changes in myelin basic protein (MBP) levels during the acute and subacute phases of central nervous system injury following whole-brain radiation and delayed demyelination in the radiation-injured brain tissue. Methods. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with single fractions of 2, 10, or 30 Gy of whole-brain radiation. The authors measured MBP gene expression and protein levels in the brain tissue by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 1 week and 1-3 months following irradiation to monitor myelin changes in the brain. Demyelination was determined with Luxol fast blue myelin staining and routine histopathological and electron microscopy examination of injured brain tissue. The changes in MBP levels in the different animal groups at specific time points were correlated with demyelination in corresponding dose groups. Results. At 1 month after applying the 10 and 30 Gy of radiation, MBP mRNA expression showed a transient but significant decrease, followed by recovery to baseline levels at 3 months after treatment. The MBP levels were decreased by only 70-75% at 1 month after 10 and 30 Gy of radiation. At 2-3 months after applying the higher dose of 30 Gy, however, the MBP levels continued to decline, and typical demyelination changes were observed with myelin staining and ultrastructural examination. Conclusions. The authors' results suggest that the early radiation-induced MBP changes between 1 and 3 months af ter single treatments of 10 and 30 Gy of radiation to the whole brain are indicative of permanent injury shown as de myelination of irradiated brain tissue.",Included

2424,"Clinical and radiographic outcome of treatment of thoracolumbar fractures without neurology. open vs percutaneous C-arm: Guided vs percutaneous 3d navigation: Guided pedicle screw fixation Introduction: Recently, as an alternative for the open pedicle screw fixation (OPSF) of thoraco-lumbar fractures (TLF), percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) has evolved to minimize soft tissue injury and perioperative morbidity. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of three different methods of neurologically intact TLF treatment: OPSF, minimally invasive two-plane conventional fluoroscopy-guided (FPPSF) and navigation-guided (N-PPSF). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 137 patients underwent either OPSF (n = 50) or F-PPSF (n = 39) or N-PPSF (n = 48) for stabilization of TLF between 2014 and 2016 in two Departments (Orthopaedics and Neurosurgery). Radiographs were obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up for assessment of the restoration of the spinal column. For radiologic parameters, Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body compression ratio were evaluated on lateral thoracolumbar radiographs. As a method of clinical evaluation, the intraoperative blood loss, operation time, radiation dose, postoperative hospital stay, the postoperative scar size and perioprative complications. Result(s): There were significant differences between open and both percutaneous methods of treatment in surgical blood loss and postoperative hospital stay in favour of percutaneous and without significant difference between F-PPSF and N-PPSF. The time of the surgery was the shortest in OPSF and F-PPSF. The radiation dose was both the highest for the patient and the lowest for the operative team in N-PPSF. The length of the postoperative scar was equal for all groups. There were five infections of the operative wound and one implant loosening in OPSF group without any significant complication. Postoperative VAS decreased significantly in all groups and there was a significant difference in favour of percutaneous techniques groups at the time of discharge and after 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. There were no statistical differences in VAS. For both F-PPSF and N-PPSF ODI was significantly better 6 weeks after the surgery than for OPSF without any difference between all groups at the final follow-up. The regional sagittal Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle and anterior height of the fractured vertebra all significantly improved in each group immediately after the surgery and at the final follow-up. Conclusion(s): Both percutaneous pedicle screw fixation techniques were comparable except the radiation dose for the operative team, which was the lowest in N-PPSF group. Although all three groups showed favorable outcomes at the final follow-up, F-PPSF and N-PPSF provided earlier pain relief, better functional improvement, less perioperative complications but worse early postoperative radiological outcome in comparison with OPSF.",Excluded

102,"Radiobiologic models for radiosurgery A series of initial radiobiologic investigations have been performed using three animal models. The baboon model proved to be a valuable technique to assess the in vivo radiobiologic response of single-fraction irradiation doses delivered to the primate brain stem. Multimodality neurodiagnostic testing, including CT, MR imaging, xenon-enhanced CT, evoked potential studies, and analysis of CSF myelin basic protein levels, all of which eventually were correlated with neuropathologic examination, enabled detection of lesions produced with high-dose (150 Gy) radiosurgery as early as 6 weeks. Within the first 6 months after radiosurgery, lower doses (20 Gy, 50 Gy) did not result in clinically or neurodiagnostically detectable lesions. The rat arteriovenous fistula model permits analysis of the delayed histopathologic effects of radiosurgery on an experimentally created fistula designed to mimic an AVM. The rat C6 glioma model is designed to evaluate the effect of radiosurgery in an infiltrative tumor that simulates a human malignant brain tumor. These studies are intended eventually to increase our knowledge about the safety and efficacy of radiosurgery in both the normal and tumor-implanted brains. We believe that such fundamental studies ultimately will improve our ability to reach the goals of radiosurgery: to destroy the target and spare the surrounding brain. Eventually, it may become feasible to achieve these goals by combining radiosurgical technique with both radiation sensitizers (for the treated volume) and brain protectors.

285,"Space-clamp problems when voltage clamping neurons expressing voltage-gated conductances The voltage-clamp technique is applicable only to spherical cells. In nonspherical cells, such as neurons, the membrane potential is not clamped distal to the voltage-clamp electrode. This means that the current recorded by the voltage-clamp electrode is the sum of the local current and of axial currents from locations experiencing different membrane potentials. Furthermore, voltage-gated currents recorded from a nonspherical cell are, by definition, severely distorted due to the lack of space clamp. Justifications for voltage clamping in nonspherical cells are, first, that the lack of space clamp is not severe in neurons with short dendrites. Second, passive cable theory may be invoked to justify application of voltage clamp to branching neurons, suggesting that the potential decay is sufficiently shallow to allow spatial clamping of the neuron. Here, using numerical simulations, we show that the distortions of voltage-gated K(+) and Ca(2+) currents are substantial even in neurons with short dendrites. The simulations also demonstrate that passive cable theory cannot be used to justify voltage clamping of neurons due to significant shunting to the reversal potential of the voltage-gated conductance during channel activation. Some of the predictions made by the simulations were verified using somatic and dendritic voltage-clamp experiments in rat somatosensory cortex. Our results demonstrate that voltage-gated K(+) and Ca(2+) currents recorded from branching neurons are almost always severely distorted.",Excluded
3129,"Non-coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for craniopharyngiomas reduces radiation doses to the bilateral hippocampus: a planning study comparing dynamic conformal arc therapy, coplanar VMAT, and non-coplanar VMAT BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that radiation-induced injuries to the hippocampus play important roles in compromising neurocognitive functioning for patients with brain tumors and it could be important to spare the hippocampus using modern planning methods for patients with craniopharyngiomas. As bilateral hippocampus are located on the same level as the planning target volume (PTV) in patients with craniopharyngioma, it seems possible to reduce doses to hippocampus using non-coplanar beams. While the use of non-coplanar beams in volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) of malignant intracranial tumors has recently been reported, no dosimetric comparison has yet been made between VMAT using non-coplanar arcs (ncVMAT) and VMAT employing only coplanar arcs (coVMAT) among patients with craniopharyngiomas. We performed a planning study comparing dose distributions to the PTV, hippocampus, and other organs at risk (OAR) of dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), coVMAT, and ncVMAT.METHODS: DCAT, coVMAT, and ncVMAT plans were created for 10 patients with craniopharyngiomas. The prescription dose was 52.2 Gy in 29 fractions, and 99 % of each PTV was covered by 90 % of the prescribed dose. The maximum dose was held below 107 % of the prescribed dose. CoVMAT and ncVMAT plans were formulated to satisfy the following criteria: the doses to the hippocampus were minimized, and the doses to the OAR were similar to or lower than those of DCAT.RESULTS: The mean equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractions to 40 % of the volumes of the bilateral hippocampus [EQD2(40%hippos)] were 15.4/10.8/6.5 Gy for DCAT/coVMAT/ncVMAT, respectively. The EQD2(40%hippos) for ncVMAT were <7.3 Gy, which is the threshold predicting cognitive impairment, as defined by Gondi et al.. The mean doses to normal brain tissue and the conformity indices were similar for the three plans, and the homogeneity indices were significantly better for coVMAT and ncVMAT compared with DCAT.CONCLUSIONS: NcVMAT is more appropriate than DCAT and coVMAT for patients with craniopharyngiomas. NcVMAT significantly reduces radiation doses to the bilateral hippocampus (to 50 % that of the DCAT) without increasing the doses to normal brain tissue and other OAR.",Excluded

1884,"Repeated cocaine administration increases voltage-sensitive calcium currents in response to membrane depolarization in medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a critical role in cocaine addiction. However, evidence to elucidate how the mPFC is functionally involved in cocaine addiction remains incomplete. Recent studies have revealed that repeated cocaine administration induces various neuroadaptations in pyramidal mPFC neurons, including a reduction in voltage-gated K+ currents (VGKCs) and a possible increase in voltage-sensitive Ca2+ currents (I(Ca)). Here, we performed both current-clamp recordings in brain slices and voltage-clamp recordings in freshly dissociated cells to determine whether I(Ca) is altered in mPFC pyramidal neurons after chronic cocaine treatment with a short-term or long-term withdrawal. In addition, a critical role of VGKCs in regulating the generation of Ca2+ plateau potential was also studied in mPFC neurons. Repeated cocaine administration significantly prolonged the duration of evoked Ca2+ plateau potentials and increased the whole-cell I(Ca) in mPFC neurons after a 3 d withdrawal. Selective blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels by nifedipine not only significantly increased the threshold but also reduced the duration and amplitude of Ca2+ plateau potentials in both saline- and cocaine-withdrawn mPFC neurons. However, there was no significant difference in the increased threshold, reduced duration, and decreased amplitude of Ca2+ potentials between saline- and cocaine-withdrawn neurons after blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels. Moreover, an increase in amplitude was also observed, whereas the prolonged duration persisted, in Ca2+ potentials after 2-3 weeks of withdrawal. These findings indicate that chronic exposure to cocaine facilitates the responsiveness of I(Ca), particularly via the activated L-type Ca2+ channels, to excitatory stimuli in rat mPFC pyramidal neurons.",Excluded

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil (TPF) chemotherapy was administered. The prescribed dose was 66-70.4 Gy to the GTV_P while maintaining all the critical neurologic organs within dose constraints.Results: The local response rate was 88.6% after induction chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the 3-year local failure-free survival (LFFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 92.4% and 89.6%, respectively. The average Dmin to the GTV_P was 59.4 Gy (range, 48.3-70.4 Gy). Additionally, 54.0 Gy was identified as the optimal cut-off Dmin to the GTV_P, and the Dmin >=54.0 Gy group had a better local complete response rate after IMRT (52.4% vs. 81.3%, chi2 = 7.335, P = 0.007), a better 3-year LFFS (95.9% vs. 78.4%, P = 0.005) and a better OS (93.3% vs. 75.9%, P = 0.003). Furthermore, a multivariate analysis found the Dmin to the GTV_P >=54.0 Gy to be prognostically important for LFFS and OS. One patient (1%) developed asymptomatic temporal lobe necrosis, but no other neurological dysfunctions were observed.Conclusions: For T3-4-stage NPC treated with IMRT plus TPF chemotherapy, excellent local control with few late toxicities was achieved. A Dmin >=54.0 Gy to the GTV_P may confer better local control. New ways to increase the Dmin to the GTV_P as far as possible without increasing late toxicities are urgently required.",Excluded

In this study, we investigated the effects of IR on the differentiation of Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells and the involvement of tumor protein 53 (p53) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) during this process.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells were exposed to (137)Cs gamma-rays at 4, 8 or 16 Gy. After incubation for 72 h with or without inhibitors of p53, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and other kinases, the neuronal differentiation of irradiated Neuro-2a cells was examined through analyzing neurite outgrowth and neuronal maker expression and the activation of related signaling proteins by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Mouse primary neural stem cells (NSC) were exposed to IR at 1 Gy. The change of neuronal marker was examined using immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: The irradiation of Neuro-2a cells significantly increased the neurite outgrowth and the expression of neuronal markers (neuronal nuclei [NeuN], microtubule-associated protein 2 [Map2], growth associated protein-43 [GAP-43], and Ras-related protein 13 [Rab13]). Immunocytochemistry revealed that neuronal class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1) positive cells were increased and nestin positive cells were decreased by IR in Neuro-2a cells, which supported the IR-induced neuronal differentiation. However, the IR-induced neuronal differentiation was significantly attenuated when p53 was inhibited by pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) or p53-small interfering RNA (siRNA). The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, also suppressed the IR-induced neurite outgrowth, the activation of p53, the expression of GAP-43 and Rab13, and the increase of Tuj-1 positive cells. The increase of neurite outgrowth and Tuj-1 positive cells by IR and its suppression by LY294002 were also observed in mouse primary NSC.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IR is able to trigger the neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells and the activation of p53 via PI3K is an important step for the IR-induced differentiation of Neuro-2a cells.",Included

3090,"A ciliary opsin in the brain of a marine annelid zooplankton is ultraviolet-sensitive, and the sensitivity is tuned by a single amino acid residue Ciliary opsins were classically thought to function only in vertebrates for vision, but they have also been identified recently in invertebrates for non-visual photoreception. Larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii are used as a zooplankton model, and this zooplankton species possesses a ""vertebrate-type"" ciliary opsin (named c-opsin) in the brain. Platynereis c-opsin is suggested to relay light signals for melatonin production and circadian behaviors. Thus, the spectral and biochemical characteristics of this c-opsin would be directly related to non-visual photoreception in this zooplankton model. Here we demonstrate that the c-opsin can sense UV to activate intracellular signaling cascades and that it can directly bind exogenous all-trans-retinal. These results suggest that this c-opsin regulates circadian signaling in a UV-dependent manner and that it does not require a supply of 11-cis-retinal for photoreception. Avoidance of damaging UV irradiation is a major cause of large-scale daily zooplankton movement, and the observed capability of the c-opsin to transmit UV signals and bind all-trans-retinal is ideally suited for sensing UV radiation in the brain, which presumably lacks enzymes producing 11-cis-retinal. Mutagenesis analyses indicated that a unique amino acid residue (Lys-94) is responsible for c-opsin-mediated UV sensing in the Platynereis brain. We therefore propose that acquisition of the lysine residue in the c-opsin would be a critical event in the evolution of Platynereis to enable detection of ambient UV light. In summary, our findings indicate that the c-opsin possesses spectral and biochemical properties suitable for UV sensing by the zooplankton model.",Excluded

3024,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitors protect hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis by regulating MDM2-p53 pathway Exposure of the brain to ionizing radiation can cause neurocognitive deficiencies. The pathophysiology of these neurological changes is complex and includes radiation-induced apoptosis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. We have recently found that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) resulted in significant protection from radiation-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. The molecular mechanisms of this cytoprotection include abrogation of radiation-induced accumulation of p53. Here we show that pretreatment of irradiated HT-22 hippocampal-derived neurons with small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3beta SB216763 or SB415286, or with GSK-3beta-specific shRNA resulted in accumulation of the p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Knockdown of MDM2 using specific shRNA or chemical inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction prevented the protective changes triggered by GSK-3beta inhibition in irradiated HT-22 neurons and restored radiation cytotoxicity. We found that this could be due to regulation of apoptosis by subcellular localization and interaction of GSK-3beta, p53 and MDM2. These data suggest that the mechanisms of radioprotection by GSK-3beta inhibitors in hippocampal neurons involve regulation of MDM2-dependent p53 accumulation and interactions between GSK-3beta, MDM2 and p53.",Included
3556,"The inhibitory effect of minocycline on radiation-induced neuronal apoptosis via AMPKalpha1 signaling-mediated autophagy Due to an increasing concern about radiation-induced cognitive deficits for brain tumor patients receiving radiation therapy, developing and evaluating countermeasures has become inevitable. Our previous study has found that minocycline, a clinical available antibiotics that can easily cross the blood brain barrier, mitigates radiation-induced long-term memory loss in rats, accompanied by decreased hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Thus, in the present study, we report an unknown mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of minocycline. We demonstrated that minocycline prevented primary neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis and promoted radiation-induced autophagy in vitro. Moreover, using an immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line, HT22 cells, we found that the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated HT22 cells was not related to DNA damage repair since minocycline did not facilitate DNA DSB repair in irradiated HT22 cells. Further investigation showed that minocycline significantly enhanced X-irradiation-induced AMPKalpha1 activation and autophagy, thus resulting in decreased apoptosis. Additionally, although the antioxidant potential of minocycline might contribute to its apoptosis-inhibitory effect, it was not involved in its enhancive effect on radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy. Taken together, we have revealed a novel mechanism for the protective effect of minocycline on irradiated neurons, e.g. minocycline protects neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis via enhancing radiation-induced AMPKalpha1-mediated autophagy.",Included
272,"New and safe experimental model of radiation-induced neurovascular histological changes for microsurgical research The aim is to create a new and safe experimental model of radiation-induced neurovascular histological changes with reduced morbidity and mortality for use with experimental microsurgical techniques. Seventy-two Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were divided as follows: Group I: control group, 24 rats clinically evaluated during six weeks; Group II: evaluation of acute side-effects (two-week follow-up period), 24 irradiated (20 Gy) rats; and Group III: evaluation of subacute side-effects (six-week follow-up period), 24 irradiated (20 Gy) rats. Variables included clinical assessments, weight, vascular permeability (arterial and venous), mortality and histological studies. No significant differences were observed between groups with respect to the variables studied. Significant differences were observed between groups I vs II-III regarding survival rates and histological changes to arteries, veins and nerves. Rat body weights showed progressive increases in all groups, and the mortality rate of the present model is 10.4% compared with 30-40% in the previous models. In conclusion, the designed model induces selective changes by radiotherapy in the neurovascular bundle without histological changes affecting the surrounding tissues. This model allows therapeutic experimental studies to be conducted, including the viability of microvascular and microneural sutures post radiotherapy in the cervical neurovascular bundle.",Included

Cells exposed to a priming dose of X-rays and then exposed immediately to a series of neutron doses regard the X-ray dose as equivalent to a neutron dose giving the same surviving fraction (iso-effective). If the cells are exposed to a neutron dose followed by X-rays the resulting survival is higher than would be obtained if the primary dose had been an iso-effective X-ray dose. However, it is lower than would be expected if the two radiations acted independently. The results imply that there is interaction between the damage caused by X-rays and fast neurons.

3053,"Olfactory testing in staff working in the cardiac catheterization laboratory Background: In the absence of specific protection, invasive cardiologists receive a high lifetime head exposure, with organ doses in the 1 to 3 Sievert range (equivalent to the risk of 50,000 to 150,000 chest x-rays). Radiation exposure in this dose range can reduce neurogenesis in adult brain and negatively impact on olfactory function, whose impairment is a recognized early biomarker of neurode-generative disease. Aim(s): To assess psychological testing results in exposed subjects (ES) working as staff in the Cath Lab compared with non-exposed matched controls (NES). Method(s): A complete olfactory test battery (Sniffin' Sticks Extended test) was performed in 130 Cath Lab ES (60 males; age=44.9+/-8.7 years; 58 interventional cardiologists, 60 nurses, 12 technicians). A control group of age- and gendermatched non-exposed subjects (NES) was also studied. Result(s): ES showed lower scores in the Odor Threshold test (p=.006), Discrimination test (p=.039), Identification test (p=.005) and TDI (the sum of the previous 3 tests, p<.001), as reported in Figure. Subnormal scores of at least 1 of 3 odor subtests were present in 18/130 ES and 7/130 NES (13.8 vs 5.4%, p<.001). Significant correlations were found between Identification Score and years at Cath Lab (r=-.18, p=.012), this last parameter being also correlated with the overall TDI Score (r=-.16, p=.048). (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): In ES, olfactory testing showed mild impairment of identification (cortical), discrimination (bulb) and threshold (peripheral) function, somewhat correlated with radiation exposure in the Cath Lab. While further evidence is needed at this point, in the meantime head protection should be a mandatory good practice of safety in every Cath Lab.",Included
1089,"A Comparison of Ramipril and Bevacizumab to Mitigate Radiation-Induced Brain Necrosis: An Experimental Study BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, is a new treatment approach for radionecrosis. In our study, we compared the prophylactic and therapeutic usage of a promising agent, ramipril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), with that of bevacizumab for reducing radiation-induced brain injury after high-dose stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS: A total of 60 Wistar rats were used. The rats were irradiated with a single dose of 50 Gy using a Leksell Gamma Knife device. Bevacizumab and ramipril were administered in the prophylactic protocol (starting the first day of SRS) and in the therapeutic protocol (starting the fourth week of SRS). Their usage was continued until 12 weeks, and the right frontal lobes of the rats were examined histologically (hematoxylin and eosin stain) and immunohistochemically (hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF]-1alpha, VEGF, and CD31 antibody expression).RESULTS: The expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and CD31 had significantly increased at 12 weeks after SRS compared with the control group. The addition of bevacizumab or ramipril to SRS significantly mitigated the histological severity of radiation injury and the expression of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, and CD31. However, the prophylactic use of bevacizumab and ramipril seemed to be more effective than therapeutic administration. Our results also revealed that the greatest benefit was achieved with the use of prophylactic administration of bevacizumab compared with other treatment protocols.CONCLUSIONS: Ramipril might be a promising agent for patients with radionecrosis. Clinical studies are required to investigate the effective and safe doses of ramipril, which is an inexpensive, well-tolerated drug that can cross the blood-brain barrier.",Excluded
2289,"Multiple cone pathways are involved in photic regulation of retinal dopamine Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the retina and plays a central role in the light adaptive processes of the visual system. The sole source of retinal dopamine is dopaminergic amacrine cells (DACs). We and others have previously demonstrated that DACs are activated by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) upon illumination. However, it is still not clear how each class of photosensitive cells generates light responses in DACs. We genetically isolated cone function in mice to specifically examine the cone-mediated responses of DACs and their neural pathways. In addition to the reported excitatory input to DACs from light-increment (ON) bipolar cells, we found that cones alternatively signal to DACs via a retrograde signalling pathway from ipRGCs. Cones also produce ON and light-decrement (OFF) inhibitory responses in DACs, which are mediated by other amacrine cells, likely driven by type 1 and type 2/3a OFF bipolar cells, respectively. Dye injections indicated that DACs had similar morphological profiles with or without ON/OFF inhibition. Our data demonstrate that cones utilize specific parallel excitatory and inhibitory circuits to modulate DAC activity and efficiently regulate dopamine release and the light-adaptive state of the retina.",Excluded
1863,"Endovascular treatment using low-power ultraviolet laser for delayed vasospasm in the rabbit carotid artery model BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We previously reported that pretreatment with external ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at 325 nm before blood exposure prevented the development of chronic vasospasm in rabbit common carotid arteries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the preventive effect of endovascular UV light on vasospasm after blood immersion by using the same animal model.METHODS: The right common carotid arteries in 63 rabbits were enclosed in silicon cuffs on day 0. Sheaths were empty or filled with clotted blood. Thirty minutes after the placement of the sheaths, either alone or with blood, the common carotid arteries were subjected to UV or visible light (442 nm) irradiation via an endovascular approach at a fluence rate of 0.17 W/cm(2). The animals were killed on day 2, 9, or 30. Digital subtraction angiography was performed on days 0 and 2 and at the end point to evaluate the degree of vasospasm.RESULTS: UV treatment significantly prevented the development of vasospasm on day 2. On days 9 and 30, there were no significant differences between UV-treated animals and control animals. The preventive effect reached an approximate plateau with an irradiation time of 10 s. No severe vascular injury, such as perforation, occurred in response to UV treatment during the observation period. UV light was significantly more effective than visible light in preventing vasospasm (P <.001).CONCLUSION: These results suggest that endovascular UV irradiation after blood exposure has a prophylactic effect on vasospasm and suggest a dependence on irradiation wavelength and duration of irradiation.",Excluded
2334,"Mechanisms of disease: DNA repair defects and neurological disease In this Review, familial and sporadic neurological disorders reported to have an etiological link with DNA repair defects are discussed, with special emphasis placed on the molecular link between the disease phenotype and the precise DNA repair defect. Of the 15 neurological disorders listed, some of which have symptoms of progeria, six - spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - seem to result from increased oxidative stress, and the inability of the base excision repair pathway to handle the damage to DNA that this induces. Five of the conditions (xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, Down syndrome, and triple-A syndrome) display a defect in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, four (Huntington's disease, various spinocerebellar ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia and myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2) exhibit an unusual expansion of repeat sequences in DNA, and four (ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Alzheimer's disease) exhibit defects in genes involved in repairing double-strand breaks. The current overall picture indicates that oxidative stress is a major causative factor in genomic instability in the brain, and that the nature of the resulting neurological phenotype depends on the pathway through which the instability is normally repaired.",Excluded
1254,"Unmyelinated visceral afferents exhibit frequency dependent action potential broadening while myelinated visceral afferents do not Sensory information arising from visceral organ systems is encoded into action potential trains that propagate along afferent fibers to target nuclei in the central nervous system. These information streams range from tight patterns of action potentials that are well synchronized with the sensory transduction event to irregular, patternless discharge with no clear correlation to the sensory input. In general terms these afferent pathways can be divided into unmyelinated and myelinated fiber types. Our laboratory has a long standing interest in the functional differences between these two types of afferents in terms of the preprocessing of sensory information into action potential trains (synchrony, frequency, duration, etc.), the reflexogenic consequences of this sensory input to the central nervous system and the ionic channels that give rise to the electrophysiological properties of these unique cell types. The aim of this study was to determine whether there were any functional differences in the somatic action potential characteristics of unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents in response to different rates of sensory nerve stimulation. Our results showed that activity and frequency-dependent widening of the somatic action potential was quite prominent in unmyelinated but not myelinated vagal afferents. Spike broadening often leads to increased influx of Ca(2+) ions that has been associated with a diverse range of modulatory mechanisms both at the cell body and central synaptic terminations (e.g. increased neurotransmitter release.) We conclude that our observations are indicative of fundamentally different mechanisms for neural integration of sensory information arising from unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents.",Excluded

We have retrospectively analyzed 24 patients treated with IMRT. Five were selected within each of the following regions: head and neck, thoracic, abdomen, and prostate. Four patients were optimized within the brain region. The clinically treated plans were re-optimized using Philips Pinnacle3 v. 8 with the direct machine parameter optimization algorithm. The number of segments per beam from the treated plan was systematically reduced by 80%, 60%, 40%, and 30%, and the following statistics have been analyzed for plan quality: target min, mean, and max doses; critical structure doses; and integral dose. We have attempted to define the smallest number of segments per beam for IMRT treatment plans. Results indicate that IMRT plans can be delivered with acceptable quality with approximately 3-6 segments per beam for the anatomical regions analyzed. A reduction in the number of segments decreases treatment delivery time, reduces machine wear and tear, and minimizes the amount of time the patient is on the treatment table, which in turn reduces the chances of intrafractional uncertainties.",Excluded

Methods: A total of 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups to test the radioprotective effectiveness of thymoquinone and caffeic acid phenethyl ester administered by intraperitoneal injection. Appropriate control groups were also studied. Results: While liver tissue total oxidant status, lipid hydroperoxide level, and oxidative stress index were significantly increased in the irradiated (IR) group, compared with other groups, total antioxidant status, sulfhydryl levels, and paraoxonase (PON) activity were significantly decreased. Ceruloplasmin activity in IR plus TQ and IR groups was higher than the control group. Arylesterase and PON activities in IR plus TQ- and IR plus CAPE-supplemented groups were lower than those of control groups. Conclusions: TQ and CAPE decrease oxidative stress markers and have antioxidant effects, which also augment antioxidant capacity in the liver tissue of irradiated rats.

Sixteen men were randomly assigned to no exercise (NOE, N = 8) or REX (N = 8). REX performed 5 sets x 6-10 repetitions to failure of constant resistance concentric/eccentric plantar flexion every other day during BRU. One-repetition maximum (1RM) strength was tested on the training device. The angle-specific torque-velocity relationship across 5 velocities (0, 0.52, 1.05, 1.75, and 2.97 rad.s-1) and the full range-of-motion power-velocity relationship were assessed on a dynamometer. Torque-position analyses identified strength changes at shortened, neutral, and stretched muscle lengths. Concentric and eccentric contractile work were measured across ten repetitions at 1.05 rad.s-1. Maximal neural activation was measured by surface electromyography (EMG). 1RM decreased 9% in NOE and improved 11% in REX (P < 0.05). Concentric (0.52 and 1.05 rad.s-1), eccentric (0.52 and 2.97 rad.s-1), and isometric angle-specific torques decreased (P < 0.05) in NOE, averaging 18%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. Power dropped (P < 0.05) in NOE at three eccentric (21%) and two concentric (14%) velocities. REX protected angle-specific torque and average power at all velocities. Concentric and eccentric strength decreased at stretched (16%) and neutral (17%) muscle lengths (P < 0.05) in NOE while REX maintained or improved strength at all joint positions. Concentric (15%) and eccentric (11%) contractile work fell in NOE (P < 0.05) but not in REX. Maximal plantar flexor EMG did not change in either group. In summary, constant resistance concentric/eccentric REX completely prevented plantar flexor performance deconditioning induced by BRU. The reported benefits of REX should prove useful in prescribing exercise for astronauts in microgravity and for patients susceptible to functional decline during bed- or chair-bound hospital stays.",Excluded

2547,"Fractionated ionizing radiation accelerates loss of amplified MDR1 genes harbored by extrachromosomal DNA in tumor cells In tumor specimens such as those from neuroblastoma, ovarian, and lung carcinoma patients, the prevalence of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules harboring amplified genes has been well established. In some cases, the amplified genes have been identified as oncogenes, and their increased expression appears to contribute to the maintenance and progression of the malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fractionated radiation treatment, given in daily doses similar to those administered clinically, on the stability of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules in cancer cells. Our studies were conducted with multidrug-resistant KB cells, which harbor extrachromosomal copies of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) almost exclusively on circular DNA molecules of approximately 750 and 1500 kb pairs. This size range is representative of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules that have been shown to harbor amplified oncogenes in vivo. Exponentially growing MDR KB cells were exposed to 1400 and 2800 cGy ionizing radiation administered in 7 and 14 fractions, respectively, at 200 cGy per fraction/day. A statistically significant decrease in MDR1 extrachromosomal gene copy number was reproducibly detected in the irradiated cells compared with unirradiated cells passaged for the duration of the experiment in the absence of radiation treatment. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction in multidrug resistance and in P-glycoprotein levels, as determined by clonogenic dose-response assays and Western analyses, respectively. P-glycoprotein is a multidrug transporter encoded by the MDR1 gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies further determined that extrachromosomal circular DNA loss correlated to the entrapment of these DNA molecules in radiation-induced micronuclei. These results indicate that radiation-induced loss of extrachromosomally amplified genes from tumor cells via their entrapment in micronuclei contributes to the improved therapeutic response observed for some cancers.",Excluded

Our aim was to evaluate the performance of lower-dose head CT for detection of intracranial findings resulting in acute neurologic deficit.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Projection data from 83 patients undergoing unenhanced spiral head CT for suspected neurologic deficits were collected. Cases positive for infarction, intra-axial hemorrhage, mass, or extra-axial hemorrhage required confirmation by histopathology, surgery, progression of findings, or corresponding neurologic deficit; cases negative for these target diagnoses required negative assessments by two neuroradiologists and a clinical neurologist. A routine dose head CT was obtained using 250 effective mAs and iterative reconstruction. Lower-dose configurations were reconstructed (25-effective mAs iterative reconstruction, 50-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 100-effective mAs filtered back-projection and iterative reconstruction, 200-effective mAs filtered back-projection). Three neuroradiologists circled findings, indicating diagnosis, confidence (0-100), and image quality. The difference between the jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit at routine and lower-dose configurations was estimated. A lower 95% CI estimate of the difference greater than -0.10 indicated noninferiority.RESULTS: Forty-two of 83 patients had 70 intracranial findings (29 infarcts, 25 masses, 10 extra- and 6 intra-axial hemorrhages) at routine head CT (CT dose index = 38.3 mGy). The routine-dose jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81-0.93).

1992,"ATP consumption by mammalian rod photoreceptors in darkness and in light Why do vertebrates use rods and cones that hyperpolarize, when in insect eyes a single depolarizing photoreceptor can function at all light levels? We answer this question at least in part with a comprehensive assessment of ATP consumption for mammalian rods from voltages and currents and recently published physiological and biochemical data. In darkness, rods consume 10(8) ATP s(-1), about the same as Drosophila photoreceptors. Ion fluxes associated with phototransduction and synaptic transmission dominate; as in CNS, the contribution of enzymes of the second-messenger cascade is surprisingly small. Suppression of rod responses in daylight closes light-gated channels and reduces total energy consumption by >75%, but in Drosophila light opens channels and increases consumption 5-fold. Rods therefore provide an energy-efficient mechanism not present in rhabdomeric photoreceptors. Rods are metabolically less ""costly"" than cones, because cones do not saturate in bright light and use more ATP s(-1) for transducin activation and rhodopsin phosphorylation. This helps to explain why the vertebrate retina is duplex, and why some diurnal animals like primates have a small number of cones, concentrated in a region of high acuity.",Excluded

81,"Interstitial irradiation of brain metastases Randomized studies have shown that survival in patients with single brain metastases is significantly higher after the combined treatment of surgical removal and whole-brain irradiation than after whole-brain radiation therapy alone. In patients with deep-seated lesions or those located in critical sites of the brain, as well as in cases in which the patient's general condition makes general anaesthesia difficult or impossible microsurgical resection usually cannot be performed or only with an increased surgical risk. Stereotactic radiosurgery, which can be done by means of convergent beam irradiation or by the implantation of highly loaded 125I seeds, provides an alternative to open procedures. In the following we report on our results using a stereotactic radiosurgical technique. A series of 20 treatments is presented, in which biopsy was performed and 125I seeds were implanted, both under stereotactic conditions in the same session. The 125I seeds were sealed in a teflon catheter, were left indwelling temporarily, and then removed after application of the prescribed radiation dose (6,000cGy at the tumour margin). There was only one recurrence in our series, complications occurred in only one patient by temporary aggravation of a pre-existing hemiparesis.

So far computed tomography (CT) has been the first choice for detection of reasons for recurrent hearing loss. CT has the disadvantage of metal-induced artefacts after insertion of middle ear implants and of a relatively high irradiation dose.METHODS: Flat panel CT (fpCT) was performed in three temporal bone specimen after experimental insertion of different stapes prostheses, aiming to validate the accuracy of fpCT of the middle and inner ear. Additionally, 28 consecutive patients, supplied with different stapes prostheses underwent post-operative fpCT to compare the pre- and post-operative hearing results with the determined prosthesis position in the middle and inner ear.RESULTS: In all cases, fpCT showed a statistically significant correlation between hearing improvement and prosthesis position. This technique provided detailed post-operative information of the implant position in patients and temporal bone specimen.CONCLUSIONS: The new imaging technique of fpCT allows the immediate and almost artefact-free evaluation of surgical results following stapesplasty.

2947,"Extracranial carotid stenosis after radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a Malaysian study Background and objectives: Radiation treatment in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known to be associated with increased prevalence of carotid stenosis. The objectives of the study was to determine the prevalence of radiation-induced extracranial carotid stenosis, plaque, carotid intima thickness (CIMT) in NPC patients; to explore whether the stenosis is due to direct effect of radiation rather than general tendency to atherosclerosis. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the University Malaya Medical Centre from July 2011 to February 2012. The study subjects consisted of 47 NPC patients who were treated with radiation, and 47 healthy control. The patients and control had carotid duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler (TCD). Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, the time lapse from radiation was 76.7 +/- 95.3 months. Internal carotid artery (ICA) and common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis of >=50% was seen in 17.0% of patients vs 2.1 % of controls (p = 0.031), with 61.7% of patients and 19.1% of controls having plaque in ICA and CCA (p=0.004). CIMT was increased in 70.2% of patients and 44.7% of controls (p =0.022). Both the patient group and control had similar rate of intracranial stenosis of 12.8% in TCD. Conclusion(s): Extracranial internal carotid artery is the most common site of stenosis following radiotherapy in NPC. This suggests that local trauma from irradiation is the most important factor in predisposition to atherosclerosis following radiation therapy.",Included

648,"Characterization of structurally distinct, isoform-selective phosphoinositide 3'-kinase inhibitors in combination with radiation in the treatment of glioblastoma The phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling pathway plays a key role in fundamental cellular functions important in normal cellular homeostasis and malignant transformation. Deregulated signaling through this pathway contributes to development of gliomas and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway has thus emerged as a promising approach to successful treatment of gliomas. We assessed the radiosensitizing potential of four small-molecule inhibitors that differ in their activities against specific isoforms of the PI3K 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). p110alpha inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of both protein kinase B/Akt and S6 in all cell lines examined, effectively decreased cellular proliferation, and produced additive cytotoxic effects in combination with radiation therapy. The p110beta inhibitor exhibited limited biochemical effects and failed to decrease cellular proliferation or viability as either a single agent or in combination with radiation or rapamycin. In vivo studies examining the effects of the p110alpha inhibitor in combination with radiation indicated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate induced by the combined treatment compared with each treatment modality alone. This translated into a trend toward prolonged time-to-failure for mice in the combination treatment group. In conclusion, PI3K inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of glioblastomas, especially when used in combination with ionizing radiation.",Excluded
2111,"Long-Term Deficits in Behavior Performances Caused by Low- and High-Linear Energy Transfer Radiation Efforts to protect astronauts from harmful galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) require a better understanding of the effects of GCR on human health. In particular, little is known about the lasting effects of GCR on the central nervous system (CNS), which may lead to behavior performance deficits. Previous studies have shown that high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in rodents leads to short-term declines in a variety of behavior tests. However, the lasting impact of low-, medium- and high-LET radiation on behavior are not fully defined. Therefore, in this study C57BL/6 male mice were irradiated with 100 or 250 cGy of gamma rays (LET ~0.3 KeV/mum), 10 or 100 cGy of <sup>1</sup>H at 1,000 MeV/n (LET ~0.2 KeV/mum), <sup>28</sup>Si at 300 MeV/n (LET ~69 KeV/mum) or <sup>56</sup>Fe at 600 MeV/n (LET of ~180 KeV/mum), and behavior metrics were collected at 5 and 9 months postirradiation to analyze differences among radiation qualities and doses. A significant dose effect was observed on recognition memory and activity levels measured 9 months postirradiation, regardless of radiation source. In contrast, we observed that each ion species had a distinct effect on anxiety, motor coordination and spatial memory at extended time points. Although <sup>28</sup>Si and <sup>56</sup>Fe are both regarded as high-LET particles, they were shown to have different detrimental effects on behavior. In summary, our findings suggest that GCR not only affects the CNS in the short term, but also has lasting damaging effects on the CNS that can cause sustained declines in behavior performance.",Included

However, little is known about the long-term effects of combined microgravity and low-dose radiation. We exposed mice to gamma radiation using a cobalt-57 plate (0.01 cGy/h for a total dose of 0.04 Gy), hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, or a combination of both for 3 weeks. Mice then underwent a behavioral test battery after 1 week, 1 month, 4 months, and 8 months to assess sensorimotor coordination/balance (rotarod), activity levels (open field), learned helplessness/depression-like behavior (tail suspension test), risk-taking (elevated zero maze), and spatial learning/memory (water maze). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression was assessed in the brain after behavioral testing to determine blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Mice that received unloading spent significantly more time in the exposed portions of the elevated zero maze, were hypoactive in the open field, and spent less time struggling on the tail suspension test than mice that did not receive unloading. Mice in the combination group expressed more AQP4 immunoactivity than controls. Elevated zero maze and AQP4 data were correlated. No differences were seen on the water maze or rotarod, and no radiation-only effects were observed. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to BBB dysfunction.",Included

Here we review the technical foundations of fMRI. We begin with a brief summary of the basic physical principles of magnetization and nuclear magnetic resonance. This is followed by a description of some commonly used procedures for magnetic resonance imaging in general; an introduction to exogenous and endogenous contrast agents; and a section on gradient echo echoplanar imaging for fMRI specifically.

Pain radiation may be forward or backward. We aimed to analyse a large series of patients attended in an outpatient headache clinic. Method(s): We systematically included all patients fulfilling criteria from March 2008 to January 2019. We prospectively assessed clinical and demographic characteristics, therapeutic requirements and response. Result(s): We included 87 patients (61 females, 26 males) out of 5980 attended during study period (1.45%). Age at onset was 45.3+/-16.8 years (16-84). 56 cases (64.4%) suffered a forward EF, 28 (32.2%) a backward EF, and in 3 (3.4%) paroxysms described both trajectories. Pain was strictly unilateral in 72 (82.7%) patients whilst in 11 (12.6%) shifted both sides and in 4 (4.6%) presented a sagittal trajectory. Pain quality was mainly described as electric (52, 59.7%), or stabbing (27. 31%) and intensity rated as 6.9+/-1.9 (3-10). In 28 cases (32%) autonomic features appeared (mainly lacrimation). Temporal pattern was heterogeneous, with spontaneous remissions in 27 cases (31%). 54 patients (62.1%) required a preventive therapy. The drugs that presented a better response were Gabapentin and Lamotrigin. 5 refractory cases were successfully managed with Lamotrigin.

2778,"Radiosensitivity and differentiation of ganglion cells within fetal mouse retinal explants in vitro Fetal mouse retinas were explanted at 13-14 days of gestation, and exposed to gamma radiation in vitro. Not all regions of the retina were equally susceptible to radiation-induced necrosis; when exposed to 5000 rads soon after explanation, each explant had a single small radioresistant nubbin of apparently intact tissue, located near the optic nerve-head. This region of radioresistant tissue was larger when the dose of radiation was reduced and when the explants were exposed at later times in vitro, indicating the existence of a gradient of radioresistance across retinal explants which spread outward through at least the first week in vitro, the period examined. Based upon the extensive in situ literature which has correlated the emergence of radioresistance with the differentiation of retinal neurons, we conclude that the in situ central-to-peripheral sequence of cellular differentiation continues in vitro within our retinal explants. Whereas the ganglion cell axonal outgrowth from control retinas grown in isolation on collagen substrates underwent a gradual disintegration over 3 weeks in vitro, the sparse axonal outgrowth from explants exposed to 5000 rads disintegrated abruptly at 5-7 days in vitro. This did not appear to be due to direct damage from radiation, but instead reflected the fact that axons in irradiated cultures arose from central retinal regions only, while many axons in control cultures emerged from later-differentiating peripheral regions. We suggest that disintegration of individual axons in the outgrowth may occur rapidly and in a central-to-peripheral sequence. These findings should be useful in designing assays for trophic factors which may prevent ganglion cell axon disintegration in this in vitro model system.",Excluded
3354,"Ribonuclear foci at the neuromuscular junction in myotonic dystrophy type 1 In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) the muscle fibers express RNA containing an expanded CUG repeat (CUG(exp)).

Splicing factors in the muscleblind (MBNL) family are sequestered in ribonuclear foci, resulting in abnormal regulation of alternative splicing. In extrajunctional nuclei, these effects on splicing regulation lead to reduced chloride conductance and altered insulin receptor signaling. Here we show that CUG(exp) RNA is also expressed in subsynaptic nuclei of muscle fibers and in motor neurons in DM1, causing sequestration of MBNL1 protein in both locations. In a transgenic mouse model, expression of CUG(exp) RNA at high levels in extrajunctional nuclei replicates many features of DM1, but the toxic RNA is poorly expressed in subsynaptic nuclei and the mice fail to develop denervation-like features of DM1 myopathology. Our findings indicate that subsynaptic nuclei and motor neurons are at risk for DM1-induced spliceopathy, which may affect function or stability of the neuromuscular junction.",Excluded

To compare various fractionation schedules, the biologically effective dose (BED) was applied. SBRT dose was calculated with linear-quadratic model and normalized to a 2-Gy equivalent dose (nBED, alpha/beta =2 Gy for spinal cord, alpha/beta =10 Gy for tumor). Doses to a point within the spinal cord that received the maximum dose (Pmax) were checked. Local control failure was defined as progression by imaging study. Overall survival, progression free survival, delivered radiation dose to tumor and spinal cord, and spinal cord Pmax nBED were compared in two groups.RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation doses to tumor margin during SBRT were 51.1 Gy2/10 (retreatment) and 50.7 Gy2/10 (initial treatment). Mean survival was 29.6 months (overall)/20.7 months (retreatment)/ 32.4 months (initial treatment). Mean progression free period was 23.9 months (overall)/18.0 months (retreatment)/ 26.0 months (initial treatment). Radiological control rates of retreatment and initial treatment group were 96%/95% at six months, 81%/89% at 12 months and 79%/90% at 24 months. Among 54 retreatment lesions, 13 lesions showed local control failure during follow-up. With regard to spinal cord radiation dose during SBRT, Spinal cord Pmax nBED was 46.2 Gy2/2 (retreatment) and 48.7 Gy2/2 (initial treatment). In retreatment group, total nBED to spinal cord was a mean of 83.4 Gy2/2.

One was for a sacral defect after resection of a recurrent fibrosarcoma. All the flaps obtained satisfactory results. Clinical applications revealed that the blood supply of the lateral abdominal skin was mainly from the lateral cutaneous branches of the 9th, 10th and 11th intercostal arteries, among which there were numerous anastomoses. The lateral abdominal island flap can be pedicled with any of these lateral cutaneous branches. The long pedicle of the flap provides a wide range of trnasposition from the axilla to the sacrum. As the pedicle of the flap contains the lateral cutaneous branch of the intercostal nerve, the flap can bring sensation function to the recipient area.

Following leukapheresis and in preparation for CART infusion, contemporary bridging and lymphodepletion regimens rely mostly on cytotoxic chemotherapy. Here, in a cohort of patients treated with commercial tisa-cel and axi-cel, we show that bridging-RT may offer a supplemental approach. Methods and Materials: Thirty-one patients receiving commercial tisa-cel (n = 13) or axi-cel (n = 18) between August 2018 and February 2019 for r/rABL were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: (1) bridging-RT within 30 days of CART infusion or (2) nonbridging-RT (NBRT), in which patients received either remote RT greater than 30 days before CART infusion or no prior RT. Result(s): Five patients received bridging-RT within 30 days of CART infusion. Median bridging-RT dose was 37.5 Gy and was completed a median of 13 days before infusion. No grade 3 (G3) or higher RT-toxicities occurred. No patients in the bridging-RT group experienced G3 or higher CART-related toxicities (CRS or neurotoxicity), and 23% (n = 6) and 15% (n = 4) experienced G3-5 CRS and G3-5 neurotoxicity in the NBRT group, respectively. Overall treatment response in the bridging-RT and NBRT groups was 80% and 64%, respectively. The axi-cel CART product was associated with CRS (odds ratio [OR] = 26.67, P =.001) and CRS correlated with neurotoxicity (OR = 12.22, P =.028). There was a trend toward an association for CRS with metabolic tumor volume (OR = 1.06/mL, P =.141) and TLG (OR = 1.01/mL x standard uptake value, P =.099). Conclusion(s): Bridging-RT before commercial CART does not appear to increase the risk for CART-related toxicities or negatively affect outcomes in r/rABL patients. No G3 or higher RT-toxicities occurred in this series. Pretreatment metabolic tumor burden may be associated with CART-associated CRS; however, larger patient numbers are required to elucidate significant associations.

2952,"Expression of Ndrg2 in the rat frontal cortex after antidepressant and electroconvulsive treatment Although the therapeutic action of antidepressants most likely involves the regulation of serotonergic and noradrenergic signal transduction, no consensus has been reached concerning their precise molecular or cellular mechanisms of action. In the present study, we demonstrated that chronic treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant (imipramine) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (sertraline) reduced the expression of Ndrg2 mRNA and protein in the rat frontal cortex. Ndrg2 is a member of the N-Myc downstream-regulated genes. Interestingly, repeated ECT also significantly decreased Ndrg2 expression in this region of the brain. These data suggest that Ndrg2 may be a common functional molecule that is decreased after antidepressant treatment and ECT. Although, the functional role of Ndrg2 in the central nervous system remains unclear, our findings suggest that Ndrg2 may be associated with treatment-induced adaptive neural plasticity in the brain, a chronic target of antidepressant action. In conclusion, we have identified Ndrg2 as a candidate target molecule of antidepressants and ECT.",Excluded

The radiobiologic parameters that characterized the dose-response survival curve for these cells were found to be n = 1.9, Dq = 140 rad, and D0 = 190 rad. Morphologically, nuclear and cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolation of cytoplasm, and giant cell formation occurred in a dose dependent manner after 24 hours from irradiation. Decreased staining intensity for F VIII RAg was observed in morphologically affected cells. The capacity to synthesize PGI2 was significantly enhanced at 24 hours, but less significant at 72 hours after irradiation. The present data suggest that the radiosensitivity of brain capillary endothelial cells may be somewhat lower than that of endothelial cells originated from larger vessels, and that radiation induced morphological and functional changes in the brain capillary endothelial cells may be quantitatively similar to the changes in endothelial cells of larger vessels.",Included
1290,"Can a comparison of clinical and deep space irradiation scenarios shed light on the radiation response of the brain? Not surprisingly, our knowledge of the impact of radiation on the brain has evolved considerably. Decades of work have struggled with identifying the critical cellular targets in the brain, the latency of functional change and understanding how irradiation alters the balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits. Radiation-induced cell kill following clinical fractionation paradigms pointed to both stromal and parenchymal targets but also defined an exquisite sensitivity of neurogenic populations of newly born cells in the brain. It became more and more apparent too, that acute (days) events transpiring after exposure were poorly prognostic of the late (months-years) waves of radiation injury believed to underlie neurocognitive deficits. Much of these gaps in knowledge persisted as NASA became interested in how exposure to much different radiation types, doses and dose rates that characterize the space radiation environment might impair central nervous system functionality, with possibly negative implications for deep space travel. Now emerging evidence from researchers engaged in clinical, translational and environmental radiation sciences have begun to fill these gaps and have uncovered some surprising similarities in the response of the brain to seemingly disparate exposure scenarios. This article highlights many of the commonalities between the vastly different irradiation paradigms that distinguish clinical treatments from occupational exposures in deep space.",Excluded

Among the many phenotypic differences between mutant and wild-type IDH1/2 gliomas, the most salient is that IDH1/2 mutant glioma patients demonstrate markedly improved survival compared with IDH1/2 wild-type glioma patients. To address the mechanism underlying the superior clinical outcome of IDH1/2 mutant glioma patients, we investigated whether overexpression of the IDH1(R132H) protein could affect response to therapy in the context of an isogenic glioma cell background. Stable clonal U87MG and U373MG cell lines overexpressing IDH1(WT) and IDH1(R132H) were generated, as well as U87MG cell lines overexpressing IDH2(WT) and IDH2(R172K). In vitro experiments were conducted to characterize baseline growth and migration and response to radiation and temozolomide. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured under various conditions. U87MG-IDH1(R132H) cells, U373MG-IDH1(R132H) cells, and U87MG-IDH2(R172K) cells demonstrated increased sensitivity to radiation but not to temozolomide. Radiosensitization of U87MG-IDH1(R132H) cells was accompanied by increased apoptosis and accentuated ROS generation, and this effect was abrogated by the presence of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine. Interestingly, U87MG-IDH1(R132H) cells also displayed decreased growth at higher cell density and in soft agar, as well as decreased migration. Overexpression of IDH1(R132H) and IDH2(R172K) mutant protein in glioblastoma cells resulted in increased radiation sensitivity and altered ROS metabolism and suppression of growth and migration in vitro. These findings provide insight into possible mechanisms contributing to the improved outcomes observed in patients with IDH1/2 mutant gliomas.",Excluded

Epidemiological studies in this occupational group have been conducted over the last 15-20 years, usually with a focus on radiation-associated cancer. These studies are summarised in this note. Overall cancer risk was not elevated in most studies and subpopulations analysed, while malignant melanoma, other skin cancers and breast cancer in female aircrew have shown elevated incidence, with lesser risk elevations in terms of mortality. In some studies, including the large German cohort, brain cancer risk appears elevated. Cardiovascular mortality risks were generally very low. Dose information for pilots was usually derived from calculation procedures based on routine licence information, types of aircraft and routes/hours flown, but not on direct measurements. However, dose estimates have shown high validity when compared with measured values. No clear-cut dose-response patterns pointing to a higher risk for those with higher cumulative doses were found.

2370,"Some perturbations that disturb the circadian melatonin rhythm The circadian melatonin rhythm is highly reproducible and generally not easily altered. The few perturbations that are capable of significantly changing either the amplitude or the pattern of the 24-h melatonin rhythm are summarized herein. Aging alters cyclic melatonin production by decreasing the amplitude of the nocturnal melatonin peak in all species in which it has been studied. The best known acute suppressor of nocturnal melatonin is light exposure. The brightness of light required to acutely depress pineal melatonin production is species dependent; of the visible wavelengths, those in the blue range (approximately 500-520 nm) seem most effective in suppressing melatonin production. Nonvisible, nonionizing radiation in the extremely low frequency range (e.g., 60 Hz) seems also capable of altering pineal melatonin synthesis. Hormones have relatively little influence on the circadian production of melatonin, although either adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy does attenuate the amplitude of the melatonin cycle. Exercise at the time of high melatonin production rapidly depresses pineal concentrations of the indole without influencing its synthesis; the mechanism of this suppression remains unknown.

Materials/Methods: Nine radiation oncologists (3 attendings, 6 residents) contoured the lung tumor internal target volumes (ITVs) in 6 patients using maximum intensity projection (MIP) images after 4D-CT simulation. Contouring was performed independently at 3 separate time points: prior to training based on department standards, after completing contouring training, and >2 weeks after the second session. Contouring variability was evaluated for variations in the magnitude of volumes (coefficient of variation (COV) = standard deviation/mean volume), the volume overlap (conformality index (CI) = common volume/encompassing volume), and differences in the centroid location. Contours were also compared clinically to determine radiographic features resulting in larger disagreement. Result(s): The mean volumes in cm3 for session 1, 2 and 3 were 6.52, 6.98 and 7.20 respectively. The mean COV for sessions 1 (0.25 +/- 0.05), 2 (0.24 +/- 0.04) and 3 (0.19 +/- 0.03) demonstrated significant improvement from session 1 to 3 (p = 0.03) while the CI also improved with each session, 0.35 +/-0.07, 0.36 +/-0.03 and 0.44 +/-0.04, respectively (p = 0.03 from session 1 to 3). Average differences (mm) of the mean centroid positions in the lateral, anterior-posterior, and cranial-caudal directions demonstrated decreased variability from session 1, 0.3+/-0.3, 0.3+/-0.3 and 0.5+/-0.5, to session 3, 0.2+/-0.2, 0.2+/-0.2, 0.3+/-0.3 respectively (p = ns).

Conclusion(s): While there is large variation in contoured volumes, the centroid locations show excellent agreement. Intra- is smaller than interobserver variability; both can be improved with repeat contouring and standardized training, particularly in less experienced observers.

Our previous study did not observe serious CNS toxicity (Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1991;22:17-22). We now report on 5 patients who developed delayed significant CNS toxicity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We observed 5 patients with delayed CNS toxicity. The initial diagnosis was between 1981 and 2003. All patients had poor-risk disease according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Collaborative Group criteria. Of the 5 patients, 3 had CNS metastases at diagnosis and 2 developed relapses with CNS metastases. These 5 patients underwent WBRT to 4,000-5,000 cGy in 18-28 fractions concurrently with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.RESULTS: All 5 patients developed delayed symptoms consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The symptoms included seizures, hemiparesis, cranial neuropathy, headaches, blindness, dementia, and ataxia. The median time from WBRT to CNS symptoms was 72 months (range, 9-228). Head imaging revealed multiple abnormalities consistent with gliosis and diffuse cerebral atrophy. Of the 5 patients, 3 had progressive and 2 stable symptoms. Treatment with surgery and/or steroids had modest benefit. The progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy resulted in significant debility in all 5 patients, resulting in death (3 patients), loss of work, steroid-induced morbidity, and recurrent hospitalizations.CONCLUSION: Whole brain radiotherapy is not innocuous in young patients with germ cell tumors and can cause late CNS toxicity.",Excluded

To induce diabetes, male albino rats were injected with dexamethasone (10 mg/kg/day, for 9 successive days, subcutaneously). Different diabetic groups were irradiated with 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 Gy. The effect of low dose gamma irradiation on the hyperglycemia-induced brain damage based was analyzed at two levels: oxidative stress and apoptosis. The brain contents of glutathione, malondialdhyde and total nitrate/nitrite were measured to assess the oxidative stress. In order to evaluate the extent of the apoptotic changes in brain, tissue caspase-3 expression was detected using immunohistochemistry and the degree of DNA fragmentation was estimated. Moreover, brain tissues were examined using light microscopy to evaluate the histological changes in different groups and serum lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined as an indicator for the brain tissue damage. Results indicated that exposure to 0.5 Gy ameliorated the hyperglycemia and subsequently inhibited oxidative stress and apoptosis. Radiation exposure at this dose level also increased the survival rate of diabetic animals.",Excluded
3519,"IUdR polymers for combined continuous low-dose rate and high-dose rate sensitization of experimental human malignant gliomas Local polymeric delivery enhances IUdR radiosensitization of human malignant gliomas (MG). The combined low-dose rate (LDR) (0.03 Gy/h) and fractionated high-dose rate (HDR) treatments result in cures of experimental MGs. To enhance efficacy, we combined polymeric IUdR delivery, LDR, and HDR for treatments of both subcutaneous and intracranial MGs. In vitro: Cells (U251 MG) were trypsinized and replated in triplicate 1 day prior to LDR irradiation in media either without (control) or with 10 microM IUdR. After 72 hr, LDR irradiation cells were acutely irradiated (1.1 Gy/min) with increasing (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, or 10 Gy) single doses. Implantable IUdR polymers [(poly(bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)-propane) (PCPP): sebaic acid (PCPP:SA), 20:80] (50% loading; 10 mg) were synthesized. In vivo: For flank vs. intracranial tumors, mice had 6 x 10(6) subcutaneous vs. 2 x 10(5) intracranial cells. For intracranial or subcutaneous MGs, mice had intratumoral blank (empty) vs. IUdR polymer treatments. One day after implantation, mice had immediate external LDR (3 cGy/h x 3 days total body irradiation) or HDR (2 Gy BID x 4 days to tumor site) or concurrent treatments. For the in vitro IUdR treatments, LDR resulted in a striking increase in cell-killing when combined with HDR. For the in vivo LDR treatments of flank tumors, the growth delay was greater for the IUdR vs. blank polymer treatments. For the combined LDR and HDR, the IUdR treatments resulted in a dramatic decrease in tumor volumes. On day 60 the log V/V0 were -1.7 +/- 0.22 for combined LDR + HDR + IUdR polymer (P < 0.05 vs. combined LDR + HDR + blank polymer). Survival for the intracranial controls was 22.9 +/- 1.2 days. For the blank polymer + LDR vs. blank polymer + LDR + HDR treatments, survival was 25.3 +/- 1.7 (P = NS) vs. 48.1 +/- 3.5 days (P < 0.05). For IUdR polymer + LDR treatment survival was 27.3 +/- 2.3 days (P = NS). The most striking improvement in survival followed the IUdR polymer + LDR + HDR treatment: 66.0 + 6.4 days (P < 0.05 vs. blank polymer + LDR + HDR). The polymeric IUdR delivery plus combined continuous LDR and HDR treatments results in growth delay and improved survival in animals bearing the MG xenografts.

2697,"Effect of acid predissolution on fibril size and fibril flexibility of synthetic beta-amyloid peptide beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) is the major protein component of senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's patients. Several researchers have demonstrated that A beta is neurotoxic in in vitro and in vivo systems. Peptide aggregation state and/or conformation might play a significant role in determining the toxicity of the peptide. The size and flexibility of fibrils formed from the synthetic peptide beta (1-39), corresponding to the first 39 residues of A beta, were determined. Samples were prepared either directly from lyophilized peptide or diluted from a 10 mg/ml stock solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). All samples had a final peptide concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, a final pH of 7.4, and a final NaCl concentration of 0.14 M. The molecular weight and linear density of the fibrils increased with increasing pre-incubation time in TFA, based on static light scattering measurements. Analysis of the angular dependence of the intensity of scattered light indicated that the fibrils were semi-flexible chains and that the fibril flexibility decreased with increasing pre-incubation time in TFA. There was a concomitant change in phase behavior from precipitation to gelation with the decrease in fibril flexibility.",Excluded

The innervation and target nerves for radiofrequency denervation (RFD) of the SIJ remain unclear. We present a prospective case series on the treatment of intractable SIJ dysfunction with pulsed radiofrequency denervation (PRFD) of lateral branches from L4-S3.INTERVENTIONS: A total of 126 patients with presumptive SIJ dysfunction based on history and physical examination underwent arthrographically confirmed steroid/local anesthetic SIJ injection. Fifty-two patients (41.3%) had >75% pain relief after two consecutive injections, physical therapy, repeated SIJ injections, and/or analgesics. Twenty-two patients failed to respond. These patients underwent PRFD of the medial branch of L4, posterior primary rami of L5, and lateral branches S1 and S2.OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analog score (VAS) and quality of life (QOL) assessments were performed prior to and after treatment.RESULTS: Sixteen patients (72.7%) experienced ""Good"" (>50% reduction in VAS), or ""Excellent"" (>80% reduction in VAS) pain relief following PRFD. Duration of pain relief range was 6-9 weeks in four patients, 10-16 weeks in five patients, and 17-32 weeks in seven patients. In addition, QOL scores improved significantly in all measured categories. Six patients (26.1%) did not respond to PRFD and had less than 50% reduction in VAS and were considered failures.CONCLUSIONS: PRFD of the lateral branch of the medial branch of L4, posterior primary rami of L5, and lateral branches S1 and S2 is an effective treatment for some patients with SIJ pain unresponsive to other forms of therapy.",Excluded

A retrospective analysis was performed on 216 patients who underwent surgery for supratentorial gliomas. Primary explanatory variables were peritumoural and/or tumoural glutamate concentrations, glutamate transporter expression (EAAT2 and SXC). Univariate and multivariate survival analysis was performed with primary outcomes of time to first post-operative seizure and overall survival. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with de novo glioblastomas who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. 47 (21.8 %), 34 (15.8 %) and 135 (62.5 %) WHO grade II, III and IV gliomas respectively were followed for a median of 15.8 months. Following multivariate analysis, there was a non-significant association between higher peritumoural glutamate concentrations and time to first post-operative seizure (HR 2.07, CI 0.98-4.37, p = 0.06). In subgroup analysis of 81 glioblastoma patients who received adjunct chemoradiotherapy, peritumoural glutamate concentration was significantly associated with time to first post-operative seizure (HR 3.10, CI 1.20-7.97, p = 0.02). In both the overall cohort and subgroup analysis no glutamate cycle biomarkers were predictive of overall survival. Increased concentrations of peritumoural glutamate were significantly associated with shorter periods of post-operative seizure freedom in patients with de novo glioblastomas treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. No glutamate cycle biomarkers were predictive of overall survival. These results suggest that therapies targeting glutamate may be beneficial in tumour associated epilepsy.",Excluded
651,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated.METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1.RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium.CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1.

2718,"Gamma irradiation inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in rats after arterial injury BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restenosis complicates a significant proportion of endovascular and open vascular procedures such as carotid endarterectomy. In contrast to the primary atheroma, restenosis is characterized by intimal hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesized that gamma radiation would reduce restenosis by limiting intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury.METHODS: To demonstrate the effect of gamma radiation on smooth muscle hyperplasia in vivo, a standardized bilateral carotid balloon catheter arterial injury was produced in 37 rats. A single dose of 750, 1500, or 2250 cGy (1cGy = 1 rad) gamma radiation was delivered to the right carotid artery at either 1 or 2 days after injury; the shielded contralateral carotid artery served as matched control. At 21 days after injury, vessels were perfusion-fixed in situ, and cross-sectional area of neointima was determined from axial sections using image analysis.RESULTS: Marked reductions in neointimal cross-sectional area were demonstrated in vessels subjected to 1500- and 2250-cGy radiation at both 1 and 2 days after injury. A less prominent effect was noted for 750 cGy, reaching statistical significance only at 2 days after injury. By two-way ANOVA, radiation dose (P = .0002), timing of radiation delivery (P = .003), and an interaction between timing and dose (P = .0278) were significantly associated with reduction in neointimal cross-sectional area. At 1500 cGy, delivery of radiation 1 day after injury inhibited neointimal hyperplasia more prominently than the same dose 2 days after injury; a dose-response relation was evident at 1 day.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation may be an important adjunctive therapy for reducing the incidence of restenosis after angioplasty or endarterectomy.",Included
2805,"Surface chemistry governs cellular tropism of nanoparticles in the brain Nanoparticles are of long-standing interest for the treatment of neurological diseases such as glioblastoma. Most past work focused on methods to introduce nanoparticles into the brain, suggesting that reaching the brain interstitium will be sufficient to ensure therapeutic efficacy. However, optimized nanoparticle design for drug delivery to the central nervous system is limited by our understanding of their cellular deposition in the brain. Here, we investigated the cellular fate of poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles presenting different surface chemistries, after administration by convection-enhanced delivery. We demonstrate that nanoparticles with 'stealth' properties mostly avoid internalization by all cell types, but internalization can be enhanced by functionalization with bio-adhesive end-groups. We also show that association rates measured in cultured cells predict the extent of internalization of nanoparticles in cell populations. Finally, evaluating therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic model of glioblastoma highlights the need to balance significant uptake without inducing adverse toxicity.",Excluded
3574,"Surface-Based Falff: A Potential Novel Biomarker for Prediction of Radiation Encephalopathy in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiation encephalopathy (RE) is an important potential complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who undergo radiotherapy (RT) that can affect the quality of life. However, a functional imaging biomarker of pre-symptomatic RE has not yet been established. This study aimed to assess radiation-induced gray matter functional alterations and explore fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) as an imaging biomarker for predicting or diagnosing RE in patients with NPC. A total of 60 patients with NPC were examined, 21 in the pre-RT cohort and 39 in the post-RT cohort. Patients in the post-RT cohort were further divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of RE in follow-up: post-RT <inf>non-RE</inf> (n = 21) and post-RT <inf>REproved</inf><inf>infollow-up</inf> (n = 18). Surface-based and volume-based fALFF were used to detect radiation-induced functional alterations. Functional derived features were then adopted to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of RE. We observed that surface-based fALFF could sensitively detect radiation-induced functional alterations in the intratemporal brain regions (such as the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus), as well as the extratemporal regions (such as the insula and prefrontal lobe); however, no significant intergroup differences were observed using volume-based fALFF. No significant correlation between fALFF and radiation dose to the ipsilateral temporal lobe was observed. Support vector machine (SVM) analysis revealed that surface-based fALFF in the bilateral superior temporal gyri and left insula exhibited impressive performance (accuracy = 80.49%) in identifying patients likely to develop RE. We conclude that surface-based fALFF may serve as a sensitive imaging biomarker in the prediction of RE. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Kang, Zeng, Li, Gao, Liu, Shi and Liao.",Included

However, it suffers from shallow tissue penetration of visible light with low ablation efficiency. This study reports a upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP)-based multiplex proteins activation tool to ablate deep-tissue neurons for locomotion modulation. By optimizing the dopant contents and nanoarchitecure, over 300-fold enhancement of blue (450-470 nm) and red (590-610 nm) emissions from UCNPs is achieved upon 808 nm irradiation. Such emissions simultaneously activate mini singlet oxygen generator and Chrimson, leading to boosted near infrared (NIR) light-induced neuronal ablation efficiency due to the synergism between singlet oxygen generation and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. The loss of neurons severely inhibits reverse locomotion, revealing the instructive role of neurons in controlling motor activity. The deep penetrance NIR light makes the current system feasible for in vivo deep-tissue neuron elimination.

2010,"CT evaluation of patient deep inspiration self-breath-holding: how precisely can patients reproduce the tumor position in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices? The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reproducibility of tumor position under patient deep inspiration self-breath-holding in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices, as well as to compare the reproducibility of deep inspiration self-breath-holding on the verbal command of a radiation technologist (Passive mode) with that initiated by patients' own estimation (Active mode). Twenty patients with lung cancer were shown how the tumor and diaphragm move during the respiration cycle. Patients were instructed to hold their breath during deep inspiration and reproduce identical tumor position as well as possible either by the Active mode or by the Passive mode. After patients had practiced self-breath-holding during deep inspiration, a set of three CT scans was obtained for each of the two modes of self-breath-holding (6 CT scans total) to obtain randomly timed images of 2 mm thickness in the vicinity of the tumor. The first three scans were performed during breath-hold using the Active mode, and next three scans were using the Passive mode. Maximum difference in tumor position for the three CT scans was then calculated along three axes: cranial-caudal (C-C); anterior-posterior (A-P); and right-left (R-L). In the 20 patients who underwent analysis of self-breath-holding, mean maximum difference in tumor position obtained under breath-hold using the Active and the Passive modes were: 2.2 and 3.1 mm along the C-C axis; 1.4 and 2.4 mm along the A-P axis; and 1.3 and 2.2 mm along the R-L axis, respectively. These differences in all axes were significantly smaller (p<0.05) for the Active mode than for the Passive mode. Most tumors displayed maximal respiratory movement along the C-C axis, and minimal movement along the R-L axis, but tumors located in the upper lung displayed maximal movement along the A-P axis. Significant correlation (p<0.05) was observed between differences along three axes in either mode of breath-hold. In conclusion, the reproducibility of tumor position under self-breath-holding by patients during deep inspiration after sufficient practice and in the absence of respiratory monitoring devices was satisfactorily accurate, and differences in tumor position were smaller under breath-holding using the Active mode than using the Passive mode. We believe this new technique is likely to prove extremely useful for the irradiation of lung tumors with a small internal margin and for reduced proportion of high-dose irradiated normal lung to total lung volume.",Excluded
2580,"Adrenergic control of rat pineal NO synthase We have previously shown that exposure of rats to constant light (LL) induced a decrease in NO synthase (NOS) activity in the pineal gland. We present here the evidence that chronic (5 days) norepinephrine (NE) or isoproterenol treatment prevents the effect of LL and enhances pineal NOS activity in LL animals. This effect of NE appears to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, because it was not mimicked by the alpha-agonist phenylephrine. Pineal NOS activity was reduced in 16-h light/8-h dark animals treated for 4 days with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but not with the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin, indicating again an involvement of beta-adrenergic receptor in the control of NOS. Treatment with adrenergic antagonists did not affect cortical NOS activity, suggesting that the control of NOS is different in these two tissues or that the pineal expresses a specific isoform of the enzyme. Taken together, these data suggest that NE controls NOS in the pineal gland through beta-adrenergic receptors. To our knowledge, this represent the first demonstration of a regulation of NOS by a neurotransmitter in the CNS, as assayed under Vmax conditions.",Excluded

Early tumor treatment should be given to patients with newly diagnosed low-grade gliomas who are over age 50 years, those who have headaches or neurologic deficits other than seizures, or those whose neuroimaging studies show tumor growth or mass effect. For younger patients presenting with seizures and no other neurologic symptoms, it is reasonable to defer therapy until there is clinical or radiographic tumor progression. When it is judged that intervention is necessary, patients should undergo to maximal surgical tumor resection, which preserves or improves neurologic function. For younger (<50 years) astrocytoma patients with a good tumor resection, radiation may be deferred until tumor progression. Early radiation should be given to astrocytoma patients who are older than 50 years of age at diagnosis (regardless of the type of surgery) or to younger patients who are judged to require early intervention but who are not candidates for aggressive surgical resection. The radiation dose for low-grade glioma should be 4500 to 5000 cGy, preferably with three-dimensional conformal ports. The same guidelines for management apply to patients with low-grade oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma, except that chemotherapy is a reasonable alternative to radiation when it is judged that treatment other than surgical resection is required.

Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15.6 cm(3) (range 2.6-63 cm(3)). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20.3 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16.3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43.7 cm(3), with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61.6 CGyE in 16 fractions.RESULTS: In the HSRT group, 16/18 (89%) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2/18 (11%) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88% of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13%), 2 of them in the HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits.

542,"Metallothionein induction in human CNS in vitro: neuroprotection from ionizing radiation PURPOSE: There have been extensive studies on the regulation of metallothionein (MT) synthesis, and its biological role in liver and kidney. Although there are few reports on brain MT, there is a growing interest in the role of MT in brain. There have been no publications to date on MT synthesis in the human central nervous system (CNS) following exposure to ionizing radiation. In the present study, primary human CNS cultures were used to examine the effect of ionizing radiation on MT mRNA and protein synthesis. In the same cultures, the neuroprotective effects of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd)-induced MT synthesis from high-dose radiation were also examined.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary, serum-free, human CNS cultures were exposed to 30 or 60 Gy gamma-rays. The total MT protein was then measured by a Cd-heme assay, and mRNA for MT-II and MT-III was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cytotoxicity was measured by LDH release and apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis. Sublethal neuroglial injury was assessed morphologically using specific astrocytic (glial fibrillary acidic protein--GFAP) and neuronal (microtubule-associated protein 2--MAP2) immunohistochemical markers.RESULTS: The total MT protein content was increased 12h after exposure to 30Gy. The increase in MT content in response to 60Gy was not statistically significant. MT-II mRNA levels increased at 3 and 6h after exposure to 30Gy gamma-rays, with a maximum expression at 12-24 h. MT-III mRNA was not significantly affected. Exposure to 60 Gy, but not 30 Gy, caused a marked increase in LDH release. Cells exposed to 30 Gy or less showed some apoptotic cell death by DNA fragmentation analysis, while exposure to 60 Gy resulted in a DNA smear confirmed by LDH assays. Preinduction of MT by 5 microM Cd or 100 microM Zn resulted in a significant reduction in radiation-induced LDH release. Morphological evaluations revealed that Cd or Zn preincubation led to relative preservation of MAP2 staining and GFAP.CONCLUSION: Both MT protein and MT-II mRNA can be induced in human CNS cells by ionizing radiation. Furthermore, induction of MT synthesis with Zn and Cd can protect human CNS cells from radiation-induced cytocidal and sublethal injuries. Both findings have implications in the development of strategies to protect human CNS tissue from damage during radiotherapy.",Included
1746,"Differential expression of Homer1a in the hippocampus and cortex likely plays a role in radiation-induced brain injury Fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation is the primary treatment for metastatic brain tumors. Despite reducing tumor burden and increasing lifespan, progressive, irreversible cognitive impairment occurs in >50% of the patients who survive >6 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this radiation-induced brain injury are unknown; however, preclinical studies suggest that radiation modulates the extracellular receptor kinase signaling pathway, which is associated with cognitive impairment in many neurological diseases. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the extracellular receptor kinase transcriptionally-regulated early response gene, Homer1a, was up-regulated transiently in the hippocampus and down-regulated in the cortex of young adult male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats at 48 h after 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation. Two months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation, these changes in Homer1a expression correlated with a down-regulation of the hippocampal glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma, and an up-regulation of cortical glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma. Two drugs that prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats, the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, reversed the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced Homer1a expression at 48 h in the hippocampus and cortex and restored glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase Cgamma to the levels in sham-irradiated controls at 2 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation.

1074,"Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy enhances radiation-induced abscopal response in glioblastoma Introduction: Immunotherapy for glioblastoma have been largely unsuccessful, in part, because molecular heterogeneity drives selective elimination of only a subset of tumor cells. Therefore, therapeutic success in patients will require achieving an 'abscopal effect' where following focused radiation therapy, non-targeted tumor cells are attacked by the immune system. It remains unclear how glioblastoma respond to focused radiation in terms of failure location and whether immunotherapy could amplify the immune response to tumor outside the radiation field. Method(s): We evaluated patterns of treatment failure and outcomes in glioblastoma patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; N=47). To optimize the abscopal effect, we developed a genetically-engineered mouse model of bilateral glioblastoma. Here, one side of the mouse brain has a tumor treated by focal radiation and the contralateral untreated tumor is used as a readout of abscopal therapeutic efficacy following anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. Result(s): In glioblastoma patients receiving SRS, increasing age (>60 years) as associated with more 'out of field' treatment failure (P=0.036) and poor survival (P=0.001). In mice, we find that focal radiation of one tumor combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy induced an immunological response against tumor cells outside the radiation field and enhanced survival (P<0.05). Significant macrophage and T-cell infiltration occurred in mesenchymal subtype-like tumors (N=6-8 mice per group, P <0.01). In proneural subtype-like tumors, macrophage infiltration alone was associated with 'out of field' tumor regression (N=8 mice per group, P<0.05). In-vitro, treatment of mouse macrophages with anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced significant gene expression changes and enhanced phagocytosis in an ERK-dependent fashion. All 3 commercially available human anti-PD-L1 antibodies also induced ERK signaling with varying efficacies. Conclusion(s): Focal radiation combined with anti-PD-L1 therapy induces an immunological response to un-irradiated glioblastoma. We are currently optimizing other treatment combinations that could also be readily assessed in phase I human clinical trials.",Excluded
3045,"Flow effect impacts NIRS, jeopardizing quantification of tissue hemoglobin It has been generally agreed that changes in light transmission detected by NIRS are not exclusively attributable to hemoglobin changes, but also include a contribution from scattering by constituents of the brain tissue, which is not transparent, but turbid. If the light scattering is constant, light transmission can be quantified by an equation similar to Lambert-Beer's law. However, upon brain activation, it is known that the blood flow invariably increases. We have shown that light scattering by blood per se increases flow-dependently, interfering with the measurement of the intrinsic signals from hemoglobin. I call this the flow effect. Here, in responses to Pourtian's comments, I present additional evidence of the flow effect, which arises from RBC aggregation/dispersion, and further point out the inappropriateness of using NIR range wavelengths for the quantification of blood hemoglobin, even though their use is unavoidable in practice, because this wavelength range offers the best transmission through the tissue. In summary, I believe that the NIRS signal is a function of both flow (flow effect, which becomes the predominant contributor when blood flow increases) and metabolism (blood oxygenation change, which becomes accordingly a minor contributor). If the contribution of the flow effect is unknown, any mathematical equation describing the hemoglobin oxygenation is a Pfaffian equation which has no solution. This does not mean that I deny the clinical usefulness of NIRS, which definitely provides an indication of some biological changes in the brain in response to stimuli. However, great care is needed in the interpretation of the signals.",Excluded

Since GBM develops resistance to conventional therapies, treatment with C-ions is promising to completely eradicate the tumoural mass. During cranial irradiation, exposure of healthy tissues is inevitable. Because of the presence of neural stem cells, a deep investigation on the effects of C-ion irradiation with respect to X-ray induced damage is mandatory to allow a better definition of treatments. In this work, the comparison of X-rays and C-ion irradiation-induced effects on human neural stem cell, focusing on multiple endpoints, such as cell viability, cytokine secretion and spheroid formation is presented. Results show different temporal and dose responses of human neural stem cells to the different radiation qualities, suggesting different underpinning mechanisms of radiation-induced damages.",Included

This response consists of a relaxation (0.5-7.5 micrograms/ml PI) and rewinding phase (10-50 micrograms/ml PI), the latter of which is impaired by the presence of DNA strand breaks in irradiated cells. In addition to the inhibition of DNA rewinding seen immediately after irradiation at 0 degrees C, the supercoiling response of AT diploid fibroblasts indicated an increased amount of DNA unwinding compared to fibroblasts from unaffected individuals. This difference appeared to saturate, since the excess in DNA loop size over that seen in irradiated fibroblasts from unaffected individuals remained constant after 5 Gy. These results may reflect a greater instability of the DNA-nuclear matrix attachment points in irradiated AT fibroblasts. The DNA supercoiling response in irradiated transformed AT fibroblasts and AT lymphoblasts did not differ from that observed in unaffected cells of the same type. However, all of the immortalized cell lines (AT and unaffected) had inherently larger DNA loop sizes than diploid fibroblasts and exhibited excess unwinding after irradiation.",Excluded
2859,"Cancer therapy, vomiting, and antiemetics Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cancer are capable of causing nausea and vomiting. With both treatment modalities, the nausea and vomiting is thought to be a second-order process rather than being due to direct stimulation of neuromechanisms that control vomiting. Both a peripheral (gastrointestinal tract) and central (chemoreceptor trigger zone) effect may be operating with both radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced vomiting. With radiotherapy, gastrointestinal toxicity is affected by the type of radiation, radiation dose and field size, fractionation schedule, individual patient factors, and the part of the patient that is radiated. Many different factors also influence the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. With both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting is probably mediated by a reduction in breakdown of various neurotransmitters. It is presumed that as the levels of neurotransmitters increase, nausea and vomiting develop. Antagonists of these neurotransmitters may afford some antiemetic protection. Nausea and vomiting may be so severe in patients with cancer that they may refuse potentially curative therapy because of it. Anticipatory nausea and vomiting may develop in patients who have become quite sick after receiving treatment. Exposure to stimuli associated with the emetogenic agent is then sufficient to trigger nausea and vomiting. Standard antiemetics do not help anticipatory nausea and vomiting, although behavioural training may. A variety of different drugs have proven useful as antiemetics, including dopamine antagonists such as phenothiazines, metoclopramide, corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), cannabinoids, and benzodiazapines. Antihistamines and anticholinergics are of value in some situations. New serotonin antagonists appear to be very promising and are currently undergoing clinical studies. Multiagent antiemetic regimens appear to be more effective than single agent regimens in some situations. [References: 123]",Excluded
3051,"Benefits of dual energy CT imaging for differentiating contrast staining versus haemorrhage in post thrombectomy patients Background: Due to the increase in Neurological Thrombectomy cases, we reviewed our 24 hour post procedural unenhanced CT head scan implemented to look for haemorrhagic transformation within the infarct. High attenuation signal can frequently be seen on unenhanced CT scan in these patients within the core infarct and is impossible to differentiate between iodine staining or haemorrhagic transformation. Evaluation of these images has always been subjective with no true diagnosis. Dual Energy CT is an established imaging modality in differentiation of iodine and haemorrhage in high density lesions, post clot retrieval or after contrast administration. Dual energy CT involves acquiring two simultaneous attenuation datasets at a high and low kV. The ratio of the difference in Hounsfield units in these two datasets gives us the ability to accurately differentiate different tissues. Utilising three material decomposition and iodine maps, virtual non-contrast images are created on the Syngo VIA workstation Case studies: A Siemens Dual Source CT scanner was utilised to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and/or haemorrhagic transformation in the case study patients that underwent clot retrieval. This is a robust method of differentiating between haemorrhage and/or iodine staining. Conclusion(s): The ability to accurately differentiate between iodine staining and haemorrhage in post thrombectomy patients in a single scan has numerous benefits. The treating team can adapt anticoagulant therapy with confidence, nursing time spent doing regular observations is greatly reduced if no haemorrhage is identified, patients can be expedited to rehabilitation wards, and radiation dose from repeat scans is eliminated.",Excluded
3297,"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery: a new treatment strategy for giant cavernous sinus hemangiomas OBJECTIVE Cavernous sinus hemangiomas (CSHs) are rare benign vascular tumors that arise from the dural venous sinuses lateral to the sella. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has emerged as a principal alternative to microresection for small- and medium-sized CSHs. Resection is a reasonable option for large (3-4 cm in diameter) and giant (> 4 cm in diameter) CSHs. However, management of giant CSHs remains a challenge for neurosurgeons because of the high rates of morbidity and even death that stem from uncontrollable and massive hemorrhage during surgery. The authors report here the results of their study on the use of hypofractionated SRS (H-SRS) to treat giant CSH. METHODS Between January 2008 and April 2014, 31 patients with a giant CSH (tumor volume > 40 cm<sup>3</sup>, > 4 cm in diameter) treated using CyberKnife radiosurgery were enrolled in a cohort study. Clinical status and targeted reduction of tumor volume were evaluated by means of serial MRI. The diagnosis for 27 patients was determined on the basis of typical imaging features. In 4 patients, the diagnosis of CSH was confirmed histopathologically. The median CSH volume was 64.4 cm<sup>3</sup> (range 40.9-145.3 cm<sup>3</sup>). Three or 4 sessions of CyberKnife radiosurgery were used with a prescription dose based on the intent to cover the entire tumor with a higher dose while ensuring dose limitation to the visual pathways and brainstem. The median marginal dose to the tumor was 21 Gy (range 19.5-21 Gy) in 3 fractions for 11 patients and 22 Gy (range 18-22 Gy) in 4 fractions for 20 patients. RESULTS The median duration of follow-up was 30 months (range 6-78 months) for all patients. Follow-up MRI scans revealed a median tumor volume reduction of 88.1% (62.3%-99.4%) at last examination compared with the pretreatment volume. Ten patients developed new or aggravated temporary headache and 5 experienced vomiting during the treatment; these acute symptoms were relieved completely after steroid administration. Among the 30 patients with symptoms observed before treatment, 19 achieved complete symptomatic remission, and 11 had partial remission. One patient reported seizures, which were controlled after antiepileptic drug administration. No radiation-induced neurological deficits or delayed complications were reported during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Hypofractionated SRS was an effective and safe modality for treating giant CSH. Considering the risks involved with microsurgery, it is possible that H-SRS might be able to serve as a definitive primary treatment option for giant CSH.",Excluded

Camelid single-domain antibody-fragments (sdAbs) have been demonstrated to possess favorable properties for detecting and treating cancerous lesions in vivo using different radiolabeling methods. Here we evaluate the anti-HER2 sdAb 2Rs15d, coupled to diagnostic gamma- and therapeutic alpha- and beta --emitting radionuclides for the detection and treatment of HER2pos brain lesions in a preclinical setting. 2Rs15d was radiolabeled with 111In, 225Ac and 131I using DTPA- and DOTA-based bifunctional chelators and Sn-precursor of SGMIB respectively and evaluated in orthotopic tumor-bearing athymic nude mice. Therapeutic efficacy as well as systemic toxicity were determined for 131I- and 225Ac-labeled sdAbs and compared to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab in two different HER2pos tumor models. Radiolabeled 2Rs15d showed high and specific tumor uptake in both HER2pos SK-OV-3-Luc-IP1 and HER2pos MDA-MB-231Br brain lesions, whereas radiolabeled trastuzumab was unable to accumulate in intracranial SK-OV-3-Luc-IP1 tumors. Administration of [131I]-2Rs15d and [225Ac]-2Rs15d alone and in combination with trastuzumab showed a significant increase in median survival in 2 tumor models that remained largely unresponsive to trastuzumab treatment alone. Histopathological analysis revealed no significant early toxicity. Radiolabeled sdAbs prove to be promising vehicles for molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy of metastatic lesions in the brain.

2532,"The distinctive cellular responses to DNA strand breaks caused by a DNA topoisomerase I poison in conjunction with DNA replication and RNA transcription Camptothecin (CPT) inhibits DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) through a non-catalytic mechanism that stabilizes the Top1-DNA cleavage complex (Top1cc) and blocks the DNA re-ligation step, resulting in the accumulation in the genome of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), which are converted to secondary strand breaks when they collide with the DNA replication and RNA transcription machinery. DNA strand breaks mediated by replication, which have one DNA end, are distinct in repair from the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that have two ends and are caused by ionizing radiation and other agents. In contrast to two-ended DSBs, such one-ended DSBs are preferentially repaired through the homologous recombination pathway. Conversely, the repair of one-ended DSBs by the non-homologous end-joining pathway is harmful for cells and leads to cell death. The choice of repair pathway has a crucial impact on cell fate and influences the efficacy of anticancer drugs such as CPT derivatives. In addition to replication-mediated one-ended DSBs, transcription also generates DNA strand breaks upon collision with the Top1cc. Some reports suggest that transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks correlate with neurodegenerative diseases. However, the details of the repair mechanisms of, and cellular responses to, transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks still remain unclear. In this review, combining our recent results and those of previous reports, we introduce and discuss the responses to CPT-induced DNA damage mediated by DNA replication and RNA transcription.

1881,"Acid-induced unfolding of brain-derived neurotrophic factor results in the formation of a monomeric ""a state"" Recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor in acid undergoes a slow loss of tertiary structure as monitored by both near-UV circular dichroism and fluorescence, and appears to retain some secondary structure, as monitored by far-UV circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This loss of tertiary structure parallels a decrease in the weight average molecular weight, from dimer to monomer, when examined using light scattering. Increasing the temperature accelerates this slow reaction. This process may be described most simply as N2 in equilibrium with 2D where N and D are the native and denatured forms of the protein, respectively. However, the acid denaturation strongly depends on the protein concentration, with higher concentration resulting in a lower rate and extent of denaturation. This suggests that the more complicated mechanism N2 in equilibrium with 2N in equilibrium with 2D more accurately describes the denaturation, where the dissociation into a native monomer is the rate-limiting step, and the conversion of N to D occurs relatively rapidly. Size-exclusion chromatography (at neutral pH) at several points during denaturation further demonstrated that the amount of tertiary structure remaining paralleled the dimer concentration and also that the monomer form was long-lived, remaining as monomer during the course of the chromatography. Size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity determination indicated that the acid-denatured form is a compact molecule. On the basis of the above data, the acid-denatured form may be considered to be a monomeric compact intermediate A state with no tertiary structure but considerable secondary structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

However, irradiated patients had a greater impairment in the quality of life (QoL), a higher fat mass, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and a lower bone mineral content (BMC) than non-irradiated patients. Treatment with GH induced similar changes in both groups. After 1 year of GH replacement, there was an increase in serum IGF-I and fat-free mass, a reduction in fat mass and an improvement in QoL, all changes being equivalent in irradiated and non-irradiated patients. The lipid profile also improved with the irradiated patients showing a better response.

MATERIAL & METHODS: Fifty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups; control (C), radiation-early period (1 week) (Rd-E), radiation-late period (10 weeks) (Rd-L), Rd-E and resveratrol (Rd-E-RVT) and Rd-L and resveratrol treatment (Rd-L-RVT). Irradiation was performed based on the localized prostate cancer treatment protocol as a total of 20Gy. Resveratrol was given 10mg/kg orally 1 week for Rd-E-RVT group and 10 weeks for Rd-L-RVT. At the end of the experiment, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements were performed and rats were sacrificed for tissue collection. RESULT(S): Malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 activities were increased in both early and late irradiation groups as the latter being more elevated. Resveratrol treatment reversed these parameters back to control levels in both Rd- E-RVT and Rd-L-RVT groups. Glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in Rd-E and Rd-L groups and were reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment in both early and late periods. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities, cyclic GMP (c-GMP) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were decreased in the early period of irradiation however this difference doesn't have statistical significance. These parameters were decreased significantly in Rd-L group and resveratrol treatment reversed these values back to control levels. Sirtuin-1 protein expression was similar in both Rd-E and Rd-E-RVT groups however the protein expression was decreased in the late radiation period which is reversed back to control levels with resveratrol treatment. Intracavernosal pressure measurements were performed only in the late period as erectile dysfunction is a late complication of irradiation. The ICP/MAP ratio was significantly decreased in Rd-L group and was significantly reversed back to control levels with RvT treatment.

The rats were then followed and killed at various times afterward. Serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were assayed as well as prostaglandin synthesis. Microvessel permeability was assessed by quantitative evaluation of Evans blue dye extravasation.RESULTS: None of the rats developed neurologic dysfunction, and histologic examination revealed only occasional gliosis in the ventral white matter at 240 days after irradiation. Serotonin levels were unchanged at 2, 14, and 56 days after radiation but increased at 120 and 240 days in the irradiated cord segments when compared to both the nonirradiated thoracic and cervical segments (p < 0.01) and age-matched controls (p < 0.03). The calculated utilization ratio of serotonin (5-HIAA/5-HT) remained unchanged. Immediately after radiation (at 3 and 24 h) an abrupt but brief increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), thromboxane (TXB2), and prostacyclin [6 keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF)] was noted, which returned to normal at 3 days. This was followed after 7 and 14 days by a significant fall off in synthesis of all three prostaglandins. Thereafter, at 28, 56, 120, and 240 days, escalated production of thromboxane followed, while prostacyclin synthesis remained markedly reduced (-88% of control level at 240 days). Up to 7 days after radiation the calculated TXB2/6KPGF ratio remained balanced, regardless of the observed abrupt early fluctuations in their rate of synthesis. Later, between 7 and 240 days after radiation, a significant imbalance was present which became more pronounced over time. In the first 24 h after radiation, a 104% increase in microvessel permeability was observed which returned to normal by 3 days. Normal permeability was maintained at 14 and 28 days, but at 120 and 240 days a persistent and significant increase of 98% and 73% respectively above control level was noted.CONCLUSIONS: Radiation induces severe impairment in microvessel function even in the histologically unaffected spinal cord, and alters the secretory phenotype of various cell systems in the central nervous system.",Included

The main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a new quinolone derivative; 2-(1-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid (EHQA) and its possible mechanism against gamma radiation (IRR) and cisplatin (Cis) induced nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity in mice. The structure of the newly synthesized quinolone derivative was elucidated by microanalytical and spectral data, which were found consistent with the assigned structures. Exposure to Cis and IRR significantly induced renal damage manifested by a significant increase in levels of urea and creatinine. Moreover, the exposure to both Cis and IRR significantly decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic protein; Bcl-2 in both renal and brain tissue homogenate accompanied by activation of an inflammatory marker; IL-17. Immunophenoting results showed an activation of T- lymphocytes marker; CD3 and B-lymphocytes marker; CD19. Interperitonial administration of EHQA significantly ameliorated the above-mentioned parameters.

2115,"""Low-intensity laser therapy effect on the recovery of traumatic spinal cord injury"" Scientific advances have been made to optimize the healing process in spinal cord injury. Studies have been developed to obtain effective treatments in controlling the secondary injury that occurs after spinal cord injury, which substantially changes the prognosis. Low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) has been applied in neuroscience due to its anti-inflammatory effects on biological tissue in the repairing process. Few studies have been made associating LILT to the spinal cord injury. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the LILT (GaAlAs laser-780 nm) on the locomotor functional recovery, histomorphometric, and histopathological changes of the spinal cord after moderate traumatic injury in rats (spinal cord injury at T9 and T10). Thirty-one adult Wistar rats were used, which were divided into seven groups: control without surgery (n = 3), control surgery (n = 3), laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5), medullar lesion (n = 5) without phototherapy, medullar lesion + laser 6 h after surgery (n = 5), and medullar lesion + laser 48 h after surgery (n = 5). The assessment of the motor function was performed using Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and adapted Sciatic Functional Index (aSFI). The assessment of urinary dysfunction was clinically performed. After 21 days postoperative, the animals were euthanized for histological and histomorphometric analysis of the spinal cord. The results showed faster motor evolution in rats with spinal contusion treated with LILT, maintenance of the effectiveness of the urinary system, and preservation of nerve tissue in the lesion area, with a notorious inflammation control and increased number of nerve cells and connections. In conclusion, positive effects on spinal cord recovery after moderate traumatic spinal cord injury were shown after LILT.",Excluded
1368,"Effects of hypokinesia and hypodynamia upon protein turnover in hindlimb muscles of the rat Hypokinesia/hypodynamia was induced in the hindlimb muscles of the rat using a suspension technique. This caused differing degrees of atrophy in different muscles, however, this atrophy was reduced in muscles held in a lengthened position. The greatest degree of wasting was observed in the unstretched soleus, a slow postural muscle, where both Type 1 and Type 2a fibers atrophied to the same degree. However, wasting of the gastrocnemius muscle was associated with a reduction in the size of the Type 2b fibers. In both slow postural and fast phasic hindlimb muscles, atrophy was brought about by a reduction in the rate of protein synthesis in conjunction with an elevation in the rate of protein degradation. When inactive muscles were passively stretched, both protein synthesis and degradation were dramatically elevated. Even periods of stretch of as little as 0.5 h.d-1 were found to significantly decrease atrophy in inactive muscles.",Excluded

We investigated whether these radiation modalities improves the survival of patients with GBM. Sixty-eight cases of newly diagnosed GBM have been treated in our institution. After surgery, radiation therapy was performed using CRT with a dose of 60.0-61.2 Gy (n=36), hyperfractionated PBT concomitant with fractionated photon irradiation with a total dose of 96.6 Gy (n=17), or a single fraction of BNCT (n=15). In PBT, the surrounding volume of 2 cm from main tumor mass and the volume of perifocal edema were irradiated at dose of 75.6 and 60 Gy, respectively. The median OS time of the case series of BNCT for GBM has been reported as 13-20.7 M. In this study, the median OS and median time to MR change (TTM) for all patients were 25.7 and 11.9 M, respectively. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 85.7% and 45.5%, respectively. On the other hand, in the patients who underwent CRT and ACNU-based chemotherapy, OS and 2-year survival rate were 14.2M and 17.9%, respectively. In the patients who underwent high-dose PBT, OS and 2-year survival rate were 21.3M and 38.5%, respectively. The present small case series of selected patients showed survival benefit after BNCT. The comparison using previously reported prognostic factor-based classifications suggest that outcome of BNCT in terms of survival appeared to have non-inferiority compared to the standard therapy. With respect to the case series as a high-dose radiation trial, the outcome (OS: 9.5-25 M) of previously reported may still be comparable to that of BNCT. Randomized trials of comparably selected patients are required to demonstrate conclusively that prolonged survival is a result of this tumor-selective radiotherapy.",Excluded

666,"Model making of radioactive optic nerve injury. [Chinese] Background: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a severe complication after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, which threatens the visual acuity and quality of life of patients. Till now, there is no recognized treatment for RION. It is of great significance to study the natural progression of the RION, and to prevent and treat RION. Objective(s): This study was to establish an ideal radioactive optic nerve injury animal model. Method(s): Healthy 8-week SD rats with hygiene grade were randomly divided into normal control group and model group, with 6 rats in each group. The total 30 Gy dose of radiation with 3 portions was used to irradiate the head model group rats; ELISA was performed to analysis the changes of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and Von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentrations in blood 2, 4 and 8 weeks after irradiation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscope were performed to observe the changes of optic structure. The use and care of the experimental animals complied with the ARVO statement. Result(s): The concentrations of ET-1 in the model group were (23.18 +/- 0.11), (27.98 +/- 0.22), (33.90 +/- 0.11), (65.25 +/- 0.38) and (43.82 +/- 0.09) pg/ml before irradiation, 1 day, 2, 4, 6 weeks after irradiation, those in the normal control group were (22.65 +/- 0.14), (23.18 +/- 0.19), (23.68 +/- 0.15), (24.23 +/- 0.12) and (23.58 +/- 0.16) pg/ml. The concentrations of vWF in the model group were (63.16 +/- 2.21), (88.32 +/- 2.06), (123.38 +/- 1.36), (191.40 +/- 0.61) and (141.69 +/- 0.82) pg/ml before irradiation, 1 day, 2, 4, 6 weeks after irradiation, those in the normal control group were (62.82 +/- 1.56), (63.35 +/- 2.06), (64.12 +/- 1.76), (63.52 +/- 2.02) and (63.48 +/- 1.55)pg/ml. There were significant differences of ET-1 and vWF concentrations among different groups and time points (ET-1: F<inf>group</inf>=32.160, P=0.012 ; F<inf>time</inf>=21.180, P=0.023.vWF: F<inf>group</inf>=73.110, P=0.001; F<inf>time</inf>=46.180, P=0.002). The nerve fiber bundles was swelled with disordered arrangement and vacuolization 8 weeks after irradiation. Axon swell and atrophy, axons with myelin sheath layer plate separation were obtained. The rates of axon demyelination in the normal control group and model group were (1.35 +/- 0.79)% and (14.44 +/- 2.32)%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (t=14.07, P<0.01).

2451,"Glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic currents in ganglion cells from isolated retinae of pigmented rats during postnatal development This study was aimed at characterizing the earliest phases of synaptogenesis in the mammalian retina. Spontaneous activity of ganglion cells in the isolated superfused retina was used as an indicator for the functionality of synaptic connections. Retinal ganglion neurons (RGNs) were identified by location of their somata in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and by their ability to generate large (> 500 pA) voltage-activated sodium currents. Spontaneous spiking was found in many RGNs prior to cell perfusion. Between postnatal day (P) 1 and 18, a total of 195 RGNs was tested for light-induced currents, conductance changes in response to exogenous glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and depolarizing or hyperpolarizing synaptic activity. The vast majority of the material was derived from RGNs at day P5. Whole-cell ion currents were always sampled at somatic sites, using either conventional or perforated patch whole-cell recordings. On day P5, 5% of tested RGNs (n = 73) were already responsive to light stimulation. A higher percentage of cells (23%, n = 187) generated spontaneous depolarizing currents that were regarded as glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), since (1) they were blocked by Glu antagonists, (2) they conformed to the Na+/Cs+ equilibrium potential, (3) and they displayed a time course characteristic of glutamatergic EPSCs. The mean EPSC amplitude was 19.0 pA (S.D. 11.83 pA). Amplitude distributions were fitted by multiple Gaussian equations rendering a quantal size of 6.6 to 9.1 pA at a holding voltage (Vh) of -70 mV (driving force about 70 mV). Spontaneous EPSCs were never observed under condition of Ca(2+)-free solutions, but they persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin. Bath application of quisqualate (500 microM) consistently increased EPSC frequencies. In contrast to the relatively high percentage of RGNs generating spontaneous EPSCs, very few RGNs at P5 (3%, n = 187) displayed inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), although by that time all tested RGNs (n = 14) were responsive to both exogenous Glu and GABA. These results indicate that in the postnatal rat retina development of excitatory synapses precedes the maturation of inhibitory afferents. Excitatory inputs to RGNs were to some extent functional before the animals opened their eyes. Glutamatergic synaptic activity may, thus, play an important role in shaping visual connections in the absence of visual experience.",Excluded

In the hippocampus, a brain structure relevant for learning and memory processes, it acts both as a modulator and as a mediator of synaptic transmission, with implications for synaptic plasticity phenomena. Recent evidence suggests that ATP modulates activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. However, it remains unclear if ATP also modulates LTP counterpart's phenomenon, long-term depression (LTD), in the rat hippocampus. This study investigated the effect of ATP analogues on homosynaptic LTD, induced by low-frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals (1 Hz; 900 pulses) in the CA1 region of young rat hippocampal slices. The metabolically stable ATP analogues beta,gamma-ImATP (20 microM), a P2 receptor agonist, and alpha,beta-MeATP (20 microM), a preferential P2X(1,3) receptor agonist, did not modify LTD (LTD values of 14.7+/-0.5% and 14.1+/-3% for aCSF controls and of 15.1+/-4% and 19.0+/-5.2% for beta,gamma-ImATP and alpha,beta-MeATP, respectively).

Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 250 g were irradiated with 2450 MHz continuous-wave (CW) microwaves for 2 h at a specific absorption rate of 1.2 W/kg in a cylindrical waveguide system (Guy et al., Radio Sci. 14, 63-74, 1979). There was no associated rise in the core body temperature of the rats. After the irradiation or sham treatments, rats were euthanized by either CO2 asphyxia or decapitation by guillotine (eight pairs of animals per euthanasia group). After euthanasia the brains were removed and immediately immersed in cold Ames medium and the cells of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus were dissociated separately and subjected to the alkaline comet assay. Irrespective of whether the rats were euthanized by CO2 asphyxia or decapitated by guillotine, no significant differences were observed between either the comet length or the normalized comet moment of cells from either the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus of sham-treated rats and those from the irradiated rats. However, the data for the rats asphyxiated with CO2 showed more intrinsic DNA damage and more experiment-to-experiment variation than did the data for rats euthanized by guillotine. Therefore, the guillotine method of euthanasia is the most appropriate in studies relating to DNA damage. Furthermore, we did not confirm the observation that DNA damage is produced in cells of the rat cerebral cortex or the hippocampus after a 2-h exposure to 2450 MHz CW microwaves or at 4 h after the exposure.",Excluded
2804,"Possible involvement of hippocampal immediate-early genes in contextual fear memory deficit induced by cranial irradiation Cranial irradiation can trigger adverse effects on brain functions, including cognitive ability. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying radiation-induced cognitive impairments remain still unknown. Immediate-early genes (IEGs) are implicated in neuronal plasticity and the related functions (i.e., memory formation) in the hippocampus. The present study quantitatively assessed changes in the mRNA and protein levels of the learning-induced IEGs, including Arc, c-fos, and zif268, in the mouse hippocampus after cranial irradiation using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Mice (male, 8-week-old C57BL/6) received whole-brain irradiation with 0 or 10Gy of gamma-ray and, 2weeks later, contextual fear conditioning (CFC) was used to induce IEGs. In the CFC task, mice evaluated 2weeks after irradiation exhibited significant memory deficits compared with sham (0Gy)-irradiated controls. The levels of mRNA encoding IEGs were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus 10 and 30min after CFC training. The mRNA levels in the irradiated hippocampi were significantly lower than those in the sham-irradiated controls. The IEG protein levels were significantly increased in all hippocampal regions, including the hippocampal dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis (CA)1, and CA3, after CFC training. The CFC-induced upregulation of Arc and c-fos in 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi was significantly lower than that in sham-irradiated controls, although there were no significant differences in the protein levels of the learning-induced zif268 between sham-irradiated and 10Gy-irradiated hippocampi. Thus, cranial irradiation with 10Gy of gamma-ray impairs the induction of hippocampal IEGs (particularly Arc and c-fos) via behavioral contextual fear memory, and this disturbance may be associated with the memory deficits evident in mice after cranial irradiation, possibly through the dysregulation of neuronal plasticity during memory formation.",Included

Reduction of mice adult hippocampal neurogenesis was induced by cranial irradiation. LW-AFC was administered by oral gavage for 30 d after cranial irradiation treatment. Immunofluorescence and Nissl's staining were performed for histological morphology assessment. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining was used in the detection of proliferation cells. The peripheral blood and hippocampal homogenate were collected to measure the content of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (INF-y), interleukin-1 (3 (IL-1(3), IL-4 and IL-10. The hippocampal homogenate was used for Western blot to detect the BDNFkappaB signal pathway, including extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) and BDNF target protein. Morris water maze and new object recognition test were performed to examine the cognitive function of mice. The mice forced swimming and tail suspension test were used to assess alteration in depressive behavior. Long term potentiation was used to examine the synaptic plasticity change of mice. RESULTS Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced after irradiation of 20 Gray dose (10 Gray per day, total 2 d). LW-AFC treatment increased the BrdU number of irradiated mice (P<0.05). In Morris water maze test, LW-AFC group showed decreased escape latency in the learning period (P<0.05), while increased the number of crossing the platform in the memory period.

A total of 43 studies are reported and summarized: of these, 31 indicated a total absence of statistically significant difference between real and sham signal, 9 showed a partial improvement of attentional performance (mainly increase in speed of performance and/or improvement of accuracy) as a function of real exposure, while the remaining 3 showed inconsistent results (i.e., increased speed in some tasks and slowing in others) or even a worsening in performance (reduced speed and/or deteriorated accuracy). These results are independent of the specific attentional domain investigated. This scenario allows to conclude that there is a substantial lack of evidence about a negative influence of non-ionizing radiations on attention functioning.

942,"Brachytherapy radiation doses to the neurovascular bundles PURPOSE: To investigate the role of radiation dose to the neurovascular bundles (NVB) in brachytherapy-related impotence.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen Pd-103 or I-125 implant patients were studied. For patients treated with implant alone, the prostate and margin (clinical target volume [CTV]) received a prescription dose of 144 Gy for I-125 or 115 Gy for Pd-103. Two patients received Pd-103 (90 Gy) with 46 Gy supplemental external beam radiation (EBRT). Axial CT images were acquired 2 to 4 hours postoperatively for postimplant dosimetry. Because the NVBs cannot be visualized on CT, NVB calculation points were determined according to previously published anatomic descriptions. Bilateral NVB points were considered to lie posterior-laterally, approximately 2 mm from the prostatic capsule. NVB doses were recorded bilaterally, at 0.5-cm intervals from the prostatic base.RESULTS: For Pd-103, the average NVB doses ranged from 150 Gy to 260 Gy, or 130% to 226% of the prescription dose. For I-125, the average NVB dose ranged from 200 Gy to 325 Gy, or 140% to 225% of the prescription dose. These was no consistent relationship between the NVB dose and the distance from the prostatic base. To examine the possible effect of minor deviations of our calculation points from the true NVB location, we performed NVB calculations at points 2 mm medial or lateral from the NVB calculation point in 8 patients. Doses at these alternate calculation points were comparable, although there was greater variability with small changes in the calculation point if sources were located outside the capsule, near the NVB calculation point. Three patients who developed early postimplant impotence had maximal NVB doses that far exceeded the average values.CONCLUSIONS: In the next few years, we hope to clarify the role of high NVB radiation doses on potency, by correlating NVB dose calculations with a large number of patients enrolled in an ongoing I-125 versus Pd-103 trial for early-stage patients, for whom detailed dosimetric and potency data are being collected prospectively. In the future, we anticipate that NVB doses may be incorporated into dosimetry guidelines to maximize tumor control and minimize treatment-related morbidity.",Excluded
1678,"Radiation Induces Distinct Changes in Defined Subpopulations of Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells in the Adult Hippocampus While irradiation can effectively treat brain tumors, this therapy also causes cognitive impairments, some of which may stem from the disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis. To study how radiation affects neurogenesis, we combine phenotyping of subpopulations of hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells with double- and triple S-phase labeling paradigms. Using this approach, we reveal new features of division, survival, and differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells after exposure to gamma radiation. We show that dividing neural stem cells, while susceptible to damage induced by gamma rays, are less vulnerable than their rapidly amplifying progeny. We also show that dividing stem and progenitor cells that survive irradiation are suppressed in their ability to replicate 0.5-1 day after the radiation exposure. Suppression of division is also observed for cells that entered the cell cycle after irradiation or were not in the S phase at the time of exposure. Determining the longer term effects of irradiation, we found that 2 months after exposure, radiation-induced suppression of division is partially relieved for both stem and progenitor cells, without evidence for compensatory symmetric divisions as a means to restore the normal level of neurogenesis. By that time, most mature young neurons, born 2-4 weeks after the irradiation, still bear the consequences of radiation exposure, unlike younger neurons undergoing early stages of differentiation without overt signs of deficient maturation. Later, 6 months after an exposure to 5 Gy, cell proliferation and neurogenesis are further impaired, though neural stem cells are still available in the niche, and their pool is preserved. Our results indicate that various subpopulations of stem and progenitor cells in the adult hippocampus have different susceptibility to gamma radiation, and that neurogenesis, even after a temporary restoration, is impaired in the long term after exposure to gamma rays. Our study provides a framework for investigating critical issues of neural stem cell maintenance, aging, interaction with their microenvironment, and post-irradiation therapy.",Included

Doses as low as 10-50 cGy were able to induce reductions of the neurite outgrowth as compared to the control group. Neurite generation is a more sensitive parameter than neurite elongation, suggesting different mechanism of radiation damage in our model. These results showed that low doses/fluences of iron particles could impair the retinal ganglion cells' capacity to generate neurites indicating the highly neurotoxic capability of this heavy charged particle.",Included
1233,"Acrylamide neuropathy. III. Spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell damage in forebrain Previous studies of acrylamide (ACR) neuropathy in rat PNS [Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. (1998) 151:211-221] and in spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellum [NeuroToxicology (2002a) 23:397-414; NeuroToxicology (2002b) 23:415-429] have suggested that axon degeneration was not a primary effect and was, therefore, of unclear neurotoxicological significance. To conclude our studies of neurodegeneration in rat CNS during ACR neurotoxicity, a cupric silver stain method was used to define spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell body, dendrite, axon and terminal argyrophilia in forebrain regions and nuclei. Rats were exposed to ACR at a dose-rate of either 50 mg/kg per day (i.p.) or 21 mg/kg per day (p.o.) and at selected times brains were removed and processed for silver staining. Results show that intoxication at either ACR dose-rate produced a terminalopathy, i.e. nerve terminal degeneration and swelling were present in the absence of significant argyrophilic changes in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites or axons. Exposure to the higher ACR dose-rate caused early onset (day 5), widespread nerve terminal degeneration in most of the major forebrain areas, e.g. cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia. At the lower dose-rate, nerve terminal degeneration in the forebrain developed early (day 7) but exhibited a relatively limited spatial distribution, i.e. anteroventral thalamic nucleus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Several hippocampal regions were affected at a later time point (day 28), i.e. CA1 field and subicular complex. At both dose-rates, argyrophilic changes in forebrain nerve terminals developed prior to the onset of significant gait abnormalities. Thus, in forebrain, ACR intoxication produced a pure terminalopathy that developed prior to the onset of significant neurological changes and progressed as a function of exposure. Neither dose-rate used in this study was associated with axon degeneration in any forebrain region. Our findings indicate that nerve terminals were selectively affected in forebrain areas and, therefore, might be primary sites of ACR action.",Excluded
18,"High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue as initial therapy for anaplastic oligodendroglioma Purpose: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma is a chemosensitive glial neoplasm. To improve disease control and postpone cranial radiotherapy, we designed a phase II study of intensive procarbazine, lomunstine and vincristine followed by high-dose thiotepa with autologous stem cell rescue for patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic or aggressive oligodendroglioma. Patients and Methods: Sixty-nine patients with a median age of 42 (range: 18-67) and a median Karnofsky Performance Score of 90 (range: 70-100) were enrolled. Sixteen patients had a prior diagnosis of low-grade oligodendroglioma and 16 had mixed oligoastrocytoma pathology. Only patients with demonstrably chemosensitive enhancing tumors or those free of enhancing tumor after surgery and induction therapy were eligible to receive high-dose thiotepa. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients (57%) completed the transplant regimen; their estimated median progression-free survival is 69 months and median overall survival has not been reached. Twelve transplanted patients (31 %) relapsed. Neither histology nor prior low-grade oligodendroglioma correlated with relapse; however, persistent non-enhancing tumor at transplant conferred an increased risk of relapse (p = 0.028). The transplant regimen was well-tolerated; median hospital stay was 20 days (range: 7-43) with a median time to ANC and platelet engraftment of 10 days. Thirty patients (43%) did not receive high-dose thiotepa because of stable or progressive disease (n = 21), excessive toxicity (n = 4), refusal of further therapy (n = 2), failure to obtain insurance coverage (n = 2), or other (n - 1). No treatment-related or long-term neurotoxicity was seen in the transplanted patients. Conclusion(s): High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue as initial treatment for anaplastic oligodendroglioma is feasible and associated with prolonged tumor control in some patients.",Excluded

63,"Effect of short-duration spaceflight on thigh and leg muscle volume PURPOSE: Human skeletal muscle probably atrophies as a result of spaceflight, but few studies have examined this issue. Thus, little is known about the influence of microgravity upon human skeletal muscle, nor is it possible to assess the validity of ground based models of spaceflight. This study tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of spaceflight induced muscle atrophy would be a function of flight duration and greater than that of bed rest.METHODS: Three astronauts flew 9, 15, and 16 d in space. Volume of the knee extensor (quadriceps femoris), knee flexor (hamstrings, sartorius, and gracilis), and plantar flexor (triceps surae) muscle groups was measured using magnetic resonance imaging before and after spaceflight and during recovery. The volume of each muscle group in each image was determined by multiplying cross-sectional area by slice thickness. These values were subsequently summed to calculate muscle volume.RESULTS: Volume changes in the knee extensor, knee flexor, and plantar flexor muscle groups ranged from -15.4 to -5.5, -14.1 to -5.6, and -8.8 to -15.9%, respectively. Muscle volume decreases normalized by flight duration ranged from 0.62 to 1.04% x d(-1). These relative changes appeared to be greater than those that we have reported previously for bed rest (Akima et al., J. Gravitat. Physiol. 4:15-22, 1997).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that atrophy as a result of at least 2 wk of spaceflight varied among individuals and muscle groups and that the degree of atrophy appeared to be greater than that induced by 20 d of bed rest.",Excluded

2146,"Gamma radiation (5-10 Gy) impairs neuronal function in the guinea pig hippocampus Guinea pigs were exposed to 5 and 10 Gy gamma radiation. Hippocampal brain slices were isolated 30 min, 1 day, 3 days and 5 days after irradiation or sham irradiation and the electrophysiological characteristics of the neural tissue were evaluated. Both radiation doses elicited significant changes that were dependent on dose, dose rate and time. Synaptic efficacy decreased soon after exposure to 5 Gy at dose rates of both 1 and 20 Gy/min. Recovery occurred by 5 days. Ten grays at 20 Gy/min potentiated the postsynaptic potential 1 day after irradiation. By 3 days, synaptic efficacy was decreased and did not recover. The ability of the synaptic potentials to generate spikes was potentiated within 30 min after exposure to 5 Gy at 1 Gy/min and persisted through 3 days, with recovery at 5 days. At the 20 Gy/min dose rate, a similar potentiation did not result with 10 Gy and occurred only at 3 days after irradiation with 5 Gy. Rather, within 30 min and after 5 days, spike generation was significantly depressed by these exposures. Both synaptic efficacy and spike generation contribute to the net input-output relationship of the neuronal population. This relationship was profoundly decreased within 30 min with recovery at 1 day and subsequent decline with the higher dose rate in a dose-dependent manner. These persistent changes in neuronal function are likely to be a consequence of the actions of ionizing radiation on the physiological processes that influence the neuronal environment.",Included

A recommended diagnostic workup Background: Patients admitted for suspicion of shunt dysfunction (SD) often show unspecific symptoms and require time-consuming, expensive and even invasive diagnostics involving significant radiation exposure. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the current diagnostic procedures and to propose a process optimisation. Method(s): As all patients admitted for suspicion of SD receive imaging studies, we searched for adult patients receiving neuroimaging in the period from January 2010 to July 2013, analysing referring diagnosis, clinical signs, products, diagnostic process and final diagnosis. Recursive partitioning was used to define time intervals for differentiating types of SD. Result(s): A total of 148 patients, aged 18-89 (mean, 54) years, were studied. Forty-two percent were referred by a hospital or rehabilitation centre, 30% by general practitioners and 24% were self-referrals. The admission diagnosis was in the majority ""shunt dysfunction"" only. Further differentiations were rarely made. An SD was confirmed in 46% of the patients. In 17%, the symptoms were based on another cause and in 37% they could not be clearly attributed to any specific disorder. Abdominal dislocations (2%) and shunt infections (5%) were found within the first 6 months. Over- (3%) and under-drainage (14%) were the most frequent complications during the first 4 years. Disconnections (13%) occurred generally 4 years or more after implantation. Only shunt obstruction (9%) showed no temporal pattern. Conclusion(s): Symptoms of SD remain mostly unspecific. This study showed that the type of SD depends on the time interval from implantation. We propose a workup strategy for patients with SD based on the temporal profile.

3588,"Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery for resected brain metastases: A comparison of outcomes for large resection cavities PURPOSE: Although historical trials have established the role of surgical resection followed by whole brain irradiation (WBRT) for brain metastases, WBRT has recently been shown to cause significant neurocognitive decline. Many practitioners have employed postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to tumor resection cavities to increase local control without causing significant neurocognitive sequelae. However, studies analyzing outcomes of large brain metastases treated with resection and postoperative SRS are lacking. Here we compare outcomes in patients with large brain metastases >4 cm to those with smaller metastases <=4 cm treated with surgical resection followed by SRS to the resection cavity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Consecutive patients with brain metastases treated at our institution with surgical resection and postoperative SRS were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts based on preoperative maximal tumor dimension. Cumulative incidence of local failure, radiation necrosis, and death were analyzed for the 2 cohorts using a competing-risk model, defined as the time from SRS treatment date to the measured event, death, or last follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 117 consecutive cases were identified. Of these patients, 90 (77%) had preoperative tumors <=4 cm, and 27 (23%) >4 cm in greatest dimension. The only significant baseline difference between the 2 groups was a higher proportion of patients who underwent gross total resection in the <=4 cm compared with the >4 cm cohort, 76% versus 48%, respectively (P <.01). The 1-year rates of local failure, radiation necrosis, and overall survival for the <=4 cm and >4 cm cohorts were 12.3% and 16.0%, 26.9% and 28.4%, and 80.6% and 67.6%, respectively (all P >.05). The rates of local failure and radiation necrosis were not statistically different on multivariable analysis based on tumor size.CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases >4 cm in largest dimension managed by resection and radiosurgery to the tumor cavity have promising local control rates without a significant increase in radiation necrosis on our retrospective review.",Excluded

2715,"Case of a patient with bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis presenting with photosensitive attacks State the Purpose: Photosensitive attacks are not generally known as TIA. We experienced a patient with photosensitive attacks induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Method(s): A 60-year-old man presented to our hospital because he experienced photosensitive attacks, which first occurred 3 months previously. In the case of our patient, sunlight always induced a photosensitive attack, during which he was blinded for approximately 10 minutes. He did not experience convulsions, loss of consciousness, headache, and symptoms of amaurosis. Ophthalmological examination, electroencephalography, and brain computed tomography (CT) did not indicate any abnormal findings. The patient was exposed to cervical radiation for pharyngeal cancer approximately 16 years previously. He did not have migraine, diabetes, and any previous cerebrovascular disease. The patient had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which were not treated appropriately. Result(s): One month after visiting our hospital, he experienced transient ischemic attacks (TIA) with right hemiparesis. Thereafter, the patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed small cerebral infarctions. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed no abnormalities; however, ultrasound of the carotid artery showed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). Cerebral angiography also showed bilateral ICA stenosis (approximately 90%). A 99m-Technetium- ECD single-photon emission CT scan revealed low bilateral occipital perfusion. Because the bilateral ICA stenosis was induced by radiation, we decided to perform carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) instead of carotid endarterectomy. After CAS of the left carotid artery, the patient's photosensitivity completely disappeared. Conclusion(s): Photosensitive attacks are not generally known as TIA. In the present case, photosensitive attacks appear to have been induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.",Excluded
3,"Possible role of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and rutin in protection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in irradiated rats PURPOSE: To investigate the possible role of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and rutin in ameliorating the biochemical changes in brain and serum induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in whole body gamma-irradiated rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebral ischemia was induced in male Wistar rats (either irradiated or non-irradiated) followed by reperfusion.RESULTS: I/R increased brain content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and depleted its glutathione (GSH) content with a compensatory elevation in cytosolic activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) enzymes. It also raised brain cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and calcium (Ca(2+)) level. Furthermore, I/R provoked an inflammatory response reflected by an increment in serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interlukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Moreover, induction of I/R in irradiated rats resulted in a further increase in brain oxidative stress and cytosolic LDH activity, disturbed brain Ca(2+) homeostasis and exaggerated the inflammatory reaction. During irradiation, administration of each of vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and rutin to irradiated rats before induction of I/R, alleviated the brain oxidative stress. Moreover, these antioxidants caused attenuation of the rise of the cytosolic activities of GPx and GR. A lowering effect of the cytosolic LDH activity and Ca(2+) level were caused by treatment with antioxidants. Each of vitamin E and rutin revealed an anti-inflammatory action of these antioxidants, while CoQ10 had no effect on serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that supplementation with either vitamin E, CoQ10 or rutin ameliorated most of the biochemical changes induced by I/R in irradiated rat brain and serum.",Included
66,"Analysis of forces in conventional and ultrasonically assisted plane cutting of cortical bone Bone cutting is a well accepted but technically demanding surgical procedure in orthopaedics. A level of tool penetration force during cutting of bones has been the prime concern to surgeons, since it can produce unnecessary mechanical damage to surrounding tissues. Research in this area has been undertaken for many decades to find ways to minimise the cutting force. Cutting of bone with ultrasonic tools is a relatively new technique replacing conventional procedures in neuro-, dental and orthopaedic surgeries, due to its precision and safety. In this article, the level of forces produced during a chisel-like tool penetration in a fresh cortical bone is studied. The obtained force data are analysed for both conventional cutting and ultrasonically assisted cutting. Through a series of experiments, it was demonstrated that the depth of cut and parameters of ultrasonic oscillations affected the level of cutting force, the former being the main factor in both types of cutting. It was found that the tool penetration force was decreased with an increase in the ultrasonic frequency or amplitude and was not affected by the cutting speed. The rise in bone temperature was measured and was found to be insensitive to the level of cutting speed within the range used in this study.",Excluded

The distribution of the induced electric field was computed, and estimates of the relevant parameters were generated to predict the locus and type of neurons stimulated during TMS, assuming three different stimulation mechanisms.RESULTS: Tissue heterogeneity strongly affects the spatial distribution of the induced electric field and hence which stimulation mechanism is dominant and where it acts. Stimulation of neurons may occur in the gyrus, in the lip of the gyrus, and in the walls of the sulcus. The stimulated cells can be either pyramidal cells having medium to large caliber axons, or intracortical fibers of medium caliber.CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the influence of cortical folding on the action of magnetic and electric fields on cortical tissue.SIGNIFICANCE: Tissue geometry and heterogeneity in electrical conductivity both must be taken into account to predict accurately stimulation loci and mechanism in TMS.",Excluded
1485,"DNAJB6 is a peptide-binding chaperone which can suppress amyloid fibrillation of polyglutamine peptides at substoichiometric molar ratios Expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches lead to protein aggregation and severe neurodegenerative diseases. A highly efficient suppressor of polyQ aggregation was identified, the DNAJB6, when molecular chaperones from the HSPH, HSPA, and DNAJ families were screened for huntingtin exon 1 aggregation in cells (Hageman et al. in Mol Cell 37(3):355-369, 2010). Furthermore, also aggregation of polyQ peptides expressed in cells was recently found to be efficiently suppressed by co-expression of DNAJB6 (Gillis et al. in J Biol Chem 288:17225-17237, 2013). These suppression effects can be due to an indirect effect of DNAJB6 on other cellular components or to a direct interaction between DNAJB6 and polyQ peptides that may depend on other cellular components. Here, we have purified the DNAJB6 protein to investigate the suppression mechanism. The purified DNAJB6 protein formed large heterogeneous oligomers, in contrast to the more canonical family member DNAJB1 which is dimeric. Purified DNAJB6 protein, at substoichiometric molar ratios, efficiently suppressed fibrillation of polyQ peptides with 45degreeQ in a thioflavin T fibrillation. No suppression was obtained with DNAJB1, but with the closest homologue to DNAJB6, DNAJB8. The suppression effect was independent of HSPA1 and ATP. These data, based on purified proteins and controlled fibrillation in vitro, strongly suggest that the fibrillation suppression is due to a direct protein-protein interaction between the polyQ peptides and DNAJB6 and that the DNAJB6 has unique fibrillation suppression properties lacking in DNAJB1. Together, the data obtained in cells and in vitro support the view that DNAJB6 is a peptide-binding chaperone that can interact with polyQ peptides that are incompletely degraded by and released from the proteasome.",Excluded
1443,"The efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy for metastases from renal cell carcinoma Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for intracranial and extracranial metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma. The retrospective analysis of 85 patients (151 tumors) treated with SRT was performed. SRT was the sole treatment in 35% of tumors, the other 65% had received additional treatment such as surgery, palliative radiotherapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy. In 60% and 40% of patients SRT was delivered to brain and extracranial lesions, respectively. The assessment of the efficacy of SRT was based on a radiological imaging (Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and estimation of Local Control (LC) as well as Overall Survival (OS). Single fraction was used for 104 tumors and fractionated treatment for 47 tumors. The crude LC for evaluable lesions was 81%, stratified by tumor location: brain LC=94%, extracranial tumors LC=70% (p=0.049). The median OS was 9.4 months; 1-year and 2-year OS were 40% and 29%, respectively. The additional treatment did not lead to a better local response (p=0,543), but resulted in a benefit in OS (7 vs 13 months, p=0,01). A positive relationship between the biologically effective dose (BED) and local response was noted, but the BED was influenced by a tumor volume (R=-0,38; p<0,00001). The presence of multi-organ metastases reduced the OS rate (8.7 vs 19.1 months; p=0,01). The interval between the diagnosis of the metastasis and its treatment with SRT was inversely related to OS (P=0.0001). SRT results in a good local response, which is more beneficial for brain than extracranial lesions. The local efficacy of the SRT depends on the radiation dose. Multidisciplinary treatment and earlier application of SRT improves the prognosis of patients. Copyright © 2016, Cancer Research Institute Slovak Acad. of Sciences. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1707,"Bnct combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas INTRODUCTION: Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control. We have often treated RMGs using tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN, we herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT, and evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. METHOD(S): Two cohorts were included. The first and second cohorts were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, and between August 2017 and December 2017, respectively. They were followed by successive BV treatments. The first cohort was composed of 7 patients with RMGs (4 grade 4 and 3 grade 3 cases). The second cohort was composed of 6 patients with RMGs (5 grade 4 and 1 grade 3 cases). They were followed-up to April 2018. RESULT(S): Median OS and PFS after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively in the 1st cohort. Those in the second cohort were not reached. The OS data was compared with RPA classification for RMG as advocated by Carson et al. in a 2007 article in JCO. In both cohorts no symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred if BV could be continued.

Apomorphine is found to have no significant influence on the dopamine level in brain and striatum of non-irradiated rats, while L-DOPA and its combination with apomorphine raise this level. On the 72nd hour after irradiation with 900 R there is no essential change in the dopamine level in brain and the striatum; apomorphine raises the dopamine level in brain and striatum; the effect of L-DOPA and its combination with apomorphine is potentiated with respect to the increase of the dopamine level in brain and striatum.",Included

Photobiomodulation is effective for chronic diseases because of fewer side effects than drugs. Here we investigated the effects of photobiomodulation using light-emitting diode on amyloid plaques, gliosis, and neuronal loss to prevent and/or recover cognitive impairment, and optimal timing of photobiomodulation initiation for recovering cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. 5XFAD mice were used as an Alzheimer's disease model.

Both groups received photobiomodulation 20 minutes per session three times per week for 14 weeks. The Morris water maze, passive avoidance, and elevated plus maze tests were performed at 10 months of age. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed after behavioral evaluation. The results showed that photobiomodulation treatment at early stages reduced amyloid accumulation, neuronal loss, and microgliosis and alleviated the cognitive dysfunction in 5XFAD mice, possibly by increasing insulin degrading enzyme related to amyloid-beta degradation.

969,"Endovascular treatment of cerebrovascular disease Purpose of review: This review summarizes recent advances in endovascular therapy for cerebrovascular disease. Recent findings: For ruptured aneurysms, the only large, randomized, controlled trial comparing surgical and endovascular treatment (the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial) resulted in a significant reduction in death or dependency at 1 year, compared with surgery, providing sound evidence that coiling should be the treatment of first choice. Data from the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms demonstrated that treatment of unruptured anterior circulation aneurysms of under 7 mm with no history of subarachnoid hemorrhage is not justified. Embolization of arteriovenous malformations, as sole therapy, is curative only in a small percentage of cases, but can be part of a multimodal approach for reducing arteriovenous malformation size prior to surgery or radiotherapy. Partial treatment of complex arteriovenous malformations may be more dangerous than no treatment. Protection devices can reduce complication rates in carotid artery stenting, but scientific evidence is still lacking. Until the results of comparative trials are available, carotid artery stenting is indicated only in selected patients. Angioplasty and stenting of intracranial arterosclerotic disease is feasible but remains a high-risk procedure, indicated only in highly selected patients. In acute stroke therapy, new thrombolytics and clot-retrieval devices may result in better recanalization rates. Summary: Advances in endovascular therapy have occurred in all areas of cerebrovascular disease. To obtain maximal patient benefit, endovascular treatment should be performed as an interdisciplinary approach in high-volume centers. Importantly, long-term follow-up review is necessary to clarify the overall role of endovascular treatment in the management of cerebrovascular disease. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
3089,"Chronic pathophysiological changes in normal brain parenchyma raised after radiotherapy can accelerate the recurrence of glioma INTRODUCTION: Tumor recurrence is a leading cause of cancer mortality. Currently, the standard treatment for glioblastoma is maximal surgical resection and concomitant chemoradiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide therapy. However, this treatment offers a limited benefit, with a median progression-free survival of <7 months and a median overall survival of <15 months. Radiation-induced brain injury occurs in a normal brain following radiotherapy; it is described in terms of acute, early delayed and late delayed injury. The recurrence of glioblastoma usually occurs just around the same time as the early or late delayed phase of radiation injury. Our preliminary investigation has revealed that, at three months after X-ray irradiation, tumor-promoting miRNAs (Mir18a, Mir20a, Mir-92, Mir381, etc.) and cytokines (CCL2, CXCL10, SDF-1, Angpt2, etc.) are significantly up-regulated in the irradiated rat normal brain compared to the non-irradiated one. In the present study, therefore, we hypothesized that the pathophysiological changes in a normal brain parenchyma raised by radiotherapy may engage also in the tumor recurrence after the radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To explore above hypothesis, we transplanted rat glioblastoma cells (F98) into a rat brain to which X-ray had been irradiated in advance. Group 1: 60 Gy of X-ray was irradiated to right cerebral hemisphere. Group 2: 60 Gy of X-ray was irradiated to left cerebral hemisphere. Group 3: Sham irradiation was performed (control). 3 months after irradiation, 1x105 of F98 cells were stereotactically transplanted into the right cerebral hemisphere of each rat. RESULT(S): Rats in group 1 and 2 showed significantly shorter survival than rats in group 3 (p-value: 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). Interestingly, there was no significant difference of survival between group 1 and group 2 (p=0.8). Histopathological analysis for the tumors revealed that MIB-1 labeling index was significantly higher in group 1 and 2 than in group 3. CONCLUSION(S): It has been reported that, at the tumor recurrence, a lot of mutations including driver ones has been induced and accumulated through chemoradiotherapy, which can promote the tumor regrowth. However, the proliferation capacity of glioblastoma cells significantly increased, even when they were transplanted into the brain previously irradiated. Furthermore, the fact that tumor growth in the non-irradiated cerebral hemisphere of irradiated rats was also accelerated compared to the control group, suggested that some sort of biofactors may spread from irradiated normal brain cells and can make an impact on tumor cells existing in the opposite brain hemisphere. Thus, the delayed radiation injury in normal brain parenchyma might include paradoxical role on the tumor recurrence not only from inside but also from outside the irradiation field.",Included

Between March 2008 and August 2009, 10 patients were treated with SRT boost using CyberKnife system due mainly to unfavorable condition such as tumors in close proximity to serial organs or former radiotherapy fields. Treatment sites were the external auditory canal in two, the nasopharynx in one, the oropharynx in three, the nasal cavity in one, the maxillary sinus in two, and the oligometastatic cervical lymph node in one. All patients underwent preceding conventional radiotherapy of 40 to 60 Gy. Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose. Although a small volume high dose area within the normal structure could be observed in several patients, results of the present study showed potential benefits of the CyberKnife SRT boost.",Excluded

A 70-yr-old male with history of radiosurgery for AVM presented with aphasia and confusion. Preoperative angiography showed complete occlusion of the AVM. MRI showed multiple cystic lesions suspicious for radiation-induced necrosis and CM. IRB approval and patient consent was obtained. A pterional craniotomy was performed with transsylvian exposure of the insula. The radiated feeding arteries were followed to the occluded AVM nidus. A CM was noted deep to this candelabra of the MCA vessels, which were mobilized to access and resect the CM. A small incision was made in this insular cortex underneath the malformation circumferentially freeing it of adhesions. The sclerotic AVM nidus was circumferentially dissected and removed en bloc. Thorough exploration of the resection cavity revealed no residual CM or AVM nidus. Attention was then turned to the M2-MCA bifurcation aneurysm, which was occluded with a straight clip. Postoperative imaging confirmed complete CM resection. The patient recovered from his aphasia. This case demonstrates the management of a radiation-induced de novo CM following treatment of a high-grade AVM. Radiographic follow-up for radiosurgically treated AVM is needed to rule out long-term complications. Bleeding from a de novo CM mimics bleeding from residual AVM nidus, requiring careful angiographic evaluation. Copyright © 2019 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded
462,Retinal photoreceptor fine structure in the short-tailed stingray (Dasyatis brevicaudata) The fine structure of the retinal photoreceptors has been studied by light and electron microscopy in the short-tailed stingray (Dasyatis brevicaudata). The duplex retina of this elasmobranch contains rods and cones in a ratio of about 10:1. No multiple receptors were noted nor was a repeating or mosaic arrangement of the cones obvious. Only light-adapted specimens were studied but retinomotor movements of the photoreceptors were felt to be minimal or absent. The rods are large cylindrical cells with inner and outer segments of much the same diameter. Cones are short stout cells with a conical outer segment and a wider inner segment. Rod outer segment discs show peripheral incisures while cones do not. The inner segment of rods and cones are rich in organelles indicating much synthetic activity. The nuclei of rods and cones appear quite similar but cone nuclei are invariably at least partially protruded through the external limiting membrane which is formed by a series of zonulae adherentes between photoreceptor cells and Muller cells. The synaptic region of both rods and cones display both invaginated (ribbon) synapses and superficial (conventional) synapses.,Excluded
1860,"Morphological and functional identifications of catfish retinal neurons. I. Classical morphology The morphology of the catfish horizontal cells is comparable to that in other fish retinas. The external horizontal cells contact cone receptors and are stellate in shape; the intermediate horizontal cells are even more so and contact rod receptors. The internal horizontal cells constitute the most proximal layer of the inner nuclear layer and may possibly be, in reality, extended processes from the other two horizontal cell types. Bipolar cells resemble those in other teleost retinas: the size and shape of their dendritic tree encompass a continuous spectrum ranging from what is known as the small to the large bipolar cells. The accepted definition of amacrine cells is sufficiently vague to justify our originating a more descriptive and less inferential name for the (axonless) neurons in the inner nuclear layer which radiate processes throughout the inner synaptic layer. These starbust and spaghetti cells vary considerably in the character and extent of their dendritic spread, but correlates exist in other vertebrate retinas. Ganglion cells are found not only in the classical ganglion layer but displaced into the inner nuclear layer as well. Several types can be distinguished on the basis of cell geometry and by the properties of their dendritic tree. Not all of the categorization corresponds with previous descriptions; our findings suggest that some reorganization may be necessary in the accepted classification of cells in the proximal areas of the vertebrate retina. A subtle yet remarkable pattern underlies the entire structure of the catfish retina; there exists a definite gradient of size within a particular class of cells, and of configuration among the subclasses of a specific cell type. It remains to be seen if these morphological spectra bear any functional consequences. The fact that the structure of the catfish retina most closely resembles those of other phylogenetically ancient animals, such as the skate and the dogfish shark, testifies to its primitive organization; morphological and functional mechanisms discernible in this simple system may, therefore, be applicable to the retinas of higher ordered vertebrates.",Excluded
855,"The discovery and development of new potential antioxidant agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases Introduction: Several neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) including Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases have had associations with the oxidative process and free radical damage. Consequently, in past decades, several natural and synthetic antioxidants have been assessed as therapeutic agents but have shown limitations in bioavailability, metabolic susceptibility and permeability to the blood brain barrier. Given these issues, medicinal chemists are hard at work to modify/improve the chemical structures of these antioxidants, thereby improving their efficacy. Areas covered: In this review, the authors critically analyze several biological mechanisms involved in the generation of free radicals. Additionally, they analyze free radicals' role in the generation of oxidative stress and in the progression of many NDs. Further, the authors review a collection of natural and synthetic antioxidants, their role as free radical scavengers along with their mechanisms of action and their potential for preventing neurodegenerative diseases. Expert opinion: So far, preclinical studies on several antioxidants have shown promise for treating NDs, despite their limitations. The authors do highlight the lack of the adequate animal models for preclinical assessment and this does hinder further progression into clinical trials. Further studies are necessary to fully investigate the potential of these antioxidants as ND therapeutic options. © Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded
1951,"Metabolic correction of cerebral radiation syndrome DNA strand breaks that occur after irradiation activate the repair enzyme adenosine diphosphoribosyl transferase, which consumes NAD as a substrate and causes depletion first of neuronal NAD and then of the ATP pool. This is considered to be the crucial link in the mechanism underlying the cerebral radiation syndrome (CRS). In this study, two ways to correct the CRS metabolically were examined: (a) prevention of depletion of NAD after irradiation by administration of the enzyme inhibitor nicotinamide and (b) shunting the NAD-dependent oxidative phosphorylation pathway of ATP resynthesis by administration of a substrate of NAD-independent oxidation, succinate. Cerebral lesions induced by radiation were modeled by irradiation of rats or rat brain homogenates with 150 Gy of X rays. The manifestations of CRS in rats (excitement, convulsions, etc.) closely resembled those seen after acute hypoxia. In brain homogenates, pyruvate tetrazolium-reductase activity decreased after irradiation and could be corrected by addition of NAD after irradiation. Succinate tetrazolium-reductase activity was not affected by irradiation. Oxygen consumption by brain homogenates after irradiation in vitro and in situ decreased, as did oxygen consumption by rats in vivo after cranio-caudal irradiation. Administration of nicotinamide or succinate prevented both the postirradiation decrease in respiration (in both rats in vivo and brain homogenates in vitro) and the development of cerebral radiation syndrome. These results help to clarify the mechanisms underlying CRS and its metabolic correction.",Included
2670,"Radiation dose during coronary angiography: Correlation to body mass index Introduction: Coronary angiography (CAG) is a commonly performed procedure in cardiology, resulting in patients being exposed to radiation. Patients with high body mass index (BMI) are at increased risk of coronary artery disease. Catheter laboratory intensifiers use automatic exposure control (AEC) which adjusts radiation dose aiming to provide optimal quality images. Factors shown to be responsible for dose variability are complexity of the procedure, operator experience, their level of training in radiation protection, type and performance of x-ray equipment. The objective of present study was to evaluate if radiation dose received by patients correlated with BMI. Method(s): Retrospective data for 3678 CAG performed from Sep-07 to Mar-10 from a single centre, were analysed. Radiation dose was calculated as Dose Area Product (DAP) in mGym . Result(s): Mean radiation dose during the procedure was 4339 +/- 286 mGym . Mean BMI, contrast volume used and screening time were 29.22 +/- 0.08 kg/m2, 125 +/- 10.0 ml and 5.2 +/- 0.1 minutes respectively. BMI was positively correlated with increasing radiation dose during CAG (graph-1 &2). Patients with increased BMI did not require prolonged procedure or increased contrast volume. There was no significant inter-operator variability. Even Ten degree increase in angulation (oblique, cranial or caudal) increased radiation dose significantly. Conclusion(s): Patients with increased BMI receive a significantly higher radiation dose during CAG, affecting not only the patient, but every one present in the catheter laboratory. This has to be recognized by the operator when undertaking procedures in patients with a high BMI.",Excluded
51,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of sarcoma metastasis Purpose/Objective(s): The role of conventional radiation in the management of sarcoma metastasis to the spine is limited due to its radioresistant nature. However, spinal stereotactic radiosurgery (sSRS) may have a radiobiological advantage given the high dose per fraction. The purpose of this study is to report our experience using sSRS to treat patients with sarcoma metastasis to the spine. Materials/Methods: Thirty-four lesions (17 patients) with sarcoma metastatic to the spine were identified from a large IRB-approved database. Pain relief post-sSRS was prospectively collected using the Brief Pain Inventory. Survival was calculated from date of procedure using Kaplan- Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine the association between clinical factors and pain relief. Result(s): Eligible patients had a median age of 55 years and 56% were female. Median KPS was 85 (range, 60-100) and median clinical follow-up was 7 months (range, 0-58). Location of metastasis included 44% cervical/ thoracic, 35% lumbar, and 21% sacral lesions. Approximately, 12% had cord compression, 32% had epidural compression, and 59% had neural foramen involvement at the time of treatment. Reason for treatment included 53% for pain, 21% for pain and neurological deficits, 1 patient had vertebral compression fracture and the remaining 24% were asymptomatic. Target volume was a median of 71 cc (range, 16-428 cc). Median maximum prescription dose was 16 Gy (range, 14-16 Gy). In terms of prior treatment, 21% of patients had received prior cEBRT, 15% had prior SBRT, 29% had prior surgery, and 21% had received prior hardware. At 6 and 12 months, actuarial survival was 81% and 73%, radiographic control was 66% and 50%, and unadjusted pain control was 65% and 65%, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated that both radiographic failure and pain relief were associated with age, with older patients less likely to have radiographic failure (HR = 0.864, p = 0.0004) and pain relief (HR = 0.929, p = 0.0202). Unadjusted symptom failure was associated with a larger target volume (HR = 1.010, p = 0.0142), prior surgery (HR = 7.353, p = 0.0131), and prior hardware (HR = 4.717, p = 0.0244). Conclusion(s): We report an unadjusted pain control in 65% of sarcoma patients with spinal metastasis. Based on our previously published data and due to the comparatively lower radiographic and pain control rates when compared to other histologies, we recommend increasing the dose beyond 16 Gy for sarcomas.",Excluded
2262,"Targeted sequencing and intracranial outcomes of patients with lung adenocarcinoma brain metastases treated with radiotherapy BACKGROUND: Treatment for advanced lung adenocarcinoma (AC) has become increasingly personalized based on molecular results. However, for patients with AC brain metastases (BMs), intracranial outcomes based on molecular subtype and the frequency of molecular aberrations are less well defined. This study sought to report targeted next-generation sequencing results and investigate molecularly based outcomes for patients with AC-BMs treated with radiotherapy.METHODS: The records of 132 patients with AC-BMs treated at Emory University from September 2008 to August 2016 with successful next-generation sequencing were reviewed. Rates of local disease recurrence, distant brain failure (DBF), and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were estimated using cumulative incidence with competing risk analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.RESULTS: The most common aberrations included tumor protein 53 (TP53) (60%), KRAS (29%), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (20.5%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss (15.5%), and MET amplification (13%). The majority of patients (62%) were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery alone. In these patients, KRAS mutation, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, and having >= 6 BMs were associated with an increased risk of salvage WBRT (P < .05). KRAS mutation remained significant for an increased risk of salvage WBRT when compared with EGFR/ALK/KRAS-negative patients (hazard ratio, 5.17; P < .05), despite a similar risk of DBF. PTEN loss was associated with increased risk of DBF (P < .05), whereas EGFR and ALK aberrations were associated with a decreased risk of local disease recurrence (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study quantified the frequency of genetic aberrations in patients with AC-BMs and demonstrated their association with intracranial outcomes. In particular, a cohort of patients with KRAS mutations and >=6 BMs were identified to be at high risk of requiring salvage WBRT after undergoing upfront stereotactic radiosurgery.",Excluded

The optimal regimen remains unclear. We seek to investigate the clinical outcome and toxicities of SABR for central located stage I or isolated recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials/Methods: One hundred one patients with 101 central lesions, defined as being located within 2 cm of the bronchial tree, major vessels, esophagus, heart, tracheal, pericardium, mediastinal pleural and brachial plexus and vertebral body, but having no direct invasion, Stage I (n = 82), and isolated recurrent (n = 19) NSCLC, were treated with image-guided SABR to 50 Gy in four fractions or 70 Gy in ten fractions. Toxicity was scored according to the CTCAE V3.0. Result(s): With a median follow-up period of 27.5 months (range, 9.0-81.8 months), the local control rates were 98.0%, 96.1% at 2 years and 3 years respectively. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 71.0% and 57.5%, respectively. Although the most common side effect was radiation pneumonitis (RP), there was no G4 or G5 RP with current dose volume constraints (40 Gy <1 cc for the bronchial tree). A total of 18.8% had G2 RP and 2.0% had G3 RP. Dosimetric factors V5- V20, mean lung dose (MLD) of ipsilateral lung were associated with RP on univariate analysis. Three percent developed radiation brachial plexus neuropathy; the maximum brachial plexus doses of these patients were 38- 43 Gy in 4 fractions. One patient, with tumor invading hilum who was treated with SABR 70 Gy in 10 fx to PTV, died from hemoptysis one year later. Analysis showed that significant portions of pulmonary vessels received doses of 70 to 80 GY. Conclusion(s): SABR for central lung tumors resulted in high local control and acceptable toxicity when appropriate dose volume constraints were applied. Keeping brachial tree/pulmonary vessel dose 40 Gy <1 cc in 4 fractions appears safe in avoiding G4 or 5 RP. Maximal dose >38 Gy in 4 fractions to the brachial plexus was associated with neuropathy. Severe toxicity could develop if large portions of the major vessel are exposed to 70 Gy or higher even in 10 fractions.",Excluded

1530,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD.",Excluded
3528,"Quantification of arterial, venous, and cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics by magnetic resonance imaging under simulated micro-gravity conditions: a prospective cohort study BACKGROUND: Astronauts undergoing long-duration spaceflight are exposed to numerous health risks, including Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS), a spectrum of ophthalmic changes that can result in permanent loss of visual acuity. The etiology of SANS is not well understood but is thought to involve changes in cerebrovascular flow dynamics in response to microgravity. There is a paucity of knowledge in this area; in particular, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics have not been well characterized under microgravity conditions. Our study was designed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity (head-down tilt [HDT]) on cerebrovascular flow dynamics. We hypothesized that microgravity conditions simulated by acute HDT would result in increases in CSF pulsatile flow.METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, we measured flow in major cerebral arteries, veins, and CSF spaces in fifteen healthy volunteers using phase contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) before and during 15degree HDT.RESULTS: We found a decrease in all CSF flow variables [systolic peak flow (p = 0.009), and peak-to-peak pulse amplitude (p = 0.001)]. Cerebral arterial average flow (p = 0.04), systolic peak flow (p = 0.04), and peak-to-peak pulse amplitude (p = 0.02) all also significantly decreased. We additionally found a decrease in average cerebral arterial flow (p = 0.040). Finally, a significant increase in cerebral venous cross-sectional area under HDT (p = 0.005) was also observed.CONCLUSIONS: These results collectively demonstrate that acute application of -15degree HDT caused a reduction in CSF flow variables (systolic peak flow and peak-to-peak pulse amplitude) which, when coupled with a decrease in average cerebral arterial flow, systolic peak flow, and peak-to-peak pulse amplitude, is consistent with a decrease in cardiac-related pulsatile CSF flow. These results suggest that decreases in cerebral arterial inflow were the principal drivers of decreases in CSF pulsatile flow.",Excluded
2760,"Achieving sub cm CTV-PTV margin in pelvic treatments: Radiographers learning curve Aims: Image guidance is not always feasible or available for standard/ conformal treatments and so, offline portal image measurements help define population based CTV-PTV margins. Reproducibility in pelvis is aided by the use of ankle- and/or knee-indexed supports available in standard sizes generally suiting the needs of taller western patients. Radiographers need to be convinced of the importance for use of one/more positional devices as this adds to setup effort and time. Different permutations of aligning the pelvis and positional aids, resident supervised or not are reported for patients treated for cancer of the cervix/endometrium. Method(s): Patients were aligned using lasers/field lights to either anterior field center (conventional alignment) or to mid line tattoo over mons pubis keeping constant 10 cm table top to vertical height for all setups using either standard ankle or knee plus ankle positioning device. Localization CT scanbased digitally reconstructed radiographs were used as reference to compare with portal imaging acquired generally in pattern of 3 in 1st week and weekly thereafter. The van Herk formula was used to compute CTV-PTV margin from anterior and lateral image projections to give mediolateral (ML), cranio-caudal (CC) and antero-posterior (AP) margins. Result(s): The initial pelvic alignment were done in the presence of a resident doctor using ankle positioning by two different alignment methods: conventional and setup (4 cm cranial offset from reference tattoo at mons pubis). The corresponding PTV margin in ML direction was 1.6 cm versus 0.9 cm, CC 1.2 cm versus 1.1 cm respectively and in AP was identical at 0.7 cm. Subsequently, with radiographers by themselves, PTV margins were 1.1 cm versus 0.9 cm for ML, 1.1 cm versus 1.5 cm, CC and 1.0 cm versus 0.9 cm in AP direction for conventional and setup alignment respectively. An increase in CC margin was seen for setup arm. The radiographers were given feedback and setup reproducibility was assessed for next 13 patients treated with a similar setup protocol. The PTV margins for this group in CC showed improvement to 1.1 cm, ML was 0.9 cm and 0.9 cm in AP directions. A knee-positioning device was introduced with ankle for patient alignment with setup protocol. An increase in PTV margin to 1.4 cm was calculated for ML with modest decrease in CC at 0.8 cm and 0.9 cm for AP direction with use of two devices. The standard knee device was abandoned as use of two devices was perceived as cumbersome and unsuitable in height for patients. A third technique of alignment keeping treatment center at tattooed reference plane (mons pubis) using ankle device was studied. The PTV margins for ML, CC, AP directions were within a cm-0.8 cm, 0.9 cm, 0.9 cm respectively which is now the current practice. Conclusion(s): There is a radiographer learning curve.

The patient's perspective Newer treatments for head and neck cancers, including altered fractionation and the use of concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, may provide better local-regional tumor control rates; however, patients may experience more frequent and more severe acute toxicities that result in considerable suffering. Through this study, we sought a better understanding of patients' experiences when undergoing radiotherapy. Personal interviews were conducted with 33 individuals who had received radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. These individuals described their treatment experiences and identified the most troublesome and debilitating side effects of radiotherapy. Overall, lethargy and weakness, dry mouth, mouth sores and pain, taste changes, and sore throat were the most frequently reported troublesome or debilitating side effects. The single most debilitating side effect was oropharyngeal mucositis that was characterized by patients as sore throat, and mouth sores and pain; both negatively affected the patient's ability to eat and drink, causing many patients to experience significant weight loss. Trends toward more aggressive management of head and neck cancers underscore the need for new and effective therapies for oropharyngeal mucositis occurring in patients receiving radiotherapy.",Excluded

1350,"Adjuvant treatment of brain metastases With an incidence of 15/10<sup>5</sup> in the general population, brain metastases constitute a serious, debilitating complication in cancer patients. The majority of those patients suffer from more than one metastasis, but up to 30% to 40% present with a solitary lesion. Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) extends median survival from 1 to 2 months for treatment with steroids only, to 4 to 6 months in most series. However, long-term survival (>1-2 years) is observed in up to 10% of patients with favorable prognostic factors, such as solitary lesions, good Karnofsky performance status, and absence of extracranial disease. For those patients, individually optimized treatment is worthwhile. For good-prognosis patients with controlled extracranial disease, surgery in combination with postoperative WBRT should be considered, especially when fast relief of symptoms is mandated. For surgically inaccessible solitary lesions below a size threshold of approximately 30 ccm, stereotactic radiosurgery (RS), although never compared to surgery in a randomized fashion, seems to yield comparable results and is the treatment of choice for more than one lesion in appropriately selected patients. Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning the optimal treatment regimens for brain metastases remain. These mainly concern the radiation dose, need for a combination of RS and WBRT, relative timing of different treatment modalities, and maximum number of brain metastases that can reasonably be treated with RS when long-term progression-free survival is the goal. However, RS is definitely an excellent option for salvage and palliation in patients with short life expectancy, as it is simultaneously noninvasive and cost-effective, with short hospitalization times. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

Here we describe a method-influence mapping-that uses single-neuron perturbations to directly measure how cortical neurons reshape sensory representations. In layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1), we use two-photon optogenetics to trigger action potentials in a targeted neuron and calcium imaging to measure the effect on spiking in neighbouring neurons in awake mice viewing visual stimuli. Excitatory neurons on average suppressed other neurons and had a centre-surround influence profile over anatomical space. A neuron's influence on its neighbour depended on their similarity in activity. Notably, neurons suppressed activity in similarly tuned neurons more than in dissimilarly tuned neurons. In addition, photostimulation reduced the population response, specifically to the targeted neuron's preferred stimulus, by around 2%. Therefore, V1 layer 2/3 performed feature competition, in which a like-suppresses-like motif reduces redundancy in population activity and may assist with inference of the features that underlie sensory input. We anticipate that influence mapping can be extended to investigate computations in other neural populations.",Excluded

To test this hypotheses we have studied the influence of the thiamine and folate deficiency and low dose irradiation and their combination on the voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. 80 adult male rats waiting 140-180 g. were preliminary tested in the conditions of free choice between 10% ethanol and water (triple, during 2 days). Then they were divided into 4 groups (on 20 animals) equal on the alcohol consumption and preference. 2 weeks later they were treated by hidrochythiamine (vitamin B1 antagonist, 1 mg/kg, s.c.) and metotrexate (folic acid antagonist, 200 mg/kg, s.c.) weekly, three times. 2 days following the every administration the some animals were treated by the gamma-irradiation (Co60, 0.25 gray). The groups were: 1- control (isotonic solution of NaCl); 2- irradiation alone; 3- antivitamins; 4- antivitamins + irradiations. Next day following the last irradiation half of animals from every group were sacrificed and vitamins status in their tissues was studied. Others were tested during 14 days individually in situation of free choice between 10% ethanol solution and water. In groups 2-4 the decreased transketolase activity (marker thiamine-dependent enzyme) and thiamine diphosphate level in blood, liver and brain as well as signs of folic deficiency were found. In groups 3 and 4 the alcohol preference index on the first week of post-irradiation testing period increased on 40.8 and 112.7% (p<0.05); on the second week on 19,1 and 81.4% (P <0.05) accordingly. In conclusion, the combination of low dose irradiation and B-vitamins deficiency increases the alcohol preference and consumption in rats. Those factors may be one of the reason of alcohol addiction also in population of Chernobyl region.",Included
3127,"Early changes in the integrative systems of the brain in rats during the combined action of ethanol and gamma-irradiation. [Russian] A study was made of Wistar male rats with the body mass of 250-270 g using neurohistological, electron microscopic and biochemical methods. The animals' heads were irradiated with gamma-quanta at a dose of 50 Gy, the rate of 6.7 cGy/s. Two minutes before or right after irradiation 15% ethanol solution (0.28 and 2.25 g/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. It was established that changes of interneuronal contacts in gamma-irradiation of the head were similar in nature to those caused by ethanol (2.25 g/kg). The effects of combined action of the above factors depended on the succession of exposure and a dose of ethanol. Slightly more noticeable synaptic changes, probably associated with mitochondrion affection and hyperhydration, were noted in ethanol administration (2.25 g/kg) after irradiation of the head.",Included
2658,"Benefits of Early Palliative Care in the Community: A Propensity Score Matched Cancer Cohort Objective: Randomized trials of early palliative care (PC) showed patient benefits. However these benefits have not been validated in community-based cohorts. The objective is to assess the impact of early vs not-early PC among cancer decedents on the risk of receiving aggressive care (ED/hospitalization), supportive care (home care/physician home visit), or hospital death. Method(s): We took a retrospective cohort of Ontario decedents between 2004 and 2014. We identified those who were 'early' PC users (i.e. used a validated PC service between month 12-6 before death [exposure]). We used propensity score matching to identify a control group of 'not-early' PC users. We hard matched on age, sex, cancer type and stage. The propensity score included region, income, year, radiation, etc. Among those with InterRAI assessments in exposure period, we additionally controlled for health instability, and dependency, depression, cognitive performance, pain, and caregiver presence via propensity score. McNemar test used to examine differences between pairs. Result(s): 51,001 decedents received early PC vs 85,979 not-early PC (i.e. late or none). After matching among those with no interRAI assessments, we found 34,184 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal distributions of age, sex, cancer type (e.g. 25% lung cancer) and stage (e.g. 24% stage 3 or 4). Compared to not-early PC users, early PC users had a 10% lower absolute risk to die in hospital and have any aggressive care respectively and a 24% higher absolute risk to any receive supportive care. In a mutually exclusive cohort, matching among those with interRAI assessments, we identified 3,419 pairs of early and not-early PC users. Both groups had equal scores in health instability (e.g. 12% moderate-high CHESS score) and other interRAI scales. The outcome results were similar to the non-interRAI analysis. Conclusion(s): Using propensity score matching, decedents receiving early PC are likely to receive more supportive care and less aggressive care compared to not-early PC users. Our study uniquely focuses on a population receiving community palliative care. In a distinct sample using interRAI assessments, we control for several confounders previously unmeasured.

PAsAG protected plasmid DNA from gamma-radiation induced damages under in vitro conditions. Presence of 1.6 mM PAsAG inhibited the disappearance of ccc (covalently closed circular) form of plasmid pBR322 with a dose modifying factor of 1.5. Comet assay studies on mouse spleen cells exposed to 6 Gy gamma-radiation (ex vivo) in presence and absence of PAsAG revealed that cellular DNA was effectively protected by this compound from radiation induced damages. Oral administration of 80 mg/kg body weight of PAsAG to mice 1 hour prior to 6 Gy whole body gamma-radiation exposure, efficiently protected cellular DNA in tissues such as spleen, bone marrow and blood, from radiation induced damages as indicated by alkaline comet assay. Oxidative stress in tissues such as liver and brain of mice, following whole body exposure to various doses of gamma-radiation (2-8 Gy), monitored as levels of GSH and peroxidation of lipids, were found considerably reduced when PAsAG was orally administered (80 mg/kg body weight) to the mice one hour prior to the radiation exposure. PAsAG administration improved the per cent survival of mice following exposure to 10 Gy whole body gamma-radiation. Thus PAsAG could act as a radioprotector under in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo conditions of ionizing-radiation exposure.",Included
2951,"Lifetime risk of stroke and impact of hypertension: estimates from the adult health study in Hiroshima and Nagasaki Very few reports have been published on lifetime risk (LTR) of stroke by blood pressure (BP) group. This study included participants in the Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study who have been followed up by biennial health examinations since 1958. We calculated the LTR of stroke for various BP-based groups among 7847 subjects who had not been diagnosed with stroke before the index age of 55 years using cumulative incidence analysis adjusting for competing risks. By 2003, 868 subjects had suffered stroke (512 (58.9%) were women and 542 (62.4%) experienced ischemic stroke). BP was a significant factor in determining risk of stroke for men and women, with distributions of cumulative risk for stroke significantly different across BP groups. The LTR of all-stroke for normotension (systolic BP/diastolic BP < 120/80 mm Hg), prehypertension (120-139/80-89 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (140-159/90-99 mm Hg) and stage 2 hypertension (> 160/100 mm Hg) were 13.8-16.9-25.8-25.8% in men and 16.0-19.9-24.0-30.5% in women, respectively (P < 0.001 among BP groups in both sexes). The estimates did not differ significantly (P = 0.16) between normotensive and prehypertensive subjects.

120,"An optical marker based on the UV-induced green-to-red photoconversion of a fluorescent protein We have cloned a gene encoding a fluorescent protein from a stony coral, Trachyphyllia geoffroyi, which emits green, yellow, and red light. The protein, named Kaede, includes a tripeptide, His-Tyr-Gly, that acts as a green chromophore that can be converted to red. The red fluorescence is comparable in intensity to the green and is stable under usual aerobic conditions. We found that the green-red conversion is highly sensitive to irradiation with UV or violet light (350-400 nm), which excites the protonated form of the chromophore. The excitation lights used to elicit red and green fluorescence do not induce photoconversion. Under a conventional epifluorescence microscope, Kaede protein expressed in HeLa cells turned red in a graded fashion in response to UV illumination; maximal illumination resulted in a 2,000-fold increase in the ratio of red-to-green signal. These color-changing properties provide a simple and powerful technique for regional optical marking. A focused UV pulse creates an instantaneous plane source of red Kaede within the cytosol. The red spot spreads rapidly throughout the cytosol, indicating its free diffusibility in the compartment. The extensive diffusion allows us to delineate a single neuron in a dense culture, where processes originating from many different somata are present. Illumination of a focused UV pulse onto the soma of a Kaede-expressing neuron resulted in filling of all processes with red fluorescence, allowing visualization of contact sites between the red and green neurons of interest.",Excluded
2598,Effects of prenatal ionizing irradiation on the development of the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina Prenatal exposure to ionizing irradiation has been shown to be an effective method to eliminate selectively certain neuronal population. This investigation studied the effects on the ganglion cell layer of the retinae of adult mice exposed to a gamma source (total dose = 3 Gy) at 16 days gestation. There was a significant reduction in the total number of neurons (displaced amacrine + ganglion cells) in the ganglion cell layer (33%) that was mainly caused by a pronounced loss (59%) of displaced amacrine cells. The diameters of the surviving retinal ganglion cells were consistently larger than those of the controls. Prenatal irradiation is the first experimental approach that partially eliminates displaced amacrine cells. It is suggested that the morphogenesis of retinal ganglion cells may be affected by displaced amacrine cells. © 2001 ISDN.,Excluded

1338,"Monitoring the upper tracts in neurogenic bladder dysfunction Altered bladder physiology as a result of neuromuscular disease may exert a profound influence on upper urinary tract function. Upper urinary tract abnormalities may occur in these patients in the absence of symptomatology and a systematic program of long-term surveillance is required. Monitoring the upper urinary tract to detect abnormalities that would require an alteration in bladder management is likely one of the key factors that has resulted in the decreased morbidity and mortality in neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Excretory urography, comprehensive renal scintillation procedures, and renal ultrasound examinations all have played a role in monitoring upper urinary tract dysfunction. Cystourethrography has been utilized to detect vesicoureteral reflux. Comprehensive renal scintillation procedures have some distinct advantages over excretory urography, including lack of adverse reactions, lack of need for bowel preparation and dehydration, and lower radiation exposure. These factors have improved patient compliance in returning for follow-up examinations. The sensitivity of the comprehensive renal scintillation procedure has allowed it to replace the excretory urogram, the cystourethrogram, and serum creatinine as monitors of upper urinary tract function at our institution. Renal ultrasound examinations have been utilized recently by some investigators and results compare favorably with excretory urography. We are currently evaluating the renal ultrasound examination against the comprehensive renal scintillation procedure and excretory urography to determine its future role for upper urinary tract screening in neurogenic bladder dysfunction.",Excluded

Exposure to these particles can affect the ability of rats to perform a variety of tasks, indicating that there is the possibility that the performance capabilities of astronauts may be affected. Previous research has shown that diets containing blueberry or strawberry extract can ameliorate the deficits produced by irradiation using a ground-based analog for exposure to cosmic rays. Rats were placed on diets containing 2% blueberry or strawberry extract for 2 months prior to exposure to 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe particles. There were no effects on performance of any group of animals when tested on an ascending fixed-ratio operant task 6 months following exposure. When tested 12 months after exposure, the performance of the radiated animals given blueberry extract did not differ from the radiated animals fed the control diet. Both groups performed significantly poorer than the non-irradiated controls. There were no differences between the non-irradiated animals fed control diet and the radiated animals fed the strawberry diet and their performance was significantly better than of the radiated rats fed the blueberry or control diets. The results indicate that diets containing strawberry extract may provide a significant level of radiation protection on exploratory class missions.",Included

OBJECTIVES: Many neurosurgeons obtain repeat head CT at the first clinic follow-up visit for nonoperative cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH). The authors undertook a single-center, retrospective study to determine whether outpatient CT altered clinical decision-making.METHODS: The authors evaluated 173 consecutive adult patients admitted to their institution from April 2006 to August 2012 with an admission diagnosis of cerebral contusion or tSAH and at least 1 clinic follow-up visit with CT. Patients with epidural, subdural, aneurysmal subarachnoid, or intraventricular hemorrhage, and those who underwent craniotomy, were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed for new CT findings, new patient symptoms, and changes in treatment plan. Patients were stratified by neurological symptoms into 3 groups: 1) asymptomatic; 2) mild, nonspecific symptoms; and 3) significant symptoms. Mild, nonspecific symptoms included minor headaches, vertigo, fatigue, and mild difficulties with concentration, short-term memory, or sleep; significant symptoms included moderate to severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, focal neurological complaints, impaired consciousness, or new cognitive impairment evident on routine clinical examination.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients met inclusion criteria, with initial clinic follow-up obtained within approximately 6 weeks. Of the 173 patients, 104 (60.1%) were asymptomatic, 68 patients (39.3%) had mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, and 1 patient (1.0%) had significant neurological symptoms. Of the asymptomatic patients, 3 patients (2.9%) had new CT findings and 1 of these patients (1.0%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings. This change involved an additional clinic appointment and CT to monitor a 12-mm chronic subdural hematoma that ultimately resolved without treatment. Of the patients with mild, nonspecific neurological symptoms, 6 patients (8.8%) had new CT findings and 3 of these patients (4.4%) underwent a change in treatment plan because of these findings; none of these patients required surgical intervention. The single patient with significant neurological symptoms did not have any new CT findings.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat outpatient CT of asymptomatic patients after nonoperative cerebral contusion and tSAH is very unlikely to demonstrate significant new pathology. Given the cost and radiation exposure associated with CT, imaging should be reserved for patients with significant symptoms or focal findings on neurological examination.",Excluded

Method(s): Sixteen patients underwent fractionated proton therapy (PT) receiving dose to the healthy tissue because of direct or indirect (base skull tumors) irradiation. MWI was performed by a multi-echo sequence with 32 equally spaced echoes (10-320 ms). Decay data were processed to identify 3 T<inf>2</inf> compartments: myelin water (Mw) below 40 ms, intra-extracellular water (IEw) between 40 and 250 ms, and free water (CSFw) above 250 ms. Both MWI and DTI scans were acquired pre (pre)-treatment and immediately at the end (end) of PT. After image registration, voxel-wise difference maps, obtained by subtracting MWI and DTI pre from those acquired at the end of PT, were compared with the corresponding biological equivalent dose (BED). Result(s): Mw difference showed a positive correlation and IEw difference showed a negative correlation with BED considering end-pre changes (P <.01). The changes in CSFw were not significantly correlated with the delivered BED. The changes in DTI data, considering end-pre acquisitions, showed a positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and the delivered BED.

1857,"A strategy for the use of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) on linear accelerators and its impact on treatment margins for prostate cancer patients Background and Purpose: In external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer, the consideration of various systematic error types leads to wide treatment margins compromising normal tissue tolerance. We investigated if systematic set-up errors can be reduced by a set of initial image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) sessions. Patients and Methods: 27 patients received daily IGRT resulting in a set of 882 cone-beam computed tomographies (CBCTs). After matching to bony structures, we analyzed the dimensions of remaining systematic errors from zero up to six initial IGRT sessions and aimed at a restriction of daily IGRT for 10% of all patients. For threshold definition, we determined the standard deviations (SD) of the shift corrections and selected patients out of this range for daily image guidance. To calculate total treatment margins, we demanded for a cumulative clinical target volume (CTV) coverage of at least 95% of the specified dose in 90% of all patients. Result(s): The gain of accuracy was largest during the first three IGRTs. In order to match precision and workload criteria, thresholds for the SD of the corrections of 3.5 mm, 2.0 mm and 4.5 mm in the left-right (L-R), cranial-caudal (C-C), and anterior-posterior (A-P) direction, respectively, were identified. Including all other error types, the total margins added to the CTV amounted to 8.6 mm in L-R, 10.4 mm in C-C, and 14.4 mm in A-P direction. Conclusion(s): Only initially performed IGRT might be helpful for eliminating gross systematic errors especially after virtual simulation. However, even with daily IGRT performance, a substantial PTV margin reduction is only achievable by matching internal markers instead of bony anatomical structures. © 2008 Urban & Vogel.",Excluded
3492,"Effects of serotonergic agonists on firing rates of photically responsive cells in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus Serotonergic neurons from the midbrain raphe nuclei innervate the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which functions as the dominant pacemaker for mammalian circadian rhythms. We investigated the effects of serotonin (5-HT) on firing rates of light-activated SCN cells in urethane-anesthetized hamsters. Micro-iontophoretic application of 5-HT or 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT and 5-CT) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous activity and photic responses in the majority of SCN cells tested. Application of metergoline alone, a non-selective 5-HT antagonist, slightly increased firing rates during darkness and light exposure, suggesting a tonic serotonergic suppression of SCN activity. Metergoline also effectively attenuated suppression induced by the three 5-HT agonists. In addition, the effects of 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by a 5-HT1A antagonist, SDZ 216-525. However, other putative 5-HT antagonists were weak (propranolol and NAN-190) or ineffective (ketanserin) in blocking the action of 8-OH-DPAT.

In PD, though, subthalamic-nuclei deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective-restorative-therapeutic option for enhancing motor, freezing-of-gait (FoG) and other axial-symptoms, albeit, its impact on gait-disturbances is hazy. Studies [1] suggest that low frequencies can augment gait-parameters provided frequency-parameters (including stimulation-intensity and pulse-width) are changed. Materials/Methods: 40Parkinson's post STN-DBS patients with gaitdisturbances were included in the study. All patients were on constant neurostimulation-parameters and dopaminergic-medication for a month prior to assessment. Gait-parameters were analyzed during-medication 'on' and DBS 'on' state, at 4 classes-of-frequencies 180Hz,130Hz,90Hz, and at 60Hz and DBS 'off' medication 'on' state. Gait was analyzed using stand-walk-sit (SWS) test and freezing-of-gait (FoG) scales. Total elapsed-times, number of steps/freezing episodes were analyzed in SWS test. Effect of dual-tasking on gait was analyzed using FoG score. While analyzing-parameters at differentfrequencies, Wilcoxon signed rank-test was employed. Result(s): 40Parkinson's on neuromodulation were studied, out of which 29 were male. Average mean-age was 55.45+10.76 years. Mean-duration of disease at the onset was 13.13+6.41 years. Post-surgery mean-duration was 3.58+2.4 years. 38Parkinson's showed significant-improvement in gait at a single-frequency, which was singular for each patient while 2patients showed optimal-response at two frequencies. In SWS-test, 17patients (42.5%) had good-response at 180Hz, 6(15%) at 130Hz,14(46.7%) at 90Hz,5 (12.5%) at 60Hz. [Table 1] Total FoG-scores and sub-scores based on dualtask also improved at similar frequencies. Discussion(s): Statistically-significant-improvement in all gait-parameters including dual-tasking at best-frequency in comparison to DBS 'off' and 130Hz, with chi2= 9.2857 with 2 degree-of-freedom, highly-significant at 5% (<0.0001).

2286,"The homeobox transcription factor Even-skipped regulates acquisition of electrical properties in Drosophila neurons BACKGROUND: While developmental processes such as axon pathfinding and synapse formation have been characterized in detail, comparatively less is known of the intrinsic developmental mechanisms that regulate transcription of ion channel genes in embryonic neurons. Early decisions, including motoneuron axon targeting, are orchestrated by a cohort of transcription factors that act together in a combinatorial manner. These transcription factors include Even-skipped (Eve), islet and Lim3. The perdurance of these factors in late embryonic neurons is, however, indicative that they might also regulate additional aspects of neuron development, including the acquisition of electrical properties.RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that a combinatorial code transcription factor is also able to influence the acquisition of electrical properties in embryonic neurons we utilized the molecular genetics of Drosophila to manipulate the expression of Eve in identified motoneurons. We show that increasing expression of this transcription factor, in two Eve-positive motoneurons (aCC and RP2), is indeed sufficient to affect the electrical properties of these neurons in early first instar larvae. Specifically, we observed a decrease in both the fast K+ conductance (IKfast) and amplitude of quantal cholinergic synaptic input. We used charybdotoxin to pharmacologically separate the individual components of IKfast to show that increased Eve specifically down regulates the Slowpoke (a BK Ca2+-gated potassium channel), but not Shal, component of this current. Identification of target genes for Eve, using DNA adenine methyltransferase identification, revealed strong binding sites in slowpoke and nAcRalpha-96Aa (a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit). Verification using real-time PCR shows that pan-neuronal expression of eve is sufficient to repress transcripts for both slo and nAcRalpha-96Aa.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that Eve is sufficient to regulate both voltage- and ligand-gated currents in motoneurons, extending its known repertoire of action beyond its already characterized role in axon guidance. Our data are also consistent with a common developmental program that utilizes a defined set of transcription factors to determine both morphological and functional neuronal properties.",Excluded
1134,"Endovascular treatment for carotid artery stenosis after neck irradiation BACKGROUND: To lower the risk of complications, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been proposed as an alternative to open surgery for carotid artery stenosis after neck irradiation. However, there are little postoperative data to support the benefits of this strategy. This study evaluated the outcome of CAS in patients who had undergone neck irradiation.METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at 15 vascular surgery or interventional radiology centers in France between January 1998 and July 2006. A total of 135 patients (115 men) with a mean age of 67 +/- 8 years (range, 43-88) underwent CAS for 149 irradiation-induced lesions. The interval between irradiation and discovery of the lesions was 12 +/- 8 years. Mean diameter reduction was 81% (range, 50%-95%), and stenosis was symptomatic in 34%. Contralateral carotid lesions were observed in 48% of patients, including thrombosis in 18 and stenosis >50% in 53.RESULTS: Technical failure occurred during CAS in three cases. The overall technical success rate was 98%. A cerebral protection device was used in 59%. No death, one transient ischemic attack, and two strokes occurred during the first postoperative month. Mean follow-up was 30 months. Six patients were lost to follow-up. Survival rates were 93.9% at 1 year and 75.3% at 3 years. Complications after the first postoperative month included neurologic events in six, carotid thrombosis in nine, and restenosis in 18. The rates of freedom from neurologic and anatomic events were, respectively, 96.2% and 93.2% at 1 year and 93.1% and 85.9% at 3 years.CONCLUSION: The immediate outcome of CAS for irradiation-induced carotid artery stenosis was satisfactory. Medium-term neurologic outcome was acceptable, but the incidence of anatomic events such as thrombosis and restenosis was high. A randomized study is needed to confirm that the outcome of the endovascular and surgical therapy is comparable in this indication.",Excluded

Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a dose of 0, 1.5, 3.0 or 4.0 Gy of 250 MeV protons at Loma Linda University and were tested in the different behavioral tests at various times following exposure. Results showed that there was no effect of proton irradiation at any dose on any of the endpoints measured. Therefore, there is a contrast between the insignificant effects of high dose proton exposure and the dramatic effectiveness of low dose (<0.1 Gy) exposures to 56Fe particles on both neurochemical and behavioral endpoints.",Included

1215,"Quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow velocity and intracellular motility using dynamic light scattering-optical coherence tomography This paper describes a novel optical method for label-free quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracellular motility (IM) in the rodent cerebral cortex. This method is based on a technique that integrates dynamic light scattering (DLS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), named DLS-OCT. The technique measures both the axial and transverse velocities of CBF, whereas conventional Doppler OCT measures only the axial one. In addition, the technique produces a three-dimensional map of the diffusion coefficient quantifying nontranslational motions. In the DLS-OCT diffusion map, we observed high-diffusion spots, whose locations highly correspond to neuronal cell bodies and whose diffusion coefficient agreed with that of the motion of intracellular organelles reported in vitro in the literature. Therefore, the present method has enabled, for the first time to our knowledge, label-free imaging of the diffusion-like motion of intracellular organelles in vivo. As an example application, we used the method to monitor CBF and IM during a brief ischemic stroke, where we observed an induced persistent reduction in IM despite the recovery of CBF after stroke. This result supports that the IM measured in this study represent the cellular energy metabolism-related active motion of intracellular organelles rather than free diffusion of intracellular macromolecules.",Excluded

Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party In patients with non-metastatic but inoperable non-small cell lung cancer that is locally too extensive for radical radiotherapy (RT), but who have good performance status, it is important to determine whether thoracic RT should be the minimum that is required to palliate thoracic symptoms or whether treatment should be more intensive, with the aim of prolonging survival. A total of 509 such patients from 11 centres in the UK between November 1989 and October 1992 were admitted to a trial comparing palliative versus more intensive RT with respect to survival and quality of life. They were allocated at random to receive thoracic RT with either 17 Gy in two fractions (F2) 1 week apart (255 patients) or 39 Gy in 13 fractions (F13) 5 days per week (254 patients). Survival was better in the F13 group, the median survival periods being 7 months in the F2 group compared with 9 months in the F13 group, and the survival rates 31% and 36% at one year and 9% and 12% at 2 years, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.82; 95% CI0.69-0.99). There was a suggestion of a trend towards greater benefit in fitter patients. Metastases appeared earlier in the F2 group. As recorded by patients using the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the commonest symptoms on admission were cough, shortness of breath, tiredness, lack of energy, worrying and chest pain. These were more rapidly palliated by the F2 regimen. Psychological distress was generally lower in the F13 group. Three patients (two F13, one F2) exhibited evidence of myelopathy. As recorded by patients using a diary card, 76% of the F2 compared with 81% of the F13 patients had dysphagia associated with their RT. This was transient, lasting for a median of 6.5 days in the F2 group compared with 14 days in the F13 group. In conclusion, the F2 regimen had a more rapid palliative effect. In the F13 group, although treatment-related dysphagia was worse, survival was longer.",Excluded

Participants were stratified by stage (IIIA v IIIB), histology (nonsquamous v squamous), and therapy (surgery v none) and were randomly assigned to PCI or observation. PCI was delivered to 30 Gy in 15 fractions. The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS), neurocognitive function (NCF), and quality of life. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses were used for OS and DFS. The incidence of brain metastasis (BM) was evaluated with the logistic regression model.RESULTS: Overall, 356 patients were accrued of the targeted 1,058. The study was closed early because of slow accrual; 340 of the 356 patients were eligible. The 1-year OS (P = .86; 75.6% v 76.9% for PCI v observation) and 1-year DFS (P = .11; 56.4% v 51.2% for PCI v observation) were not significantly different. The hazard ratio for observation versus PCI was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.36). The 1-year rates of BM were significantly different (P = .004; 7.7% v 18.0% for PCI v observation). Patients in the observation arm were 2.52 times more likely to develop BM than those in the PCI arm (unadjusted odds ratio, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.32 to 4.80).CONCLUSION: In patients with stage III disease without progression of disease after therapy, PCI decreased the rate of BM but did not improve OS or DFS.",Included

Similarly, a few case studies have reported the effectiveness of SBRT for stage I small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, no study has investigated the use of SBRT for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Compared with conventional RT, SBRT is able to deliver a higher radiation dose precisely and safely to small targets in short-duration treatments. The present study reports the outcome of a patient with ES-SCLC who responded favorably to initial chemotherapy and received SBRT for a residual mass in the peripheral lung. A 62-year-old female presented with pathologically determined SCLC at clinical stage T4N3M0-T4 as separate tumor nodules were present in different ipsilateral lobes. The patient received 6 cycles of standard chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. The response of the patient to chemotherapy was evaluated using contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography. The only suspected residual viable tumor was a 1.5-cm mass in the right upper lobe. Targeting this mass, intensity-modulated SBRT was performed with 48 Gy in 4 fractions and 6 MV photons. In addition, prophylactic cranial irradiation was conducted with 25 Gy in 10 fractions. The patient is alive with no evidence of disease 4 years after treatment. SBRT toxicity was limited to radiation pneumonitis or fibrosis without pulmonary symptoms.

1797,"Sparing of cochleae and eyes in whole brain radiation therapy with boost by helical tomotherapy and noncoplanar VMAT Purpose/Objective: Simple low conformity lateral opposing radiation beams with limited sparing to proximal organs-atrisk (OARs) were widely adopted in the past for treating palliative whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Crucial OARs located at skull base used to sacrifice with significant radiation dose inevitably. More conformal radiation treatments, like helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), are becoming more accepted to treat WBRT. These techniques allow not only conformal dose to the whole brain but also simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) doses to dedicated metastases for superior disease control and symptom relief. This study aimed to investigate any potential advantages in cochleae and eyes sparing between HT and non-coplanar VMAT. Material(s) and Method(s): Treatment planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 15 brain metastasis patients who had received palliative dose WBRTs with SIBs to the metastases in the department were recruited. Each patient was re-planned with HT and non-coplanar VMAT for dosimetric comparison. Departmental routine optimal settings with fan beam thickness of 2.5cm and pitch value of 0.287 were used in all HT plans. One coplanar full arc plus two non-coplanar half arcs modulating by Varian Millennium 120 MLCs were used in all VMAT plans. The two non-coplanar half arcs were arranged at 60 degrees offset to each other and to the coplanar full arc to cover the cranial hemisphere. All target volumes were optimized according to original prescriptions. The median whole brain dose was 30Gy (range 25-40Gy) and the median SIB dose was 35Gy (range 30-45Gy). The mean SIB volume was 26.7+/-30.4cc consisting 1.7+/-1.8% of the whole brain volume 1481.8+/-161.1cc. Radiation doses to cochleae and eyes were studied by comparing their maximum doses (Dmax) and mean doses (Dmean). The dose results from the two techniques were tested statistically by paired t-test considering significant level of p-value <0.05. Result(s): The dose results are listed in Table 1. Non-coplanar VMAT significantly achieved lower Dmax and Dmean to both cochleae than HT (all p<0.001). Radiation doses to both eyes were slightly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT but could not be shown statistically significant (all p>0.05). However, the Dmax and Dmean to both lens were significantly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion(s): Non-coplanar VMAT is superior to HT in sparing cochleae which are relatively small and highly proximal to target volumes. There is no significant dose difference in eyes sparing for both techniques. Non-coplanar VMAT is preferred to treat WBRT with SIB if slight increase in lens doses is not a concern.

No marked increase in fetal mortality or growth retardation was observed below 0.25 Gy; the increase in these parameters was significant only at 0.50 Gy. A significant reduction in head size and brain weight and a significant increase in the incidence of microphthalmia were observed at doses above 0.15 Gy. Detectable levels of microcephaly and microphthalmia were evident even at 0.10 Gy. A linear dose response was seen for these effects in the dose range of 0.05 to 0.15 Gy.

Changes developing in the gait of the group of pigs receiving a mean maximum dose of 24.3 Gy after 10-15 weeks led to the irradiation of two additional animals. They received mean maximum dose of 24.9 +/- 0.2 Gy (n=2), targeted to the left spinal nerves of C5-C8. The followup period was one year. Histologic sections from spinal cords and available spinal nerves were evaluated. MR imaging was performed on pigs in the 24.9 Gy group.RESULTS: No pig that received a maximum spinal nerve point dose <=19.0 Gy experienced a change in gait while all pigs that received >=24.1 Gy experienced paralysis. Extensive degeneration and fibrosis were observed in irradiated spinal nerves of the 24.9 Gy animals. All spinal cord sections were normal. Irradiated spinal nerve regions showed increased thickness and hypointensity on MR imaging.CONCLUSION: The single-session tolerance dose of the cervical spinal nerves lies between 19.0 and 24.1 Gy for this model.",Included

Emerging evidence in the healthcare literature shows the potential role of DP theory-driven approaches to skill acquisition in educational settings. While it has been extensively reviewed in other health professions, there is a lack of empirical evidence of its value within the medical radiation science (MRS) professions. Professional capabilities and accreditation standards highlight the minimum level of competence for graduates to safely practise the profession. Many of these defined competencies and standards involve observable complex psychomotor and cognitive skills. In this paper, the authors review the concept of deliberate practice, clarify the guiding principles and offer some examples of successful DP implementations within educational contexts. The authors draw on specific examples from the sonography and radiation therapy educational contexts and provide strategies for isolating and improving various domain-specific skills. While the concept of DP may appear relevant to the development of different MRS skills, a lack of development of evidence-based DP frameworks for MRS is evident. It will require extensive research and collaboration, with the primary aim of accelerating student and practitioner confidence, ultimately improving the quality of patient care and safety with the medical radiation practices.",Excluded
2352,"Adenosine A2A receptors are essential for long-term potentiation of NMDA-EPSCs at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses The physiological conditions under which adenosine A2A receptors modulate synaptic transmission are presently unclear. We show that A2A receptors are localized postsynaptically at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells and are essential for a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA-EPSCs induced by short bursts of mossy fiber stimulation. This LTP spares AMPA-EPSCs and is likely induced and expressed postsynaptically. It depends on a postsynaptic Ca2+ rise, on G protein activation, and on Src kinase. In addition to A2A receptors, LTP of NMDA-EPSCs requires the activation of NMDA and mGluR5 receptors as potential sources of Ca2+ increase. LTP of NMDA-EPSCs displays a lower threshold for induction as compared with the conventional presynaptic mossy fiber LTP; however, the two forms of LTP can combine with stronger induction protocols. Thus, postsynaptic A2A receptors may potentially affect information processing in CA3 neuronal networks and memory performance.",Excluded

In a previous study, we have found that rats fed with high-fat (HIF) diet developed diet-induced obesity (DIO) with a concomitant decrease in the hypothalamic content of the cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide, a peptide with anorexiogenic effect. To assess the central effect of EA on DIO rat, we revealed that EA up-regulated the expression of CART peptide in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the DIO rats. After feeding with HIF diet for 14 weeks, the DIO rats received EA stimulation three times per week for 4 weeks. The expression of CART peptide in ARC was measured using immunohistochemistry. The plasma ACTH was measured with ELISA. EA caused a reduction of both body weight and energy intake in DIO rats and increased the expression of CART peptide in ARC. The plasma ACTH was increased in response to restraint stress, but EA produced no further increase in ACTH levels. The results suggest that EA can up-regulate the expression of CART peptide to approach normal level, resulting in an inhibition of food intake and a reduction of body weight in DIO rats.",Excluded
1521,"Influence of a complex magnetic field application in rats upon thermal nociceptive thresholds: the importance of polarity and timing The application of a weak (1 microTesla) complex magnetic field pattern with a relevant electrophysiological signature produced an analgesic response in rats to thermal stimuli when the pattern was presented once every 4 sec for 30 min through iron-core solenoids. In one experiment, the burst-firing pattern was presented once every 4 s for 30 min and restricted to the positive polarity, negative polarity or a bipolar equivalent. The strongest analgesia occurred when the burst-firing pattern was presented with positive polarity or as the typical bipolar signal. Administrations of the burst-firing pattern once per week for four consecutive weeks produced analgesia that was clearly evident during the first, third, and fourth weeks but not during the second week of treatment. A telephone sensor coil (that can be readily obtained from local electronic shops) was then used instead of the solenoids along with an audio (.wav) file to generate the magnetic field; the analgesia was still apparent.

The spontaneous SCE levels did not differ between patients and controls, but the cells from each of the patients showed a significantly enhanced response to the induction of SCE by both mutagens - the patients' cells being up to 50% more sensitive than controls. Cultures from five FrA patients and five controls were analysed to determine the spontaneous incidence of chromosomal aberrations and exposed to a graded series of X-ray doses to measure their response to radiation-induced chromosome damage. The spontaneous aberration incidence in controls did not differ from that found in other control series, but the background incidence of aberrations in cells from the FrA patients was significantly above control levels and appeared to reflect an enhanced response to diagnostic exposure to radionuclides. The FrA cells showed a significantly enhanced in vitro response to chromosome aberration induction by X-rays, the net aberration yields being some 60% greater than those in irradiated controls at doses up to 200 rads.

Possible factors responsible for this hypersensitivity are discussed and comparisons drawn with ataxia telangiectasia, another autosomal recessive disease characterized by enhanced X-ray sensitivity.",Excluded
319,"Effect of low dose radiation on cognition, cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status Radiation exposure has multiple effects on the brain, behaviour and cognitive functions.

This study was undertaken to assess the acute effects of low doses of radiation on cognitive functions, serum cortisol, serotonin and antioxidant status, 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice received either sham treatment or irradiation (0.5, 1 and 3 Gy) and were tested for the alterations in the normal behaviour within 10 days.

Rats received amitriptyline (2 mg/kg per day) or saline via intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps for 21 days.

There was no reduction in any of the projection areas studied, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus or striatum. The data suggest that chronic low doses of amitriptyline can lead to sustained 5-HT re-uptake inhibition selectively in the raphe nuclei, an effect compatible with tonic activation of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT synthesis. The failure of chronic amitriptyline treatment to affect 5-HT synthesis rate in the projection areas may ensure an adequate regulation of pain pathways implicated in migraine headache, an effect possibly related to amitriptyline anti-migraine efficacy.",Excluded

Under voltage-clamp conditions the cell displayed large spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) with average peak amplitude of 98 +/- 39 pA and average frequency of 0.45 +/- 0.22 s(-1). To a light step, ACs gave rise to a transient 'On' response at the light onset and a transient 'Off' response at light offset, followed by a train of TDPs ('After' response). Near the response threshold (0.3 activated rhodopsin molecules per rod per second), light-evoked TDPs (leTDPs) of similar amplitude and kinetics as the large sTDPs observed in darkness were seen, and about half of these leTDPs elicited a regenerative potential (RP). Brighter light steps gave rise to more leTDPs and higher rates of RPs in the On, Off and After responses. Within the linear response range of the rods, the AC response was non-linear, with the highest gain (676 +/- 429) near the dark potential. The amplitude of Off responses increased with the duration of the light step, and ACs may use this to encode speeds of moving stimuli: the faster the light object moves, the smaller the AC Off response. Moreover, the number of leTDPs in the AC After response increased with light intensity, and the onset of the After response coincides with bipolar cell tail response recovery. One possible origin of the large sTDPs and leTDPs is the spontaneous and depolarization-induced regenerative calcium potentials (RCaPs) in bipolar cell synaptic terminals. RCaPs in bipolar cell synaptic terminals cause transient glutamate release that results in the sTDPs in darkness, and leTDPs in On, Off and After responses in ACs.",Excluded

Apoptosis was quantified using morphology and end-labeling immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation was detected using antibodies against the thymidine analog BrdU and the cyclin-dependent kinase p34(cdc2). Radiation-induced apoptosis occurred rapidly, with maximum morphological and end-labeling changes observed 3-6h after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to sham-irradiated controls. The number of apoptotic nuclei increased rapidly with radiation dose, reaching a plateau at about 3Gy. The maximum number of apoptotic nuclei was substantially higher than the number of proliferating cells, suggesting that non-proliferating as well as proliferating cells in the subgranular zone were sensitive to irradiation. Subgranular zone cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to age-matched controls 120 days after doses of 5Gy or higher. These findings suggest that neural precursor cells of the dentate gyrus are very sensitive to irradiation and are not capable of repopulating the subgranular zone at least up to 120 days after irradiation. This may help explain, in part, how ionizing irradiation induces cognitive impairments in animals and humans.",Included

2139,"Inhibiting the inhibition: a neuronal network for sound localization in reverberant environments The precedence effect describes the phenomenon whereby echoes are spatially fused to the location of an initial sound by selectively suppressing the directional information of lagging sounds (echo suppression). Echo suppression is a prerequisite for faithful sound localization in natural environments but can break down depending on the behavioral context. To date, the neural mechanisms that suppress echo directional information without suppressing the perception of echoes themselves are not understood. We performed in vivo recordings in Mongolian gerbils of neurons of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL), a GABAergic brainstem nucleus that targets the auditory midbrain, and show that these DNLL neurons exhibit inhibition that persists tens of milliseconds beyond the stimulus offset, so-called persistent inhibition (PI). Using in vitro recordings, we demonstrate that PI stems from GABAergic projections from the opposite DNLL. Furthermore, these recordings show that PI is attributable to intrinsic features of this GABAergic innervation. Implementation of these physiological findings into a neuronal model of the auditory brainstem demonstrates that, on a circuit level, PI creates an enhancement of responsiveness to lagging sounds in auditory midbrain cells. Moreover, the model revealed that such response enhancement is a sufficient cue for an ideal observer to identify echoes and to exhibit echo suppression, which agrees closely with the percepts of human subjects.",Excluded
246,"Palliative radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer The palliative treatment of patients with NSCLC should be individualized. Treatment decisions should be directed by the goal of maximizing the patient's quality of life, and the patient's wishes should always be ascertained. The approaches to palliative radiation treatment of the chest, bones, and brain are quite similar. Treatment of the chest and bones is usually reserved until symptoms are significant. Brain metastases are generally treated soon after diagnosis. With respect to dose- fractionation schedules, the data are not conclusive. In theory, more protracted schedules of 40 to 50 Gy in 4 to 5 weeks are associated with more durable responses and less long-term morbidity than are shorter and lower- dose schedules. These regimens are therefore worth considering for the most favorable subset of palliative patients (ie, those with good performance status and low burden of disease). At the other end of the spectrum, very ill patients with poor performance status may be best served by short hypofractionated schedules such as 20 Gy in five fractions, 17 Gy in two fractions, or possibly 8 to 10 Gy in one fraction. Response rates with these regimens are good, trips to the treatment facility are minimized, and these ill patients will probably not live long enough to experience the higher long-term toxicity rates associated with larger treatment fractions. The majority of patients, however, fall between these two extremes and are well served by schedules such as 30 Gy in 10 fractions.

1440,"Review of severe osteoradionecrosis treated by surgery alone or surgery with postoperative hyperbaric oxygenation We reviewed 41 patients with osteoradionecrosis of the mandible. Each patient was treated by radical resection followed by external beam irradiation. The diagnosis of infected osteoradionecrosis was confirmed clinically, radiologically, and histologically. After operation had failed, 20/41 were given hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) as in 'salvage' treatment. Daily sessions of HBO 2.5 ATA for 60 minutes (mean: 29 sessions) were given. The other 21 patients were treated by operation and antibiotics alone. HBO group (n = 20): The overall success rate for HBO after operation had failed was 13/20. Repeated debridement as first-line treatment followed by postoperative HBO was successful in 12/19. In seven of 19 patients, partial mandibulectomy and microvascular transplantation were required as second-line treatment, and this was successful in five. Primary partial mandibulectomy and microvascular transplantation followed by HBO was successful in 1 patient. Non-HBO group (n = 21): Repeated debridement was successful in 10/11 patients. Partial mandibulectomy was required as second-line treatment in the remaining one. In the other 10, partial mandibulectomy and microvascular transplantation were successful as first-line treatment in four. In the remaining six, further surgical intervention became necessary and were successful for 5-17 months (mean: 13). With a success rate of 13/20, we do not recommend HBO for the treatment of osteoradionecrosis.",Excluded

This is supposed to be mainly due to the short half-life of a majority of newly formed cells. These data provide further evidence on the redundant cell proliferation taking place in the small pool of brain cell population scattered throughout the parenchyma of the brain of young adult mice.,Excluded
2300,"Molecular events associated with increased regenerative capacity of the goldfish retinal ganglion cells following X-irradiation: decreased level of axonal growth inhibitors In our previous work we established conditions to study the contribution of non-neuronal cells to the process of goldfish optic nerve regeneration. This issue has been studied successfully by adapting the use of X-irradiation to manipulate division of non-neuronal cells associated with the injured nerve. The regenerative capacity of the goldfish retinal ganglion cells was determined subsequent to the X-ray treatment. In this work we present an analysis of the molecular events associated with regeneration and enhanced regenerative capacity which follows X-irradiation. Under normal conditions the non-neuronal cells surrounding an intact nerve released axonal growth inhibitors, the level of which was only slightly sensitive to X-irradiation. In contrast, regenerating nerves showed a marked decrease in substances having an inhibitory effect on sprouting in vitro. Moreover, their level was significantly reduced following X-irradiation which was accompanied by increased accumulation of fibrous collagen adjacent to astrocytes. The alteration in the reciprocal relationship between the axon and the surrounding non-neuronal cells was also manifested by changes in the profile of labeled proteins released by the non-neuronal cells. The results of this work, therefore, indicate the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells to the environment provided by the cells surrounding the regenerating fibers and thus may open a new perspective relating to the capacity of neurons to regenerate.",Included
2331,"Feasibility, Safety, and Periprocedural Complications of Pipeline Embolization for Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment Under Conscious Sedation: University at Buffalo Neurosurgery Experience BACKGROUND: Endovascular Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) placement for intracranial aneurysms is performed under general anesthesia at most centers because of perceived improved image quality and patient safety.OBJECTIVE: To report the feasibility, safety, and outcomes associated with the use of the PED for intracranial aneurysms performed in awake patients after the administration of conscious sedation (CS) and a local anesthetic.METHODS: Between March 2012 and September 2014, 130 patients with 139 intracranial aneurysms (8 ruptured) were treated with the PED under CS at our institution. Procedure details and time (including duration, radiation exposure, and fluoroscopy) and procedure-related complications were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: A total of 155 PED deployment procedures were performed under CS. Treatment was successfully completed in all cases. Anesthesia was converted from CS to general anesthesia during 5 procedures. Mean interval from patient entry at the endovascular suite to procedure initiation was 18 minutes (range, 5 minutes-1 hour 10 minutes). Mean procedure length was 1 hour 25 minutes (range, 30 minutes-3 hours 51 minutes). Mean +/- SD values for fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure were 36.17 +/- 18.4 minutes and 1367 +/- 897 mGy, respectively. The mean amount of contrast material administered was 211.37 +/- 83.5 mL. Permanent neurological complications were seen in 4 patients (3%).CONCLUSION: In our experience, CS for PED placement for intracranial aneurysm treatment is feasible and safe. Procedure and fluoroscopy times and amount of radiation exposure are similar to or less than described in reports of PED placement under general anesthesia. CS allows direct neurological evaluation and earlier detection of and response to intraprocedural complications.",Excluded
2313,"Differential actions of corticotropin releasing factor on basolateral and central amygdaloid neurones, in vitro Intracellular current- and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from basolateral (BLA) and central (ACe) neurones of the rat amygdala in vitro. The effect of superfusion of rat corticotropin releasing factor (rCRF) was examined on the ACe and BLA, nuclei with a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cell bodies and CRF receptors, respectively. rCRF (12.5-250 nM) had no effect on either resting membrane potential or input resistance in BLA neurones. In contrast, at low nanomolar concentrations rCRF (10-50 nM) caused hyperpolarisation and decreased membrane input resistance in the majority of ACe neurones. The equilibrium potential for this effect was -84 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM), suggesting that this response may be mediated by a postsynaptic increase in K+ conductance. Furthermore, rCRF consistently reduced the amplitude of, and the current mediating, the slow after hyperpolarisation following evoked action potential firing in both nuclei. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 40 nM in BLA neurones and was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and noradrenergic antagonists. In addition, the putative CRF antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 (5 microM) blocked the effect of rCRF and showed partial agonist action on slow after hyperpolarisations. In BLA neurones, rCRF (50 nM) prolonged the Ca(2+)-spike evoked in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium (2 mM), suggesting that the blockade of the slow after hyperpolarisation occurs subsequent to Ca2+ entry. These results suggest that rCRF has a differential effect on the membrane properties of BLA and ACe neurones possibly by activation of a heterogeneous population of CRF receptors.",Excluded
417,"Senile amyloidosis and neuron binding antibody in the aging Syrian hamster The effects of age, sex, and irradiation on the genesis of amyloidosis, neuron-binding antibody (NBA), and the concomitant appearance of these two phenomena were studied in a colony of Syrian hamsters. In nonirradiated controls amyloidosis increased in prevalence with age after 12 months, and prevalence was higher in females than in males. Irradiation had the effect of advancing the appearance of amyloidosis to the 7-12 months group but did not intensify the amyloidotic process. IgG binding to the nucleus or cytoplasm of neurons was rare, and, despite the fact that IgM and IgA binding to these structures was present in about one-third of the animals, there was neither an aging nor an irradiation effect. The only statistically significant findings with respect to the concomitant occurrence of amyloid and NBA were negative correlations between nuclear IgM and IgA binding and amyloidosis. Of the various species thus far studied, the hamster is the first in which there has been no aging effect in respect to NBA.",Included
1242,"Sonic Hedgehog signaling impairs ionizing radiation-induced checkpoint activation and induces genomic instability The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway plays important roles in embryogenesis, stem cell maintenance, tissue repair, and tumorigenesis. Haploinsufficiency of Patched-1, a gene that encodes a repressor of the Shh pathway, dysregulates the Shh pathway and increases genomic instability and the development of spontaneous and ionizing radiation (IR)-induced tumors by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that Ptc1(+/-) mice have a defect in the IR-induced activation of the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint signaling pathway. Likewise, transient expression of Gli1, a downstream target of Shh signaling, disrupts Chk1 activation in human cells by preventing the interaction of Chk1 with Claspin, a Chk1 adaptor protein that is required for Chk1 activation. These results suggest that inappropriate Shh pathway activation promotes tumorigenesis by disabling a key signaling pathway that helps maintain genomic stability and inhibits tumorigenesis.",Excluded
177,"Comparative human cellular radiosensitivity: I. The effect of SV40 transformation and immortalisation on the gamma-irradiation survival of skin derived fibroblasts from normal individuals and from ataxia-telangiectasia patients and heterozygotes We have compared cell killing following 60Co gamma irradiation in 22 primary human fibroblast strains, nine SV40-immortalized human fibroblast lines and seven SV40-transformed pre-crisis human fibroblast cultures. We have examined material from normal individuals, from ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients and from A-T heterozygotes. We have confirmed the greater sensitivity of A-T derived cells to gamma radiation. The distinction between A-T and normal cells is maintained in cells immortalized by SV40 virus but the immortal cells are more gamma radiation resistant than the corresponding primary fibroblasts. Cells transformed by plasmids (pSV3gpt and pSV3neo) expressing SV40 T-antigen, both pre- and post-crisis, show this increased resistance, indicating that it is expression of SV40 T-antigen, rather than immortalization per se which is responsible for the change. We use D0, obtained from a straight line fit, and D, estimated from a multitarget curve, as parameters to compare radiosensitivity. We suggest that both have their advantages; D0 is perhaps more reproducible, but D is more realistic when comparing shouldered and non-shouldered data.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of CTLA-4 inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic melanoma with limited brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Between January 2008 and June 2011, 58 patients with limited brain metastases from melanoma were treated with SRS with a median dose of 20 Gy delivered to the 50% isodose line (range, 15-20 Gy). In 25 patients, ipilimumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg over 90 min every 3 weeks for a median of four doses (range, 1-8). Local control (LC), freedom from new brain metastases, and overall survival (OS) were assessed from the date of the SRS procedure. The median LC, freedom from new brain metastases, and OS for the entire group were 8.7, 4.3, and 5.9 months, respectively. The cause of death was CNS progression in all but eight patients. Six-month LC, freedom from new brain metastases, and OS were 65, 35, and 56%, respectively, for those who received ipilimumab and 63, 47, and 46% for those who did not (P=NS). Intracranial hemorrhage was noted in seven patients who received ipilimumab compared with 10 patients who received SRS alone (P=NS). In this retrospective study, administration of ipilimumab neither increased toxicity nor improved intracerebral disease control in patients with limited brain metastases who received SRS. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

FTD has the core features of earlier decline and impairment in regulation of social interpersonal conduct.We describe a case of an elderly female who was found to have features of FTD which had directly resulted from gamma knife surgery. This is the first described case of left FTD secondary to gamma knife radiation to our knowledge. Case: The patient is a 76 year old African American female, otherwise healthy and on no any medications with a history of a left frontotemporal arteriovenous malformation. She underwent gamma knife radiation treatment resulting in radiation necrosis eight years prior to presentation. She presented to the clinic escorted by her daughter who observed personality changes in the patient including becoming argumentative, uncooperative, and increasingly hyper religious, with increased interpersonal conflicts surrounding patient's inability to follow-through on plans. The patient only admitted to trouble with memory. Patient was observed to have disinhibition and inappropriateness during the group interview. Geriatric Depression Scale was negative for depression. Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 15/30 with deficits including: recall 0/5, language (1/3 naming, 0/2 repetition, 0/1 fluency with only 3 F words), calculation 0/3; while attention and orientations were intact. Patient was unable to perform Trail-making test, Part B. Otherwise, she appeared robust, independent in ADL but needing some assistance with IADL. Given her behavioral changes including tactlessness and poor social judgment, executive dysfunction, memory impairment and language deficits in the context of prior left frontal lobe radiation injury, she was given the diagnosis of left predominant FTD. Conclusion(s): Isolated and localized brain anomalies and their treatment are the rare causes of brain dysfunctions. In this unfortunate case, our patient's FTD is a direct result of her iatrogenic radiation necrosis. Appropriate diagnosis of this patient's condition via correlation of her cognitive deficit with radiographic findings allowed for appropriate counseling of both the patient and family in regards to the permanent nature of her condition. This in turn resulted in acceptance of her condition by her family, establishing prognosis and helping to facilitate her long term care plan.",Excluded
2206,"Radio-neuroprotective effect of a phosphatidylcholine derivative in a rat model of irradiation Ionizing radiation playsmajor role in the treatment of brain tumours, but side-effects may restrict the efficiency of therapy. In the present study, our goals were to detect the functional and morphological changes that result in the administration of l-alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC), a deacylated derivative of phosphatidylcholine, in a rodent model of hippocampus irradiation. Anaesthetized SPRD rats were subjected to 40-Gy irradiation of one hemisphere of the brain, with or without GPC treatment (50 mg/kg per os). After the irradiation the rats received GPC or the vehicle at the same time every second day at 5 days per week. The effects of partial rat brain irradiation on the spatial orientation and learning ability of rats were assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, which was performed once before and two times after the irradiation. At the same time morphological changes were detected by MRI to define the time-point for histological examinations. Irradiation of 40-Gy resulted in moderate neurological deficit both at the level of cognitive function and morphology after 4 weeks of irradiation. The MWM test was found to be a highly sensitive tool for the detection of neurofunctional impairment. We found that the place navigational function of the ratswas impaired by the irradiation and the treatment with GPC could prevent this damage. Marked protective effect of the GPC was detected as concerns of the histopathological findings. Targeted brain irradiation induced notable changes in the central nervous system. GPC supplementation provides significant protection against irradiation-caused functional and morphological disturbances.",Included
3153,"A colourful clock Circadian rhythms are an essential property of life on Earth. In mammals, these rhythms are coordinated by a small set of neurons, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The environmental light/dark cycle synchronizes (entrains) the SCN via a distinct pathway, originating in a subset of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) that utilize the photopigment melanopsin (OPN4). The pRGCs are also innervated by rods and cones and, so, are both endogenously and exogenously light sensitive. Accumulating evidence has shown that the circadian system is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV), blue, and green wavelengths of light. However, it was unclear whether colour perception itself can help entrain the SCN. By utilizing both behavioural and electrophysiological recording techniques, Walmsley and colleagues show that multiple photic channels interact and enhance the capacity of the SCN to synchronize to the environmental cycle. Thus, entrainment of the circadian system combines both environmental irradiance and colour information to ensure that internal and external time are appropriately aligned.",Excluded

Diagnosis of cardiovascular disease(CVD) and type II diabetes mellitus (TIIDM) was established in accordance with diagnostic standards adopted inUkraine. All study subjects had no signs of CVD, and neither of endocrine disease nor of metabolic disorders beforethe accident.RESULTS: Clinical course of the TIIDM, depending on the disease severity, onset of angiopathy and polyneuropathy,prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure were surveyed and analyzed. Concomitant TIIDM was associated witha higher incidence of angina pectoris and heart failure. According to the Kaplan-Meier method of survival estimatingthe accumulation of new TIIDM cases occurred faster in the ACUW compared with individuals in the CG, however withno statistical significance in subjects aged up to 60 years old (log-rank test chi2 = 4.89, p = 0.027). Mean age of theACUW having comorbid CVD and DM was (54.6 +/- 9.7) years, whilst in the CG it was (59.9 +/- 10.7) years (p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: The DM course in the ACUW was not significantly different from non-irradiated control both in sever-ity and such complications as angiopathy of retina and lower extremities, as well as manifestations of lower extrem-ity polyneuropathy. Clinical manifestations of CVD in the form of angina pectoris and heart failure were identical inthe ACUW and control group of patients having a comorbid TIIDM. The latter was a factor exacerbating the CVDcourse and leading to a higher prevalence of angina pectoris and heart failure both in the ACUW and in non-irritat-ed individuals. Accumulation of the new DM cases occurred more rapidly in ACUW vs. non-irradiated control, so theywere in average 5 years younger at the time of TIIDM manifestation than the control subjects.",Included

Numerous studies worldwide yielded variable results ranging from ineffectivity to an efficacy rate of more than 50 % for the reduction of depressive symptoms. A comparison of the effectiveness of TMS across studies is difficult due to the variety of chosen stimulation parameters, different inclusion criteria, and different designs. The discrepancies in results could be partially in account to these factors. From a pathophysiological point of view, there are no empirically justified parameters published carrying out an antidepressant TMS. Further studies are required to find optimal stimulation parameters using complementary methods like functional imaging techniques or regarding other factors that could interfere with its efficacy.

3405,"Processing of modulated sounds in the zebra finch auditory midbrain: responses to noise, frequency sweeps, and sinusoidal amplitude modulations The avian auditory midbrain nucleus, the mesencephalicus lateralis, dorsalis (MLd), is the first auditory processing stage in which multiple parallel inputs converge, and it provides the input to the auditory thalamus. We studied the responses of single MLd neurons to four types of modulated sounds: 1) white noise; 2) band-limited noise; 3) frequency modulated (FM) sweeps, and 4) sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones (SAM) in adult male zebra finches. Responses were compared with the responses of the same neurons to pure tones in terms of temporal response patterns, thresholds, characteristic frequencies, frequency tuning bandwidths, tuning sharpness, and spike rate/intensity relationships. Most neurons responded well to noise. More than one-half of the neurons responded selectively to particular portions of the noise, suggesting that, unlike forebrain neurons, many MLd neurons can encode specific acoustic components of highly modulated sounds such as noise. Selectivity for FM sweep direction was found in only 13% of cells that responded to sweeps. Those cells also showed asymmetric tuning curves, suggesting that asymmetric inhibition plays a role in FM directional selectivity. Responses to SAM showed that MLd neurons code temporal modulation rates using both spike rate and synchronization. Nearly all cells showed low-pass or band-pass filtering properties for SAM. Best modulation frequencies matched the temporal modulations in zebra finch song. Results suggest that auditory midbrain neurons are well suited for encoding a wide range of complex sounds with a high degree of temporal accuracy rather than selectively responding to only some sounds.",Excluded

Special Session Intraprocedural radiation dose management 103.1 Occupational dosimetry in the interventional laboratory: dose limits and risk estimation G. Bartal Radiology, Meir MC, Kfar-Saba, Israel Learning Objectives 1. To learn about the potential risks of occupational radiation exposure 2. To learn about the dose limits for different organs and acceptable dose 3. To learn how to estimate the risks As more evidence is emerging from recent publications on the dangers of occupational radiation exposure in Image (Fluoroscopy) guided interventions there is a clear need to recognize the risks, to learn about staff dose limits and the ways to reduce the possible damage to a Minimum. Recent publications confirm the alarming incidence and variety of occupational-related illnesses of medical staff working in the interventional laboratory (1, 2, 3). International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) issued a new recommendation for the occupational dose limit to the lens of the eye based on the new threshold for lens effects and the suggested equivalent dose limit for the lens of the eye was reduced from 150mSv year-1 (ICRP 2013 Proceedings) to 20mSv year-1, averaged over a 5-year period, with no year's dose exceeding 50mSv (ICRP, 2012). Last International and European BSS (Basic Safety Standards) comprises new limit (European Commission, 2012; IAEA, 2014) for the medical staff (1). Relatively high exposure doses have been reported for both extremities (2) and the eye lens (3, 4) of the Interventional Radiologists (IRs) that in some cases, exceed the personal dose limits. Moreover, new controlled data suggest lower or even no dose threshold for radiation- induced eye lens injuries. These data are under consideration by the ICRP and may lead to the re-evaluation of the existing dose limit (1). There is no ""acceptable dose"" definition or recommendation for the personnel, as it depends on the specific applications and is different for public, workers and patients. There are dose limits for the personnel, which are not applicable to the medical exposure of patients. Noticeably, new dose thresholds, particularly the 0.5 Gy threshold for the lens of the eye, affect occupational protection for operators and other staff, which is principally important for fluoroscopically guided procedures (1, 6). Regrettably, not all operators protect their eyes or their brain sufficiently during interventions. After several years of work without proper protection, cumulative absorbed doses to the lens can exceed 0.5 Gy [ RELID (Retrospective Evaluation of Lens Injuries and Dose) (see: https://rpop.iaea.org/rpop/rpop/content/ news/relid-cataract-study.htm)]. During most of the IAEA surveys of radiation-related lens opacities in interventionalists and staff, 40-50% of the professionals involved in interventional cardiology procedures who volunteered to be examined had posterior subcapsular lens opacities (2, 3, 4). Only 10% of the members of the control groups had such opacities. Important to note that most of the observed lens opacities were in interventionists who had worked for several years without any eye protection. The dose rate to the operator can exceed 10 mSv h-1 when the 'high-dose' fluoroscopy mode is used and 50 mSv h-1 during cine acquisition. The highest dose rate was recorded at the Left Anterior Oblique (LAO 90) projection, which corresponds to the lateral projection when the operator is standing at the tube side (4, 5). Many medical specialties outside the imaging departments (e.g. vascular surgery, urology, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, anaesthetics and pain management) are starting to use or increase their use of fluoroscopically guided procedures in surgical theatres without the radiation protection tools available in standard interventional laboratories (ICRP, 2010). Such a practice may result in occupational doses or these physicians that are higher than the typical values recorded in interventional radiology and cardiology services, where protection tools are used regularly (6). Lack of compliance with the regular use of personal dosimetry has been a problem for many years in many countries (5, 7). This is one of the reasons for the shortage of an accurate occupational dose data (and reliable radiation risk estimations) in different professional groups. One of the methods of estimating staff doses is working on Monte Carlo calculations and detection of staff location in the catheterisation laboratory to calculate approximately staff doses during clinical procedures through the use of radiographic and geometric data. Another method that was recently published is use of a realistic approach to estimate lens doses in interventional cardiology when personal dosimeters are not used regularly. The authors concluded that for around 2000 diagnostic, PCI, and valvular procedures, when the median scatter dose value per procedure at the C-arm was 0.78, 1.07, and 1.45 mSv, respectively (4). Lens doses are approximately 50-60% of these values when radiation protection tools are not used. For all of these procedures, the ratio between the scatter dose at the C-arm and the kerma-area product was 10.3-11.3 mSv(Gy cm2)-1 (6). Several medical societies including CIRSE and SIR have published or endorsed documents on occupational protection that are also expected to improve staff radiation safety (7). New ethical issues are emerging in situations where reducing patient dose involves increasing staff doses and vice versa. Occupational radiological protection is still a challenge in several clinical situations. ICRP has included specific recommendations and advice for occupational protection in most of its publications in recent years (ICRP, 2000, 2007 a,b,c, 2009, 2010, 2013 a,b). Operator dose (incident air kerma) at the typical working position is around 1/1000 of incident air kerma at the patient's skin, so the instantaneous dose rate to an unprotected operator may reach approximately 5mGymin-1. Newer active personal dosimeters display occupational dose rates in real time inside the interventional fluoroscopy suite, and allow subsequent detailed analyses of staff and patient doses by recording dose at very short intervals. This data on implementation of the real time active personnel dosimetry permit the development of new optimisation strategies to improve occupational protection (7, 9).",Excluded

1569,"Imaging the back pain patient Imaging is an integral part of the clinical examination of the patient with back pain; it is, however, often used excessively and without consideration of the underlying literature. The primary role of imaging is the identification of systemic disease as a cause of the back or limb pain; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excels at this. Systemic disease as a cause of back or limb pain is, however, rare. Most back and radiating limb pain is of benign nature, owing to degenerative phenomena. There is no role for imaging in the initial evaluation of the patient with back pain in the absence of signs or symptoms of systemic disease. When conservative care fails, imaging may be undertaken with due consideration of its risks: labeling the patient as suffering from a degenerative disease, cost, radiation exposure, and provoking unwarranted minimally invasive or surgical intervention. Imaging can well depict disc degeneration and disc herniation. Imaging can suggest the presence of discogenic pain, but the lack of a pathoanatomic gold standard obviates any definitive conclusions. The imaging natural history of disc herniation is resolution. There is very poor correlation between imaging findings of disc herniation and the clinical presentation or course. Psychosocial factors predict functional disability due to disc herniation better than imaging. Imaging with MRI, computed tomography (CT), or CT myelography can readily identify central canal, lateral recess, or foraminal compromise. Only when an imaging finding is concordant with the patient's pain pattern or neurologic deficit can causation be considered. The zygapophysial (facet) and sacroiliac joint are thought to be responsible for axial back pain, although with less frequency than the disc.

573,"Cross-sectional analysis of resource utilization among patients with neuroendocrine tumours Background: Although there is high morbidity and mortality associated with neuroendocrine tumours (NET), there are limited data in the literature to quantify the economic impact in this patient population. The aim of this study was to understand resource use among advanced NET patients. Material(s) and Method(s): An online survey was administered to physicians in the US, UK, Germany, France, Brazil, and Italy to collect data on patients with advanced NET. The survey gathered data on the incidence and frequency of resource use (e.g. chemotherapy, somatostatin analogs [SSA], PRRT). Result(s): Of the 4,100 surveys administered, 197 physicians participated (4.8%), providing data for 394 NET patients. Among all patients, nonpancreatic GI tract was the most common primary site (45.4%), followed by pancreas (30.7%). Resource utilization was high across tumour types as shown in Table 1. The most common types of chemotherapy used were: 5-fluorouracil (16.2%), etoposide (15.5%), and cisplatin (14.8%). (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): Results confirm that advanced NET is associated with significant resource use, regardless of tumour site. In addition to SSAs, patients are treated with chemotherapy and radiation-based approaches and twice as many patients are treated with targeted therapies in the pNET group as compared to the GI/Lung NET population.",Excluded

3339,"Contribution of the Atm protein to maintaining cellular homeostasis evidenced by continuous activation of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient brains Maintenance of genome stability is essential for keeping cellular homeostasis. The DNA damage response is a central component in maintaining genome integrity. Among of the most cytotoxic DNA lesions are double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic chemicals. ATM is missing or inactivated in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. Ataxia-telangiectasia patients display a pleiotropic phenotype and suffer primarily from progressive ataxia caused by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons. Additional features are immunodeficiency, genomic instability, radiation sensitivity, and cancer predisposition. Disruption of the mouse Atm locus creates a murine model of ataxia-telangiectasia that exhibits most of the clinical features of the human disease but very mild neuronal abnormality. The ATM protein is a multifunctional protein kinase, which serves as a master regulator of cellular responses to DSBs. There is growing evidence that ATM may be involved in addition to the DSB response in other processes that maintain processes in cellular homeostasis. For example, mounting evidence points to increased oxidative stress in the absence of ATM. Here we report that the AP-1 pathway is constantly active in the brains of Atm-deficient mice not treated with DNA damaging agents. A canonical activation (increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and c-Jun) of the AP-1 pathway was found in Atm-deficient cerebra, whereas induction of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient cerebella is likely to mediate elevated expression of c-Fos and c-Jun. Although Atm(+/+) mice are capable of responding to ionizing radiation by activating stress responses such as the AP-1 pathway, Atm-deficient mice display higher basal AP-1 activity but gradually lose their ability to activate AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to ionizing radiation. Our results further demonstrate that inactivation of the ATM gene results in a state of constant stress.",Excluded
738,"[Influence of low magnetic field on lipid peroxidation] UNLABELLED: Free radicals (FR) are atoms, molecules or their fragments, whose excess leads to the development of the oxidizing stress, which is the cause of many neoplasmic, neurodegenerative, inflammatory diseases and aging the organism. The main exogenous sources of free radicals are among others: industrial pollution, tobacco smoke, ionizing radiation, ultrasound and magnetic field. The low frequency magnetic field is more and more applied in the physician therapy. The aim of our study was to prove, if the magnetically field applied in the magntetotherapy, affects generating the reactive forms of oxygen according to its working time.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research material made up male, adult, Sprague-Dawley race rats age 3-4 months. To investigation compounds reacting with the tiobarbituric acid, the blood was taken from the rat caudal vein into the test-glass including EDTA before being affected by the magnetic field. After the single exposition and after 14 days of being affected by the magnetic field, the concentration of the compounds reacting with the tiobarbituric acid in the serum was measured.RESULTS: After the single exposition to the changeable magnetic field (frequency 40 Hz, induction 7 mT, working time 30' and 60 min) the process of the peroxidation of lipids slowed down. A increase of the peroxidation of lipids was observed after 14 days and these changes are statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Low magnetic field used in magnetotherapy causes the changes of the generating the reactive forms of oxygen.",Excluded

1341,"Central nervous system burkitt variant post-transplant lymphopro life rative disorder (PTLD) Learning Objective #1: Recognize that PTLD as part of the differential when post transplant individuals present with unexplained pain, fever, or organ dysfunction. Learning Objective #2: Burkitt Lymphoma subtype as well as CNS involvement represent more aggressive manifestations of PTLD and should be managed more aggressively. CASE: 72 year-old man with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy status post living donor renal transplant on tacro-limus presents with headache, diplopia, and blurry vision found to have CNIII palsy on neurologic examination. Facial CT and Gadolinium enhanced Brain MRI showed complete bilateral maxillary sinus opacification and leptomeningeal enhancement. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, but given continuous headache and concern for meningitis a lumbar puncture was performed. CSF studies showed atypical lymphocytes of predominantly monoclonal B cells. CSF FISH showed rearrangement of c-myc oncogene negative for rearrangement of bcl6 or bcl2. Serum LDH was elevated and peripheral EBV PCR was positive. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for malignancy. Further CT imaging revealed thickening of the small bowel and mesenteric lymph-adenopathy. Patient was started on dexamethasone, intrathecal metho-trexate, and R-Hyper CVAD with interval regression of abdominal LAD, mass, improvement in ptosis, and decrease in LDH. IMPACT: The case represents an uncommon manifestation of an rare variant of disease that should warrant a different approach to diagnosis and treatment. DISCUSSION: PTLD is a well recognized, heterogenous group of disorders. The mechanism of PTLD involves EBV-induced B cell proliferation and antigen mediated T cell activation which upregulate pro-growth factors such as c-Myc. The result of which ranges from early mononucleosis-like illness, polyclonal lymphoid infiltrates, to lymphomas. Therapy involves immune reconstitution, local surgical excision, corticosteroids, antiviral agents, radiation and chemotherapy. Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) is a distinct form of PTLD. BL is an aggressive, mature B cell lymphoma composed of a monomorphic population of lymphoid cells with high mitotic and proliferation rates. Monoclonality is shown as isolated c-myc rearrangement as opposed to rear-rangements in c-myc, bcl6, and bcl2 seen in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the most common form of PTLD. BL represents a distinct monomorphic PTLD and should be managed more aggressively with lymphoma specific chemotherapy rather than simply decreasing immunosuppression. CNS involvement of PTLD is rare, reportedly in 7-15% of all PTLD, when present is predictive of inferior survival. Compared to non-PCNS PTLD, primary CNS PTLD has a higher incidence of monomorphic EBV related disease, and late involvement with poor survival. Prior kidney transplant were also more frequent in primary CNS PTLD compared to other forms of PTLD. As a parallel, in systemic non hodgkins lymphoma, renal localization is also associated with high rates of CNS involvement.",Excluded
1092,"A review on radiogenic Lhermitte's sign Radiation myelopathy is a rare, but extremely serious side-effect of radiotherapy. Recovery from radiation-induced motor sequelae is rare, whereas, the regeneration of sensory losses is relatively frequent. Among the sensory radiogenic injuries of the spinal cord, Lhermitte's sign (LS) is most frequent. This review describes the clinical picture and diagnostic imaging signs of radiogenic LS. There have been only a few studies on large patient groups with radiogenic LS, demonstrating a rate of occurrence of 3.6-13%, relating mainly to mantle irradiation or the radiotherapy of head and neck tumors. These cases typically manifest themselves 3 months following radiotherapy and gradually disappear within 6 months. Only 3 LS cases have been described in the English literature with extraordinarily severe symptoms lasting for more than 1 year. MRI, a sensitive tool in the detection of demyelination, failed to reveal any pathological sign accompanying radiogenic LS. However, positron emission tomography demonstrated increased [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation and [15O]butanol perfusion, but a negligible [11C]methionine uptake in the irradiated spinal cord segments in patients with long-standing LS. These imaging data are suggestive of a close direct relationship between the regional perfusion and metabolism of the spinal cord, very much like the situation in the brain. We postulate that an altered, energy-demanding conduction along the demyelinated axons of patients with chronic radiogenic LS may explain the increased metabolism and perfusion.

91,"Effects of Nigella sativa oil and thymoquinone on radiation-induced oxidative stress in kidney tissue of rats Ionizing radiation leads to release of free radicals into the systemic circulation from irradiated tissues. These free radicals cause oxidative stress in distant organs. Oxidative status may be reversed by naturally occurring antioxidant agents. The aim of this study was to investigate protective and antioxidant effects of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) and thymoquinone (TQ) in kidney tissue of rats exposed to cranial irradiation. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: IR group received irradiation (IR) to total cranium plus saline; IR plus NSO group received IR and NSO; IR plus TQ group received IR and TQ; sham group did not receive NSO, TQ or IR; control group of TQ received dimethyl sulfoxide; control group of NSO received saline. Total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) levels were studied as oxidative parameters, and total antioxidant status (TAS), total sulfhydryl levels, paraoxonase (PON), ceruloplasmin (Cp) and arylesterase activities were determined as antioxidative parameters in the kidney tissue of rats. Kidney TOS, OSI and LOOH levels were significantly lower in IR plus TQ, IR plus NSO and sham groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001). TAS, PON and Cp activities in IR group were significantly lower compared to the control group (p < 0.001). PON and Cp activities were significantly higher in IR plus NSO and IR plus TQ groups compared to IR group (p < 0.001). In conclusion, free radicals generated by cranial ionizing radiation exposure cause oxidative stress in kidney.

Targeting the CD95 apoptotic pathway is a promising experimental approach to these neoplasms. Here, we asked whether irradiation modulates CD95-mediated apoptosis of human malignant glioma cells in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: LN-18, LN-229 and T98G human malignant glioma cell lines were irradiated with dosages from 0-8 Gy and treated with CD95L (CD95 ligand). CD95 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Caspase activity was determined by DEVD cleavage. Cytotoxic effects were assessed by crystal violet staining of cells in a 96-well plate assay. Clonogenic cell death was determined by a standard colony forming assay.RESULTS: We find that (i) CD95L-induced apoptosis, but not irradiation-induced clonogenic cell death, involves caspase 3 activation and is blocked by the viral caspase inhibitor, crm-A. (ii) Irradiation does not modulate CD95 expression either in p53 wild-type or in p53 mutant glioma cell lines, and does not enhance CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity or CD95L-induced clonogenic cell death.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that endogenous CD95/CD95L interactions are not involved in radiation-induced clonogenic cell death and that the killing cascades of CD95L and irradiation are independent in human malignant glioma cells.",Excluded
90,"The future of intraoperative neuromonitoring in skull base surgery: Intraoperative flash visual evoked potentials a novel technique aiming to reduce the risk of intraoperative visual pathway injury Intraoperative optic nerve/chiasmal injury is one the most devastating unexpected outcomes that may happen to patients undergoing endoscopic skull base surgery. Additionally, one of the main goals for most endoscopic skull base surgery is visual improvement, however currently there is limited ability of intraoperative monitoring for the visual pathway. We examine a novel technique which was developed in our center for monitor the visual pathway intraoperatively using continuous flash visual evoked potentials (FVEPs). The FVEPs provide continuous monitoring of the visual pathway including the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic radiation, and visual cortex, as well as retina function. This technique has been developed at the Ottawa Hospital. Intraoperatively left then right eyes were stimulated by goggle light emitting diode (LED) stimulators (3 LEDs on each side, 640 nm peak wavelength, 10 milliseconds pulse width, 3000mCd of luminous intensity was reflected back on an angle to give uniform illumination across the whole lens, which was placed over the closed eyelids, and recording was obtained from corkscrew electrodes placed at Oz-Fz (2 cm behind Fz). The stimulus rate was 1.41Hz. 150 stimulus presentations were included in a single average. The low cut filter was <=5 Hz and the high cut filter was 100 Hz with amplifier gain 20,000 or 50,000. The total sweep time was 300 milliseconds. EEG was continuously recorded during the surgery from C4-Fz. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. Also any droop in the FVEP will be examined in relation to any intraoperative events. Any transient FVEP amplitude changes which is caused by electrocautery were excluded from the analysis. Thirty patients who had endoscopic skull base surgery had intraoperative VEP using FVEPs in addition to other neurophysiologic monitoring. Patients demographic data, co-morbidities, diagnosis, surgical approach, length of surgery, MAP, and blood loss during surgery were recorded. All patients' visual acuity and field deficits were evaluated by neuro-ophthalmologist prior to their surgery and within 30 days after their surgery. Surgical anesthesia was maintained by TIVA (Propofol/remifentanil infusion). Changes in anesthetic agents and intraoperative events (e.g., sudden blood loss, use of vasopressors .etc) were timed and recorded. The recorded FVEP and EEG were correlated to patients pre and postoperative visual fields and acuity. We found that FVEP is reproducible throughout surgery and can predict the postsurgical outcome. Additionally, we found that FVEP is transiently affected by different stages of surgery (e.g., traction on optic chiasm, dissection, etc.). Also we found boluses of propofol and electrocautery can artificially affect FVEP.",Excluded

Many agents have been used for neuroprotection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible protective role of royal jelly on radiationinduced brain damage. Design(s): In the present study, thirty-two adult male Dawley rats, 8-12 weeks of age and weighing 275+/-35 grams were randomly divided into four groups each group compressed eight animals: group 1: control (C), group 2: irradiated rats (RT), group 3: irradiated rats with oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 days (RT+RJ50), group 4: oral royal jelly 50 mg/kg per day for 7 day (RJ50). Sprague Dawley rats were irradiated with 22 Gy gamma radiation delivered to total cranium. Royal jelly was administered before and after irradiation per day for 7 days. At the seventh day of study, when rats were under ketamine anesthesia samples of brain tissues were taken and biochemical and microscopic examination after sacrification.

The dose range of X-irradiation was from 1,300 to 2,500 rads, i.e., 1,300, 1,500, 1,750, 2,000, and 2,500 rads. Eighty-six mice were used for histological examination. For microscopic examination, the mice were killed at regular postirradiation intervals between 15 and 20, 31 and 40, 41 and 50, 51 and 60, 61 and 70, 71 and 80, 81 and 90, 139 and 177 weeks. The brains were removed immediately thereafter, fixed in Bouin's solution, and embedded in paraffin. A histological examination was performed by a morphometric estimation of vascular lesions, in which the degree of the damage to the arterial system was scored in whole serial brain sections. Necrosis (encephalomalacia), atrophy, cell infiltration, and telangiectatic vascular change of the brain, caused as a result of the fibrinoid necrosis of the large arteries, were observed. Dose-dependent incidence of the fibrinoid necrosis increased between 41 and 87 weeks after irradiation. Mean score of fibrinoid necrosis increased dose dependently approximately 60 weeks after irradiation. It is suggested that scores of large vessel damage do relate to dose at 41 to 87 weeks, and can be used to quantify the vessel injury, and that fibrinoid necrosis of the large vessels may relate to the incidence of radionecrosis.",Included
1155,"Evidence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and identification of dying cells in X-ray-induced cell death in the developing brain Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of 2 Gy X-rays and were killed 6 hr later. Dying cells were characterized by extreme chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Dying cells were distributed in the primary and secondary germinal zones and in other brain regions. Among these latter, dying cells occurred in the cortical layers of the olfactory bulb, layers II-III and VIb of the neocortex, piriform and entorhinal cortex, stratum oriens and pyramidale of the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, brainstem, internal granular layer of the cerebellum, and cerebral and cerebellar white matter. Dying cells were immature cells, neurons and glial cells (including radial glia). In-situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation identified individual cells bearing fragmented DNA. Since the number of cells stained with this method was larger than the number of dying cells, as revealed with current histological techniques, it is suggested that nuclear DNA fragmentation precedes chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in X-ray-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, agarose gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA from irradiated brains showed a ""ladder"" pattern which is typical of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and endonuclease activation.",Excluded
645,"A machine learning-based survival prediction model of high grade glioma by integration of clinical and dose-volume histogram parameters Purpose: Glioma is the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults, and it causes significant morbidity and mortality, especially in high-grade glioma (HGG) patients. The accurate prognostic prediction of HGG is vital and helpful for clinicians when developing therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we propose a machine learning-based survival prediction model by analyzing clinical and dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters, to improve the performance of the risk model in HGG patients. Method(s): Eight clinical variables and 39 DVH parameters were extracted for each patient, who received radiotherapy for HGG with active follow-up. Ninety-five patients were randomly divided into training and testing cohorts, and we employed random survival forest (RSF), support vector machine (SVM), and Cox proportional hazards (CPHs) models to predict survival. Calibration plots, concordance indexes, and decision curve analyses were used to evaluate the calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility of these three models. Result(s): The RSF model showed the best performance among the three models, with concordance indexes of 0.824 and 0.847 in the training and testing sets, respectively, followed by the SVM (0.792/0.823) and CPH (0.821/0.811) models. Specifically, in the RSF model, we identified age, gross tumor volume (GTV), grade, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and D99 as important variables associated with survival. The AUCs of the testing set were 92.4%, 87.7%, and 84.0% for 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival, respectively. According to this model, HGG patients can be divided into high- and low-risk groups. Conclusion(s): The machine learning-based RSF model integrating both clinical and DVH variables is an improved and useful tool for predicting the survival of HGG patients.

1329,"Clinical and pathological changes in cerebral arteriovenous malformations after stereotactic radiosurgery failure BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is an alternative to resection of intracranial cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), while it will fail in some cases. This study aimed to evaluate the changes after stereotactic radiosurgery for AVMs.METHODS: Nineteen cases with cerebral AVMs had failure after stereotactic radiosurgery therapy. The symptoms and angiography were assessed. All patients underwent microsurgery. Pathologic examination was performed for all cases and electron microscopic examination was carried out in 6 patients.RESULTS: Seven cases had hemorrhage from 12 to 98 months after stereotactic radiosurgery, 5 had headache, 4 had refractory encephalon edema, 2 had epilepsy as a new symptom and 1 had a pressure cyst 5 years after radiosurgery. Angiography in 18 cases, 8 - 98 months after radiation therapy, demonstrated no significant changes in 5 cases, slight reduction in 9, near complete obliteration in 1 and complete obliteration in 3. An abnormal vessel was found on pathologic examination in 17 cases, even one case had obliterated in angiography. Electron microscopy examination showed vessel wall weakness, but the vessels remained open and blood circulated. One case died because of a moribund state before surgery. The other 18 cases had no new neurological deficiencies, seizure control and no hemorrhage occurred after microsurgery at an average follow-up of 3 years.CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiotherapy for AVMs should have a long period follow-up.

Mood symptoms may exacerbate these problems, however, little is known about the exact relationship between these variables. Participants and Methods: We examined a group of 87 breast cancer survivors, mean age 58.7 years, who had received diagnoses of breast cancer 2-22 years prior (mean 6.1 years). Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests that assessed intellectual function, executive function, and memory, and several self-report questionnaires that assessed mood, fatigue, and quality of life. Result(s): Pearson analyses demonstrated significant negative correlations between scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer & Brown, 1996) and the Full Scale IQ,VerbalComprehension Index, and Processing Speed Index scores of theWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III(Wechsler, 1997). BDI-II scores also showed significant negative correlations with some measures of executive function, but not with measures of memory. Analysis of variance showed that breast cancer survivors who had been treated with chemotherapy reported more symptoms of depression than individuals who had not been treated with chemotherapy, F = 9.51, p = .003. A similar pattern was not found for individuals who had been treated with radiation. Patients' history of chemotherapy and radiation treatment did not show any relationship to subsequent neuropsychological function. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that elevated mood symptoms may be related to problems in some domains of neuropsychological performance in breast cancer survivors. Individuals who had received chemotherapy appeared more likely to experience subsequent mood problems. Further investigation is needed to determine if mood changes may increase susceptibility to the cognitive deficits experienced by breast cancer survivors. Acknowledgement: Study funded by Susan G.

2208,"Hemodynamic effects of midodrine after spaceflight in astronauts without orthostatic hypotension INTRODUCTION: Orthostatic hypotension and presyncope are common and potentially serious risks for astronauts returning from space. Susceptible subjects fail to generate an adequate adrenergic response to upright posture. The alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, midodrine, may be an effective countermeasure. We tested the hypothesis that midodrine would have no negative hemodynamic effect on healthy astronauts returning from space.METHODS: Five male astronauts participated in preflight and post-flight tilt testing on a control flight as well as on the test flights, where midodrine (10 mg, orally) was administered after landing approximately 1 h before testing.RESULTS: None of these astronauts exhibited orthostatic hypotension or presyncope before or after either flight. Midodrine did not cause any untoward reactions in these subjects before or after flight; in fact, a modest beneficial effect was seen on postflight tachycardia (p = 0.036).DISCUSSION: These data show that midodrine protected against post-spaceflight increases in heart rate without having any adverse hemodynamic effects on non-presyncopal, male astronauts.

714,"Absence of radiofrequency heating from auditory implants during magnetic resonance imaging The possibility of tissue heating due to an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) or a modified cochlear implant (CI) during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was tested on a full-sized human phantom using a realistic phantom head consisting of simulated skull, brain, and muscle. Dielectric properties of the brain, muscle, and bone materials were similar to those of human tissues at 64 MHz. The body consisted of homogeneous phantom muscle enclosed in a human-shaped fiberglass shell. Thermographic and fiber-optic temperature measurements were conducted to reveal any heating. Thermograms of sagittal, frontal, and horizontal planes of the head with the ABI and CI electrodes were taken immediately before and after a 26 min MRI scan.

1785,"Dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prime candidate for image-guided radiotherapy. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences.METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system.RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded
567,"Morphological profiles of neutron and X-irradiated small intestine This paper describes the response of mouse small intestine, at several time points after treatment with neutron or X-irradiation, using doses expected to give similar effects in terms of crypt/microcolony survival. Using resin histology, the effects of radiation on the numbers of duodenal cell types and measurements of tissue areas were assessed. The results for individual parameters and for an estimate of overall damage are given in a data display, which summarises the morphological profile of the organ after both types of radiation. Damage and recovery were seen for many of the parameters studied but there was no standard response pattern applicable for all parameters. In particular, the response of individual crypt cell types could not be predicted from knowledge of the change in crypt numbers. With regard to the holistic response of the gut, neutron irradiation appeared to have caused more damage and produced more early effects than the X-irradiation. More specifically, neutron treatment led to more damage to the neuromuscular components of the wall, while X-irradiation produced early vascular changes.",Included
1374,"Field dependence study of in vivo brain (31) P MRS up to 16.4 T In vivo (31) P MRS provides a unique tool for studying bioenergetics of living organs. Although its utility has been limited by the relatively low (31) P NMR sensitivity, increasing magnetic field strength (B0 ) could significantly improve the quality and reliability of the (31) P MR spectra for biomedical research. To quantitatively understand the field dependence of in vivo (31) P MRS for brain applications, (31) P NMR sensitivity of phosphocreatine (PCr) in rat brains was measured and compared at 9.4 T and 16.4 T. Additionally, the linewidths and T1 relaxation times of PCr and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) resonances obtained from human and animal brains over a wide B0 range from 4 T, 7 T, and 9.4 T to 16.4 T were examined and their field dependences were quantified. The results indicate an approximate 1.74-fold (31) P signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain for PCr at 16.4 T compared with 9.4 T. An approximate power 1.4 dependence of (31) P SNR on B0 was concluded. Substantial improvements in spectral resolution and significantly shortened T1 values of brain PCr and ATP were observed at high/ultrahigh fields, contributing to an additional sensitivity gain and spectral improvement. In summary, the overall findings from this study suggest that in vivo (31) P MRS should greatly benefit from high/ultrahigh fields for noninvasive assessment of altered bioenergetics and metabolic processes associated with brain function and neurological diseases.",Excluded

564,"Clinical trial of blood-brain barrier disruption by pulsed ultrasound The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the delivery of systemically administered drugs to the brain. Methods to circumvent the BBB have been developed, but none are used in standard clinical practice. The lack of adoption of existing methods is due to procedural invasiveness, serious adverse effects, and the complications associated with performing such techniques coincident with repeated drug administration, which is customary in chemotherapeutic protocols. Pulsed ultrasound, a method for disrupting the BBB, was shown to effectively increase drug concentrations and to slow tumor growth in preclinical studies. We now report the interim results of an ultrasound dose-escalating phase 1/2a clinical trial using an implantable ultrasound device system, SonoCloud, before treatment with carboplatin in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The BBB of each patient was disrupted monthly using pulsed ultrasound in combination with systemically injected microbubbles. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the BBB was disrupted at acoustic pressure levels up to 1.1 megapascals without detectable adverse effects on radiologic (MRI) or clinical examination. Our preliminary findings indicate that repeated opening of the BBB using our pulsed ultrasound system, in combination with systemic microbubble injection, is safe and well tolerated in patients with recurrent GBM and has the potential to optimize chemotherapy delivery in the brain.",Excluded

The aim of study was to assess the effectiveness of the repeated cycles of PRRT in patients with disseminated and inoperable NETs. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty nine patients were included in the PRRT. Among them 16 patients (18%) were qualified for a repeated PRRT cycle due to progression of the disease. In one of the patients qualified for the repeated cycle, PRRT was used as neoadjuvant therapy. The results and side-effects of the repeated cycles of PRRT were analyzed. Result(s): Disease stabilization was observed in 10 patients 6 months after the repeated PRRT cycle and in 5 patients after 12 and 18 months. Ten of the patients who had received repeated PRRT cycles died. In the case of neoadjuvant therapy, further reduction of the tumor size was observed, enabling qualification for surgery. Clinically significant reduction in the mean values of morphological parameters was not observed. Only after 12 and 18 months the mean values of creatinine levels were higher than the normal range (only in 2 patients). Conclusion(s): The repeated cycles of PRRT did not cause a clinically significant increase of the toxicity of PRRT. The changes in kidney and blood morphology parameters were transient.

Material(s) and Method(s): All patients with single BM who underwent surgical resection followed by IFRT at our institution from 2006 to 2013 were evaluated. Local recurrence (LR)-free survival, distant failure (DF)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were determined. Analyses were performed associating clinical variables with LR and DF. Salvage approaches and toxicity of treatment for each patient were also assessed. Result(s): Median follow-up was 19.1 months. Fifty-six patients were treated with a median dose of 40.05 Gy/15 fractions with IFRT to the resection cavity. LR-free survival was 91.4%, DF-free survival was 68.4%, and OS was 77.7% at 12 months. No variables were associated with increased LR; however, melanoma histopathology and infratentorial location were associated with DF on multivariate analysis. LRs were salvaged in 5/8 patients, and DFs were salvaged in 24/29 patients. Two patients developed radionecrosis. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant IFRT is feasible and safe for well-selected patients with surgically resected single BM.

980,"Anti-inflammatory effects of tanshinone IIA on radiation-induced microglia BV-2 cells inflammatory response AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the inhibitory effects of Tanshinone II(A) on the production of proinflammation cytokines in radiation-stimulated microglia.METHODS: Microglia cells were treated with 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 Gy of irradiation or sham-irradiated in the presence or absence of 1.0 microg/mL of Tanshinone II(A). The effects of Tanshinone II(A) on radiation-induced proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction; the expression level of nuclear factor (NF-kappabeta) p65 in cytoplasm and nucleus was measured by Western blot. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy analysis were applied to detect the expression of gamma-H2AX and p65 postirradiation.RESULTS: Radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines in BV-2 cells was detectable after irradiation. Tanshinone II(A) decreased the radiation-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines. Further, Western blotting showed that Tanshinone II(A) could attenuate the nuclear translocation of (NF-kappabeta) p65 submit postirradiation. Immunofluorescence staining showed gamma-H2AX foci formation with p65 translocation into the nucleus postirradiation.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that Tanshinone II(A) exerts anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes that might be associated with the NF-kappabeta signaling pathway. It is postulated that irradiation causes immediate cellular reaction, and that double-strand breaks trigger the molecular response that leads to NF-kappabeta pathway activation.",Included
916,"Ionizing radiation induces structural and functional damage on the molecules of rat brain homogenate membranes: a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic study Humans can be exposed to ionizing radiation, due to various reasons, whose structural effects on biological membranes are not well defined. The current study aims to understand the ionizing radiation-induced structural and functional alterations in biomolecules of brain membranes using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy using rat animal models. For this purpose, 1000 cGy of ionizing radiation was specifically directed to the head of Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were decapitated after 24 h. The results revealed that the lipid-to-protein ratio decreased and that irradiation caused lipid peroxidation and increases in the amounts of olefinic =CH, carbonyl, and methylene groups of lipids. In addition, ionizing radiation induced a decrease in membrane fluidity, disordering of membrane lipids, strengthening of the hydrogen bonding of the phosphate groups of lipid head-groups, and weakening in the hydrogen bonding of the interfacial carbonyl groups of lipids. Radiation further caused significant decrements in the alpha-helix and turns, and significant increments in the beta-sheet and random coil contents in the protein structure. Hierarchical cluster analyses, performed in the whole region (3030-1000 cm(-1)), lipid (3030-2800 cm(-1)), and protein (1700-1600 cm(-1)) regions separately, successfully differentiated the control and irradiated groups of rat brain membranes and showed that proteins in the membranes are affected more than lipids from the damages induced with ionizing radiation. As a result, the current study showed that FT-IR spectroscopy can be used successfully as a novel method to monitor radiation-induced alterations on biological membranes.",Included
372,"The functional synergism of microRNA clustering provides therapeutically relevant epigenetic interference in glioblastoma MicroRNA deregulation is a consistent feature of glioblastoma, yet the biological effect of each single gene is generally modest, and therapeutically negligible. Here we describe a module of microRNAs, constituted by miR-124, miR-128 and miR-137, which are co-expressed during neuronal differentiation and simultaneously lost in gliomagenesis. Each one of these miRs targets several transcriptional regulators, including the oncogenic chromatin repressors EZH2, BMI1 and LSD1, which are functionally interdependent and involved in glioblastoma recurrence after therapeutic chemoradiation. Synchronizing the expression of these three microRNAs in a gene therapy approach displays significant anticancer synergism, abrogates this epigenetic-mediated, multi-protein tumor survival mechanism and results in a 5-fold increase in survival when combined with chemotherapy in murine glioblastoma models. These transgenic microRNA clusters display intercellular propagation in vivo, via extracellular vesicles, extending their biological effect throughout the whole tumor.

294,"Primary central nervous system lymphomas PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B cell lymphoma that occurs in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. Primary ocular lymphoma represents an important variant of this disease. The outcome for patients with PCNSL is rapidly improving with new treatment strategies. This review focuses on recent advances, investigations, and controversies in the management of these increasingly important malignancies.RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of PCNSL is rising in immunocompetent patients over the age of 60 years for unexplained reasons. However, the incidence of AIDS-related PCNSL, which is related to Epstein-Barr virus infections, has fallen with the institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy. During the past decade, standard therapy has evolved from cranial irradiation to high dose methotrexate-based regimens. This shift in therapy has been associated with an increase in the median survival of patients from 1 year to longer than 3 years, and with an equally striking reduction in neurotoxicity if whole brain radiation is avoided. Optimal therapeutic results require careful attention to opportunistic infections, thromboembolic disease, and renal toxicities associated with high dose methotrexate.SUMMARY: Overall, PCNSLs are increasing in frequency and the results of therapy for this disease have dramatically improved during the past decade. Many important therapeutic questions remain unanswered. These include the optimal dose, frequency, and duration of methotrexate, as well as the roles of additional systemic chemotherapy drugs, intrathecal therapy, and cranial irradiation. Further progress in this uncommon disease will depend on entering patients into carefully designed multicenter clinical trials to build upon the significant advances that have been made.

375,"[Effects of parabolic flight on redox status in SH-SY5Y cells] Space flight is known to produce a number of neurological disturbances. The etiology is unknown, but it may involve increased oxidative stress. A line of experimental evidence indicates that space flight may disrupt antioxidant defense system and result in increased oxidative stress. In vitro studies found that abundant of NO was produced in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and protein nitration was increased in PC12 cells within a simulated microgravity rotating wall bioreactor high aspect ratio vessel system or clinostat system. In the present study, we observed the change of redox status in SH-SY5Y cells after parabolic flight, and studied the effects of key redox molecule, thioredoxin (TRX), during the altered gravity. SH-SY5Y cells were divided into four groups: control cells, control cells transfected with TRX, flight cells and flight cells transfected with TRX. The expression levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TRX and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR) were observed by immunocytochemical method. It was shown that after parabolic flight, the staining of 3-NT and TRX were enhanced, while the expression level of TRXR was down-regulated compared with control. As for flight cells transfected with TRX, the staining of 3-NT and iNOS were weakened compared with flight cells. These results obtained suggest that altered gravity may increase protein nitration, down-regulate TRXR and elicit oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells, while TRX transfection could partly protect cells against oxidative stress induced by parabolic flight.",Excluded
1813,"[Late radiation changes after small volume radiosurgery of the rat brain. Measuring local cerebral blood flow and histopathological studies] BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate late effects following stereotactic single fraction and small volume irradiation on cerebral blood flow and histologic alterations in the rat brain parenchyma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 Copenhagen rats, separated into eleven groups of six animals each received single doses of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 Gy using a 15 MV linear accelerator. Six rats served as controls. Two cylindrical collimators of 2 mm and 3 mm aperture were used. The diameters of the spherical 80% isodose were 3.7 and 4.7 mm, respectively (Table 1). Irradiation was applied to a predefined area in the right frontal lobe. 19 months after irradiation local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method in one animal of each dose group between 20 and 50 Gy. 9 and 19 months after irradiation, half of the animals of each group were sacrificed for brain histology. All animals irradiated with 100 Gy were sacrificed 7 months after irradiation.RESULTS: An increase of local cerebral blood flow was measured in brain structures within the 80% isodose in animals irradiated with 50 Gy (Figure 3) compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Measurements close to necrotic areas showed a strong decrease of local cerebral blood flow (Figure 1). A volume increase of the irradiated hemisphere was seen after 19 months (Figure 2). The histologic examination after 19 months showed necrotic areas in the 30-50 Gy groups (Figure 4b) but not in the 20 Gy groups (Figure 4c). The animals who received 100 Gy demonstrated brain necrosis within 9 months after irradiation (Figure 4a). At both points in time the groups irradiated with the 3-mm collimator showed more pronounced histomorphologic and functional changes compared to the groups irradiated with the 2-mm collimator.CONCLUSION: Alterations of the local cerebral blood flow were measured as a late effect after single dose irradiation. The alterations of the local cerebral blood flow could be explained by the histomorphologic changes of the blood vessels. Using a semi-quantitative classification a dose, time and volume dependence for the endpoint radionecrosis was seen.",Included

As a result of the examination, 603 persons (54.6%) made up a group at greater risk for cerebrovascular insufficiency. Arterial hypertension was found to be the leading risk factor while the age 45-49 years turned out most dangerous from the standpoint of the onset of the diseases under consideration. No relationship was established between the total dose of external radiation and the risk of the development of cerebrovascular disorders. 96 persons at greater risk for CVD were subjected to a thorough clinical and instrumental examination.

Mean follow-up was 40.9 +/- 33.8 months (48.5 +/- 36.7 months in surviving patients). 9/27 patients were included after prior treatment elsewhere (5 after intralesional resections and 4 local recurrences). The lesions were staged IB in 8/27 patients, IIB in 17/27 and III in 2/27. Immediate amputations were performed in 7/27 patients. 15/27 patients were subjected to radiation therapy (preoperative in 6/15 cases), 8/27 patients received chemotherapy (5/8 preoperatively). Result(s): Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 y was 63.0% and 59.5%. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients. 8/27 patients developed metastatic disease after 28.9 +/- 9.8 months. Survival (p = 0.397) and disease-free survival (p = 0.113) did not differ in patients after amputations vs limb salvage. Application of radiation therapy was associated with a better survival (p = 0.003). Complications related to the surgical intervention were recorded in 2/27 patients, complications related to radiation therapy occurred in 6/15 patients. Discussion(s): Despite being extra-compartmental, popliteal sarcomas can be treated with a high rate of limb salvage while equal safety compared to amputations is maintained. Irradiation improved survival in our patient population.

810,"Depleted and natural uranium: chemistry and toxicological effects Depleted uranium (DU) is a by-product from the chemical enrichment of naturally occurring uranium. Natural uranium is comprised of three radioactive isotopes: (238)U, (235)U, and (234)U. This enrichment process reduces the radioactivity of DU to roughly 30% of that of natural uranium. Nonmilitary uses of DU include counterweights in airplanes, shields against radiation in medical radiotherapy units and transport of radioactive isotopes. DU has also been used during wartime in heavy tank armor, armor-piercing bullets, and missiles, due to its desirable chemical properties coupled with its decreased radioactivity. DU weapons are used unreservedly by the armed forces. Chemically and toxicologically, DU behaves similarly to natural uranium metal. Although the effects of DU on human health are not easily discerned, they may be produced by both its chemical and radiological properties. DU can be toxic to many bodily systems, as presented in this review. Most importantly, normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, and heart can be affected by DU exposure. Numerous other systems can also be affected by DU exposure, and these are also reviewed. Despite the prevalence of DU usage in many applications, limited data exist regarding the toxicological consequences on human health. This review focuses on the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and toxicological effects of depleted and natural uranium on several systems in the mammalian body.

2163,"First in Human Clinical Trial of a Metalloporphyrin Dual Radioprotectant and Radiosensitizer, BMX-001, in Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Glioma Undergoing Concurrent Chemoradiation Purpose/Objective(s): The metalloporphyrin, BMX-001 (MnTnBuOE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>), uniquely protects normal tissues from radiation damage and sensitizes tumor cells to radiation damage. We demonstrated this dual action in preclinical models where it protected white matter from radiation damage but augmented radiation-induced cell kill in human glioblastoma (GBM) xenografts. Therefore, we performed a phase 1 study to evaluate safety of BMX-001 in newly diagnosed patients with HGG receiving concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). Materials/Methods: This clinical trial was an IRB-approved, phase 1, single-center, dose-escalation study of BMX-001 in combination with concurrent RT (daily fractions of 1.8-2 Gy to a total of 59.4-60 Gy) and TMZ (75 mg/m2 daily X 42 days). We delivered BMX-001 via subcutaneous injection at a loading dose before the start of RT/TMZ and then 2 times/week for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and neurocognition. We defined progression-free survival and overall survival as survival from time of first BMX-001 injection until progression and death, respectively, and calculated both based on Kaplan-Meier analyses. Result(s): There were 15 evaluable subjects in the phase 1 study that received all planned BMX-001 doses. All 15 subjects had GBM (WHO grade IV) with age range of 19 to 80 years. BMX-001 at 28 mg loading dose and 14 mg subsequent dose was the MTD. Sinus tachycardia (grade 3) was the dose-limiting toxicity at 42 mg loading dose (n=1). The only other related grade >= 3 event was hypotension (grade 3, n=1). The most common related toxicity was grade 1 injection site reaction (n=7). Median follow-up time was 20.5 months (95% CI: 8.9, -). Progression-free survival was 7.1 months (95% CI: 3.9, 11.4). Overall survival was 23.4 months (95% CI: 11.2, 25.9) with seven GBM patients still alive at the time of this analysis. At time of this analysis, long-term results of neurocognition are pending. Conclusion(s): BMX-001 was safe to administer during concurrent chemoradiation in newly diagnosed HGG. Early results of survival analyses are promising, and long-term neurocognitive protection remains to be determined. Thus, we launched a multi-institutional Phase 2 study with BMX-001 in combination with concurrent chemoradiation in newly diagnosed HGG with key endpoints including overall survival and neurocognition and exploratory endpoints examining white matter integrity and health-related quality of life.

2673,"Direct oral anticoagulants in patients with cancer Introduction Cancer patients are at high risk for morbidity and mortality due to thrombosis and bleeding, in addition they may also have pre-existing conditions, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and prior venous thromboembolism (VTE), for which chronic anticoagulation may be indicated. Historically, warfarin was the most commonly prescribed anticoagulant for stroke prevention in AF patients. Since 2010, the US FDA has approved 4 alternative direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) - dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF. There is limited literature to support the use of DOACs in cancer patients, but they are being prescribed by medical professionals nonetheless. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the DOACs in cancer patients, to quantify their bleeding risks, and to identify patients that are more likely to benefit from these new medications in comparison to warfarin. Large randomized clinical trials of DOACs compared to warfarin in cancer patients have not been performed. Our aim was to determine the effectiveness and associated risk of DOACs vs. warfarin in a large, real-world population of cancer patients with AF. Methods We identified 532,743 AF patients initiating oral anticoagulant use in 2010-2014 continuously enrolled in MarketScan databases. We selected 41,036 cancer patients with inpatient or outpatient ICD9 code 140.x-172.x and 174.x-209.x (excluded 173.x, non-melanoma skin cancer), and then identified a subset of cancer patients being actively treated at the time of anticoagulant initiation. Active cancer patients were defined by the use of chemotherapy, radiation therapy or cancer surgery within 6 months prior to the start of anticoagulation. Patients were categorized according to the first anticoagulant prescribed after AF diagnosis. DOAC users were matched with warfarin users by age (+/-3 years), sex, enrollment date (90 days), and anticoagulant initiation date (90 days). Study endpoints, including ischemic stroke, severe bleeding (intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding), other bleeding (genitourinary bleeding, hemopericardium, hemarthrosis, epistaxis, hemoptysis and unspecified hemorrhage) and VTE were identified using inpatient diagnostic codes, and VTE was additionally identified from 2 outpatient diagnostic codes within the same year. Cox proportional hazards models were used to access the association between type of anticoagulant and outcomes adjusting for high-dimensional propensity score, age, sex, CHA DS -VASc score, and the prevalent outcome. Results The demographic profile of the patients included in the analysis are depicted in Table 1, and Table 2 summarizes the outcomes data. In this analysis there were 6,075 cancer patients with AF who were on DOACs (rivaroxaban 2808, dabigatran 2189, and apixaban 1078) compared to 10,021 on warfarin, with a mean age of 74 years, and a mean follow-up time of 1 year. Approximately 40% of the patients were woman, and breast cancer was the most common cancer in each cohort. We found that for rivaroxaban and dabigatran users, the adjusted hazard ratios for severe bleeding was non significantly different to warfarin users, however, apixaban users had a lower risk of severe bleeding compared to warfarin users, with a hazard ratio 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.79, p=0.01). The risk of other bleeding was lower in dabigatran users compared to warfarin users with a hazard ratio 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.41-0.84, p=0.003). The risk of ischemic stroke did not differ significantly amongst different anticoagulant users. Each of the DOACs was superior to warfarin in lowering the risk of incident VTE, with p values < 0.0001. Conclusion Based on this analysis the DOACs seem to be well tolerated in cancer patients in regard to the management of atrial fibrillation, with lower or similar rates of bleeding and stroke compared to warfarin users. Importantly, the DOAC users had a significantly lower risk of incident VTE. Given that VTE ev nts contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, prescription of DOACs in place of warfarin can be considered in cancer patients with AF, while we are awaiting prospective data from randomized trials.

Purpose/Objective(s): Spinal bone metastases associated with soft tissue disease (ST) are frequently considered at higher risk of developing further complications such as neuropathic pain and cord compression. The objectives of our study were to describe the prevalence of ST in patients presenting for spine radiation therapy (XRT), and whether presence of soft tissue disease is associated with a difference in treatment approach compared with those whose do not (nST). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of all consecutive patients receiving spine XRT within our palliative radiation program during 2012. Patient demographics, symptoms intensity, performance status and life expectancy were captured at the time of consultation. Diagnostic imaging including CT +/- MRI as well as planning CT relevant to the course of treatment were reviewed to document whether ST, cord compression (CC) or compression fracture (CF) was present at the levels being irradiated. Whether a field based or volume based approach was employed by the radiation oncologist to define the treatment plan was recorded. Binary logistic regression was used for inferences, using the generalized estimating equation approach to adjust the standard error to account for the correlation of observations within a patient. Result(s): One hundred fifty patients receiving 177 treatments were reviewed. This included 19 patients receiving simultaneous treatment to 2 separate sites and 4 patients receiving treatment to 3 sites. The mean age was 64 years. 71% (106/150) of patients in both groups were estimated to have a life expectancy of over 6 months. Fifty-five percent of treatments given were in the lumbosacral area. Nocomplicating radiological features (i.e., noST, CC, CF) was present in 89/177 (50%) of cases. ST was present in 50/177 cases [28% [95% CI 25-32%)]. Of these,32%(16/50) also had aCCand 32%(16/50) had aCF. There were no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex distribution and source of primary. The proportion of patients with severe pain (>5 on a scale of 0-10) was 46% ST and 60% nST (p = 0.82). Volume based planning was employed for 58% ST and 48% nST. Fractionated treatments (mostly 20 Gy/ 5 fractions) were employed in 84% ST and 66% nST of cases. After adjustment for CC and CF, there was a trend to suggest physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated treatments in cases with ST (p =0.16). Conclusion(s): Fifty percent of treatment courses delivered to spine were associated with some complicating radiological features including ST, SC or CF. ST was present in 28% cases. We were unable to identify any clinical features that would predict for the presence of ST disease. There is a trend that physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated radiation therapy when ST was present.",Excluded

2316,"A High Affinity Red Fluorescence and Colorimetric Probe for Amyloid beta Aggregates A major challenge in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) is its timely diagnosis. Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates have been proposed as the most viable biomarker for the diagnosis of AD. Here, we demonstrate hemicyanine-based benzothiazole-coumarin (TC) as a potential probe for the detection of highly toxic Abeta42 aggregates through switch-on, enhanced (~30 fold) red fluorescence (Emax = 654 nm) and characteristic colorimetric (light red to purple) optical outputs. Interestingly, TC exhibits selectivity towards Abeta42 fibrils compared to other abnormal protein aggregates. TC probe show nanomolar binding affinity (Ka = 1.72 x 10(7) M(-1)) towards Abeta42 aggregates and also displace ThT bound to Abeta42 fibrils due to its high binding affinity. The Abeta42 fibril-specific red-shift in the absorption spectra of TC responsible for the observed colorimetric optical output has been attributed to micro-environment change around the probe from hydrophilic-like to hydrophobic-like nature. The binding site, binding energy and changes in optical properties observed for TC upon interaction with Abeta42 fibrils have been further validated by molecular docking and time dependent density functional theory studies.",Excluded
1104,"Patterns of care for patients with small cell lung cancer: A survey of German radiation oncology institutions on recommendations for prophylactic cranial irradiation Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC was first proposed in 1973 and is recommended for patients demonstrating good response to initial therapy. The general pattern of care amongst radiation oncologists in Germany has not been previously evaluated.We conceptualized and conducted this survey to assess patterns of care. Method(s): We surveyed radiation oncology institutions in Germany via an online questionnaire sent by e-mail to member institutions of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO e.V.). The questions were based on respondent and treatment characteristics with emphasis on prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited- and extensive-stage SCLC. Result(s):We receivedatotal of95responses (29%response rate). Of which 64were completed and returned and hence eligible for evaluation. Sixty-one percent of respondents were between the ages of 50-59, 88%with over 15 years of experience in the management of lungmalignancies. Sixtysevenpercent of the institutions stage theirpatients initially with 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Of the 64 responses, 97% recommended deliveryofPCI in therapy responders with LS-SCLC compared to 67% with ES-SCLC. Interestingly, a quarter of respondents offered hippocampal-avoidance PCI with only 38% following their patients with serial brain imaging followingPCI.Neuropsychological testingwas generally not routinely performed. Conclusion(s): German radiation oncology institutions showed interesting variations in certain aspects yet in general congruence in SCLC management and PCI delivery in accordance with the updated national and international guidelines. Future randomized clinical trials will further reduce discrepancies regarding delivery of PCI especially in ES-SCLC.",Excluded

The head of 15 healthy male subjects was unilaterally exposed for 30 min prior to sleep to a pulse-modulated EMF (GSM handset like signal) with a 10 g-averaged peak spatial specific absorption rate of (1) 0.2 W kg(-1), (2) 5 W kg(-1), or (3) sham exposed in a double-blind, crossover design. During exposure, subjects performed two series of three computerized cognitive tasks, each presented in a fixed order [simple reaction time task, two-choice reaction time task (CRT), 1-, 2-, 3-back task]. Immediately after exposure, night-time sleep was polysomnographically recorded for 8 h. Sleep architecture was not affected by EMF exposure. Analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a dose-dependent increase of power in the spindle frequency range in non-REM sleep. Reaction speed decelerated with increasing field intensity in the 1-back task, while accuracy in the CRT and N-back task were not affected in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, this study reveals first indications of a dose-response relationship between EMF field intensity and its effects on brain physiology as demonstrated by changes in the sleep EEG and in cognitive performance.",Excluded
3212,"Passive avoidance learning and memory of 56Fe sham-irradiated and irradiated human apoE transgenic mice Cranial irradiation is associated with long-term cognitive impairments, including deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Not all people exposed to cranial radiation develop cognitive injury, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. There may also be sex differences in susceptibility to develop radiation-induced cognitive injury. The three major human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms are encoded by distinct alleles (epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4). Compared with epsilon3, epsilon4 increases the risk of cognitive impairments following various challenges while epsilon2 provides relative protection. Women are at higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men, particularly those carrying epsilon4. In previous experiments using male and female mice expressing human apoE-isoforms E2, E3 or E4 under the mouse apoE promoter, we showed that cranial irradiation with 137Cs (10 Gy) results in hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments that are sex- and apoE-isoform dependent. 137Cs is a form of irradiation often used in the clinical setting. To investigate whether 56Fe irradiation also has sex- and apoE-isoform dependent effects on hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in human apoE mice, we sham-irradiated and irradiated 2-month old male and female human apoE mice at 3 Gy and assessed their performance in a passive avoidance learning and memory test three to five months later.",Included

Leukemia cell sensitization to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation is achieved by upregulation of ROS production and/or downregulation of antioxidative enzymes. Therefore, our aim was to analyze the potential role of fullerenol nanoparticle in modulation of the leukemic cellular response to irradiation. We used the qRT-PCR to analyze the expression level of mRNA for 11 genes in irradiated (IR) and FNP pre-treated irradiated cells (FNP + IR) K562 cells, and compared gene expression level with the overall cell survival, determined by DET and MTT assays. Interesting result of similar percentage of cell survival in FNP and FNP + IR groups (67.9% versus 63%), indicated the possible protective effect of FNP in irradiated cells. Under oxidative stress induced by radiation, cytoprotective genes such as GSTA4, MnSOD, NOS, CAT and HO-1 were upregulated in FNP pretreated K562 cells in comparison with control group, IR and FNP - treated non-irradiated cells. Amongst the antioxidative enzymes, only the mRNA of Cu, Zn - SOD (SOD-1) was downregulated, while gGT, GPX and GSTP1 were not significantly modulated in FNP-treated irradiated cells. Together with survival data and significant overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL genes, our results may indicate that FNP exerts cytoprotective function in K562 leukemic cells, rendering K562 cells more tolerant to radiotherapy.",Excluded

1470,"Time course of photo-induced Egr-1 expression in the hypothalamus of a seasonally breeding songbird Many seasonally-breeding species use daylength to time reproduction. Light-induced release of progonadal hormones involves a complex cascade of responses both inside and outside the brain. In this study, we used induction of early growth response 1 (Egr-1), the protein product of an immediate early gene, to evaluate the time course of such responses in male white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) exposed to a single long day. Induction of Egr-1 in the pars tuberalis began ~11h after dawn. This response was followed ~6h later by dramatic induction in the tuberal hypothalamus, including in the ependymal cells lining the third ventricle. At approximately the same time, Egr-1 was induced in dopaminergic and vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons in the tuberal hypothalamus and in dopaminergic neurons of the premammillary nucleus. We noted no induction in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons until 2h after dawn the following morning. Overall, our results indicate that Egr-1 responses in GnRH neurons occur rather late during photostimulation, compared with responses in other cell populations, and that such induction may reflect new synthesis related to GnRH depletion rather than stimulation by light cues.",Excluded
2247,"Muscle injury following experimental intraoperative irradiation The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Included

Method(s): The data of 1,771 patients were retrospectively analyzed using the dose management software, ontiTM (RYUKYU-ISG, Kyoto, Japan). The injection dose was fixed to 240 MBq for 846 patients and that was adjusted to 3.7 MBq/kg-body weight for 925 patients. Image quality was evaluated by noise equivalent countdensity (NECdensity) calculated excluding the counts of brain and bladder. Exposure dose was obtained using the rate of 0.019 mSv/MBq based on the report in ICRP publication 106. NECdensity and radiation exposure dose of the fixed and adjusted groups of patients were compared. Result(s): The optimization of injection dose changed the injection dose, NECdensity and radiation exposure dose from 239.9 +/- 6.83 MBq, 0.39 +/- 0.1 and 4.56 mSv to 213.0 +/- 39.9 MBq, 0.42 +/- 0.2 and 4.04 mSv, respectively. The adjustment of injection dose by body weight statistically significantly improved of image quality evaluated using NECdensity and radiation exposure dose by 8% and 11%, respectively (p<0.001).

METHOD(S): Between December 1993 and January 2000, 47 patients with vestibular schwannomas were treated at our center with gamma knife radiosurgery. The marginal tumor doses ranged from 7.5 to 14.0 Gy (median, 12.0 Gy) for patients treated after microsurgery and from 10.0 to 15.0 Gy (median, 12.0 Gy) for patients in whom radiosurgery was the primary treatment. The median maximum tumor diameter was 18 mm (range, 3-50 mm). Evaluation included audiometry, neurological examination, and serial imaging tests. A survey was conducted at the time of analysis. RESULT(S): Follow-up data were available for 45 patients and ranged from 1 to 7 years (median, 3.6 yr). In 43 patients (96%), tumor control (no radiographic progression or surgical resection) was observed. All 33 previously untreated patients had tumor control. Transient facial weakness, experienced in two patients (4%), had resolved completely within 6 months. No patient developed trigeminal neuropathy. Hearing was diminished from baseline in 12% of patients with useful hearing (Gardner-Robertson Class III). However, all patients with pretreatment hearing Gardner-Robertson Class I or II maintained testable hearing (Class I to III) at the most recent examination. CONCLUSION(S): Low-dose radiosurgery in this series provided comparable local control and decreased incidences of complications in relation to other reports.

All patients with RUF initially underwent diverting colostomy (six cystoprostatectomy with closure of the fistula, omental interposition and urinary diversion; one prostatectomy, bladder neck closure, fistula closure with omentum flap and continent vesicostomy). Three patients had the fistula closed with gracilis muscle flap using the York-Mason approach (one had a bladder neck closure and suprapubic tube; one elected to have no treatment). All patients with BNC had received three or more procedures to resect or incise their contracture. Four had diversion with a catheterizable segment, two used an indwelling Foley catheter and one uses intermittent catheterization.RESULTS: All six patients who had cystoprostatectomy with urinary diversion have had no recurrence of their RUF. All three treated with the York-Mason procedure healed well. One developed recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma and two a secondary neoplasia in the prostate or rectum (leiomyosarcoma and neuroendocrine, respectively). The enterocystoplasty patient developed sepsis after colostomy reversal and subsequently died. In those patients with BNC, the four who underwent urinary diversion fared well; two tolerate the indwelling catheter poorly, and the seventh uses intermittent catheterization with occasional difficulty.CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy with or without external irradiation can be associated with severe complications. RUF managed with aggressive anterior pelvic exenteration and urinary diversion can be associated with excellent results. The York-Mason procedure in patients with an adequate urinary continence mechanism and bladder dynamics may provide good functional results. The presence of a secondary malignancy in patients deserves further investigation. Many recurrences of a BNC tend be refractory to transurethral resection/incision; indwelling catheters are then poorly tolerated and patients may require a major reconstructive procedure.",Excluded
1641,"Tissue slice cultures from humans or rodents: a new tool to evaluate biological effects of heavy ions The aim of this interdisciplinary project is to establish slice culture preparations from rodents and humans as a new model system for studying effects of X-rays and heavy ions within normal and tumor tissues. The advantage of such slice cultures relies on the conservation of an organotypic environment, the easy treatment and observation by live-imaging microscopy, and the independence from genetic immortalization strategies used to generate cell lines. Rat brains as well as human tumors were cut into 300-mum-thick sections and cultivated in an incubator in a humidified atmosphere at 37 degrees C. This is realized by a membrane-based culture system with a liquid-air interface. With this system, it is possible to keep rodent slices viable for several months. Human brain tumor slices remained vital for at least 21 days. Slices were irradiated with X-rays at the radiation facility of the University Hospital in Frankfurt/Main at doses up to 40 Gy.

2478,"Acute impairment of saccadic eye movement is associated with cerebral infarction after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage Introduction Cerebral infarction due to delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Damage to the brain in the first 72 hours (""early brain injury"") is likely to play a key pathophysiological role but remains difficult to quantify objectively and noninvasively at the bedside-especially in those patients who do not require sedation or ventilation. Current diagnostic modalities used in routine clinical practice are either invasive, require ionising radiation or contrast or have a high learning curve and user variability. Objectives We sought to determine whether saccadic eye movements are impaired following SAH and whether measurement of saccadic latency (SL) in the acute period post-aneurysm rupture is associated with the likelihood of developing DCI in patients after SAH. Methods 24 male/female patients (mean age 53.32, range 31-70) with World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) grade I and II aneurysmal SAH, treated endovascularly within 72 hours of rupture were recruited. DCI and DCI-related cerebral infarction were defined as per consensus guidelines.1 Saccadometry data was collected at three time points: In the first 72 hours, between days 5 and 10 and at three months post-SAH. Data from 10 healthy age/gender matched controls was collected on one occasion for comparison. Results Age-adjusted median SL in patients was significantly prolonged in the first 72 hours post-SAH when compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 160.7, 95 % CI = (145.6, 179.4)ms, p = 0.0054 f-test). By 3 months post-SAH, there was no significant difference in median SL compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 180.0, 95 % CI = (165.1, 197.8)ms, p = 0.4175 f-test). Patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction due to DCI had a significantly higher age-adjusted median SL in the first 72 hours than those without infarction (240.6, 95 % CI = (216.7, 270.3)ms v 204.1, 95 % CI = (190.7, 219.5)ms, p = 0.0157 t-test). This difference was more pronounced during days 5-10 post-SAH-the peak incidence for DCI (303.7, 95 % CI = (266.7 352.7)ms v 207.6, 95 % CI = (193.7, 223.6)ms, p < 0.0001 t-test). A binary generalised linear model showed that median SL in the first 72 hours was the only significant predictor of cerebral infarction after SAH. Conclusions This is the first study to use saccadometry to measure eye movements in patients with SAH during the acute period post-rupture. Results show that median saccadic latency in the first 72 hours following SAH is an independent predictor of the risk of developing cerebral infarction due to DCI. Saccadometry may act as a potential objective biomarker of early brain injury to guide the need for intensive care admission and treatment. [Table Presented].",Excluded

In particular, we have developed and characterized two optoXRs that selectively recruit distinct, targeted signalling pathways in response to light. The two optoXRs exerted opposing effects on spike firing in nucleus accumbens in vivo, and precisely timed optoXR photostimulation in nucleus accumbens by itself sufficed to drive conditioned place preference in freely moving mice.

By combining this with measurements of the mean free path of the excitation light, adaptive optics and vector-based modeling that includes phase modulation and scattering, we show that tissue-induced wavefront distortions are the main determinant of enlargement and distortion of the PSF2p at intermediate imaging depths. Furthermore, they generate surrounding lobes that contain more than half of the 2P excitation. These effects reduce the resolution of fine structures and contrast and they, together with scattering, limit 2P excitation.

Radiation doses of 11.5, 13.5, 14.3, and 17 Gy were delivered in a single dose and results were compared to previous studies using doses of 15 and 30 Gy. Brain injury was quantified using computed tomography (CT), with serial studies obtained monthly up to 1 year following irradiation. Quantitative endpoints included low density volume and contrast enhancement. Doses above 14.3 Gy resulted in high lethality 5-8 months following irradiation, and an LD50 of 14.9 Gy was calculated. At these lethal doses, low density volume representing edema, demyelination, and necrosis had a similar response with an ED50 of 14.6 Gy. Radiation-induced decreases in white matter density appeared 5-6 months after sublethal doses (less than or equal to 14.3 Gy) and the volume of tissue characterized by this low density increased with time and dose. This sublethal low density change had an ED50 of 12.8 Gy, and may reflect a loss or generalized atrophy of glial cells and/or myelin. These results show that: (a) the dose response curves obtained after hemibrain x-irradiation are extremely steep; and (b) at least two processes may be involved in the development of late radiation damage, one that is rapid upon onset (a ""delayed acute"" reaction) and the other which is a slower and more degenerative process.",Included

12,"CT perfusion in acute ischemic stroke: a comparison of 2-second and 1-second temporal resolution BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT perfusion data sets are commonly acquired using a temporal resolution of 1 image per second. To limit radiation dose and allow for increased spatial coverage, the reduction of temporal resolution is a possible strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of reduced temporal resolution in CT perfusion scans with regard to color map quality, quantitative perfusion parameters, ischemic lesion extent, and clinical decision-making when using DC and MS algorithms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: CTP datasets from 50 patients with acute stroke were acquired with a TR of 1 second. Two-second TR datasets were created by removing every second image. Various perfusion parameters (CBF, CBV, MTT, TTP, TTD) and color maps were calculated by using identical data-processing settings for 2-second and 1-second TR. Color map quality, quantitative region-of-interest-based perfusion measurements, and TAR/NVT lesions (indicated by CBF/CBV mismatch) derived from the 2-second and 1-second processed data were statistically compared.RESULTS: Color map quality was similar for 2-second versus 1-second TR when using DC and was reduced when using MS. Regarding quantitative values, differences between 2-second and 1-second TR datasets were statistically significant by using both algorithms. Using DC, corresponding tissue-at-risk lesions were slightly smaller at 2-second versus 1-second TR (P < .05), whereas corresponding NVT lesions showed excellent agreement. With MS, corresponding tissue-at-risk lesions showed excellent agreement but more artifacts, whereas NVT lesions were larger (P < .001) compared with 1-second TR. Therapeutic decisions would have remained the same in all patients.CONCLUSIONS: CTP studies obtained with 2-second TR are typically still diagnostic, and the same therapy would have been provided. However, with regard to perfusion quantitation and image-quality-based confidence, our study indicates that 1-second TR is preferable to 2-second TR.",Excluded

After symptomatic treatment on the intensive care unit all symptoms were completely reversible.CONCLUSION: Toxic encephalopathy is a rare but dramatic complication of various cytostatic drugs. With the widespread use of cisplatin this rare disorder should be kept in mind.",Excluded
2921,"Nephrotoxicity profiles and threshold dose values for [177Lu]-DOTATATE in nude mice INTRODUCTION: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors the main dose-limiting tissue is found in the kidneys because of tubular reabsorption and retention of radioactivity. The aim of this study was to quantify late effects in renal cortex of nude mice exposed to high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate ([(177)Lu]-DOTATATE), and to determine whether a threshold dose value exists for these findings.METHODS: Nude mice were exposed to 90, 120 or 150 MBq of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE. Renal toxicity was evaluated up to 6 months after injection. Blood samples were collected to examine renal functional markers, and after sacrifice at 6 months changes in renal morphology were explored. Tissue damage was estimated by quantifying the relative area of the different subunits in the renal cortex using point counting. Additional morphological signs of radiation damage were also noted. The absorbed doses to the kidneys were estimated by previously determined kidney pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulations for different assumptions regarding the activity distribution.RESULTS: Increased serum creatinine and urea values indicated long-term renal toxicity. The tissue area occupied by proximal tubules decreased with increasing doses of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE, whereas the other subunits in cortex slightly increased. The mean absorbed dose in the renal cortex for [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE was estimated to be 35-58 Gy for the different groups of animals. A dose-response relationship was observed for proximal tubular damage, and a threshold dose value of 24 Gy (BED 37 Gy) was determined.CONCLUSIONS: Selective morphological changes in kidney cortex of nude mice were quantified and appeared in a dose dependent manner after injection of high amounts of [(177)Lu]-DOTATATE.",Included

The decrease was maximum in 60 min. The absorption and utilization of glucose via a pentose-phosphate route and in the Krebs cycle did not substantially change. It is concluded that the energy supply of nerve cells under study is not responsible for the decrease in the ATP level.",Included

444,"Solar ultraviolet-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality in the United States, 1993-2002 BACKGROUND: An inverse relationship between solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) exposure and non-skin cancer mortality has long been reported. Vitamin D, acquired primarily through exposure to the sun via the skin, is believed to inhibit tumor development and growth and reduce mortality for certain cancers.METHODS: We extend the analysis of this relationship to include cancer incidence as well as mortality, using higher quality and higher resolution data sets than have typically been available. Over three million incident cancer cases between 1998 and 2002 and three million cancer deaths between 1993 and 2002 in the continental United States were regressed against daily satellite-measured solar UV-B levels, adjusting for numerous confounders. Relative risks of reduced solar UV-B exposure were calculated for thirty-two different cancer sites.RESULTS: For non-Hispanic whites, an inverse relationship between solar UV-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality was observed for ten sites: bladder, colon, Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, other biliary, prostate, rectum, stomach, uterus, and vulva. Weaker evidence of an inverse relationship was observed for six sites: breast, kidney, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreas, and small intestine. For three sites, inverse relationships were seen that varied markedly by sex: esophagus (stronger in males than females), gallbladder (stronger in females than males), and thyroid (only seen in females). No association was found for bone and joint, brain, larynx, liver, nasal cavity, ovary, soft tissue, male thyroid, and miscellaneous cancers. A positive association between solar UV-B exposure and cancer mortality and incidence was found for anus, cervix, oral cavity, melanoma, and other non-epithelial skin cancer.CONCLUSION: This paper adds to the mounting evidence for the influential role of solar UV-B exposure on cancer, particularly for some of the less-well studied digestive cancers. The relative risks for cancer incidence are similar to those for cancer mortality for most sites. For several sites (breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, other biliary, vulva), the relative risks of mortality are higher, possibly suggesting that the maintenance of adequate vitamin D levels is more critical for limiting tumor progression than for preventing tumor onset. Our findings are generally consistent with the published literature, and include three cancer sites not previously linked with solar UV-B exposure, to our knowledge: leukemia, small intestine, and vulva.",Excluded

1617,"Deterministic multiplicative gain control with active dendrites Multiplicative gain control is a vital component of many theoretical analyses of neural computations, conferring the ability to scale neuronal firing rate in response to synaptic inputs. Many theories of gain control in single cells have used precisely balanced noisy inputs. Such noisy inputs can degrade signal processing. We demonstrate a deterministic method for the control of gain without the use of noise. We show that a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP), arising from active dendritic spike backpropagation, leads to a multiplicative increase in gain. Reduction of DAP amplitude by dendritic inhibition dilutes the multiplicative effect, allowing for divisive scaling of the firing rate. In contrast, somatic inhibition acts in a subtractive manner, allowing spatially distinct inhibitory inputs to perform distinct computations. The simplicity of this mechanism and the ubiquity of its elementary components suggest that many cell types have the potential to display a dendritic division of neuronal output.",Excluded
3423,"ATM phosphorylation of Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein is required in a DNA damage response Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is characterized by extreme radiation sensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer. The phenotypes are similar to those of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) disease, where there is a deficiency in a protein kinase that is activated by DNA damage, indicating that the Nbs and Atm proteins may participate in common pathways. Here we report that Nbs is specifically phosphorylated in response to gamma-radiation, ultraviolet light and exposure to hydroxyurea. Phosphorylation of Nbs mediated by gamma-radiation, but not that induced by hydroxyurea or ultraviolet light, was markedly reduced in ATM cells. In vivo, Nbs was phosphorylated on many serine residues, of which S343, S397 and S615 were phosphorylated by Atm in vitro. At least two of these sites were underphosphorylated in ATM cells. Inactivation of these serines by mutation partially abrogated Atm-dependent phosphorylation. Reconstituting NBS cells with a mutant form of Nbs that cannot be phosphorylated at selected, ATM-dependent serine residues led to a specific reduction in clonogenic survival after gamma-radiation. Thus, phosphorylation of Nbs by Atm is critical for certain responses of human cells to DNA damage.",Excluded

The DATA (6-amino-1,4-diazapine-triacetate) scaffold represents a novel hybrid chelator architecture possessing both cyclic and acyclic character that may allow for facile access to <sup>68</sup>Ga-labelled tracers in the clinic. We report the first bifunctional DATA chelator conjugated to [Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotide (TOC), a somatostatin subtype 2 receptor (SST<inf>2</inf>)-targeting vector for imaging and functional characterisation of SSTR<inf>2</inf> expressing tumours. Method(s): The radiopharmaceutical precursor, DATA-TOC, was synthesised as previously described and used to complex <sup>nat</sup>Ga(III) and <sup>68</sup>Ga(III). Competition binding assays of [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC or [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC against [<sup>125</sup>I-Tyr<sup>25</sup>]LTT-SS28 were conducted in membranes of HEK293 cells transfected to stably express one of the hSST<inf>2,3,5</inf> receptor subtypes (HEK293-hSST<inf>2/3/5</inf> cells). First in vivo studies were performed in female NMRI-nude mice bearing SST<inf>2</inf>-positive mouse phaeochromocytoma mCherry (MPC-mCherry) tumours to compare the in vivo SST<inf>2</inf>-specific tumour-targeting of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC and its overall pharmacokinetics versus the [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC reference. A direct comparison of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC with the well-established PET radiotracer [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC was additionally performed in a 46-year-old male patient with a well-differentiated NET (neuroendocrine tumour), representing the first in human administration of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC. Result(s): DATA-TOC was labelled with <sup>68</sup>Ga with a radiolabelling efficiency of > 95% in less than 10 min at ambient temperature. A molar activity up to 35 MBq/nmol was achieved. The hSST<inf>2</inf>-affinities of [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC and [<sup>nat</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC were found similar with only sub-nanomolar differences in the respective IC<inf>50</inf> values. In mice, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC was able to visualise the tumour lesions, showing standardised uptake values (SUVs) similar to [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. Direct comparison of the two PET tracers in a NET patient revealed very similar tumour uptake for the two <sup>68</sup>Ga-radiotracers, but with a higher tumour-to-liver contrast for [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC. Conclusion(s): [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC was prepared, to a quality appropriate for in vivo use, following a highly efficient kit type process. Furthermore, the novel radiopharmaceutical was comparable or better than [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC in all preclinical tests, achieving a higher tumour-to-liver contrast in a NET-patient.

3411,"Clinical outcome and prognostic factors for central neurocytoma Purpose/Objective(s): Central neurocytomas are intraventricular neoplasms of the central nervous system that comprise 0.25- 0.5% of brain tumors and their optimal management remains controversial due to their rarity. We assessed clinical outcome for a historical cohort of neurocytoma patients and evaluated effects of tumor atypia, tumor size, extent of resection (EOR), and adjuvant radiation (RT). Materials/Methods: Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from date of first surgical resection. Differences in PFS were measured by Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazard ratio methods. Tumor atypia was defined as MIB-1 index >2%, focal necrosis, or microvascular proliferation, as previously established. Result(s): A total of 22 patients (14 males, 8 females) were treated between 1995 and 2009, with a median age at diagnosis of 24 years (range 11-62). A total of 8 patients experienced recurrent/progressive disease. Median follow-up by MRI was 38 month (range 0.1-183) for those who have not progressed. Overall 3-yr PFS was 70% (CI 41-86%). Only three patients died and all had atypical tumors. For the remaining patients, median follow-up for survival was 51 month (range 0.1-183). We examined effects of tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling. Ten of 22 tumors had atypical features. There was near 100% concordance between tumor atypia and MIB-1 labeling: only 1 tumor was atypical based on microvascular proliferation but had MIB-1 <= 2%. Three-year PFS was 78% for MIB labeling <= 2% and 39% for MIB labeling >2% (HR 7.7, CI 2 - 40, p = 0.016). Median tumor diameter was 4.3 cm (range 0.8-8.6 cm). Three-yr PFS was 48% (CI 21-77%) for tumor >4.3 cm and 74.1% (CI 29-93%) for tumor <=4.3 cm (HR 1.6, CI 0.5 - 6.6, p = 0.49). We examined influence of EOR and adjuvant RT. Five patients had gross total resection (GTR), and 17 had subtotal resection (STR). No patient had a biopsy only. Seven patients progressed after STR, and one patient recurred after GTR. None of the GTR patients received adjuvant RT and four of the STR patients received adjuvant RT. Three-year PFS rates by extent of resection and adjuvant RT are shown (in table below). Conclusion(s): For patients with central neurocytoma, MIB-1 labeling index >2% significantly predicts worse outcome. The additional criteria for tumor atypia did not add useful prognostic information. Although patient numbers are too small for conclusive confirmation, our data indicate that lesser EOR and larger tumors size may confer worse prognosis and adjuvant RTafter STR may improve PFS.

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 172 pathologically confirmed adult grade II-III IEPN patients from 12 institutions were eligible. Of them, 106 (61.6%) and 66 (38.4%) patients were grade II and III, respectively. For grade II and III IEPNs, 51 (48.1%) and 59 (89.4%) patients received PORT, respectively. The median dose to the primary tumor bed was 54.0 Gy and 59.4 Gy for grade II and III patients, respectively. The prognostic impact of sex, age, performance, WHO grade, location, size, surgical extent, and PORT on local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up period for survivors was 88.1 months. The 5-/10-year LC, PFS, and OS rates were 64.8%/54.0%, 56.4%/44.8%, and 76.6%/71.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, adjuvant PORT significantly improved LC (P = 0.002), PFS (P = 0.002), and OS (P = 0.043). Older age (P < 0.001), WHO grade III (P < 0.001), larger tumor size (P = 0.004), and lesser surgical extent (P < 0.001) were also negative factors for OS.

Pain relief is obtained in approximately 80% of patients. Toxicity is mild and retreatment is usually possible. External beam radiotherapy is indicated when spinal cord or nerve root compression is demonstrated, or when osteolytic metastases with danger of fracture are visualized. External radiotherapy and Strontium-89 are important treatments to palliate patients suffering from metastatic prostate cancer.

2097,"Blocking GABAA neurotransmission in the interposed nuclei: effects on conditioned and unconditioned eyeblinks The interposed nuclei (IN) of the intermediate cerebellum are critical components of the circuits that control associative learning of eyeblinks and other defensive reflexes in mammals. The IN, which represent the sole output of the intermediate cerebellum, receive massive GABAergic input from Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex and are thought to contribute to the acquisition and performance of classically conditioned eyeblinks. The specific role of deep cerebellar nuclei and the cerebellar cortex in eyeblink conditioning are not well understood. One group of studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN altered the time profile of conditioned responses (CRs), suggesting that the main function of the cerebellar cortex is to shape the timing of CRs. Other studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN abolished CRs, indicating a more fundamental involvement of the cerebellar cortex in CR generation. When examining this controversy, we hypothesized that the behavioral effect of GABA(A) blockers could be dose-dependent. The IN of classically conditioned rabbits were injected with high and low doses of picrotoxin and gabazine. Both GABA(A) blockers produced tonic eyelid closure. A high dose of both drugs abolished CRs, whereas a less complete block of GABA(A)-mediated inputs with substantially smaller drug doses shortened CR latencies. In addition, low doses of picrotoxin facilitated the expression of unconditioned eyeblinks evoked by trigeminal stimulation. These results suggest that the intermediate cerebellum regulates both associative and non-associative components of the eyeblink reflex, and that behavioral effects of blocking Purkinje cell action on IN neurons are related to collective changes in cerebellar signals and in the excitability of extra-cerebellar eyeblink circuits.",Excluded

Following exposure to aggressive treatment regimens, GBMs frequently shift their biological features upon recurrence, acquiring a more resistant phenotype. However, the dynamics and molecular mechanisms that facilitate GBM recurrence are still poorly understood. The objective our study was to determine how glioma stem cells (GSCs) temporally adjust their expression profile and phenotype in response to ionizing radiation or Temozolomide (TMZ) in vivo using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of GBM. We established two PDX GBM models by intracranially implanting two patient-derived GSC lines belonging to different GBM molecular subgroups (proneural and classical) into immunocompromised mice. The tumor-bearing mice were treated with single or multiple doses of ionizing radiation or TMZ to assess acute and long-term responses to treatment respectively. Mice from each cohort were be sacrificed at multiple distinct time points following treatment. Using immunohistochemical methods, we assessed changes in the expression of GBM subclass markers, stemness and differentiation markers, and DNA damage/repair proteins across the entire tumor population over time. Furthermore, to understand how the PDX tumors respond to radiation at a molecular level, we employed mass cytometry (CyTOF) and ChIP-seq to determine how important cellular signaling pathways and transcriptional programs necessary for GSC selfrenewal, invasion and growth are altered at various time points post-treatment. We demonstrate that GSCs undergo an immediate response following exposure to radiation that results in a global modulation of the expression of key stemness and proliferation genes under adverse conditions. Our results suggest that this acute response allows GSCs to enter a transient semi-differentiated state that favors GSC adaptability and resistance to therapy.",Excluded
3383,"Effect of gonadotropin secretion rate on the radiosensitivity of the rat luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone neuron and gonadotroph To test the hypothesis that the functional state of hypothalamic LHRH neurons and pituitary gonadotrophs might alter their radiosensitivity, we determined the experimental conditions under which the gonadotropin response to castration could be impaired by a single dose of cranial irradiation. Single doses of cranial irradiation greater than 2000 rads were lethal to unshielded rats. Shielding of the oropharynx and esophagus allowed the animals to survive doses up to 5000 rads. Doses between 2000 and 5000 rads had no effect on basal gonadotropin levels for as long as 3 months after irradiation. Irradiation caused a dose- and time-dependent impairment, however, in the gonadotropin response to castration. Impairment of the gonadotropin levels of castrate animals occurred in animals that were irradiated either before or after castration. However, rats irradiated in the castrate state showed a decreased susceptibility to irradiation damage. Additionally, stimulation of the pituitary by LHRH agonist (LHRHa) 3 h before irradiation significantly reduced the impairment of gonadotropin secretion 12-20 weeks after irradiation (P less than 0.05). Thus, increased functional activity of the rat hypothalamus or pituitary at the time of irradiation, induced by either castration or acute LHRHa administration, was associated with some protection against the gonadotropin-lowering effect of irradiation. Based upon these data, we hypothesize that stimulation of gonadotropin secretion at the time of therapeutic cranial irradiation in humans might protect against subsequent impairment of gonadotropin secretion.",Included

We have extended these studies to determine the fate of p53 in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells where constitutive p53 protein resides in the nucleus. A continuous increase in the nuclear p53 protein was observed in irradiated cells beginning 1 h after irradiation that persisted for 8 h. Surprisingly, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a transient, rapid and sensitive increase in a radiation-induced nuclear dephosphorylated p53 using antibody PAb421, which detects p53 when serine 376 is dephosphorylated. The PAb421 epitope was detectable after exposure to radiation doses as low as 0.5 cGy and was 10 to 20 times more sensitive compared to detection of p53 protein levels. The results are consistent with a radiation-induced, sensitive and rapid dephosphorylation of p53 at serine 376. The rapid increase in the nuclear PAb421 epitope was blocked by the protein serine phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A but was not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that serine 376 was dephosphorylated by protein serine phosphatase 1 or 2A acting on pre-existing p53 protein.

282,"The hippocampus in aging and disease: From plasticity to vulnerability The hippocampus has a pivotal role in learning and in the formation and consolidation of memory and is critically involved in the regulation of emotion, fear, anxiety, and stress. Studies of the hippocampus have been central to the study of memory in humans and in recent years, the regional specialization and organization of hippocampal functions have been elucidated in experimental models and in human neurological and psychiatric diseases. The hippocampus has long been considered a classic model for the study of neuroplasticity as many examples of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation and -depression have been identified and demonstrated in hippocampal circuits. Neuroplasticity is the ability to adapt and reorganize the structure or function to internal or external stimuli and occurs at the cellular, population, network or behavioral level and is reflected in the cytological and network architecture as well as in intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons and circuits. The high degree of hippocampal neuroplasticity might, however, be also negatively reflected in the pronounced vulnerability of the hippocampus to deleterious conditions such as ischemia, epilepsy, chronic stress, neurodegeneration and aging targeting hippocampal structure and function and leading to cognitive deficits.

Our experiments reveal that a single delivery of ondansetron (1 or 2 mg kg(-1)) or of granisetron (0.25 mg kg(-1)) 45-90 min before irradiation or 35-45 min after irradiation was not totally effective. Conversely, the delivery of two doses with the same delay prior to and after exposure led to a complete prevention of vomiting and retching. These observations can be explained by the dual mechanism of radiation-induced emesis: an early peripheral mechanism and a later central mechanism. Two deliveries of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists seem to disrupt serotonergic transmission at the brain stem structures and to affect the peripheral release of serotonin from the gut, thus completely preventing radiation-induced vomiting. This study confirms that the 5-HT3-dependent mechanisms that mediate emesis are similar for both neutron and gamma radiation.",Excluded

In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of irradiation in these patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 153 patients with multiple myeloma who were admitted to our department between 1989 and 2013. According to the staging system of Durie & Salmon 116 patients were classified as stage III. 107/153 patients were treated with radiotherapy of at least one and up to 6 bony lesions at different times. In order to evaluate the effect of local radiotherapy on pain relief and bone recalcification a uni- and multivariate analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model to correct for multiple measurements. Complete information on dose, fractionation and volume of radiotherapy was available from 81 patients treated in 136 target volumes for pain relief, and from 69 patients treated in 108 target volumes for recalcification. Total radiation doses varied between 8 Gy to 50 Gy (median dose 25 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions, 5 times a week).RESULTS: Radiotherapy resulted in complete local pain relief in 31% and partial local pain relief in 54% of the patients. In the univariate analysis, higher total radiation doses (p = 0.023) and higher age (p = 0.014) at the time of radiotherapy were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of pain relief, whereas no significant association was detected for concurrent systemic treatment, type and stage of myeloma and location of bone lesions. The same variables were independent predictors for pain relief in the multivariate analysis. Recalcification was observed in 48% of irradiated bone lesions. In the uni- and multivariate analysis higher radiation doses were significantly associated (p = 0.048) with an increased likelihood of recalcification. Side effects of radiotherapy were generally mild.CONCLUSIONS: Higher total biological radiation doses were associated with better pain relief and recalcification in this retrospective evaluation of multiple myeloma patients. In addition, in the elderly the therapeutic measures appear to develop a better analgesic effect.",Included

This simultaneous-treatment technique enables us to more efficiently treat two lesions concurrently when each target conforms to the radiosurgery protocol. Materials/Methods:We created a clinical reference plan (CRP), which has optimized dose coverage, conformity, homogeneity, and step-wise fall-off to zero dose.We then applied orthogonal-to-spherical coordinate system transformations about the isocenter, to each individual beam's parameters that simulated the multiple rotational errors for this research. For each patient (n = 10) 24 experimental treatment plan (ETP) calculations were. For each ETP , DVHs were computed for the two PTVs, optic nerves, optic chiasm and brainstem. From all of the DVH data, critical analytical indices were computed and compared to the CRP. These analytical indices include: Coverage, conformity, Dose Homogeneity, and Dose Gradient. A neurosurgical team evaluated the plans and subjectively evaluated the clinical suitability of each plan. The accumulated indices were scored and weighted to obtain a single value, the Unified Dosimetry Index (UDI). The UDI represents a plan's suitability vis-a-vis the CRP. Result(s): From the computed UDIs we observed that ETPs with 1-2 degrees of rotation remain within the defined range of suitability for clinical treatment. Rotation errors greater than 2 degrees resulted in UDI outside the clinically acceptable range. Conclusion(s): Isocenter rotations of 3 degrees or more significantly reduces the quality of clinical SRS treatments. Small lesions are especially vulnerable to loss of dosimetric coverage. SRS treatment setup should have a combined rotational error less than 2.5 degrees to effectively deliver the prescribed radiation dose using multiple brain lesions with mono-isocentric technique.",Excluded
1293,"A phase II trial of maintenance ADAPT therapy targeting colon cancer stem cells in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer Background: Presence of cancer stem cells (CSC) appears to be the chief cause of drug resistance to cytotoxic or targeted chemotherapy. Experimental models suggest that these resistant cancer cells undergo dormancy transition that is best targeted with a stemness modulator in its activation window through a strategy that we call ADAPT: Activating (CSC) from Dormancy And Potentiate for Targeting. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that 5FU activates while celecoxib inhibits and depletes these putative colorectal CSC. We retrospectively administer three year ADAPT therapy in unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) patients using capecitabine and celecoxib +/- radiation following maximal responses (complete (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)) to first-line combination chemotherapy. ADAPT therapy led to 30% CR and additional 10% surgical CR whose median survival reached 92.7 months in patients with unresectable MCRC. (Lin et al AACR 2010 LB-254). Method(s): Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center institutional review board (IRB) approved this prospective phase II ADAPT study funded by Gateway for Cancer Cure in October 2013. The primary endpoint is to determine the rate of CR at three years. The secondary objectives are to determine progression free survival, overall survival, and relapse free survival (if CR) based on intent to treat analysis. Forty-three unresectable MCRC patients except those with brain or bone metastases or severe bowel obstruction will be enrolled and patients must have achieved maximal response (CR, PR, or SD) to first-line chemotherapy before prior to three-year ADAPT protocol +/-radiation. Patient must not be allergic to NSAIDs or sulfonamide and aspirin is not allowed.

1434,"Carcinomatous meningitis: are surgeryand gamma knife radiosurgery treatment risk factors? OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to identify possible risk factors leading to carcinomatous meningitis in patients with a known brain metastasis and who were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS).METHODS: Two hundred eighty lesions in 101 patients were treated during 121 GKS procedures. The clinical and neuroimaging history, tumor histology, and follow-up studies were reviewed for all patients. Evidence as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging criteria and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology of carcinomatous meningitis was evaluated. The data were then analyzed to identify potential risk factors for the development of CSF dissemination.CONCLUSIONS: It appears that carcinomatous meningitis is exclusively identified in patients with adenocarcinoma, in particular with primary lung cancer. Furthermore, the incidence is higher if surgery is performed and the interval to subsequent GKS is prolonged.",Excluded
1083,"Risk factors for cerebrovascular deaths in patients operated and irradiated for pituitary tumors Vascular mortality, especially cerebrovascular disease (CVD), are the most pronounced cause of mortality in women with hypopituitarism. In a cohort of 342 patients operated and irradiated for pituitary tumors, 31 died from CVD (CVD patients) between 1952 and 1996. The study assessed whether the radiation regimens and duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation differed between the 31 CVD patients and the 62 matched patients from the same cohort who had not died from CVD (control patients). Furthermore, the infarction/hemorrhage ratio, type of clinical stroke syndrome, and time to death after stroke were investigated in the CVD patients and in matched controls from the general population who had died from CVD (population controls). No significant differences in maximum or centrally absorbed dose, maximum or central biological equivalent dose, field size, or number of fraction were recorded between CVD and control patients. A significant difference in the duration of symptoms of hypopituitarism before operation was recorded, but only in women (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the infarction/hemorrhage ratio (P > 0.3) of lacunar or posterior circulation syndrome compared with middle cerebral artery syndrome with cortical features (P = 0.22) or the proportion of patients who died within the first month after stroke onset (60% vs. 59%, respectively) between CVD patients and population controls. In conclusion, no significant effect on CVD deaths could be detected for any radiation parameter. A long history of unsubstituted pituitary insufficiency may be a contributing factor to the very high CVD mortality among women. There were no indications of significant differences in type of stroke, clinical stroke syndromes, or stroke fatality between the CVD patients and the population controls.",Excluded
2299,"MRI changes in the rat hippocampus following proton radiosurgery PURPOSE: To define radiographic dose-response relationships for proton radiosurgery using a rat brain model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A group of 23 rats was treated with Bragg peak proton beam irradiation involving the right hippocampus. Single doses of 5, 12, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 130 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) were delivered to groups of 3 animals using single fraction technique. One extra animal was included at the 130- and 30-CGE doses. Animals were imaged using a standard 1.5-tesla GE Signa MRI. A 3-inch surface coil was employed to obtain T1-weighted sagittal images (TR 600 and TE 30) and dual echo T2-weighted coronal images (TR 3,000 and TE 30/90). Animals were imaged at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6 and 9 months. Volumetric analysis with custom software was done to evaluate areas of increased signal on T2-weighted images, and signal change versus time curves were generated. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was also done at the 9-month time point to further evaluate tissue injury. The development of hydrocephalus was also examined.RESULTS: Peak tissue injury was greater and occurred earlier with higher versus lower doses of radiation. Statistically significant differences were seen between the 130- and 90-CGE animals and between the 90- and 60-CGE animals (p < 0.0016) using ANOVA. Signal changes can be seen in at least 1 of the animals at 20 CGE. The largest volume of tissue enhancement at 9 months was seen in animals at 60 CGE, which may represent an intermediate zone of tissue injury and gliosis compared with greater tissue loss at higher doses and less injury at lower doses. Hydrocephalus developed first in the untreated hemisphere in 130- and 90-CGE animals as a result of mass effect while it occurred at a later time in the treated hemisphere in lower-dose animals.CONCLUSIONS: Following single-dose proton radiosurgery of rat hippocampus, serial MRIs show T2 signal changes in animals ranging from 130 down to 20 CGE as well as the development of hydrocephalus. Dose-effect relationships using proton radiosurgery in rats will be a helpful step in guiding further studies on radiation injury to brain tissue.",Included
1875,"Low-dose radiation enhances survivin-mediated virotherapy against malignant glioma stem cells To improve the efficacy and selectivity of virotherapy for malignant glioma, we designed a strategy to amplify adenoviral replication in conjunction with radiotherapy using a radioinducible promoter. First, we compared the radiation-inducible activity of FLT-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, DR5, Cox2, and survivin. We then examined the capacity of the optimal promoter to modulate transgene expression followed by E1A activity in vitro and in vivo in a glioma stem cell model. In the presence of radiation, survivin mRNA activity increased 10-fold. Luciferase transgene expression was dose dependent and optimal at 2 Gy. A novel oncolytic adenovirus, CRAd-Survivin-pk7, showed significant toxicity and replication against a panel of passaged and primary CD133(+) glioma stem cells. On delivery of radiation, the toxicity associated with CRAd-Survivin-pk7 increased by 20% to 50% (P < 0.05). At the same time, the level of E1A activity increased 3- to 10-fold. In vivo, treatment of U373MG CD133(+) stem cells with CRAd-Survivin-pk7 and radiation significantly inhibited tumor growth (P < 0.05). At the same time, the level of E1A activity was 100-fold increased versus CRAd-Survivin-pk7 alone. Selected genes linked to radioinducible promoters whose expression can be regulated by ionizing radiation may improve the therapeutic ratio of virotherapy. In this study, we have identified a new radioinducible promoter, survivin, which greatly enhances the activity of an oncolytic adenovirus in the presence of low-dose radiotherapy.",Excluded
2494,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer: findings from a North Central Cancer Treatment Group pooled analysis OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (>=70 years of age) from a pooled analysis of four prospective trials.MATERIALS & METHODS: One hundred fifty-five patients with SCLC (limited stage, LSCLC, and extensive stage, ESCLC) participated in four phase II or III trials. Ninety-one patients received PCI (30 Gy/15 or 25 Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy.RESULTS: Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0 months vs. 7.6 months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR = 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p = 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR = 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p = 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p = 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery.CONCLUSIONS: PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs.",Included
1149,"What does an epileptiform spike look like in MEG? Comparison between coincident EEG and MEG spikes Recent investigations suggest that there are differences between the characteristics of EEG and MEG epileptiform spikes. The authors performed an objective characterization of the morphology of epileptiform spikes recorded simultaneously in both EEG and MEG to determine whether they present the same morphologic characteristics. Based on a stepwise approach, the authors performed a computer analysis of EEG and MEG of a set of coincident epileptiform transients selected by a senior clinical neurophysiologist in recordings of three patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A computer-based algorithm was applied to extract parameters that could be used to describe quantitatively the morphology of the transients, followed by a statistical comparison over the extracted metrics of the EEG and MEG waveforms. EEG and MEG coincident events were statistically different with respect to several morphologic characteristics, such as duration, sharpness, and shape. The differences found appear to be a consequence of MEG signals not being influenced by volume propagation through the tissues with different conductivities that surround the brain, compared with EEG, and of the different orientation of the underlying dipolar sources. The results indicate that visual inspection of MEG spikes and automatic spike-detector algorithms should use criteria adapted to the specific characteristics of the MEG, and not simply those used on conventional EEG.",Excluded

2349,"Patterning the cone mosaic array in zebrafish retina requires specification of ultraviolet-sensitive cones Cone photoreceptors in teleost fish are organized in precise, crystalline arrays in the epithelial plane of the retina. In zebrafish, four distinct morphological/spectral cone types occupy specific, invariant positions within a regular lattice. The cone lattice is aligned orthogonal and parallel to circumference of the retinal hemisphere: it emerges as cones generated in a germinal zone at the retinal periphery are incorporated as single-cell columns into the cone lattice. Genetic disruption of the transcription factor Tbx2b eliminates most of the cone subtype maximally sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths and also perturbs the long-range organization of the cone lattice. In the tbx2b mutant, the other three cone types (red, green, and blue cones) are specified in the correct proportion, differentiate normally, and acquire normal, planar polarized adhesive interactions mediated by Crumbs 2a and Crumbs 2b. Quantitative image analysis of cell adjacency revealed that the cones in the tbx2b mutant primarily have two nearest neighbors and align in single-cell-wide column fragments that are separated by rod photoreceptors. Some UV cones differentiate at the dorsal retinal margin in the tbx2b mutant, although they are severely dysmorphic and are eventually eliminated. Incorporating loss of UV cones during formation of cone columns at the margin into our previously published mathematical model of zebrafish cone mosaic formation (which uses bidirectional interactions between planar cell polarity proteins and anisotropic mechanical stresses in the plane of the retinal epithelium to generate regular columns of cones parallel to the margin) reproduces many features of the pattern disruptions seen in the tbx2b mutant.",Excluded

The reliability of measurement of a given parameter is inversely related to the variability shown by a set of measurements of that parameter made on the same subject under similar conditions. Reliable measures are fundamental to the clinical utility of any technique. We evaluated the reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and assessed both single-point and test-retest normal limits for H-reflex parameters of abductor brevis hallucis (ABH). The H reflex from the ABH muscle was recorded in 36 of 43 subjects, but could not be elicited in 7 of 11 subjects who were >60 years of age. The Hmax latency increased as height increased, whereas Hmax amplitude and Hmax/Mmax amplitude ratio decreased as age and height increased. The Hmax latency and Hmax/Mmax amplitude ratio, but not Hmax amplitude, proved to be reliable. The usefulness of the H reflex from ABH in the evaluation of S2 radiculopathies is described.",Excluded

In the epithermal reactor beams used for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for treatment of brain tumors, fission neutrons are a contaminating component. To estimate the radiosensitivity of the O-2A progenitors for fission neutrons, an in vivo-in vitro clonogenic assay was used. Radiosensitivity of progenitors obtained from the spinal cord of 1- or 5-day-old rats or the optic nerve of 2- or 12-week-old rats for 1 MeV fission neutrons was compared to that for 300 kVp X rays. Dose-survival curves were fitted according to the linear-quadratic model. The resulting beta component was very small to negligible. Progenitor cells obtained from rats of different ages show differences in radiosensitivity, characterized by different alpha values. RBE values for fission neutrons were 3.5 for 1-day-old spinal cord, 3.2 for 5-day-old spinal cord, 3.0 for 2-week-old optic nerve, and 4.3 for 12-week-old optic nerve. These high RBE values indicate the importance of minimizing the fast-neutron component in the epithermal neutron beams used for BNCT.",Included
3282,"Comparison of tumor volume delineation on magnetic resonance/ positron emission tomography versus standard computed tomography for head and neck cancer: Is there added value? Purpose/Objective(s): Computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used in head and neck radiation treatment planning. Combined MRI and PET (MR/PET) offers the advantage of simultaneous acquisition of multimodality biological information and possibly improved spatial resolution. In this study we assessed the added value of gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation on MR/PET compared to the standard practice of GTV delineation on CT. Materials/Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with chemoradiation therapy in an institutional review board-approved study. We performed 2 pretreatment scans: contrast-enhanced planning CT and gadolinium-enhanced MR/PET. Primary and nodal CT-based GTVs (GTV-CT) were delineated on planning CT scans. Treatments were delivered based on these volumes. Primary and nodal MR/PET-based tumor volumes were delineated retrospectively after treatment completion using anatomic MRI and metabolic PET information to form a biologic tumor volume (MRBTV). MRBTVs were delineated without knowledge of the GTV-CT (BM, AF). Accuracy of MRBTV contours was assessed by a neuroradiologist (BH). MR/PET scans were registered to planning CT scans and the MRBTV was transferred. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), a validated metric to evaluate spatial overlap, was calculated from the intersection and union of the GTV-CT (planning CT) and MRBTV (MR/PET). A DSC of 0.7 or greater was considered a ""good"" overlap. Doses received by the GTV-CT and MRBTV were compared. Result(s): Twelve patients completed a pretreatment planning CT and MR/PET. Primary disease site was oropharynx in 11 patients and larynx in 1 patient. Ten pts had evaluable primary tumor GTVs and 8 had evaluable nodal GTVs. For the primary GTV, mean GTV-CT was 12.9 mL and MRBTV was 13.3 mL. Mean primary GTV/BTV intersection was 8.1 mL, with a Dice ratio of 0.4. Dose received by at least 95% of the tumor volume (D95%) was 65.8 Gy for the primary GTV-CT versus 65.7 Gy for the primary MRBTV. For the nodal GTV, mean GTV-CT was 29.7 mL and MRBTV was 29.2 mL. Mean nodal MRBTV intersection was 19.7 mL with a Dice ratio of 0.5. D95% was 62.9 Gy for the nodal GTV-CT versus 61 Gy for the nodal MRBTV. Conclusion(s): MRBTV volumes were similar to GTV-CT but the spatial overlap was moderate. Despite only moderate spatial overlap, radiation dose received by the MRBTV was similar to that received by the GTV-CT. Most patients in our study had oropharyngeal primaries, for which the added sophistication of MRPET may not improve the quality of GTV delineation. MR/PET may show added value for primary tumors that are more difficult to delineate on CT, such as sinonasal, nasopharyngeal, and base of skull tumors.",Excluded

L-cysteine, a glutathione precursor, prevents oxidative damage. Transdermal patches (TDPs) loaded with L-cysteine hydrochloride (L-CyS-HCL) were fabricated by dispersion of L-CyS-HCL 5% w/w and different concentrations of sorbitol as a plasticizer in room-temperature vulcanizable synthetic silicone matrices (RTV-Si). The effect of sorbitol on patch physicochemical parameters was assessed; in-vitro L-CyS-HCL release profiles and ex-vivo permeation were studied. Pharmacokinetic parameters of endogenous synthetized in-vivo glutathione, after receiving IV bolus dose of L-CyS-HCl and L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs were studied in rat model. The influence of L-CyS-HCL-RTV-Si-TDPs against damaging effects of mobile phone EMR on rats' blood and brain tissues was studied. The results revealed that patch plasticity, intensity reflections, surface porosity, L-CyS-HCL release rate and skin permeation increased with increasing sorbitol concentration. Pharmacokinetic profile for IV dose and L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs revealed that the L-CyS-HCl-RTV-Si-TDPs provided a sustained glutathione plasma concentration-time profile over entire patch application. High significant differences in biological parameters (blood and brain samples) were observed for radiated rats using the patch in study compared with positive control rats.

2082,"Point process analysis of noise in early invertebrate vision Noise is a prevalent and sometimes even dominant aspect of many biological processes. While many natural systems have adapted to attenuate or even usefully integrate noise, the variability it introduces often still delimits the achievable precision across biological functions. This is particularly so for visual phototransduction, the process responsible for converting photons of light into usable electrical signals (quantum bumps). Here, randomness of both the photon inputs (regarded as extrinsic noise) and the conversion process (intrinsic noise) are seen as two distinct, independent and significant limitations on visual reliability. Past research has attempted to quantify the relative effects of these noise sources by using approximate methods that do not fully account for the discrete, point process and time ordered nature of the problem. As a result the conclusions drawn from these different approaches have led to inconsistent expositions of phototransduction noise performance. This paper provides a fresh and complete analysis of the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in invertebrate phototransduction using minimum mean squared error reconstruction techniques based on Bayesian point process (Snyder) filters. An integrate-fire based algorithm is developed to reliably estimate photon times from quantum bumps and Snyder filters are then used to causally estimate random light intensities both at the front and back end of the phototransduction cascade. Comparison of these estimates reveals that the dominant noise source transitions from extrinsic to intrinsic as light intensity increases. By extending the filtering techniques to account for delays, it is further found that among the intrinsic noise components, which include bump latency (mean delay and jitter) and shape (amplitude and width) variance, it is the mean delay that is critical to noise performance. As the timeliness of visual information is important for real-time action, this delay could potentially limit the speed at which invertebrates can respond to stimuli. Consequently, if one wants to increase visual fidelity, reducing the photoconversion lag is much more important than improving the regularity of the electrical signal.",Excluded

Intensity-damage curves generated for each wave-band indicated that UVA light was 50-80 times more effective than green light at causing photoreceptor cell losses. Examination of early ultrastructural changes in rod inner segments, outer segments, and retinal pigment epithelium revealed a remarkable degree of similarity between UVA and green light-induced damage. Furthermore, the two classes of damage were indistinguishable in terms of post-exposure recovery from threshold damage and regional distribution of photoreceptor cell loss along the vertical meridian. The finding of essentially identical histologic manifestations for the two classes of damage raises the possibility that they share a common biochemical etiology or pathway of cell destruction.",Excluded
939,"Muscles in microgravity: from fibres to human motion In simulated or actual microgravity, human and animal postural muscles undergo substantial atrophy: after about 270 days, the muscle mass attains a constant value of about 70% of the initial one. Most animal studies reported preferential atrophy of slow twitch fibres whose mechanical properties change towards the fast type. However, in humans, at the end of a 42-days bed rest study, a similar atrophy of slow and fast fibres was observed. After microgravity, the maximal force of several muscle groups showed a substantial decrease (6-25% of pre-flight values). The maximal power during very short ""explosive"" efforts of 0.25-0.30s showed an even greater fall, being reduced to 65% after 1 month and to 45% (of pre-flight values) after 6 months. The maximal power developed during 6-7s ""all-out"" bouts on an isokinetic cycloergometer was reduced to a lesser extent, attaining about 75% of pre-flight values, regardless of the flight duration. In these same subjects, the muscle mass of the lower limbs declined by only 9-13%. Thus, a substantial fraction of the observed decreases of maximal power is probably due to a deterioration of the motor co-ordination brought about by the absence of gravity. To prevent this substantial decay of maximal absolute power, we propose that explosive exercise be added to the daily in-flight training schedule. We also describe a system aimed at reducing cardiovascular deconditioning wherein gravity is simulated by the centrifugal acceleration generated by the motion of two counter rotating bicycles ridden by the astronauts on the inner wall of a cylindrical space module. Finally, cycling on circular or elliptical tracks may be useful to reduce cardiovascular deconditioning in permanently manned lunar bases. Indeed, on the curved parts of the path, a cyclist generates an outward acceleration vector (ac). To counterbalance ac, the cyclist must lean inwards, so that the vectorial sum of ac plus the lunar gravity tends to the acceleration of gravity prevailing on Earth.",Excluded

The rats were randomly divided into four equal groups. The control group did not receive melatonin or irradiation but received both 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally and sham irradiation. The irradiation (IR) group received 5 Gy gamma irradiation to the total cranium as a single dose plus 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally. The melatonin plus IR group received irradiation to the total cranium plus 5 mg/kg/day melatonin intraperitoneally. The melatonin group received only 5 mg/kg/day melatonin plus sham-irradiation. Biochemical parameters measured in murine lenses were carried out using spectrophotometric techniques.RESULTS: Lens antioxidant capacity, as measured by levels of total superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA) and glutathione reductase (GRD) activity, significantly increased in melatonin, control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the IR group. Lens glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity significantly increased in control and melatonin groups when compared with the IR group. Lens malondialdehyde (MDA) levels significantly increased in the IR group when compared with control, melatonin and melatonin plus IR groups. Lens TSSA and NSSA activities significantly decreased in control and melatonin plus IR groups when compared with the melatonin group.

2355,"The effect of DFMO induced uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine on human glioma cells Polyamine synthesis inhibitors, such as alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, upon cessation of treatment, tumor growth resumes. We hypothesized that incorporation of radioactive polyamines might kill the growth-arrested cells. This hypothesis was previously tested in rat 9L brain tumor cells in which DFMO increased both the uptake and the retention of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine. In these rat cells, DFMO-induced retention of high-specific-activity [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine for 20 days resulted in several logs killing. In the present studies all of the 5 different human glioma cell lines tested with DFMO treatment also showed enhanced uptake of exogenous [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine, reduced cell counts and enhanced killing of colony forming cells (CSF). Extending the time of DFMO treatment of cells that had taken up high-specific-activity (80 Ci/mmol) [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine further increased the killing. A 10-day extension resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in cumulative cell growth. A 5-day extension resulted in a 2-3 log decrease in numbers of surviving CFC. These data further support the hypothesis and suggest that DFMO-induced cell cycle arrest enhances cellular retention of [<sup>3</sup>H] putrescine, increasing the effective internal radiation dose enough to cause proliferative death. In a clinical setting, the short (~ 1 mum) path-length of the tritium beta particle should limit effects to the tumor cells and spare adjacent normal cells. These results support the concept that treatment with the combination of polyamine inhibitors and radioactive polyamines might be a useful adjunct to current therapies for glioblastoma multiforme.",Excluded

247,"Alterations in rat brain neurogenesis following exposure to fractionated doses of ionizing radiation Ionizing radiation commonly used in the radiotherapy of brain tumours can cause adverse side effects to surrounding normal brain tissue. The adult mammalian subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain lateral ventricles (LV) and their subsequent lateral ventricular extension, the rostral migratory stream (RMS), is one of the few areas, which retains the ability to generate new neurons and glial cells throughout life. The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurence of radiation-induced alterations of forebrain's neurogenesis. Adult male Wistar rats were investigated 30, 60 or 90 days after whole-body irradiation with fractionated doses of gamma rays (the total dose of 4 Gy). For the study of alterations of the numbers of proliferating cells and precise identification of cell specific phenotype through the migratory pathway, the immunohistochemistry for either doublecortin (DCX), cell marker for immature neurons or glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) for labeling of astrocytes were used. However, the data from quantitative analysis of the numbers of proliferating cells are still under evaluation, our preliminary results showed, that fractionated irradiation has long-lasting effect on extent of neurogenesis in this radiosensitive region. Obtained results should have implications for clinical radiotherapy to avoid complications in therapeutic brain irradiation.",Included
2634,"Principles of diagnostic sonography in iliopsoas tendon pathology: A case report This article describes the diagnostic value of musculoskeletal sonography in the management of tendon pathology and outlines a clinical example of its scope of utilization. Herein we describe the case of a 65-year-old man who sought rehabilitation services for left groin pain following a period of intense trekking and uphill walking. He presented with left hip flexor weakness and local tenderness over the left iliopsoas tendon with negative findings on neurological evaluation. Additionally, he presented with left hip capsule and hip flexor tightness with left gluteus maximus and gluteus medius weakness. The left hip capsule tightness was predominantly in the posterior fibres, with restriction of hip internal rotation. The clinical picture overall was suggestive of the presence of risk parameters for iliopsoas tendinopathy. Plain radiographs of the hip revealed mild degenerative changes with a mild pincer impingement. While his clinical and radiological picture was suggestive of degenerative and soft tissue pathology of the hip, a real-time sonographic study was useful in the quantitative confirmation of a partial tear of the left iliopsoas tendon. Additionally, a repeat sonographic study performed four weeks later, revealed a healing iliopsoas tendon seen as a decrease in the width of the hypoechoic presentation of the tear. To summarize, the value of musculoskeletal sonography as a diagnostic tool as well as the assessment of the progression of tendon healing is discussed. Sonography is safe, noninvasive, and does not use ionizing radiation. It is steadily gaining popularity in the diagnosis of tendon lesions.",Excluded

2416,"A model for assessing cognitive impairment after fractionated whole-brain irradiation in nonhuman primates To investigate the effect of fractionated whole-brain irradiation on nonhuman primates, 6-9-year-old male rhesus monkeys were irradiated with 40 Gy delivered as two 5-Gy fractions/week for 4 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed 5 days/week for 4 months prior to fractionated whole-brain irradiation and for 11 months after irradiation using a Delayed-Match-to-Sample (DMS) task at both low and high cognitive loads. Local rates of cerebral glucose metabolism were measured prior to and 9 months after irradiation using [(18)F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography. Low cognitive load trials did not reveal a significant reduction in performance until 7 months after irradiation; performance then declined progressively. In high cognitive load trials, the initial impairment was observed ~1 month after irradiation. This was followed by a transient recovery period over the next 1-2 months, after which performance declined progressively through 11 months after irradiation. Nine months after irradiation, glucose uptake during the DMS task was decreased in the cuneate and prefrontal cortex and was increased in the cerebellum and thalamus compared with the levels prior to irradiation. Results from this pilot study suggest that the radiation-induced changes in cognition and brain metabolism observed in rhesus monkeys may be similar to those observed in brain tumor patients receiving brain irradiation.",Included
840,Accurate localization of optic radiation during neurosurgery in an interventional MRI suite Accurate localization of the optic radiation is key to improving the surgical outcome for patients undergoing anterior temporal lobe resection for the treatment of refractory focal epilepsy. Current commercial interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners are capable of performing anatomical and diffusion weighted imaging and are used for guidance during various neurosurgical procedures. We present an interventional imaging workflow that can accurately localize the optic radiation during surgery. The workflow is driven by a near real-time multichannel nonrigid image registration algorithm that uses both anatomical and fractional anisotropy pre- and intra-operative images. The proposed workflow is implemented on graphical processing units and we perform a warping of the pre-operatively parcellated optic radiation to the intra-operative space in under 3 min making the proposed algorithm suitable for use under the stringent time constraints of neurosurgical procedures. The method was validated using both a numerical phantom and clinical data using pre- and post-operative images from patients who had undergone surgery for treatment of refractory focal epilepsy and shows strong correlation between the observed post-operative visual field deficit and the predicted damage to the optic radiation. We also validate the algorithm using interventional MRI datasets from a small cohort of patients. This work could be of significant utility in image guided interventions and facilitate effective surgical treatments.,Excluded

2178,"Coding of Azimuthal Directions via Time-Compensated Combination of Celestial Compass Cues Many animals use the sun as a reference for spatial orientation [1-3]. In addition to sun position, the sky provides two other sources of directional information, a color gradient [4] and a polarization pattern [5]. Work on insects has predominantly focused on celestial polarization as an orientation cue [6, 7]. Relying on sky polarization alone, however, poses the following two problems: E vector orientations in the sky are not suited to distinguish between the solar and antisolar hemisphere of the sky, and the polarization pattern changes with changing solar elevation during the day [8, 9]. Here, we present neurons that overcome both problems in a locust's brain. The spiking activity of these neurons depends (1) on the E vector orientation of dorsally presented polarized light, (2) on the azimuthal, i.e., horizontal, direction, and (3) on the wavelength of an unpolarized light source. Their tuning to these stimuli matches the distribution of a UV/green chromatic contrast as well as the polarization of natural skylight and compensates for changes in solar elevation during the day. The neurons are, therefore, suited to code for solar azimuth by concurrent combination of signals from the spectral gradient, intensity gradient, and polarization pattern of the sky. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

771,"Radiation dose analysis of large and giant internal carotid artery aneurysm treatment with the pipeline embolization device versus traditional coiling techniques BACKGROUND: Flow diversion is an effective and increasingly accepted method for endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Additionally, the public has heightened concerns regarding radiation exposure from medical procedures. This study analyzes radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during treatment of large and giant proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms with the pipeline embolization device (PED) versus traditional coiling techniques.METHODS: Radiation dose, fluoroscopy time, and contrast dye administration were retrospectively analyzed in 55 patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aneurysms >= 10 mm from petrous to superior hypophyseal ICA segments. Patients were treated by either PED (37 patients) or traditional coiling techniques (18 patients). Aortic arch type and proximal ICA tortuosity were also assessed as markers of access difficulty.RESULTS: Average radiation dose with PED treatment was 2840 +/- 213 mGy and 4010 +/- 708 mGy with traditional coiling techniques (p=0.048; 29% decrease with PED). Mean fluoroscopy time for PED was 56.1 +/- 5.0 min and 85.9 +/- 11.9 min for coiling cases (p=0.0087; 35% decrease with PED). These benefits existed despite more difficult arch anatomy and a trend towards greater proximal vessel tortuosity in PED cases. Contrast dye amounts were also reduced by 37.5% in PED cases (75 +/- 6 mL) versus coiling cases (120 +/- 13 mL, p=0.0008).CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of large and giant proximal ICA aneurysms using PED requires less radiation, less fluoroscopy time, and less contrast administration than standard coiling techniques. This further demonstrates the benefits of flow diversion for treatment of these aneurysms.",Excluded

A chest wall structure was retrospectively defined on planning scans, and chest wall dosimetry and tumour-related factors recorded. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors predictive of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain.RESULTS: 182 patients and 187 tumours were included. There were 20 (10.9%) episodes of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that the maximum dose received by 1 cm(3) of chest wall (Dmax1 cm(3)) and tumour size were significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain [Dmax1 cm(3) odds ratio : 1.104, 95% confidence interval : 1.012-1.204, p = 0.025; tumour size (mm) odds ratio : 1.080, 95% confidence interval : 1.026-1.136, p = 0.003]. This model was an adequate fit to the data (Hosmer and Lemeshow test non-significant) and a fair discriminator for chest wall pain (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.74). Using the multivariate logistic regression model, parameters for Dmax1 cm(3) are provided, which predict <10% and <20% risks of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain for different tumour sizes.CONCLUSION: Grade 2+ chest wall pain is an uncommon side effect of lung SABR. Larger tumour size and increasing Dmax1 cm(3) are significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. When planning lung SABR, it is prudent to try to avoid hot volumes in the chest wall, particularly for larger tumours.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article demonstrates that Grade 2 or greater chest wall pain following lung SABR is more common when the tumour is larger in size and the Dmax1 cm(3) of the chest wall is higher. When planning lung SABR, the risk of chest wall pain may be reduced if maximum doses are minimized, particularly for larger tumours.",Excluded
222,"Does radiation exposure portend worse postoperative outcomes after cystectomy with urinary diversion for benign indications? INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative radiation exposure is traditionally thought to correlate with increased postoperative complications after cystectomy with urinary diversion (CxUD) for benign indications. We assessed postoperative outcomes among patients who received CxUD, stratified by radiation exposure. METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients undergoing CxUD over a 10 year period encompassed demographics, operative parameters, 30 and 90 day readmission and complications. CxUD for malignant indications and in patients below 18 years of age were excluded. Chi-square and t-test analyses assessed demographics and indications. Complications were measured by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULT(S): Among 103 patients, 39 (38%) had radiation exposure prior to CxUD. Mean age for patients with radiation exposure undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion was significantly higher (69.8 vs 59.7 years, p=0.001). In patients receiving preoperative radiation, 23.1% (9/39) had congestive heart failure (p=0.005). Other preexisting conditions such as diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, renal disease and liver disease were not associated with radiation exposure. Operative time (p=0.861), estimated blood loss (p=0.756) and length of stay (p=0.776) were not associated with radiation exposure. There was a significant correlation between radiation exposure and having a preoperative diagnosis of genitourinary fistulae (p=0.001), neurogenic bladder (p<0.0001) and urethral stricture (p=0.002). Radiation exposure did not correlate to readmission at 30 days (p=0.256) or at 90 days (p=0.576). Ureteroileal strictures requiring interventional radiology procedures were observed in 6 patients (5.8%) and stomal stenosis was seen in 2 patients (1.9%). Neither variable was correlated with radiation exposure (p=0.27 and p=0.265, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): In spite of patients being older with more comorbidities at baseline, patients with preoperative radiation exposure undergoing CxUD for benign indications did not have increased readmission at 30 or 90 days or increased complications postoperatively. Additionally, operative parameters such as surgery time, estimated blood loss and length of stay were similar between radiation and naive patient groups. These findings suggest radiation exposure prior to CxUD may not portend as negative consequences as once thought.",Included
597,"Cranial irradiation alters dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus Therapeutic irradiation of the brain is a common treatment modality for brain tumors, but can lead to impairment of cognitive function. Dendritic spines are sites of excitatory synaptic transmission and changes in spine structure and number are thought to represent a morphological correlate of altered brain functions associated with hippocampal dependent learning and memory. To gain some insight into the temporal and sub region specific cellular changes in the hippocampus following brain irradiation, we investigated the effects of 10 Gy cranial irradiation on dendritic spines in young adult mice. One week or 1 month post irradiation, changes in spine density and morphology in dentate gyrus (DG) granule and CA1 pyramidal neurons were quantified using Golgi staining. Our results showed that in the DG, there were significant reductions in spine density at both 1 week (11.9%) and 1 month (26.9%) after irradiation. In contrast, in the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, irradiation resulted in a significant reduction (18.7%) in spine density only at 1 week post irradiation. Analysis of spine morphology showed that irradiation led to significant decreases in the proportion of mushroom spines at both time points in the DG as well as CA1 basal dendrites. The proportions of stubby spines were significantly increased in both the areas at 1 month post irradiation. Irradiation did not alter spine density in the CA1 apical dendrites, but there were significant changes in the proportion of thin and mushroom spines at both time points post irradiation. Although the mechanisms involved are not clear, these findings are the first to show that brain irradiation of young adult animals leads to alterations in dendritic spine density and morphology in the hippocampus in a time dependent and region specific manner.",Included

UK was given as a loading dose of 3000 mug/kg body weight, followed by 3000 mug/kg/h for 6 hours. Thoracic irradiation with split technique (46 Gy) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (25 Gy) were administered to responding patients. A second staging was performed in patients exhibiting a clinical complete response (CR) after 1 year. Results. In 27 patients with limited disease, there were 23 CR and 8 partial responses (PR) (CR, 85.1%; 66.2-95.8% at 95% confidence intervals); in 24 patients with extensive disease, there were 17 CR, 4 PR, and 3 cases with progression. Pathologically proven CR were observed in 59.2% patients with limited disease and 33.3% patients with extensive disease. Survival rates were as follows: in patients with limited disease, 1 year, 85.1%; 2 years, 55.5%; and 3 years, 25.9%; in patients with extensive disease, 1 year, 54.1; and 2 years, 16.9%.

2151,"Role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSCs radiation response; regeneration or senescence? Purpose or Objective Secretory function restoration is a challenge for regenerative therapy of radiation-damaged salivary glands. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed to allow such a functional regeneration. It has been suggested that glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes survival of mice salivary gland stem cells (mSGSCs). GDNF-treatment in combination with stem cell based regenerative therapy could represent a promising treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and consequential xerostomia. However, the role of GDNF on SGSC survival and proliferation after therapeutic irradiation is still an enigma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSC response to irradiation. Material and Methods Salivary gland organoid derived cells of Gdnf hypermorphic (Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup>) and wild-type mice (Gdnfwt/wt) were irradiated (IR) with gamma-rays at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy. mSGSC survival and stemness were assessed by calculating stem cell surviving fraction measured as post- IR organoid forming potential and population doublings. Flow cytometry was used to determine the CD24<sup>hi</sup>/CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell (SC) population. qPCR and immunofluorescence were used to detect GDNF expression. Six-day-old salivary gland organoids were irradiated with 7 Gy of yrays, IR induced organoids senescence were confirmed by SA-s-Gal and P16 staining. Results Exogenously added GDNF or increase expression of GDNF in hypermorphic mice SGSC induced an increase in secondary organoids formation efficiency when compared to wild-type mice/untreated SG (p<0.05). However, neither endogenous nor exogenous GDNF increased the CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell-like population. Organoids IR surviving fraction (OSF) of mSGSCs were similar albeit resulted in larger spheres and an increased cell number in the Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> compared to Gdnfwt/wt group. Indeed, mSGSC of Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> mice showed high sphere forming efficiency upon replating. Cell cycle distribution of SGSC after irradiation had no difference with or without GDNF. Interestingly, GDNF expression was highly upregulated after irradiation both in vitro (p=0.008) and in vivo (p<0.05) but normalized in vivo after mSGSC transplantation-related regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) expression was strongly related to OSF (r=0.842, p=0.002) and co-localized with GDNF in salivary gland striated ducts. More than 90% IR induced senescence located in striated ducts where GDNF colocalized with senescence marker p16 and SA-s-Gal. Interestingly, senescence cells were detected in organoids after IR. Conclusion GDNF does not protect mSGSCs against irradiation but seems to promote mSGSCs proliferation through the GDNF-RET signaling pathway. Post-transplantation stimulation of GDNF/RET pathway may enhance the regenerative potential of mSGSCs. IR induced upregulation of GDNF may be involved in IR induced senescence.",Included
2784,"Arachidonic acid potentiates acid-sensing ion channels in rat sensory neurons by a direct action Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are activated by a decrease in extracellular pH. ASICs are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons, and several lines of evidence suggest that they are responsible for signaling the pain caused by extracellular acidification, but little is understood of the modulation of ASICs by pro-inflammatory factors. Using whole-cell patch clamp we demonstrate that low pH evokes three distinct inward currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons: a slowly inactivating transient current, a rapidly inactivating transient current, and a sustained current. All three currents were potentiated by arachidonic acid (AA), to 123%, 171%, and 264% of peak current, respectively. Membrane stretch had no effect on proton-gated currents, implying that AA is unlikely to act via local membrane deformation. The current carried by heterologously expressed ASIC1a and ASIC3 was also potentiated by AA. AA potentiates ASIC activation by a direct mechanism, because inhibition of AA metabolism had no effect on potentiation, and potentiation of single ASIC2a channels could be observed in cell-free patches. Potentiation by lipids with the same chain length as AA increased as the number of double bonds was increased. AA is known to be released in inflammation and the results suggest that AA may be an important pro-inflammatory agent responsible for enhancing acid-mediated pain.",Excluded
2835,"Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition delays recurrence of glioblastoma after radiation by altering myeloid cell recruitment and polarization BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) may initially respond to treatment with ionizing radiation (IR), but the prognosis remains extremely poor because the tumors invariably recur. Using animal models, we previously showed that inhibiting stromal cell-derived factor 1 signaling can prevent or delay GBM recurrence by blocking IR-induced recruitment of myeloid cells, specifically monocytes that give rise to tumor-associated macrophages. The present study was aimed at determining if inhibiting colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) signaling could be used as an alternative strategy to target pro-tumorigenic myeloid cells recruited to irradiated GBM.METHODS: To inhibit CSF-1 signaling in myeloid cells, we used PLX3397, a small molecule that potently inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R). Combined IR and PLX3397 therapy was compared with IR alone using 2 different human GBM intracranial xenograft models.RESULTS: GBM xenografts treated with IR upregulated CSF-1R ligand expression and increased the number of CD11b+ myeloid-derived cells in the tumors. Treatment with PLX3397 both depleted CD11b+ cells and potentiated the response of the intracranial tumors to IR. Median survival was significantly longer for mice receiving combined therapy versus IR alone. Analysis of myeloid cell differentiation markers indicated that CSF-1R inhibition prevented IR-recruited monocyte cells from differentiating into immunosuppressive, pro-angiogenic tumor-associated macrophages.CONCLUSION: CSF-1R inhibition may be a promising strategy to improve GBM response to radiotherapy.",Excluded
3444,"The possible neurobehavioral protective effects of natural antioxidant against phototoxicity attenuation of antimicrobial quinolone group in rats The fluoroquinolones absorb light in the 320 to 330 nm ultraviolet A (UV-A) wavelength and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide; thus, the photodynamic generation of ROS may be the basis of phototoxicity of quinolones in human beings and animals. This study aimed to evaluate the damaging effects of UV-A radiation at different periods of exposure on rats' brains administered with ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin administration in UV-A exposed animals exaggerated the brain-oxidative stress biomarkers and decreased the locomotor activity. Exposure of rats to UV-A for 60 minutes induced a significant increase of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and a decrease in the values of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) compared to a normal one; these changes were UV-A exposure time-dependent. However, the administration of vitamin C to the UV-60-treated group decreased the values of MDA, MPO, and shifted the values of SOD, GSH toward the normal values. Vitamin C, probably due to its strong antioxidant properties, could improve and partially counteract the toxic effect of UV-A on oxidative stress parameters and prevent the damage in rat's brain tissues.",Excluded
2433,"Exposure to different wavelengths of light and the development of structural and functional asymmetries in the chicken The thalamofugal visual projections of the chick are known to develop in response to stimulation by light prior to hatching, and asymmetry in the number of projections develops as a consequence of the embryo being oriented in the egg so that it occuludes its left eye. The right eye only is stimulated by light and this causes the visual projections connected to the right eye to develop in advance of those connected to the left. We have now found that exposure of embryos, from day 19 of incubation to hatching, to red (peak transmission at 670 nm) or green (peak at 500 nm) light is as effective as broad-spectrum (white) light in establishing asymmetry in these projections. The intensities of the light to which the embryos were exposed in each case were equivalent, achieved in part by removing the air sac end of the egg shell. The thalamofugal visual projections, therefore, develop in response to light stimulation but appear to have no wavelength specificity. This result is consistent with the apparent lack of involvement of the thalamofugal visual pathway in colour vision. However, functional asymmetry, tested as left-right eye differences in categorising grain from pebbles, was found to be less marked in the chicks that had been exposed to green light compared to those that had been exposed to 'while' light, and it was absent in those exposed to red light or incubated in the dark. Thus, there is wavelength specificity for the development of the behavioural asymmetry, which suggests involvement of colour-coded neurons outside the thalamofugal visual pathway, probably in the tectofugal pathway. Exposure of the embryos to red and green light alternating at 30 min intervals is as effective as ""white' light for establishing both the structural and functional asymmetry.",Excluded

However, the biological effects of carbon ion radiation are still incompletely understood. Here, we systematically compared the biological effects of clinically used carbon ion radiation to photon radiation with emphasis on DNA repair.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two human glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and LN229) were irradiated with carbon ions or photons and DNA damage response was systematically analyzed, including clonogenic survival, induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), cell cycle arrest and apoptosis or autophagy. gammaH2AX foci were analyzed by flow cytometry, conventional light microscopy and 3D superresolution microscopy.RESULTS: DSBs were repaired delayed and with slower kinetics after carbon ions versus photons. Carbon ions caused stronger and longer-lasting cell cycle delays, predominantly in G2 phase, and a higher rate of apoptosis. Compared to photons, the effectiveness of carbon ions was less cell cycle-dependent. Homologous recombination (HR) appeared to be more important for DSB repair after carbon ions versus photons in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient U87 cells, as opposed to PTEN-proficient LN229 cells.CONCLUSION: Carbon ions induced more severe DSB damage than photons, which was repaired less efficiently in both cell lines. Thus, carbon ion radiotherapy may help to overcome resistance mechanisms of glioblastoma associated with DNA repair for example in combination with repair pathway-specific drugs in the context of personalized radiotherapy.",Excluded

By using mimics corresponding to the reported in vivo phosphorylation sites in the human lens, we have examined the effects of phosphorylation upon the chaperone-like properties and structure of alphaB-crystallin. Here we show that phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin at Ser-45 results in uncontrolled aggregation. By using an innovative tandem mass spectrometry approach, we demonstrate how this alteration in behavior stems from disruption of dimeric substructure within the polydisperse alphaB-crystallin assembly. This structural perturbation appears to disturb the housekeeping role of alphaB-crystallin and consequently has important implications for the disease states caused by protein aggregation in the lens and deposition in non-lenticular tissue.",Excluded

Of the 279 patients, 263 had evidence of gross residual disease at the time of treatment (16 had no evidence of gross residual disease), 141 had tumors of a major salivary gland, and 138 had tumors of minor salivary glands. The median follow-up period was 36 months (range, 1-142 months).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local-regional control, cause-specific survival, and freedom from metastasis.RESULTS: The 6-year actuarial cause-specific survival rate was 67%. Multivariate analysis revealed that low group stage (I-II) disease, minor salivary sites, lack of skull base invasion, and primary disease were associated with a statistically significant improvement in cause-specific survival. The 6-year actuarial local-regional control rate was 59%. Multivariate analysis revealed size 4 cm or smaller, lack of base of skull invasion, prior surgical resection, and no previous radiotherapy to have a statistically significant improved local-regional control. Sixteen patients without evidence of gross residual disease had a 100% 6-year actuarial local-regional control. The 6-year actuarial freedom from metastasis rate was 64%. Factors associated with decreased development of systemic metastases included negative lymph nodes at the time of treatment and lack of base of skull involvement. The 6-year actuarial rate of development of grade 3 or 4 long-term toxicity (using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research on the Treatment of Cancer criteria) was 10%. No patient experienced grade 5 toxic effects.CONCLUSIONS: Neuron radiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with salivary gland neoplasms who have gross residual disease and achieves excellent local-regional control in patients without evidence of gross disease.",Excluded

Dental professionals should provide preventive and supportive care, including education and symptom management, for patients experiencing oral complications related to cancer therapy, and should closely monitor patients' level of distress, ability to cope, and treatment response.

2328,"Pre-treatment of adult rats with high doses of erythropoietin induces caspase-9 but prevents light-induced retinal injury Erythropoietin (Epo) had been shown to have a neuroprotective effect independent from its erythropoietic properties. In this study, we tested whether Epo could protect the retina from damage induced by a long period of moderate light insult and how it protected. First, rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) by human recombinant Epo at 5000 or 30,000U/kg to assess Epo concentration in plasma and retina. Second, rats were untreated or injected i.p. with Epo at 30,000U/kg, 1 or 4h before being placed in constant light (24h; 2200lux). Electroretinograms (ERG) were recorded before treatment, 1day and 15days (D15) after light exposure. After the last ERG, eyes were taken for histology. In parallel, we tested Epo protection against oxidative stressors on isolated retinas and its effect on caspase-9 activity. Epo injected at 30,000U/kg body weight, 4h before exposure to the damaging light, protected retinal function and structure against light damage and induced an increase in caspase-9 activity and expression. Epo had no direct or indirect protective effect against free radicals-induced death on isolated retinas. Epo protected the retina from a long period of moderate light exposure through a mechanism independent from a free radical scavenging property or an antioxidant facilitating activity. The activation of caspase-9, 4h after Epo injection, corresponding to the start of light exposure, suggests that caspase-9 plays a role in neuroprotection.",Excluded
1107,"Does the pretherapeutic tumor SUV in 68Ga DOTATOC PET predict the absorbed dose of 177Lu octreotate? PURPOSE: Selection of candidates for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is increasingly based on receptor positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, including the common tracer Ga DOTATOC. However, no studies have yet compared standardized uptake values (SUVs) and absorbed doses in this field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of 21 patients with 61 evaluable tumor lesions undergoing both pretherapeutic Ga DOTATOC-PET/CT (Biograph Duo [Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany]; PET acquisition, 75.3 +/- 15.4 minutes postinjection; 117.3 +/- 33.9 MBq Ga DOTATOC) and PRRT with Lu octreotate (7.47 +/- 1.39 GBq; intratherapeutic tumor dosimetry with serial whole-body scans; 1, 2, and 4 days postinjection) at our institution. SUVs were compared with the tumor-absorbed doses per injected activity (D/A0) of the subsequent first treatment cycle. RESULT(S): The correlation of SUV and D/A0 was r = 0.72 (SUVmean) and r = 0.71 (SUVmax), both P < 0.001. Pancreatic origin and hepatic localization were associated with higher D/A0, and chromogranin A level and Ki-67 index had no influence on SUV or D/A0. High-SUV lesions (SUVmean >15; SUVmax >25) resulted in high D/A0 (>10 Gy/GBq) in 66.7% to 70.8% and low D/A0 (<5 Gy/GBq) in only 8.3% to 12.5% on subsequent PRRT. The mentioned low D/A0 range, on the other hand, was achieved by all lesions with SUVmean <7 or SUVmax <9. CONCLUSION(S): Somatostatin receptor PET imaging may predict tumor-absorbed doses. The ability to indicate insufficient target irradiation by a low SUV could aid in selection of appropriate candidates for PRRT. However, larger series are needed to confirm and validate these initial findings. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
2040,"Target size analysis of opioid receptors. No difference between receptor types, but discrimination between two receptor states Target size analysis of opioid receptor is complicated by the presence of multi-exponential inactivation curves. Irradiation of intact frozen tissue proved essential to eliminate such artifacts, due to indirect irradiation effects. Upon irradiation condition, opioid binding activity was inactivated in a single mono-exponential manner. Identical inactivation curves were obtained for mu, delta and kappa binding activities in brain membranes from rat, guinea-pig and frog and in NG 108-15 cells: the molecular mass obtained was 98 +/- 2 kDa. However, when opioid binding was assayed in the presence of Na+, Mg2+ and GTP, the molecular mass was found to be only 56 +/- 4.4 kDa. We suggest that the opioid recognition site comprises a unit of 56 kDa and that in the absence of Na+, Mg2+ and GTP an additional membrane component of 40-44 kDa is necessary for high-affinity opioid binding.",Excluded

In light-deprived (LD) animals, only a few scattered cell nuclei were found throughout the striate cortex (V1). Exposure to light promoted a significant increase in the density of Egr-1 labeled nuclei in V1. Laminar distribution of immunoreactive nuclei in light-stimulated animals (LS) tended to vary with topography: the lateral region, which corresponds to the central representation of the visual field, appeared to have higher density of cells expressing protein in the supragranular layers, as compared to the medial region, which corresponds to the representation of the peripheral field of vision. Finally, LS animals displayed a narrow band of labeled cell nuclei in the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and throughout the anteroposterior extent of the superior colliculus (SC). In contrast, almost no Egr-1 immunolabeling was found in the IGL and SC of LD animals.

The aim of the present study was to determine the stereological parameters of the brain areas involved in motion (motor cortex) and spatial learning - memory (hippocampus) under an HU condition. Sixteen adult male rats, kept under a 12: 12 h light-dark cycle, were divided into two groups of freely moving (n=8) and HU (n=8) rats. The volume of motor cortex and hippocampus, the numerical cell density of neurons in layers I, II-III, V, and VI of the motor cortex, the entire motor cortex as well as the primary motor cortex, and the numerical density of the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus subregions of the hippocampus were estimated. No significant differences were observed in the evaluated parameters. Our results thus indicated that motor cortical and hippocampal atrophy and cell loss may not necessarily be involved in the motion and spatial learning memory impairment in the rat.

1011,"The diurnal susceptibility of rat retinal photoreceptors to light-induced damage Exposure of albino rats to high intensity light results in rapid, graded loss of photoreceptors. The hormonal status and age of an animal at the time of exposure affect the severity of light-induced retinal damage. The adrenal axis and pituitary hormones (prolactin) have been demonstrated previously to affect the degree of cell death in the retina. Because circadian rhythms for adrenal and pituitary secretion have been demonstrated in the rat, a series of experiments was undertaken to determine if a diurnal pattern of retinal susceptibility to light damage exists which might be related to endogenous endocrine rhythms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 4 hr of high intensity fluorescent light for 8 consecutive days during different phases of the 14:10 hr light: dark animal room light cycle. Morphometric analysis performed at the light microscopic level 2 weeks after exposure demonstrated a differential susceptibility to light-induced cell death depending upon the period during the light-dark cycle when animals received their daily light exposure. Neuronal cell death was confined to the outer nuclear layer as previously described. The retinas of animals exposed during the middle of the dark period or during the first 5 hr of the light period were significantly more damaged than the retinas of animals exposed during the last 9 hr of the light period. Control groups for the relative amounts of dark-adaptation between groups suggested that the diurnal susceptibility to light damage was not solely dependent upon the degree of dark adaptation. These results demonstrate a diurnal susceptibility of photoreceptors to light-induced cell death.",Excluded

2226,"Incidence and management of late adverse radiation effects after arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery Background: Late adverse radiation effects (ARE) typically occur many years after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). They are characterized by perilesional edema or cyst formation and are distinct from radiationinduced changes (RIC) noted in the first 1 to 2 years after AVM SRS and radiation necrosis. Objective(s): To determine the incidence of late ARE after AVM SRS. Method(s): Retrospective review of 233 AVM patients having SRS from 1990 to 2009. Patients had sporadic AVM, no prior radiation, and a minimum of 5 years of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up. The median MRI follow-up after SRS was 9.8 years (range, 5-24.2). Result(s): Late ARE were observed in 16 patients (6.9%) at a median of 8.7 years after SRS (range, 2.0-16.1). The 5-, 10-, and 15-year incidence of late ARE was 0.4%, 7.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. Eight patients (3.4%) were symptomatic at the time of ARE detection. Three of 8 patients who were initially asymptomatic had documented cyst progression (at 11, 40, and 42 months), for an overall symptomatic rate of 4.7%. Five patients with asymptomatic ARE have been observed for a median of 9.3 years (range, 2.0-14.1) without progression. Patients having early RIC (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, P < .001), patients having obliteration (HR=1.24, P=.02), and patients having SRS before April 1997 (HR=1.12, P=.02) weremore likely to develop late ARE. Conclusion(s): Late ARE are common in AVM patients who develop early RIC after SRS.

279,"ATM-dependent activation of the gene encoding MAP kinase phosphatase 5 by radiomimetic DNA damage Cellular responses to DNA damage are mediated by an extensive network of signaling pathways. The ATM protein kinase is a master regulator of the response to double-strand breaks (DSBs), the most cytotoxic DNA lesion caused by ionizing radiation. ATM is the protein missing or inactive in patients with the pleiotropic genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A major response to DNA damage is altered expression of numerous genes. While studying gene expression in control and A-T cells following treatment with the radiomimetic chemical neocarzinostatin (NCS), we identified an expressed sequence tag that represented a gene that was induced by DSBs in an ATM-dependent manner. The corresponding cDNA encoded a dual specificity phosphatase of the MAP kinase phosphatase family, MKP-5. MKP-5 dephosphorylates and inactivates the stress-activated MAP kinases JNK and p38. The phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of JNK and p38 by NCS was attenuated in A-T cells. Thus, ATM modulates this cycle in response to DSBs. These results further highlight ATM as a link between the DNA damage response and major signaling pathways involved in proliferative and apoptotic processes.",Excluded

2406,"Radiation induced cardiovascular disease: An odyssey of bedside-bench-bedside approach The journey to Mars will be an ambitious, yet arduous task as it will entail culmination of all the information we have gathered over many decades. While the mission is of utmost importance, preservation of astronaut's well-being is paramount also. To that end, mitigation of radiation risk especially afflicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of great interest and challenge. Current data from astronauts on low earth orbit and Apollo missions provides insight on the risk of CVD from radiation exposure. However, data is limited given the small cohort size of astronauts who embarked on just nine prolonged missions. Therefore, a cerebral approach to understanding and mitigating risks are essential. This paper discusses the need for a predictive preclinical model to help understand and mitigate the effects of radiation on astronauts. We will discuss strengths and limitations of preclinical models and the methods of validating and constructing a model to predict human clinical outcomes. Our bedside-bench-bedside approach focuses on adapting the preclinical model through common investigative tools used between humans and animals. The result will be an optimization of preclinical model to a point of being a surrogate clinical model capable of predicting CVD outcomes in astronauts exposed to radiation.

However, research on the imaging performance of RION is not sufficient. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) early after injury of the optic nerve of rhesus monkeys by a single-dose/fractionation-scheme of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intraorbital optic nerve contour of 5 rhesus monkeys was acquired by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Then, the unilateral intraorbital optic nerves of 5 rhesus monkeys were injured by gamma knife surgery (GKS) with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve). DTI was performed before the irradiation and 1week, 2weeks, 4weeks, and 24weeks after injury to obtain the cross-sectional area, and the fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) values.RESULTS: The cross-sectional area of the injured optic nerve exhibited significant atrophy 24weeks after SRS. FA declined 1week after injury; this value then increased slightly but remained lower than before injury (P<0.05). AD began to decline in the 2weeks after injury and gradually disappeared (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: SRS with a single-dose/fractionation scheme (marginal dose of 15Gy, 50% isodose curve) on the unilateral intraorbital optic nerve can induce RION. DTI can detect RION at an early stage. FA and AD are useful indicators for RION diagnosis. In the early stage, the primary site of RION may be the vascular endothelium.",Included
2418,"Medical Event Management for Future Deep Space Exploration Missions to Mars BACKGROUND: Long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs), such as voyages to Mars, will present unique medical challenges for astronaut crews, including communication delays and the inability to return to Earth early. Medical events threaten crewmember lives and increase the risk of mission failure. Managing a range of potential medical events will require excellent technical and nontechnical skills (NTSs). We sought to identify medical events with potential for rescue, range them according to the potential impact on crew health and mission success during LDEMs, and develop a list of NTSs to train for management of in-flight medical events.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight subject matter experts with specializations in surgery, medicine, trauma, spaceflight operations, NTS training, simulation, human factors, and organizational psychology completed online surveys followed by a 2-d in-person workshop. They identified and rated medical events for survivability, mission impact, and impact of crewmember NTSs on outcomes in space.RESULTS: Sudden cardiac arrest, smoke inhalation, toxic exposure, seizure, and penetrating eye injury emerged as events with the highest potential mission impact, greatest potential for survival, and that required excellent NTS for successful management. Key NTS identified to target in training included information exchange, supporting behavior, communication delivery, and team leadership/followership.CONCLUSIONS: With a planned Mars mission on the horizon, training countermeasures need to be developed in the next 3-5 y. These results may inform policy, selection, medical system design, and training scenarios for astronauts to manage in-flight medical events on LDEMs. Findings may extend to surgical and medical care in any rural and remote location.",Excluded

A two-step procedure was designed to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulus and exogenous gene delivery for inducing neurogenesis. First, an electrical stimulation device was designed using gold nanoparticles adsorbed to the surface of a cover glass. Gold nanoparticles, as an electrical conductor for stem cells, are well-defined particles adsorbed to a polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated cover glass. The nanoparticle morphology was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Second, a plasmid carrying Nurr1 cDNA was complexed with biodegradable poly-(DL)-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles to support neurogenesis. To evaluate the neuronal differentiation of stem cells mediated by the treatment with either electrical stimulation and exogenous Nurr1 gene delivery, or both, the expression of neuron-specific genes and proteins was examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cells transfected with exogenous Nurr1 genes plus electrical stimulation (250 mV for 1000 s) showed the greatest level of neurite outgrowth with a mean neurite length of 150 mum. Neurite length in cells treated with only one stimulus was not significant, approximately 10-20 mum.

Free radicals formation is greatly augmented during ionizing radiation exposure, which causes damage in cerebellum responsible for locomotor activity. Amaranthus paniculatus (Linn.) having high content of beta-carotene (about 15 mg/100g), ascorbic acid, Vitamin C and folate, may prove efficient antioxidants. To evaluate its antioxidative efficacy, healthy Swiss albino mice from an inbred colony were selected and divided into three groups having equal number of male and female in each group. All of these animals were initially trained in Hebb William's Maze, model D(1). After initial training of 10 days, two groups were supplemented with methanolic extract of A. paniculatus (Linn.) at a dose of 600 and 800 mg/kg bw per day, respectively for 15 days. One group without any treatment served as normal. It has been observed that mice, supplemented with extract took lesser time to reach goal than normal (without any treatment). Furthermore after supplementation of Amaranthus, followed by exposure to 9 Gy of gamma radiation by 60Co beam therapy unit, the survived mice took lesser time to reach to their goals than those without plant extract. Control mice (not supplemented with AE extract) showed continuous decline in their learning performance. Mice of Control group died within 12 days after exposure. Irradiated males try to recover from 10th day onwards but they died up to day 12. But in Experimental mice (AE treated), after initial decline in learning ability after exposure, recovery was noticed and not only this 70% of them survived beyond the observation period. Besides male mice showed faster learning ability as compared to females in all groups. After irradiation too, males took lesser time to reach to goals. Learning in all the groups before exposure has been much faster in between 9 and 15 days. After radiation, however it was followed by a sudden spurt and delayed learning response up to 12 days. Recovery was greater in males than females in treated groups. Recovery was greater in males of 600 mg/kg bw per day than other groups.

To benchmark both gel dosimeters, they were exposed to a 6 MV photon beam and the depth dose was compared against a diamond detector measurement that served as golden standard. Both gel dosimeters were found accurate within 4% accuracy. In the 3D dose matrix of the radiochromic gel, hotspot dose deviations up to 8% were observed which are attributed to the fabrication procedure. The polymer gel readout was shown to be sensitive to B0 field and B1 field non-uniformities as well as temperature variations during scanning. The performance of the two gel dosimeters was also evaluated for a brain tumour IMRT treatment. Both gel measured dose distributions were compared against treatment planning system predicted dose maps which were validated independently with ion chamber measurements and portal dosimetry. In the radiochromic gel measurement, two sources of deviations could be identified. Firstly, the dose in a cluster of voxels near the edge of the phantom deviated from the planned dose. Secondly, the presence of dose hotspots in the order of 10% related to inhomogeneities in the gel limit the clinical acceptance of this dosimetry technique. Based on the results of the micelle gel dosimeter prototype presented here, chemical optimization will be subject of future work. Polymer gel dosimetry is capable of measuring the absolute dose in the whole 3D volume within 5% accuracy. A temperature stabilization technique is incorporated to increase the accuracy during short measurements, however keeping the temperature stable during long measurement times in both calibration phantoms and the volumetric phantom is more challenging.

It provides a new type of information in radiotherapy, functional rather than anatomical. PET imaging can also be used for target volume definition in radiotherapy treatment planning. The need for very precise target volume delineation has arisen with the increasing use of sophisticated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy techniques and intensity modulated radiation therapy. It is expected that better delineation of the target volume may lead to a significant reduction in the irradiated volume, thus lowering the risk of treatment complications (smaller safety margins). Better tumour visualisation also allows a higher dose of radiation to be applied to the tumour, which may lead to better tumour control. The aim of this article is to review the possible use of PET imaging in the radiotherapy of various cancers. We focus mainly on non-small cell lung cancer, lymphoma and oesophageal cancer, but also include current opinion on the use of PET-based planning in other tumours including brain, uterine cervix, rectum and prostate.

However, the difference in local tumor progression between patients with 2-4 and those with 5-10 BMs has not been sufficiently examined for this data set. Thus, the authors reappraised this issue, employing the updated JLGK0901 data set with detailed observation via enhanced MRI. They applied sophisticated statistical methods to analyze the data. METHODS This was a prospective observational study of 1194 patients harboring 1-10 BMs treated with GKRS alone. Patients were categorized into groups A (single BM, 455 cases), B (2-4 BMs, 531 cases), and C (5-10 BMs, 208 cases). Local tumor progression was defined as a 20% increase in the maximum diameter of the enhanced lesion as compared to its smallest documented maximum diameter on enhanced MRI. The authors compared cumulative incidence differences determined by competing risk analysis and also conducted propensity score matching. RESULTS Local tumor progression was observed in 212 patients (17.8% overall, groups A/B/C: 93/89/30 patients). Cumulative incidences of local tumor progression in groups A, B, and C were 15.2%, 10.6%, and 8.7% at 1 year after GKRS; 20.1%, 16.9%, and 13.5% at 3 years; and 21.4%, 17.4%, and not available at 5 years, respectively. There were no significant differences in local tumor progression between groups B and C. Local tumor progression was classified as tumor recurrence in 139 patients (groups A/B/C: 68/53/18 patients), radiation necrosis in 67 (24/31/12), and mixed/ undetermined lesions in 6 (1/5/0). There were no significant differences in tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis between groups B and C. Multivariate analysis using the Fine-Gray proportional hazards model revealed age < 65 years, neurological symptoms, tumor volume >= 1 cm<sup>3</sup>, and prescription dose < 22 Gy to be significant poor prognostic factors for local tumor progression. In the subset of 558 case-matched patients (186 in each group), there were no significant differences between groups B and C in local tumor progression, nor in tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis. CONCLUSIONS Local tumor progression incidences did not differ between groups B and C. This study proved that tumor progression after GKRS without whole-brain radiation therapy for patients with 5-10 BMs was satisfactorily treated with the doses prescribed according to the JLGK0901 study protocol and that results were not inferior to those in patients with a single or 2-4 BMs. Copyright © AANS 2020, except where prohibited by US copyright law.",Excluded

The intracranial internal carotid artery was not within the irradiation field; therefore it was obvious that the development of MMD was not caused by the direct effect of radiation in the current case study. Moreover, we demonstrated the decrease in velocity in the internal carotid artery prior to the development of MMD using phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography. Previous studies demonstrated that progression of the pathological condition in the cerebral arteries in response to hemodynamic changes is enhanced in patients with RNF213 variants.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the changes in the intracranial hemodynamics after SRS for AVM could trigger the de novo onset of MMD in patients with a genetic predisposition for the RNF213 variant.",Excluded

1749,"Inactivation and block of calcium channels by photo-released Ca2+ in dorsal root ganglion neurons Calcium channels are inactivated by voltage and intracellular calcium. To study the kinetics and the mechanism of calcium-induced inactivation of calcium channels, a ""caged"" calcium compound, dimethoxy-nitrophen was used to photo-release about 50 microM calcium ion within 0.2 millisecond in dorsal root ganglion neurons. When divalent cations were the charge carriers, intracellular photo-release of calcium inactivated the calcium channel with an invariant rate [time constant (tau) approximately equal to 7 milliseconds]. When the monovalent cation sodium was the charge carrier, photorelease of calcium inside or outside of the cell blocked the channel rapidly (tau approximately equal to 0.4 millisecond), but the block was greater from the external side. Thus the kinetics of calcium-induced calcium channel inactivation depends on the valency of the permeant cation. The data imply that calcium channels exist in either of two conformational states, the calcium- and sodium-permeant forms, or, alternatively, calcium-induced inactivation occurs at a site closely associated with the internal permeating site.",Excluded
366,"Comprehensive analysis of the role of DNA repair gene polymorphisms on risk of glioma Much of the variation in inherited risk of glioma is likely to be explained by combinations of common low risk variants. The established relationship between glioma risk and exposure to ionizing radiation led us to examine whether variants in the DNA repair genes contribute to disease susceptibility. We evaluated 1127 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) supplemented with 388 putative functional SNPs to capture most of the common variation in 136 DNA repair genes, in five unique case-control series from four different countries (1013 cases, 1016 controls). We identified 16 SNPs associated with glioma risk at the 1% significance level. The highest association observed across the five independent case-control datasets involved rs243356, which maps to intron 3 of CHAF1A (trend odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.54; P = 0.0002; false-positive report probability = 0.055, based on a prior probability of 0.01). Our results provide additional support for the hypothesis that low penetrance variants contribute to the risk of developing glioma and suggest that a genetic variant located in or around the CHAF1A gene contributes to disease risk.",Excluded

378,"ATM kinase inhibition preferentially sensitizes p53-mutant glioma to ionizing radiation PURPOSE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain cancer with a median survival of only 12 to 15 months. Current standard treatment consists of surgery followed by chemoradiation. The poor survival of patients with GBM is due to aggressive tumor invasiveness, an inability to remove all tumor tissue, and an innate tumor chemo- and radioresistance. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is an excellent target for radiosensitizing GBM because of its critical role in regulating the DNA damage response and p53, among other cellular processes. As a first step toward this goal, we recently showed that the novel ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019 reduced migration, invasion, and growth, and potently radiosensitized human glioma cells in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using orthotopic xenograft models of GBM, we now show that KU-60019 is also an effective radiosensitizer in vivo. Human glioma cells expressing reporter genes for monitoring tumor growth and dispersal were grown intracranially, and KU-60019 was administered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery or osmotic pump.RESULTS: Our results show that the combined effect of KU-60019 and radiation significantly increased survival of mice 2- to 3-fold over controls. Importantly, we show that glioma with mutant p53 is much more sensitive to KU-60019 radiosensitization than genetically matched wild-type glioma.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that an ATM kinase inhibitor may be an effective radiosensitizer and adjuvant therapy for patients with mutant p53 brain cancers.",Excluded

The quadriceps VA level, motor-evoked potential (MEP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were tested before and after 30 minutes of low-intensity electrical stimulation (ES).Results: Before ES, the quadriceps VA in the ACL lesion legs of the ACL group was lower compared to the legs of the healthy control group (P < 0.05). The MEP sizes in the ACL lesion legs and the healthy control were not significantly different. The ACL lesion legs showed lower SICI and higher ICF compared to the healthy control group (P < 0.05). After ES, the quadriceps VA level increased and the SICI-ICF was modulated only in the ACL lesion legs (P < 0.05) but not in the healthy controls.Conclusions: Low-intensity ES can normalize the modulation of intracortical inhibition and facilitation, thereby ameliorating the activation failure in individuals with ACL lesion.",Excluded

In a mouse model, tumor and critical organ-absorbed doses delivered by different radioimmunoconjugates were calculated and compared. We used a Medical Internal Radiation Dosimetry (MIRD)-style mouse dosimetry model that incorporates cross-organ beta doses to make refined estimates of the radiation absorbed dose to tissues. Biodistribution data from neuroblastoma xenografted nude mice were used to estimate tumor, organ and bone marrow absorbed dose values for 90Y-3F8, 131I-3F8 and 131I-F(ab')2 fragments. Immunoreactive fractions of the radiolabeled antibodies were comparable. Although tumor uptake of the radioiodinated and radiometal labeled 3F8 was much higher than that of the radioiodinated F(ab')2 fragments (maximum percent injected dose per gram values were 39.4, 33.2 and 20.1 for 131I-3F8, 90Y-3F8 and 131I-F(ab')2, respectively), tumor to nontumor ratios were higher for radioiodinated fragments (with the exception of tumor to kidney ratio). For the minimum tumor dose necessary for complete ablation, the bone marrow received 195, 278 and 401 cGy for 131I-F(ab')2, 131I-3F8 and 90Y-3F8, respectively.

477,"Single fraction prophylactic cranial irradiation for small cell carcinoma of the lung The effectiveness of a single 8-Gy fraction prophylactic cranial irradiation regime was assessed in 106 patients with small-cell carcinoma of the lung. All patients had limited stage disease and received combination chemotherapy consisting of either cisplatin or carboplatin with ifosfamide, etoposide, and vincristine (VICE). Cranial irradiation was administered 48 h after the first cycle of chemotherapy and was well tolerated. Actual 2-year survival was 35% and cranial relapse occurred in 22% of those patients who achieved complete remission. This compares favourably with a cranial relapse rate of 45% incomplete remitters previously reported with the same chemotherapy regime after a minimum follow-up of 2 years where PCI was not used. Formal psychometric testing was performed retrospectively on a series of 25 long-term survivors of whom 14 were taken from this reported series. Whilst 75% of patients were impaired on at least one test with 68% performing badly in the most complex task, this was not associated with clinically detectable neurological damage and the patients did not complain of memory or concentration difficulties. In conclusion, single fraction PCI, when used with platinum based combination chemotherapy, appears to be equally effective but may be less neurotoxic than the more standard fractionated regimes.",Excluded
822,"The possibility of surgery for small cell lung cancer (state of art). [Hungarian] The author provides information about epidemiology as well as surgical practice for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in Hungary. It is emphasized that, based on the author's experience and on international consensus, TNM system is the basis of accurate oncological treatment. The oncological management of SCLC is summarized, which is based on surgery. SCLC, especially cases undergoing surgery, are often detected as a peripheral nodule which should be examined preoperatively by special algorithm. Despite the published favorable results, surgical treatment alone is not accepted nowadays as a correct oncological point of view. The aim of adjuvant therapy is to improve survival and to decrease local recurrence. The 5-year survival of SCLC according to stages is between 4 and 60%. After the late 80's, the complex multimodality oncotherapy has started, with neoadjuvant treatment. SCLC is chemosensitive, even at N2 stage after down-staging surgery might be available. The late results show 20-46% cumulative 5-year survival rate. However, in the case of N2 disease, only 15-30% 5-year survival is achieved. This is a critical question for surgery of SCLC, because the dominant opinion is that for N2 disease and especially residual N2 surgery does not prolong survival. SCLC often occurs in combination with NSCLC. Therefore, salvage operation is a possible choice to remove the residual chemo/radiation resistant SCLC and NSCLC components. In conclusion, surgery has an advantage for SCLC therapy especially in patients with stage I-II disease. Value of surgery for stage III/a disease is under discussion and it is not recommended in Hungarian practice. To use a complex neoadjuvant protocol is advised which provides from 20 up to 40% five-year survival rate.",Excluded

Type D IOLs (biconvex, posterior more curved) had the largest spherical aberration. The correlation between glare disability and spherical aberration was statistically significant for types A, B and C (equiconvex) IOLs. There was no correlation between glare disability and spherical aberration for Type D IOLs, although they showed the smallest glare disability of the four types.

3276,"Extended adjuvant temozolomide improves survival in a glioblastoma mouse model Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients in conjunction with ionizing radiation (IR) or as an adjuvant agent. Yet the prognosis of GBM remains devastating with a median survival of 14 months. We investigated whether extended TMZ treatment cycles would provide survival benefit for GBM patients. To recapitulate the genomic and pathological heterogeneity found in GBM patients, we utilized patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. We demonstrated that the combination of TMZ and IR prevents tumor progression, but tumors ultimately recur and lead to death. Overall survival was prolonged when adjuvant TMZ treatment was administered with minimal toxicity. Additionally, development of resistance to TMZ and IR was often correlated with an increase in levels of MGMT protein, irrespective of the promoter methylation status. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of a voxel-based MRI biomarker, the functional diffusion map (fDM), as an imaging surrogate to detect spatially varying changes in tumor response, as well as a more sensitive predictor of overall response versus whole-volume tumor measurements. The fDM biomarker was also useful as an early predictor of impeding resistance to TMZ and IR. In summary, we demonstrate that prolonged TMZ treatment should be considered for the treatment of GBM patients. Furthermore, MRI based imaging allows early prediction of therapy response as well as impeding resistance.",Excluded
3096,"Treatment of multifocal intracranial progression of adenocarinoma of the lung with high-dose pulsed erlotinib complicated by hemorrhage and generalized cerebral edema Background: The development of isolated intracranial metastases is increasingly recognized as a relevant clinical problem in patients who respond well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Single case reports of successful and well-tolerated treatment with high-dose, pulsed erlotinib have been published. (Hata et al, JTO 2011; Dhruva and Socinski, JCO 2009) Methods: We analyze the course of patient who developed intracranial hemorrhage and generalized cerebral edema during treatment with high-dose erlotinib. Result(s): A 44 year old Caucasian female neversmoker presented in 12/08 with left arm weakness. Computed tomography (CT) revealed several brain lesions, and a mass in the right lung. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed metastases in the liver and right kidney. Following bronchoscopic biopsy, adenocarcinoma of the lung, clinical stage IV, was diagnosed. Whole brain irradiation (35 Gy) and three cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 75mg/ m2 and pemetrexed 500mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks) led to a partial response; however, during the fifth cycle a clear progression occurred. A pulmonary embolus was treated with tinzaparin (10,000 I.U. sc od). Genetic analyses showed an activating mutation in EGFR exon 19, and treatment with erlotinib was initiated. This led to regression of all tumor sites, including the kidney. After 13 months of erlotinib, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed progression of the cerebral metastases. The primary tumor and intraabdominal metastases were stable, and so the intracerebral metastases were stereotactiacally irradiated. Three months later one further metastasis was irradiated, however multifocal intracranial progression soon developed. A neurosurgical biopsy showed the same mutation as in the primary tumor, with no known resistance mutations. High dose pulsed erlotinib was added (600 mg q 4d). After 2 weeks hemorrhage into three of the metastases (before hemorrhage: 35x27mm, 11x19mm, 9x8mm) occurred. Anticoagulants were stopped, and due to 6mm midline shift the largest hematoma (35 x 23 mm) was evacuated. MRI showed a trend to partial response in the other intracerebral metastases and so the erlotinib pulses were continued with a 25% dose reduction. Unfortunately, 24 days later, cerebral edema and subdural hygroma developed and the patient died, 24 months after initial diagnosis. Conclusion(s): Brain metastases despite systemic control increasingly pose a problem (Lee et al., Cancer, 2010). Inadequate dosing across the blood brain barrier is one explanation, but has not been proven. The absence of resistance mutations, as well as the multifocal nature of the intracerebral progression, support this theory in our case. The efficacy of high dose erlotinib for brain metastases has been previously reported. Previous reports describe minimal toxicity during treatment. The significant multi-focal hemorrhage and cerebral edema which developed in our patient have not been previously described in this setting. Simultaneous anticoagulation as well as previous stereotactic radiation of the brain metastases may have predisposed our patient to hemorrhage, and may prove to be relative contraindications to high-dose pulsed erlotinib. Because most centers only see a few patients in this clinical situation, cooperative efforts are needed to collect and analyze these cases, and to develop appropriate treatment strategies.",Excluded

The purpose of our study was to determine the potential of echo planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting subacute radiation induced injury to the normal brain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with brain metastases and three patients with lung cancer underwent cranial irradiation. These patients were subjected to 3D-EPSI and DTI at two time points (pre-radiation, and 1 month post-irradiation). Parametric maps of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated and co-registered to post-contrast T1-weighted images. Normal appearing gray-matter and white-matter regions were compared between the two time points to assess sub-acute effects of radiation using independent sample t-tests.RESULTS: Significantly increased MD (P = .02), Cho/Cr (P = .02) and a trend towards a decrease in NAA/Cr (P = .06) was observed from the hippocampus. Significant decrease in FA (P = .02) from the centrum-semiovale and a significant increase in MD (P = .04) and Cho/Cr (P = .02) from genu of corpus-callosum was also observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that 3D-EPSI and DTI may provide quantitative measures of radiation induced injury to the normal brain.",Excluded

This method uses synchrotron-generated x-ray microbeams. Rats were implanted with 9L gliosarcomas and the tumors were diagnosed by MRI. They were irradiated 14 days after implantation by arrays of 25 microm wide microbeams in unidirectional mode, with a skin entrance dose of 625 Gy. The effect of using 200 or 100 microm center-to-center spacing between the microbeams was compared. The median survival time (post-implantation) was 40 and 67 days at 200 and 100 microm spacing, respectively. However, 72% of rats irradiated at 100 microm spacing showed abnormal clinical signs and weight patterns, whereas only 12% of rats were affected at 200 microm spacing. In parallel, histological lesions of the normal brain were found in the 100 microm series only. Although the increase in lifespan was equal to 273% and 102% for the 100 and 200 microm series, respectively, the 200 microm spacing protocol provides a better sparing of healthy tissue and may prove useful in combination with other radiation modalities or additional drugs.",Included

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to have a large gross target volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) due to its biological characteristics. More than one isocenter may be needed when small MLCs (i.e., BrainLAB M3, whose largest field is 10 x 10 cm(2)) are used to treat the nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The BrainLAB IMRT system was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-isocenter IMRT plan for treating nasopharyngeal cancers. Dose coverage of GTVs and CTVs were compared among IMRT plans with 1, 2 and 3 isocenters, as were dose objectives for OARs including brainstem, cord, and parotids. The dosimetric variation and the delivery time were also measured with a phantom. IMRT plans with more than 1 isocenter achieved a better dose coverage, homogeneity, and conformity on GTVs and CTVs; however, with risk of higher doses given to OARs. In most cases, one can generate satisfactory IMRT plans using the 2-isocenter IMRT planning strategy.

Although calcium signaling has a critical role in control of EC neuronal functions, however, it is still unclear whether the ELF-EMF exposure affects the EC neuronal calcium homeostasis. In the present study, using whole-cell recording and calcium imaging, we record the whole-cell inward currents that contain the voltage-gated calcium currents and show that ELF-EMF (50Hz, 1mT or 3mT, lasting 24h) exposure does not influence these currents. Next, we specifically isolate the high-voltage activated (HVA) and low-voltage activated (LVA) calcium channels-induced currents. Similarly, the activation and inactivation characteristics of these membrane calcium channels are also not influenced by ELF-EMF. Importantly, ELF-EMF exposure reduces the maximum amplitude of the high-K(+)-evoked calcium elevation in EC neurons, which is abolished by thapsigargin, a Ca(2+) ATPase inhibitor, to empty the intracellular calcium stores of EC neurons. Together, these findings indicate that ELF-EMF exposure specifically influences the intracellular calcium dynamics of cultural EC neurons via a calcium channel-independent mechanism.",Excluded

696,"Contrasting the effects of proton irradiation on dendritic complexity of subiculum neurons in wild type and MCAT mice Growing evidence suggests that radiation-induced oxidative stress directly affects a wide range of biological changes with an overall negative impact on CNS function. In the past we have demonstrated that transgenic mice over-expressing human catalase targeted to the mitochondria (MCAT) exhibit a range of neuroprotective phenotypes following irradiation that include improved neurogenesis, dendritic complexity, and cognition. To determine the extent of the neuroprotective phenotype afforded by MCAT expression in different hippocampal regions, we analyzed subiculum neurons for changes in neuronal structure and synaptic integrity after exposure to low dose (0.5 Gy) 150 MeV proton irradiation. One month following irradiation of WT and MCAT mice, a range of morphometric parameters were quantified along Golgi-Cox impregnated neurons. Compared with WT mice, subiculum neurons from MCAT mice exhibited increased trends (albeit not statistically significant) toward increased dendritic complexity in both control and irradiated cohorts. However, Sholl analysis of MCAT mice revealed significantly increased arborization of the distal dendritic tree, indicating a protective effect on secondary and tertiary branching. Interestingly, radiation-induced increases in postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95) puncta were not as pronounced in MCAT compared with WT mice, and were significantly lower after the 0.5 Gy dose. As past data has linked radiation exposure to reduced dendritic complexity, elevated PSD-95 and impaired cognition, reductions in mitochondrial oxidative stress have proven useful in ameliorating many of these radiation-induced sequelae. Data presented here shows similar trends, and again points to the potential benefits of reducing oxidative stress in the brain to attenuate radiation injury. Environ. Mol.

1380,"Role of the Toll Like receptor (TLR) radical cycle in chronic inflammation: possible treatments targeting the TLR4 pathway Activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex, a receptor of the innate immune system, may underpin the pathophysiology of many human diseases, including asthma, cardiovascular disorder, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune disorders, neuroinflammatory disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, clinical depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, alcohol abuse, and toluene inhalation. TLRs are pattern recognition receptors that recognize damage-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria. Here we focus on the environmental factors, which are known to trigger TLR4, e.g., ozone, atmosphere particulate matter, long-lived reactive oxygen intermediate, pentachlorophenol, ionizing radiation, and toluene. Activation of the TLR4 pathways may cause chronic inflammation and increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and oxidative and nitrosative stress and therefore TLR-related diseases. This implies that drugs or substances that modify these pathways may prevent or improve the abovementioned diseases. Here we review some of the most promising drugs and agents that have the potential to attenuate TLR-mediated inflammation, e.g., anti-LPS strategies that aim to neutralize LPS (synthetic anti-LPS peptides and recombinant factor C) and TLR4/MyD88 antagonists, including eritoran, CyP, EM-163, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, 6-shogaol, cinnamon extract, N-acetylcysteine, melatonin, and molecular hydrogen.

Whole body <sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation impacted contextual but not cued fear freezing and the percentage of Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades. In mice tested for contextual freezing, there was a correlation between Arc-positive cells in the enclosed and free blades.

The indications and results of stereotactic radiosurgery are not well documented.METHODS: We reviewed our 10-year experience in the management of 17 patients who had jugular foramen schwannomas managed with the gamma knife. Thirteen patients previously had undergone surgery (range, 1-6 resections). Four patients had multiple cranial nerve deficits before microsurgical resection; 12 developed multiple lower cranial nerve palsies after resection. Four patients underwent radiosurgery based on imaging criteria alone. Conformal dose planning (tumor margin dose of 12-18 Gy) successfully encompassed the irregular tumor volumes in all patients.RESULTS: Follow-up varied from 6 to 74 months. Tumor size decreased in eight patients, remained stable in eight, and increased in one patient during the average follow-up interval of 3.5 years. Six patients improved and 10 others retained their preradiosurgery clinical status. One patient had an increase in tumor size and clinical deterioration 6 months after radiosurgery and underwent microsurgical resection. No patient developed new cranial nerve or other neurological deficits after radiosurgery.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that gamma knife radiosurgery is an effective alternative to microsurgical resection for patients who have small tumors and intact lower cranial nerve function. It is also effective for patients who have residual or recurrent tumors after microsurgical resection.",Excluded
1818,"Radiation-induced cerebral aneurysm successfully treated with endovascular coil embolization In a 30-year-old male, multiple cerebral aneurysms developed 19 years after receiving 60 Gy of irradiation for craniophariginoma. Angiogram revealed right IC-PC and upper basilar trunk aneurysms in addition to atherosclerotic change. The right IC-PC aneurysm was wrapped and the basilar trunk aneurysm located between the origins of SCA and AICA was treated by endovascular coil embolization. The packing of the aneurysm was complete, but stenosis of the basilar artery appeared. The patient was discharged uneventfully and follow-up angiogram 6 months later demonstrated that the aneurysm had disappeared and the patency of the basilary artery had been preserved. Radiation-induced intracranial vasculopathy is a well-recognized phenomenon, but aneurysm formation is less common than arterial occlusive lesion. However, the mortality rate after bleeding is so high that immediate diagnosis and treatment by direct surgery or coil embolization are necessary.",Excluded
192,"Visual outcome after fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy of benign anterior skull base tumors To determine visual outcome including the occurrence of radiation induced optic neuropathy (RION) as well as tumor control after fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) of benign anterior skull base meningiomas or pituitary adenomas. Thirty-nine patients treated with FSRT for anterior skull base meningiomas and 55 patients treated with FSRT for pituitary adenomas between January 1999 and December 2009 with at least 2 years follow-up were included. Patients were followed up prospectively with magnetic resonance imaging scans, visual acuity and visual field examinations. RION was found in four (10%) patients with anterior skull base meningiomas and seven patients (13%) with pituitary adenomas. The five-year actuarial freedom from 25% RION visual field loss was 94% following FSRT. Actuarial 2-, 5- and 10-year tumor control rates were 100, 88.4 and 64.5% for anterior skull base meningiomas and 100, 98.2 and 94.9% for pituitary adenomas, respectively. Patients with an impaired visual field function pre-FSRT were more likely to experience worsened function (p = 0.016). We found that RION, was a relatively uncommon event, in a large prospective cohort of patients that were systematically monitored following FSRT of benign anterior skull base tumors. Long term tumor control was favorable, especially for pituitary adenomas.",Excluded
1861,"The Effects of Low-Dose-Rate gamma-irradiation on Forced Swim Test-Induced Immobility and Oxidative Stress in Mice The forced swim test (FST) induces immobility in mice. Low-dose (high-dose-rate) X-irradiation inhibits FSTinduced immobility in mice due to its antioxidative function. We evaluated the effects of low-dose gamma-irradiation at a low-dose-rate on the FST-induced depletion of antioxidants in mouse organs. Mice received whole-body low-dose-rate (0.6 or 3.0 mGy/h) of low-dose gamma-irradiation for 1 week, followed by daily FSTs (5 days). The immobility rate on day 2 compared to day 1 was significantly lower in the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice than in sham irradiated mice. The FST significantly decreased the catalase (CAT) activity and total glutathione (t-GSH) content in the brain and kidney, respectively. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and t-GSH content in the liver of the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice were significantly lower than those of the non-FST-treated mice. The CAT activity in the lungs of mice exposed to 3.0 mGy/h gamma-irradiation was higher than that of non-FST treated mice and mice treated with FST. However, no significant differences were observed in the levels of these antioxidant markers between the sham and irradiated groups except for the CAT activity in lungs. These findings suggest that the effects of low-dose-rate and low-dose gamma-irradiation on FST are highly organ-dependent.",Included
1662,"Yttrium-90 Radioembolization for Liver Metastasis From Neuroendocrine Cancer: A Single-Institution Retrospective Review Purpose: Many publications can be found on the use of yttrium-90 (Y-90) transarterial radioembolization (TARE) for the treatment of primary liver cancer or liver metastasis from colorectal adenocarcinoma. It is important to study the results that could be achieved when TARE is being used to treat liver metastasis of other origin. This retrospective analysis concentrates on our institutional experience with TARE for the treatment of liver metastasis from neuroendocrine cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Our institutional review board (IRB)-approved Y-90 databank was reviewed to identify patients with neuroendocrine cancer who received Y-90 TARE for liver metastasis from February 2011 to September 2013. Information on patient demographics, performance status, disease-related characteristics (liver panel, complete blood count [CBC], chromogranin A, and gross tumor volume [GTV] measured in cc on the most recent study pre-TARE), treatment-related parameters (Y-90 dose delivered), and treatment outcome (treatment toxicity, overall survival [OS]) were captured for this analysis. Result(s): Between February 2011 and September 2013, a total of 16 patients with metastatic neuroendocrine (liver-predominant disease) received Y-90 TARE in our institution. Eight of these patients received treatment to both liver lobes, for a total of 24 procedures. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status between 0 and 2 prior to treatment. In addition, all patients had a bilirubin level below 2.0 and an albumin level above 3.0 prior to treatment. The median GTV per lobe was 299 cc (range: 27-670 cc). With a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range: 2-26 mo), the 1-year OS was 75%. There was no relationship between OS and GTV volume. Two patients with severe endocrine disorders that required repeated hospitalization (one patient with severe hypoglycemia and a second patient with hypertensive crisis) responded well to TARE, with marked improvement in their medical condition and no need for further admission postprocedure. In terms of treatment toxicity, one patient was diagnosed with a radiation-induced liver disease and died 13 months post-treatment. One patient developed a pancytopenia that was potentially related to treatment. Conclusion(s): The use of Y-90 TARE for patients with liver metastasis from neuroendocrine carcinoma is a treatment option that should be assessed in a prospective multicentric study. In this series, Y-90 TARE was associated with a high 1-year survival rate. However, patients need to be monitored closely postprocedure, since serious treatment-related toxicity could develop.",Excluded
1236,"Radiation therapy for the palliation of multiple myeloma Purpose: This study reviews the experience at the University of Arizona in an effort to define the minimum effective radiation dose for durable pain relief in the majority of patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma. Methods and Materials: The records of 101 patients with multiple myeloma irradiated for palliation at the University of Arizona between 1975 and 1990 were reviewed. Three hundred sixteen sites were treated. Ten sites were asymptomatic, including six hemibody fields with advanced disease unresponsive to chemotherapy and four local fields with impending pathological fractures. Three hundred six evaluable symptomatic sites remained. The most common symptom was bone pain. Other symptoms included neurological impairment and a palpable mass. Result(s): Total tumor dose ranged from 3.0 to 60 Gy, with a mean of 25 Gy. Symptom relief was obtained in 297 of 306 evaluable symptomatic sites (97%). Complete relief of symptoms was obtained in 26% and partial relief in 71%. Symptom relief was obtained in 92% of sites receiving a total dose less than 10 Gy (n = 13) and 98% of sites receiving 10 Gy or more (n = 293). No dose-response could be demonstrated. The likelihood of symptom relief was not influenced by the location of the lesion or the use of concurrent chemotherapy. Of the 297 responding sites, 6% (n = 19) relapsed after a median symptom-free interval of 16 months. Neither the probability of relapse nor the time to relapse was related to the radiation dose. Retreatment of relapsing sites provided effective palliation in all cases. Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy is effective in palliating local symptoms in multiple myeloma. A total dose of 10 Gy should provide durable symptom relief in the majority of patients.",Excluded
1146,"The Safety of CT-Guided Epidural Steroid Injections in an Older Patient Cohort BACKGROUND: Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are a common method for treating lower back pain, which is one of the most prevalent health-related complaints in the adult US population. Although the safety of CT-guided ESIs has been extensively studied in adults, there is limited data concerning the procedure's safety profile in an older patient population.OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study analyzed safety data among a single-center cohort of patients > 65 years-old who received one or more CT-guided interlaminar ESIs from 2012 to 2015.STUDY DESIGN: An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved retrospective chart review.SETTING: University hospital center.METHODS: A total of 688 CT-guided ESI procedures were evaluated and a linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between dose length product (DLP), body mass index (BMI), procedure duration, and kVp/mA settings. Further analysis was performed on a sample of long procedure time, average-DLP and high-DLP procedures.RESULTS: Average age was 75.77 years, with 44% having a BMI > 30. The mean DLP was 55.58 mGy x cm and the mean procedure duration was 5.94 minutes. All procedures were technically successful and no complications were observed during or after any of the procedures, including at one-month follow-up office visits. The kVp and mA settings were the strongest predictors of DLP, followed by procedure time. The high-DLP cases had a greater number of needle placement series, more intervertebral disc spaces included in each planning series and higher machine settings (kVp 120; mA 87.5) than the average-DLP cases (kVp 100; mA 49.9).LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by its retrospective design.CONCLUSION: CT-guided interlaminar ESIs can be performed safely, with low procedure times, relatively low DLP's and without complications in an older patient population.

255,"The effects of a spaceflight analog with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on sensorimotor adaptation Aboard the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts must adapt to altered vestibular and somatosensory inputs due to microgravity. Sensorimotor adaptation on Earth is often studied with a task that introduces visuomotor conflict. Retention of the adaptation process, known as savings, can be measured when subjects are exposed to the same adaptive task multiple times. It is unclear how adaptation demands found on the ISS might interfere with the ability to adapt to other sensory conflict at the same time. In the present study, we investigated the impact of 30 days' head-down tilt bed rest combined with elevated carbon dioxide (HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>) as a spaceflight analog on sensorimotor adaptation. Eleven subjects used a joystick to move a cursor to targets presented on a computer screen under veridical cursor feedback and 45degree rotated feedback. During this NASA campaign, five individuals presented with optic disk edema, a sign of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). Thus, we also performed post hoc exploratory analyses between subgroups who did and did not show signs of SANS. HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> had some impact on sensorimotor adaptation, with a lack of savings across the whole group. SANS individuals showed larger, more persistent after-effects, suggesting a shift from relying on cognitive to more implicit processing of adaptive behaviors. Overall, these findings suggest that HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> alters the way in which individuals engage in sensorimotor processing. These findings have important implications for missions and mission training, which require individuals to adapt to altered sensory inputs over long periods in space. <b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This is the first bed rest campaign examining sensorimotor adaptation and savings in response to the combined effect of HDBR + CO2 and to observe signs of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) in HDBR participants. Our findings suggest that HDBR + CO2 alters the way that individuals engage in sensorimotor processing. Individuals who developed signs of SANS seem to rely more on implicit rather than cognitive processing of adaptive behaviors than subjects who did not present signs of SANS.",Excluded

Movement restriction (40 min) induced c-Fos protein expression primarily in cells with 10-50 mum<sup>2</sup> sizes (associative type neurons) only in anterior hypothalamic nucleus and lateral hypothalamic area; while additional EHF-irradiation of acupuncture projection areas (under movement restriction) induced c-Fos expression in all hypothalamic structures and mostly in cells with 70-150 mum<sup>2</sup> sizes (relay type neurons), i.e. changed the pattern of activated cell type distribution.

606,"Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in radiation-induced cerebral necrosis. Apparent diffusion coefficient in lesion components OBJECTIVE: The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the diffusivity of different components of radiation-induced cerebral necrosis with the hypothesis that the diffusivity of the various components is elevated to different degrees.METHODS: Twenty-two patients (18 men, 4 women, aged 34-72 years) with radiation injury to the temporal lobes after radiation therapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with diagnosis confirmed on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were studied with coronal T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Using three diffusion directions for diffusion-weighted MRI, the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of the enhanced component, the cystic or liquefied component, and the edema component were measured.RESULTS: ADCs of all components of RT-induced cerebral necrosis (154 +/- 21.6 x 10(-5) mm2/s for contrast-enhanced component; 188 +/- 47.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s for cystic/liquefied component; 177 +/- 35.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s for edema component) were all significantly higher (P<0.00001) than ADC of the normal frontal lobe white matter (82 +/- 12.4 x 10(-5) mm2/s). The ADC of the enhanced component was significantly lower than that of the cystic/liquefied component (P=0.0096) and the edema component (P=0.003). A significantly lower ADC was shown in the enhanced component in temporal lobes showing both short-term morphologic deterioration (P=0.024) and occurrence of deterioration on long-term follow-up (P=0.04) compared with the temporal lobes that showed improvement or stable morphology.CONCLUSIONS: ADCs of the contrast-enhanced component, cystic/liquefied component, and edema in RT-induced cerebral necrosis was significantly higher than in normal brain parenchyma.

2646,"Phase I trial of escalated doses of targeted marrow/lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) delivered by tomotherapy combined with etoposide and cyclophosphamide; an allogeneic HCT preparative regimen for patients with refractory leukemia Introduction: The overall survival (OS) for relapsed (RL) acute leukemia patients or those considered induction failure (IF) treated with HCT is 16-19% (Duval et al., JCO 2010). While randomized studies have shown a dose response relationship, with higher doses of radiation resulting in decreased relapse, this benefit is off set by increased treatment related mortality. Materials (or patients) and Methods: To explore the safety and tolerability of targeted radiation treatment in the context of HCT, a phase I trial is being conducted in which escalated doses of targeted whole body radiation is delivered to marrow bearing and lymphoid areas, while sparing non hematopoietic (vital) organs. The transplant preparative regimen is as follows: TMLI on days -10 to -6; etoposide 60mg/kg [adj bw] on day -5 with cyclophosphamide 100mg/kg [ideal bw] on day -3. The radiation dose was started at 1200cGy delivered in 150 cGy fractions twice a day. Initially the dose of radiation was escalated in increments of 150 cGy to 1500 cGy using standard 3x3 design and then 100 cGy incrementally to a maximum of 2000 cGy using rolling 6 design. Dose limiting toxicity is defined according to the Bearman and CTCAE 3.0 (for hematologic toxicity) scales. Liver and brain dose was kept at 1200 cGy. Median normal organs received 16-60% of the marrow dose (lung 44%, esophagus 33% and oral cavity 28%). All patients received peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and sirolimus. Result(s): To date, a total of 41 patients have been transplanted; from 3/14/2008 to 10/3/2013. Patient characteristics: AML n=27, ALL Ph- n=10, ALL Ph+ n=2, Biphenotypic n=2; disease status at HCT, 1RL n=13, 2RL n=2, IF n=26; cytogenetic risk(SWOG criteria): intermediate n=19, unfavorable n=15 and unknown significance n=7 median KPS at HCT 90 (60-100); donor source sibling n=20, HLA matched unrelated n=5, mismatched (1 allele) unrelated n=16; WBC at HCT median 1.5 (0.1-14.9) % blasts (blood) at HCT median 2% (0-85%) % blasts (marrow) at HCT median 46% (10-90%) Two patients presented with extramedullary disease at time of HCT. With a median follow-up for alive patients of 9.9 months (1.0- 53.4), the OS and cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 1 year are 52% (95%CI: 32.9-68.1) and 45% (95%CI: 30.9-65.5) respectively. Two patients are currently being treated at 1900 cGy dose, MTD has not been declared. All patients treated at >= 1700 cGy achieved CR at the day 30 post transplant evaluation. Twenty (49%) of patients developed acute GvHD; 6(30%) of these developed grades 3-4. The day 30 and day 100 NRM was 0% and 5.3% respectively. The most common toxicity across the dose levels tested is grade 1 GI and grade 2 stomatitis (Bearman Scale). Causes of death were disease progression/persistent disease n=14, GvHD n=1 and infection n=1. Discussion(s): These results are encouraging and suggest that 1) doses of TMLI can be safely escalated to 1800 cGy in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide (MTD not reached, dose escalation will continue to 2000 cGy); 2) all patients treated with >=1700 cGy achieved a CR at the day 30 evaluation and that 3) a reduction in relapse/progression compared to published reports can be achieved without increasing NRM using targeted whole body radiation in this high risk population.",Excluded

2385,"Posture, locomotion, spatial orientation, and motion sickness as a function of space flight This article summarizes a variety of newly published findings obtained by the Neuroscience Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, and attempts to place this work within a historical framework of previous results on posture, locomotion, motion sickness, and perceptual responses that have been observed in conjunction with space flight. In this context, we have taken the view that correct transduction and integration of signals from all sensory systems is essential to maintaining stable vision, postural and locomotor control, and eye-hand coordination as components of spatial orientation. The plasticity of the human central nervous system allows individuals to adapt to altered stimulus conditions encountered in a microgravity environment. However, until some level of adaptation is achieved, astronauts and cosmonauts often experience space motion sickness, disturbances in motion control and eye-hand coordination, unstable vision, and illusory motion of the self, the visual scene, or both. Many of the same types of disturbances encountered in space flight reappear immediately after crew members return to earth. The magnitude of these neurosensory, sensory-motor and perceptual disturbances, and the time needed to recover from them, tend to vary as a function of mission duration and the space travelers prior experience with the stimulus rearrangement of space flight. To adequately chart the development of neurosensory changes associated with space flight, we recommend development of enhanced eye movement systems and body position measurement. We also advocate the use of a human small radius centrifuge as both a research tool and as a means of providing on-orbit countermeasures that will lessen the impact of living for long periods of time with out exposure to altering gravito-inertial forces.",Excluded

The test subjects were positioned so that the changing resultant gravito-inertial field in the aircraft was aligned with their interaural (y) axis, primarily stimulating the utricular organs. The analysis of the torsional component of eye movement during the change of gravity between 1.8-0 and 0-1.8 g demonstrated a static component--well known as the ocular counter roll--and a dynamic component, which leads to a slight overshoot in the torsional response. These static and dynamic component of ocular torsion correlate with previous neurophysiological findings.",Excluded

Other populations with similar reduced responses have shown improved immunogenicity to a high-dose vaccine. OBJECTIVE(S): A pilot prospective cohort study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Fluzone High-Dose influenza vaccine in patients with CNS malignancy. METHOD(S): Baseline data on diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiation, glucocorticoids, and timing of treatment were collected. All patients underwent vaccination with of the Fluzone High-Dose influenza vaccine. Serum samples are actively being collected at baseline, day 28, and 3 months following vaccine administration. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers will be measured to determine seroconversion (4-fold rise) and seroprotection (titer 1:40). RESULT(S): A total of 27 patients were enrolled. Mean age at baseline was 52.7 years (+/-12.6);41% male; 93% white and 7% black. Diagnoses included high-grade glioma (85%), CNS lymphoma (11%), and meningioma (4%). At enrollment, 8 patients (30%) were taking glucocorticoids, 4 (15%) were undergoing active radiation, 14 (52%) were on chemotherapy, and 5 (19%) began chemotherapy following vaccine administration. Prior radiation (n = 19, 70%) and chemotherapy (n = 14, 52%) were common. Seven patients (26%) reported post-vaccination symptoms potentially attributable to vaccination; 6 experienced only local soreness or redness at the injection site and 1 suffered headache, nausea, vomiting. All symptoms were transient and resolved completely. At baseline, 8 patients (30%) had absolute CD4 < 300. Serum samples for HAI assay are being collected. Seroconversion and seroprotection rates are forthcoming. CONCLUSION(S): Studies have shown that populations known to respond poorly to standard yearly influenza vaccination (e.g. the elderly) can mount an effective immunologic response to the high-dose vaccine. This prospective cohort study will provide preliminary data regarding the immunologic response to high-dose vaccination in patients with primary CNS malignancy.

1800,"Glutamate transporters regulate extrasynaptic NMDA receptor modulation of Kv2.1 potassium channels Delayed-rectifier Kv2.1 potassium channels regulate somatodendritic excitability during periods of repetitive, high-frequency activity. Recent evidence suggests that Kv2.1 channel modulation is linked to glutamatergic neurotransmission. Because NMDA-type glutamate receptors are critical regulators of synaptic plasticity, we investigated NMDA receptor modulation of Kv2.1 channels in rodent hippocampus and cortex. Bath application of NMDA potently unclustered and dephosphorylated Kv2.1 and produced a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependent activation of voltage-sensitive potassium currents (I(K)). In contrast, driving synaptic activity in Mg2+-free media to hyperactivate synaptic NMDA receptors had no effect on Kv2.1 channels, and moderate pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure activity in adult mice did not dephosphorylate hippocampal Kv2.1 channels. Selective activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors unclustered and dephosphorylated Kv2.1 channels and produced a hyperpolarizing shift in neuronal I(K). In addition, inhibition of glutamate uptake rapidly activated NMDA receptors and dephosphorylated Kv2.1 channels. These observations demonstrate that regulation of intrinsic neuronal activity by Kv2.1 is coupled to extrasynaptic but not synaptic NMDA receptors. These data support a novel mechanism for glutamate transporters in regulation of neuronal excitability and plasticity through extrasynaptic NMDA receptor modulation of Kv2.1 channels.",Excluded
312,"Synapses in the fly motion-vision pathway: evidence for a broad range of signal amplitudes and dynamics Synapses are generally considered to operate efficiently only when their signaling range matches the spectrum of prevailing presynaptic signals in terms of both amplitudes and dynamics. However, the prerequisites for optimally matching the signaling ranges may differ between spike-mediated and graded synaptic transmission. This poses a problem for synapses that convey both graded and spike signals at the same time. We addressed this issue by tracing transmission systematically in vivo in the blowfly's visual-motion pathway by recording from single neurons that receive mixed potential signals consisting of rather slow graded fluctuations superimposed with highly variable spikes from a small number of presynaptic elements. Both pre- and postsynaptic neurons were previously shown to represent preferred-direction motion velocity reliably and linearly at low fluctuation frequencies. To selectively assess the performance of individual synapses and to precisely control presynaptic signals, we voltage clamped one of the presynaptic neurons. Results showed that synapses can effectively convey signals over a much larger amplitude and frequency range than is normally used during graded transmission of visual signals. An explanation for this unexpected finding might lie in the transmission of the spike component that reaches larger amplitudes and contains higher frequencies than graded signals.",Excluded

600,"What is the role of combined chemoradiotherapy for grade III glioma in adults? Classification, prognosis and treatment of grade III glioma is now determined predominantly by molecular biomarkers, with 1p19q chromosomal co-deletion conferring a clear prognostic benefit and also being associated with better response to chemotherapy. The importance of this molecular biomarker is reflected in the updated WHO classification of central nervous system tumours that was published in 2016. Long term data from two large, randomised trials have shown that patients with 1p19q co-deleted anaplastic oligodendrogliomas derive significant survival benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy. More recent data from the NOA-04 study indicate that primary chemotherapy is not superior to primary radiotherapy in any molecular subgroup of anaplastic glioma and hence do not support the concept of 'delayed radiotherapy' in these patients. Despite the documented association of chemosensitivity with 1p19q co-deletion, a recent planned interim analysis of the CATNON study revealed that patients with anaplastic astrocytomas with inatct 1p19q chromosomal regions also derive significant benefit from the addition of adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy. It is not yet known whether the use of temozolomide concomitant with radiotherapy confers additional benefit; these hotly anticipated data are not expected to be available for at least two years. Hence, all patients with grade III gliomas appear to benefit from both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with maximum survival benefit being achieved by 'early' rather than 'delayed' treatment. A number of questions remain, including the optimum scheduling of these treatments and the optimum radiotherapy regime for the different molecular subtypes. The question of radiation dose and volume is particularly important for this group of patients in whom long term survival can be anticipated and the risks and potential impact of neurotoxicity are significant. Strategies to reduce the long term neurocognitive impact of radiotherapy in these patients should be developed and incorporated into future clinical trials.",Excluded

The total absorbed radiation doses were equal to or less than 57 cGy. Observed changes in the FTIR spectra represent the damage in the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of nucleic acid, which seem to be connected with modification of bases and sugars, and redistribution of the H-bond network. FTIR data for tumour and gamma-irradiated nucleic acid show some similar features. A great amount of statistical data and good mathematical approaches are needed for the use of these data as diagnostic criteria.",Included

2170,"[Effect of the psychostimulants caffeine and methylphenidate on the efficiency of physical activity in rats exposed to ionizing radiation] The authors carried out studies on 267 male rats and examined the effect of ionizing irradation (single irradation with 737 roentgens) on the duration of swimming and on the alteration of this effect by psychic stimulators caffeine and methylphenidate, administered in overthreshold doses (30 and 50 mg/kg of body weight for caffeine and 5 and 10 mg/kg of body weight for methylphenidate). On the 7th day after irradiation there was statistically significant shortening of the duration of swimming in the control animals. The mentioned doses (statistically significant for the larger dose) were used in nonirradiated animals and the two psychic stimulators also shortened the duration of swimming in comparison with the control nonirradiated animals. This effect could be explained by hyperexcitatory action of these doses of caffeine and methylphenidate. As a result of this, desoptimization of the cerebral activity occurred and as a consequence of which was the diminution of the efficiency of the physical activity. Together with this they observed that both psychic stimulators partially counteracted the shortening of the duration of swimming of rats, caused by ionizing irradiation itself. This effect, especially for caffeine, could be explained by the induced of the ionizing irradiation increase in the sensitivity of cerebral phosphodiesterase of rats to its inhibitor caffeine as a result of which under these conditions the effect of caffeine on the level of cerebral cyclic AMP was reinforced. The cyclic AMP is presumed to have some protective effect against ionizing irradiation.",Included

Conversely, these rays were found to have no significant effect on the hepatic prostaglandin F2alpha and to induce, depending on the radiation dose, a reversible or an irreversible decrease in the content of cerebral prostaglandin F2alpha. These results are believed to provide some evidence for a schematic formulation of a mechanism of the radiation induced latent circulatory insufficiency and to elucidate some aspects of the functional interrelations between these prostaglandins, catecholamines, acetylcholine and cyclic AMP after gamma irradiation.",Included

3100,"Specificity in the response of the mammalian methylome to ionizing radiation Environmental epigenetics is the study of how exposures interact with the epigenome to cause stable epigenetic change, most notably changes in DNA methylation patterns. Here we asked whether the response of the mouse epigenome to ionizing radiation is specific or non-specific. We used meDIP-seq to examine radiation-induced changes in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) throughout the genome. To examine tissue specificity, we compared the methylomes of heart and brain tissue 22 weeks after exposure to protons. We found 5mC and 5hmC changes that mapped to genes with cardiovascular functions in the heart and with neuronal functions in the brain. We also compared two forms of ionizing radiation, the sparsely ionizing protons and densely ionizing 56Fe ions. Both are components of galactic cosmic radiation, which is a concern for astronauts flying deep space missions. Specifically, we asked whether protons and 56Fe ions would produce similar DNA methylation changes in the brain at 4 weeks post exposure, and found significant overlap for both 5mC and 5hmC changes. Interestingly, gene expression changes in the brain at 4 weeks were linked to changes in 5hmC at promoter regions, but not 5mC, and these linked changes mapped to neuronal ontology pathways. Further, a novel form of 5hmC change along gene bodies was observed and mapped mostly to postsynaptic pathways. Finally, the extent of 56Fe ion-induced behavioral change correlated inversely with DNA methylation change suggesting that the epigenomic response to radiation was part of the repair process to mitigate its toxic effects.",Included

All patients had treatment and follow-up data available in their medical charts, which we extracted for this retrospective study. We evaluated a number of potential predictors of survival after WBRT: age, primary tumor stage, control of primary tumor, presence of other systemic metastases, site of systemic metastases, Karnofsky performance status, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recursive partitioning analysis class, total dose of WBRT, and number of BM. Eighteen patients received a total dose >3000 cGy and 7 received a partial brain boost.RESULTS: For the entire cohort, the median survival from the start of WBRT was 4.2 months. The 1-year survival rate was 17%, and the 2-year survival rate was 2%. Using univariate analysis, only Karnofsky performance status (p = 0. 0084), recursive partitioning analysis class (p = 0. 0147), and total WBRT dose (p = 0.0001) were predictive of longer survival. In multivariate analysis, Karnofsky performance status was the only significant predictor.CONCLUSION: Overall survival in breast cancer patients with BM treated with WBRT is poor.

1311,"Brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis predicts response in cancer patients with brain metastases Lymphocytopenia is one of the main toxicities of radiotherapy and its severity is related to the irradiation dose. The occurrence of lymphocytopenia depends on the body site of radiotherapy; it is most pronounced with pelvic irradiation, whereas the effect of brain irradiation on the lymphocyte count is to be elucidated. This preliminary study was performed to evaluate changes in lymphocyte number occurring during brain irradiation in cancer patients with brain metastases. The study included 50 patients who received brain radiotherapy for single or multiple brain metastases at a total dose of 30 Gy. Overall, no significant changes in mean lymphocyte number occurred during brain radiotherapy. However, when lymphocyte variations were assessed in relation to the clinical response of brain metastases, a significant increase in the mean number of lymphocytes was found in patients who achieved objective regression of brain metastases on brain irradiation. The mean lymphocyte number decreased in nonresponding patients, albeit without a statistically significant difference with respect to the pretreatment values. The results of this study show that the efficacy of radiotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is associated with a significant increase in mean lymphocyte number. Therefore, evidence of brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis may predict the efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded

1764,"InterCardioRisk: a novel online tool for estimating doses of ionising radiation to occupationally-exposed medical staff and their associated health risks Those working in interventional cardiology and related medical procedures are potentially subject to considerable exposure to x-rays. Two types of tissue of particular concern that may receive considerable doses during such procedures are the lens of the eye and the brain. Ocular radiation exposure results in lens changes that, with time, may progress to partial or total lens opacification (cataracts). In the early stages, such opacities do not result in visual disability; the severity of such changes tends to increase progressively with dose and time until vision is impaired and cataract surgery is required. Scattered radiation doses to the eye lens of an interventional cardiologist in typical working conditions can exceed 34 muGy min<sup>-1</sup> in high-dose fluoroscopy modes and 3 muGy per image during image acquisition (instantaneous rate values) when radiation protection tools are not used. A causal relation between exposure to ionising radiation and increased risk of brain and central nervous system tumours has been shown in a number of studies. Although absorbed doses to the brain in interventional cardiology procedures are lower than those to the eye lens by a factor between 3.40 and 8.08 according to our simulations, doses to both tissues are among the highest occupational radiation doses documented for medical staff whose work involves exposures to x-rays.

3576,"A predictive model for distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumour progression after gamma knife radiosurgery based on radiomic features from MR images OBJECTIVES: To develop a model using radiomic features extracted from MR images to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumour progression in brain metastases after Gamma Knife radiosurgery.METHODS: We retrospectively identified 87 patients with pathologically confirmed necrosis (24 lesions) or progression (73 lesions) and calculated 285 radiomic features from four MR sequences (T1, T1 post-contrast, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) obtained at two follow-up time points per lesion per patient. Reproducibility of each feature between the two time points was calculated within each group to identify a subset of features with distinct reproducible values between two groups. Changes in radiomic features from one time point to the next (delta radiomics) were used to build a model to classify necrosis and progression lesions.RESULTS: A combination of five radiomic features from both T1 post-contrast and T2 MR images were found to be useful in distinguishing necrosis from progression lesions. Delta radiomic features with a RUSBoost ensemble classifier had an overall predictive accuracy of 73.2% and an area under the curve value of 0.73 in leave-one-out cross-validation.CONCLUSIONS: Delta radiomic features extracted from MR images have potential for distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumour progression after radiosurgery for brain metastases.KEY POINTS: * Some radiomic features showed better reproducibility for progressive lesions than necrotic ones * Delta radiomic features can help to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumour progression * Delta radiomic features had better predictive value than did traditional radiomic features.",Excluded

We analyzed 135 patients with BM of NSCLC who were administered Cyberknife radiosurgery (CKRS) as either initial or salvage therapy. We evaluated local failure (LF), intracranial failure (IF), and neurological death (ND) due to BM. Primary outcome was neurological death-free survival (NDFS). Median follow-up was 16.2 months. Median CKRS dose of 22 Gy was administered to median 2 targets per patient. Among 99 deaths, 14 (14%) were ND. Upfront treatment for BM included CKRS alone in 85 patients (63%), CKRS + TA in 26 patients (19%), and WBRT in 24 patients (18%). No patients or tumor related factors were associated with ND. However, the type of upfront treatment for BM was significantly associated with ND [HR 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.57) for CKRS + TA, HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.19-1.68) for CKRS alone] compared with the WBRT group (P = 0.01).

We have examined disc shedding in eye cups kept in a complex tissue culture medium. Eye cups were prepared in red light from dark-adapted animals or in white light from constant light-treated animals. Light-evoked shedding did not occur in the standard medium with -20 mM sodium bicarbonate, but a large light-evoked response was consistently seen when medium bicarbonate was raised to 030 mM. In high-bicarbonate medium, light-evoked shedding was comparable in magnitude, size distribution of phagosomes, and time course to similar responses observed in intact animals. Preliminary analysis of culture conditions which support shedding suggests that bicarbonate ion concentration is of critical importance. However, lack of light-evoked shedding in a high-bicarbonate Ringer solution suggests that some additional unidentified factor(s) in the complex medium is also necessary. The data indicate that both light- and dark-dependent processes involved in the control of photoperiod-related shedding are sustained in appropriate culture medium.",Excluded

The median follow up time was 2.8 and 2.0 years (range 1 month to 10 years) for anterior and posterior segment complications, respectively.RESULTS: The 3 and 5 year probabilities of being without radiation cataract were 73% and 63%, without neovascular glaucoma 91% and 81%, without vitreous haemorrhage 83% and 74%, without radiation maculopathy 85% and 70%, and without radiation optic neuropathy 90% and 88%, respectively. The risk of radiation cataract was highest with large tumour size (T1 + T2 v T3, p = 0.0027; height < or = 5 v > 5 mm, p = 0.029; largest basal diameter (LBD) < or = 15 v > 15 mm, p < 0.0001) and location of anterior tumour margin anterior v posterior to the equator (p = 0.0003); the risk of neovascular glaucoma with large size (T1 + T2 v T3, p = 0.039; LBD < or = 15 mm v 15 mm, p = 0.021); and the risk of maculopathy and optic neuropathy with proximity of the posterior tumour margin to the fovea and the optic disc (< or = 1.5 v > 1.5 mm; p = 0.030 and p = 0.0004, respectively). In Cox's multivariate analysis the strongest risk indicator for radiation cataract (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.6) and vitreous haemorrhage (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8) was the height of the tumour; for neovascular glaucoma the TNM class (RR 6.2, 95% CI 2.7-13.8); for radiation maculopathy location of posterior tumour margin within 2 mm from the fovea (RR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-6.0); and for radiation optic neuropathy location of tumour margin within 1 DD of the optic disc (RR 6.1, 95% CI 3.0-12.4).

Nonsyndromic glioma families have been studied but no genes have been identified in the two published linkage studies of familial glioma probably due to the small number of families. Because glioma is a rare but devastating cancer, and a family history of glioma has been observed in ~5% of the cases, we initiated an international consortium to identify glioma families not affected by syndromes to better understand the inherited factors related to this disease.

To test the availability of the arrestin-1 pool in dark-adapted outer segment (OS) for rhodopsin shutoff, we measured photoresponse recovery rates of mice with arrestin-1 content in the OS of 2.5%, 5%, 60%, and 100% of wild type (WT) level by two-flash ERG with the first (desensitizing) flash at 160, 400, 1000, and 2500 photons/rod. The time of half recovery (t(half)) in WT retinas increases with the intensity of the initial flash, becoming ~2.5-fold longer upon activation of 2500 than after 160 rhodopsins/rod. Mice with 60% and even 5% of WT arrestin-1 level recovered at WT rates. In contrast, the mice with 2.5% of WT arrestin-1 had a dramatically slower recovery than the other three lines, with the t(half) increasing ~28 fold between 160 and 2500 rhodopsins/rod. Even after the dimmest flash, the rate of recovery of rods with 2.5% of normal arrestin-1 was two times slower than in other lines, indicating that arrestin-1 level in the OS between 100% and 5% of WT is sufficient for rapid recovery, whereas with lower arrestin-1 the rate of recovery dramatically decreases with increased light intensity. Thus, the OS has two distinct pools of arrestin-1: cytoplasmic and a separate pool comprising ~2.5% that is not immediately available for rhodopsin quenching. The observed delay suggests that this pool is localized at the periphery, so that its diffusion across the OS rate-limits the recovery. The line with very low arrestin-1 expression is the first where rhodopsin inactivation was made rate-limiting by arrestin manipulation.",Excluded

We previously have reported that hyperosmotic mannitol-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB-D), followed by intracarotid (i.c.) administration of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, significantly enhanced tumor boron delivery and the efficacy of BNCT in F98 glioma bearing rats. The purpose of the present study was to determine the short-term neuropathologic consequences of this treatment and the long-term effects on motor and cognitive function, as well as the neuropathologic sequelae 1 year following neutron capture irradiation. BBB-D was carried out in non-tumor bearing Fischer rats by infusing a 25% solution of mannitol i.c. followed by i.c. injection of BPA or BSH, either individually or in combination, immediately thereafter. Animals were euthanized 2 days after compound administration, and their brains were processed for neuropathologic examination, which revealed sporadic, mild, focal neuronal degeneration, hemorrhage, and necrosis. To assess the long-term effects of such treatment followed by neutron capture irradiation, non-tumor bearing rats were subjected to BBB-D after which they were injected i.c. with BPA (25 mg B/kg body weight (b.w)) or BSH (30 mg B/kg b.w.) either individually or in combination (BPA 12.5 mg and BSH 14 mg B/kg b.w.). Two and a half hours later they were irradiated at the Medical Research Reactor, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, with the same physical radiation doses (5.79, 8.10 or 10.06 Gy), delivered to the brain, as those that previously had been used for our therapy experiments. The animals tolerated this procedure well, after which they were returned to Columbus, Ohio where their clinical status was monitored weekly. After 1 year, motor function was assessed using a sensitive and reliable locomotor rating scale for open field testing in rats and cognitive function was evaluated by their performance in the Morris water maze, the results of which were similar to those obtained with age matched controls. After functional evaluation, the rats were euthanized, their brains were removed, and then processed for neuropathologic examination. Subtle histopathologic changes were seen in the choroid plexuses of irradiated animals that had received BPA, BSH or saline. Radiation related ocular changes consisting of keratitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis and cataract formation were seen with similar frequency in most rats in each treatment group. Based on these observations, and the previously reported significant therapeutic gain associated with BBB-D and i.c. injection of BSH and BPA, the present observations establish its safety in rats and suggest that further studies in large animals and humans are warranted.",Included

One hundred thirty-four Caucasian men and 105 African-American men were assigned randomly to one of two approaches to delivering the intervention or to the control condition. Men entered the study immediately after surgical treatment or in the first 3 weeks of radiation therapy. Trained nurses delivered the intervention through weekly phone calls for 8 weeks.RESULTS: The authors found that the majority of intervention effects were from baseline to 4 months postbaseline, when treatment side effects are most intense. Both Caucasian men and African-American men who received either one of the two approaches for delivering the intervention improved in the two uncertainty management methods of cognitive reframing and problem solving. Similarly, when the intervention groups were combined, men who received the intervention also improved significantly in control of incontinence by 4 months postbaseline. Decreases in the number of treatment side effects differed by time and treatment/ ethnic group interactions as did satisfaction with sexual functioning.CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first tests of a psychoeducational intervention among men with prostate carcinoma and was the first test that included a sufficient number of African-American men to test by ethnic group.

The leading hypothesis explaining spaceflight-induced vision impairment is that a cephalad fluid shift leads to altered tissue volume and pressure relationships in the eye and orbit. We hypothesize that reducing venous outflow from the dependent limbs with a venoconstrictive thigh cuff will temporarily reverse or attenuate ocular and cerebral volume changes observed during 15degree head-down tilt (HDT). Method(s): Twenty normal subjects (12M, 8F) were studied following a 10 min stabilization period, seated, supine, HDT, and HDT with commercially-available thigh cuffs (CUFF) inflated to 60 mm Hg. We quantified Bruch's membrane to lamina cribrosa (LC) depth in 13 subjects and peripapillary choroidal thickness (PPC) in 19 subjects from enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography images. Average PPC was quantified from 1.5 to 3 mm from the center of the ONH along radial B-scans at clock hours 12, 3, 6, and 9. The optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and internal jugular vein cross-sectional area (IJVA) were measured using ultrasound. Mixed-effects linear regression model with repeated measures was used to test for significant PPC, LC, IJVA, and ONSD changes. All data are presented as mean +/- standard error. Result(s): Compared to seated (377+/-28 mum) or with CUFF (363+/-28 mum), LC depth significantly (P<0.01) increased in the supine (395+/-28 mum) and HDT (384+/-28 mum) positions. PPC at clock hour 9 significantly (P<0.01) increased from seated (198+/-16 mum) to HDT (208+/-16 mum), however CUFF was not significantly different from HDT. In addition, PPC at clock hours 12 and 6 were significantly different between the seated and HDT conditions. IJVA and ONSD increased from the seated (IJVA: 0.15+/-0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> and ONSD: 0.533+/-0.012 cm) to HDT (IJVA: 1.03+/-0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> and ONSD: 0.581 +/-0.012 cm) posture (P<0.001) but were not affected by CUFF. Conclusion(s): Moving from the seated to HDT posture alters LC depth and PPC. These results suggest that HDT, a microgravity analog results in an acute cephalad fluid shift that significantly alters posterior optic nerve head structure. Application of bilateral thigh cuffs inflated to 60 mm Hg for 10 minutes was not sufficient to reverse all these changes to levels measured during the seated posture.",Excluded

All patients received radiotherapy (8 patients were given conventional radiotherapy 60Gy/30 fractions at 2Gy per fraction over a period of 6 weeks while 43 patients treated with hypofractionated regimen 48Gy/16 fractions at 3Gy per fraction over a period of 3 weeks. Result(s): Median age at diagnosis was 47 Years (Range 18-73) and Male to female ratio was 3:1. ECOG performance status 0, I, II was 24%, 16% and 11% respectively. Radiological response was 64% (Partial response 34% and stable disease in 30%) and 36% had progressive disease on MRI which was done 3 months following completion of radiotherapy. On Univariate analysis ECOG performance status, extent of surgical resection and response following radiotherapy were significant prognostic factors (P=0.003, P=0.01 and 0.002 respectively). Median over all survival for all patients was 8 months. Conclusion(s): The outcome of GBM remains poor despite adequate surgical resection and good radiotherapy techniques. Extent of surgery and the performance status were the most important prognostic factors. Improved outcome with the use of temozolamide is a step forward in this regard.",Excluded
2556,"Pseudoprogression following chemoradiotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme PURPOSE: Pseudoprogression (psPD) is now recognised following radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide (RT/TMZ) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of psPD following RT/TMZ and the effect of psPD on prognosis.MATERIALS/METHODS: All patients receiving RT/TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM were identified from a prospective database. Clinical and radiographic data were retrospectively reviewed. Early progression was defined as radiological progression (RECIST criteria) during or within eight weeks of completing RT/TMZ. Pseudoprogression was defined as early progression with subsequent disease stabilization, without salvage therapy, for at least six months from completion of RT/TMZ. The primary outcome was overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) and log rank analysis was used to compare groups.RESULTS: Out of 111 patients analyzed, 104 were evaluable for radiological response. Median age was 58 years and median follow-up 55 weeks. Early progression was confirmed in 26% and within this group 32% had psPD. Median survival for the whole cohort was 56.7 weeks [95% CI (51.0, 71.3)]. Median survival for patients with psPD was significantly higher than for patients with true early progression (124.9 weeks versus 36.0 weeks, p = 0.0286).CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of patients with early progression were found to have psPD which was associated with a favourable prognosis. Maintenance TMZ should not be abandoned on the basis of seemingly discouraging imaging features identified within the first three months after RT/TMZ.",Excluded
747,"Does the robotic platform reduce the morbidity associated with combined radical surgery and adjuvant radiation for early cervical cancer? Objectives: Open radical hysterectomy (RH) followed by adjuvant radiation (XRT) for cervical cancer has been associated with high morbidity; however, RHs are now often performed robotically. We examined if the robotic platform decreases the morbidity associated with radical surgery followed by adjuvant XRT. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of patients with cervical cancer undergoing RH from 1995-2013 was performed. Clinical and pathologic data were obtained from the medical record. Long-term (LT) complications were defined as urinary and/or bowel complications, and lymphedema presenting more than 30 days after completion of therapy. Complications were graded. Grade 1 was mild symptoms and easily treated. Grade 2 was symptoms resolving with long-term medical therapy. Grade 3 was major symptoms requiring surgery or invasive procedures. The X<sup>2</sup> and student t tests were used for analysis. Result(s): Overall, 243 patients underwent RH for cervical cancer. The open surgical approach was used in 43% (n = 104) and the robotic approach was used in 57% (n = 139). Eighty-three patients (34.2%) required adjuvant XRT. XRT was associated with increased risk of LT complication (28.9% vs 7.0% P <.001). LT complications included lymphedema (n = 18), bowel-associated complications (enteritis/proctitis n = 8, obstruction n = 2), and urinary complications (hemorrhagic cystitis n = 1, neurogenic bladder n = 2, fistula n = 1, and ureteral stricture n = 3). Among patients who received adjuvant XRT, the open surgical approach was used in 48% (n = 40) and the robotic approach in 52% (n = 43). There was no difference in time to initiation of XRT between the 2 surgical groups (43.2 +/- 15.6 vs 47.3 +/- 19.6 days, P =.33). There was no difference in grade 2/3 LT complications in patients receiving adjuvant XRT between the groups (27.5% vs 27.9%, P =.97). However, patients undergoing open surgery experienced a trend toward increased adhesion-related complications, such as bowel obstruction and ureteral stricture (10% vs 2.3%, P =.19). Conclusion(s): We found no difference in LT complications between patients who underwent robotic and those who underwent open RH and adjuvant XRT. Fewer adhesion-related LT complications may be seen with robotic surgery. However, because many XRT-related complications occur at later time points, continued follow-up is needed to evaluate for potential differences between the 2 groups.",Included

Recently, these proteins have been described to be expressed in neuroectodermal tumors and to function as cancer-retina antigens.

Similar modulation can be detected at the protein level in melanoma cells except for no changes in PDE6 protein levels. Two regulatory pathways have been identified: Sp1/Sp3/Sp4 proteins for rhodopsin and PDE6, and mitogen-activated protein kinases for recoverin and arrestin. The visual cascade and retinoic acid as its derivate do not play any role in this process. Putative explanations for light-dependent modulation of cancer-retina antigen expression in melanoma cells are discussed.",Excluded

Microbiocenosis of the intestine was investigated in 99 practically healthy persons under model earth conditions and in 34 cosmonauts after space flights of various duration. The following factors influencing intestinal microflora in man under extreme conditions were studied: neuroemotional tension, hypokinesia, increased physical loads, isolation under conditions of altered gaseous environment and microclimate. The study revealed that the above factors participated in development of dysbacteriosis. It was shown that the neuroemotional stress played the main role in development of dysbacteriosis in man under extreme conditions: intestinal microflora responded under extreme conditions by decreased counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli participating in maintenance of the intact ecological barrier and colonization resistance. For preventing dysbacteriotic reactions of intestinal microflora it was recommended to use bifidobacterin tablets.

The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation exposure of patients treated with Onyx to the radation exposure of those treated with nBCA on a per embolization basis. Method(s): The study group consisted of 34 patients that were embolized at the Leiden University Medical Center. Patients were assigned to two groups, Group I consisting of patients that had received Onyx embolization and Group II consisting of patients that had received nBCA embolization. The patient groups were matched for age, AVM characteristics and the number of embolizations. Cohorts were compared by PA radiation dose and lateral radiation dose. Result(s): A total of 44 embolizations were performed on 34 patients (Onyx, 17 patients and 22 embolizations; nBCA, 17 patients and 22 embolizations). There were no significant differences in AVM characteristics and patient demographics. Mean PA radiation doses were increased for Onyx (285,5041 Gy.cm<sup>2</sup>) compared to nBCA (162,6286 Gy.cm<sup>2</sup>) embolizations (P < 0,01).

1449,"Targeting PARP-1 with alpha-particles is potently cytotoxic to human neuroblastoma in preclinical models Alpha-emitters can be pharmacologically delivered for irradiation of single cancer cells, but cellular lethality could be further enhanced by targeting alpha-emitters directly to the nucleus. PARP-1 is a druggable protein in the nucleus that is overexpressed in neuroblastoma compared with normal tissues and is associated with decreased survival in high-risk patients. To exploit this, we have functionalized a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) with an alpha-emitter astatine-211. This approach offers enhanced cytotoxicity from conventional PARPis by not requiring enzymatic inhibition of PARP-1 to elicit DNA damage; instead, the alpha-particle directly induces multiple double-strand DNA breaks across the particle track. Here, we explored the efficacy of [<sup>211</sup>At]MM4 in multiple cancers and found neuroblastoma to be highly sensitive in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, alpha-particles delivered to neuroblastoma show antitumor effects and durable responses in a neuroblastoma xenograft model, especially when administered in a fractionated regimen.

In order to define minimum dose requirements and the rotation correction capacity, a low dose BS MSCTA protocol was defined and evaluated in 12 patients in comparison to a common manual bone removal algorithm. Standard MIPs of both modalities were evaluated in a blinded manner by two neuroradiologists for image quality composed, of vessel contour sharpness and bony vessel superposition, by using a five-point score each. Effective Dose (E) and data post-processing times were defined.RESULTS: In experimental studies prescan tube current could be cut down to one-sixth of post-contrast scan doses without compromise of bone-subtraction whereas incomplete subtraction appeared from four degrees head malrotation on. Prescan E amounted to additional 1.1mSv (+25%) in clinical studies. BS MSCTA performed significantly superior in terms of bony superposition for vascular segments C3-C7 (p<0.001), V1-V2, V3-V4 (p<0.05, p<0.001 respectively) and the ophthalmic artery (p<0.05), whereas vessel contour sharpness in BS MSCTA only proved superior for arterial segments V3-V4 (p<0.001) and C3-C7 (p<0.001). MBR MSCTA received higher ratings in vessel contour sharpness for C1-C2 (p<0.001), callosomarginal artery (p<0.001), M1, M2, M3 (p<0.001 each) and the basilar artery (p<0.001). Reconstruction times amounted to an average of 1.5 (BS MSCTA) and 3min (MBR MSCTA) respectively.CONCLUSION: The novel BS algorithm provides superior skull base artery visualisation as compared to common manual bone removal algorithms, increasing the Effective Dose by one-fourth. Yet, inferior vessel contour sharpness was noted intracranially, thus limiting the BS algorithm use to patients with suspected vessel pathology at the skull base level.",Excluded
1968,"Heterosynaptic co-activation of glutamatergic and dopaminergic afferents is required to induce persistent long-term potentiation The persistence of protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (late-LTP) is thought to require heterosynaptic activation of both glutamate and neuromodulatory receptors in the hippocampus. The present series of experiments contrasts two alternative accounts of heterosynaptic activation. The original version of the synaptic-tag hypothesis of the variable persistence of LTP implied that neuromodulatory and glutamatergic activation could occur independently, albeit within a critical time-window; an alternative view is that there needs to be simultaneous co-activation of both receptors to trigger the up-regulation of relevant protein synthesis (Neuron 34 (2002) 235). Our findings include a replication, over 6 h post-LTP-induction, of earlier findings showing heterosynaptic influences on LTP persistence. Specifically, 'strong' tetanisation with multiple trains of stimulation of one input pathway in a conventional hippocampal slice preparation induces a D1/D5 receptor-dependent form of late-LTP that enables 'weak' tetanic stimulation to induce late-LTP on an independent pathway. However, we also observed that when the first pathway was tetanised in the presence of AP5, not only was no LTP observed on that pathway, but there was also no rescue of late-LTP on the second pathway. Thus, it appears that DA receptors must be co-activated with NMDA receptors in a common pool of neurons to enable LTP persistence, although late-LTP can still be induced by selective activation of glutamatergic synapses if this occurs at time periods shortly before or shortly after this essential coactivation.",Excluded

However, the toxicity of MRT in central nervous system (CNS) use is still unknown. To gather baseline toxicological data, we evaluated mortality in normal mice following CNS-targeted MRT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Synchrotron X-ray-beam radiation was provided by the SPring-8 BL28B2 beam-line. For MRT, radiation was delivered to groups of mice in a 10 x 12 mm unidirectional array consisting of 25-mum-wide beams spaced 100, 200 or 300 mum apart; another group of mice received the equivalent broad-beam radiation therapy (BRT) for comparison. Peak and valley dose rates of the MRT were 120 and 0.7 Gy/s, respectively. Delivered doses were 96-960 Gy for MRT, and 24-120 Gy for BRT. Mortality was monitored for 90 days post-irradiation. Brain tissue was stained using hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate neural structure. Demyelination was evaluated by Kluver-Barrera staining. The LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>100</sub> when using MRT were 600 Gy and 720 Gy, respectively, and when using BRT they were 80 Gy and 96 Gy, respectively. In MRT, mortality decreased as the center-to-center beam spacing increased from 100 mum to 300 mum. Cortical architecture was well preserved in MRT, whereas BRT induced various degrees of cerebral hemorrhage and demyelination. MRT was able to deliver extremely high doses of radiation, while still minimizing neuronal death. The valley doses, influenced by beam spacing and irradiated dose, could represent important survival factors for MRT.",Included

Results in the new subjects supported the asymmetry hypothesis and confirmed previous findings that those with low scores of torsional disconjugacy on the KC-135 did not suffer space motion sickness in their prior Shuttle missions while those with high scores did. Tilting subjects with high disconjugacy scores slightly to one side and the other failed to find a position that decreased disconjugacy in hypergravity, leading to the conclusion that a simple planar asymmetry about the y-axis was probably not the cause of the observed torsional differences in the two eyes.

2112,"Defining survival for patients with breast cancer with brain metastases Background: Brain metastases account for 100,000 to 170,000 cases per year in the U.S, the bulk being from breast and lung primaries. About 10-15% of breast cancer patients develop brain metastases and historically, their survival has been poor. Introduction of novel chemotherapeutic and biologic agents and newer radiation techniques in the past decade has led to better control of systemic disease raising the possibility of increasing incidence of brain metastases as well as better control of CNS disease. The aim of this study was to determine the survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases in our practice in the last 10 years. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart analysis and we analyzed the charts of 18 patients with breast cancer who had developed brain metastases. The parameters analyzed included patient age at diagnosis of breast cancer and at development of brain metastases, receptor status and various treatment modalities used to control local as well as Metastatic disease. Result(s): The median survival time after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and the number of brain metastases was 55 months. The time to death was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model, adjusting for age and number of brain metastases. Age at diagnosis of breast cancer was significant with a p-value of 0.007 and the number of brain metastases was not significant with a p-value of 0.55. Using the Log Rank test, median survival for Her2neu positive patients was 71 months and for Her2neu negative patients was 58 months with a non-significant p value of 0.86.

The midline of the neck and skull was always inside the radiation field. The animals were sacrificed either 6 months or 12 months after completion of the randomly assigned irradiation protocol. Five non-irradiated rats served as controls.RESULTS: No TM developed in the non-irradiated animals. Out of 60 irradiated rats 9 developed a pituitary TM (15%). In remnants of the normal adenohypophysis we revealed immunohistochemical reactivity for growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In the radiation-induced adenomas, 4 TM were immuno-reactive for TSH, 4 for GH, 2 for PRL, and 2 for FSH. The TM did not react with anti-ACTH and anti-LH (luteinizing hormone) anti-sera.CONCLUSIONS: Obviously, irradiation accelerates the development of pituitary gland adenomas. In this series the TM were predominantly incidental findings at necropsies after pretermed follow-up intervals with a variety of hormone-producing cells. On the other hand, four of nine TM were null adenomas. Necropsies of the brain should be carried out routinely in irradiation studies of the skull.",Included

Preoperative differences between PDD and PD included older age (69.2 +/- 5.8 years; 62.6 +/- 8 years), presence of hallucinations and poorer executive score (10.1 +/- 5.9; 5.5 +/- 4.4). The incidence of dementia over 3 years after STN-DBS is similar to the one reported in medically treated patients. The PDD presented preoperative risk factors of developing dementia similar to those described in medically treated patients.

2445,"Disuse Osteoporosis: Clinical and Mechanistic Insights Disuse osteoporosis describes a state of bone loss due to local skeletal unloading or systemic immobilization. This review will discuss advances in the field that have shed light on clinical observations, mechanistic insights and options for the treatment of disuse osteoporosis. Clinical settings of disuse osteoporosis include spinal cord injury, other neurological and neuromuscular disorders, immobilization after fractures and bed rest (real or modeled). Furthermore, spaceflight-induced bone loss represents a well-known adaptive process to microgravity. Clinical studies have outlined that immobilization leads to immediate bone loss in both the trabecular and cortical compartments accompanied by relatively increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. The fact that the low bone formation state has been linked to high levels of the osteocyte-secreted protein sclerostin is one of the many findings that has brought matrix-embedded, mechanosensitive osteocytes into focus in the search for mechanistic principles. Previous basic research has primarily involved rodent models based on tail suspension, spaceflight and other immobilization methods, which have underlined the importance of osteocytes in the pathogenesis of disuse osteoporosis. Furthermore, molecular-based in vitro and in vivo approaches have revealed that osteocytes sense mechanical loading through mechanosensors that translate extracellular mechanical signals to intracellular biochemical signals and regulate gene expression. Osteocytic mechanosensors include the osteocyte cytoskeleton and dendritic processes within the lacuno-canalicular system (LCS), ion channels (e.g., Piezo1), extracellular matrix, primary cilia, focal adhesions (integrin-based) and hemichannels and gap junctions (connexin-based). Overall, disuse represents one of the major factors contributing to immediate bone loss and osteoporosis, and alterations in osteocytic pathways appear crucial to the bone loss associated with unloading.

The analysis of reactivity of LP in different experimental situations has shown that at healthy persons during passive listening had similar values for all kinds of stimulus, and an account situation the maximum values--for significant stimulus. For liquidators the type of reaction in the form of increase in LP values at the majority of stimulus in both experimental situations. The analysis of regional LP changes of component P300 has found out the maximum distinctions between groups in frontal area of the left hemisphere. Along with it at liquidators the type the reactions similar for all shown stimulus without dependence from their importance in comparison with norm is revealed ""uneconomical, superfluous"". It can testify about decreasing of attention and memory reserves and to promote disorder of the higher mental functions. The described of amplitude-time characteristics of component P300 of acoustical EP at liquidators EP can testify to delay of perception, processing and the information analysis in a combination to easing of inhibitory processes leading to the higher mental dysfunctions. The obtained data have similarity to people of old age, supporting a hypothesis about the accelerated ageing of a brain, and also about pathological development of processes of ageing as a result of influence of low doses of radiation.",Included

However, radiation has been implicated in the development of intracranial tumours. We describe three cases of radiation-induced meningiomas following high dose cranial irradiation. All these patients developed tumours within the previous radiation field and satisfied the criteria used for the definition of radiation-induced neoplasm. The interval between the irradiation and the onset of meningioma was significantly less in the younger patient. All the cases had several unique features of radiation-induced meningioma including features of atypical meningioma. Two patients developed multiple site meningiomas and one patient developed early recurrence of the tumour. This report confirms that patients exposed to cranial irradiation are at lifelong risk of developing radiation-induced tumours such as meningiomas. Hence these patients require long-term clinical and radiological surveillance to detect occurrence as early as possible.",Excluded

In this study, we evaluated the ability of irradiation to regulate the transcription of a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vector, Ad.Egr-1/lacZ, containing the radiation-inducible Egr-1 promoter driving the beta-galactosidase reporter gene in glioma cells. Transcripts of the Egr-1 gene in human and rat glioma cells were induced following irradiation with as little as 2 Gy. This dose was 10-fold less than previously reported, and comparable to doses of irradiation used clinically in standard fractionated radiotherapy for brain tumors. When 9L rat gliosarcoma cells were infected with Ad.Egr-1/lacZ in vitro and exposed to 2 Gy of external beam irradiation, there was a threefold increase in beta-galactosidase expression. Irradiation of intracerebral 9L tumors infected with the Ad.Egr-1/lacZ virus, using either external beam radiotherapy (2 Gy) or the thymidine analog 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine radiolabeled with the Auger electron emitter iodine-125 ([125I]IdUrd), also resulted in increased beta-galactosidase activity of the tumor cells. These results indicate that the use of viral vectors containing radiation-inducible promoters represents a novel therapeutic approach that enables gene therapy to be spatially and temporally regulated by ionizing radiation. These findings also support a potential role for radiation-inducible promoters in the treatment of malignant brain tumors.",Excluded

The 1-year local control rates after single-fraction stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for brain metastases >3 cm diameter are less than 70%, but with fractionated SRT (FSRT) higher local control rates have been reported. The purpose of this study was to compare our treatment results with SRT and FSRT for large brain metastases.Materials and methods. In two consecutive periods, 41 patients with 46 brain metastases received SRT with 1 fraction of 15 Gy, while 51 patients with 65 brain metastases received FSRT with 3 fractions of 8 Gy. We included patients with brain metastases with a planning target volume of >13 cm3 or metastases in the brainstem.Results. The minimum follow-up of patients still alive was 22 months. Comparing 1 fraction of 15 Gy with 3 fractions of 8 Gy, the 1-year rates of freedom from any local progression (54% and 61%, p=0.93) and pseudo progression (85% and 75%, p=0.25) were not significantly different. Overall survival rates were also not different.Conclusion. The 1-year local progression and pseudo progression rates after 1 fraction of 15 Gy or 3 fractions of 8 Gy for large brain metastases and metastases in the brainstem are similar. For better local control rates, FSRT schemes with a higher biological equivalent dose may be necessary. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Excluded

1533,"Fictive swimming motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish Larval zebrafish provide a unique model for investigating the mechanisms involved in generating rhythmic patterns of behavior, such as swimming, due to the array of techniques available including genetics, optical imaging, and conventional electrophysiology. Because electrophysiological and imaging studies of rhythmic motor behaviors in paralyzed preparations depend on the ability to monitor the central motor pattern, we developed a fictive preparation in which the activity of axial motor neurons was monitored using extracellular recordings from peripheral nerves. We examined spontaneous and light induced fictive motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish (4-6 days post-fertilization) paralyzed with curare. All spontaneous and light-induced preparations produced alternation of motor activity from side-to-side (mean contralateral phase = 50.7 +/- 7.0%; mean burst frequency = 35.6 +/- 4.7 Hz) and a progression of activity from head-to-tail (mean ipsilateral rostrocaudal delay = 0.8 +/- 0.5 ms per segment), consistent with lateral undulation and forward propulsion during swimming, respectively. The basic properties of the motor pattern were similar in spontaneous and light-induced swimming. This fictive preparation can be used in combination with conventional electrophysiological and imaging methods to investigate normal circuit function as well as to elucidate functional deficits in mutant lines. Toward this end, we show that two accordion class mutants, accordion and bandoneon, have alternating activity on opposite sides of the body, contradicting the hypothesis that their deficit results from the absence of the reciprocal glycinergic inhibition that is typically found in the spinal cord of swimming vertebrates.",Excluded

Cells were pre-treated with caffeine for inhibiting ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein/ATM and Rad-3-related protein) activation, wherever required.RESULTS: A 47-49 kDa protein band was observed with antibodies against three different epitopes, demonstrating conservation of respective domains in Sfp53. Immunoprecipitation also yielded similar-sized protein. Degenerate RT-PCR resulted in product of same size in both cell lines. Similar gel mobility shift of p53-binding oligonucleotide with BMG-1 and Sf9 cell lysates indicated analogous transcriptional activity of Sfp53. Constitutive Sfp53 level was higher than hp53 (human p53) and showed primarily cytoplasmic localization. Radiation-induced accumulation was considerably less in Sf9 even as an analogous ATM/ATR-dependent nuclear translocation was observed following gamma-irradiation and etoposide.CONCLUSIONS: A smaller-sized Sfp53 orthologue shows highly conserved native structure with DNA-binding, N-terminus and C-terminus domains, and has analogous p53 transcriptional activity. While its nuclear translocation and ATM/ATR dependence were similar to hp53, the cytoplasmic localization and subdued accumulation following gamma-irradiation indicate functional differences from human cells.",Included
3387,"Gain of rod to horizontal cell synaptic transfer: relation to glutamate release and a dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium current We related rod to horizontal cell synaptic transfer to glutamate release by rods. Simultaneous intracellular records were obtained from dark-adapted rod-horizontal cell pairs. Steady-state synaptic gain (defined as the ratio of horizontal cell voltage to rod voltage evoked by the same light stimulus) was 3.35 +/- 0.60 for dim flashes and 1.50 +/- 0.03 for bright flashes. Under conditions of maintained illumination, there was a measurable increment of horizontal cell hyperpolarization for each light-induced increment of rod hyperpolarization over the full range of rod voltages. In separate experiments we studied glutamate release from an intact, light-responsive photoreceptor layer, from which inner retinal layers were removed. Steady light reduced glutamate release as a monotonic function of intensity; spectral sensitivity measures indicated that we monitored glutamate release from rods. The dependence of glutamate release on rod voltage was well fit by the activation function for a high-voltage-activated, dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type calcium current, suggesting a linear dependence of glutamate release on [Ca]i in the synaptic terminal. A simple model incorporating this assumption accounts for the steady-state gain of the rod to horizontal cell synapse.",Excluded

3162,"Sequelae in long-term survivors of small cell lung cancer PURPOSE: Central nervous system (CNS) effects of chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) are studied in long-term small cell lung cancer (SCLC) survivors. The exact significance and pathogenesis of the neurotoxicity is still unknown, as studies on this subject lack sufficient patient numbers and are performed in an extremely varied manner.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-nine survivors (> 2 years from diagnosis) were examined neurologically and neuropsychologically, and underwent a cranial computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance (MR). Eight patients were excluded from further analysis for various reasons (not SCLC-related CNS disease, n = 6; no chemotherapy nor PCI treatment, n = 2). The remaining 51 patients were divided into three groups; group 1 = chemotherapy alone (n = 21), group 2 = sequential PCI (n = 19), and group 3 = concurrent or sandwiched PCI (n = 11). Groups were neuropsychologically compared in matched controls.RESULTS: Performance status did not differ significantly between various treatment groups; all patients remained ambulatory and capable of self-care. Mental impairment (n = 20), motor abnormalities (n = 9), and visual complaints (n = 1), were found in five patients in group 1 (24%), eight patients in group 2 (42%), and eight patients in group 3 (73%). Analysis of brain atrophy revealed no significant results; however, white matter abnormalities were found more frequently in group 3. Neuropsychologically no significant group differences existed, although interference sensitivity and difficulties with divided attention tended to occur more frequently in patients treated with PCI. Mean neuropsychometric results of treatment groups were significantly worse than those of matched controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although more intensively treated patients showed more neurologic impairment and patients in group 3 had more white matter abnormalities, there was no statistic evidence for additional neurotoxicity of PCI. Marked neuropsychometric differences between patients and matched controls may indicate that cognitive impairment is partly disease related, probably due to emotional distress and deteriorated physical condition.",Excluded

[Turkish] OBJECTIVES To evaluate the treatment results and prognostic factors in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer patients, retrospectively. METHODS Fifty-two patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer treated between 2005 and 2012, in our hospital were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS The 2-year overall survival and disease free survival rates were 48% and 15%. On univariate analysis T1 tumor (p=.012), concomittant chemoradiotherapy (p=.023), start of radiotherapy within the 3 months after diagnosis (p=.026) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (p=.025) significantly improved disease free survival rate. Concomittant chemoradiotherapy (p<.001), early radiotherapy (p<.001) and prophylactic cranial irradiaton (p=.001) significantly affected overall survival rate. On multivariate analysis, only prophylactic cranial irradiation was found to be an independent factor affecting overall survival rate (p=.003). CONCLUSION Our results were consistent with the literature even though small sample size. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was determined the only independent factor that affects overall survival.

Material(s) and Method(s): A Varian 2100 CD linac equipped witha 120 MLC, aSi 500 EPID and OBI system (v 1.5). A phantom containing a central tungsten ball (5 mm diameter) mimicking a target is used. The phantom was CT scanned in a Siemens Somaton scanner (planning CT, pCT) and imported into the Eclipse TPS (v. 10.0). The tungsten ball was delineated and a no-coplanar plan (WL plan) was added with its isocenter located at the ball center. The WL plan consisted of 10 smallfields (6X) of 2x2 cm size collimated with the Millennium 120 MLC of the linac (G0T0,G140T315, G140T270, G180T0, G220T90, G220T45, G270T0, G270T45, G90T0 and G90T315,where G: gantry and T: table, scale: Varian IEC). The WL plan includes a CBCT field setup. The phantom was setup in the linac by aligning the ball center with the room lasers. After that, intended shifts within +/- 1 cm were applied alongside the three translational directions of the table, in order to simulate a setup error of the phantom. CBCT was acquired (Gantryrotation: 360degree, FOV: 45 cm, matrix: 512x512 and slice distance: 1 mm) and 3D/3D match was performed using the pCTas reference. The required couch movements to correct the actual position ofthe target were applied in a remote way. After that, the WL plan was delivered and an integrated MV image for each field was acquired using the EPID. EPID was positioned at 80 cm below the linac isocenter, giving a pixel size of 0.4 mm. The WL plan was irradiated twelve times during a year (118 shots/images). Each recorded MV image was analysed with ImageJ software in order to measure the distance (2D) between the ball center and the field center. Each 2D distance was decomposed into the three anatomical directions (Left/Right, Anterior/Posterior and Superior/Inferior). Result(s): The analysis of the 118 MV images collected reported the following differences (mean and 95% CI) between the ball center and the radiation center: 1) L/R : 0.6 mm [95% CI: 1.4 mm] 2) AP/PA : 0.5 mm [95% CI: 1.2 mm] 3) Sup/Inf: 0.7 mm [95% CI: 1.6 mm] Conclusion(s): The isocenter accuracy was within 2 mm on each direction, when the CBCT technique is used for target localization. The results found in this study included inaccuracies due to gantry and couch rotations, remote couch movements and potential misalignments between the linac and the OBI isocenters.

3432,"Lack of the alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 causes tremors, seizures, and early postnatal death in mice The Na(+)-independent alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 (Asc-1) is exclusively expressed in neuronal structures throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Asc-1 transports small neutral amino acids with high affinity especially for D-serine and glycine (K(i): 8-12 microM), two endogenous glutamate co-agonists that activate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors through interacting with the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding-site. By regulating D-serine (and possibly glycine) levels in the synaptic cleft, Asc-1 may play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. We generated asc-1 gene knockout (asc-1(-/-)) mice to test this hypothesis. Behavioral phenotyping combined with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings revealed that asc-1(-/-) mice developed tremors, ataxia, and seizures that resulted in early postnatal death. Both tremors and seizures were reduced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Extracellular recordings from asc-1(-/-) brain slices indicated that the spontaneous seizure activity did not originate in the hippocampus, although, in this region, a relative increase in evoked synaptic responses was observed under nominal Mg(2+)-free conditions. Taken together with the known neurochemistry and neuronal distribution of the Asc-1 transporter, these results indicate that the mechanism underlying the behavioral hyperexcitability in mutant mice is likely due to overactivation of NMDA receptors, presumably resulting from elevated extracellular D-serine. Our study provides the first evidence to support the notion that Asc-1 transporter plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability, and indicate that the transporter is vital for normal CNS function and essential to postnatal survival of mice.",Excluded

These were also discussed in open session at the 16th International Leksell Gamma Knife Society Meeting in Sydney, Australia, in March 2012 and approved subject to certain revisions and the performance of an Internet vote for approval from the whole Society. This ballot was undertaken in September 2012.RESULTS: The recommendations in relation to volumes are that Gross Target Volume (GTV) should replace Target Volume (TV); Prescription Isodose Volume (PIV) should generally be used; the term Treated Target Volume (TTV) should replace TVPIV, GTV in PIV, and so forth; and the Volume of Accepted Tolerance Dose (VATD) should be used in place of irradiated volume. For dose prescription and measurement, the prescription dose should be supplemented by the Absorbed Dose, or DV% (for example, D95%), the maximum and minimum dose should be related to a specific tissue volume (for example, D2% or preferably D1 mm3), and the median dose (D50%) should be recorded routinely. The Integral Dose becomes the Total Absorbed Energy (TAE). In the assessment of planning quality, the use of the Target Coverage Ratio (TTV/ GTV), Paddick Conformity Index (PCI = TTV2/[GTV . PIV]), New Conformity Index (NCI = [GTV . PIV]/TTV2), Selectivity Index (TTV/PIV), Homogeneity Index (HI = [D2% -D98%]/D50%), and Gradient Index (GI = PIV0.5/PIV) are reemphasized. In relation to the dose to Organs at Risk (OARs), the emphasis is on dose volume recording of the VATD or the dose/volume limit (for example, V10) in most cases, with the additional use of a Maximum Dose to a small volume (such as 1 mm3) and/or a Point Dose and Mean Point Dose in certain circumstances, particularly when referring to serial organs. The recommendations were accepted by the International Leksell Gamma Knife Society by a vote of 92% to 8%.CONCLUSIONS: An agreed-upon and uniform terminology and subsequent standardization of certain methods and procedures will advance the clinical science of stereotactic radiosurgery.",Excluded

New information indicates that it confers a survival benefit for limited or extensive stage SCLC patients gaining a complete response in the chest. A review of causes of cerebral dysfunction as a complication indicates that such problems can be due to suboptimal radiation fractionation, chemotherapy, or an inappropriate combination of prophylactic brain irradiation with chemotherapy. Optimum treatment with prophylactic brain irradiation has been shown not to cause adverse effects with detailed psychometric testing. Several additional sources of information can be drawn together to suggest a dose-response pattern for prophylactic brain irradiation, leading to the recommendation that a dose of 25-36 Gy is optimal, delivered in 2-3 Gy daily fractions after the completion of chest irradiation and chemotherapy. This will be better defined in future clinical trials. [References: 32]",Excluded

Recent data have shown an in vitro synergy of the HDAC inhibitor S78454 (also called PCI- 24781) with ionizing radiation, via inhibition of homologous recombinational (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We propose in this study to investigate the in vivo radiosensitizer effect of S78454 on human glioblastoma model. For this, we generated orthotopic U87 human glioblastoma xenografts in nude mice. Intra-peritoneal (i.p.) S 78454 treatment was performed daily starting 10 days after the engraftment. Irradiation was performed in one daily 2 Gy localized fraction during 4 days followed by a second similar 4 days treatment performed after 3 days off (for a total dose of 16 Gy administrated on 11 days). Survival experiments were conducted in mice bearing xenografts in the four different groups of treatment (vehicle, S 78454 alone, radiation alone, S 78454 + radiation). Mice bearing orthotopic xenografts were sacrificed at the onset of neurological signs. Survival curves were then performed. We first determined the S78454 dosing schedule to obtain a pharmacodynamic effect of the compound in the xenograft. Inhibition of RAD 51 expression, histone H3 and tubulin acetylation in the tumor were obtained 24 hours after daily i.p. treatment with 50mg/kg S78454. These results allowed us to define the schedule treatment combining S78454 with radiotherapy: mice were treated with S78454 50 mg/kg/d i.p., daily from Days 10 to14 and then from Days 17 to 21; one 2 Gy fraction radiotherapy was performed daily from Days 11 to14 and Days 18 to 21. In these conditions of treatment, S78454 was well tolerated Survival of the mice treated with S78454 alone was not significantly increased while the survival of the mice treated with irradiation alone was significantly increased compared to the control group (P<0.05). In contrast, the survival of the mice treated with the combined treatment was significantly increased compared to the group of animals treated with irradiation alone (P<0.05) and to the group treated with S78454 alone (P<0.01).

912,"Recurrent non-functioning pituitary adenomas: a review on the new pathological classification, management guidelines and treatment options At least 50% of surgically resected non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) recur. Either early or late adjuvant radiotherapy is highly efficacious in controlling recurrent NFPA but associates potentially burdensome complications like hypopituitarism, vascular complications or secondary neoplasm. Reoperation is indicated in bulky tumor rests compressing the optic pathway. To date, no standardized medical therapy is available for recurrent NFPA although cabergoline and temozolomide show promising results. Guidelines on the management of recurrent NFPAs are now available. The new 2017 WHO pituitary tumor classification, based on immunohistochemistry and transcription factor assessment, identifies a group of aggressive NFPA variants that may benefit from earlier adjuvant therapy. Nevertheless, NFPA patients exhibit a reduced overall life expectancy largely due to hypopituitarism and treatment-related morbidity. The management of recurrent NFPA benefits from a multidisciplinary teamwork of surgeons, endocrinologists, radiation oncologists, ophthalmologists, pathologists and neuro-radiologists in order to provide individualized therapy and anticipate deterioration.

1980,"Efficacy of salvage stereotactic radiotherapy for recurrent glioma: impact of tumor morphology and method of target delineation on local control In this study, we assessed the efficacy of salvage stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for recurrent glioma. From August 2008 to December 2012, 30 patients with recurrent glioma underwent salvage SRT. The initial histological diagnoses were World Health Organization (WHO) grades II, III, and IV in 6, 9, and 15 patients, respectively. Morphologically, the type of recurrence was classified as diffuse or other. Two methods of clinical target delineation were used: A, a contrast-enhancing tumor; or B, a contrast-enhancing tumor with a 3-10-mm margin and/or surrounding fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) high-intensity areas. The prescribed dose was 22.5-35 Gy delivered in five fractions at an isocenter using a dynamic conformal arc technique. The overall survival (OS) and local control probability (LCP) after SRT were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A univariate analysis was used to test the effect of clinical variables on OS/LCP. The median follow-up period was 272 days after SRT. The OS and LCP were 83% and 56% at 6 months after SRT, respectively. Morphologically, the tumor type correlated significantly with both OS and LCP (P = 0.006 and <0.001, respectively). The method of target delineation also had a significant influence on LCP (P = 0.016). Grade 3 radiation necrosis was observed in two patients according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3. Salvage SRT was safe and effective for recurrent glioma, especially non-diffuse recurrences. Improved local control might be obtained by adding a margin to contrast-enhancing tumors or including increased FLAIR high-intensity areas.",Excluded
2280,"Low-Dose and Limited-Volume Radiotherapy Alone for Primary Dural Marginal Zone Lymphoma: Treatment Approach and Review of Published Data Purpose: Primary dural lymphoma is a rare intracranial lymphoma that almost always has a marginal zone histologic type and immunophenotype and often remains localized and is thus potentially curable with radiotherapy (RT) alone. The unusual location and histologic type of primary dural marginal zone lymphoma (PDMZL) distinguish it from primary central nervous system lymphoma and poses treatment dilemmas of technique, volume, and dose that have not been well addressed. We set out to analyze our recent experience in treating PDMZL and reviewed the limited published data available. Methods and Materials: Between 2002 and 2006, we treated 5 patients with localized PDMZL. Of these 5 patients, 3 had unilateral and 2 had bilateral/multifocal involvement, and 3 underwent subtotal tumor resection and 2 biopsy only. Whole brain RT was given before involved-field RT (IFRT) in 4 patients and 1 received IFRT alone. The median whole brain RT, IFRT, and total RT dose was 20, 12, and 30 Gy, respectively. The planning computed tomography scan was always fused with the post-gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging scan to assist in the IFRT volume determination. We also analyzed the published data from 27 additional patients. Result(s): The median follow-up was 34 months (range, 31-52). All obtained lasting local control. One patient developed a relapse in the soft tissue of the flank and additional systemic progression but no central nervous system recurrence. At last follow-up, no significant treatment-related neurotoxicity was detected. Conclusion(s): The results of our study have demonstrated that a combination of whole brain RT/IFRT or even low-dose IFRT alone provides excellent durable local control of PDMZL. This approach is potentially curative, possibly without significant neurotoxicity. Additional study and longer follow-up are needed to determine the appropriate RT dose and volume parameters for this rare, debilitating, and yet potentially curable lymphoma. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

39,"Diffusion tensor imaging contributes to differentiate Richardson's syndrome from progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism Objective: Abnormal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of the superior cerebellar peduncles were reported in patients with Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS). A few studies showed that PSP-RS patients had DTI alterations also in the corpus callosum, internal capsulae, and long-range white matter (WM) tracts. However, most of the previous studies did not include the atypical clinical presentations of PSP. The aims of this study were to investigate the regional distribution of WM damage in patients with PSP-RS and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism (PSP-P) using DTI, and quantify the DTI classificatory ability in diagnosing PSP syndromes, when used in combination with infratentorial volumetry. Method(s): In 37 PSP (21 PSP-RS, 16 PSP-P) and 42 controls, tractbased spatial statistics was applied. DTI metrics were derived from supratentorial, thalamic, and infratentorial tracts. Brain atrophy was investigated using voxel-based morphometry. The MR parkinsonism index (MRPI), a combined conventional MRI measurement taking into account the midbrain and pons areas and the SCP and middle cerebellar peduncle widths, was calculated. Result(s): In PSP, grey matter (GM) atrophy involved fronto-temporal lobes and basal ganglia, and was greater in PSP-RS than PSP-P. PSP-RS had a more severe and distributed WM loss, including the midbrain, SCP, and prefrontal and motor/premotor regions. All PSP harboured diffusivity abnormalities in the corpus callosum, frontoparietal and fronto-temporo-occipital tracts. Infratentorial WM and thalamic radiations were severely affected in PSP-RS and relatively spared in PSP-P. When MRPI and DTI measures were combined, the discriminatory power increased from 0.92 to 0.98 for PSP-RS vs. controls, from 0.70 to 0.82 for PSP-P vs. controls, and from 0.77 to 0.84 for PSP-RS vs. PSP-P. Conclusion(s): Distinct patterns of GM and WM alterations occur in PSP-RS and PSP-P. Adding DTI measures to MRPI improves the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating each PSP syndrome from healthy individuals and each other.",Excluded
1929,"Nitric oxide as a mediator of parasympathetic vasodilation in ocular and extraocular tissues in the rabbit Purpose. The aim of this study was to investigate in rabbits the relationship between nitric oxide and the noncholinergic vasodilation caused by facial nerve stimulation in the eye and some extraocular tissues. Methods. Uveal vascular resistance was determined by measuring simultaneously the flow from a cannulated vortex vein with intraocular pressure and arterial blood pressure recordings. The local blood flow in different parts of the eye (iris, ciliary body, choroid, and retina), eyelids, nictitating membrane, Harderian gland, and lacrimal gland was determined using radioactive microspheres. The effects of facial nerve stimulation, at different frequencies, were examined before and alter the administration of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors. Results. In the experiments with direct determination of uveal blood flow, stimulation of the facial nerve caused a frequency-dependent decrease in uveal vascular resistance, indicating vasodilation. This effect was reduced or abolished by NOS inhibition at low frequencies but was unaffected at high frequencies. Determination of regional blood flow, with radioactive microspheres, showed that the stimulation increased local blood flow in all parts of the urea. Compared to the nonstimulated control side, stimulation at 2 Hz increased choroidal blood flow by 89% +/- 12% before NOS inhibition and by 45% +/- 10% after NOS inhibition, a difference of 44% +/- 77% (n = 9; P <= 0.05). Iris and ciliary body vasodilation appeared to be equally reduced. In eyelids, Harderian gland, and lacrimal gland, the vasodilation elicited by stimulation at 2 Hz was abolished almost completely by NOS inhibition. The vasodilation in most of the extraocular tissues was reduced significantly by NOS inhibition at 5 Hz, with only a slight reduction in the choroid, iris, and ciliary body. Retinal blood flow also was significantly increased by facial nerve stimulation at 2 Hz and 5 Hz. The increase in retinal blood flow appeared to be more sensitive to NOS inhibition than the increase in uveal blood flow. Conclusions. These results suggest that the formation of nitric oxide plays an important role in the uveal, retinal, and extraocular vasodilation brought about by facial nerve stimulation at low frequencies. At high frequencies, other neurotransmitters also seem to be involved.",Excluded

2523,"COX-2 inhibitor as a radiation enhancer: New strategies for the treatment of lung cancer Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality throughout the world, and the incidence continues to increase. Smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer. Emerging data have implicated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostanoid production in the pathogenesis of lung carcinoma. In invasive lung tumors, COX-2 upregulation has been reported in up to 90% of cases. COX-2 upregulation is an early event in the development of non-small-cell lung cancer and may be integral to the development of new blood vessels and production of specific proteases that are critical to growth and spread of lung malignancies. COX-2 inhibitors are known to enhance the chemosensitivity in COX-2 overexpressing lung cancer cell lines. Recently, we have demonstrated that selective COX-2 inhibitors also enhance the effect of radiation in COX-2 overexpressed cells. Therefore, inhibitors of COX-2 in combination with chemoradiation therapy may be an alternative strategy that can be tested in clinical trials. The combination of COX-2 inhibitors and radiation suggest a complementary strategy to target angiogenesis while potentially minimizing the impact on quality of life. Currently, several groups are conducting clinical trials in cervix cancer, lung cancer, and brain tumors, using inhibitors of COX-2 in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These clinical trials will help to elucidate the role of this interesting class.",Excluded

For this purpose, pregnant F344 rats were given a single administration of N-ethylnitrosourea (ENU) on gestational day 18. A total of 500 pups were divided into five groups, each composed of 50 males and 50 females: Group 1, untreated controls; Group 2, ENU alone; Groups 3 to 5, ENU + EMF (sham exposure and two exposure levels). A 1.95-GHz wide-band code division multiple access (W-CDMA) signal, which is a feature of the International Mobile Telecommunication 2000 (IMT-2000) cellular system was employed for exposure of the rat head starting from 5 weeks of age, 90 min a day, 5 days a week, for 104 weeks.

1396,"Divergent effects of irradiation on brain cortical morphology in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: one-year follow-up study using structural magnetic resonance imaging Background: Increasing evidence indicates that radiotherapy (RT)-induced brain cortical deficits may play a critical role in developing radiation encephalopathy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the evolutional processes of RT-induced cortical injury have not been sufficiently investigated. This study investigates RT-induced effects on cortical morphology using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in NPC patients.Methods: Using MRI-based morphometry with surface-based measures, we evaluated the longitudinal alterations of cortical volume (CV), cortical thickness (CT), and cortical surface area (CSA) in 104 NPC patients at pre-RT (n=104), within 3 months post-RT (n=92), 6 months post-RT (n=71), and 9-12 months post-RT (n=52). Twenty healthy controls were also evaluated in parallel. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories of RT-related changes in cortical brain morphology and its association with irradiation dose, with healthy controls data being used to construct a normal age-related benchmark. The level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.Results: The results showed that RT-related longitudinal alterations in cortical morphology underwent two diverse patterns during the first year of follow up in NPC patients. The temporal cortices (including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus, and the right inferior temporal and right transverse temporal gyrus), the basal occipital cortices (the right lingual gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus), and the basal frontal cortices (the right lateral orbitofrontal gyrus) showed time-dependent attenuation in cortical morphology indices. Furthermore, these effects on multiple cortices were dose-dependent, suggesting they were RT-associated. In contrast, in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus, there was a time-dependent increase in CT.Conclusions: Our preliminary findings revealed divergent effects of irradiation on cortical brain morphology. These results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of irradiation-related neurotoxic effects on cortical brain morphology and will help guide the investigation of critically neuroprotective strategies.",Included

[Chinese] To compare the dosimetric differences of dosiology between intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy (IMAT) and dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (dIMRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. CT data from 25 patients treated in our radiotherapy center were selected randomly for this study. For each patient, the IMAT technique and the fixed beam dIMRT technique were accomplished by the simultaneously integrated boost. Dose volume histogram (DVH) data, isodose distribution, monitor units (MUs) and treatment time were compared in the two techniques. There was no significant difference between the IMAT and the dIMRT in dose received by 95% of target volumes (D(95)) (P>0.05). Overall, the mean dose (D(mean)), maximal dose (D(max)) and volume percentage receiving at least of 107% of the prescribed dose (V(107%)) of planning target volume (PTV) for the IMAT were increased slightly ,compared with the dlMRT (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in dosimetric indices of organs at risk (OARs) including spinal cord,optical nerves,lens and temporomandibular joints in the two techniques (P>0.05). Compared with the dlMRI, the D(max) of brain stem for the IMAT was increased slightly (P<0.05). Similar trends was observed for the D(mean) and dose received by 50% of volume (D(50)) of the left and right parotid glands (P<0.05). Healthy tissue (defined as the volume of the body minus PTV,B-P) irradiated from 800 cGy in the IMAT was higher, and that from 1200-4500 cGy was lower compared with the dlMRI (P<0.05).The average number of MUs was reduced by 62.7% per fraction, and the treatment time was on average reduced by 60.1% per fraction in the IMAT compared with the dlMRI. There is a slight difference in dosiology between the two radiotherapy techniques investigated, but they both meet the clinical requirement. Compared with the dIMRT, the IMAT delivers less irradiation to healthy tissue, uses fewer MUs and takes less time during radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",Excluded

To compare both paddles one additional image with RP was made, consisting of either a mediolateral-oblique (MLO) or craniocaudal-view (CC). Pain experience was scored using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Projected breast area was estimated using computer software. Radiation dose was estimated using the model by Dance. Image quality was reviewed by three radiologists and three radiographers.RESULTS: There was no difference in pain experience between both paddles (mean difference NRS: 0.08 +/- 0.08, p = 0.32). Mean radiation dose was 4.5 % lower with FP (0.09 +/- 0.01 p = 0.00). On MLO-images, the projected breast area was 0.79 % larger with FP. Paired evaluation of image quality indicated that FP removed fibroglandular tissue from the image area and reduced contrast in the clinically relevant retroglandular area at chest wall side.CONCLUSIONS: Although FP performed slightly better in the projected breast area, it moved breast tissue from the image area at chest wall side. RP showed better contrast, especially in the retroglandular area. We therefore recommend the use of RP for standard MLO and CC views.",Excluded
1869,"The role of mislocalized phototransduction in photoreceptor cell death of retinitis pigmentosa Most of inherited retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) cause photoreceptor cell death resulting in blindness. RP is a large family of diseases in which the photoreceptor cell death can be caused by a number of pathways. Among them, light exposure has been reported to induce photoreceptor cell death. However, the detailed mechanism by which photoreceptor cell death is caused by light exposure is unclear. In this study, we have shown that even a mild light exposure can induce ectopic phototransduction and result in the acceleration of rod photoreceptor cell death in some vertebrate models. In ovl, a zebrafish model of outer segment deficiency, photoreceptor cell death is associated with light exposure. The ovl larvae show ectopic accumulation of rhodopsin and knockdown of ectopic rhodopsin and transducin rescue rod photoreceptor cell death. However, knockdown of phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that mediates the next step of phototransduction, does not. So, ectopic phototransduction activated by light exposure, which leads to rod photoreceptor cell death, is through the action of transducin. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that forced activation of adenylyl cyclase in the inner segment leads to rod photoreceptor cell death. For further confirmation, we have also generated a transgenic fish which possesses a human rhodopsin mutation, Q344X. This fish and rd10 model mice show photoreceptor cell death caused by adenylyl cyclase. In short, our study indicates that in some RP, adenylyl cyclase is involved in photoreceptor cell death pathway; its inhibition is potentially a logical approach for a novel RP therapy.",Excluded

Final results of a multicentric pilot study for the Groupe Lyonnias d'Oncologie Thoracique (GLOT) In order to evaluate the effect on prolonging survival of alternating chemotherapy and radiotherapy schedules in patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer, 89 patients were included in a multi-institutional pilot study between January 1986 and May 1989. Treatment consisted of induction chemotherapy using the combination of doxorubicin, etoposide and ifosfamide (AVI) for four consecutive courses, followed by two cycles of the VI chemotherapy alternating with three hyperfractionated radiotherapy courses and then followed by two additional courses of AVI. Objective response to the four cycles of AVI combination was observed in 65 patients (75%). Thirteen out of 30 patients (44%) who were in partial response (PR) after induction chemotherapy were converted into complete response (CR) after the three alternating courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The principal side effect related to combined modality treatment was acute radiation pneumonitis (21.5% cases) reversible except one which resulted in toxic death, and a second with chronic lung fibrosis with permanent WHO Grade 2 dyspnea (14%). Local relapse was observed in 47% of the patients who were considered in CR at the end of the treatment program and cerebral metastases were the first site of detectable relapse in 25% cases. The 3-year actuarial disease-free survival of the 89 patients is 5%, and the median actuarial survival is 14 months.

Complete and partial response in both groups was comparable, and the overall survival was comparable. However, relapse-free survival was significantly higher in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and irradiation in comparison with the radiotherapy alone group. Disease-free survival was higher in the concomitant chemotherapy-radiotherapy patients, although survival was not significantly modified, probably because of suboptimal chemotherapy. The initial intrathoracic failure rate was 40.7% inthe concomitant chemotherapy-irradiation group, compared with 53.8% in the radiotherapy-alone patients. None of the patients receiving delayed chemotherapy following the radiotherapy recurrence showed significant tumor response to the drugs. The incidence of distant metastasis was slightly lower in the chemotherapy groups. Brain metastases were noted in 7% of the patients in both groups. Increased intrathoracic recurrences were noted in patients with lower doses of irradiation. Nine of 13 patients treated with inadequate portals developed intrathoracic recurrences in comparison to 13 of 40 treated with adequate irradiation fields.

3597,"Targeting the NF-E2-related factor 2 pathway: A novel strategy for glioblastoma (Review) Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant subtype among all brain tumors. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an essential component of cellular defense against a variety of endogenous and exogenous stresses. A marked increase in research over the past few decades focusing on Nrf2 and its role in regulating glioblastoma has revealed the potential value of Nrf2 in the treatment of glioblastoma. In the present review, we discuss a novel framework of Nrf2 in the regulation of glioblastoma and the mechanisms regarding the downregulation of Nrf2 in treating glioblastoma. The candidate mechanisms include direct and indirect means. Direct mechanisms target tumor molecular pathways in order to overcome resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, to inhibit proliferation, to block invasion and migration, to induce apoptosis, to promote differentiation, to enhance autophagy and to target glioblastoma stem cells. Indirect mechanisms target the reaction between glioblastoma cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Overall, the value of the Nrf2 pathway in glioblastoma provides a promising opportunity for new approaches by which to treat glioblastoma.",Excluded

In each cell line, formation and removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) were measured in the individual strands of the actively transcribed DHFR gene and in a transcriptionally inactive region downstream of DHFR. AA8 cells efficiently remove CPDs from the transcribed strand, but not from either the non-transcribed strand or the inactive region. There was no detectable repair of CPDs in any region of the genome in UV61. Transfection of the human CSB gene into UV61 restores the normal repair pattern (CPD removal in only the transcribed strand), demonstrating that the DNA repair defect in UV61 is homologous to that in Cockayne's syndrome (complementation group B) cells. However, we observe no significant deficiency in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in UV61, suggesting that the CSB protein has independent roles in DNA repair and RNA transcription pathways.",Excluded
753,"Mitigation of radiation myelopathy and reduction of microglial infiltration by Ramipril, ACE inhibitor STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Ramipril, as a mitigator of radiation-induced spinal cord injury.SETTING: Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.METHODS: Total of 22 rats were irradiated with single doses of 23.6-33 Gy at the C4-T2 spinal levels. After irradiation, the rats were randomized to the radiation only control group and the Ramipril-treated (radiation + Ramipril) experimental group. Ramipril 1.5 mg/kg/day was given in the drinking water starting 1 week after radiation through the study duration.RESULTS: All the rats irradiated with 28.5-33 Gy became paralyzed at 125 +/- 4 days, whereas no rats became paralyzed after 23.6 Gy. The time to develop paralysis was delayed to 135 +/- 4 days in Ramipril-treated group (P < 0.001). H&E and LFB showed microscopic structural restoration and remyelination with Ramipril treatment. VEGF expression was increased in the irradiated spinal cord, and the number of VEGF-positive cells was significantly decreased by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.001). Immunohistochemical stain with Iba-1 showed increased microglial infiltration in the irradiated spinal cords. The number of Iba-1-positive microglia was significantly reduced by Ramipril treatment (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Ramipril reduced the rate of paralysis even at the paralysis-inducing radiation doses. It also significantly delayed the onset of paralysis. Neuroinflammation and endothelial cell damage may be the key mediators of radiation injury. Ramipril can be readily translatable to clinical application as a mitigatory of radiotherapeutic toxicity.",Excluded
3265,"Total body 100-mGy X-irradiation does not induce Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis or memory impairment in mice The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood. Possible cognitive and behavioral consequences induced by low-dose radiation are important because humans are exposed to ionizing radiation from various sources. Early transcriptional response in murine brain to low-dose X-rays (100 mGy) has been reported, suggesting alterations of molecular networks and pathways associated with cognitive functions, advanced aging and AD. To investigate acute and late transcriptional, pathological and cognitive consequences of low-dose radiation, we applied an acute dose of 100-mGy total body irradiation (TBI) with X-rays to C57BL/6J Jms mice. We collected hippocampi and analyzed expression of 84 AD-related genes. Mouse learning ability and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze test. We performed in vivo PET scans with (11)C-PIB, a radiolabeled ligand for amyloid imaging, to detect fibrillary amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation, and examined characteristic AD pathologies with immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein (APP), Abeta, tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). mRNA studies showed significant downregulation of only two of 84 AD-related genes, Apbb1 and Lrp1, at 4 h after irradiation, and of only one gene, Il1alpha, at 1 year after irradiation. Spatial learning ability and memory were not significantly affected at 1 or 2 years after irradiation. No induction of amyloid fibrillogenesis or changes in APP, Abeta, tau, or p-tau expression was detected at 4 months or 2 years after irradiation. TBI induced early or late transcriptional alteration in only a few AD-related genes but did not significantly affect spatial learning, memory or AD-like pathological change in mice.",Included
1812,"Tracking target position variability using intraprostatic fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging in prostate cancer radiotherapy Modern radiotherapy has achieved substantial improvement in tumour control and toxicity rates by escalating the total dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding normal tissues. It has therefore become necessary to precisely track tumour position in order to minimise geometrical uncertainties due to setup errors and organ motion. We conducted this prospective evaluation of prostate cancer patients treated with image-guided conformal radiation therapy at our institution. We implanted three fiducial markers (gold seeds) within the prostatic gland in order to quantify daily target displacements and to generate specific margins around the clinical target volume (CTV) to create an appropriate planned target volume (PTV). Between April and December 2009, ten patients affected with localised prostate cancer were transrectally implanted with three radio-opaque markers. Each patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan for planning purposes following proper bladder and rectum preparation. During treatment two orthogonal images were acquired daily and compared with previously generated digitally reconstructed radiographs. After manual localisation, comparison between the position of the gold seeds on the portal and reference images was carried out, and a set of extrapolated lateral-lateral (LL), anterior-posterior (AP) and cranial-caudal (CC) shift corrections was calculated and recorded. Couch corrections were applied with a threshold of 3 mm displacement. Systematic and random errors for each direction were calculated either as measured according to displacement of the gold seeds prior to any couch movement and after couch position correction according to the radio-opaque markers. For skin marks, mean systematic and random errors were 0.12+2.94 mm for LL, 1.04+3.37 mm for AP, -1.14+2.71 mm for CC, whereas for seed markers, mean and systematic errors were 0.6+1.5 mm for LL, 0.51+2.45 mm for AP and -0.25+2.51 mm for CC. A scatter plot generated on all measurements after couch repositioning according to gold-seed displacement suggested a confidence range of shift distributions within 5 mm for LL, 8 mm for CC, and 7 mm for AP. The total systematic and random components were then used to calculate proper PTV in patients receiving conventional treatment (7 mm for LL and 9 mm for both AP and CC). Prostate positional variability during a course of radiation treatment is strongly influenced by setup and organ motion. Organ tracking through fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging is able to reduce the spread of displacements, significantly contributing to improve the ballistic precision of radiation delivery.",Excluded
2619,"The centrosomal, putative tumor suppressor protein TACC2 is dispensable for normal development, and deficiency does not lead to cancer TACC2 is a member of the transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein family and is associated with the centrosome-spindle apparatus during cell cycling. In vivo, the TACC2 gene is expressed in various splice forms predominantly in postmitotic tissues, including heart, muscle, kidney, and brain. Studies of human breast cancer samples and cell lines suggest a putative role of TACC2 as a tumor suppressor protein. To analyze the physiological role of TACC2, we generated mice lacking TACC2. TACC2-deficient mice are viable, develop normally, are fertile, and lack phenotypic changes compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, TACC2 deficiency does not lead to an increased incidence of tumor development. Finally, in TACC2-deficient embryonic fibroblasts, proliferation and cell cycle progression as well as centrosome numbers are comparable to those in wild-type cells. Therefore, TACC2 is not required, nonredundantly, for mouse development and normal cell proliferation and is not a tumor suppressor protein.",Excluded
2976,"Determination of the sizes of the opioid receptors in their membrane environment by radiation inactivation Opioids, like other drugs, are thought to initiate their effects by association with their specific receptors. However, very little is known about the opioid receptor as a molecular entity. The binding components have been solubilized in detergent and purified by different approaches, but the molecular size of soluble opioid receptor complexes reported by different groups varied from 23,000 to 750,000. In this study, the technique of radiation inactivation by gamma rays was used to investigate the apparent size of the opioid receptor in rat brain membranes under different conditions. The molecular sizes of opioid receptor complexes were estimated as 313,000 +/- 13,500 in the presence of [D-Ala2, D-Leu5] enkephalin, NaCl and Gpp (NH)p; as 165,000 +/- 8,500 in the presence of NaCl only, or of both NaCl and Gpp (NH)p; as 217,000 +/- 6,600 in the presence of Gpp (NH)p only; and as 286,000 +/- 60,900 in the presence of MgCl2 only.

3124,"Edaravone protects ovaries from radiation-induced apoptosis Objective: Ovaries are very sensitive and prone to radiation-related damage. Radiation impairs the ovaries by triggering apoptosis of follicular cells and chromosomal damage and oxidative stress. Edaravone is a potent free radical scavenger, which has been clinically used to treat the neuronal damage following acute ischemic stroke. Our purpose is to evaluate the protective effects of edaravone and to investigate the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in rat ovaries after radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty two Wistar albino female rats were randomly divided into four groups. 1: control group, 2: sham group (only radiation), 3: 450 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group, 4: 45 mg/kg edaravone and radiation group. Four days after radiation exposure, the rats were sacrificed and the ovaries were removed. Histologic changes under light microscopy and immunoreactivity for anticaspase-3 were noted and compared between the four groups. Result(s): There was a statistically significant difference in follicle counts, vascular congestion, edema, cytoplasmic vacuolization and interstitial cell degeneration between the groups. Radiation causes deterioration of histopathological parameters. Administration of edaravone at different doses seems to reverse these alterations and alleviate the injury. Antioxidant defense mechanisms appear to be enhanced by edaravone. Conclusion(s): This is the first study evaluating the protective effects of edaravone on radiation-induced ovarian damage. Edaravone decreased the follicule apoptosis and attenuates ovarian damage induced radiation in rats.",Included

Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the informed consent requirement. Seventy-five patients with pathologic analysis-confirmed recurrent glioblastoma (n = 42) or radiation necrosis (n = 33) who presented with enlarged contrast material-enhanced lesions at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after they completed concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy were enrolled. The diagnostic performance of the total MP cluster score was determined by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with cross-validation and compared with those of single parameter measurements (10% histogram cutoffs of apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC10] or 90% histogram cutoffs of normalized cerebral blood volume and initial time-signal intensity AUC). Results Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that an AUC for differentiating recurrent glioblastoma from delayed radiation necrosis was highest in the total MP cluster score and lowest for ADC10 for both readers. The total MP cluster score had significantly better diagnostic accuracy than any single parameter (corrected P = .001-.039 for reader 1; corrected P = .005-.041 for reader 2). The total MP cluster score was the best predictor of recurrent glioblastoma (cross-validated AUCs, 0.942-0.946 for both readers), with a sensitivity of 95.2% for reader 1 and 97.6% for reader 2. Conclusion Quantitative analysis with volume-weighted voxel-based MP clustering appears to be superior to the use of single imaging parameters to differentiate recurrent glioblastoma from delayed radiation necrosis. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded
482,"Radiosurgery of the rat hippocampus: magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological, histological, and behavioral studies OBJECTIVE: To explore the histological, electrophysiological, radiological, and behavioral effects of radiosurgery using a new model of proton beam radiosurgery (PBR) of the rodent hippocampus.METHODS: Forty-one rats underwent PBR of the right hippocampus with nominal doses of 5 to 130 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE). Three control animals were untreated. Three months after PBR, 41 animals were evaluated with the Morris water maze, 23 with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and 22 with intrahippocampal microelectrode recordings. Animals that were studied physiologically were killed, and their brains were examined with Nissl staining and immunocytochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase, heat shock protein 72 (HSP-72), parvalbumin, calmodulin, calretinin, calbindin, and somatostatin.RESULTS: Ninety and 130 CGE resulted in decreased performance in the Morris water maze, increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diminished granule cell field potentials, and tissue necrosis, which was restricted to the irradiated side. These doses also resulted in ipsilateral up-regulation of calbindin and HSP-72. Parvalbumin was down-regulated at 130 CGE. The 30 and 60 CGE animals displayed a marked increase in HSP-72 staining on the irradiated side but no demonstrable cell loss. No asymmetries were noted in somatostatin, calretinin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase staining. Normal physiology was found in rats receiving up to 60 CGE.CONCLUSION: This study expands our understanding of the effects of radiosurgery on the mammalian brain. Three months after PBR, the irradiated rat hippocampus demonstrates necrosis at 90 CGE, but not at 60 CGE, with associated abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging, physiology, and memory testing.

Structural models of gray matter, white matter, CSF, skull, and scalp were extracted from pre-surgical MR and post-surgical CT images. The electromagnetic source localization forward problem was solved using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). Source localization was performed using the Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) algorithm. The multiscale patch-basis source space constructed for this purpose includes a large number of dipole elements on the cortical layer oriented perpendicular to the local cortical surface. These source dipoles are combined into overlapping multi-scalepatches. Using this approach, we were able to detect seizure activity on sulcal walls and on gyrus of the cortex.",Excluded

This current was isolated in amacrine cells of the goldfish retinal slice preparations by the whole-cell patch clamp technique. The activation threshold of the persistent current was about -50 mV, approximately 10 mV more positive than the membrane potential in the dark.

1786,"Transmission of signals between irradiated and non-irradiated organisms: Mechanisms and significance Inter-animal signaling from irradiated to non-irradiated organisms has been demonstrated for whole body irradiated mice and also for fish. Endpoints studied include clastogenic damage, and reproductive cell death. For fish, proteomic data has also been produced showing the induction of a protective proteome in both medaka and rainbow trout. The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of medical microbeam irradiation using the ESRF synchrotron at Grenoble to the right brain hemisphere of the rat to determine whether abscopal effects could be produced in the rest of the animal and also in cage mates housed with it. The results show strong signal production in the contralateral brain hemisphere with less strong effects in the distant bladder of the irradiated rats. Signal strength was the same or stronger in the cage mates housed for 48 hrs with the irradiated rats. The proteomic study showed that the abscopal-associated proteins included A. an increase in the expression of NADH dehydrogenase, aconitase, ubiquinone and Glial fibrillary acid proteins, which are known to be present in gliomas, B. a reduction of the Prohibitin protein, which is thought to be a tumor suppressor in humans C. an increase on the expression of Heat shock cognate 71kDa protein, which is known to be involved in the disassembly of clarithin-coated vesicles and D. a decrease in the expression of Tubulin alpha-1A chain protein, which is known to be one of the major components of microtubules. All of these proteins would suggest a pro-carcinogenesis proteome. However in the cage mates, tubulin and aconitase were present but in different isoforms, HSP 71 was also induced. Significantly, pyruvate kinase, fructose biphosphate and aldolase were also present, suggesting mobilization of energy reserves. This also happened in the bystander fish. One brain specific protein which was suppressed in the cage mate brain is dihydropyrimidinase. This protein is prone to oxidation and the oxidised molecule is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A reduction could be seen as beneficial in terms of reducing the overall extent of oxidased dihydropyrimidinase. On the other hand dihydropyrimidinase is a vital neurotransmitter so a reduction could also be seen as detrimental to cognitive brain function. Whatever way the induced changes in the cage mates influence the health of the animals, it is very clear that proximity to an irradiated animal induces proteomic changes in an unirradiated partner. The transmitting agent in fish and rats is thought to be urine. If similar signaling occurs between humans, the results could have implications for caregivers and hospital staff treating radiotherapy patients.",Included

After intravenous injection of <sup>11</sup>C-ORM-13070, blood samples were drawn over 60 min. Plasma samples were analysed by radio-HPLC for intact tracer and its radioactive metabolites. Metabolite-corrected plasma time-activity curves were used for calculation of pharmacokinetics. In a separate group of 12 healthy men, the whole-body distribution of <sup>11</sup>C-ORM-13070 and radiation exposure were investigated by dynamic PET/CT imaging without blood sampling. Purpose: <sup>11</sup>C-labelled 1-[(S)-1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,2]dioxin-2-yl)methyl]-4-(3-methoxy-methylpyridin-2-yl)-piperazine (<sup>11</sup>C-ORM-13070) is a novel PET tracer for imaging of alpha<inf>2C</inf>-adrenoceptors in the human brain.

522,"A novel high-resolution in vivo imaging technique to study the dynamic response of intracranial structures to tumor growth and therapeutics We have successfully integrated previously established Intracranial window (ICW) technology (1-4) with intravital 2-photon confocal microscopy to develop a novel platform that allows for direct long-term visualization of tissue structure changes intracranially. Imaging at a single cell resolution in a real-time fashion provides supplementary dynamic information beyond that provided by standard end-point histological analysis, which looks solely at 'snap-shot' cross sections of tissue. Establishing this intravital imaging technique in fluorescent chimeric mice, we are able to image four fluorescent channels simultaneously. By incorporating fluorescently labeled cells, such as GFP+ bone marrow, it is possible to track the fate of these cells studying their long-term migration, integration and differentiation within tissue. Further integration of a secondary reporter cell, such as an mCherry glioma tumor line, allows for characterization of cell:cell interactions. Structural changes in the tissue microenvironment can be highlighted through the addition of intra-vital dyes and antibodies, for example CD31 tagged antibodies and Dextran molecules. Moreover, we describe the combination of our ICW imaging model with a small animal micro-irradiator that provides stereotactic irradiation, creating a platform through which the dynamic tissue changes that occur following the administration of ionizing irradiation can be assessed. Current limitations of our model include penetrance of the microscope, which is limited to a depth of up to 900 mum from the sub cortical surface, limiting imaging to the dorsal axis of the brain.

Basic descriptive, multivariable and artificial neuronal network analyses (ANN) were used to design predicting models influencing outcomes.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the study populations were similar. Patients undergoing LRH experienced lower blood loss (200 (range, 10-700) vs. 400 (range, 100-2000) ml; P < 0.001), shorter length of hospital stay (4 (range, 1-10) vs. 8 (range, 5-52) days; P < 0.001) and similar operative time (235 (+/- 67.3) vs. 258 (+/- 70.2) min; P = 0.14) than patients undergoing RAH.

3255,"Role of short TE 1H-MR spectroscopy in monitoring of post-operation irradiated patients Post-surgical radiation therapy is a routine procedure in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors. Along with modest therapeutic effects conventional fractionated radiotherapy, in spite of any modifications, produces damage to non-malignant brain tissues lying within the treatment volume, the extent of which depends on radiation dose. Serial 1H-MRS allows non-invasive investigation of tissue metabolic profiles. In the present study the ratios of resonance signals assigned to the major 1H-MRS-visible metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, inositol, lactate and lipid methylene group) were evaluated before, during and after post-surgical fractionated radiotherapy in brain regions close to and more distant from the tumor bed, receiving different radiation exposures (60 and < 40 Gy, respectively). The study group consisted of ten patients (aged 28-51). A MRI/MRS system (Elscint 2T Prestige) operating at the field strength of 2 T and the proton resonance frequency of 81.3 MHz has been used and the 1H-MR spectra were acquired using single voxel double-spin-echo PRESS sequence with a short TE. The spectra were post-processed with automatic fitting in the frequency domain. It was found that although the metabolite profiles depend on the dose obtained, but other stress factors (like surgery) seem to contribute to the overall picture of the metabolic status of the brain as well. In studies of early irradiation injuries, an increase of choline related ratios may serve rather as cell proliferation indictors than as cell injury ones, whereas the mI/Cr ratio appears as one of the first indicators of local irradiation injury. In order to establish the prognostic marker for early radiation damage, however, it seems necessary to analyze all visible metabolites as well. None of the metabolites separately may serve as such an indicator due to the complexity of tissue metabolism. Interestingly, MRI reveals no changes during the therapy process, whereas the metabolite ratios are being affected in the course of time, thus supporting the presumption that the 1H-MRS is a valuable method of radiation therapy monitoring.",Excluded

The system was then configured with extra image noise reduction algorithms and system settings, which enabled radiation dose reduction without loss of image quality. Radiation dose data from 174 neuroangiographies and 138 interventional neuroprocedures were collected for the period January-June 2012. Procedures were classified as diagnostic or interventional. Patient radiation exposure was quantified using cumulative dose area product and cumulative air kerma. Impact on working habits of the physician was quantified using fluoroscopy time and number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images.RESULTS: The optimized system settings provided significant reduction in dose indicators versus reference system settings (p<0.001): from 124 to 47 Gy cm(2) and from 0.78 to 0.27 Gy for neuroangiography, and from 328 to 109 Gy cm(2) and from 2.71 to 0.89 Gy for interventional neuroradiology.

3561,"Risk factors of brain metastases as initial failure for completely resected stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer Purpose/Objective(s): Brain metastasis (BM) is the main sign of failure of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The lymph node (LN) status is a major determinant of outcome in patients with NSCLC, but whether or not the LN status is a major determinant of BM remains unclear. In the present study, we focused on completely resected staged IIIA (N2) LA-NSCLC to explore the correlation between LN status and BM. We also aimed to identify the risk factors of BM as the initial site of failure, as well as the potential highest-risk candidates who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Materials/Methods: The medical records of 357 consecutive patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who underwent complete surgery were reviewed between January 2005 and June 2012. Time to BM as the initial site of failure was measured from the date of surgery to the date of BM in the patients who developed distant metastases or both local and distant recurrence as the initial failure, with BM defined as an event. The cumulative incidence of BM as the initial site of failure and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. To assess the risk factors of BM, the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis, and Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis. Result(s): A total of 73 (20.4%) patients developed BM, and 60 patients had BM as their initial site of failure.

Univariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.000), positive extra-capsular extension of LN metastasis (P=0.041), number of metastatic LN > 4 (P = 0.018), multiple N2 stations (P = 0.027), and multiple regions of mediastinal LN (MLN) involvement (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing BM as the initial site of failure. Multivariate analysis showed that non-squamous cell cancer (P = 0.002; HR = 5.148; 95% CI = 1.863-14.222) and multiple regions of MLN involvement (P = 0.015; HR = 0.556; 95% CI = 0.326-0.948) were significantly associated with the high risk of BM as the initial site of failure. In patients with nonsquamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement, the fiveyear actuarial risk of BM as the initial failure was 47.6%. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement were independent risk factors for BM as the initial failure in completely resected IIIA (N2) NSCLC. Patients with non-squamous cell cancer and multiple regions of MLN involvement are at the highest risk of developing BM as the initial failure, and may receive a greater benefit from PCI.

2688,"PET/CT in the Evaluation of Neuroblastoma I-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is the most commonly used functional imaging agent in patients with neuroblastoma, but use of [F-18]- FDG PET is increasing. MIBG is useful for defining the extent of disease at diagnosis, following response to treatment, and localizing residual and recurrent disease. In early-stage disease, FDG is often better concentrated in tumor sites than MIBG. In all stages, disease extent in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and local metastases may be better delineated by FDG. In advanced-stage disease, MIBG is superior for following the treatment response of metastatic tumor in the marrow and bone. Several C-11- and F-18-labeled tracers may be equal to or superior to I-123-MIBG if supply problems can be resolved. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

In eight patients with primary dystonia who were treated with bilateral chronic pallidal stimulation, we correlated symptom-related electromyogram (EMG) activity of the most affected muscles with the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the globus pallidus electrodes. In 5 dystonic patients with mobile involuntary movements, rhythmic EMG bursts in the contralateral muscles were coherent with the oscillations in the pallidal LFPs at the burst frequency. In contrast, no significant coherence was seen between EMG and LFPs either for the sustained activity separated out from the compound EMGs in those 5 cases, or in the EMGs in 3 other cases without mobile involuntary movements and rhythmic EMG bursts. In comparison with the resting condition, in both active and passive movements, significant modulation in the GPi LFPs was seen in the range of 8-16 Hz. The finding of significant coherence between GPi oscillations and rhythmic EMG bursts but not sustained tonic EMG activity suggests that the synchronized pallidal activity may be directly related to the rhythmic involuntary movements. In contrast, the sustained hypertonic muscle activity may be represented by less synchronized activity in the pallidum. Thus, the pallidum may play different roles in generating different components of the dystonic symptom complex.",Excluded

2775,"Revolution in Radiation In the past few decades, there have been many changes in the field of radiotherapy. These include better imaging, better motion management, improvements in treatment planning, better position verification and more precise treatment delivery. This has led to an increased use of radiotherapy and to significant improvements in clinical outcome. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT, aka SABR) is currently the standard of care for patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC. The technique is now safely used for more centrally located, larger and multiple lesions as well. SBRT is increasingly being considered as an alternative to surgery in operable patients. The results of two randomized clinical trials which were closed prematurely due to poor accrual, suggest equivalence between SBRT and surgery. Comparative effectiveness studies point in the same direction. New randomized trials on this topic are currently recruiting. In stage III NSCLC, radiotherapy can also be delivered with increased precision. Although the use of much higher dose has not (yet) led to better outcomes, the newer radiation techniques are associated with less toxicity and over the years, there has been a steady improvement in control and survival rates. The use of immunotherapy in combination with radiotherapy holds many promises. The role of proton therapy is still investigational. For patients with oligometastatic disease or oligoprogression, local treatments including radiotherapy can be highly effective and may lead to long term control and improvements in survival. We are awaiting the results of randomized studies to unequivocally show this benefit. In LS-SCLC, there is still discussion on the schemes for thoracic radiotherapy (BID or QD). The improvement in median survival in both arms of the recent CONVERT trial compared to earlier studies are probably exemplary for the general improvements in radiotherapy techniques. In ES-SCLC patients, thoracic radiotherapy is advocated for those patients with a response after chemotherapy but with residual disease in their chest. In ES-SCLC, prophylactic cranial irradiation is nowadays sometimes replaced with MRI-surveillance. Delayed cranial irradiation is than used in about two out of three patients. An important breakthrough in radiotherapy is the introduction of MRI guidance on the linear accelerator. This not only provides better soft-tissue imaging, but also for the first time, continuous imaging during the delivery of the treatment. The anatomical information from the MRI made daily with the patient on the treatment couch can be used to daily adapt the treatment plan. This allows for the use of smaller margins and early results demonstrate important benefits, especially in high-risk patients.

Patients were examined with (11)C-L-methionine PET and MRI prior to treatment and after 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. Temporal changes in methionine uptake ratio, meningioma volume, meningioma regrowth and clinical symptoms throughout the follow-up period were evaluated.RESULTS: In 17 patients the tumour volume was unchanged throughout the follow-up. The methionine uptake ratio on PET decreased over the years in most patients. In two patients the tumour remnant showed progression on MRI. In these patients, prior to the volume increase on MRI, the methionine uptake ratio increased. One patient experienced transient clinical symptoms and showed radiological evidence of a radiation-induced reaction close to the irradiated field.CONCLUSION: Proton beam treatment is a safe and effective treatment for achieving long-term growth arrest in meningioma remnants.

Twenty-seven strains from patients who were previously diagnosed to have ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) were positive for this feature. Among the cell strains that did not show RDS were two from AT obligate heterozygotes (i.e., the parents of AT patients), two from patients with Alzheimer disease, two from patients with Friedreich ataxia, one from a patient with Bloom syndrome, one from a patient with Down syndrome, and six from patients with various immunodeficiencies. Four strains demonstrated RDS that was less pronounced than in most AT cells: one was from a patient with Nijmegen breakage syndrome, one was from a patient without ataxia but with choreiform movement disorder, telangiectasia, and elevated concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood, and two were from AT patients.

The index date was the first date of metastasis diagnosis. Patients were followed from the index date to death, disenrollment, or end of the study period (6/30/2010), whichever occurred first. Surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies were examined descriptively. Factors influencing treatment were examined using a logistic regression separately for surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy. RESULT(S): A total of 2546 patients with metastatic melanoma were included in the analyses. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 60.6 (+/- 14.0) years old with 22.8% under 50 and 36.5% were female. Overall, 66.8% of patients had cancer treatment related surgery, 38.7% received systemic therapies, 44.7% received radiation, and 17.7% of patients received all three treatments. Logistic regressions revealed that patients with lung (p <0.0001), brain (p <0.0001), liver (p <0.0001), or bone (p <0.0001) metastases were less likely to have surgeries; patients with lung (p = 0.04), brain (p < 0.001), or liver metastases (p = 0.03) were more likely to receive systemic therapies; as expected patients with brain (p < 0.0001) or bone metastases (p < 0.0001) were more likely to have radiation therapy. Patients being treated by oncologists were more likely to receive systemic therapy (p < 0.0001) or radiation (p < 0.0001) while patients being treated by dermatologists were more likely to receive surgery subsequently (p = 0.002). Older age and female gender were associated with a lower likelihood to receive surgery, systemic, or radiation therapy.

Blue light induces photoreceptor apoptosis and causes age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. In the present study, we investigated the roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by blue light-emitting diode (LED) light exposure in murine photoreceptor cells.METHODS: The murine photoreceptor cell line was incubated and exposed to blue LED light (464 nm blue LED light, 450 lx, 3 to 24 h). The expression of the factors involved in the unfolded protein response pathway was examined using quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblot analysis. The aggregation of short-wavelength opsin (S-opsin) in the murine photoreceptor cells was observed with immunostaining. The effect of S-opsin knockdown on ATF4 expression in the murine photoreceptor cell line was also investigated.RESULTS: Exposure to blue LED light increased the bip, atf4, and grp94 mRNA levels, induced the expression of ATF4 protein, and increased the levels of ubiquitinated proteins. Exposure to blue LED light in combination with ER stress inducers (tunicamycin and dithiothreitol) induced the aggregation of S-opsin. S-opsin mRNA knockdown prevented the induction of ATF4 expression in response to exposure to blue LED light.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the aggregation of S-opsin induced by exposure to blue LED light causes ER stress, and ATF4 activation in particular.",Excluded

3011,"High dietary iron increases oxidative stress and radiosensitivity in the rat retina and vasculature after exposure to fractionated gamma radiation Radiation exposure in combination with other space environmental factors including microgravity, nutritional status, and deconditioning is a concern for long-duration space exploration missions. Astronauts experience altered iron homeostasis due to adaptations to microgravity and an iron-rich food system. Iron intake reaches three to six times the recommended daily allowance due to the use of fortified foods on the International Space Station. Iron is associated with certain optic neuropathies and can potentiate oxidative stress. This study examined the response of eye and vascular tissue to gamma radiation exposure (3 Gy fractionated at 37.5 cGy per day every other day for 8 fractions) in rats fed an adequate-iron diet or a high-iron diet. Twelve-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four experimental groups: adequate-iron diet/no radiation (CON), high-iron diet/no radiation (IRON), adequate-iron diet/radiation (RAD), and high-iron diet/radiation (IRON+RAD). Animals were maintained on the corresponding iron diet for 2 weeks before radiation exposure. As previously published, the high-iron diet resulted in elevated blood and liver iron levels. Dietary iron overload altered the radiation response observed in serum analytes, as evidenced by a significant increase in catalase levels and smaller decrease in glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity levels. 8-OHdG immunostaining, showed increased intensity in the retina after radiation exposure. Gene expression profiles of retinal and aortic vascular samples suggested an interaction between the response to radiation and high dietary iron.

Another age-matched 115 patients who had no radiotherapy but symptomatic high-grade (>70%) carotid stenoses were enrolled as referent subjects. Digital subtraction angiography was performed within 2 months from stroke onset and delineated carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations from aortic arch up to intracranial branches. Two reviewers blinded to group assignment recorded all vascular lesions, collateral status, and infarct pattern.RESULTS: ORV patients had less atherosclerotic risk factors at presentation. In referent patients, high-grade stenoses were mostly focal at the proximal internal carotid artery. In contrast, high-grade ORV lesions diffusely involved the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery and were more frequently bilateral (54% versus 22%), tandem (23% versus 10%), associated with complete occlusion in one or both carotid arteries (30% versus 9%), vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusions (28% versus 16%), and external carotid artery stenosis (19% versus 5%) (all P<0.05). With comparable rates of vascular anomaly, ORV patients showed more established collateral circulations through leptomeningeal arteries, anterior communicating artery, posterior communicating artery, suboccipital/costocervical artery, and retrograde flow in ophthalmic artery. In terms of infarct topography, the frequencies of cortical or subcortical watershed infarcts were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: ORV angiographic features and corresponding collaterals are distinct from atherosclerotic patterns at initial stroke presentation.

3570,"Performance of long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detectors PURPOSE: High-sensitivity and high-resolution depth-encoding positron emission tomography (PET) detectors are required to simultaneously improve the sensitivity and spatial resolution of a PET scanner so that the quantitative accuracy of PET studies can be improved. The semi-monolithic scintillator PET detector has the advantage of measuring the depth of interaction with single-ended readout as compared to the traditional pixelated scintillator detector, and significantly reducing the edge effect that deteriorates the spatial resolution at edges of the detector as compared to the monolithic scintillator detector if a long rectangular semi-monolithic detector is used. In this work, depth-encoding PET detector modules were built by using long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillators and single-ended readout by silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays. The performance of the detector modules was measured.METHODS: The rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator detector has an outside dimension of 11.6 x 37.6 x 10 mm<sup>3</sup> and consists of 11 polished lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) slices measuring 1 x 37.6 x 10 mm<sup>3</sup> . The enhanced specular reflector (ESR) was glued on both cross-sectional surfaces of each crystal slice. For the face opposite to the SiPM array and the two end faces of the detectors, surface treatments with and without black paint were implemented for performance comparison. The bottom face of the semi-monolithic detector was coupled to a 4 x 12 SiPM array that was grouped along rows and columns separately into 16 signals. The four row signals were used to identify the slices, and the 12 column signals were used to estimate the y (monolithic direction) and z (depth direction) interaction positions. The detector was irradiated at multiple positions with a collimated 511 keV gamma beam. The collimated beam was obtained with electronic collimation by using a <sup>22</sup> Na point source and a reference detector. The estimated width of the gamma beam is around 0.5 mm. The flood histogram for crystal slices was measured by using the center of gravity (COG) method. The COG method and the squared COG method were used for y position estimation. The standard deviation of the column signals, the ratio of maximum to the sum of the column signals, and the sum of squared column signals were used for z position estimation.RESULTS: All slices were clearly resolved from the measured flood histograms for both detectors with different crystal surface treatments. The estimated y positions roughly linearly change with the true positions at the middle of the detector until ~5 mm from both ends of the detector. The y and z spatial resolutions of the detectors were estimated for all middle positions located more than 5 mm from both ends of the detector. The squared COG method provides better y position resolution than the COG method. The three z estimation methods provide similar depth of interaction (DOI) resolution. Surface treatment with black paint significantly improves both y and z position resolution but degrades the energy and timing resolution of the detectors. The average full width half maxima (FWHM) spatial resolution is improved from 1.77 to 1.07 mm in the y direction by using the squared COG method and from 2.71 to 1.55 mm in the z direction by using the standard deviation method. The slice-based average energy resolution degrades from 15.8% to 24.9%. The timing resolution of the entire detector module degrades from 596 to 788 ps.CONCLUSION: The performance of rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator PET detectors with two different crystal surface treatments was measured. The detectors provide superior spatial resolution and depth-encoding capability and can be used to develop small animal and dedicated breast and brain PET scanners that can simultaneously achieve high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and low cost.",Excluded
216,"Multiwavelength optical intrinsic signal imaging of cortical spreading depression Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is an important disease model for migraine and cerebral ischemia. In this study, we exploit the high temporal and spatial resolution of optical imaging to characterize perfusion-dependent and -independent changes in response to CSD and to investigate the etiology of reflectance changes during CSD. In this experiment, we characterized the optical response to CSD at wavelengths that emphasize perfusion-related changes (610 and 550 nm), and we compared these results with 850 nm and blood volume data. Blood volume changes during CSD were recorded using an intravascular fluorescent dye, Texas Red dextran. We observed triphasic optical signals at 850 and 550 nm characterized by spreading waves of increased, decreased, then increased reflectance (Fig. 1) which expanded at a rate of approximately 3-5 mm/min. The signal at 610 nm had a similar initial phase, but the phase 2 response was slightly more complex, with a parenchymal decrease in reflectance but a vascular increase in reflectance. Reflectance values decreased in phase three. Blood volume signals were delayed relative to the optical intrinsic signals and corresponded temporally to phases 2 and 3. This is the first study to characterize optical imaging of intrinsic signal responses to CSD, in vivo, at multiple wavelengths. The data presented here suggest that changes in light scattering precede perfusion responses, the blood volume increase (phase 2) is accompanied by a reduction in deoxyhemoglobin, and the blood volume decrease (phase 3) is accompanied by an increase in deoxyhemoglobin. Previous studies have suggested the oligemia of spreading depression was a result of decreased metabolic demand.

There was no observed correlation between the response patterns in the three regions. The technique provides a tool with which to identify and classify the specific response patterns induced by morphine in specific brain regions, and the results may indicate that each region plays a different physiological role in the effects induced by morphine.",Excluded
2889,"Targeting of externalized alphaB-crystallin on irradiated endothelial cells with pro-thrombotic vascular targeting agents: Potential applications for brain arteriovenous malformations BACKGROUND: Vascular targeting uses molecular markers on the surface of diseased vasculature for ligand-directed drug delivery to induce vessel occlusion or destruction. In the absence of discriminatory markers, such as in brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), stereotactic radiosurgery may be used to prime molecular changes on the endothelial surface. This study explored alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) as a radiation induced target and pre-tested the specificity and efficacy of a CRYAB-targeting coaguligand for in vitro thrombus induction.METHODS: A parallel-plate flow system was established to circulate human whole blood over a layer of human brain endothelial cells. A conjugate of anti-CRYAB antibody and thrombin was injected into the circuit to compare binding and thrombus formation on cells with or without prior radiation treatment (0-25 Gy).RESULTS: Radiation increased CRYAB expression and surface exposure in human brain endothelial cells. In the parallel-plate flow system, the targeted anti-CRYAB-thrombin conjugate increased thrombus formation on the surface of irradiated cells relative to non-irradiated cells and to a non-targeting IgG-thrombin conjugate. Fibrin deposition and accumulation of fibrinogen degradation products increased significantly at radiation doses at or above 15 Gy with conjugate concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 mug/mL.CONCLUSIONS: CRYAB exposure can be detected at the surface of human brain endothelial cells in response to irradiation. Pro-thrombotic CRYAB-targeting conjugates can bind under high flow conditions and in the presence of whole blood induce stable thrombus formation with high specificity and efficacy on irradiated surfaces.

Should they be enucleated, or is ocular preservation just as good in terms of survival?METHODS: We performed a retrospective survival analysis of secondary enucleation versus ocular preservation in patients with a posterior uveal melanoma treated by plaque radiotherapy whose irradiated eye became completely blind following that treatment. Of the 79 patients who fulfilled defined inclusion criteria, 25 underwent secondary enucleation of the blind eye, and 54 retained their irradiated blind eye.RESULTS: Most of the baseline demographic and tumour-related variables evaluated were similarly distributed between the subgroups. The 5-year, 10-year and 15-year all-cause death rates in the secondary enucleation subgroup were 24.7%, 51.5% and 52.0% respectively, and those in the ocular preservation subgroup were 7.4%, 32.9% and 48.1% respectively. In spite of the apparent slight difference between the curves, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.41, Mantel-Haenszel test).INTERPRETATION: Although a retrospective study of this type has several limitations, our results suggest that secondary enucleation is not likely to substantially improve survival of patients whose irradiated eye becomes totally blind following plaque radiotherapy for choroidal or ciliochoroidal melanoma.",Excluded
1590,"Microinjection of morphine into various amygdaloid nuclei differentially affects nociceptive responsiveness and RVM neuronal activity The goal of the present study was to identify nuclei of the amygdala in which opioid-sensitive systems can act to recruit nociceptive modulatory circuitry in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and affect nociceptive responsiveness. In lightly anesthetized rats, 10 microg of morphine was bilaterally microinjected into basolateral, cortical, medial, central, and lateral nuclei of the amygdala to determine the relative influence on the activity of identified ON, OFF and NEUTRAL cells in the RVM and on the latency of the tail flick reflex evoked by noxious radiant heat. Infusions of morphine into the basolateral nuclei resulted in a substantial, naloxone-reversible increase in tail flick latency, and significantly increased ongoing firing of OFF cells and depressed that of ON cells. The reflex-related changes in cell firing were also attenuated. Morphine infusions into the cortical nuclei resulted in a small (approximately 1 s) but significant increase in tail flick latency. As with basolateral microinjections, ongoing activity of the OFF cells was increased, and although the ongoing firing of ON cells was not significantly changed, the reflex-related burst that characterizes these neurons was reduced. Microinjections in the medial nuclei again altered ongoing activity of both ON cells and OFF cells. However, the duration of the OFF cell pause and tail flick latency were unchanged. NEUTRAL cells were not affected by morphine at any site. Morphine applied within the central, medial lateral and dorsal lateral nuclei had no effect on RVM neurons or on the tail flick. Thus, focal application of morphine within the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala produced hypoalgesia and influenced RVM ON and OFF cells in a manner similar to that seen following systemic or RVM opioid administration. Opioid action within the medial and cortical nuclei also influenced RVM cell activity, but did not prevent the reflex-related OFF cell pause, and failed to alter the tail flick substantially. These observations, plus the lack of an opioid-activated influence from the central and lateral nuclei, demonstrate fundamental differences among systems linking the different amygdalar nuclei with the RVM. One way in which the modulatory circuitry of the RVM might be engaged physiologically in behaving animals is via opioid-mediated activation of the basolateral nucleus.",Excluded
2922,"A case of multi-organ langerhans cell histiocytosis responsive to tobacco cessation Background Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) may present with single or multi-organ involvement (lung, bone, pituitary gland, skin, lymph). Pulmonary LCH is nearly always associated with smoking and lesions may regress with tobacco cessation, which is considered the initial focus of therapy. Multi-organ LCH is thought to be more aggressive and treatment frequently requires systemic chemotherapy, radiation, or combination therapy. The following case illustrates a patient with multi-organ LCH presenting as a pathologic fracture, and describes simultaneous regression of both lung and bone lesions coinciding with tobacco cessation. Case A 32 year-old female with longstanding tobacco abuse, extensive tuberculosis exposure, prior residence in the California high desert, and family history of BRCA mutation presented following a low-impact fall with T4 vertebral pathologic fracture on MRI. She reported subjective fevers, dyspnea on exertion, and intermittent chest pain for two months prior. Exam was notable for tenderness to palpation over T4 and a papular facial rash. Basic laboratory evaluation was normal, but CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed: innumerable subcentimeter middle/upper lobe-predominant pulmonary nodules, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, ovary with two centimeter cystic structure, and the lytic T4 lesion. Broad differential diagnosis included malignancy, tuberculosis, disseminated fungal disease, and granulomatous disease. Technetium bone scan only revealed the isolated vertebral lesion. PPD and AFB blood cultures were negative. Lumbar puncture and breast/brain MRIs were unrevealing. Coccidiomycosis antibodies, tumor markers, ANA, HIV, hepatitis serologies, SPEP/UPEP, serum quantitative immunoglobulins, and ACE levels were all unremarkable. T4 lesion biopsy was initially thought risky due to aorta proximity, thus bronchoscopy was performed; lavage and transbronchial biopsies were non-diagnostic. Ensuing VATS biopsy specimen revealed bronchiole histiocyte aggregates, eosinophils, and positive CD1a/S100 stains (pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis). While follow-up outpatient vertebral biopsy did not confirm LCH bony involvement, disseminated LCH was assumed given her pathologic fracture. Radiation of the vertebral lesion was considered, but deferred when tobacco cessation over 1.5 years led to near-resolution of pulmonary nodules, regression of vertebral lesion, and diminished symptoms. The patient then began smoking again with subsequent recurrent pulmonary involvement, and a new humeral fracture with biopsy-proven LCH of the bone. Discussion This unique case of LCH demonstrates remission and relapse of multi-organ involvement, correlating temporally with cessation of and subsequent return to tobacco use. This is interesting given that unlike isolated pulmonary disease, the causative role of tobacco and response to smoking avoidance have not been previously described for multi-organ LCH.",Excluded
516,"Physiological changes in glucose differentially modulate the excitability of hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone and orexin neurons in situ The physiological signaling mechanisms that link normal variations in body energy status to the activity of arousal- and metabolism-regulating brain centers are not well understood. The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin/hypocretin types of neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) exert opposing effects on arousal and metabolism. We examined whether shifts in brain extracellular glucose that correspond to physiological changes in blood glucose can alter the electrical output of neurochemically and biophysically defined LH cells in mouse brain slices. Here, we show that physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose dose-dependently enhance the electrical excitability of MCH neurons by inducing depolarization and increasing membrane resistance. We also demonstrate that the same physiological shifts in glucose have the opposite effects on the electrical activity of orexin neurons. We propose that these direct actions of glucose on the arousal- and metabolism-regulating LH neurons play a key role in the translation of normal variations in body energy resources into appropriate changes in arousal and metabolism.",Excluded

Influence of decimetric microwave irradiation (460 MHz) on free radical processes in the rat brain tissues--visual cortex and hypothalamus--were investigated. Oxidative effects of both lipid peroxidation and specific activity of glutathione reductase were determined. It is shown that whole body irradiation for up to 4 weeks results in considerable changes of the above indices dependent on the irradiation intensity and age of the animals. Decimetric microwaves have oxidant effects at high intensity irradiation (SAR--15 mW/kg), while these effects are antioxidant at low intensity (SAR--5 mW/kg). Physiological implications of different oxidative metabolic responses of the hypothalamus and the cortex to microwaves irradiation are discussed.",Excluded
2901,"Subthalamic nucleus stimulation for primary dystonia and tardive dystonia With the renaissance of stereotactic pallidotomy for Parkinson's disease in 1990s, pallidotomy has become increasingly used as an effective treatment for various manifestations of medically refractory dystonia. More recently, deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been replacing pallidotomy. Although GPi DBS has great promise for treating dystonia, there are some disadvantages. We introduce our experiences in subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS for primary dystonia and tardive dystonia in this chapter. We propose that STN DBS has the following advantages over GPi DBS: (1) symptomatic improvement is seen immediately after stimulation, allowing us to quickly select the most suitable stimulation parameters; (2) the stimulation parameters for the STN are lower than those used for the GPi, resulting in longer battery life; and (3) STN DBS results in better symptomatic control than GPi DBS in dystonia patients when our STN data is compared to that obtained by others with using the GPi as the target. We suggest that STN DBS may be the most appropriate surgical technique for dystonia. [References: 50]",Excluded

1950,"Application of PINS radiofrequency pulses to reduce power deposition in RARE/turbo spin echo imaging of the human head Purpose To explore the use of PINS radiofrequency (RF) pulses to reduce RF power deposition in multiband/simultaneous multislice imaging with the RARE/turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence at 3T and 7T. Methods A PINS-TSE sequence was implemented and combined with blipped CAIPI to improve the reconstruction of superposed slices. Whole brain imaging of healthy volunteers was performed at both 3T and 7T using a 32-channel coil for signal reception. Results A considerable reduction in power deposition was achieved compared with a standard sequence of the manufacturer. At 3T, the reduction in specific absorption rate (SAR) made short pulse repetition times (TRs) possible, however, in order to obtain a good T2 contrast, it is advisable to maintain TR while extending the echo train length. At 7T, whole brain coverage with a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 x 2 mm<sup>3</sup> was achieved in an acquisition time of 150 s. Furthermore, it could be shown that pulse sequences that use PINS pulses do not suffer from having additional magnetization transfer contrast. Conclusion PINS RF pulses combined with multiband imaging reduce SAR sufficiently to enable routine TSE imaging at 7T within clinically acceptable acquisition times. In general, the combination of multiband imaging with PINS RF pulses represents a method to reduce total RF power deposition. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Hyperthermia for 30 min at a spinal cord temperature of 41.1, 42.3, and 42.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C was applied 5 to 10 min after irradiation by means of a 434 MHz microwave applicator. Animals were observed for 21 months while recording myelopathy and development of tumors.RESULTS: The latent period for hind leg paralysis decreased with increasing radiation dose from 359 +/- 31 days (n = 9) after 20 Gy to 200 +/- 4 days (n = 5) after 32 Gy. Hyperthermia enhanced the radiation response of the lumbosacral spinal cord as evidenced by shortening of the latent period for paralysis and a decrease in the biological effective dose. After 20 Gy followed by 30 min 41.1 degrees C, latency was diminished to 214 +/- 16 days (n = 7, p < 0.001 vs. 20 Gy alone). The ED50 was 21.1 Gy, which was diminished to values between 16 and 17 Gy if radiation was followed by hyperthermia, giving a thermal enhancement ratio between 1.24 and 1.32. Histopathological examination of the spinal cord after combined treatment of x-rays and hyperthermia showed necrosis of nerve roots. Irradiation with 16, 20, 24, and 28 Gy (n = 77) alone led to tumor induction in 17 +/- 8% of the animals (pooled data). If followed by hyperthermia (n = 96), it was increased to 33 +/- 12% (p < 0.01). Most tumors induced by radiation and hyperthermia were sarcomas.CONCLUSION: First, the radiation response of rat lumbosacral spinal cord was enhanced by heat. Second, latency for paralysis was shortened in the lower dose range. Third, no difference in pathology between x-rays alone or in combination with hyperthermia.

3204,"Head and neck tumor cell radiation response occurs in the presence of IGF1 Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer results in severe secondary side-effects in salivary glands. We previously demonstrated that the administration of IGF1 preserves or restores salivary gland function following radiation. Based on these findings, we propose to study the effect of IGF1 on human head and neck carcinoma cells. Head and neck tumor cells treated with radiation have significant reductions in tumor cell survival, as measured by MTT and crystal violet assays, regardless of IGF1 pre-treatment. Head and neck squamous carcinoma cell xenografts treated with concurrent radiation+IGF1 also exhibit significant tumor growth delay; however, growth rates are elevated compared with those in irradiated xenografts. In contrast, administration of IGF1 after radiation treatment has no effect on tumor xenograft growth rates. Analysis of these data suggests that localized delivery may be required for concurrent therapy to prevent secondary side-effects of radiotherapy, while post-therapy administration of IGF1 could be considered for the restoration of salivary function.",Excluded
2607,"Motion sickness: Part III. A clinical study based on surgery of posterior fossa tumors Three patients who had large, benign cerebellar tumors were operated upon in the sitting position and developed symptoms referable to the temporoparieto-occipital region of the brain 24-48 h postoperatively. They consisted of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, formed and unformed hallucinations, and inversion of image or disorientation in space, some of which were experienced by some of the astronauts and cosmonauts during space flight. Such findings are not due to stimulation of the cerebellum, the site of the lesion, but must come from the cerebral hemisphere. The symptoms were believed to be caused by 'the luxury perfusion' of Lassen with the development of local lactic acidosis secondary to vascular insufficiency to the brain in the distribution of the posterior cerebral artery thus stimulating the temporoparieto-occipital region. This theory is suggested to some degree by the work of Endo et al. using CT scans, which showed the shifting of increased blood flow from the frontal region to the temporoparieto-occipital region following removal of a benign posterior fossa tumor. The mechanism for the compression of the posterior cerebral artery may be due to uncal herniation at the tentorium. The authors believe that it might be well to consider further testing in a vertical or oblique plane rather than only in a centrifugal horizontal one. This method would tend to cause uncal herniation more readily. Monitoring of such effects could be done with the colored CT scan.",Excluded

Contents of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma and IL-4 in serum were measured and changes of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoid (GC) in serum were analyzed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunologic assay, respectively at different time points post wound and radiation.RESULTS: (1) The level of IFN-gamma, one of the Th1 cell cytokines increased significantly at 14 d post CWR, which was markedly higher than that in control group and wound group. However, the level of IL-4, IL-1beta and IL-6, one of the Th2 cell cytokines, did not show obvious change. (2) Ratio of Th1/Th2 (IFN-gamma/IL-4) in wound group and CWR group increased significantly at 7 d after wound and radiation, which suggested that Th1/Th2 balance drifted to Th1 immune response. The ratio of Th1/Th2 in wound group returned to the normal level up to 14 d after the wound and radiation, while the Th1/Th2 ratio in CWR group increased persistently and was much higher than that in control and wound groups. (3) Level of serous ACTH and GC in CWR group increased at 3 d post wound and radiation, and among them, level of GC showed statistically significant increase, which was much higher than that in control and wound groups.CONCLUSION: Level of serous neurohormone GC in rats increased significantly immediately after wound and radiation; while the level of IFN-gamma showed significant increase only up to 14 d after wound and radiation, and the Th1/Th2 imbalance sustained till 28 d post wound and radiation. In order to reduce acute damage caused by CWR, organic immune system and nerve system showed up a marked regulate effects simultaneously and mutually. Nonetheless, the excessive stress induced by CWR causes disturbance of immunoregulation, which is one of the key reasons for delayed wound healing in CWR.",Included

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated data from 40 eligible patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Radiographic features of metastatic brain tumors, including the number, size, location, and peritumoral brain edema size (PBES), were delineated using MRI. Result(s): 13 patients had metachronous BM (MBM), having developed BM at least 6 months after diagnosis with NSCLC. The remaining patients were categorized as having synchronous BM (SBM). Compared with patients in the SBM group, patients in the MBM group were found to have more favorable values for radiological features including BM number, BM size, and PBES. Ten (76.9%) of the 13 patients with MBM had <=3 lesions and were asymptomatic, and none had developed a diffuse BM pattern, supporting the adoption of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the majority of these patients and against the administration of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Conversely, among the 27 patients with SBM, 15 (55.6%) patients had >3 lesions and 12 (44.4%) patients were symptomatic, highlighting the necessity of rapidly administrating brain radiotherapy, either as SRS or whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Importantly, only two patients (5.0%) had metastases in the hippocampus and peri-hippocampus region, and both were in the SBM group, indicating the feasibility of hippocampal avoidance WBRT in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Conclusion(s): Both WBRT and SRS are appropriate for the treatment of BM in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. The incidence of BM in the hippocampus and peri-hippocampus region is low in our radiological data. Nearly 80% of patients with metachronous BM have oligo-metastatic lesions, indicating that SRS is the preferred therapy while PCI is not indicated. Copyright © The author(s).",Excluded

In the present study, we investigated the use of low dosage re-treatment with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE (Lu-PRRT) in patients with GEP-NENs who relapsed after treatment with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTATOC (Y-PRRT). Method(s): Upon tumour progression, 26 patients with a PFS of at least 12 months after Y-PRRT were consecutively enrolled in a phase II study of re-treatment with Lu-PRRT. All patients had preserved kidney and haematological parameters and received 14.8 - 18.5 GBq of Lu-PRRT in four or five cycles. The disease control rate (DCR), toxicity, PFS and prognostic factors were evaluated. Result(s): Median total activity of Lu-PRRT was 16.5 GBq in five cycles. The DCR was 84.6 %, median PFS was 22 months (95 % CI 16 months - not reached) compared to 28 months (95 % CI 20 - 36 months) after Y-PRRT. Tumour burden and number of liver metastases were important prognostic factors. Toxicity was mild after Lu-PRRT re-treatment in the majority of patients, with only two patients with grade 2 and one with grade 3 bone marrow toxicity; one patient had grade 2 and one grade 3 renal toxicity. Conclusion(s): Patients with GEP-NEN who have previously responded to Y-PRRT are suitable candidates for Lu-PRRT re-treatment on progression. Although our sample size was limited, low-dosage Lu-PRRT was safe, and led to DCR and PFS rates comparable with those observed when Y-PRRT was used as primary treatment.

3600,"Establishment and Characteristic Analysis of a Dog Model for Autologous Homologous Cranioplasty Objective. The aim of this study is to establish a large animal (dog) model that can be referred clinically for autologous homologous cranioplasty. Methods. Our large skull defect dog model was established by emulating the decompressive craniectomy with 22 adult beagle dogs. The autologous bones were taken out from the dogs and divided into two groups, the freeze-drying (FD) group and the single freezing (SF) group. They were then stored in the bone bank at-20degreeC after being irradiated with 25 KGy. Three months later, the bones were reimplanted. After operation, we closely watch the experimental objects for four more months examining the infection and survival of the bone graft. Results. Through macroscopic observation, it was found that, among 44 cranial flaps (bilateral) from the rest of the 22 dogs, grade A cranial flaps accounted for 86.4% (19/22) in the SF group and only 31.8% (7/22) in the FD group. Although osteogenic osteoclast, Harvard tube, neovascularization, and angiogenic factors were found through the pathological results, including an electron microscope and calmodulin tracer, it could be verified by using X-CT and micro-CT that early bone resorption could be still found even in grade A bone flap. Conclusion. By using the common clinical method to preserve the cranial flaps, we established an experimental dog model of autologous cranioplasty for a large area of cranial defect. It was proved that this model could reproduce the infections and bone resorption which typically happened in clinical autologous homologous cranioplasty. As a conclusion, the established model can be used as an effective experimental tool for further research to improve the success rate of autologous homologous cranioplasty.

This selective protection is due to the greater conversion and uptake of the active metabolite, WR- 1065, in normal versus neoplastic tissues. In a pivotal phase III trial, 242 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were randomised to receive treatment with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with or without pretreatment with intravenous amifostine 910 mg/m2. Over 6 cycles of therapy, amifostine significantly reduced haematological, renal and neurological toxicities: treatment delays, treatment discontinuation and days in hospital related to these adverse events were also significantly reduced in patients receiving amifostine versus patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In another randomised phase III trial in 303 patients with head and neck cancer undergoing irradiation therapy (total dose 50 to 70Gy), pretreatment with intravenous amifostine 200 mg/m2 significantly reduced the incidence of acute and late grade > or =2 xerostomia. However, mucositis was not significantly reduced in amifostine recipients compared with patients receiving radiotherapy alone, although this has been shown in smaller randomised trials. Amifostine (340 mg/m2) also provided significant protection against pneumonitis and oesophagitis in patients with lung cancer receiving thoracic irradiation in a preliminary report from a phase III trial (n = 144). Other studies have demonstrated protective effects of amifostine in other tumour types and other chemotherapy, radiation and radiochemotherapy regimens; however, evidence is still limited in these indications. No evidence of tumour protection by amifostine has been demonstrated in any clinical trials. Amifostine has also been shown to stimulate haematopoietic stem cells and has been investigated as a therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in number of small preliminary studies. At the recommended dose and schedule, amifostine is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are usually reversible and manageable and those most frequently experienced include nausea and vomiting, transient hypotension and somnolence and sneezing.CONCLUSION: The results of phase III trials have confirmed the safety and efficacy of amifostine as a cytoprotectant to ameliorate cisplatin-induced cumulative renal toxicity, for which it is the only agent proven to be effective, and neutropenia in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, and to reduce xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer receiving irradiation therapy. Depending on the outcome of numerous ongoing clinical trials, amifostine may eventually find broader clinical applications, both as a cytoprotectant and as a potential therapy in myelodysplastic syndrome.

1248,"Radiotherapy of maxillary cancer using 9 equi-spaced beam coplanar beam arrangement and 9 non-coplanar beam arrangement with beam angle optimization - A dosimetric comparison Background: IMRT is a novel radiotherapy that can deliver high conformal homogeneous dose to the target volume while sparing surrounding tissues and structures. Conventional routine IMRT usually uses equi-spaced beam arrangement of 5 to 9. However, in recent development, manipulating the beam arrangement of IMRT is offered in beam angle optimization (BAO), in which it automatically chooses optimized beam angles in either coplanar or non-coplanar beam arrangements. In Pugachev et al. (2001) study it has been suggested that improvement of the dose distribution was seen in complicated head and neck cancer cases with BAO. Nevertheless, opposite opinion has been raised by Stein et al. (1997) which stated that the marginal gain by manipulating beam angle diminished when there are more than 7 beams. Notwithstanding the controversy in study results, it was observed that careful selection of beam orientation contributed to a better dose distribution in the final treatment plan in clinical experience. This study is to investigate the dosimetric effect of manipulating beam angles with BAO in maxillary cancer cases compared with 9 equi-spaced beam co-planar arrangement. Method(s): The subjects in this study were recruited from the Princess Margaret Hospital, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the period of 1st Jan 2006 to 31st Dec 2010. Planning computed tomography (CT) images of the samples were retrospectively restored. Five samples were recruited using random sampling. It was an experimental study to test the effect of using equispaced beams, BAO and VMAT in IMRT. The parameters for comparison are tumour dose conformity, homogeneity; and the OARs maximum, mean dose. 2 plans were produced for each recruited patients. One using 9 equispaced beam arrangement and the other using 9 non-coplanar field using BAO. Result(s): For the five recruited patients, both 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement and BAO resulted in clinically satisfactory dose distribution and were of similar quality. It was found that IMRT plans with BAO resulted in better OARs sparing, including the parotid, cochlear, eyes, optic nerves, the optic chiasm and brain stem. In terms of target coverage, 4 out of 5 plans produced better in BAO when compared with 9 equi-spaced beam arrangement. Conclusion(s): The effect of the selection of beam angle orientations was significant within the samples. The choice of beam orientations is a factor affecting the dosimetric outcome even when the beam number is equal to 9.",Excluded

Treatment involved intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.05 mL) every 6-12 weeks. Treatment was discontinued at patient request or if there was no measurable response to therapy. Main outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity, ophthalmic examination, retinal photography, and angiography.RESULTS: Bevacizumab treatment was followed by reductions in retinal hemorrhage, exudation, and edema. Visual acuities were stable or improved in 86% (n=18). Three patients discontinued therapy. Each was legally blind before treatment (n=1), experienced little to no subjective improvement (n=2), or was poorly compliant (n=2). Three patients (14%) regained 2 or more lines of visual acuity.

2292,"Intracellular analysis of reflex pathways underlying the stumbling corrective reaction during fictive locomotion in the cat In cat and humans, contact between an obstacle and the dorsum of the foot evokes the stumbling corrective reaction (reflex) that lifts the foot to avoid falling. This reflex can also be evoked by short trains of stimuli to the cutaneous superficial peroneal (SP) nerve in decerebrate cats during the flexion phase of fictive locomotion. Here we examine intracellular events in hindlimb motoneurons accompanying stumbling correction. SP stimulation delivered during the flexion phase excites knee flexor motoneurons at short latency [minimum excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) latency 1.8 ms; mean 2.7 ms]. Although a similar short latency excitation occurs in ankle extensors (mean latency, 2.8 ms), recruitment is delayed until successive shocks in the stimulus train overcome the locomotor-related hyperpolarization of ankle extensors. In ankle flexor motoneurons, SP stimulation evokes an inhibition (mean latency, 2.7 ms) that briefly reduces or stops their firing during the flexion phase. There is a phase-dependent modulation of SP-evoked EPSP amplitude as well as latency during locomotion. However, the more obvious change in SP reflex pathways with the onset of fictive locomotion is the reduced inhibition of ankle extensor motoneurons and the increased inhibition of ankle flexors. These results show that the characteristic pattern of hindlimb motoneuron activation during SP nerve-evoked stumbling correction results from 1) di- and trisynaptic excitation of knee flexor and ankle extensor motoneurons; 2) increased inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in ankle flexors and a suppression of inhibition in extensors, 3) sculpting of the short-latency SP postsynaptic effects by motoneuron membrane potential, and 4) longer latency excitatory effects that are likely evoked by lumbar interneurons involved in the generation of fictive locomotion.",Excluded

DNA samples were isolated from whole 5-6-days adult males. The aliquots of DNA were digested by S1-nuclease. Preimaginal stage lethality increased with irradiation dose increasing. At the same time, decrease in imaginal LS (life span) was observed after irradiation with the greatest dose (4 Gy) only. Moreover, hormesis by LS has revealed: in males irradiation with 0.25, 0.75 and 1 Gy increased the mean LS, and with 0.25 and 0.5 Gy caused the maximum LS; in females exposures with 0.25, 0.75 and 2 Gy increased the maximum LS. The densitometric assay of DNA electrophoregrams showed decrease by 39.2% of the part of high-molecular-weight DNA in control as a result of S1-nuclease action. Samples of DNA from the irradiated flies were more stable to enzyme action. The higher stability of DNA originated from the irradiated flies could be the result of reparation system activation. Ultrastructural changes induced at the egg stage by irradiation at the dose of 0.75 Gy testify the increased transcriptional activity of the brain cells.",Included
381,"Differentiating embryonic stem-derived neural stem cells show a maturation-dependent pattern of voltage-gated sodium current expression and graded action potentials A population of mouse embryonic stem (ES)-derived neural stem cells (named NS cells) that exhibits traits reminiscent of radial glia-like cell population and that can be homogeneously expanded in monolayer while remaining stable and highly neurogenic over multiple passages has been recently discovered. This novel population has provided a unique in vitro system in which to investigate physiological events occurring as stem cells lose multipotency and terminally differentiate. Here we analysed the timing, quality and quantity of the appearance of the excitability properties of differentiating NS cells which have been long-term expanded in vitro. To this end, we studied the biophysical properties of voltage-dependent Na(+) currents as an electrophysiological readout for neuronal maturation stages of differentiating NS cells toward the generation of fully functional neurons, since the expression of neuronal voltage-gated Na(+) channels is an essential hallmark of neuronal differentiation and crucial for signal transmission in the nervous system. Using the whole cell and single-channel cell-attached variations of the patch-clamp technique we found that the Na(+) currents in NS cells showed substantial electrophysiological changes during in vitro neuronal differentiation, consisting mainly in an increase of Na(+) current density and in a shift of the steady-state activation and inactivation curves toward more negative and more positive potentials respectively. The changes in the Na(+) channel system were closely related with the ability of differentiating NS cells to generate action potentials, and could therefore be exploited as an appropriate electrophysiological marker of ES-derived NS cells undergoing functional neuronal maturation.",Excluded
1803,"STAT RAD: Prospective Dose Escalation Clinical Trial of Single Fraction Scan-Plan-QA-Treat Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Painful Osseous Metastases PURPOSE: Radiation therapy is a well-established treatment for symptomatic bone metastases. Despite continued advances in both planning techniques and treatment delivery, the standard workflow has remained relatively unchanged, often requiring 1 to 3 weeks and resulting in patient inconvenience and delayed palliation. We developed an expedited method wherein computed tomography simulation, treatment planning, quality assurance, and treatment delivery are performed in 1 day. This prospective pilot clinical trial evaluates the safety, efficacy, and patient satisfaction of this rapid workflow.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with 1 to 3 painful bone metastases were prospectively enrolled and treated with 1 fraction of stereotactic body radiation therapy, using a same-day Scan-Plan-QA-Treat workflow, termed STAT RAD, in a phase 1/2 dose escalation trial from 8 Gy to 15 Gy per fraction. Bone pain, opioid use, patient satisfaction, performance status, and quality of life were evaluated before and at 1, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after treatment. Outcomes and treatment-related toxicity were analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were enrolled, and 46 patients with 60 bone metastases were treated per the protocol. Partial or greater pain response occurred in 50% of patients at 1 week, 75% of patients at 8 weeks, 68.7% of patients at 6 months, and 33.3% of patients at 12 months. There were 2 grade-3 toxicities, including 1 spinal fracture associated with disease progression and hyperbilirubinemia. Reirradiation was required in 16.7% of treated lesions at a median time to retreatment of 4.9 months. Most patient responses (78.6%) indicated that patients would choose this workflow again.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that treating bone metastases with palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy via a single-fraction, patient-centric workflow is feasible and safe with doses up to 15 Gy. However, pain response decreased at 12 months and was associated with a 16.7% retreatment rate, which suggests that further dose escalation is warranted.",Excluded
60,"The efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery in patients with trigeminal neuralgia: The initial experience of the Bezmialem Vakif University Background: Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery is, compared with surgical treatment, a less invasive treatment option for patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Aim(s): In this report, we analyzed the effect and safety of gamma knife radiosurgery performed in patients with TN. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for TN between June 2014 and January 2017. All patients were treated with Leksell Gamma Knife Model C (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) with a prescription dose of 40 Gy with a 50% isodose line. The follow-up of the patients was performed 1 week after the procedure and after every 3 months. The pain score of the patients was recorded using the visual analog scale (VAS). Complications were also reviewed. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software for Windows, version 23.0. Result(s): Twenty-four patients (10 males, 14 females) were included in the study. The median age of the patients was 62.5 years (range, 34-91 years). The pre-gamma knife median VAS was 10 (range, 5-10), and the median VAS was 1 (range, 0-10) during the last follow-up. The pain decreased in 16 (76%) patients. Two patients (9%) had treatment-related complications. One patient developed hypoesthesia along the dermatome of the maxillary branch of the fifth cranial nerve and another patient developed facial paresis, which recovered after the usage of steroids for 3 months. Conclusion(s): Gamma knife radiosurgery is an effective and safe treatment for patients with TN with an acceptable pain control rate.

Since the first description of this type of carcinoma in 1972, 52 patients have been reported in the literature and a variety of treatment regimens have been used. The purpose of this study was to report two new cases and review all previous reports to determine the disease's biological behavior, clinical manifestations, and optimum treatment. Thirty-five percent of the tumors were transglottic, and 27% were supraglottic. Fifty-four percent of patients had regional metastases at initial presentation and 17.6% had distant metastases. The median survival was 10 months for all patients. Patients who were treated with chemotherapy with or without other modalities had the best 2-year survival rates (52.2%). Forty-one percent of patients had regional recurrence only, 12.5% had regional recurrence and distant metastases, and 2% developed distant metastases only.

3609,"Matched-filter coding of sky polarization results in an internal sun compass in the brain of the desert locust Many animals use celestial cues for spatial orientation. These include the sun and, in insects, the polarization pattern of the sky, which depends on the position of the sun. The central complex in the insect brain plays a key role in spatial orientation. In desert locusts, the angle of polarized light in the zenith above the animal and the direction of a simulated sun are represented in a compass-like fashion in the central complex, but how both compasses fit together for a unified representation of external space remained unclear. To address this question, we analyzed the sensitivity of intracellularly recorded central-complex neurons to the angle of polarized light presented from up to 33 positions in the animal's dorsal visual field and injected Neurobiotin tracer for cell identification. Neurons were polarization sensitive in large parts of the virtual sky that in some cells extended to the horizon in all directions. Neurons, moreover, were tuned to spatial patterns of polarization angles that matched the sky polarization pattern of particular sun positions. The horizontal components of these calculated solar positions were topographically encoded in the protocerebral bridge of the central complex covering 360degree of space. This whole-sky polarization compass does not support the earlier reported polarization compass based on stimulation from a small spot above the animal but coincides well with the previously demonstrated direct sun compass based on unpolarized light stimulation. Therefore, direct sunlight and whole-sky polarization complement each other for robust head direction coding in the locust central complex.",Excluded
1323,"OFF response of bullfrog cones is shaped by terminal ionotropic GABA receptors We recently reported an ionotropic GABA receptor expressed at the bullfrog retinal cone terminal that is potentiated by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (BIC) and suppressed by the GABA(C) receptor antagonist imidazole-4-acetic acid (I4AA) . In this study, by using the patch clamp technique in current clamp mode, we show that activation of this GABA receptor causes voltage changes of cones, which are closely dependent on the membrane potential level in relation to the chloride equilibrium potential of the cells. Furthermore, the OFF overshoot of cone light responses is enhanced or diminished when this receptor is potentiated by BIC or suppressed by I4AA, suggesting the involvement of this GABA receptor in shaping OFF light responses of bullfrog cones.",Excluded
3156,"Cryptochromes and inner retinal non-visual irradiance detection Nearly all circadian clocks have free-running periods that differ significantly from 24 hours. To maintain synchrony with the 24 h day, the mammalian circadian clock is reset by light. Unlike other animals, mammalian circadian entrainment occurs exclusively via the eyes and optic nerves. Remarkably, the classical photoreceptors--the rods and cones--are not necessary for photic entrainment. Instead, a subset of inner retinal ganglion cells are directly photoresponsive and transmit photic information specifically to brain centres involved in irradiance detection, including the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The photopigment(s) responsible for inner retinal phototransduction are unknown. Several lines of evidence constrain candidate photopigments. First, near-total vitamin A depletion does not diminish retinohypothalamic signalling. Second, loss of cryptochrome function in retinal-degenerate mice substantially decreases photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and markedly decreases pupillary light responses. Third, vitamin A depletion of cryptochrome mutant mice leads to loss of photic signalling to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These findings suggest a model where either classical photopigments or inner retinal photopigments are sufficient for non-visual irradiance detection.",Excluded
2244,"Neuropelveology. Hope for patients suffering from intractable pelvic pain and for people with spinal cord injury (SCI)?. [German] Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) are common conditions involving many medical specialities, each with its own approach to diagnosis and treatment. Management of these conditions requires knowledge of pelvic organ systems, neuro-functional pelvic anatomy, and of the musculoskeletal, neurologic and psychiatric aspects. No current speciality seems to be devoted to all these aspects of the field. Neuropelveology is an emerging speciality focusing on the pathologies of the pelvic nervous system. It is based on a neurological/ neurosurgical approach combining the knowledge required for a proper neurologic diagnosis with advanced laparoscopic surgery in selected cases of CPP/CPPS. The laparoscopic approach to the pelvic nerves enables nerve-sparing techniques, neurosurgical procedures but also selective placement of stimulating electrodes to all nerves and plexuses for treatment of neuropathic pain and dysfunctions. For patients with spinal cord injuries, this technique enables new strategies for control/recovery-assisted locomotion in selected paraplegics. The development of new technologies does not only assist spinal cord injured people with the common problems associated with inertia when confined to a wheelchair, but finds further revolutionary applications in the world of space missions. In addressing the physical disadvantages the astronaut faces when weightless in space by the introduction of an >>in-body<< micro stimulator, which allows muscle mass and bone density to be maintained even whilst the astronaut is sleeping, the stimulating technique provides an extremely effective and time-saving strength training program. The advantages of the LION Procedure (Laparoscopic Implantation of Neuroprothesis) are profound when it comes to counteracting the effects of prolonged microgravity on the human body. It should be also appreciated that the capability of the implantation of micro stimulators within the body to nerves for muscle stimulation, opens the door to a whole new area of humanity, the >>e-control-body<<, in which implanted electronics may help the human body to better performance and a longer life as a result (ageing control).

The goal of this study was to review the treatment duration, toxicity, and survival for patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation. Methods Women with stage III-IV endometrial cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation between 2006 and 2013 were included. Toxicities were classified per CTCAE v3.0 and RTOG/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify treatment and toxicities. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Results Fifty-one patients met our inclusion criteria. Median age was 60 (range 33-85). Thirty-six patients (70.6%) had endometrioid histology, 13 patients (25.5%) had serous, clear cell, or mixed histology, and 2 women (3.9%) had carcinosarcoma. Forty-eight patients had stage III disease and three patients were stage IVB. Mean treatment duration was 107 +/- 19 days. Forty-two patients received all planned chemotherapy, and 16 patients required a dose reduction. Thirty-four patients (66.7%) experienced grade 3-4 toxicities, the majority of which were hematologic. There were no deaths related to therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients received leukocyte growth factors, and 25% of patients received a blood transfusion. Seven late grade 3-4 complications occurred: four gastrointestinal and two genitourinary, and one patient had ongoing neuropathy. Median progression-free survival was 42.8 months (range 4.4-81.5 months) and median overall survival was 44.9 months (range 5.1-82.6 months). Three-year overall survival was 80%.

Shortly before saccade onset, dTMS with different interstimulus intervals (ISI; 35, 50, 65 or 80 ms) was applied. For contralateral saccades, dTMS significantly decreased saccadic latency with an ISI of 80 ms and increased saccadic gain with an ISI of 65 and 80 ms.

Firstly, dTMS facilitates saccade triggering in both regions, but the timing is different. Secondly, dTMS over the PPC provokes a hypermetria of contralateral memory-guided saccades that was not observed during FEF stimulation.

2772,"Cancer pain (classification and pain syndromes) Inspite the new informations about the physiology and biochemistry of pain, it remains true that pain is only partially understood. Cancer pain is often experienced as several different types of pain, with combined somatic and neuropathic types the most frequently. If the acute cancer pain does not subside with initial therapy, patients experience pain of more constant nature, the characteristics of wich vary with the cause and the involved sites. Chronic pain related to cancer can be considered as tumor-induced pain, chemotherapy-induced pain, and radiation therapy-induced pain. Certain pain mechanisms are present in cancer patients. These include inflammation due to infection, such as local sepsis or the pain of herpes zoster, and pain due to the obstruction or occlusion of a hollow organ, such as that caused by large bowel in cancer of colon. Pain also is commonly due to destruction of tissue, such as is often seen with bony metastases. Bony metastases also produce pain because of periostal irritation, medullary pressure, and fractures. Pain may be produced by the growth of tumor in a closed area richly supplied with pain receptors (nociceptors). Examples are tumors growing within the capsule of an organ such as the pancreas. Chest pain occurring after tumor of the lung or the mediastinum due to invasion of the pleura. Certain tumors produce characteristic types of pain. For example, back pain is seen with multiple myeloma, and severe shoulder pain and arm pain is seen with Pancoast tumors. [References: 42]",Excluded

No differences between control and exposure experiments were shown under these routines of data averaging. Significant elevations of EEG asymmetry in 10-14 Hz range were observed during the first 20 s after four from five onsets of the MW field, when averaged spectra were obtained for every 10 s.

318,"Plasma membrane nanoporation as a possible mechanism behind infrared excitation of cells OBJECTIVE: Short infrared (IR) laser pulses have been used to stimulate action potentials in neurons both in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon has remained elusive. In vitro studies have found that pulsed IR exposure generates a nearly instant change in capacitance in the plasma membrane, characterized by inward rectification, a common feature in pore-forming exposures, such as electrical pulses and acoustic shock waves. Based on this similarity, we hypothesize that the mechanism of IR stimulation is the formation of short-lived nanopores in the plasma membrane. These transient, small-diameter pores allow the influx of extracellular ions that lead to action potential generation, possibly through activation of secondary messenger pathways or depolarization of the cell membrane resulting in activation of voltage-gated ion channels.APPROACH: A variety of fluorescent markers are used to observe the cell response to IR stimulation to monitor for effects indicative of nanoporation in other modalities.MAIN RESULTS: We observe rapid, transient rises in intracellular Ca(2+), influx of YO-PRO-1 and propidium iodide into the cell signifying membrane permeabilization, cellular blebbing and swelling, and activation of the intracellular phosphoinositides lipid signaling pathway.SIGNIFICANCE: This conclusion better explains the experimental observations and limitations of IR-induced neurological stimulation and represents a distinct theoretical shift in the understanding of the mechanism of IR-induced stimulation.",Excluded

2124,"Gold Nanorod-assisted Optical Stimulation of Neuronal Cells Recent studies have demonstrated that nerves can be stimulated in a variety of ways by the transient heating associated with the absorption of infrared light by water in neuronal tissue. This technique holds great potential for replacing or complementing standard stimulation techniques, due to the potential for increased localization of the stimulus and minimization of mechanical contact with the tissue. However, optical approaches are limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate deep into tissues. Moreover, thermal modelling suggests that cumulative heating effects might be potentially hazardous when multiple stimulus sites or high laser repetition rates are used. The protocol outlined below describes an enhanced approach to the infrared stimulation of neuronal cells. The underlying mechanism is based on the transient heating associated with the optical absorption of gold nanorods, which can cause triggering of neuronal cell differentiation and increased levels of intracellular calcium activity. These results demonstrate that nanoparticle absorbers can enhance and/or replace the process of infrared neural stimulation based on water absorption, with potential for future applications in neural prostheses and cell therapies.",Excluded

However, for extensive brain coverage, a large number of slices is required, resulting in long acquisition times (TAs). Recording multiple slices simultaneously (SMS) promises to reduce the TA. Methods A combination of zoomed and parallel imaging is used to achieve high isotropic resolution dMRI data with a low level of distortions at 7T. The blipped-CAIPI (controlled aliasing in parallel imaging) approach is used to acquire several slices simultaneously. Due to their high radiofrequency (RF) power deposition and ensuing specific absorption rate (SAR) constraints, the commonly used multiband (MB) RF pulses for SMS imaging are inefficient at 7T and entail long repetition times, counteracting the usefulness of SMS acquisitions. To address this issue, low SAR multislice Power Independent of Number of Slices RF pulses are employed. Results In vivo dMRI results with and without SMS acceleration are presented at different isotropic spatial resolutions at ultra high field strength. The datasets are recorded at a high angular resolution to detect fiber crossings.

AIM: The aim of this study is to show the practical use of, and to discuss the rationale for, high-end computed tomography (CT) integrated with intrinsic low-resolution single-photon emission tomography (SPECT).MATERIALS AND METHODS: All examinations performed on three new SPECT/CT systems with diagnostic CT capabilities were recorded retrospectively. The use of CT was classified as low-dose, using the CT with restraint as to the tube current and radiation dose, or diagnostic, with an optimum use of the CT, using CT protocols as used in ordinary radiological practice. The number of low-dose CT was compared with the number of diagnostic CT examinations. The report is based on 436 patient examinations from three hospitals in Norway with recently installed SPECT/CT systems, the time of use varying from 6 months to 2 years. The examinations performed were myocardial perfusion (45%), various tumors (thyroid, parathyroid, neuroendocrine 37%), malignant skeletal disease (12%), brain perfusion (4%), sentinel nodes in breast cancer (1%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (1%).RESULTS: Of the 436 patients, 431 had a low-dose CT for attenuation correction, anatomic localisation and, also for diagnosis, whereas five patients had a diagnostic CT.

Preincubation with 10 microM CBX reduced the amount of LTP induced by weak theta-burst stimulation (TBS) or a single train of stimuli (HFS; 1s at 100 Hz), but did not affect LTP induced by 30-min perfusion with 10 mM taurine.

At 100 microM CBX, the concentration that is used for the blockade of gap junctions in vitro, a long-lasting depression of fEPSPs was observed which persisted under the blockade of NMDA receptors, and receptors for corticosteroids. A similar depression was produced by the CBX inactive analogue glycyrrhizic acid and the broad spectrum calcium channel antagonist ruthenium red. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from acutely isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that CBX exerts a selective dose-dependent inhibition of NMDA-evoked currents with an IC(50)=104 microM.

One of the hypotheses for gait impairment in NPH is the affection of periventricular white matter. METHODS In this study 15 patients were investigated for possible NPH. All patients underwent diagnostic testing (lumbar infusion test and 5 days of external lumbar drainage for diagnosis of NPH). Only the patients with positive diagnostic response were included in the study (n=10), all patients with postive response were finally treated by venriculoperitoneal shunt. All patients underwent MRI examination including T2W, T1W and DTI sequence of the whole brain in axial sections (EPI, TR/TE=12,000/ 89.4 ms, 40 slices with thickness of 2,4 mm, no gap, 128x 128 matrix, FOV 24x24 cm2; along 30 noncollinear gradient directions with b value of 1000 s/mm2, with additional five b=0 images).

The ROIs were placed two slices above the slice where anterior comissure could be detected. A Mann Whitney U test was used for the analysis of the results. Tract based spatial statistics method (TBSS) was also used. RESULTS The fractional anisotropy was decreased significantly in the NPH patient group compared to the controls (p<0,01) in fornix, right genu of the capsula interna and left optical radiation (p< 0,05), the data showed some trend (p<0,1) in ADC of the left and right optical radiation. The results were similar using TBSS. CONCLUSION The DTI measurements may reveal the white matter structural imparirment in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus. As a possible non-invasive diagnostic marker it deserves further attention and investigation.",Excluded

330,"[Neuroradiological response criteria for malignant gliomas] This article summarizes the new response criteria of the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group and the clinical implications. The RANO criteria represent an important step forward in the accurate assessment of response to therapy in patients with malignant gliomas, not only in clinical trials but also in daily practice. The introduction of new substances to glioma therapy, such as antiangiogenic drugs, has complicated the assessment of efficacy by MRI due to profound effects on the vascular biology of these tumors. Moreover new treatment modalities have increased the incidence and awareness of imaging phenomena, such as pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse, not only within clinical trials but also outside. In addition to MRI the new RANO criteria also take clinical parameters, such as steroid medication and neurological symptoms, into account. Thus both neuroradiologists and neurologists/neurooncologists need to be aware of and experienced in applying these criteria when treating patients with malignant gliomas to be able to correctly assess the response to therapy.",Excluded
1743,"Regulation of prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> synthesis after brain irradiation Purpose: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> (PGE <inf>2</inf>) levels seen after radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE <inf>2</inf> production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE<inf>2</inf> production and PGES expression. Result(s): As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE<inf>2</inf> levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE<inf>2</inf> seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls. Conclusion(s): Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE<inf>2</inf> production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",Included

Because it requires no ionizing radiation, MRI allows multiple studies of the same patient, study of family members, and recruitment of unbiased samples of control subjects. Use of MRI may help address questions regarding the specificity and prevalence of brain abnormalities observed with CT in psychotic patients.",Excluded
288,"Ataxia telangiectasia mutant protein activates c-Abl tyrosine kinase in response to ionizing radiation Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder with pleiotropic phenotypes, including neuronal degeneration, immune dysfunction, premature ageing and increased cancer risk. The gene mutated in AT, ATM, encodes a putative lipid or protein kinase. Most of the human AT patient phenotypes are recapitulated in Atm-deficient mice. Cells derived from Atm-/- mice, like those from AT patients, exhibit abnormal response to ionizing radiation. One of the known responses to ionizing radiation is the activation of a nuclear tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-abl proto-oncogene. Ionizing radiation does not activate c-Abl in cells from AT patients or in thymocytes or fibroblasts from the Atm-deficient mice. Ectopic expression of a functional ATM kinase domain corrects this defect, as it phosphorylates the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in vitro at Ser 465, leading to the activation of c-Abl. A mutant c-Abl with Ser 465 changed to Ala 465 is not activated by ionizing radiation or ATM kinase in vivo. These findings identify the c-Abl tyrosine kinase as a downstream target of phosphorylation and activation by the ATM kinase in the cellular response to ionizing radiation.",Excluded
2550,"Assembly of actin-containing cortex occurs at distal regions of growing neurites in PC12 cells Although actin filaments are known to be localized in the cortex of axons and in the growth cones of nerve cells, it is unclear how actin-containing structures are assembled during nerve growth. We have studied the formation of actin structures in growing neurites by microinjecting fluorescent phalloidin or actin into PC12 neuron-like cells to label endogenous actin filaments. Upon stimulation of neurite growth in cells microinjected with fluorescent phalloidin, little or no fluorescence was detected in nascent growth cones and adjacent neurites despite the presence of actin filaments in these regions, suggesting that actin filaments were primarily formed by de novo assembly rather than the transport and reorganization of pre-existing, phalloidin-labeled actin filaments. Time-lapse observations of the distribution of phalloidin-labeled actin filaments during neurite elongation confirmed that fluorescence associated with pre-existing neurite cortex spread out more slowly than the elongation of neurites. Furthermore, when a dark spot was photobleached with a laser microbeam along neurites of cells microinjected with either fluorescent phalloidin or actin, the spot showed no appreciable translocation during active neurite elongation. Taken together, these results suggest that de novo assembly of actin filaments plays a crucial role in the formation of growth cones and adjacent cortex in the distal region of neurites, but does not appear to require the anterograde or retrograde transport of cortical filaments, or the passive stretching of the proximal segment of the neurite cortex.",Excluded
3543,"Spinal epidural tumor in patients with prostate cancer: Clinical and radiographic predictors of response to radiation therapy The authors retrospectively reviewed 50 episodes of spinal epidural tumor that occurred in 42 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and were treated with external-beam radiation. Treatment response was evaluated in terms of symptoms, neurologic status, and, in most cases, reduction of tumor on repeat myelography. At the completion of therapy, 92% of treated patients experienced pain relief and 67% had significant to complete improvement on neurologic examination. Thirty days after treatment, repeat myelography was performed in 40 of the 50 cases; compared with the initial findings immediately preceding radiation therapy (RT), the results of 58% of these studies had normalized completely, results were improved in 25%, and the results had not changed in 18%. The presence of a high-grade compression fracture of the vertebral body was an indicator of poor prognosis for tumor response on repeat myelography. The ability of a patient to walk before treatment and tumor response on repeat myelography were associated significantly with improved outcome of RT and with survival. The authors conclude that RT can effectively palliate epidural lesions from metastatic prostate cancer. The prognosis for the long-term response to therapy may be indicated by pretreatment ambulatory status and posttreatment imaging of the epidural space.",Excluded
1794,"Acute vagus nerve stimulation using different pulse widths produces varying brain effects BACKGROUND: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved treatment for epilepsy and has been investigated in clinical trials of depression. Little is known about the relationship of VNS parameters to brain function. Using the interleaved VNS /functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, we tested whether variations of VNS pulse width (PW) would produce different immediate brain activation in a manner consistent with single neuron PW studies.METHODS: Twelve adult patients with major depression, treated with VNS, underwent three consecutive VNS/fMRI scans, each randomly using one of three PWs (130 micros, 250 micros, or 500 micros). The data were analyzed with SPM2.RESULTS: Global activations induced by PWs 250 and 500 were both significantly greater than that induced by PW 130 but not significantly different from each other. For global deactivation, PWs 130 and 250 were both significantly greater than PW 500 but not significantly different from each other. Regional similarities and differences were also seen with the various PWs.CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm our hypothesis that VNS at PW 500 globally produces no more activation than does PW 250, and PW 130 is insufficient for activation of some regions. These data suggest that PW is an important variable in producing VNS brain effects.",Excluded
2625,"Selective nanoparticle-directed ablation of the canine prostate BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer type and the second most common cause of cancer death among US men. This study, adapted a previously reported nanoparticle-directed photothermal treatment of brain tumors to the treatment of prostate disease by using normal canine prostate in vivo, directly injected with a suspension of nanoparticles as a proxy for prostate tumor, and by developing laser dosimetry for prostate which is marginally ablative in native tissue, yet producing photothermal coagulation in prostate tissue containing nanoparticles.METHODS: Canine prostates were exposed by surgical laparotomy and directly injected with suspensions of nanoparticles (nanoshells) and irradiated by a NIR laser source delivered percutaneously by an optical fiber catheter and isotropic diffuser. The photothermal lesions were permitted to resolve for up to 8 days, at which time each animal was euthanized, necropsied, and the prostate taken for histopathological and elemental analysis.RESULTS: Nanoparticles were retained for up to 4 hours in prostate and served as a proxy for prostate tumor. A marginally ablative laser dose of 3.0 W for 3 minutes was developed which would yield 4 mm-radius coagulo-necrotic lesions if nanoparticles were present.CONCLUSION: We have shown that the addition of nanoshells to native tissue, combined with a marginally ablative laser dose can generate ablative thermal lesions, and that the radial extent of the thermal lesions is strictly confined to within ~4 mm of the optical fiber with sub-millimeter uncertainty. This, in turn, suggests a means of precise tumor ablation with an ability to obviate damage to critical structures limited primarily by the precision with which the optical fiber applicator can be placed. In so doing, it should be possible to realize a precise, nerve bundle and urethra sparing prostate cancer treatment using a minimally invasive, percutaneous approach.",Excluded
484,"Spatial Memory Performance of Socially Mature Wistar Rats is Impaired after Exposure to Low (5 cGy) Doses of 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti Particles Prolonged deep space missions to planets and asteroids will expose astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), a mixture of low-LET ionizing radiations, high-energy protons and high-Z and energy (HZE) particles. Ground-based experiments are used to determine whether this radiation environment will have an effect on the long-term health of astronauts and their ability to complete various tasks during their mission. Emerging data suggest that mission-relevant HZE doses impair several hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive processes in rodents, but that there is substantial interindividual variation in the severity of neurocognitive impairment, ranging from no observable effects to severe impairment. While the majority of studies have established the effect that the most abundant HZE species (<sup>56</sup>Fe) has on neurocognition, some studies suggest that the lighter <sup>48</sup>Ti HZE particles may be equally, if not more, potent at impairing neurocognition. In this study, we assessed the effect that exposure to 5-20 cGy 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti had on the spatial memory performance of socially mature male Wistar rats. Acute exposures to mission-relevant doses (<=5 cGy) of 1 GeV/n <sup>48</sup>Ti significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the mean spatial memory performance of the rats at three months after exposure, and significantly (P < 0.015) increased the percentage of rats that have severe (Z score >= 2) impairment, i.e., poor performers.

213,"Extraction of optical properties and prediction of light distribution in rat brain tissue Predicting the distribution of light inside any turbid media, such as biological tissue, requires detailed information about the optical properties of the medium, including the absorption and scattering coefficients and the anisotropy factor. Particularly, in biophotonic applications where photons directly interact with the tissue, this information translates to system design optimization, precision in light delivery, and minimization of unintended consequences, such as phototoxicity or photobleaching. In recent years, optogenetics has opened up a new area in deep brain stimulation with light and the method is widely adapted by researchers for the study of the brain circuitries and the dynamics of neurological disorders. A key factor for a successful optogenetic stimulation is delivering an adequate amount of light to the targeted brain objects. The adequate amount of light needed to stimulate each brain object is identified by the tissue optical properties as well as the type of opsin expressed in the tissue, wavelength of the light, and the physical dimensions of the targeted area. Therefore, to implement a precise light delivery system for optogenetics, detailed information about the optical properties of the brain tissue and a mathematical model that incorporates all determining factors is needed to find a good estimation of light distribution in the brain. In general, three measurements are required to obtain the optical properties of any tissue, namely diffuse transmitted light, diffuse reflected light, and transmitted ballistic beam. In this report, these parameters were measured in vitro using intact rat brain slices of 500 mum thickness via a two-integrating spheres optical setup. Then, an inverse adding doubling method was used to extract the optical properties of the tissue from the collected data. These experiments were repeated to cover the whole brain tissue with high spatial resolution for the three different cuts (transverse, sagittal, and coronal) and three different wavelengths (405, 532, and 635 nm) in the visible range of the spectrum. A three-dimensional atlas of the rat brain optical properties was constructed based on the experimental measurements. This database was linked to a Monte Carlo toolbox to simulate light distribution in the tissue for different light source configurations.",Excluded

2232,"Gene expression in rat vestibular and reticular structures during and after space flight Space flight produces profound changes of neuronal activity in the mammalian vestibular and reticular systems, affecting postural and motor functions. These changes are compensated over time by plastic alterations in the brain. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful indicators of both activity changes and neuronal plasticity. We studied the expression of two IEG protein products [Fos and Fos-related antigens (FRAs)] with different cell persistence times (hours and days, respectively) to identify brainstem vestibular and reticular structures involved in adaptation to microgravity and readaptation to 1 G (gravity) during the NASA Neurolab Mission (STS-90). IEG protein expression in flight animals was compared to that of ground controls using Fisher 344 rats killed 1 and 12 days after launch and 1 and 14 days after landing. An increase in the number of Fos-protein-positive cells in vestibular (especially medial and spinal) regions was observed 1 day after launch and 1 day after landing. Fos-positive cell numbers were no different from controls 12 days after launch or 14 days after landing. No G-related changes in IEG expression were observed in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pattern of FRA protein expression was generally similar to that of Fos, except at 1 day after landing, when FRA-expressing cells were observed throughout the whole spinal vestibular nucleus, but only in the caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus. Fos expression was found throughout the entire medial vestibular nucleus at this time. While both Fos and FRA expression patterns may reflect the increased G force experienced during take-off and landing, the Fos pattern may additionally reflect recent rebound episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep following forced wakefulness, especially after landing. Pontine activity sources producing rhythmic discharges of vestibulo-oculomotor neurons during REM sleep could substitute for labyrinthine signals after exposure to microgravity, contributing to activity-related plastic changes leading to G readaptation. Reticular structures exhibited a contrasting pattern of changes in the numbers of Fos- and FRA-positive cells suggestive of a major influence from proprioceptive inputs, and plastic re-weighting of inputs after landing. Asymmetric induction of Fos and FRAs observed in some vestibular nuclei 1 day after landing suggests that activity asymmetries between bilateral otolith organs, their primary labyrinthine afferents, and vestibular nuclei may become unmasked during flight.",Included
3510,"Nuclear Import Receptor Inhibits Phase Separation of FUS through Binding to Multiple Sites Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-beta2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-beta2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-beta2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS. Karyopherin-beta2 may act analogously to control condensates in diverse cellular contexts.",Excluded
3393,"Flow cytometric analysis of rat striatal nerve terminals Methods were developed for the analysis and isolation of striatal nerve terminals (synaptosomes) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Comparison of the light-scattering properties of synaptosomal and mitochondrial fractions indicated that particles in the synaptosomal fraction were generally larger and more sensitive to hypotonic lysis, consistent with results obtained by other methods of analysis. FACS analysis using indirect immunofluorescence techniques indicated that approximately 84% of the synaptosomal fraction was labeled by monoclonal antibody (mAb) A2B5 and thus appeared to be of neuronal origin. After permeabilization, between 5 and 10% of the particles were labeled by a mAb to glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting that they were derived from astrocytes. A fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) was used to distinguish intact synaptosomes from free mitochondria (only the former maintain a membrane potential under the present experimental conditions). Approximately 83% of the synaptosomal fraction exhibited increased fluorescence after incubation with the VSD; furthermore, the fluorescence signal decreased in response to depolarizing agents (elevated potassium and veratridine). A portion of the mitochondrial fraction responded similarly, consistent with the presence of contaminating synaptosomes. Analysis of synaptosomal labeling by 11 fluorescein-conjugated plant lectins indicated that striatal nerve terminals differ significantly in their cell surface glycoconjugates. Subpopulations of synaptosomes defined on the basis of lectin binding were collected by FACS onto filters and probed with a mAb to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) using Western blot techniques. While subpopulations exhibited different amounts of TH immunoreactivity, none of the lectins appeared to recognize TH-positive (i.e., dopaminergic) synaptosomes exclusively. These findings demonstrate that synaptosomes can be characterized and isolated for further study based on FACS analysis of properties such as size, membrane potential, and the presence of intracellular or cell surface molecules.",Excluded
639,"Firing rates and dynamic correlated activities of ganglion cells both contribute to retinal information processing In the present study, the electrical activities of paired retinal ganglion cells, under full field light stimuli with a variety of chromatic configurations, were recorded from a small functioning piece of retina using multi-electrode array (MEA). Neurons that had increased firings at light-ON and -OFF transients and did not show color-opponent properties were investigated. Single neuronal analysis showed that firing rate of each individual neuron was dependent on the intensity of illumination. Multi-unit analyses revealed that adjacent neurons often fired in synchrony in response to light stimulation. However, in some cases, the strength of correlation between the paired neurons was higher when the retina was exposed to red or green light, and the correlation was attenuated when yellow or white light was given. This seems to suggest that the ensemble activity of non-color-opponent ganglion cells might partly participate in color-information processing, with the red- and green-pathway inputs influencing each other. Such arrangement reflects principle of parsimony: the firing rates of single neuron represent the luminance intensity, and the correlated activities may tell the brain about the color information.",Excluded

Light activation in rod photoreceptors was established using a paired-flash electroretinogram (ERG) protocol, and the leading edge of the a-wave was modeled with the mechanisms mediating phototransduction. Deactivation of the photoreceptor response was evaluated at three luminous exposures (1.4-2.2 log cd.m/s-2) using a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) paradigm. Dark adaptation was evaluated at 90-second intervals for 30 minutes after approximately 20% pigment bleach. At each time point, a paired-flash signal (1.4 log cd.s/m-2) was used to extract rod responses.RESULTS: Diabetic animals showed decreased amplitudes of the photoreceptor response 12 weeks after diabetes induction. No difference was found in the rate of deactivation of the photoresponse in diabetic rats. Normalized amplitudes showed that diabetic animals had significantly faster dark adaptation (P<0.01) than did controls.CONCLUSIONS: Although photoreceptor activation was abnormal, deactivation was unaltered after 12 weeks of diabetes. The faster relative recovery found in diabetes after bleach, in the presence of normal pigment dynamics, may reflect a decrease in outer segment lengths.",Excluded
3294,"Macrophage attenuation of neuronal excitability: implications for pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders Brain macrophages (and microglia) play a crucial role in central nervous system immune and inflammatory responses. They are also critical cells in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. To understand how macrophages cause neural cell dysfunction, we investigated the effects of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) on rat cortical neuronal physiology in a BMDM-neuronal co-culture system using whole-cell patch clamp techniques. When co-cultured with neuronal cells, BMDMs hyperpolarized the neuronal membrane and attenuated both spontaneous and electrically evoked firings through a decrease in membrane input resistance. The average duration of evoked action potentials (APs) and the latency to fire the APs, in response to a constant depolarizing current injection, were significantly increased by BMDMs. These results indicate that BMDMs attenuate neuronal excitability. Further investigation revealed that BMDMs hyperpolarize neuronal membranes by enhancing neuronal delayed rectifier potassium current (IK), which was blocked by tetraethylammonium. This BMDM-induced attenuation on neuronal excitability may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuronal dysfunction and damage as seen in neurodegenerative disorders.",Excluded

To date, we have demonstrated that optogenetic sensory nerve stimulation rapidly alters the dopamine (DA) content within the mNAc. However, the physiological role and biochemical processes underlying such rapid and regional dynamics of DA remain unclear. In this study, using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), we observed that sensitized pain stimulation by optogenetic sensory nerve activation increased DA and 3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT; a post-synaptic metabolite obtained following DA degradation) in the mNAc of the experimental mice. To delineate the mechanism associated with elevation of DA and 3-MT, the de novo synthesized DA in the VTA/substantia nigra terminal areas was evaluated using IMS by visualizing the metabolic conversion of stable isotope-labeled tyrosine (<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-Tyr) to DA. Our approach revealed that at steady state, the de novo synthesized DA occupied >10% of the non-labeled DA pool in the NAc within 1.5h of isotope-labeled Tyr administration, despite no significant increase following pain stimulation. These results suggested that sensitized pain triggered an increase in the release and postsynaptic intake of DA in the mNAc, followed by its degradation, and likely delayed de novo DA synthesis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that short, peripheral nerve excitation with mechanical stimulation accelerates the mNAc-specific DA signaling and metabolism which might be associated with the development of mechanical allodynia.",Excluded

METHOD(S): In 27 patients with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors a single intravenous injection of talaporfin sodium (40 mg/m2) was administered one day before surgical resection of the neoplasm. Next day after completion of the tumor removal the residual lesion and/or resection cavity were irradiated with 664-nmsemiconductor laser with a radiation power density of 150 mW/cm2 and radiation energy density of 27 J/cm2. The procedure was performed at 22-27 hours after drug administration. The study cohort included 22 patients with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumor. Thirteen of these neoplasms (59%) were newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RESULT(S): Among all 22 patients included into study cohort the 12-month overall survival (OS), 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), and 6-months local PFS rates after surgery and PDT were 95.5%, 91%, and 91%, respectively. Among patients with newly diagnosed GBM all these parameters were 100%. Side effects on the skin, which could be attributable to administration of talaporfin sodium, were noted in 7% of patients and included rush (2 cases), blister (1 case), and erythema (1 case). Skin photosensitivity test results were relatively mild and fully disappeared within 15 days after administration of photosensitizer in all patients. CONCLUSION(S): Intraoperative PDT using talaporfin sodium and semiconductor laser may be considered as potentially effective and sufficiently safe option for adjuvant management of primary malignant parenchymal brain tumors. Its inclusion in combined treatment strategy may have a positive impact on OS and local tumor control, particularly in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.",Excluded

Treatments were designed using VMAT in Treatment System Planning Pinnacle V.9.2 (Philips N.V, Koninklijke Holland) with multiple arcs, and delivered with a linear accelerator Elekta Synergy (Elekta A.B., Stockholm, Sweden). The dose scheme used is the one reported by Lagerwaard: [WBRT(20Gy) + SIBmts (40Gy)]/5 fr. Patient positioning is verified daily using IGRT with Elekta XVI, before and after treatment. Before optimization is performed, some auxiliary volumes are created: a 3mm ring around calota,called Follicles, and a volume contracted 12mm from the outer one, called CPE. Two CCW VMAT arcs (178degree to 60degree and 300degree to 182degree) are added, with the following objectives: Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 1), brain-CPE (D<inf>max</inf>= 21 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 20 Gy, weight = 50), eyes(D<inf>max</inf>= 10 Gy, weight = 1). Thereafter, we work separately on the metastases blocking the optimization of the prophylaxis and creating three structures: VI1 = PTV (MTS1)+ 5 mm, VI2 = PTV (MTS2)+ 5 mm, Epx = brain-VI1-VI2. Objectives were: PTVI (D<inf>max</inf>= 44 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 40 Gy weight = 50), Epx (D<inf>max</inf>= 30 Gy) ,brain stem (D<inf>max</inf>= 23 Gy) and Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 20). Result(s): We have treated 14 patients until now. Fusion images have shown differences less than 1mm while mean IGRT correction has been 1.34mm. No acute toxicity have been observed, including neither alopecia nor temporal depilation. Conclusion(s): This protocol has been designed and developed in our hospital, considering the alopecia as toxicity in VMAT optimization. It produces excellent cosmetic results, avoiding alopecia in practically all cases, which has a direct impact on patient quality of life. As a general consideration, we would like to point out that that it should be considered mandatory to use all advanced tools available on modern radiotherapy to minimize toxicity in radiation treatments.",Excluded

[Russian] The study of hormonal shifts and immunity in 95 patients with burns has revealed hyperergic reaction of the neuroendocrine system in the early period after trauma, accompanied by a marked and prolonged inhibition of cellular and humoral immunity. The use of antistress agents (clofelin, pentamine) and intravenous laser blood irradiation leads to a more prompt arrest of hyperergic reaction of the neuroendocrine system and to the reduction of immunosuppressing effect of burn trauma, which decreases the number of pyoseptic complications from 26.4 to 16% and total lethality from 16 to 3.8%.",Excluded
788,"Brain irradiation leads to persistent neuroinflammation and long-term neurocognitive dysfunction in a region-specific manner Long-term cognitive deficits are observed after treatment of brain tumors or metastases by radiotherapy. Treatment optimization thus requires a better understanding of the effects of radiotherapy on specific brain regions, according to their sensitivity and interconnectivity. In the present study, behavioral tests supported by immunohistology and magnetic resonance imaging provided a consistent picture of the persistent neurocognitive decline and neuroinflammation after the onset of irradiation-induced necrosis in the right primary somatosensory cortex of Fischer rats. Necrosis surrounded by neovascularization was first detected 54 days after irradiation and then spread to 110 days in the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory region, striatum and right ventricle, resulting in fiber bundle disruption and demyelination in the corpus callosum of the right hemisphere. These structural damages translated into selective behavioral changes including spatial memory loss, disinhibition of anxiety-like behaviors, hyperactivity and pain hypersensitivity, but no significant alteration in motor coordination and grip strength abilities. Concomitantly, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, accompanied by infiltration of leukocytes (CD45+) and T-cells (CD3+) cooperated to shape the neuroinflammation response. Overall, our study suggests that the slow and gradual onset of cellular damage would allow adaptation in brain regions that are susceptible to neuronal plasticity; while other cerebral structures that do not have this capacity would be more affected. The planning of radiotherapy, adjusted to the sensitivity and adaptability of brain structures, could therefore preserve certain neurocognitive functions; while higher doses of radiation could be delivered to brain areas that can better adapt to this treatment. In addition, strategies to block early post-radiation events need to be explored to prevent the development of long-term cognitive dysfunction.",Included
2862,"Long-Term Outcomes and Patterns of Failure After Surgical Resection of Small-Cell Lung Cancer Background The role of surgical resection as a treatment option for early-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is controversial, and few data exist regarding the patterns of treatment failure in these patients. Patients and Methods The medical records of all patients receiving definitive surgical management of SCLC at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from January 1, 1985 to December 31, 2012 were reviewed. Estimates of survival and recurrence risk were recorded using the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparative analyses were performed with Cox regression analysis. Results A total of 54 patients were identified. The median follow-up period was 5.9 years. At 5 years, overall survival was 37% and recurrence-free survival 44%. Intrathoracic recurrence, the most frequent treatment failure, occurred in 14 patients, with an estimated intrathoracic recurrence-free survival at 3 years of 64.4%. Patients undergoing wedge resection or segmentectomy, rather than lobectomy or pneumonectomy, had an increased risk of intrathoracic recurrence (hazard ratio, 3.5; P =.01). Overall survival was improved at 5 years after lobectomy or pneumonectomy compared with wedge resection or segmentectomy (48% vs. 15%, respectively; P =.03). Conclusion Surgical resection of SCLC can achieve reasonable treatment outcomes and can be considered for well-selected patients with clinical early-stage disease. Intrathoracic recurrence is the most common site of treatment failure. Caution should be taken with patients who are unable to tolerate at least lobectomy, because they are at a high risk of local recurrence. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

1947,"Myelin repair by Schwann cells in the regenerating goldfish visual pathway: regional patterns revealed by X-irradiation In the regenerating goldfish optic nerves, Schwann cells of unknown origin reliably infiltrate the lesion site forming a band of peripheral-type myelinating tissue by 1-2 months, sharply demarcated from the adjacent new CNS myelin. To investigate this effect, we have interfered with cell proliferation by locally X-irradiating the fish visual pathway 24h after the lesion. As assayed by immunohistochemistry and EM, irradiation retards until 6 months formation of new myelin by Schwann cells at the lesion site, and virtually abolishes oligodendrocyte myelination distally, but has little or no effect on nerve fibre regrowth. Optic nerve astrocyte processes normally fail to re-infiltrate the lesion, but re-occupy it after irradiation, suggesting that they are normally excluded by early cell proliferation at this site. Moreover, scattered myelinating Schwann cells also appear in the oligodendrocyte-depleted distal optic nerve after irradiation, although only as far as the optic tract. Optic nerve reticular astrocytes differ in various ways from radial glia elsewhere in the fish CNS, and our observations suggest that they may be more permissive to Schwann cell invasion of CNS tissue.",Included

Each course was repeated every 4 weeks. Tumor response was evaluated and for 15 patients (41%) with a partial or complete regression after 3 radio-chemotherapy courses conventional radiotherapy was added. Eleven percent of all patients were in complete remission at the end of a treatment.

2865,"White matter changes in breast cancer brain metastases patients who undergo radiosurgery alone compared to whole brain radiation therapy plus radiosurgery Delayed toxicity after whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is of increasing concern in patients who survive more than one year with brain metastases from breast cancer. Radiation-related white matter toxicity is detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and has been correlated with neurocognitive dysfunction. This study assessed the risk of developing white matter changes (WMC) in breast cancer patients who underwent either WBRT plus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or SRS alone. We retrospectively compared 35 patients with breast cancer brain metastases who received WBRT and SRS to 30 patients who only received SRS. All patients had evaluable imaging at a median of one year after their initial management. The development of white matter T2 prolongation as detected by T2 or FLAIR imaging was graded: grade 1 = little or no white matter T2 hyperintensity; grade 2 = limited periventricular hyperintensity; and grade 3 = diffuse white matter hyperintensity. After WBRT plus SRS, patients demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of WMC (p < 0.0001). After one year, 71.5 % of patients whose treatment included WBRT demonstrated WMC (42.9 % grade 2; 28.6 % grade 3). Only one patient receiving only SRS developed WMC. In long-term survivors of breast cancer, the risk of WMC was significantly reduced when SRS alone was used for management. Further prospective studies are necessary to determine how these findings correlate with neurocognitive toxicity. WBRT usage as initial management of limited brain disease should be replaced by SRS alone to reduce the risk of delayed white matter toxicity.",Excluded

The other 45 patients were all treated by irradiation. 40(89%) patients had bronchogenic carcinoma, three had primaries in other parts of the body and two had unknown primaries. In 16 patients, whole brain was irradiated to a dose of 1000-4000 cGy. Their 6 month survival rate was 25% but all died within one year. In 24 patients, whole brain was first irradiated to 3000-4000 cGy. Then the dose was increased to 5000-6000 cGy by cone down technique. Their 6 month survival was 75%, 1 year survival 33%. The high-dose-cone down method is obviously more effective. In the other 5 patients who were retreated locally for recurrence or new foci in the other parts of the brain, their survival was 4 to 8 months taken from the start of the second course of radiotherapy. One of these five patients is still living as of this writing. Extensive brain necrosis was observed in three patients who received whole brain radiation in the second course.

48,"Incidence of intracranial radiation necrosis following postoperative radiation therapy for sinonasal malignancies OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Surgery and postoperative radiation therapy are commonly used in the treatment of advanced sinonasal cancer. However, post-treatment radiation changes to the brain often mimic radiologic findings suggestive of tumor recurrence, leading to potential unnecessary intracranial biopsies. The objective of this study was to determine clinical factors that predict signs of tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis in post-therapy sinonasal malignancies with intracranial extension.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.METHODS: Twenty-six patients with sinonasal malignancy with intracranial extension underwent surgery and radiation +/- chemotherapy between 2010 and 2014 at the University of Arizona. We analyzed sinonasal cancer type, stage, total radiation dosimetry, time until imaging changes, surgical pathology, associated imaging, and patient demographics.RESULTS: Thirteen of 26 patients had postoperative imaging changes seen on surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Five were deemed to have tumor recurrence due to new metastasis seen on positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan. Four patients were observed with serial imaging that confirmed pseudoprogression. In four patients, there was sufficient concern due to persistent MRI changes, which prompted surgical biopsy, and only one of them was positive for tumor recurrence. Factors that favored tumor recurrence included faster onset of imaging changes on MRI (55 vs. 186 days, P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial tumor recurrence can be difficult to distinguish between radiation necrosis in sinonasal cancers treated with surgery and postoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy. Patients with sub-total resection and rapid onset of MRI changes in postsurveillance scans are more likely to have tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis. Future imaging techniques or tests that investigate tumor biomarkers are necessary to prevent unnecessary biopsies.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 126:2445-2450, 2016.",Excluded

Copper octabromotetracarboranylphenylporphyrin (CuTCPBr), synthesized by bromination of CuTCPH, is one of several new minimally toxic analogues of CuTCPH being studied in our laboratory, which could possess comparable or better tumour-targeting properties with enhanced tumour cytotoxicity. Its biodistribution, biokinetics and toxicity in mice with subcutaneous EMT-6 (mammary) or SCCVII (squamous cell) carcinomas were compared with those of CuTCPH. The administration of approximately 200 mg kg(-1) of either porphyrin in six intraperitoneal injections over 2 days had no apparent effect, but administration of approximately 400 mg kg(-1) slightly lowered body weights, elevated alanine and aspartate transaminase activities in blood plasma, and depressed blood platelet counts for several days. Enzymes and platelets returned to normal within 5 days after those injections and body weights returned to normal within 2 weeks. High average concentrations of boron from either porphyrin were achieved in the two tumour models from a total dose of approximately 200 mg kg(-1). The high tumour boron concentration decreased slowly while concentrations in blood decreased rapidly. Boron concentrations in brain and skin were consistently lower than in tumour by a factor of 10 or more.

Despite this, incurable distant metastases develop within 5 years in 15% of men with very high-risk features. Darolutamide is a structurally distinct oral androgen receptor antagonist with low blood-brain-barrier penetration, a demonstrated favorable safety profile and low potential for drug-drug interactions. Our aim is to determine the efficacy of adding darolutamide to ADT and RT in the setting of either primary definitive therapy, or adjuvant therapy for very high-risk PC. Method(s): This study is a randomized (1:1) phase III placebo-controlled, double-blind trial for men planned for RT who have very high-risk localized PC; or very high-risk features with PSA persistence or rise within one year following RP.

981,"Osteoradionecrosis of the cervical spine resulting from radiotherapy for primary head and neck malignancies: operative and nonoperative management. Case report Osteoradionecrosis is a process of dysvascular bone necrosis and fibrous replacement following exposure to high doses of radiation. The poorly vascularized necrotic tissue may cause pain and/or instability, and it cannot resist infection well, which may result in secondary osteomyelitis. When these processes affect the cervical spine, the resulting instability and neurological deficits can be devastating, and immediate reestablishment of spinal stability is paramount. Reconstruction of the cervical spine can be particularly challenging in this subgroup of patients in whom the spine is poorly vascularized after radical surgery, high-dose irradiation, and infection. The authors report three cases of cervical spine osteoradionecrosis following radiotherapy for primary head and neck malignancies. Two patients suffered secondary osteomyelitis, severe spinal deformity, and spinal cord compression. These patients underwent surgery in which a vascularized fibular graft and instrumentation were used to reconstruct the cervical spine; subsequently hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy was instituted. Fusion occurred, spinal stability was restored, and neurological dysfunction resolved at the 2- and 4-year follow-up examinations, respectively. The third patient experienced pain and dysphagia but did not have osteomyelitis, spinal instability, or neurological deficits. He underwent HBO therapy alone, with improved symptoms and imaging findings. Hyperbaric oxygen is an essential part of treatment for osteoradionecrosis and may be sufficient by itself for uncomplicated cases, but surgery is required for patients with spinal instability, spinal cord compression, and/or infection. A vascularized fibular bone graft is a very helpful adjunct in these patients because it adds little morbidity and may increase the rate of spinal fusion.",Excluded
708,"TopBP1 and Claspin contribute to the radioresistance of lung cancer brain metastases BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is one of the most effective therapeutic tools for brain metastasis. However, it is inevitable that some cancer cells become resistant to radiation. This study is focused on the identification of genes associated with radioresistance in metastatic brain tumor from lung cancer and the functional examination of the selected genes with regards to altered sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation.METHODS: After establishing radioresistant cells from the xenograft model, we explored the significant transcriptional changes by performing DNA microarray profiling. Functional analyses in vitro and in vivo performed to validate the gene responsible for radioresistance.RESULTS: Transcriptional changes induced by radiation therapy are much more extensive in H460 cells than in PC14PE6 cells. The expression levels of TopBP1 and Claspin were increased in the cancer cells that survived radiation therapy. Depletion of TopBP1 or Claspin using shRNA showed an enhancement of sensitivity to radiation in radioresistant lung cancer cells (PC14PE6). Moreover, increased levels of TopBP1 or Claspin endowed cells a higher resistance to radiation. In xenograft models, the knock-down of TopBP1 or Claspin significantly prolonged the median survival time post radiation therapy.CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed the gene expression profiles of the radiosensitive cells and the radioresistant cells to define a set of genes that may be involved in endowing lung cancer cells radioresistance post brain metastasis. Functional analyses indicated that the expression TopBP1 and Claspin positively affects the survival of cancer cells and thus negatively the xenograft metastasis model animals in response to radiation.

Up to 9 days past infection, no differences were seen between immunologically competent and immuno-deficient animals in terms of onset and progression of neurological disease. However, in the latter animals neurological symptoms were dominated by signs of encephalitis instead of paralytic disease as usually seen in immunocompetent animals. Nevertheless, despite high titers of infectious virus in the CNS of immunodeficient animals only mild histopathological changes were noticeable. In contrast, infectious virus in the CNS of immunologically competent animals was below the detection limit of the assay. Paralytic disease and tissue destruction were T lymphocyte mediated because gamma-irradiated rats that were reconstituted by CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte enriched cells in the absence of B lymphocytes revealed an earlier onset of clinical symptoms and a more rapid deterioration of their clinical state compared to fully competent animals. Whereas in CD4+ T cell reconstituted animals infectious virus was moderately reduced and tissue destruction as well as inflammatory changes in the CNS were focal, in CD8+ T cell reconstituted animals vacuolizing white matter inflammation was diffuse without reduction of infectious virus in brain tissue. From the presented data we conclude that in the acute stage of JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis of Lewis rats: (i) tissue destruction and paralytic clinical symptomatology are mainly T cell-mediated; (ii) CD4+ T lymphocytes can directly contribute to reduction of viral load in the brain and (iii) only coordinated action of both, the T and the B cell compartment enables animals to survive the infection and recover from disease.",Excluded

The cohort size was increased by 19% and follow-up extended by 3 years over the previous analysis. Radiation doses were estimated using an updated dosimetry system: Mayak Worker Dosimetry System 2008 (MWDS-2008). For the first time, in an analysis of this cohort, quantitative smoking data were used. Workers of the study cohort were exposed occupationally to prolonged external gamma rays and internal alpha particles. The mean (+/-standard deviation) total dose from external gamma rays was 0.54 +/- 0.76 Gy (95% percentile 2.21 Gy) for males and 0.44 +/- 0.65 Gy (95% percentile 1.87 Gy) for females. The mean plutonium body burden in the 31% of workers monitored for internal exposure was 1.32 +/- 4.87 kBq (95% percentile 4.71 kBq) for males and 2.21 +/- 13.24 kBq (95% percentile 4.56 kBq) for females. The mean total absorbed alpha-particles dose to the liver from incorporated plutonium was 0.23 +/- 0.77 Gy (95% percentile 0.89 Gy) in males and 0.44 +/- 2.11 Gy (95% percentile 1.25 Gy) in females. After adjusting for nonradiation factors (gender, age, calendar period, employment period, facility, smoking, alcohol consumption), there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence associated with total absorbed dose from external gamma rays and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal alpha-particle radiation exposure. Excess relative risks per Gy (ERR/Gy) were 0.46 (95% CI 0.37, 0.57) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.16, 0.42), respectively, based on a linear dose-response model. Adjustments for additional factors (hypertension, body mass index, duration of employment, smoking index and total absorbed dose to the liver from internal exposure during the analysis of external exposure and vice versa) had little effect on the results. The categorical analyses showed that CVD incidence was significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses and that CVD incidence was also significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-particle doses to the liver from incorporated plutonium greater than 0.01 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. The results of the categorical analyses of CVD incidence were in good agreement with a linear dose response for external gamma-ray doses but for internal alpha-particle doses the picture was less clear. For the first time an excess risk of CVD mortality was seen in workers whose livers were exposed to internal alpha-particle doses greater than 0.1 Gy compared to those workers who were exposed to doses of less than 0.01 Gy. A significant increasing trend for CVD mortality with internal alpha-particle dose was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed at doses <1.0 Gy after having adjusted for nonradiation factors, ERR/Gy = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.09, 1.92). These updated results provide good evidence for a linear trend in risk of CVD incidence with external gamma-ray dose. The trend for CVD incidence with internal alpha-particle dose is less clear due to the impact of issues concerning the use of dose estimates based on below the limit of detection bioassay measurements.",Included

The aim of this study is to assess the appropriate timing of WBRT for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and brain metastases (BM).METHODS: There were 78 patients diagnosed with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and BM in Beijing Chest Hospital between August 2009 and May 2015. 48 untreated patients who received both WBRT and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy. Prognostic factors of intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were identified by Cox proportional hazards modeling.RESULTS: Intracranial objective response rate was 81.3% and disease control rate was 93.8%. Median intracranial PFS was 10 months. Median OS was 18 months. Multivariate analysis of intracranial PFS revealed that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1 (HR=30.436, 95%CI: 4.721-196.211, P<0.001) and early WBRT (HR=3.663, 95%CI: 1.657-8.098, P=0.001) had a better intracranial PFS.

RESULT(S): Regression and stabilization of the tumor was achieved in 84.3% of all cases. Complications of different type and intensity associated with brachytherapy I125 were observed in majority of the cases. The complications observed were: radiation retinopathy (52%), radiation maculopathy (33.6%), radiation optic neuropathy (25.3%), vitreous hemorrhage (8.8%), glaucoma (20.5%) and cataract (18.5%). CONCLUSION(S): 125I brachytherapy yields good results in cases of uveal melanoma, however it's associated with post radiation complications.",Excluded
1004,"Screening of a large panel of gastrointestinal peptide plasma levels is not adapted for the evaluation of digestive damage following irradiation The aim of this study was to assess the potential of gastrointestinal peptide plasma levels as biomarkers of radiation-induced digestive tract damage. To this end, plasma levels of substance P, GRP, motilin, PYY, somatostatin-28, gastrin, and neurotensin were followed for up to 5 days in pigs after a 16-Gy whole-body X-irradiation, completed by a histopathological study performed at 5 days. Each peptide gave a specific response to irradiation. The plasma levels of GRP and substance P were not modified by irradiation exposure; neither were those of motilin and PYY. Concerning gastrin, a 2-3-fold increase of plasma concentration was observed in pig, which presented the most important histological alterations of the stomach. The plasma levels of somatostatin, unchanged from 1 to 4 days after irradiation, was also increased by 130% at 5 days. In contrast, a diminution of neurotensin plasma levels was noted, firstly at 1 day (-88%), and from 3 days after exposure (-50%). The present study suggested that changes in gastrin and neurotensin plasma levels were associated with structural alterations of the stomach and ileum, respectively, indicating that they may be relevant biological indicators of radiation-induced digestive damage to these segments.",Included
2055,"Time resolved dosimetry of human brain exposed to low frequency pulsed magnetic fields An accurate dosimetry is a key issue to understanding brain stimulation and related interaction mechanisms with neuronal tissues at the basis of the increasing amount of literature revealing the effects on human brain induced by low-level, low frequency pulsed magnetic fields (PMFs). Most literature on brain dosimetry estimates the maximum E field value reached inside the tissue without considering its time pattern or tissue dispersivity. Nevertheless a time-resolved dosimetry, accounting for dispersive tissues behavior, becomes necessary considering that the threshold for an effect onset may vary depending on the pulse waveform and that tissues may filter the applied stimulatory fields altering the predicted stimulatory waveform's size and shape. In this paper a time-resolved dosimetry has been applied on a realistic brain model exposed to the signal presented in Capone et al (2009 J. Neural Transm. 116 257-65), accounting for the broadband dispersivity of brain tissues up to several kHz, to accurately reconstruct electric field and current density waveforms inside different brain tissues. The results obtained by exposing the Duke's brain model to this PMF signal show that the E peak in the brain is considerably underestimated if a simple monochromatic dosimetry is carried out at the pulse repetition frequency of 75 Hz.",Excluded
260,Ultrasonic investigations of the soleus muscle after space flight on the Biosputnik 936 The study was aimed at quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the muscle fibres and the axonal endings of the neuromuscular junctions in the soleus muscle of animals after a space flight on Biosputnik 936. Ultrastructural morphometric studies of the muscle fibres demonstrated diminished volume of sarcomer and accumulation of glycogen granules. The mean number of mitochondrial profiles decreased. The investigations of the axonal endings of the neuromuscular junctions in the soleus muscle showed diminution of the mean number of synaptic vesicles and swelling of the mitochondria. This changing in the fibres and axonal endings we can interpret as the first step of degeneration.,Included
258,"Partial mitochondrial inhibition causes striatal dopamine release suppression and medium spiny neuron depolarization via H2O2 elevation, not ATP depletion Mitochondrial dysfunction is a potential causal factor in Parkinson's disease. We show here that acute exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone (30-100 nM; 30 min) causes concentration-dependent suppression of single-pulse evoked dopamine (DA) release monitored in real time with carbon-fiber microelectrodes in guinea pig striatal slices, with no effect on DA content. Suppression of DA release was prevented by the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, implicating ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels; however, tissue ATP was unaltered. Because KATP channels can be activated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as by low ATP, we examined the involvement of rotenone-enhanced H2O2 generation. Confirming an essential role for H2O2, the inhibition of DA release by rotenone was prevented by catalase, a peroxide-scavenging enzyme. Striatal H2O2 generation during rotenone exposure was examined in individual medium spiny neurons using fluorescence imaging with dichlorofluorescein (DCF). An increase in intracellular H2O2 levels followed a similar time course to that of DA release suppression and was accompanied by cell membrane depolarization, decreased input resistance, and increased excitability. Extracellular catalase markedly attenuated the increase in DCF fluorescence and prevented rotenone-induced effects on membrane properties; membrane changes were also largely prevented by flufenamic acid, a blocker of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Thus, partial mitochondrial inhibition can cause functional DA denervation via H2O2 and KATP channels, without DA or ATP depletion. Furthermore, amplified H2O2 levels and TRP channel activation in striatal spiny neurons indicate potential sources of damage in these cells. Overall, these novel factors could contribute to parkinsonian motor deficits and neuronal degeneration caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.",Excluded

We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation to induce surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo, to assess their suitability as vascular targets in irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",Included
690,"Cardiotoxicity of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Patients with Lung Cancer Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activate the host immune system to target cancer cells. However, the unchecked systemic inflammatory response may result in cardiovascular immune-related adverse events, as myocarditis, pericardial disease, stress-induced, and dilated cardiomyopathy are increasingly reported in case series and pharmacovigilance databases. We sought to further investigate ICI-related cardiotoxicity in a cohort of patients with lung cancer. Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary lung cancer treated with ICIs or non-ICI systemic therapy over three years to assess the likelihood of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Data was collected on co-morbidities, cardiovascular medications, past or concurrent radiation or systemic therapies, serum troponin, brain natriuretic peptide levels, pre- and post-treatment electrocardiograms, echocardiography, angiography, and total ICI dose. Each factor was compared between patients treated with ICIs and non-ICI systemic therapy. Result(s): We included 252 patients in our study. During a median follow-up of 6 months (interquartile range: 2-14 months), patients treated with ICIs (n = 135) who had a troponin elevation were more likely to sustain a MACE (hazard ratio: 6.9, 95% confidence interval: 3.2-15, p <0.001) with a median time to event of 33 days (Figure 1). Discussion(s): Patients with lung cancer on ICIs are more likely to incur a troponin elevation compared to patients on conventional chemotherapy. Elevated troponin is associated with an increased likelihood of MACE, especially early during treatment with ICIs. This data supports closer monitoring, including serial troponin measurements during the early phase of ICI therapy. Copyright © 2019",Excluded
2343,"Extremely low frequency magnetic field induced changes in motor behaviour of gerbils submitted to global cerebral ischemia The purpose of this study was to evaluate behavioural effects of an extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) in 3-month-old Mongolian gerbils submitted to global cerebral ischemia. After 10-min occlusion of both common carotid arteries, the gerbils were placed in the vicinity of an electromagnet and continuously exposed to ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) for 7 days. Their behaviour (locomotion, stereotypy, rotations, and immobility) was monitored on days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 after reperfusion for 60min in the open field. It was shown that the 10-min global cerebral ischemia per se induced a significant motor activity increase (locomotion, stereotypy and rotations), and consequently immobility decrease until day 4 after reperfusion, compared to control gerbils. Exposure to ELF-MF inhibited development of ischemia-induced motor hyperactivity during the whole period of registration, but significantly in the first 2 days after reperfusion, when the postischemic hyperactivity was most evident. Motor activity of these gerbils was still significantly increased compared to control ones, but only on day 1 after reperfusion. Our results revealed that the applied ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) decreased motor hyperactivity induced by the 10-min global cerebral ischemia, via modulation of the processes that underlie this behavioural response.",Excluded

The cells were irradiated with a neuron beam using the accelerator-based epithermal neuron source. A clonogenic assay was used to evaluate the viability of the irradiated cells. The absorbed doses obtained from elastic scattering of fast neutrons by substance nuclei and the doses obtained from boron neutron capture were calculated using the NMS code. The absorbed doses of gamma-radiation were measured with a mixed radiation dosimeter.Results: The viability of boron-containing and intact human U251 and T98G cell lines and Chinese hamster CHO-K1 and V-79 cells was analyzed after neutron beam radiation. Irradiation of all four cell lines were cultured in the presence of 10B was shown to reduce their colony-forming capacity compared with the control. Elevated boron levels in the culture medium resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of survived cells. Radiation had the most pronounced impact on the proliferative capacity of the human U251 glioma cell lines.Conclusion: The cultures of human tumor cells and mammalian cells demonstrated that the neutron beam formed with the accelerator-based epithermal neutron source designed at the INP, was effective in reducing the viability of tumor cells in the presence of 10B.",Excluded

831,"Optimised GMP-compliant production of [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 on the Trasis AllinOne module Background: The translocator protein 18 kDa is recognised as an important biomarker for neuroinflammation due to its soaring expression in microglia. This process is common for various neurological disorders. DPA-714 is a potent TSPO-specific ligand which found its use in Positron Emission Tomography following substitution of fluorine-19 with fluorine-18, a positron-emitting radionuclide. [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 enables visualisation of inflammatory processes in vivo non-invasively. Radiolabelling of this tracer is well described in literature, including validation for clinical use. Here, we report significant enhancements to the process which resulted in the design of a fully GMP-compliant robust synthesis of [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 on a popular cassette-based system, Trasis AllinOne, boosting reliability, throughput, and introducing a significant degree of simplicity. Result(s): [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 was synthesised using the classic nucleophilic aliphatic substitution on a good leaving group, tosylate, with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoride using tetraethylammonium bicarbonate in acetonitrile at 100<sup></sup>C. The process was fully automated on a Trasis AllinOne synthesiser using an in-house designed cassette and sequence. With a relatively small precursor load of 4 mg, [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 was obtained with consistently high radiochemical yields of 55-71% (n=6) and molar activities of 117-350 GBq/micromol at end of synthesis.

Mean age of the persons was 41. Vegetative dystonia syndrome was diagnosticated in 50% of examined subjects. The increased perception and pain thresholds, as well as the thresholds' asymmetry were determined in 30% of patients. The conduction velocity of sensory and motor nerves, as well as the neuromuscular transmission were normal. No substantial changes in parameters of the soleus H- and M-responses were detected. A decreased amplitude and increased latency of the evoked skin sympathetic potential were found indicating a decreased tone of the adrenergic sympathetic vasoconstrictors and cholinergic sudomotor fibres, that may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of the sensory, vegetotrophovascular disorders for these subjects. Decreased activity of the sympathetic autonomic system causes permanent course of the vegetative dystonia syndrome and more seldom the parasympathetic autonomic paroxysms. A decreased tone of the sympathetic autonomic system may be due to the monoaminergic neuromediation inhibition (decreased noradrenaline and dopamine excretion for the same subjects), that can induce psychoemotional disorders, depression and sleep-wakeness cycle disorders.",Included

The effect of BI on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is not fully understood. Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of BI on HPA axis responses under basal and stressful conditions as well as following pretreatment with dexamethasone (Dex). Method(s): Adult male rats were exposed to whole BI. HPA axis responses were examined at 2, 4, 9 and 20 weeks after BI. Histological evaluations of the irradiated rats and matched controls were conducted at 4 and 20 weeks after BI. Result(s): In contrast to the control group, the basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels were enhanced at 9 and 20 weeks after BI and the inhibitory effect of Dex was reduced. BI also caused hyposuppression of the adrenocortical response to stress. Histological assessment of the irradiated brains revealed hippocampal atrophy at 20 weeks after BI. The neuronal counts were lower only in the CA1 region of the irradiated brains. BI caused a decrease in the binding capacity of Dex to the hippocampal cytosolic fraction. Conclusion(s): Enhanced stress-induced HPA axis responses and the reduced effect of Dex suggest that BI has delayed effects on HPA axis responses as manifested by impairment of the negative feedback exerted by glucocorticoids (GCs). The mechanisms underlying these effects of BI are unknown. It is possible that the marked BI-induced damage in the hippocampus, which plays an important role in the regulation of the feedback effect of GCs, may cause abnormal HPA axis responses following BI. © 2012 S.

This same training can be used to image other body regions, such as the abdomen, enabling clinicians to screen for abdominal disease using cross sectional imaging without the need for anesthesia and without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation.

Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed all 3T MRS, DSC and DWI studies performed for suspicion of malignant glioma recurrence between October 2006 and December 2008. Maximum Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr peak-area and peak-height ratios were recorded for both multi-voxel and single-voxel MRS. Maximum cerebral blood volume (CBV) and minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were normalized to white matter. Histopathology and clinical-radiologic follow-up served as reference standards. Receiver operating characteristic curves for each parameter were compared. Result(s): Forty lesions were classified as glioma recurrence (n = 30) or posttreatment effect (n = 10). Diagnostic performance was similar for CBV ratio (AUC = 0.917, P < 0.001), multi-voxel Cho/Cr peak-area (AUC = 0.913, P = 0.002), and multi-voxel Cho/NAA peak-height (AUC = 0.913, P = 0.002), while ADC ratio (AUC = 0.726, P = 0.035) did not appear to perform as well. Single-voxel MRS parameters did not reliably distinguish tumor recurrence from posttreatment effects. Conclusion(s): A 3T DSC and multi-voxel MRS Cho/Cr peak-area and Cho/NAA peak-height appear to outperform DWI for distinguishing glioma recurrence from posttreatment effects.

The success of FUS brain-drug delivery relies on its integration with in-vivo imaging to monitor kinetic change of therapeutic molecules into the brain. In this study, we developed a dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) technique for kinetic analysis of delivered molecules during FUS-BBB opening. Three kinetic parameters (K<inf>trans</inf>, V<inf>e</inf>, K<inf>ep</inf>) were characterized dynamically to describe BBB-permeability at two FUS exposure conditions (0.4 or 0.8 MPa) over 24 h. K<inf>trans</inf>, defined as the influx volume transfer constant from plasma to EES, and V<inf>e</inf>, the EES volume fraction, were both found to be pressure-dependent. K<inf>trans</inf> and V<inf>e</inf> showed a peak increase of 0.0086-0.0131 min<sup>- 1</sup> (for 0.4-0.8 MPa pressure), and 0.0431-0.0692, respectively, immediately after FUS exposure. Both parameters subsequently decreased exponentially as a function of time, with estimated half-lives of decay of 2.89-5.3 and 2.2-4.93 h, respectively. The kinetics of K<inf>ep</inf>, defined as the efflux rate constant from the extracellular extravascular space (EES) to the plasma, were complementary to K <inf>trans</inf>, with an initial decrease from 0.2010 to 0.1901 min <sup>- 1</sup> followed by a significantly longer recovery time (half-life of 17.39-99.92 h). Our observations strongly supported the existence of imbalanced and mismatched kinetics of influx (K<inf>trans</inf>) and efflux (K <inf>ep</inf>) between the plasma and EES, indicating the existence of directional permeability during FUS-BBB opening. We further showed that kinetic change determined by DCE-MRI correlated well with the concentration of Evans Blue (EB)-albumin (coefficient of 0.74-0.89). These findings suggest that MRI kinetic monitoring may serve as an alternative method for in-vivo monitoring of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) change of therapeutic agents during drug delivery to the brain, and provide useful information for future optimization of FUS-BBB opening. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

Previous studies have usually focused on the location of these vascular markers and did not consider the concomitant effect by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In this study, we aimed to find dose-dependent effects of these MRI markers on regional cortical thinning and white matter tract damage in VCI patients, considering the effect by concomitant AD pathology. Method(s): Participants consisted of 65 patients with mild cognitive impairment associated with small-vessel disease (svMCI) and 69 with subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). Conventional brain MRI scans, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and PIB PET were performed. WMH, lacunes, microbleeds, and PIB retention amount were measured. Multiple regression analyses were used to elucidate the relationship between regional cortical thickness, DTI abnormalities, and each small vessel vascular marker, adjusting the effects by demographic factors and PIB retention amount. Result(s): Higher WMH volume was associated with cortical thinning in bilateral cingulate cortices, right insular cortex, and left lingual gyrus. More lacunes were associated with cortical thinning in the right medial and superior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Microbleeds were not related with regional cortical thinning. Higher PIB retention was associated with cortical thinning in left medial temporal lobe. Independent of other vascular markers and PIB retention amount, larger WMH volume was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in widespread periventricular white matter region. Regardless of PIB retention amount, more lacunes were associated with decreased FA in bilateral posterior and anterior corona radiata, right anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral posterior limb of internal capsule, and bilateral precuneus. Microbleeds had association with decreased FA in the bilateral posterior corona radiata and optic radiation. PIB retention amount was not related with regional FA decrease.

3219,"The analgesic effect of low dose focal irradiation in a mouse model of bone cancer is associated with spinal changes in neuro-mediators of nociception Despite the widespread use of radiotherapy to treat painful bone metastases, the mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of low dose ionizing radiation is unknown. Bone cancer pain is mostly associated with an inflammatory response dominated by local activation of osteoclasts and by astrogliosis in the spinal cord. We determined the effects of a 6 Gy irradiation given focally on osteolytic sarcoma cells inoculated in humeri of mice. Pain behavior was assessed using the rota-rod and the grip force test. Seven days post-irradiation (day 17 post-tumor implantation) the performance of mice markedly improved on the rotarod (non-irradiated, 67+/-16s vs irradiated, 223 +/- 22 s; P = 0.0005), and the grip force test (non-irradiated, 34 +/- 4 g vs irradiated, 55 +/- 2 g; P = 0.001). This improvement was similar to the analgesia achieved with 30 mg/kg of the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ketorolac (Rota-rod, 67 +/- 16 s vs 178 +/- 35 s; P = 0.01: grip force test, 34 +/- 4 g, vs 60 +/- 5 g; P = 0.003). Following irradiation, the tumor mass and the number of osteoclasts did not decrease while the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) increased. Tumor irradiation led to clear differences in the spinal cord. These include a decrease in glial activity (astrocytes and microglial cells) as well as pain mediators such as dynorphin, COX-2 and chemotactic cytokine receptor (CCR2).

Among them, 37 patients were treated using posterior open surgery, and 35 patients received mini-open operation via Wiltse approach. Crew placement accuracy rate, operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage, postoperative hospitalization time, radiation exposure time, postoperative improvement in R value, Cobb's angle and visual analog scale (VAS) scores of the two methods were compared. There were no significant differences in the accuracy rate of pedicle screw placement, radiation exposure and postoperative R value and Cobb's angle improvement between the two groups. However, the mini-open method had obvious advantages over the conventional open method in operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage, postoperative hospitalization time, and postoperative improvement in VAS. The mini-open pedicle screw technique could be applied in treatment of single-segment thoracolumbar fracture without neurologic injury and had advantages of less tissue trauma, short operative and rehabilitative time on the premise of guaranteed accuracy rate and no increased radiation exposure.",Excluded

1413,"Successful prevention from acute rejection in human hand allograft. [Chinese] Aim: To explore the prevention of acute rejection in human band allograft. Method(s): Two male patients underwent right hand allograft in the Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University on 21st September 1999. In the two patients, the right hand of one was exploded when exploding the fish and underwent initially fitting; the right wrist of the other was carved by steel-wire and underwent fitting after the failure replantation two years ago. On 26th September 2000, another patient with traumatic both forearms amputation underwent the hand allograft, whose both forearms were injured in explosion one year ago, with deletion in 1/3 middle and lower of the right forearm and 1/3 middle and upper of the left forearm. The 3 patients had normal psychological and immune state without systemic disease, and their disabled limb condition was better, which requested urgently hand allograft. Three brain-dead donors were matched respectively to ABO- and Rh-compatible, HIA-half compatible. After removed the marrow of ulnar and radial bone by scraping, two of the donor's arms was irrigated with 8 Gy X-ray; The artery, vein and nerve of the patients were anastomosed under microscope combined with immunosuppressants. T-lymphocyte subsets and cytokine were dynamically detected. Result(s):(1) General condition, transplanted hand skin and histopathologic examination of the patients: After transplantation, the vital signs were stable, and the circulation of the transplanted hands was satisfactory. No bacteria, virus or fungal infection were found. The skin healing was fused with the replanted limb, all the grafted hands survived. No acute rejection reaction was found in the clinical symptoms, physical signs and skin pathologic examination.(2) Dynamic detection of cytokine in peripheral blood: The level of serum interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor ot(TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma(IFN-gamma) were descent quickly within the first post-transplantation week and returned at induction period of inummosuppressive agent, but remained at low level. Conclusion(s): Tissue matching with donor, reasonable handle of donor limbs, individualized inummosupressants, refined and exact microsurgical technology, and effective infection prevention can prevent acute rejection. Monitoring of serum IL-2, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in the peripheral blood of patients is helpful to judge the occurrence of acute rejection.",Excluded
525,"Cognitive Impairments in Subjects Exposed to Radiation during Prenatal Development Objective. To evaluate cognitive status in subjects exposed to ionizing radiation during antenatal development. Materials and methods. A total of 77 subjects with antenatal exposure to radiation were studied, along with a reference group of 73 subjects living in radiologically unpolluted territories in the Chelyabinsk region. Clinical, clinical psychological (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (WAIS), and proverb interpretation) neurophysiological (EEG), and laboratory (cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoproteins triglycerides, cortisol, melatonin) methods were used. Results and discussion. These investigations showed that a significantly greater proportion of subjects exposed to radiation during antenatal development had nonpsychotic mental disorders with a predominance of organic mental impairments (cognitive and asthenic). Neurophysiological studies identified more profound abnormalities in brain bioelectrical activity with pathological rhythms and a predominance of the theta rhythm among those exposed to radiation. Clinical psychological study data identified a significant decrease in analytical-synthetic ability in irradiated subjects, along with lower general and verbal IQ levels. These changes were accompanied by higher cortisol and melatonin levels, supporting activation of and tension in the mechanisms of adaptation in subjects irradiated during antenatal development.

2034,"Benefts of head tilting for brain PET-CT examinations The main goal of the current study is to think over the aspects of head positioning for brain examinations, focusing on mainly one field of view (FOV) PET/CT acquisitions. The image quality, radiation exposure of the eye lenses, streaking artefact due to the beam hardening of the skull, patient comfort, orientation of the reconstructed images were all considered in this study. Method(s): while the brain centered in the PET field of view, the degree of tilting the patient's chin toward to the chest were examined. Reconstructed CT images of anonymized patients were retrospectively evaluated. From the perspective of PET image quality the PET FOV on the CT image were simulated, then the number of significant voxels of the brain tissue close to the FOV boarders were plotted as a function of the tilt angle. On the same way the path of the radiation exposure in the brain were analysed. We introduced a simple wedge-shape insert placed under the head holder into our routine brain examinations according to our initial results. Patients were reported in connection with the comfort during the examination. Result(s): we found that the range of 20-25 degree is the optimal range to tilt the head toward to the chest. As a result of tilting the head, the reconstructed axial slices for both the CT and the PET are ft for supra orbito-meatalis line. It decreases the asymmetries caused by wrong orientation, and can take unnecessary the reorientation of the images as a post-processing step, prior the medical reporting. In most cases it results that the eyes are out of the CT scan range, which is particularly important, since the eyes have high risk for radiation exposure. The location of CT streaking artefacts moves down to the direction of cerebellum. In general because the tilting of the head, the perpendicular projection of the brain to the scan axis is significantly shorter, which means 10-15% dose reduction. Furthermore the noise-as a result of the low sensitivity of PET on the FOV boarders-has smaller effect on the diagnostic value of reconstructed PET image. There is no noticeable advantage or disadvantage related to the patient comfort. Conclusion(s): tilting the head with 20-25 degree results an overall improvement in image quality and dose reduction. Our results are relevant not for PET/CT only, but for SPECT/CT examination too.",Excluded

1035,"Intraoperative radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for stage II/III rectal carcinoma In recent years, many efforts have focused on combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as adjuvants to curative surgery in patients with stage II and III (UICC) rectal carcinomas. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) makes it possible to increase the total irradiation dose in a locally restricted area while sparing normal mobile organs, but it is limited by increased late toxicity. A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients. No radiation colitis or neuropathy occurred. Moderate-dose IORT and EBRT is safe, taking into account related late toxicities. It is an effective local treatment approach, resulting in an encouraging local control rate.",Excluded
2298,"Interaction between age of irradiation and age of testing in the disruption of operant performance using a ground-based model for exposure to cosmic rays Previous research has shown a progressive deterioration in cognitive performance in rats exposed to (56)Fe particles as a function of age. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of age of irradiation independently of the age of testing. Male Fischer-344 rats, 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age, were exposed to 25-200 cGy of (56)Fe particles (1,000 MeV/n). Following irradiation, the rats were trained to make an operant response on an ascending fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule. When performance was evaluated as a function of both age of irradiation and testing, the results showed a significant effect of age on the dose needed to produce a performance decrement, such that older rats exposed to lower doses of (56)Fe particles showed a performance decrement compared to younger rats. When performance was evaluated as a function of age of irradiation with the age of testing held constant, the results indicated that age of irradiation was a significant factor influencing operant responding, such that older rats tested at similar ages and exposed to similar doses of (56)Fe particles showed similar performance decrements. The results are interpreted as indicating that the performance decrement is not a function of age per se, but instead is dependent upon an interaction between the age of irradiation, the age of testing, and exposure to HZE particles. The nature of these effects and how age of irradiation affects cognitive performance after an interval of 15 to 16 months remains to be established.",Included

The liver cancer cells of human being and the brain tissue of animals were investigated with the method of fluorescent mark and isotope tracing. The fluorescencence intensity and radioactivity intensity, which express the concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, were measured with the laser scanning confocal microscope and liquid scintillation counter.

The modulation waves have the same frequency with the ELF waves; (3) The distribution law of window effects is f<inf>n</inf> = (2n + 1)f<inf>c</inf>(n=0, 1,2), where, f<inf>n</inf> is the nth window frequency and f<inf>c</inf> is the basal frequency (the lowest window frequency), and the law is right in the frequency region 0 ~ 135Hz, in which the basal frequency is 15 ~ 16Hz; (4) The window bio-effects can only be produced in the specific frequency and specific intensity of EMW, in other words, the window effects is a dual function of the frequency and the intensity of the EMW.",Excluded
2984,"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236+/-9 mum and GC: 215+/-5 mum) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4+/-1.6 mum; GC: 12.2+/-1.2 mum). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4+/-0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4+/-0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.",Included
963,"The mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus reduces cell proliferation and enhances radiosensitivity of primary meningioma cells irradiated by photons or carbon ions-preliminary results Background. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) was found to be dysregulated in various cancers and an association of the activation of mTORC1 with meningioma and schwannoma growth was reported. The pharmaceutical inhibition of mTOR was identified as a potential strategy for the augmentation of radiation-induced cell damages in different cancers although the detailed molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. Furthermore as mTOR inhibitors particularly show suppression of double-strand break repair a role for a combined therapy by mTOR-inhibitors and carbon ion irradiation is to hypothesize. Our aim was to analyse the effect of the mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus alone and in combination with irradiation by photons or carbon ions in primary human meningioma cells. Methods. Tumour specimens from 6 patients suffering from meningiomas, 4 with WHO Grad I and 2 with WHO Grade II, were obtained after surgical resection from the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Saarland, Homburg/Saar, Germany, plated on tissue culture plates and cultured under standard conditions as previously described. Primary cells up to passage 7 were treated with irradiation by carbon ions (0.125 to 2 Gy) or photons (0.5 to 8 Gy) alone and in combination with Temsirolimus (0.5 to 2 muM). Furthermore meningioma cells were treated with Temsirolimus alone (0.5 to 5 muM). Cell proliferation was measured by counting cells 6 days after treatment. Results. A dose-dependent reduction of meningioma cells was observed after irradiation by photons as well as by carbon ions. The biological impact on cell reduction after irradiation by carbon ions seems to be four times stronger in comparison to irradiation by photons. The treatment with Temsirolimus alone in a concentration up to 5 muM causes a cell reduction of 69% in benign WHO Grade I meningioma cells whereas WHO Grade II meningioma cells were only reduced by 31%. The combination of irradiation and Temsirolimus in concentrations up to 2 muM effects a further cell reduction for both carbon ions (0.5 Gy) and photons (2 Gy) up to 30% in comparisons to irradiation alone. Conclusion. Our study shows promising preliminary results regarding the antiproliferative effect on meningioma cells by mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus alone and as a radiosensitizer in combination with irradiation by photons or carbon ions.

3042,"Combining low-dose whole brain radiation with radioimmunotherapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma Purpose/Objective(s): Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B-cell disorder that initially responds well to therapy, but a majority of patients relapse within 2 years. High-dose whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was once the primary treatment, but eventual relapses and late neurocognitive sequelae were frequently observed. The addition of CNS-directed chemotherapy to WBRT improved duration of response, with a concomitant increase in neurocognitive problems. More recently, medical oncologists have attempted to avoid radiation altogether, with similar clinical responses as seen with WBRT alone. The addition of rituximab has yielded little improvement due to the poor efficiency (<1%) of the antibody to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). WBRT has been shown to temporarily disrupt the BBB permeability to macromolecules for several hours.We hypothesized that adjuvant low-dose WBRT followed by anti-CD20-directed radioimmunotherapy (RIT) may allow for specific dose escalation to areas of tumor cells while avoiding extra dose to uninvolved areas of the brain, decreasing the chance for significant neurocognitive deficits. Materials/Methods: Four patients (71F, 69M, 48F, 53M) with PCNSL (3 relapsed, 1 newly diagnosed) were treated with low-dose (18 Gy in 10 fractions) WBRT,with 90Yibritumomab tiuxetan RIT given immediately after the final WBRT fraction. None of the patients had previously received radiation therapy.Median RIT dosewas 24.5 (21.8-32) mCi. All patients were restaged with contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain at 3 months, and every 3 months following. At baseline and at each follow-up visit, neurocognition was tested and family members were asked about subjective changes. Result(s): All four patients obtained a complete response to chemotherapy + low-dose WBRT + RIT. After a median follow-up of 17.5 (12-20) months, no relapses have been observed. No decline in neurocognitive function (objective or subjective) has been seen; in fact, improvement was seen in 3 patients. All patients tolerated the regimen well, with the typical transient decline and recovery of blood counts seen with RIT. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant low-dose WBRT and RIT following CNS-directed chemotherapy appears to be safe in this small sample. Complete responses were seen in all patients, and this appears to be durable compared to standard PCNSL salvage therapies. No neurocognitive deficits were seen following this novel radiation therapy regimen. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",Excluded

In this case-control study, we define the effect of prior hemorrhage on AVM radiosurgery outcomes. Method(s): From a prospective, institutional database of 1400 AVM patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, unruptured and ruptured AVMs were matched in a 1:1 fashion, blinded to outcome, based on patient demographics, prior embolization, AVM size (mean volume of unruptured AVMs 3.7 cm3 versus ruptured AVMs 3.5 cm3, P=0.195), Spetzler-Martin grade and radiosurgical treatment parameters (mean prescription dose for unruptured AVMs 20.9 Gy versus ruptured AVMs 21.0 Gy, P=0.837). There were 270 patients in each cohort. Matched statistical analyses were used to compare the baseline characteristics, obliteration rates, post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage risks, and incidences of radiation-induced changes (RIC) between the two cohorts. Result(s): The actuarial obliteration rates of the two cohorts were similar (unruptured AVMs: 38%, 58%, 76% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 40%, 60%, 73% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.592). However, for embolized AVMs, complete obliteration was more likely to be achieved in unruptured lesions (unruptured AVMs: 25%, 32%, 54% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; ruptured AVMs: 18%, 27%, 42% at 3, 5, 10 years, respectively; P=0.038). Prior AVM rupture resulted in a higher annual risk of post-radiosurgery latency period hemorrhage (ruptured AVMs 2.3% versus unruptured AVMs 1.1%, P=0.025) but a lower rate of cumulative and symptomatic RIC (cumulative RIC: ruptured AVMs 30.4% versus unruptured AVMs 48.9%, P<0.0001; symptomatic RIC: ruptured AVMs 7.0% versus unruptured AVMs 12.2%, P=0.041, respectively). The rates of permanent RIC were similar between the unruptured (2.2%) and ruptured (1.9%) AVM cohorts (P=0.761). Conclusion(s): Prior AVM rupture significantly alters the risk of latency period hemorrhage and RIC following radiosurgery. These effects should be taken into consideration with the multidisciplinary management of AVM patients.",Excluded
717,"Pain flare following external beam radiotherapy and meaningful change in pain scores in the treatment of bone metastases BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To examine the incidence of pain flare following external beam radiotherapy and to determine what constitutes a meaningful change in pain scores in the treatment of bone metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases treated with external beam radiotherapy were asked to score their pain on a scale of 0-10 before the treatment (baseline), daily during the treatment and for 10 days after completion of external beam radiation. Pain flare was defined as a two-point increase from baseline pain in the pain scale of 0-10 with no decrease in analgesic intake or a 25% increase in analgesic intake employing daily oral morphine equivalent with no decrease in pain score. To distinguish pain flare from progression of pain, we required the pain score and analgesic intake to return back to baseline levels after the increase/flare. They were also asked to indicate if their pain changed during that time compared to pre-treatment level. The change in pain score was compared with patient perception.RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were evaluated in this study. There were 49 male and 39 female patients with the median age of 70 years. Twelve of 88 patients (14%) had pain flare on day 1. The overall incidence of pain flare during the study period ranged from 2 to 16%. A total of 797 pain scorings were obtained. Patients perceived an improvement in pain when their self-reported pain score decreased by at least two points.CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the occurrence of pain flare following the external beam radiotherapy in the treatment of bone metastases. Further studies are required to predict who are at risk for flare. Appropriate measures can be taken to alleviate the pain flare. The finding in the meaningful change in pain scores supports the investigator-defined partial response used in some clinical trials.",Excluded

TRH deficiency leads to abnormal glycosylation of TSH alpha and beta subunits and loss of the normal circadian pattern of TSH secretion (low in the afternoon, a surge in the evening, higher at night). This disruption results in either mixed hypothyroidism (raised TSH with abnormal secretory kinetics) or central hypothyroidism (abnormal secretory kinetics without raised TSH). Although primary hypothyroidism is more common in the general population and cancer survivors, the cumulative incidence of central and mixed hypothyroidism is high during the ten years after cranial irradiation. Monitoring for decline in free thyroxine (FT(4)) and rise in serum TSH, and early recognition using TSH surge and TRH tests, are clinically valuable.

2919,"Perceptual costs for motion transparency evaluated by two performance measures Transparency perception is recognized as one of the important phenomena to understand the computational mechanism of early visual system. Transparency perception indicates that a simple theory reconstructing a single-valued field of a visual attribute, such as an optical-flow field, cannot model the neural mechanism for the human visual system and raises a fundamental issue of how visual attributes are represented and detected in the brain. It is considered that one of the important cues to reveal the neural encoding mechanism for overlapping surfaces is the perceptual cost in transparency perception. It has been known that the perceptual performance in motion transparency is worse than that expected from single motion perception. This perceptual ""cost"" would reflect the encoding strategy for transparent motions. Here we present a systematic study comparing the perceptual costs in motion transparency evaluated by two performance measures. The result showed that the properties of the perceptual costs varied with the performance measures. The perceptual cost evaluated by the motion detection threshold became smaller as a directional difference between overlapping motions increased, whereas the cost examined with the precision of directional judgments became worse. A computational analysis suggests that these contradictory results cannot be explained by a simple population coding model for motion directions.",Excluded

Each WOF gave rise to an increase in IOS, measured with a straylight meter, of between 10% and 200% from baseline and ranging in effect from normal ageing to significant cataract. The change in sensitivity from baseline was normalized, allowing comparison of standardized (z) scores (change divided by the standard deviation of normative values) for each instrument.RESULTS: Average SAP, FDT, and FDF thresholds were significantly affected (P < 0.001) by moderate to large increases in IOS (50%-200%), whereas MDT remained largely unaffected over the same range of straylight levels.CONCLUSIONS: The Moorfields MDT shows greater resilience to the effects of additional straylight compared with SAP, FDT, or FDF.",Excluded
1201,"Relationship between dose and the latent period for radiation myelopathy in rats A 1-cm segment of rat cervical spinal cord was irradiated (16-150 Gy) and the animals were followed for 16 months to determine the dose-response relationship for the latent period for radiation myelopathy. The latent period was found to be dependent on dose in the ED0 to ED100 dose range, independent of dose in the range ED100 to 1.5 times the ED100 dose and dependent on dose for doses more than 1.5 times the ED100 dose. Histologically, some vascular injury and demyelinization were observed in the irradiated cord segment of all paretic animals. In the first dose-dependent region there was a bimodal distribution of latent periods, suggesting two mechanisms for paralysis in this dose region. A hypothesis based on glial and vascular injury is presented which explains the triphasic dose-response relationship for the latent period. The 95% confidence limits for the dose location of both of the dose-dependent regions were less than 10% of the administered dose. Therefore, if used correctly, the latent period as an end point should be able to be used to detect dose-modifying parameters (i.e. RBE and OER) that are greater than 20%.",Included

Methods and materials Twenty-two patients with chemodectomas of the skull base were treated with FSRT at our institution. Ten patients received primary RT, and 12 patients were treated for recurrent or progressive disease after primary surgery (8 patients) or embolization (4 patients). The median total dose was 57.6 Gy, with a median of 1.8 Gy/fraction. The median target volume was 71.8 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 10.5-212.2 cm <sup>3</sup>). The most common symptoms at the initial diagnosis were pulsatile tinnitus (16 patients), hearing loss (14 patients), and balance disturbance (14 patients). Twelve patients had additional cranial nerve deficits. Results The median follow-up was 5.7 years (range, 19-177 months). The actuarial overall survival rate was 89.5% at 5 and 10 years. The actuarial local control rate was 90.4% at 5 and 10 years. Seven patients (32%) had a partial response and 13 (59%) had stable disease of the irradiated chemodectoma. Two symptomatic patients developed recurrence after 19 and 32 months. Neurologic dysfunction improved or completely resolved in 59% and stabilized in 32%; 9% of patients experienced impairment of preexisting neurologic dysfunction. No patient developed new neurologic deficits after FSRT. RT was interrupted in 1 patient because of a maxillary bone abscess. In all other patients, no acute or late adverse reactions greater than Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 were seen. Conclusion Fractionated stereotactic conformal radiotherapy is an effective and well-tolerated noninvasive treatment for chemodectomas, with excellent tumor control rates and a low risk of morbidity.

501,"Functional imaging of the brain in the evaluation of drug response and its application to the study of aging Functional neuroimaging techniques including single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) can provide insight into the functional connectivity of the human brain in both health and disease, including the effects of aging and drugs on brain function. Neuroimaging measurement techniques can either be direct, using radiospecific ligands, or indirect, using the neurophysiological consequences of pharmacological interventions. Both approaches can be combined with sensorimotor or cognitive activation to examine the interaction between the targeted receptor function and the sensorimotor or cognitive process implicit in the study design. Using radionuclides, PET can provide absolute measurement of cerebral blood flow to regions of interest and can measure changes in cerebral metabolism using labelled fluorodeoxyglucose. PET offered the first opportunity to image brain activation caused by a variety of stimuli and hence to measure the effect of drugs on brain activation. PET also enables the study of drug disposition within the brain. SPECT has been used to study relative changes in cerebral blood flow associated with disease processes and also receptor occupancy. FMRI, by contrast, does not involve ionising radiation and has better spatial and temporal resolution. It is still a relatively new technique and limited by its ability to only measure haemodynamic changes through the blood oxygen lever dependent (BOLD) signal. The effects of aging on drug responsiveness and the effects of drug treatment of diseases associated with old age are relatively unexplored areas of functional neuroimaging research.",Excluded

The distribution of climbing fibres on cerebellar Purkinje cells has been studied with intracellular recordings in X-irradiated and normal rats. 2. In the treated rats, multiple steps in the post-synaptic potential were elicited in 57% of the Purkinje cells by graded stimulation of the climbing fibres, the response was all-or-none in character in the other cells and in all Purkinje cells recorded in normal animals. In the neurones exhibiting the former type of response, no collision was seen along the afferent fibres during interaction experiments between just-threshold juxtafastigial and maximal olivary stimulations, whereas a collision always occurred when all-or-none responses were recorded. 3. These results show that in X-irradiated rats, the majority of Purkinje cells have a multiple innervation by two to four climbing fibres, instead of the one-to-one relationship seen normally. 4. Input resistances and total electrotonic lengths of Purkinje cells were measured in normal and treated rats. Mean values for these two parameters were higher than normal in multiply innervated cells. 5. Mean time course and mean current for reversal of the post-synaptic potential elicited in Purkinje cells by stimulation of the climbing fibres were nearly the same in mono- and in multiply innervated neurones. In multiply innervated cells, time courses and currents for reversal were independent of the size of the response or varied slightly with it, suggesting that the climbing fibres involved innervated territories whose electrotonic distance from the recording site were either the same or slightly different. 6. Interactions between two all-or-none steps of the graded post-synaptic potential evoked in multiply innervated cells by juxtafastigial and olivary stimulations revealed either a very weak or a very marked shunting effect between synapses of the two climbing fibres involved. 7. These results indicate that the over-all distribution of climbing fibre synapses on multiply innervated Purkinje cells is not grossly abnormal and that two fibres contacting a given cell can be either intermingled on the same dendrites, or segregated on distinct dendritic branches. 8. In general, the present study does not suggest the existence of a strong competition among climbing fibres innervating each Purkinje cell during development at least when granule cells are absent.",Included
1659,"Cochlear-implant high pulse rate and narrow electrode configuration impair transmission of temporal information to the auditory cortex In the most commonly used cochlear prosthesis systems, temporal features of sound are signaled by amplitude modulation of constant-rate pulse trains. Several convincing arguments predict that speech reception should be optimized by use of pulse rates > or approximately 2,000 pulses per second (pps) and by use of intracochlear electrode configurations that produce restricted current spread (e.g., bipolar rather than monopolar configurations). Neither of those predictions has been borne out in consistent improvements in speech reception. Neurons in the auditory cortex of anesthetized guinea pigs phase lock to the envelope of sine-modulated electric pulse trains presented through a cochlear implant. The present study used that animal model to quantify the effects of carrier pulse rate, electrode configuration, current level, and modulator wave shape on transmission of temporal information from a cochlear implant to the auditory cortex. Modulation sensitivity was computed using a signal-detection analysis of cortical phase-locking vector strengths. Increasing carrier pulse rate in 1-octave steps from 254 to 4,069 pps resulted in systematic decreases in sensitivity. Comparison of sine- versus square-wave modulator waveforms demonstrated that some, but not all, of the loss of modulation sensitivity at high pulse rates was a result of the decreasing size of pulse-to-pulse current steps at the higher rates. Use of a narrow bipolar electrode configuration, compared with the monopolar configuration, produced a marked decrease in modulation sensitivity. Results from this animal model suggest explanations for the failure of high pulse rates and/or bipolar electrode configurations to produce hoped-for improvements in speech reception.",Excluded
1326,"Management of patients with oligometastatic/ resectable stage IV NSCLC For the past decade, the standard first-line therapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with adequate ECOG performance status (<2) has been platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with a reported median overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months, which has slightly improved to 12 months with the addition of bevacizumab. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, gefitinib and erlotinib, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, crizotinib, have been shown to provide longer progression-free survival (PFS) and fewer side effects as first-line therapy, compared with chemotherapy in patients with certain histological subtypes and activating mutations. However, despite therapeutic developments, palliative treatment is standard for many stage IV NSCLC patients and the prognosis remains poor, with relative 5-year survival rates <=4%, compared with an average of approximately 17% for all patients with NSCLC. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a subgroup of stage IV NSCLC with a limited number/ number of sites of metastatic disease, usually 1-5 metastatic lesions. While only a small subset of patients present with such limited metastases (brain metastasis <50%, adrenal gland metastasis ~7%), they may be suitable for, and achieve long-term survival following, eradication of both the primary and metastatic tumours. For example, reported 5-year survival rates for NSCLC patients with solitary brain or adrenal metastasis who underwent surgical removal of both primary lung and metastatic disease ranged from 7-24% and 25-34%, respectively, which is higher than the average of <=4% for all stage IV NSCLC patients. In addition to having an adequate performance status, there are additional key prognostic factors for identifying oligometastatic NSCLC patients likely to benefit from aggressive therapy; staging of the metastatic lesions, lymph node involvement and status of the primary lung tumour. A lower number of metastatic sites is predictive of good clinical outcome, with >2 metastatic sites associated with shorter PFS. The organ involved in metastatic spread may also impact clinical outcome as, for instance, patients with brain and adrenal gland metastases are more suitable for surgical intervention compared with bone or liver. Given the importance of number and site of metastatic lesions, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are vital for accurate staging of oligometastatic disease. An association between N0 disease and increased long-term survival compared with N1/N2 disease has been observed. For example, following surgical treatment of one cohort of patients with solitary NSCLC adrenal gland metastasis, those with N2 disease had 0% median 5-year survival rate, compared with 52% for N0/N1 patients (P=0.001). Pathologic staging of lymph nodes is therefore critical. The status of the primary lung tumour also impacts clinical outcome, as the primary tumour must itself be resectable. Stage III primary disease is associated with worse survival outcome than stage I or II in patients undergoing surgical excision of brain and adrenal gland metastases, with a reported 5-year survival rate of 0% for stage III, compared with 63% and 77% for stage I and II, respectively. Similarly, patients with oligometastatic disease and a controlled primary site, or 'oligorecurrance', have better prognosis than those with an uncontrolled primary tumour. Histological subtype of NSCLC may also impact prognosis in oligometastatic NSCLC, with adenocarcinoma associated with the most favourable outcomes. Although an optimal disease-free interval (DFI) to define synchronous and metachronous disease has not been agreed upon, synchronous oligometastasis is generally associated with poorer survival outcomes. Patients receiving adrenalectomy for oligometastatic NSCLC with DFI <=6 months had median OS of 12 months versus 31 months for DFI >6 months. Similar results were reported for isolated brain metastasis. Oligometastatic NSCLC is a stage IV cancer and as a guiding principle therapy should be simple and minimally invasive. Furthermore, given the diffuse nature of this disease state, management should ideally involve a multidisciplinary team as the primary and metastatic cancer must be treated, requiring a wide range of expertise. Surgery and radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] in the brain and stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] in extracranial sites) are the two most common methods of tumour ablation. In general, radiosurgery is less invasive than surgery and is therefore useful for patients ineligible for surgery. Additionally, evidence suggests SBRT may be more applicable to limited extracranial metastasis to multiple organs compared with surgery. The treatment of limited brain metastases has been evaluated through several randomised clinical trials. Surgical resection plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of oligometastasis in the brain led to significantly prolonged OS compared with WBRT alone - as high as 40 weeks in one trial, compared with 15 weeks for WBRT (P<0.01). Further, a study of SRS with WBRT in patients with 1-4 brain metastases showed improved survival outcomes for patients with solitary brain metastases and improved clinical outcomes for patients with >1 site of metastatic disease, compared with WBRT alone. Overall, SRS plus WBRT is considered an acceptable choice for those patients with limited brain metastasis who are not suitable for surgery. Adrenalectomy is the standard of care for adrenal gland metastases, with OS ranging from 11-31 months. There have been no randomised trials of the use of SBRT in the adrenal gland setting, although one retrospective study reported OS of 23 months for isolated adrenal metastases treated with SBRT. Further, a recent review article of extracranial oligometastatic disease from various primary cancers suggests that survival following SBRT compares favourably to surgery. One of the key challenges for the management of oligometastatic NSCLC is continuing to improve diagnosis and prognostic factors to more accurately identify those patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who are likely to benefit from ablative treatment, as well as distinguish truly isolated metastatic disease from early-stage metastasis that later develops into widely disseminated disease. Continuing advances in imaging technology will play a role in refining diagnosis and prognosis. From a treatment perspective, challenges include cognitive problems associated with WBRT and the current lack of randomised trial data comparing surgery, radiosurgery and standard of care. To this end, there are several ongoing clinical trials, such as the randomized SABR-COMET study, which compares palliative radiation with stereotactic ablative radiation for <=3 metastatic tumours to any single organ.",Excluded
3300,"To optimize the CT scanner in SPECT/CT equipment of Nuclear medicine Objective: Since the invention of SPECT/CT, more and more nuclear medicine physicians are adding the CT scanner to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. However, in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy, in the meantime, also increase the patients' radiative dose. Summarized empirical Methods from the previous practice work, we hope to draw an optimized scheme of CT scanner, to reduce patients' radiation doses and dicrease the exposure time of the CT Tube. Method(s): To optimize voltage, current, exposure time, front and back of collimator, pitch factor, matrix and a series of acquisition parameters, we analysis the continuous clinical examples in four months, change the different levels of parameter sloely, and retrospect the CT radiative dose. We also compare to the quality of the image and constantly try to optimize the improvement. In the meantime, we statistics the monthly CT Bulb exposure time, exposure time per capita tube data and so on. Result(s): Compared with former optimization, the average CT radiational dose per person is decreased by 84.72%, Which conventional bone group radiation reduced by 83.82% (t = 24.362, P<0.001), the small joints of the bone group radiation reduced by 88.80% (t = 24.914, P<0.001), cerebral group radiation reduced by 86.78% (t = 61.008, P<0.001), the heart group radiation reduced by 84.49% (t = 52.994, P<0.001), the differences are statistically significant.

Evaluated were metabolite indices and metabolite ratios. Logistic linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to evaluate PFS6 and OS, respectively. These analyses were adjusted by age and MR scanner field strength (1.5 T or 3 T). Stepwise regression was performed to determine a subset of the most relevant variables.RESULTS: Associated with shorter PFS6 were a decrease in the ratio of N-acetyl aspartate to choline-containing compounds (NAA/Cho) in the region with a Cho-to-NAA index (CNI) >3 at baseline and an increase of the CNI within elevated CNI regions (>2) at F2mo. Patients with higher normalized lipid and lactate at either time point had significantly worse OS. Patients who had larger volumes with abnormal CNI at F2mo had worse PFS6 and OS.CONCLUSIONS: Our study found more 3D MRSI parameters that predicted PFS6 and OS for patients with GBM than did anatomic, diffusion, or perfusion imaging, which were previously evaluated in the same population of patients.",Excluded
1581,"X-ray fluorescence microscopy reveals accumulation and secretion of discrete intracellular zinc pools in the lactating mouse mammary gland BACKGROUND: The mammary gland is responsible for the transfer of a tremendous amount of zinc ( approximately 1-3 mg zinc/day) from maternal circulation into milk during lactation to support the growth and development of the offspring. When this process is compromised, severe zinc deficiency compromises neuronal development and immune function and increases infant morbidity and/or mortality. It remains unclear as to how the lactating mammary gland dynamically integrates zinc import from maternal circulation with the enormous amount of zinc that is secreted into milk.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Herein we utilized X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) which allowed for the visualization and quantification of the process of zinc transfer through the mammary gland of the lactating mouse. Our data illustrate that a large amount of zinc first accumulates in the mammary gland during lactation. Interestingly, this zinc is not cytosolic, but accumulated in large, discrete sub-cellular compartments. These zinc pools were then redistributed to small intracellular vesicles destined for secretion in a prolactin-responsive manner. Confocal microscopy identified mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus as the sub-cellular compartments which accumulate zinc; however, zinc pools in the Golgi apparatus, but not mitochondria are redistributed to vesicles destined for secretion during lactation.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data directly implicate the Golgi apparatus in providing a large, mobilizable zinc storage pool to assist in providing for the tremendous amount of zinc that is secreted into milk. Interestingly, our study also provides compelling evidence that mitochondrial zinc pools expand in the mammary gland during lactation which we speculate may play a role in regulating mammary gland function.",Excluded
2601,"Should irinotecan or etoposide be used in combination with carboplatin for small cell lung cancer? Little progress has been made in the treatment of small cell lung cancer over the past two decades.

In this Practice Point we discuss a randomized, phase III trial by Hermes and colleagues, which included 220 patients with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer and showed superiority of carboplatin-irinotecan versus carboplatin-oral etoposide. In this trial, 47% of patients had a performance status >=3 and 35% were older than 70 years, which represents a typical clinical practice population of patients; however, oral administration of etoposide and an arbitrary dose reduction in elderly and unfit patients represent limitations of the study. A European trial of irinotecan-carboplatin versus intravenous etoposide-carboplatin has completed accrual and results will be analyzed in 2009. Although the results of the study by Hermes et al. are of interest, substitution of etoposide by irinotecan can not be recommended.",Excluded
105,"Use of non-ablative dose of radiation to enhance delivery of unmodified morpholino oligonucleotides in a brain tumor model to silence mgmt and enhance the efficacy of chemo-radiation Objective: Non-ablative Ionizing radiation ( XRT) is well known to alter neuro-vascular unit (NVU) permeability. We evaluate the use of XRT to enhance delivery of intravenously administered Morpholino Oligonucleotides designed to silence O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in a MGMT expressing human derived brain tumor xenograft model. Background(s): MGMT, a key DNA repair enzyme is associated with resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). We have previously reported the use of a non-ablative dose of ionizing radiation (XRT) to prime human cancer cells to enhance the uptake of unmodified anti-MGMT morpholino oligonucleotides (AMONs) to achieve statistically significant reduction in the in-vitro proliferation index and cell viability with a single dose of AMONs and TMZ. Our prior work has demonstrated that this is by enlarge mediated by up regulation of physiologic endocytosis after XRT. Design/Methods: Intracranial tumor (MGMT expressing human derived H460 non-small cell lung cancer, n=12) bearing athymic nude rats received a single dose of cranial radiation (2Gy) with oral TMZ for 4 consecutive days starting on the day of XRT. In addition, six animals were randomly selected to receive AMON (10.5mg/kg) 24 hrs after XRT, the remaining served as controls. All animals were euthanized and brains harvested 7 days after XRT and tumor volumes measured by immunoblotting. This experiments was repeated in human derived D283 medulloblastoma xenografts (n=12) Results: A 60% (p=0.034) reduction in MGMT expression was noted in brain tumors treated with XRT and iv AMONs. Although not significant, a 40% reduction in tumors volumes were noted in the animals treated with a single dose of AMONs and chemo-radiation. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate the first use of XRT to guide and enhance delivery of AMONS to brain tumors. In this proof of concept study, silencing MGMT enhances the toxicity of XRT and TMZ. This approach warrants further evaluation and may improve outcomes in patients with tumors with un-methylated MGMT.",Excluded
2832,"Fast acquisition cone-beam computed tomography: Initial experience with a 10 s protocol Background Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) facilitates the acquisition of cross-sectional imaging in angiography suites using a rotational C-arm and digital flat panel detectors. The applications are numerous, including evaluation of implanted devices and localization of cerebrovascular lesions. We present and validate the clinical utility of an alternative fast CBCT acquisition protocol in the context of neurovascular device imaging. Methods Contrast-enhanced (CE)-CBCT images were acquired using a new 10 s protocol in a phantom head model, swine model, and in patients. The acquisition parameters of both the 10 s and 20 s protocols were exactly the same, except for fewer projections (250 projections in 10 s vs 500 projections in 20 s), resulting in reduced scan time. Image quality was measured quantitatively in a controlled phantom study and qualitatively by blinded reviewers. The latter was performed to assess the image quality of the 10 s protocol pertinent to the device visibility and its apposition to the parent artery. Results 10 s CBCT images were comparable to 20 s CBCT in both phantom and animal studies. Of the 25 patient images, the reviewers agreed that they were able to discern the flow diverter struts and assess the apposition in all images. The overall rating for all 10 s images was 4.28 on a 5-point scale. No images were rated as less than 3, which was the average diagnostic quality. The ratings were concordant across three blinded reviewers (kappa =0.411). Additionally, contrast and spatial resolution between 10 s and 20 s images were similar in non-human models. Conclusions CBCT images of neurovascular devices can be obtained successfully using a 10 s acquisition protocol. In addition, the 10 s protocol offers faster acquisition, thus allowing its use in awake patients and with an added advantage of lower radiation and contrast dose.

2814,"Efficacy in vivo of a cancer therapy strategy combining HSV1716 mediated oncolysis with gene transfer and targeted radiotherapy Oncolytic herpes viruses have show promise for the treatment of cancer however it is unlikely that the optimal application of these viruses will be as single therapeutic agents. An alternative strategy would be to utilise these viruses to deliver therapeutic transgenes and enhance their tumour cell killing capacity. The herpes simplex virus-1 deletion mutant HSV1716 is a conditionally- replicating oncolytic virus. The safety of HSV1716 has been demonstrated in phase 1 clinical trails with no toxicity attributable to the virus in any patients and provided proof of principle that the virus is capable of directly destroying human tumour cells while leaving normal cells intact (1). To enhance its therapeutic potential, we have engineered HSV1716 to convey the noradrenaline transporter gene (NAT) and thus rendered transfected cells targetable with the radiopharmaceutical [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG. [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG is currently used in the treatment of NAT-expressing neuroblastoma, phaeochromocytoma and carcinoids. In this study we have utilised the recombinant virus HSV1716/NAT as a dual cell lysis / gene delivery vehicle for targeting of the NAT transgene to human tumour xenografts in vivo. We have shown that intra-tumoural or intra-venous injection of HSV1716/NAT induced the capacity for active uptake of intra-peritoneal administered [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in human glioma, melanoma and colorectal tumour xenograft models which do not express NAT. Tumour growth was significantly delayed after administration of HSV1716/NAT and [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG compared to treatment with either agents alone. However, the efficacy of combination treatment was dependent on the scheduling of delivery of the two agents. These findings support a role for combination radio-/gene therapy for cancer utilising HSV1716 expressing the NAT transgene and targeted radionuclide therapy.",Excluded

3312,"Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as a protective effect of nicaraven in ionizing radiation- and ara-C-induced cell death BACKGROUND: Nicaraven is a drug used for patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and has potent antivasospastic and brain-protective effects. While nicaraven scavenges the hydroxyl radical, the mechanism of its protection remains obscure. In addition to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, nicaraven also exhibits inhibitory action on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The mechanism of the pharmacological action of nicaraven has not yet been clarified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid HL-525 cells were exposed to ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide and the effect of nicaraven on the activation of the Egr-1 promoter was measured. Next, the action of the drug on DNA fragmentation and inhibition of thymidine uptake caused by the genotoxic stimulation of ionizing radiation or cytosine B-D-arabinofuranoside (ara-C) were assessed. Finally, direct inhibition of the PARP enzyme by nicaraven was measured.RESULTS: Nicaraven did not inhibit the activation of the Egr-1 promoter caused by H2O2 and the activation caused by ionizing radiation. However, the drug repressed DNA fragmentation and increased thymidine uptake dose-dependently. Nicaraven had a direct inhibitory effect on PARP.DISCUSSION: The effect of nicaraven on the Egr-1 promoter was different from that of another free-radical scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine. Nicaraven demonstrated similar protection of the PARP inhibitors including 3-aminobenzamide. Since nicaraven directly inhibits the PARP enzyme, the drug might be useful in oncology as well as in studying tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased PARP activity.",Excluded

Here we report our experience with stereotactic radiosurgery for the management of brain metastases from UCC. Method(s): Thirteen consecutive patients with brain metastases from UCC were managed with a Leksell gamma-knife at our institution between January 2003 and December 2010. Clinical features and radiosurgical outcomes of patients were analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): Gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS) was chosen as the only treatment in four patients and performed in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in nine patients. GKRS was conducted simultaneously with WBRT within a 1-month interval in six patients and was chosen as the salvage treatment after WBRT in three patients. The mean number of metastatic brain lesions per patient was 5.7 (range, 1-16). The median cumulative tumor volume was 23.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (range, 2.7-40.2 cm<sup>3</sup>), and the median marginal dose covering the tumors was 14 Gy of a 50 % isodose line (range, 8-25 Gy). Nine patients showed relief of main neurologic symptoms after GKRS. The median length of time that the patients spent in an improved neurologic state was 11.1 weeks (range, 2-39.6 weeks).

2988,"Zinc administration modulates radiation-induced oxidative injury in lens of rat BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant role of zinc (Zn) against radiation-induced cataract in the rat lens after total cranial irradiation with a single 5 Gray (Gy) dose of gamma irradiation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the experiment. The control group did not receive Zn or irradiation but received 1-ml saline orally plus sham-irradiation. The irradiation (IR) group received 5 Gy gamma irradiation to the total cranium as a single dose plus 0.1 ml physiological saline intraperitoneally. The IR plus Zn group received irradiation to total cranium plus 10 mg/kg/day Zn intraperitoneally. Biochemical parameters measured in rat lenses were carried out using spectrophotometric techniques.RESULTS: Lens total (enzymatic plus non-enzymatic) superoxide scavenger activity (TSSA), glutathione reductase (GRD), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities significantly increased in the IR plus Zn groups when compared with the IR group. However, TSSA, GRD and GST activities were significantly lower in the IR group when compared with the control group. Lens non-enzymatic superoxide scavenger activity (NSSA) in the IR plus Zn group was significantly increased compared to that of the IR group. Lens xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the IR group significantly increased compared to that of both the control and IR plus Zn groups.CONCLUSION: Zn has clear antioxidant properties and prevented oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals generated by ionizing radiation in rat lenses.",Included
1917,"[Experimental data for administration of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for prevention of radiation myelopathy] BACKGROUND: Current models of radiation myelopathy provide a rationale for growth factor-based prevention strategies. Thus, we tested whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) alone or in combination modulate radiation tolerance of the rat cervical spinal cord.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cervical spinal cord of 68 adult Fisher F344 rats received a total dose of 30-36 Gy, given as a single fraction of 16 Gy followed by a second radiation dose of 14-20 Gy. Continuous intrathecal infusion of bFGF (44 rats) or saline (24 rats) into the cisterna magna was given concomitantly. A further experiment included 14 additional rats which were treated with subcutaneous injection of IGF-1 parallel to irradiation with a total dose of 34 Gy or 36 Gy. 20 rats received combined treatment, i.e. intrathecal infusion of bFGF plus subcutaneous injection of IGF-1, starting 24 hours before irradiation (total dose 33 Gy or 36 Gy) for a total of 4 days. Animals were followed until myelopathy developed or for a maximum of 12 months. Histopathologic examinations were performed post mortem.RESULTS: Treatment with bFGF alone or IGF-1 alone increased the median time to myelopathy significantly. In the 36-Gy group, after combination treatment a comparable prolongation of latency was seen. Moreover, rats treated with 33 Gy and combined bFGF plus IGF-1 showed a significantly reduced risk of myelopathy, too (p = 0.0015, Figures 1 and 2).CONCLUSION: Combination of IGF-1 and bFGF was more potent than single agent treatment. We observed a significantly reduced myelopathy rate at an intermediate radiation dose level and a longer time to myelopathy at a high-dose level. This finding strengthens the evidence that brief therapeutic intervention can decrease radiation-induced neurotoxicity. Further studies will be undertaken to optimize this strategy.",Excluded

Saline (control) or DFMO (150 mg/kg/day) was infused for 18 days starting 2 days before irradiation. At varying times up to 8 weeks after irradiation, brain tissues were collected and the cell responses in and around the focal lesion were quantified. Immunohistochemical stains were used to label astrocytes (GFAP), vascular endothelial cells (Factor VIII), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs; MAC 387) and cells synthesizing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (BrdU). Cellular responses were quantified using a histomorphometric analysis.RESULTS: After radiation alone, cellular events included a substantial acute inflammatory response followed by increased BrdU labeling and progressive increases in numbers of capillaries and astrocytes. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine treatment significantly affected the measured cell responses. As in controls, an early inflammatory response was measured, but after 2 weeks there were more PMNs/unit area than in controls. The onset of measurable BrdU labeling was delayed in DFMO-treated animals, and the magnitude of labeling was significantly reduced. Increases in astrocyte and vessel numbers/mm2 were observed after a 2-week delay. At the site of implant, astrocytes from DFMO-treated dogs were significantly smaller than those from controls.CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial cell proliferation and infiltration in response to interstitial irradiation of normal brain, and these responses are significantly altered by DFMO treatment. Although the precise mechanisms by which DFMO exerts its effects in this model are not known, the results from this study suggest that modification of radiation injury may be possible by manipulating the response of normal cells to injury.",Included
2575,"Morphological manifestations of functional changes in the hypothalamic pituitary neurosecretory system and kidneys of rats after space flight Morphologic examination of the hypothalamic pituitary neurosecretory system and kidneys of rats flown for 22 d and sacrificed 2 and 27 d postflight was carried out. By histologic and histochemical methods, indications of increased activities of the hypothalamicpituitary neurosecretory system and the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys were found. The changes were reversible and by the 27th postflight day returned to the normal. It is suggested that the changes in the above systems may be produced not only by flight effects but also by readaptation of animals to 1 g.",Included

483,"Low (20 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle radiation lead to a persistent reduction in the spatial learning ability of rats Exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is considered to be a potential health risk in long-term space travel, and it represents a significant risk to the central nervous system (CNS). The most harmful component of GCR is the HZE [high-mass, highly charged (Z), high-energy] particles, e.g. <sup>56</sup>Fe. In previous ground-based experiments, exposure to high doses of HZE-particle radiation induced pronounced deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rodents. Recent data suggest that glutamatergic transmission in hippocampal synaptosomes is impaired after low (60 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles, which could lead to impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. To assess the effects of mission-relevant (2060 cGy) doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles on hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, male Wistar rats either received sham treatment or were irradiated and tested 3 months later in the Barnes maze test. Compared to the controls, rats that received 20, 40 and 60 cGy 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles showed significant impairments in their ability to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze, which was manifested by progressively increasing escape latency times over the 3 days of testing. However, this increase was not due to a lack of motivation of the rats to escape, because the total number of head pokes (and especially incorrect head pokes) remained constant over the test period. Given that rats exposed to X rays did not exhibit spatial memory impairments until >10 Gy was delivered, the RBE for 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe-particle-induced hippocampal spatial memory impairment is ~50. These data demonstrate that mission-relevant doses of 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles can result in severe deficits in hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive tasks, and the extreme sensitivity of these processes to 1 GeV/u <sup>56</sup>Fe particles must arise due to the perturbation of multiple processes in addition to killing neuronal cells. © 2012 by Radiation Research Society.

759,"Safety and Accuracy of the Freehand Placement of C7 Pedicle Screws in Cervical and Cervicothoracic Constructs BACKGROUND: Cervical pedicle screws are advantageous in their biomechanical stability within cervical and cervicothoracic constructs. The seventh cervical vertebra contains relatively large pedicles and has a low incidence of vertebral artery localization within the transverse foramina. The freehand technique of pedicle screw insertion is advantageous in decreasing intraoperative radiation exposure both to the patient and surgeon. In this study, we investigated the safety and accuracy of C7 pedicle screw placement at our institution utilizing an anatomic freehand technique.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was performed, and 20 patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria over a five-year period (2013-2018). The C7 pedicle screw placement capability and accuracy were recorded. Accuracy was graded based upon postoperative imaging on a Grade 0-3 scale for breach assessment. Any neurologic complications related to screw placement were also recorded.RESULTS: Successful pedicle screw placement occurred in 90% of attempts (36/40). The overall screw accuracy rate was 89% (32/36). There were four minor breaches (Grade 1) identified on CT, without neurologic complications. The fusion rate in our cohort for patients with follow up greater than eight months was 100%.CONCLUSIONS: In our patient series, the freehand technique of C7 pedicle screw placement utilizing a small laminotomy with direct pedicle palpation appears to be a safe and accurate method for screw placement, and provides adequate biomechanical stability for cervical and cervicothoracic construct fusion.",Excluded
540,"Calcium-induced calcium release in rod photoreceptor terminals boosts synaptic transmission during maintained depolarization We examined the contribution of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) to synaptic transmission from rod photoreceptor terminals. Whole-cell recording and confocal calcium imaging experiments were conducted on rods with intact synaptic terminals in a retinal slice preparation from salamander. Low concentrations of ryanodine stimulated calcium increases in rod terminals, consistent with the presence of ryanodine receptors. Application of strong depolarizing steps (-70 to -10 mV) exceeding 200 ms or longer in duration evoked a wave of calcium that spread across the synaptic terminals of voltage-clamped rods. This secondary calcium increase was blocked by high concentrations of ryanodine, indicating it was due to CICR. Ryanodine (50 microm) had no significant effect on rod calcium current (I(ca)) although it slightly diminished rod light-evoked voltage responses. Bath application of 50 microm ryanodine strongly inhibited light-evoked currents in horizontal cells. Whether applied extracellularly or delivered into the rod cell through the patch pipette, ryanodine (50 microm) also inhibited excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked in horizontal cells by depolarizing steps applied to rods. Ryanodine caused a preferential reduction in the later portions of EPSCs evoked by depolarizing steps of 200 ms or longer. These results indicate that CICR enhances calcium increases in rod terminals evoked by sustained depolarization, which in turn acts to boost synaptic exocytosis from rods.",Excluded
