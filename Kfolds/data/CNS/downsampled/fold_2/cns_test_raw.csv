3501,"Standard radiotherapy for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma results in progressive tract-specific brain white matter alterations: A one-year follow-up via diffusion tensor imaging BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation therapy (RT)-induced neurocognitive disability may be mediated by brain tissue damage. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of standard RT on normal brain tissue via in vivo neuroimaging in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 146 newly diagnosed NPC patients who were treated with standard RT were longitudinally followed up at multiple time points during the first year post-RT, with 19 comparable healthy controls followed up in parallel serving as normal age-related benchmarks. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used to evaluate longitudinal brain white matter tract changes in NPC patients. The relationships between RT-related white matter changes, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive impairment were also assessed.RESULTS: Bilateral cingulate angular bundle (CAB) fibers had progressive diffusion reduction [radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity] over time (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) in NPC patients during the first year after RT. RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with longitudinal atrophy of the ipsilateral hippocampus (P = 0.033). Additionally, RT-associated progressive RD reduction in the left CAB correlated with progressive cognitive impairment in NPC patients post-RT (P = 0.048).CONCLUSION: We present evidence of progressive RT-associated changes in the bilateral CAB in NPC patients, which may underlie RT-related cognitive impairment. These findings illustrate that the use of white matter tract alterations as potential biomarkers to detect RT-related brain injury in NPC patients may be useful for better understanding the pathogenesis of RT-induced cognitive decline.",Included
3048,"Functional results after ileocystoplasty The functional results after ileocystoplasty were studied in seven patients with interstitial cystitis, irradiated bladder and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. None of the patients had had symptomatic improvement by medical or surgical means. All patients were suffering from urinary frequency and five patients had severe urge incontinence or suprapubic pains. Postoperatively the patients were followed from 8 to 66 months and evaluated by urodynamic examinations and interviews. Urinary frequency was improved in all patients but one with interstitial cystitis who had persisting suprapubic pains. None had residual urine volume greater than 30 ml postoperatively. It is concluded that bladder augmentation by ileocystoplasty is an excellent method of treatment for patients with contracted bladder secondary to interstitial cystitis, irradiated bladder, and detrusor hyperreflexia and sphincter dyssynergia.",Excluded
3338,"[Orthostatic hypotension after space flight] Cardiovascular changes occur during spaceflight. Because of the loss of hydrostatic pressure there is, during weightlessness, a fluid shift of extra- and intra-vascular volumes to the upper part of the body. This provokes objective and subjective symptoms, especially in the first days of spaceflight. The fluid shift is perceived by baroreceptors as a relative central hypervolaemia and induces neuro-hormonal mechanisms which provoke a real hypovolaemia. Cardiovascular deconditioning exists during spaceflight with the following symptoms when astronauts return to earth: decreased orthostatic tolerance with possible tendency towards spontaneous syncope and decreased effort capacity. The mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance are not well known. Several factors are probably involved, including hypovolaemia, modifications of the venous system, baroreflex changes, etc. Various countermeasures have been tested in microgravity simulations on the ground, then in flight.

3260,"Robotic stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus tumors The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate our therapeutic results in patients with paranasal sinus (PNS) or nasal cavity (NC) malignancies treated with robotic stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Between August 2007 and October 2008, 27 patients with PNS or NC tumors were treated in our department using SRS. Median age was 53 years (range, 27-84 years). Eleven patients were female and sixteen were male. Most common histopathology was SCC (44%). The disease involved the maxillary sinus in 15 patients (55%). SRS was applied to 6 patients (22%) for reirradiation, while the others received it as a primary treatment. Seven patients had SRS as a boost dose to external beam radiotherapy. SRS was delivered with cyberknife (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The median dose to the tumor was 31 Gy (range, 15-37.5 Gy) in median 5 fractions (range, 3-5 fractions). After a median follow-up of 21.4 months (range, 3-59 months), 76% of the patients were free of local relapse. Three patients showed local progression and 3 developed distant metastases. One- and two-year survival rates for the entire group were 95.2% (SEM = 0.046) and 77.1% (SEM = 0.102), respectively. We observed brain necrosis in 2 patients, visual disorder in 2 patients, bone necrosis in 2 patients and trismus in 1 patient as a SRS related late toxicity. Robotic SRS seems to be a feasible treatment strategy for patients with PNS tumors. Further prospective studies with longer follow up times should be performed.",Excluded
2867,"Early neural grafts transiently reduce the behavioral effects of radiation-induced fascia dentata granule cell hypoplasia X-irradiation of the neonatal rat hippocampus produces a selective hypoplasia of fascia dentata granule cells, locomotor hyperactivity, perseverative movements and deficits in passive avoidance. We previously reported that transplantation of fetal hippocampal tissue into the adult (age = 182 +/- 4 days) brain produced a partial recovery of these behavioral deficits. Since graft/host interconnections are more prominent when transplants are conducted soon after radiation-induced hippocampal damage, in this study we transplanted hippocampal or cerebral cortex neurons when host rats were 33 +/- 5 days of age (i.e. only 16 days after radiogenic brain damage). Behavioral evaluations were conducted 80 and 182 days after transplantation or surgical control procedures. In the first test series only, selective components of locomotion (e.g. stereotypy and total distance traveled) and perseverative turning (e.g. mean bout length and turning speed topography) were normalized by the hippocampal grafts. Radiation-induced changes in passive avoidance were less prominent in these studies than in past experiments. Still, transplantation of hippocampal tissue improved performance on this learning task as well. Cerebral cortex grafts did not produce reliable improvements in most behavioral measures. These data suggest that hippocampal grafts placed soon after X-ray induced fascia dentata hypoplasia reduce a broad range of behavioral deficits. However, these benefits are transient and, for the most part, depend on the use of transplant tissues homologous with those damaged.",Excluded
2931,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutant glioblastomas demonstrate a decreased rate of pseudoprogression: A multi-institutional experience Background: Pseudoprogression (psPD) represents false radiologic evidence of tumor progression and is observed in some glioblastoma (GBM) patients after postoperative chemoradiation (CRT) with temozolomide (TMZ). The ambiguity of the psPD diagnosis confounds identification of true progression and may lead to unnecessary interventions. The association between psPD and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutational (mut) status is understudied, and its incidence may alter clinical decision making. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated 120 patients with IDH1-mut (n = 60) and IDH1-wild-type (IDH-WT; [n = 60]) GBMs who received postoperative CRT with TMZ at 4 academic institutions. Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria were used to identify psPD rates in routine brain MRIs performed up to 90 days after CRT completion. Result(s): Within 90 days of completing CRT, 9 GBM patients (1 [1.7%] IDH1-mut and 8 [13.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated true progression, whereas 17 patients (3 [5%] IDH1-muts and 14 [23.3%] IDH1-WTs) demonstrated psPD (P =. 004). IDH1-mut GBMs had a lower probability of psPD (hazard ratio: 0.173, 95% CI, 0.047-0.638, P =. 008). Among the patients with radiologic signs suggestive of progression (n = 26), psPD was found to be the cause in 3 of 4 (75.0%) of the IDH1-mut GBMs and 14 of 22 (63.6%) of the IDH1-WT GBMs (P =. 496). Median overall survival for IDH1-mut and IDH1-WT GBM patients was 40.3 and 23.0 months, respectively (P <. 001). Conclusion(s): IDH1-mut GBM patients demonstrate lower absolute rates of psPD expression. Irrespective of GBM subtype, psPD expression was more likely than true progression within 90 days of completing CRT. Continuing adjuvant treatment for IDH1-mut GBMs is suggested if radiologic progression is suspected during this time interval. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

3383,"Urethral pain among prostate cancer survivors 1 to 14 years after radiation therapy PURPOSE: To investigate how treatment-related and non-treatment-related factors impact urethral pain among long-term prostate cancer survivors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Men treated for prostate cancer with radiation therapy at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden from 1993 to 2006 were approached with a study-specific postal questionnaire addressing symptoms after treatment, including urethral burning pain during urination (n=985). The men had received primary or salvage external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT in combination with brachytherapy (BT). Prescribed doses were commonly 70 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions for primary and salvage EBRT and 50 Gy plus 2x10.0 Gy for EBRT+BT. Prostatic urethral doses were assessed from treatment records. We also recruited 350 non-pelvic-irradiated, population-based controls matched for age and residency to provide symptom background rates.RESULTS: Of the treated men, 16% (137 of 863) reported urethral pain, compared with 11% (27 of 242) of the controls. The median time to follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1.1-14.3 years). Prostatic urethral doses were similar to prescription doses for EBRT and 100% to 115% for BT. Fractionation-corrected dose and time to follow-up affected the occurrence of the symptom. For a follow-up>=3 years, 19% of men (52 of 268) within the 70-Gy EBRT+BT group reported pain, compared with 10% of men (23 of 222) treated with 70 Gy primary EBRT (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0). Of the men treated with salvage EBRT, 10% (20 of 197) reported urethral pain.CONCLUSIONS: Survivors treated with EBRT+BT had a higher risk for urethral pain compared with those treated with EBRT. The symptom prevalence decreased with longer time to follow-up. We found a relationship between fractionation-corrected urethral dose and pain. Among long-term prostate cancer survivors, the occurrence of pain was not increased above the background rate for prostatic urethral doses up to 70 Gy3.",Included
2974,"InterCardioRisk: a novel online tool for estimating doses of ionising radiation to occupationally-exposed medical staff and their associated health risks Those working in interventional cardiology and related medical procedures are potentially subject to considerable exposure to x-rays. Two types of tissue of particular concern that may receive considerable doses during such procedures are the lens of the eye and the brain. Ocular radiation exposure results in lens changes that, with time, may progress to partial or total lens opacification (cataracts). In the early stages, such opacities do not result in visual disability; the severity of such changes tends to increase progressively with dose and time until vision is impaired and cataract surgery is required. Scattered radiation doses to the eye lens of an interventional cardiologist in typical working conditions can exceed 34 muGy min<sup>-1</sup> in high-dose fluoroscopy modes and 3 muGy per image during image acquisition (instantaneous rate values) when radiation protection tools are not used. A causal relation between exposure to ionising radiation and increased risk of brain and central nervous system tumours has been shown in a number of studies. Although absorbed doses to the brain in interventional cardiology procedures are lower than those to the eye lens by a factor between 3.40 and 8.08 according to our simulations, doses to both tissues are among the highest occupational radiation doses documented for medical staff whose work involves exposures to x-rays. We present InterCardioRisk, a tool featuring an easy-to-use web interface that provides a general estimation of both cumulated absorbed doses experienced by medical staff exposed in the interventional cardiology setting and their estimated associated health risks.

3365,"Radiosurgery in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas: Experience at the Carlos Haya Hospital Introduction. The treatment of malignant glioma consists in complete surgery or broadest possible, followed by radiation on the previous location of the removed tumor and, in many cases, with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy. These tumors have a high recurrence rate despite receiving appropriate treatment, being proportional to histologic grade. Once you see a recurrence, reoperation and change line chemotherapy are usual. Due to the advancement of radiosurgery techniques and greater availability, is being increasingly used for the treatment of small size recurrence, or to treat some rest after surgery. Objective. Descriptive study of patients suffering from malignant gliomas treated with radiosurgery in the Carlos Haya Hospital. Material and methods. Since the implementation of the technique of radiosurgery in the Carlos Haya Hospital in Malaga in 2010, 9 patients were treated with brain gliomas with Brainlab radiosurgery system. The prescribed dose ranged from 16 to 22 Gy, depending on the size of the treated lesion in each case and the dose of radiation that had previously received. Results. Of the 9 patients, 5 were men and 4 women. The most common first symptom was seizures in 5 patients. The distribution of patients according to histology was as follows: 5 glioblastoma multiforme, 2 oligodendrogliomas, 1 ependymoma and 1 astrocytoma grade II. Conclusions. Tolerance of radiosurgery in these patients has been good and the treatment in the absence of increased monitoring, appears to increase local control of the disease.",Excluded
3002,"Experimental and preclinical tools to explore the main neurological impacts of brain irradiation: Current insights and perspectives Radiation therapy is a powerful tool in the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the brain. However, brain tissue tolerance is limited, and radiation doses must be tailored to minimize deleterious effects on the nervous system. Due to improved treatments, including radiotherapy techniques, many patients with brain tumors survive longer, but they experience late effects of radiotherapy, especially cognitive decline, for which no efficient treatment is currently available. Improving the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced neurological defects first needs to better characterize radiation injuries in brain cells and tissues. Rodent models have been widely used for this. Here, observations from patients will be reviewed briefly as an introduction, mainly regarding clinical cognitive defects and anatomical alterations using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This limited descriptive clinical knowledge addresses many questions that arise in preclinical models regarding understanding the mechanism of radiation-induced brain dysfunction. From this perspective, we next present methods to characterize radiation-induced neurogenesis alterations in adult mice and then detail how MRI could be used as a powerful tool to explore these alterations.

2902,"Relationship between DNA double-strand break rejoining and cell survival after exposure to ionizing radiation in human fibroblast strains with differing ATM/p53 status: implications for evaluation of clinical radiosensitivity PURPOSE: To better understand the impact of defects in the DNA damage-surveillance network on the various cell-based assays used for the prediction of patient radiosensitivity.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We examined noncancerous human fibroblast strains from individuals with ataxia telangiectasia (ataxia telangiectasia mutated [ATM] deficient) or Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53 deficient) using the neutral comet, H2AX phosphorylation, and clonogenic survival assays.RESULTS: Using the comet assay, we found that, compared with normal fibroblasts, cells lacking either ATM or p53 function exhibited a reduced rate of double-strand break (DSB) rejoining early (< or =4 h) after exposure to 8 Gy of gamma-radiation and also exhibited high levels of unrejoined DSBs later after irradiation. ATM-deficient and p53-deficient fibroblasts also exhibited abnormally increased levels of phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX) at later intervals after irradiation. In the clonogenic assay, ATM-deficient cells exhibited marked radiosensitivity and p53-deficient cells had varying degrees of radioresistance compared with normal fibroblasts.CONCLUSION: Regardless of whether ataxia telangiectasia and Li-Fraumeni syndrome fibroblasts are DSB-repair deficient per se, it is apparent that p53 and ATM defects greatly influence the cellular phenotype as evidenced by the neutral comet and gamma-H2AX assays. Our data suggest that the gamma-H2AX levels observed at later intervals after irradiation may represent a reliable measure of the overall DSB rejoining capabilities of human fibroblasts. However, it appears that using this parameter as a predictor of radiosensitivity without knowledge of the cells' p53 status could lead to incorrect conclusions.",Excluded
3376,"Mobile Lower Body Negative Pressure Suit as an Integrative Countermeasure for Spaceflight BACKGROUND: Persistent headward fluid shift and mechanical unloading cause neuro-ocular, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal deconditioning during long-term spaceflight. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) reintroduces footward fluid shift and mechanical loading. METHOD(S): We designed, built, and tested a wearable, mobile, and flexible LBNP device (GravitySuit) consisting of pressurized trousers with built-in shoes to support ground reaction forces (GRF) and a thoracic vest to distribute load to the entire axial length of the body. In eight healthy subjects we recorded GRF under the feet and over the shoulders (Tekscan) while assessing cardiovascular response (Nexfin) and footward fluid shift from internal jugular venous cross-sectional area (IJVa) using ultrasound (Terason). RESULT(S): Relative to normal bodyweight (BW) when standing upright, increments of 10 mmHg LBNP from 0 to 40 mmHg while supine induced axial loading corresponding to 0%, 13 +/- 3%, 41 +/- 5%, 75 +/- 11%, and 125 +/- 22% BW, respectively. Furthermore, LBNP reduced IJVa from 1.12 +/- 0.3 cm2 to 0.67 +/- 0.2, 0.50 +/- 0.1, 0.35 +/- 0.1, and 0.31 +/- 0.1 cm2, respectively. LBNP of 30 and 40 mmHg reduced cardiac stroke volume and increased heart rate while cardiac output and mean arterial pressure were unaffected. During 2 h of supine rest at 20 mmHg LBNP, temperature and humidity inside the suit were unchanged (23 +/- 1degreeC; 47 +/- 3%, respectively).DISCUSSION: The flexible GravitySuit at 20 mmHg LBNP comfortably induced mechanical loading and desired fluid displacement while maintaining the mobility of hips and knee joints. The GravitySuit may provide a feasible method to apply low-level, long-term LBNP without interfering with daily activity during spaceflight to provide an integrative countermeasure.Petersen LG, Hargens A, Bird EM, Ashari N, Saalfeld J, Petersen JCG.

2452,"Functional and structural recovery of injured spinal cord following delayed X-irradiation in rats OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that delayed X-irradiation can enhance the functional and structural recovery of the injured spinal cord in rats.METHODS: Seventy Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups, 35 rats in each. The control group sustained a one-minute clip compression (force of clip was 30 g) injury of the spinal cord at the T2 level, without X-irradiation. The experimental group received X-irradiation 14 days after injury. Neurological function was assessed by the modified Tarlov method, including hind limbs movement, inclined plane, and pain withdrawal. These tests were performed in a blinded fashion at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days after injury. At 43 days after injury, histological examination of the injured spinal cord was performed following decapitation of the rats.RESULTS: Sixty-two rats met the experimental requirements (spinal cord injury was similar), 32 rats in experimental group and 30 rats in control group. Statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in hind limbs movement and inclined plane (P < 0.01), but not in the pain withdrawal test. The edema and necrosis areas of injured spinal cords in experimental group were less than those in control group, and axons in experimental group were significantly more than those in control group (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Delayed X-irradiation following spinal cord injury may enhance functional recovery by improving and restoring structural integrity of the injured spinal cord in rats.",Excluded

2659,"Targeting PARP-1 with alpha-particles is potently cytotoxic to human neuroblastoma in preclinical models Alpha-emitters can be pharmacologically delivered for irradiation of single cancer cells, but cellular lethality could be further enhanced by targeting alpha-emitters directly to the nucleus. PARP-1 is a druggable protein in the nucleus that is overexpressed in neuroblastoma compared with normal tissues and is associated with decreased survival in high-risk patients. To exploit this, we have functionalized a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) with an alpha-emitter astatine-211. This approach offers enhanced cytotoxicity from conventional PARPis by not requiring enzymatic inhibition of PARP-1 to elicit DNA damage; instead, the alpha-particle directly induces multiple double-strand DNA breaks across the particle track. Here, we explored the efficacy of [<sup>211</sup>At]MM4 in multiple cancers and found neuroblastoma to be highly sensitive in vitro and in vivo.

2984,"Using synthetic CT for partial brain radiation therapy: Impact on image guidance PURPOSE: Recent advancements in synthetic computed tomography (synCT) from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data have made MRI-only treatment planning feasible in the brain, although synCT performance for image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is not well understood. This work compares geometric equivalence of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CTs and synCTs for brain cancer patients and quantifies performance for partial brain IGRT.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten brain cancer patients (12 lesions, 7 postsurgical) underwent MR-SIM and CT-SIM. SynCTs were generated by combining ultra-short echo time, T1, T2, and fluid attenuation inversion recovery datasets using voxel-based weighted summation. SynCT and CT DRRs were compared using patient-specific thresholding and assessed via overlap index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Jaccard index. Planar IGRT images for 22 fractions were evaluated to quantify differences between CT-generated DRRs and synCT-generated DRRs in 6 quadrants. Previously validated software was implemented to perform 2-dimensional (2D)-2D rigid registrations using normalized mutual information. Absolute (planar image/DRR registration) and relative (differences between synCT and CT DRR registrations) shifts were calculated for each axis and 3-dimensional vector difference. A total of 1490 rigid registrations were assessed.RESULTS: DRR agreements in anteroposterior and lateral views for overlap index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Jaccard index were >0.95. Normalized mutual information results were equivalent in 75% of quadrants. Rotational registration results were negligible (<0.07degree). Statistically significant differences between CT and synCT registrations were observed in 9/18 matched quadrants/axes (P < .05). The population average absolute shifts were 0.77 +/- 0.58 and 0.76 +/- 0.59 mm for CT and synCT, respectively, for all axes/quadrants. Three-dimensional vectors were <2 mm in 77.7 +/- 10.8% and 76.5 +/- 7.2% of CT and synCT registrations, respectively. SynCT DRRs were sensitive in postsurgical cases (vector displacements >2 mm in affected quadrants).CONCLUSIONS: DRR synCT geometry was robust. Although statistically significant differences were observed between CT and synCT registrations, results were not clinically significant.

2852,"Feasibility and clinical tolerability of the extendTM relocatable head frame for perfexionTM intra-cranial stereotactic radiotherapy Purpose: This study aims to identify the challenges in clinical use of the EXTENDTM relocatable head frame (RHF) and to qualitatively report the patient's experience. Materials/Methods: Patients and volunteers enrolled on two prospective clinical trials were fitted, positioned, and immobilized using the RHF. The RHF includes a patient-specific detachable front mouthpiece for dental and hard palate impression. A vacuum is applied to ensure tensionless fixation without the need for active patient cooperation. For positioning, a 1mm action threshold was used. To capture the tolerability of the RHF, subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire immediately after initial fitting, CT simulation, and at the end of their treatment. The questions addressed overall impression and discomfort during the various stages of the procedure. Result(s): Six volunteers completed study procedures without difficulty. Of 21 patients enrolled, one patient was aborted due to geometric constraints of the RHF colliding with his skull, and one patient withdrew from study participation. For the four patients treated on Perfexion the mean difference between CT and PFX position was less than 1mm.Patient anatomy including a high palate, short neck, and broad shoulders were identified as challenges to clinical use of the RHF. Gagging during fitting occurred in six patients and with one patient during positioning. Qualitative review of questionnaires revealed 5 themes: (1) patients have an overall positive impression of the process; (2) most find the dental imprint procedure distressing; (3) positioning was fairly tolerated; (4) overall discomfort during the time of immobilization is none to mild in the hard palate; (5) discomfort to the neck, shoulders and back is mild. Conclusion(s): The study result highlights challenges related to the dental impression procedure, and the importance of a careful patient selection. From the patients perspective the procedure is fairly well tolerated, and may improve by addressing discomforts during the fitting procedure.

3091,"Acid-induced unfolding of brain-derived neurotrophic factor results in the formation of a monomeric ""a state"" Recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor in acid undergoes a slow loss of tertiary structure as monitored by both near-UV circular dichroism and fluorescence, and appears to retain some secondary structure, as monitored by far-UV circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This loss of tertiary structure parallels a decrease in the weight average molecular weight, from dimer to monomer, when examined using light scattering. Increasing the temperature accelerates this slow reaction. This process may be described most simply as N2 in equilibrium with 2D where N and D are the native and denatured forms of the protein, respectively. However, the acid denaturation strongly depends on the protein concentration, with higher concentration resulting in a lower rate and extent of denaturation. This suggests that the more complicated mechanism N2 in equilibrium with 2N in equilibrium with 2D more accurately describes the denaturation, where the dissociation into a native monomer is the rate-limiting step, and the conversion of N to D occurs relatively rapidly. Size-exclusion chromatography (at neutral pH) at several points during denaturation further demonstrated that the amount of tertiary structure remaining paralleled the dimer concentration and also that the monomer form was long-lived, remaining as monomer during the course of the chromatography. Size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity determination indicated that the acid-denatured form is a compact molecule. On the basis of the above data, the acid-denatured form may be considered to be a monomeric compact intermediate A state with no tertiary structure but considerable secondary structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
2590,"Role of the Toll Like receptor (TLR) radical cycle in chronic inflammation: possible treatments targeting the TLR4 pathway Activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex, a receptor of the innate immune system, may underpin the pathophysiology of many human diseases, including asthma, cardiovascular disorder, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune disorders, neuroinflammatory disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, clinical depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, alcohol abuse, and toluene inhalation. TLRs are pattern recognition receptors that recognize damage-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria. Here we focus on the environmental factors, which are known to trigger TLR4, e.g., ozone, atmosphere particulate matter, long-lived reactive oxygen intermediate, pentachlorophenol, ionizing radiation, and toluene. Activation of the TLR4 pathways may cause chronic inflammation and increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and oxidative and nitrosative stress and therefore TLR-related diseases. This implies that drugs or substances that modify these pathways may prevent or improve the abovementioned diseases. Here we review some of the most promising drugs and agents that have the potential to attenuate TLR-mediated inflammation, e.g., anti-LPS strategies that aim to neutralize LPS (synthetic anti-LPS peptides and recombinant factor C) and TLR4/MyD88 antagonists, including eritoran, CyP, EM-163, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, 6-shogaol, cinnamon extract, N-acetylcysteine, melatonin, and molecular hydrogen.

3604,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [11C]raclopride in healthy volunteers PURPOSE: This study reports on the whole-body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [11C]raclopride, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist.METHODS: In three healthy male volunteers, whole-body scans were performed up to 2 h following i.v. injection of 320+/-65 MBq [11C]raclopride. Transmission scans (3 min per step, eight or nine steps according to the height of the subject) in 2D mode were used for subsequent attenuation correction of emission scans. Emission scans (1 min per step, eight or nine steps) were acquired over 2 h. Venous blood samples and urine were collected up to 2 h after injection of the radiotracer. For each subject, the percentage of injected activity measured in regions of interest over brain, intestine, lungs, kidneys and liver was fitted to a mono-exponential model, as an uptake phase followed by a mono-exponential washout, for urinary bladder to generate time-activity curves. Using the MIRD method, several source organs were considered in estimating residence time and mean effective radiation absorbed doses.RESULTS: Blood pressure and ECG findings remained unchanged after tracer injection. The analysed blood and urine pharmacological parameters did not change significantly after [(11)C]raclopride injection. The primary routes of clearance were renal and intestinal. Ten minutes after injection, high activities were observed in the gall-bladder, kidneys and liver. High activity was observed in the gall-bladder during the whole study. The kidneys, urinary bladder wall, liver and gall-bladder received the highest absorbed doses. The average effective dose of [11C]raclopride was estimated to be 6.7+/-0.4 microSv/MBq.CONCLUSION: The amount of [11C]raclopride required for adequate dopamine D2 receptor imaging results in an acceptable effective dose equivalent, permitting two or three repeated clinical PET imaging studies, with the injection of 222 MBq for each study.",Excluded

3393,"Frameless stereotaxy in subthalamic deep brain stimulation: 3-year clinical outcome Background: In most centers, the surgery of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is performed using a stereotactic frame. Compared with frame-based technique, frameless stereotaxy reduces the duration of surgical procedure and patient's discomfort, with lead placing accuracy equivalent after the learning curve. Although several studies have investigated the targeting accuracy of this technique, only a few studies reported clinical outcomes, with data of short-term follow-up. Objective(s): To assess clinical efficacy and safety of frameless bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients at 1- and 3-year follow-up. Method(s): Consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS with a manual adjustable frameless system were included in the study. The data were collected retrospectively. Result(s): Eighteen PD patients underwent bilateral STN-DBS implant and were included in the study. All patients completed 1-year observation and ten of them completed 3-year observation. At 1-year follow-up, motor efficacy of STN stimulation in off-med condition was of 30.1% (P = 0.003) and at 3-year follow-up was of 36.3%, compared with off-stim condition at 3-year follow-up (P = 0.005). Dopaminergic drugs were significantly reduced by 31.2% 1 year after the intervention (P = 0.003) and 31.7% 3 years after the intervention (P = 0.04). No serious adverse events occurred during surgery. Conclusion(s): Frameless stereotaxy is an effective and safe technique for DBS surgery at 1- and 3-year follow-up, with great advantages for patients' discomfort during surgery.

2997,"omega-Conotoxin inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission evoked by dorsal root stimulation in rat superficial dorsal horn A number of omega-conotoxins are potent and selective antagonists of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and are potentially effective as analgesic agents. omega-Conotoxins CVID and CVIB, venom peptides from Conus catus, inhibit N-type and N/P/Q-type VGCCs, respectively, in rat dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons. In the present study, we tested the effects of five different omega-conotoxins, CVID, CVIB, MVIIA, MVIIC and GVIA, on excitatory synaptic transmission between primary afferents and dorsal horn superficial lamina neurons of rat spinal cord. The N-type VGCC antagonists CVID (200nM) and MVIIA (500nM) completely and irreversibly inhibited excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the dorsal horn superficial lamina. The N- and P/Q-type VGCC antagonist CVIB (200nM) reversibly reduced evoked EPSC amplitude an average of 34+/-8%, whereas MVIIC (200nM) had no effect on excitatory synaptic transmission. In neurons receiving polysynaptic input, CVIB reduced both the EPSC amplitude and the ""success rate"" calculated as the relative number of primary afferent stimulations that resulted in postsynaptic responses. These results indicate that (i) the analgesic action of omega-conotoxins that antagonise N-type VGCCs may be attributed to inhibition of neurotransmission between primary afferents and superficial dorsal horn neurons, (ii) nociceptive synaptic transmission between primary afferents and superficial lamina neurons is mediated predominantly by N-type VGCCs, and (iii) in contrast to the irreversible inhibition by CVID, MVIIA and GVIA, the inhibition of excitatory monosynaptic transmission by CVIB is reversible.",Excluded
3171,"Histopathological findings in a surgically resected thalamic cavernous hemangioma 1 year after 40-Gy irradiation Stereotactic radiosurgery is a controversial treatment modality in the management of cerebral cavernous hemangiomas (CHs), and results vary from center to center. Even the interpretation of treatment failure is controversial. It is suggested that the systematic pathological investigation of irradiated specimens could help to resolve the controversy. A hemorrhagic lesion in the posterior part of the thalamus had been diagnosed as a tumor and was treated with 40-Gy fractionated radiotherapy. One year after this treatment the case was reconsidered based on new imaging evidence, and the lesion was removed by conventional craniotomy. Histopathological examination revealed a CH with postirradiation changes. Compared with nonirradiated control CH tissue samples, there was endothelial cell destruction and marked fibrosis with scar tissue formation in the stroma of the treated lesion. The histopathological findings in this specimen were similar to those described in arteriovenous malformations after gamma knife surgery. The results of light microscopic investigations suggest that the ionizing effect of radiation energy evokes vascular and connective tissue stroma changes in CHs as well.",Excluded
3425,"Lymphatic leakage (ll) after resection of neuroblastoma Background/Objectives: Lymphangiogenesis and lymphangiogenic vessel remodeling is known to play an important role in cancer progression. Little is known about the impact of lymphangionesis in neuroblastoma. From a surgical point of view, lymphatic fistula is a potential complication after neuroblastoma surgery. Aim of this study was the evaluation of frequency and impact of lymphatic leakage in a center for neuroblastoma surgery. Design/Methods: Between 2003 and 2014, 210 patients (pts) were resected for neuroblastoma in our department for neuroblastoma. Out of these, 200 patients were eligible for this study. Patient charts were reviewed for INSS stage, surgical radicality, duration of abdominal or thoracic drainage and maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 h. Result(s): Out of 200 patients, 73 patients (37%) had a duration of drainage of 7 or more days. Maximum amount of drainage was 4 liters per day; longest duration of intraabdominal drainage was 91 days. In case of chylous fistula, all patients were treated with a conservative approach. Duration of drainage was significantly associated with surgical radicality (p=0.000). Furthermore, the duration of drainage was significantly associated with the maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 h (p=0.000). Lymphatic fistula was significantly associated with INSS stage (p=0.000). Overall Survival (OS) demonstrated a better OS for patients without LL (87% alive) than pts with LL (72% alive). OS was significantly associated with the maximum amount of fluid drained per 24 hrs (p=0.009), but not with duration of drainage. Conclusion(s): LL is a frequent complication after neuroblastoma surgery and in some cases with substantial loss of fluids and proteins. It can be treated in nearly all cases conservatively. One major problem is the delay of further chemotherapy and radiation which however does not seem to have a great impact on the prognosis.",Excluded
3541,"Feasibility, Safety, and Periprocedural Complications of Pipeline Embolization for Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment Under Conscious Sedation: University at Buffalo Neurosurgery Experience BACKGROUND: Endovascular Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) placement for intracranial aneurysms is performed under general anesthesia at most centers because of perceived improved image quality and patient safety.OBJECTIVE: To report the feasibility, safety, and outcomes associated with the use of the PED for intracranial aneurysms performed in awake patients after the administration of conscious sedation (CS) and a local anesthetic.METHODS: Between March 2012 and September 2014, 130 patients with 139 intracranial aneurysms (8 ruptured) were treated with the PED under CS at our institution. Procedure details and time (including duration, radiation exposure, and fluoroscopy) and procedure-related complications were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: A total of 155 PED deployment procedures were performed under CS. Treatment was successfully completed in all cases. Anesthesia was converted from CS to general anesthesia during 5 procedures. Mean interval from patient entry at the endovascular suite to procedure initiation was 18 minutes (range, 5 minutes-1 hour 10 minutes). Mean procedure length was 1 hour 25 minutes (range, 30 minutes-3 hours 51 minutes). Mean +/- SD values for fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure were 36.17 +/- 18.4 minutes and 1367 +/- 897 mGy, respectively. The mean amount of contrast material administered was 211.37 +/- 83.5 mL. Permanent neurological complications were seen in 4 patients (3%).CONCLUSION: In our experience, CS for PED placement for intracranial aneurysm treatment is feasible and safe. Procedure and fluoroscopy times and amount of radiation exposure are similar to or less than described in reports of PED placement under general anesthesia. CS allows direct neurological evaluation and earlier detection of and response to intraprocedural complications.",Excluded
2527,"Is autonomic modulation different between European and Chinese astronauts? PURPOSE: The objective was to investigate autonomic control in groups of European and Chinese astronauts and to identify similarities and differences.METHODS: Beat-to-beat heart rate and finger blood pressure, brachial blood pressure, and respiratory frequency were measured from 10 astronauts (five European taking part in three different space missions and five Chinese astronauts taking part in two different space missions). Data recording was performed in the supine and standing positions at least 10 days before launch, and 1, 3, and 10 days after return. Cross-correlation analysis of heart rate and systolic pressure was used to assess cardiac baroreflex modulation. A fixed breathing protocol was performed to measure respiratory sinus arrhythmia and low-frequency power of systolic blood pressure variability.RESULTS: Although baseline cardiovascular parameters before spaceflight were similar in all astronauts in the supine position, a significant increase in sympathetic activity and a decrease in vagal modulation occurred in the European astronauts when standing; spaceflight resulted in a remarkable vagal decrease in European astronauts only. Similar baseline supine and standing values for heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and respiratory frequency were shown in both groups. Standing autonomic control was based on a balance of higher vagal and sympathetic modulation in European astronauts.CONCLUSION: Post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was observed in all European astronauts, whereas post-spaceflight orthostatic tachycardia was significantly reduced in Chinese astronauts. The basis for orthostatic intolerance is not apparent; however, many possibilities can be considered and need to be further investigated, such as genetic diversities between races, astronaut selection, training, and nutrition, etc.",Excluded
3192,"Sequential changes in cerebral blood flow, early neuropathological consequences and blood-brain barrier disruption following radiofrequency-induced localized hyperthermia in the rat We investigated the temperature distribution, early histological changes, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and sequential changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) following hyperthermia ranging from 37 to 45 degrees C in a new rat model of radiofrequency-induced localized cerebral hyperthermia. Significant histological changes and BBB disruption were observed in brain regions heated to 43 degrees C and above. In the cortex heated to 41 degrees C, the CBF doubled 20 min after hyperthermia induction, and then returned gradually to the pre-hyperthermic level. In the cortex heated to 43 degrees C, the CBF increased to 134% of the baseline level 10 min after hyperthermia induction, and then fell gradually to reach its minimum level (31% of the baseline level). In the cortex heated to 45 degrees C, the CBF decreased immediately after hyperthermia induction to reach 10% of the baseline level. The results indicate that hyperthermia-induced cellular injury in the central nervous system is associated with cerebral ischaemia and the threshold temperature for such injury is 43 degrees C. This model is useful for investigating the effects of hyperthermia on various cerebral functions and the CBF changes demonstrated in the present study may provide key information for the analysis of other cerebral functions.",Excluded

In central nervous system (CNS), radiation damage to normal tissues is presented, in part, as suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired cognitive functions. Mn porphyrin (MnP)-based redox active drugs have demonstrated differential effects on cancer and normal tissues in experimental animals that lead to protection of normal tissues and radio- and chemo-sensitization of cancers. To test the efficacy of MnPs in CNS radioprotection, we first examined the tissue levels of three different MnPs - MnTE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnE), MnTnHex-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnHex), and MnTnBuOE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnBuOE). Nanomolar concentrations of MnHex and MnBuOE were detected in various brain regions after daily subcutaneous administration, and MnBuOE was well tolerated at a daily dose of 3mg/kg. Administration of MnBuOE for one week before cranial irradiation and continued for one week afterwards supported production and long-term survival of newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. MnP-driven S-glutathionylation in cortex and hippocampus showed differential responses to MnP administration and radiation in these two brain regions. A better understanding of how preserved hippocampal neurogenesis correlates with cognitive functions following cranial irradiation will be helpful in designing better MnP-based radioprotection strategies.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Spinal bone metastases associated with soft tissue disease (ST) are frequently considered at higher risk of developing further complications such as neuropathic pain and cord compression. The objectives of our study were to describe the prevalence of ST in patients presenting for spine radiation therapy (XRT), and whether presence of soft tissue disease is associated with a difference in treatment approach compared with those whose do not (nST). Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of all consecutive patients receiving spine XRT within our palliative radiation program during 2012. Patient demographics, symptoms intensity, performance status and life expectancy were captured at the time of consultation. Diagnostic imaging including CT +/- MRI as well as planning CT relevant to the course of treatment were reviewed to document whether ST, cord compression (CC) or compression fracture (CF) was present at the levels being irradiated. Whether a field based or volume based approach was employed by the radiation oncologist to define the treatment plan was recorded. Binary logistic regression was used for inferences, using the generalized estimating equation approach to adjust the standard error to account for the correlation of observations within a patient. Result(s): One hundred fifty patients receiving 177 treatments were reviewed. This included 19 patients receiving simultaneous treatment to 2 separate sites and 4 patients receiving treatment to 3 sites. The mean age was 64 years. 71% (106/150) of patients in both groups were estimated to have a life expectancy of over 6 months. Fifty-five percent of treatments given were in the lumbosacral area. Nocomplicating radiological features (i.e., noST, CC, CF) was present in 89/177 (50%) of cases. ST was present in 50/177 cases [28% [95% CI 25-32%)]. Of these,32%(16/50) also had aCCand 32%(16/50) had aCF. There were no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex distribution and source of primary. The proportion of patients with severe pain (>5 on a scale of 0-10) was 46% ST and 60% nST (p = 0.82). Volume based planning was employed for 58% ST and 48% nST. Fractionated treatments (mostly 20 Gy/ 5 fractions) were employed in 84% ST and 66% nST of cases. After adjustment for CC and CF, there was a trend to suggest physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated treatments in cases with ST (p =0.16). Conclusion(s): Fifty percent of treatment courses delivered to spine were associated with some complicating radiological features including ST, SC or CF. ST was present in 28% cases. We were unable to identify any clinical features that would predict for the presence of ST disease. There is a trend that physicians were more likely to prescribe fractionated radiation therapy when ST was present.",Excluded

Method(s): Retrospective review of 164 ARUBA-eligible patients having stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) from 1990-2005 with more than two years of follow-up. The median patient age was 42.8 years. Sixty-five AVMs (40%) were Spetzler-Martin grade I-II; the median radiosurgery-based AVM score (RBAS) was 1.48. The median follow-up was 67.5 months; 44 patients (27%) had 10 or more years of follow-up. Result(s): Fifteen patients (9%) bled at a median of 21 months (range, 7-70) after SRS. Six patients (4%) had new deficits and 4 patients died (2%). The risk of stroke was 10% at 5-years and 11% at 10-years. Twelve additional patients (7%) had a Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) decline from either radiation-related complications (n=7) or subsequent resection (n=5). The risk of MRS decline was 13% at 5-years and 16% at 10-years. Factors associated with MRS decline were increasing AVM volume (P=0.002), higher AVM grade (P=0.01), and higher RBAS (P=0.002). The 5-year and 10-year risk of MRS decline for patients with Spetzler- Martin grade I-II AVMs or a RBAS less than 1.5 was 5%. Conclusion(s): Although the observed risk of stroke and MRS decline after SRS was similar to the expected risk in the medical management group of ARUBA at the planned follow-up interval of that trial (5-year risk, 5%-20%), younger patients with small, unruptured AVMs may benefit from SRS compared to medical management at longer follow-up periods.",Excluded
3307,"Blocking GABAA neurotransmission in the interposed nuclei: effects on conditioned and unconditioned eyeblinks The interposed nuclei (IN) of the intermediate cerebellum are critical components of the circuits that control associative learning of eyeblinks and other defensive reflexes in mammals. The IN, which represent the sole output of the intermediate cerebellum, receive massive GABAergic input from Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex and are thought to contribute to the acquisition and performance of classically conditioned eyeblinks. The specific role of deep cerebellar nuclei and the cerebellar cortex in eyeblink conditioning are not well understood. One group of studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN altered the time profile of conditioned responses (CRs), suggesting that the main function of the cerebellar cortex is to shape the timing of CRs. Other studies reported that blocking GABA(A) neurotransmission in the IN abolished CRs, indicating a more fundamental involvement of the cerebellar cortex in CR generation. When examining this controversy, we hypothesized that the behavioral effect of GABA(A) blockers could be dose-dependent. The IN of classically conditioned rabbits were injected with high and low doses of picrotoxin and gabazine. Both GABA(A) blockers produced tonic eyelid closure. A high dose of both drugs abolished CRs, whereas a less complete block of GABA(A)-mediated inputs with substantially smaller drug doses shortened CR latencies. In addition, low doses of picrotoxin facilitated the expression of unconditioned eyeblinks evoked by trigeminal stimulation. These results suggest that the intermediate cerebellum regulates both associative and non-associative components of the eyeblink reflex, and that behavioral effects of blocking Purkinje cell action on IN neurons are related to collective changes in cerebellar signals and in the excitability of extra-cerebellar eyeblink circuits.",Excluded
3023,"[Late radiation changes after small volume radiosurgery of the rat brain. Measuring local cerebral blood flow and histopathological studies] BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate late effects following stereotactic single fraction and small volume irradiation on cerebral blood flow and histologic alterations in the rat brain parenchyma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 Copenhagen rats, separated into eleven groups of six animals each received single doses of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 Gy using a 15 MV linear accelerator. Six rats served as controls. Two cylindrical collimators of 2 mm and 3 mm aperture were used. The diameters of the spherical 80% isodose were 3.7 and 4.7 mm, respectively (Table 1). Irradiation was applied to a predefined area in the right frontal lobe. 19 months after irradiation local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by the autoradiographic method in one animal of each dose group between 20 and 50 Gy. 9 and 19 months after irradiation, half of the animals of each group were sacrificed for brain histology. All animals irradiated with 100 Gy were sacrificed 7 months after irradiation.RESULTS: An increase of local cerebral blood flow was measured in brain structures within the 80% isodose in animals irradiated with 50 Gy (Figure 3) compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Measurements close to necrotic areas showed a strong decrease of local cerebral blood flow (Figure 1). A volume increase of the irradiated hemisphere was seen after 19 months (Figure 2). The histologic examination after 19 months showed necrotic areas in the 30-50 Gy groups (Figure 4b) but not in the 20 Gy groups (Figure 4c). The animals who received 100 Gy demonstrated brain necrosis within 9 months after irradiation (Figure 4a). At both points in time the groups irradiated with the 3-mm collimator showed more pronounced histomorphologic and functional changes compared to the groups irradiated with the 2-mm collimator.CONCLUSION: Alterations of the local cerebral blood flow were measured as a late effect after single dose irradiation. The alterations of the local cerebral blood flow could be explained by the histomorphologic changes of the blood vessels. Using a semi-quantitative classification a dose, time and volume dependence for the endpoint radionecrosis was seen.",Included

The diode laser was applied for 15 min with an irradiance of 4.8 W/cm(2). Tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content of the irradiated area in the cerebral cortex was 19% higher than that of the non-treated area, whereas the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) content showed no significant difference. Laser irradiation at another wavelength (652 nm) had no effect on either ATP or ADP contents. The temperature of the tissue was increased by 4.4-4.7 degrees C during the irradiation of both wavelengths. These results suggest that the increase in tissue ATP content did not result from the thermal effect, but from a specific effect of the laser operated at the 830-nm wavelength.",Excluded
2776,"Incidental retinal phototoxicity associated with ingestion of photosensitizing drugs BACKGROUND: to report on the possible correlation between incident retinal phototoxicity and the use of photosensitizing drugs.METHODS: four patients were examined because of scotomas and visual loss after an incidental exposure to a strong light source. One patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash; one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens implantation. The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.RESULTS: on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure. Despite the visual recovery, non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected eyes.CONCLUSION: phototoxicity following incidental light exposure may occur in patients taking drugs of photosensitizing potential. Therefore, the thorough history of systemic drug ingestion should be obtained if patients have exposure to strong light sources.",Excluded
2700,"Brain enzyme histochemistry following stabilization by microwave irradiation The activities of various enzymes present in brain homogenates were assayed biochemically (a) with no pretreatment, (b) following a standard microwave treatment in saline and (c) after a standard microwave treatment in formalin. All enzyme activity was lost after the microwave - formalin in treatment. Following microwave - saline treatment, the activities of alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, isocitrate and succinate dehydrogenases were reduced. In contrast, the activities of lactate and malate dehydrogenases were unchanged, and that of acetylcholinesterase apparently increased. Analogous outcomes were seen following attempted histochemical demonstrations of these enzymes. Thus satisfactory histochemical demonstration of all enzymes was achieved (except with alkaline phosphatase, lactate and malate dehydrogenases) following the microwave-saline pretreatment. Since acid phosphatase, catalase and peroxidase were also successfully demonstrated, it seems that microwave-saline pretreatments permit both retention of sufficient enzyme activity for histochemical demonstration to occur and retention of sufficient structural integrity for critical morphological investigations. Since the failure to stain the sites of lactate and malate dehydrogenases is not due to microwave inactivation of these enzymes, their demonstration may be possible by varying the staining procedures.",Excluded
3505,"Effects of Proton and Combined Proton and (56)Fe Radiation on the Hippocampus The space radiation environment contains protons and (56)Fe, which could pose a significant hazard to space flight crews during and after missions. The space environment involves complex radiation exposures, thus, the effects of a dose of protons might be modulated by a dose of heavy-ion radiation. The brain, and particularly the hippocampus, may be susceptible to space radiation-induced changes. In this study, we first determined the dose-response effect of proton radiation (150 MeV) on hippocampus-dependent cognition 1 and 3 months after exposure. Based on those results, we subsequently exposed mice to protons alone (150 MeV, 0.1 Gy), (56)Fe alone (600 MeV/n, 0.5 Gy) or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations (protons first) with the two exposures separated by 24 h. At one month postirradiation, all animal groups showed novel object recognition. However, at three months postirradiation, mice exposed to either protons or combined proton and (56)Fe radiations showed impaired novel object recognition, which was not observed in mice irradiated with (56)Fe alone. The mechanisms in these impairments might involve inflammation. In mice irradiated with protons alone or (56)Fe alone three months earlier, there was a negative correlation between a measure of novel object recognition and the number of newly born activated microglia in the dentate gyrus. Next, cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed in the hippocampus. At one month after exposure the levels of IL-12 were higher in mice exposed to combined radiations compared with sham-irradiated mice, while the levels of IFN-gamma were lower in mice exposed to (56)Fe radiation alone or combined radiations. In addition, IL-4 levels were lower in (56)Fe-irradiated mice compared with proton-irradiated mice and TNF-alpha levels were lower in proton-irradiated mice than in mice receiving combined radiations. At three months after exposure, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and eotaxin levels were lower in mice receiving combined radiations. The levels of MDC and eotaxin correlated and the levels of MDC, but not eotaxin, correlated with the percentage of newly born activated microglia in the blades of the dentate gyrus. Finally, hippocampal IL-6 levels were higher in mice receiving combined radiations compared with mice receiving (56)Fe radiation alone. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of novel object recognition for detecting cognitive injury three months after exposure to proton radiation alone, and combined exposure to proton and (56)Fe radiations, and that newly-born activated microglia and inflammation might be involved in this injury.",Included

The microdistribution of the two neutron capture agents played a crucial role in the determination of the overall biological effect, after thermal neutron activation. BSH, which is excluded from the CNS parenchyma by the blood brain barrier, had a low CBE factor value of 0.46 +/- 0.5.

3069,"Plant polyphenols inhibit functional amyloid and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas strains by directing monomers to off-pathway oligomers Self-assembly of proteins to beta-sheet rich amyloid fibrils is commonly observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. However, amyloid also occurs in the extracellular matrix of bacterial biofilm, which protects bacteria from environmental stress and antibiotics. Many Pseudomonas strains produce functional amyloid where the main component is the highly fibrillation-prone protein FapC. FapC fibrillation may be inhibited by small molecules such as plant polyphenols, which are already known to inhibit formation of pathogenic amyloid, but the mechanism and biological impact of inhibition is unclear. Here, we elucidate how polyphenols modify the self-assembly of functional amyloid, with particular focus on epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), penta-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (PGG), baicalein, oleuropein, and procyanidin B2. We find EGCG and PGG to be the best inhibitors. These compounds inhibit amyloid formation by redirecting the aggregation of FapC monomers into oligomeric species, which according to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements organize into core-shell complexes of short axis diameters 25-26 nm consisting of ~7 monomers. Using peptide arrays, we identify EGCG-binding sites in FapC's linker regions, C and N-terminal parts, and high amyloidogenic sequences located in the R2 and R3 repeats. We correlate our biophysical observations to biological impact by demonstrating that the extent of amyloid inhibition by the different inhibitors correlated with their ability to reduce biofilm, highlighting the potential of anti-amyloid polyphenols as therapeutic agents against biofilm infections.

3049,"Comparison of the efficacy and safety of tropisetron, metoclopramide, and chlorpromazine in the treatment of emesis associated with far advanced cancer BACKGROUND. A single institution, prospective, randomized trial was performed in terminal cancer patients to compare tropisetron (TRO), metoclopramide (MET), and chlorpromazine (CHL) in the management of nausea and emesis. Patients had far advanced cancer, were far removed from chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and their nausea and emesis was not due to bowel obstruction, drug intake, or cranial, electrolytic, or metabolic causes. The effects of antiemetic treatments were evaluated from Days 1-15. METHODS. Two hundred and eighty patients were randomized to receive 1) MET+ dexamethasone (DEX) (10 mg*4 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 2) TRO (5 mg*l, orally), 3) TRO + MET (5 mg*l and 10 mg*2, respectively, orally), 4) TRO + MET + DEX (5 mg*l, 10 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 5) CHL + DEX (25 mg*2 and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally), 6) TRO + CHL (5 mg*l and 12.5 mg*2, respectively, orally), or 7) TRO + CHL + DEX (5 mg*l, 12.5 mg*2, and 2 mg*l, respectively, orally). Total control was defined as no nausea or emesis. RESULTS. By the end of the 15th day, total control of emesis was obtained in 23.6% (9 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 78.9% (30 of 38) of TRO patients, 84.2% (32 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 92.3% (36 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 33.3 (13 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 84.6% (33 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 92.5% (37 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. Total control of nausea was achieved in 18.4% (7 of 38) of MET + DEX patients, 65.7% (25 of 38) of TRO patients, 73.6% (28 of 38) of TRO + MET patients, 87.1% (34 of 39) of TRO + MET + DEX patients, 17.9% (7 of 39) of CHL + DEX patients, 74.3% (29 of 39) of TRO + CHL patients, and 85% (34 of 40) of TRO + CHL + DEX patients. When comparing MET + DEX versus TRO; MET + DEX versus TRO + MET; MET + DEX versus TRO + MET + DEX; MET + DEX versus TRO + CHL; MET + DEX versus TRO + CHL + DEX; CHL + DEX versus TRO; CHL + DEX versus TRO + MET; CHL + DEX versus TRO + MET + DEX; CHL + DEX versus TRO + CHL; and CHL + DEX versus TRO + CHL + DEX, significant differences were noted. All antiemetic drugs were well tolerated with no severe side effects observed in any treatment arm. C0NCLUSIONS. These data suggest that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as tropisetron clinically are more effective in the control of emesis of patients with far advanced cancer than previously used agents. This study raises important issues when attempting to decide which antiemetic therapy to choose for an individual patient with far advanced disease.",Excluded

[French] Purpose. - The main objective of this prospective multicenter randomised phase III study was to compare a combined regimen of fotemustine plus whole brain irradiation versus fotemustine alone in terms of cerebral response and time to cerebral progression in patients with melanoma brain metastases. Patients and methods. - Seventy-six patients (instead of the 106 planned patients; study was stopped after the interim analysis) were randomised receiving either fotemustine (arm A, n = 39) or fotemustine and whole brain irradiation (arm B, n = 37). Fotemustine was administered intravenously at 100 mg m<sup>-2</sup> on day 1, 8 and 15, followed by a 5-week rest period, then every 3 weeks in non-progressive patients. In arm B, a concomitant whole brain irradiation was performed at the total dose of 37.5 Gy (2.5 Gy/d<sup>-1</sup>, days 1-5, 3 consecutive weeks). Results. - Although patients who received fotemustine alone had worse prognostic factors, there was no significant difference in brain response (arm A: 7.4%, B: 10.0%) or control rates (objective response plus stable disease) after seven weeks (arm A: 30%, B: 47%) and overall survival (arm A: 86d, B: 105d). However, there was a significant difference in favour of arm B for the time to brain progression (p = 0.028, Wilcoxon test). Conclusion. - Fotemustine plus whole brain irradiation delayed the time to brain progression of melanoma cerebral metastases compared to fotemustine alone but without a significant improvement in terms of objective control or overall survival. © 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

3488,"A bayesian adaptive randomized phase ii trial of bevacizumab versus bevacizumab plus vorinostat in adults with recurrent glioblastoma final results BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab improves outcome and reduces symptoms in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). However, GBMs develop adaptive resistance to bevacizumab- mediated angiogenesis inhibition resulting in tumor recurrence. We hypothesized that vorinostat, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, with pleotropic antiangiogenic effects, would delay emergence of resistance to bevacizumab therapy and improve clinical outcome. METHOD(S): In this multicenter phase II trial utilizing a novel Bayesian design, patients with recurrent glioblastoma were adaptively randomized to bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab+vorinostat based on a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) such that patients had a higher likelihood of receiving the more efficacious treatment. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and quality of life assessment (MDASI-BT). Eligible patients were adults (>= 18 yrs) with histologically confirmed GBMs recurrent after prior radiation and temozolomide therapy, adequate organ function, KPS>= 60, and no prior bevacizumab/HDAC inhibitors. RESULT(S): Ninety patients (bevacizumab+vorinostat:49, bevacizumab:41) were enrolled and 74 were evaluable for PFS (bevacizumab+vorinostat:44, bevacizumab:30). Grade 3 or greater toxicities in 85 evaluable patients included hypertension (n=37), neurological changes (n=2), anorexia (n=2), infections (n=9), wound dehiscence (n=2), DVT/PE (n=2), and colonic perforation (n=1). There was one treatment-related death due to pulmonary embolism. Upon multivariate analysis for bevacizumab+vorinostat vs bevacizumab, median PFS (3.7 vs. 3.9 months, p=0.94, HR 0.63 [95% CI 0.38, 1.06, p=0.08]) or median OS (7.8 vs. 9.3 months, p=0.64, HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.5, 1.6, p=0.79]) were not significantly different between the two arms. Ongoing analyses of patient reported outcomes (MDASI-BT) and plasma biomarkers will be reported. CONCLUSION(S): Combining bevacizumab with vorinostat did not result in improved PFS or OS compared with bevacizumab alone in patients with recurrent GBM. This trial is the first to test a Bayesian PFSbased adaptive randomized design in patients with primary brain tumors and demonstrates the feasibility of using adaptive randomization in a multicenter setting.",Excluded

2748,"Accelerated intensity-modulated radiotherapy plus temozolomide in patients with glioblastoma: A phase i dose-escalation study (ISIDE-BT-1) Background: We performed a dose-escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with standard concurrent and sequential-dose temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Method(s): Histologically proven glioblastoma patients underwent IMRT dose escalation. IMRT was delivered over 5 weeks with the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique to the two planning target volumes (PTVs) defined by adding 5-mm margin to the respective clinical target volumes (CTVs). CTV1 was the tumor bed plus the enhancing lesion with 10-mm margin; CTV2 was the area of perifocal edema with 20-mm margin. Only the PTV1 dose was escalated (planned dose escalation: 60, 62.5, 65, 67.5, 70 Gy) while the PTV2 dose remained the same (45 Gy). Result(s): Forty consecutive glioblastoma patients were treated. While no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was recorded during the dose escalation up to 67.5/2.7 Gy, two out of the first six consecutively enrolled patients on the highest dose level (70/2.8 Gy) experienced a DLT, and therefore a cohort expansion was required. 3/14 patients experienced a DLT on the highest planned dose level, and therefore the MTD was not exceeded. After a median follow-up time of 25 months no grade >2 late neurological toxicity was recorded. Conclusion(s): By using a SIB IMRT technique, a radiation dose of 70 Gy in 25 fractions (biological effective dose - BED - of 92.8 Gy) can be delivered with concurrent and sequential standard dose TMZ, without unacceptable acute toxicity in patients with glioblastoma. © 2012 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
3258,"Whole-Body versus Routine Skull Base to Mid-thigh <sup>18</sup>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/ Computed Tomography in Patients with Malignant Melanoma Objectives: The objectives of this study are to assess the utility of whole-body <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT) (skull vertex to toes) imaging relative to the standard field of view (skull base to mid-thigh) in patients with primary melanoma site that is not located in the lower extremities.Material and Methods: The primary site of the melanoma and metastatic disease was determined based on <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT findings in 26 patients. The FDG avid sites were tabulated as the primary site, lower extremity, brain, and other sites. The hypothesis is that routine skull base to mid-thigh versus whole-body <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT in patients with malignant melanoma will not change management.Results: Patients (26) were divided into those with primary melanoma site in either the lower extremities (six patients) or other site (20 patients). Four of the six patients with the primary site in the lower extremities also had positive findings in the ipsilateral inguinal lymph nodes. One of the patients with a positive inguinal lymph node had metastatic sites in the external iliac region and lungs on the initial study. On follow-up imaging, this patient also exhibited diffuse metastatic disease, including a lower extremity. None of the remaining patients in this group had positive findings other than the primary site in the lower extremity. Of the remaining 20 patients with the primary site not in the lower extremity, one had diffuse metastatic disease that included a lower extremity. However, lower extremity involvement would not change patient management in this case. A second patient in this group had diffuse metastatic disease that also involved the brain. However, no metastatic disease was present in the lower extremities in this patient. None of the remaining 18 patients in this group had metastatic disease in a lower extremity. Two patients in the entire study group of 26 had brain metastasis on contrast-enhanced head CT, with one having multiple brain metastasis. PET failed to demonstrate some of the brain lesions. In the other patient with solitary brain metastasis detected on contrast-enhanced head CT, PET was negative.Conclusion: <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT imaging of the lower extremity may not be justified if the primary neoplasm is not located in the lower extremities. Elimination of lower extremity imaging will reduce scanning time and additional radiation exposure. Similarly, PET/CT imaging of the brain may not be justified if contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging of the head is already obtained since these are more sensitive.",Excluded
2653,"The efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy for metastases from renal cell carcinoma Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for intracranial and extracranial metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma. The retrospective analysis of 85 patients (151 tumors) treated with SRT was performed. SRT was the sole treatment in 35% of tumors, the other 65% had received additional treatment such as surgery, palliative radiotherapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy. In 60% and 40% of patients SRT was delivered to brain and extracranial lesions, respectively. The assessment of the efficacy of SRT was based on a radiological imaging (Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and estimation of Local Control (LC) as well as Overall Survival (OS). Single fraction was used for 104 tumors and fractionated treatment for 47 tumors. The crude LC for evaluable lesions was 81%, stratified by tumor location: brain LC=94%, extracranial tumors LC=70% (p=0.049). The median OS was 9.4 months; 1-year and 2-year OS were 40% and 29%, respectively. The additional treatment did not lead to a better local response (p=0,543), but resulted in a benefit in OS (7 vs 13 months, p=0,01). A positive relationship between the biologically effective dose (BED) and local response was noted, but the BED was influenced by a tumor volume (R=-0,38; p<0,00001). The presence of multi-organ metastases reduced the OS rate (8.7 vs 19.1 months; p=0,01). The interval between the diagnosis of the metastasis and its treatment with SRT was inversely related to OS (P=0.0001). SRT results in a good local response, which is more beneficial for brain than extracranial lesions. The local efficacy of the SRT depends on the radiation dose. Multidisciplinary treatment and earlier application of SRT improves the prognosis of patients. Copyright © 2016, Cancer Research Institute Slovak Acad. of Sciences. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3556,"Trends in radiotherapeutic management and outcomes in esophageal brain metastases Objective: To examine national practice patterns and survival outcomes in patients with brain metastases from an esophageal primary treated with intracranial radiation. Background(s): Brain metastasis from an esophageal primary are a rare occurrence, therefore clinical data regarding management and outcomes are limited. Intracranial radiotherapy in the form of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common treatment approaches in management of brain metastases, however the utilization patterns and efficacy of each technique in esophageal based brain metastasis are unknown. Design/Methods: We analyzed 289 stage IV esophageal cancer patients with documented brain metastasis treated with intracranial radiotherapy as reported by the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) between the years 2004-2014. The treatment arms included those receiving WBRT versus SRS. Univariable and multivariable analyses identified characteristics predictive of overall survival. Multivariable logistic regression identified co-variates associated with each treatment arm. Result(s): There were 230 patients in the WBRT group and 59 patients in the SRS group. With multivariable analysis, SRS receipt was an independent predictor of improved overall survival (HR=0.63, p=0.005) along with receipt of chemotherapy, lower comorbidity score, African American race, and absence of liver/bone metastases (p<0.01). Overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years for the WBRT was 17% and 4% (median OS: 4.5 months) compared to 32% and 12% (median OS: 6.9 months) for the SRS arm (p=0.004). Notably, patient age, tumor grade, histology, presence of lung metastasis, and sex were not associated with differences in OS. More recent treatment year was associated with receipt of SRS (p=0.03). Conclusion(s): In the largest known analysis of intracranial radiotherapy in esophageal brain metastases to date, receipt of SRS was associated with increased OS compared to WBRT. Given the limitations of a retrospective analysis, these findings require further investigation.",Excluded
3233,"Impact of Timing of Adjuvant Chemoradiation for Glioblastoma in a Large Hospital Database BACKGROUND: Although the standard of care for glioblastoma remains maximal safe resection followed by chemoradiation, conflicting reports have emerged regarding the importance of the time interval between these 2 treatments.OBJECTIVE: To assess whether differences in the duration between surgery and initiation of chemoradiation for glioblastoma had an impact on overall survival (OS) in a large hospital-based database.METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried to identify patients diagnosed with glioblastoma between 2010 and 2012 treated with surgery followed by chemoradiation. Patients who received biopsy only were excluded. The time from surgery to initiation of radiation therapy was divided into 4 equal quartiles of <=24, 25 to 30, 31 to 37, and >37 d. Patient characteristics were compared between groups using Pearson Chi Square and Fisher's Exact test. OS was analyzed via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared via the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression were performed to assess for impact of covariables on OS.RESULTS: A total of 11 652 patients were included in the analysis. Median duration from surgery to radiation was 30 d. On multivariable regression, black race, larger tumor, gross-total resection, methyguanine-methyl transferase (MGMT+), and treatment at an academic facility were associated with a duration >30 d. On multivariable analysis, there were no significant differences when comparing start within 24 d to 25 to 30 d (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-1.01, P = .13) or > 37 d (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91-1.03, P = .26), although a small OS improvement was seen if initiated within 31 to 37 d (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99, P = .02).CONCLUSION: There was no clear association between duration from surgery to initiation of chemoradiation on OS.",Excluded

However, abdominal CT is associated with high radiation exposure. Purpose To evaluate diagnostic performance of a reduced-dose 100 kVp CT protocol with advanced modeled iterative reconstruction as compared to a linearly blended 120 kVp protocol for assessment of acute, non-traumatic abdominal pain. Material and Methods Two radiologists assessed 100 kVp and linearly blended 120 kVp series of 112 consecutive patients with acute non-traumatic pain (onset < 48 h) regarding image quality, noise, and artifacts on a five-point Likert scale. Both radiologists assessed both series for abdominal pathologies and for diagnostic confidence. Both 100 kVp and linearly blended 120 kVp series were quantitatively evaluated regarding radiation dose and image noise. Comparative statistics and diagnostic accuracy was calculated using receiver operating curve (ROC) statistics, with final clinical diagnosis/clinical follow-up as reference standard. Results Image quality was high for both series without detectable significant differences ( P = 0.157). Image noise and artifacts were rated low for both series but significantly higher for 100 kVp ( P <= 0.021). Diagnostic accuracy was high for both series (120 kVp: area under the curve [AUC] = 0.950, sensitivity = 0.958, specificity = 0.941; 100 kVp: AUC >= 0.910, sensitivity >= 0.937, specificity = 0.882; P >= 0.516) with almost perfect inter-rater agreement (Kappa = 0.939). Diagnostic confidence was high for both dose levels without significant differences (100 kVp 5, range 4-5; 120 kVp 5, range 3-5; P = 0.134). The 100 kVp series yielded 26.1% lower radiation dose compared with the 120 kVp series (5.72 +/- 2.23 mSv versus 7.75 +/- 3.02 mSv, P < 0.001). Image noise was significantly higher in reduced-dose CT (13.3 +/- 2.4 HU versus 10.6 +/- 2.1 HU; P < 0.001).

2684,"Bremsstrahlung dose of 165Dy in radiosynovectomy There has been an increased interest in 165Dy radiossynovectomy, which emits relatively high-energy (> 1 MeV) beta rays. The production of in vivo bremsstrachlung radiation hazards warrants evaluation. The bremsstrahlung component of the decay scheme of 165Dy has been traditionally ignored in internal dosimetry calculations. We have estimated the bremsstrahlung dose of 165Dy distributed in muscle and bone to body by various internal organs (adrenals, brain, breasts, gallbladder wall, LLI wall, small intestine, stomach, ULI wall, heart wall, kidneys, liver, lungs, muscle, ovaries, pancreas, red marrow, bone surfaces, skin, spleen, testes, thymus, thyroid, urine bladder wall, uterus, fetus, placenta, and total body) during radiosynovictomy. In the present study, muscle and bone are considered to be source organs. These estimated values show that the bremsstrahlung radiation absorbed dose contribution from an organ to itself is very small compared to that originating from the beta source. However, contribution to other organs is not always negligible, especially when large amounts of 165Dy may be involved, such as in therapy applications. Hence the component of the total dose due to bremsstrahlung dose should be considered in radiosynovictomy or other therapy applications.",Excluded

The aim of this study is to explore prognostic factors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with brain metastases diagnosed by constrast-enhanced MRI after whole brain radiotherapy.METHODS: TA retrospective review of clinical data from 241 NSCLC patients with brain metastases received whole brain radiotherapy from April 2007 to October 2008 was performed. A number of potential factors that might affect prognosis after irradiation were evaluated. The significance of prognostic variables in the survival resulted from univariate analysis by Kaplan-Meier combining with Log-rank test, and the multivariate analysis was obtained by Cox regression model.RESULTS: Median follow-up time for the survivors was 19.1 months. For all patients, the median survival time (MST) was 8.7 months. By univariate analysis, female patients with KPS>70, no symptom when diagnosed with brain metastases, tumor controlled in the chest, and received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy and combined target therapy were the important factors for overall survival. By multivariate analysis, female, tumors controlled in the chest, and combined target therapy were independent prognostic factors for NSCLC patients with brain metastases. Tumor controlled in the chest was the most important independent prognostic factor.CONCLUSIONS: Gender, local tumor controlled, and combined target therapy significantly influenced NSCLC brain metastases diagnosed by constrast-enchanced MRI survival after whole brain radiotherapy.eciated patient subsets and is a useful method for dissecting complex clinical situations.

The aggressiveness by isolation in mice has been often used as a means for a better understanding of disturbed behavior in human beings. We found that male ICR white Swiss mice exhibiting isolation-induced aggression became gradually calm and showed remarkably quiet behavior 7 to 10 days after whole body irradiation of very low-dose X-rays (5-15 cGy). Higher doses (25-35 cGy), however, could not induce such effects. We also obtained the data on brain biochemistry giving a further support for the above low-dose effects on the mouse behavior. Brain serotonin turnover which has been known to be related to aggressive behavior in 5 or 15 cGy irradiated mice was faster than in aggressive control animals.",Included

We have extended these observations to cultured cortical neurons and studied the effect of EGb 761 on neuronal survival (evaluated as MTT reduction), the presence of condensed nuclei (monitored as Hoechst staining), the time-course of caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation (measured by cleavage of specific fluorescent substrates) and superoxide anion production (evaluated by hydroethidine staining) after the exposure to staurosporine. Results show that 200 mug/ml of EGb 761 increased cell survival and reduced the number of condensed nuclei after the exposure to 200 nM staurosporine. Vitamin E and the spin trapper alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) also significantly increased cell survival. In contrast, the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors ZVAD and ZBIOT showed no protection. Similarly, selective inhibitors of caspase-1 (YVAD-CHO), caspase-2 (VDVAD-CHO), caspase-3 (DEVD-CHO) and caspase-8 (IETD-CHO) did not protect against cell damage induced by staurosporine. The protective effect of EGb 761 was not enhanced when coincubated with vitamin E or DEVD-CHO. Caspase-3 activity was maximally induced 5-8 h after staurosporine exposure. Both EGb 761 and vitamin E showed a tendency to decrease caspase-3 activity. In contrast, activation of caspase-1 and caspase-9 was not observed at any of the times studied after STS exposure. Exposure to staurosporine resulted in increased superoxide production that was maximal at 5 h. EGb 761 significantly inhibited superoxide production at short times after staurosporine exposure. Vitamin E and PBN also significantly reduced superoxide production. Results suggest that EGb 761 neuroprotective effect might be mediated by its well-known antioxidant activity, which might also influence caspase-3 activation. Inhibition of capase-3 induced by EGb 761 and vitamin E does not seem to contribute to their observed protective action. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

However, most radiochemistry labs have limited capability to produce a second or even multiple <sup>11</sup>C-radiochemistry runs within the same day. Thus, we have re-configured two commercial radiosynthesis modules, the TRACERLab FXC Pro module (GE Healthcare) and the Auto-Loop 11CMethylation System (Eckert & Ziegler) to perform efficient and reliable multiple radiochemistry procedures of [11 C]DPA-713 and [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride for clinical use on the same day. Method(s): Two 3-way valves were installed on the FXC Pro module to connect with the Auto-Loop system for transferring either [<sup>11</sup>C]MeI or [<sup>11</sup>C]MeOTF for their respective reactions (See Figure 1). [<sup>11</sup>C]CH<inf>3</inf>I and [<sup>11</sup>C]CH3 OTF were produced in FXC Pro from cyclotron delivered [<sup>11</sup>C]CO<inf>2</inf> via reduction, iodination, and triflation. Further methylation with the prosthetic group in the FXC Pro: 1.0 mg of precursor (for [<sup>11</sup>C]DPA-713 or [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride) with NaOH was dissolved in 0.4 mL acetone in the reactor. After the C-11 methylation reaction was complete, the mixture was injected onto the HPLC for purification. Auto-Loop System: 1.0 mg of precursor (for [<sup>11</sup>C]DPA-713 or [11 C]raclopride) with NaOH were dissolved in 0.1 mL of 2-butanone then pre-loaded onto 2 mL loop. After [<sup>11</sup>C]MeOTF was trapped and reacted in the loop for 2 min, the crude mixture was injected onto HPLC for purification.

The newly installed two 3-way valves were remotely operated and can easily distribute [<sup>11</sup>C]MeI or [<sup>11</sup>C]MeOTF either to the reactor in FXC Pro or the capillary loop in Auto-Loop System. FXC Pro can stand alone for first <sup>11</sup>C-radioparmaceutical and be quickly switched to Auto-Loop System for next 11Cradiochemistry afterward. Furthermore, there is less radiation exposure to the radiochemist when he/she is using Auto-Loop System - thus, the use of the Auto-Loop will provide a safer option when the daily <sup>11</sup>C-production frequency increases. Currently, our facility can produce 3 clinical grade of [<sup>11</sup>C]DPA-713 or [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride on the same day but expect this number to increase in the near future.

2677,"Melatonin mitigates oxidative damage and apoptosis in mouse cerebellum induced by high-LET 56Fe particle irradiation Cerebellum is a vital organ responsible for the motor coordination and recently it has been reported to be involved in cognitive function. Reactive oxygen species are implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders because of higher vulnerability of neuronal tissues. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the role of melatonin against high-LET (linear energy transfer) (56)Fe particle irradiation-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the mouse cerebellum. Radiation-induced oxidative damage was examined using a neuronal-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL), quantitative histopathology, DNA damage (comet assay), carbonyl content and 4-HAE + MDA (4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde) status of the cerebellum. Radiation exposure augmented the number of TUNEL positive cell, DNA migration in the comet tail and carbonyl and 4-HAE + MDA level in the cerebellum. Melatonin pretreatment significantly inhibited the oxidative damage to biomolecules as well as cerebellar apoptosis. Melatonin-treated irradiated mice showed higher counts of intact Purkinje cells as compared to vehicle-treated irradiated mice. In addition, radiation induced augmentation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and a decline in the total antioxidant capacity in serum; these changes were also ameliorated by melatonin pretreatment. The present results provide evidence supporting the antioxidant and neuroprotective function of melatonin.",Included

Some brain metastases demonstrate significant peritumoral edema; radiation may induce cerebral edema or worsening preexisting edema. This study was conducted to evaluate the imaging and neurobehavioral outcomes in patients with preexisting peritumoral edema who then undergo GKS.METHODS: Between August 2003 and January 2008, 63 cases of brain metastasis with significant peritumoral edema (> 20 cm(3)) were prospectively studied. The study inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a single metastatic lesion with significant edema (perilesional edema signal volume on FLAIR > 20 cm(3)); and 2) inclusion of only 1 lesion > 20 cm(3) in the study (in cases of multiple lesions noted on FLAIR images). All patients received MR imaging with pulse sequences including T1-weighted imaging and FLAIR with or without contrast and T2-weighted imaging at an interval of 3 months. A neurological assessment and Brain Cancer Module (BCM-20) questionnaire were obtained every 2-3 months. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used for analysis of survival and associated factors.RESULTS: At the time of GKS, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 70 (range 50-90), and the mean BCM-20 score was 45.5 +/- 6.1. The mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) was 5.2 +/- 4.6 cm(3) with corresponding T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volumes of 59.25 +/- 37.3 and 62.1 +/- 38.8 cm(3), respectively (R(2) = 0.977, p < 0.001). The mean edema index (volume of peritumoral edema/tumor volume) was 17.5 +/- 14.5. The mean peripheral and maximum GKS doses were 17.4 +/- 2.3 and 35 +/- 4.7 Gy, respectively. The median survival was 11 months. The longer survival was related to KPS scores >or= 70 (p = 0.008), age < 65 years (p = 0.022), and a reduction of > 6 in BCM-20 score (p = 0.007), but survival was not related to preexisting edema or tumor volume. A reduction in BCM-20 score of > 6 was related to decreased volume in T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging (p < 0.001). Thirty-eight (79.2%) of 48 patients demonstrated decreased tumor volume and accompanied by decreased T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR volume. Eight (16.7%) of the 48 patients exhibited increased or stable tumor volume. A margin dose > 18 Gy was more likely to afford tumor reduction and resolution of peritumoral edema (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006, respectively). However, prior external-beam radiation therapy correlated with worsened preexisting peritumoral edema (p = 0.013) and longer maintenance of corticosteroids (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients demonstrating a reduction in the BCM-20 score > 6, age < 65 years, and KPS score >or= 70 exhibited longer survival. Significant preexisting edema did not influence the tumor response or clinical outcome. The resolution of edema was related to better quality of life but not to longer survival.",Excluded

3446,"Dosimetric and clinical impact of 3D vs. 2D planning in palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases PURPOSE: The incorporation of three-dimensional (3D) planning for the treatment of bone metastases has been embraced in many North American practices with assumed superior tumor targeting, sparing of normal structures, and improvement in patient outcomes. The goal of our project was to evaluate the dosimetric and clinical impact of 3D vs. two-dimensional (2D) planning for patients who require simple palliative radiotherapy techniques (<= 2 beams) for bone metastases.METHODS: Patients undergoing palliative radiation therapy for bone metastases were eligible. The study oncologists first documented the intended treatment target, defined the treatment target/field using digital radiographs (2D), followed by using full 3D planning computerized tomography volumetric datasets. Treatment plans were compared dosimetrically, and patient-reported outcomes (pain, fatigue, anorexia, and nausea) were compared against a historical cohort treated with 2D plans.RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled in the study group. Review of the 3D datasets led to changes in the target area of interest in 44/85 (52 %) of cases, of which 21/85 (25 %) were clinically significant. 3D plans resulted in superior target coverage and normal tissue sparing. There was no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes however.CONCLUSION: 3D radiotherapy planning resulted in superior treatment plans but we were unable to demonstrate a significant benefit in clinical outcomes. Prospective study designs are needed to describe the contemporary expectation of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases in the modern era of 3D planning.",Excluded

Method(s): 233 patients with 257 meningeoma of the skull base (71.2%), falx (12.1%), convexity (14.4%) and meningeomatosis (2.3%) were treated between 01/2002 and 01/2015 at the Erlangen University Hospital. 81.7% (210) of patients received SRT postoperatively and 18.3% (47) as primary treatment. 119 (46.3%) had a WHO grade I, 64 (24.9%) grade II, 16 (6.2%) grade III meningioma. In 58 cases no histology was obtained, whereas 47 (18.3%) of which received SRT alone. SRT was given in 28 or 30 fractions. The lesion (PTV) received a median reference dose of 54.0 (range: 35.50- 66.60) Gy in single fraction of 1.80 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up at the time of overall survival (OS) analysis was 38.10 (range: 0.46-130.03) months. Local control rate was 97% at 5- and 83% at 10 years.

In this study we evaluated the changes induced by maternal exposure to delta 9-THC (5 mg/kg per day) from gestational day 5 to postnatal day 24 in eight discrete brain areas on the central serotoninergic system in both adult male and female rats. These result show that maternal exposure to delta 9-THC from gestational day 5 to postnatal day 24 affects development of the various central indoleaminergic system of the offsprings brain. Perinatal exposure to delta 9-THC decreased the levels of 5-HT in hypothalamus and rostral neostriatum in exposed males, and also decreased the levels of 5-HT in ventral hippocampus, septum, and midbrain raphe nuclei in both exposed males and females. Perinatal exposure to delta 9-THC increased the levels of 5-HIAA in dorsal hippocampus, hypothalamus, septum, midbrain raphe nuclei, and rostral neostriatum in exposed males and females.

Our particular research interest is in developing DLC as a coating material for implants and electrical devices for the nervous system. We previously reported that DLC is not toxic to N2a neuroblastoma cells or primary cortical neurons and showed that phosphorus-doped DLC (P:DLC) could be used to produce patterned neuron networks. In the present study we complement and extend these findings by exploring patterning of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants, human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) and U-87 astroglioma cells on P:DLC. Further P:DLC data is provided to highlight that P:DLC can be used as an effective coating material for in vitro multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) with potential for patterning groups of neurons on selected electrodes. We also introduce ultraviolet (UV) irradiation as a simple treatment to render DLC neurocompatible. We show that UV:DLC can be used to support patterned and unpatterned cortical neuron growth. These findings strongly support the use of DLC as tailorable and tuneable substrate to study neural cell biology in vitro and in vivo.

Signals in the medulla oblongata arise as a result of the hierarchic interaction of the brain structures. Neural signals originating there in the form of bursts of impulses conduct to the heart along the vagus nerves and after interaction with cardiac pacemaker structures, cause generation of the cardiac pulse in exact accordance with the frequency of ""neural bursts"". The intrinsic cardiac rhythm generator (the sinus node) is a life-sustaining factor that maintains the heart pumping function when the central nervous system is in a stage of deep inhibition, (e.g., under anesthesia or during unconsciousness). The brain generator is the factor that provides heart adaptive reactions in behaving organism.

3244,"Benefts of head tilting for brain PET-CT examinations The main goal of the current study is to think over the aspects of head positioning for brain examinations, focusing on mainly one field of view (FOV) PET/CT acquisitions. The image quality, radiation exposure of the eye lenses, streaking artefact due to the beam hardening of the skull, patient comfort, orientation of the reconstructed images were all considered in this study. Method(s): while the brain centered in the PET field of view, the degree of tilting the patient's chin toward to the chest were examined. Reconstructed CT images of anonymized patients were retrospectively evaluated. From the perspective of PET image quality the PET FOV on the CT image were simulated, then the number of significant voxels of the brain tissue close to the FOV boarders were plotted as a function of the tilt angle. On the same way the path of the radiation exposure in the brain were analysed. We introduced a simple wedge-shape insert placed under the head holder into our routine brain examinations according to our initial results. Patients were reported in connection with the comfort during the examination. Result(s): we found that the range of 20-25 degree is the optimal range to tilt the head toward to the chest. As a result of tilting the head, the reconstructed axial slices for both the CT and the PET are ft for supra orbito-meatalis line. It decreases the asymmetries caused by wrong orientation, and can take unnecessary the reorientation of the images as a post-processing step, prior the medical reporting. In most cases it results that the eyes are out of the CT scan range, which is particularly important, since the eyes have high risk for radiation exposure. The location of CT streaking artefacts moves down to the direction of cerebellum. In general because the tilting of the head, the perpendicular projection of the brain to the scan axis is significantly shorter, which means 10-15% dose reduction. Furthermore the noise-as a result of the low sensitivity of PET on the FOV boarders-has smaller effect on the diagnostic value of reconstructed PET image. There is no noticeable advantage or disadvantage related to the patient comfort. Conclusion(s): tilting the head with 20-25 degree results an overall improvement in image quality and dose reduction.

Introduction of novel chemotherapeutic and biologic agents and newer radiation techniques in the past decade has led to better control of systemic disease raising the possibility of increasing incidence of brain metastases as well as better control of CNS disease. The aim of this study was to determine the survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases in our practice in the last 10 years. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart analysis and we analyzed the charts of 18 patients with breast cancer who had developed brain metastases. The parameters analyzed included patient age at diagnosis of breast cancer and at development of brain metastases, receptor status and various treatment modalities used to control local as well as Metastatic disease. Result(s): The median survival time after adjusting for age at diagnosis of breast cancer, age at diagnosis of brain metastases and the number of brain metastases was 55 months. The time to death was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model, adjusting for age and number of brain metastases. Age at diagnosis of breast cancer was significant with a p-value of 0.007 and the number of brain metastases was not significant with a p-value of 0.55.

Specific health hazards, among them radiation of cosmic origin, have caused some concern among aircrew in civil aviation in recent years. Several cohort studies in Northern countries have investigated mortality and cancer incidence among aircrew. Our goal was to study the pattern of mortality among Greek commercial airline cockpit and cabin crew. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study including 843 Olympic Airways cockpit crew and 1835 cabin attendants. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated based on death rates of the Greek population. Duration of employment as a proxy for occupational exposure was used to stratify the cohort. Results. For cockpit crew, the overall SMR was 0.7 (n = 65, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9). The SMR for all cancers was also significantly decreased (n = 17; SMR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Most of this reduction was due to a large deficit in lung cancer deaths (SMR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0-0.5). Slight but non-significant increases were noted for brain and liver cancer. The SMR for cardiovascular death was close to unity. Among female cabin attendants the SMR for all causes was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.4-1.3). The SMR for all cancers was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3-1.7). Mortality from breast cancer was not increased. Among male cabin crew, SMR for all causes was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Analyses according to duration of employment showed no pattern. Conclusions. In this first-ever occupational cohort study in Greece, Greek aircrew had a low overall and cancer mortality. Due to the small number of events, the strength of our study is limited.

Therefore, this study compared clinical CCA plans with re-planned DCA plans using conformity index (CI) and V12Gy (volume of normal brain tissue receiving 12 Gy or higher) from a perspective of asymmetry (Asym) of planning target volume (PTV).METHODS: Ninety-five clinical CCA plans delivered for a small single lesion with PTV size < 1.4 cm<sup>3</sup> were selected and re-planned using DCA. PTV Asym (%) was defined and calculated from three dimensions of PTV. A pair of the 95 plans was first considered as one group without grouping and then categorized into two groups with respective to either PTV size or PTV Asym, and four groups with respect to PTV size and PTV Asym. For grouping, median values of PTV size and PTV Asym were used. A non-parametric paired test was performed for CI and V12Gy to compare CCA and DCA plans in each group.RESULTS: Median values of PTV size and PTV Asym were 0.415 cm<sup>3</sup> (range: 0.076 cm<sup>3</sup>-1.369 cm<sup>3</sup>) and 6.12% (range: 0.52-25.74%), respectively. DCA plans had a lower average CI value than CCA plans for all groups. CCA plans had a smaller average V12Gy value than DCA plans for lesions with PTV Asym <=6.12%, while CCA and DCA plans had similar average V12Gy values for lesions with PTV Asym > 6.12%.CONCLUSIONS: The DCA technique is recommended when a lesion has PTV Asym > 6.12% regardless of PTV size.

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of surgically treated PCMs larger than 2 cm.METHODS: A series of 199 consecutive patients (137 females, 68.8 %) with PCMs larger than 2 cm from between 1993 and 2003 were included. The clinical charts, radiographs, and follow-ups were evaluated.RESULTS: Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 111 (55.8 %) patients, subtotal resection (STR) in 65, and partial resection (PR) in 23. Cranial nerve dysfunctions were the most common complications and occurred in 133 (66.8 %) cases. The surgical mortality was 2.0 %. The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores significantly decreased 1 month after the operations (preoperative KPS = 76.8 and postoperative KPS = 64.8; p = 0.011, Paired-samples t test). Long-term follow-ups were obtained in 142 patients, the follow-up duration was 171.6 months, and the most recent KPS was 83.2. Permanent morbidities remained in 24 patients (18.9 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that brainstem edema and tumors larger than 4 cm in diameter were independent risk factors in terms of outcomes (KPS < 80).

Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the remnants exhibited good tumor control.CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes and low mortality were achieved with the microsurgical management of medium and large PCMs; however, the rates of cranial nerves dysfunction remained high. Radically aggressive resection might not be judicious in terms of postoperative morbidity. The preoperative evaluations and intraoperative findings were informative regarding the outcomes. The low follow-up rate likely compromised our findings, and additional consecutive studies were required.",Excluded
3099,"[Otolaryngological cancer pain at the after-effects stage] The standards of pharyngolaryngeal tumor treatment have changed over the years in an attempt to prevent laryngeal mutilation (partial surgery, endoscopic surgery, sequential radiotherapy, and chemotherapy). Pain induced by these treatments is frequent and varies from one treatment to another. Chemoradiotherapy induces less pain but often more severe pain, since 20% of these situations are not controlled by strong opioids. Pain from mucositis, although nonspecific to otolaryngic cancer, is more frequent and more severe, and prevention and treatment remain poorly defined. Pain from postradiotherapeutic necrosis (mandibula, laryngeal cartilage, etc.) is less frequent, delayed, and extremely severe. Cervical and shoulder pain is present in more than one-third of patients and stems from a number of mechanisms (myofascial and articulatory).

2864,"Increased activity and involvement of caspase-3 in radiation-induced apoptosis in neural cells precursors from developing rat brain Using primary cultures of neural precursor cells of cortex from developing rat brain, we demonstrated the involvement of caspase-3 in the apoptotic process induced by gamma irradiation. The precursor nature of cells was confirmed by nestin and GFAP immunoreactivity and by the capacity of differentiation in neuronal and glial cells after 5 days in culture. Neural precursors were irradiated with single doses ranging from 0.1 to 4Gy. Cellular death, determined 24 h post-irradiation (pi) was dose-dependent and the induction of apoptosis was confirmed by nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and hypodiploid DNA peak represented by the ""sub G1"" region. For the higher doses, apoptosis was evident after 4-6 h pi and increased during 24 h. Caspase-3 activity increased with doses and was maximal at 4-6 h pi with 3Gy and remained similar with 4Gy. The protection from radiation-induced apoptosis by caspase-3 inhibitor, zDEVD-fmk, confirmed that this enzyme is involved in the apoptotic mechanism in this system. The possibility of using this tissue culture system for studying the effects of ionizing radiation on morphological and molecular differentiation was considered.",Excluded
3077,"Regulation of motoneuron excitability via motor endplate acetylcholine receptor activation Motoneuron populations possess a range of intrinsic excitability that plays an important role in establishing how motor units are recruited. The fact that this range collapses after axotomy and does not recover completely until after reinnervation occurs suggests that muscle innervation is needed to maintain or regulate adult motoneuron excitability, but the nature and identity of underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report the results of experiments in which we studied the effects on rat motoneuron excitability produced by manipulations of neuromuscular transmission and compared these with the effects of peripheral nerve axotomy. Inhibition of acetylcholine release from motor terminals for 5-6 d with botulinum toxin produced relatively minor changes in motoneuron excitability compared with the effect of axotomy. In contrast, the blockade of acetylcholine receptors with alpha-bungarotoxin over the same time interval produced changes in motoneuron excitability that were statistically equivalent to axotomy. Muscle fiber recordings showed that low levels of acetylcholine release persisted at motor terminals after botulinum toxin, but endplate currents were completely blocked for at least several hours after daily intramuscular injections of alpha-bungarotoxin. We conclude that the complete but transient blockade of endplate currents underlies the robust axotomy-like effects of alpha-bungarotoxin on motoneuron excitability, and the low level of acetylcholine release that remains after injections of botulinum toxin inhibits axotomy-like changes in motoneurons. The results suggest the existence of a retrograde signaling mechanism located at the motor endplate that enables expression of adult motoneuron excitability and depends on acetylcholine receptor activation for its normal operation.",Excluded
3419,"The influence of arc weights on the dose distribution for single target radiosurgery To stereotactically irradiate ellipsoidal inclined arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with a single isocenter one can use an adjusted inclined irradiation space with a reduced angular range of arcs. If one uses the maximum available irradiation space it is necessary to weight some of the arcs in order to closely encompass the lesion. It has been found that there is a relationship between the lesion inclination angle beta and the weights of arcs. Conversely when the beta angle is known, the weights of the arcs can be determined in advance by means of weighting vectors. The dose volume analysis shows that the isodose volumes remain constant for the different weighting vectors except for the 10% isodose volume which increases slightly as the linear weighting vector's slope alpha increases. Moreover, this procedure permits the optimization of the superimposition between the lesion and the reference isodose. These results enable the construction of an ""a priori knowledge"" database that can be included in an optimization algorithm procedure.",Excluded
3471,"Novel risk stratification score for predicting early distant brain failure and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to evaluate predictors of early distant brain failure (DBF) and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases and create a clinically relevant risk score to stratify patients' risk for these events. METHODS The records of 270 patients with brain metastases who were treated with SRS between 2003 and 2012 were reviewed. Pretreatment patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. The cumulative incidences of first DBF and salvage WBRT were calculated. Significant factors were used to create a score for stratifying early (6-month) DBF risk. RESULTS No prior WBRT, a total lesion volume < 1.3 cm<sup>3</sup>, primary breast cancer or malignant melanoma histology, and multiple metastases (>=2) were found to be significant predictors of early DBF. Each factor was ascribed 1 point because of similar hazard ratios. Scores of 0 to 1, 2, and 3 to 4 were considered to indicate low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. This correlated with 6-month cumulative incidences of DBF of 16.6%, 28.8%, and 54.4%, respectively (P < .001). For patients without prior WBRT, the 6-month cumulative incidence of salvage WBRT was 2%, 17.7%, and 25.7%, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Early DBF after SRS requiring salvage WBRT remains a significant clinical problem. Patient stratification for early DBF can better inform the decision for the initial treatment strategy for brain metastases. The provided risk score may help to predict early DBF and subsequent salvage WBRT if SRS is initially used. External validation is needed before clinical implementation. Cancer 2015;121:3836-3843.

3255,"Evaluation of absorbed dose in respiratory-gated radiotherapy using a phantom system that simulates patient respiration. [Japanese] Respiratory-gated (RG) radiotherapy is useful for minimizing the irradiated volume of normal tissues resulting from the shifting of internal structures caused by respiratory movement. In this technique, although improvement in the dose distribution of the target can be expected, the actual absorbed dose distribution is not clearly determined. Therefore, it is important to clarify the absorbed dose at the tumor and at the evaluation points according to the patient's respiration. We have developed a phantom system that simulates patient respiration (TNK Co., Ltd.), to evaluate the absorbed dose and ensure precise RG radiotherapy. Actual patient respiratory signals were obtained using a respiratory synchronization and gating system (AZ-733V, Anzai Medical). The acquired data were then transferred to a phantom system driven by a ball screw to simulate the shifting of internal structures caused by respiratory movement. We measured the absorbed dose using a micro-ionization chamber dosimeter and the dose distribution using the film method for RG irradiation at expiratory phase by using Linac (PRIMUS, Toshiba Medical Systems Corp.) X-rays. When the distance of phantom movement was set to the average patient respiratory movement distance of 1.5 cm, we first compared absorbed dose with RG irradiation with a gating signal of 50% or less, and without RG irradiation. The absorbed dose at the iso-center was improved by 6.0% and 4.4% at a field size of 4x4 cm2, and by 1.3% and 0.7% at a field size of 5x5 cm2 with an X-ray energy of 6 MV and 10 MV, respectively. There was, however, no dose change at a field size of 10x10 cm2 and 15x15 cm2. When the gating signal was reduced to 25% and 10%, absorbed dose was also improved. With regard to the flatness of the dose profile, no changes in dose distribution were observed in the lateral direction, e.g., beam flatness was within 1.4% and 1.6% at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively, with an X-ray energy of 6 MV. In the cranial-caudal direction, the dose profile was relatively large even if a gating signal of 50% was applied, i.e., 8.1% and 10.4% at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively. Beam flatness without RG was much worse, i.e., 37.8% and 38.2%, at field sizes of 5x5 cm2 and 10x10 cm2, respectively. In both cases, the dose was insufficient in the expiratory direction. Although RG radiotherapy is quite useful, the margins in the inspiratory and expiratory phases should be considered based on the level of gating signal and field size in order to formulate appropriate radiotherapy planning in terms of the shifting of internal structures. To ensure accurate radiotherapy, the characteristics of the RG irradiation technique and the radiotherapy equipment must be clearly understood when this technique is to be employed in clinical practice.",Excluded

3414,"Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for recurrent, residual, or untreated skull-base meningiomas: preliminary clinical experience OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for complex-shaped benign meningiomas of the skull base and report clinical experience.METHODS: Twenty patients with benign skull-base meningiomas WHO degrees I (histopathologically proven in 16/20) were treated with IMRT between June 1998 and August 1999. Each tumor was complex in shape and adherent to, or encompassed, organs at risk (cranial nerves, optic apparatus, and brainstem). All patients, immobilized in a customized head mask integrated into a stereotactic system, were planned on an inverse treatment planning system using 5 or 7 coplanar, equidistant beams and 5 intensity steps. Each treatment plan was verified extensively before treatment. Follow-up with MRI and clinical examination was performed at 6 and 18 weeks and every 6 months thereafter.RESULTS: Target volumes ranged from 27 to 278 cc (median: 108 cc). Mean dose in 32 fractions ranged between 55.8 and 58.2 Gy. At median follow-up of 36 months (range: 31-43 months), pre-existing neurologic symptoms improved in 12/20 (60%), remained stable in 7/20 (35%), and worsened in 1 (5%) patient. Radiographic follow-up revealed significant tumor shrinkage 6 weeks post-IMRT in 2 patients and partial remission in 3 more patients at 9-17 months; other tumor volumes remained stable. There was no radiation-induced peritumoral edema, increase in tumor size, or new onset of neurologic deficits. Transient acute treatment side effects included nausea and vomiting and single occurrences of conjunctivitis/increased tearing and serous tympanitis.CONCLUSION: IMRT in the treatment of central nervous system meningiomas is feasible and safe, offering highly conformal irradiation for complex-shaped skull-base tumors while sparing adjacent critical structures. If the tumor remissions seen here are found in the ongoing treatments, IMRT may be considered the treatment of choice for inoperable or subtotally resected meningiomas and for otherwise difficult-to-treat, complex-shaped tumors of the central nervous system adjacent to critical structures, with the potential of dose escalation for malignant tumors.",Excluded

2889,"Piracetam inhibits the lipid-destabilising effect of the amyloid peptide Abeta C-terminal fragment Amyloid peptide (Abeta) is a 40/42-residue proteolytic fragment of a precursor protein (APP), implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The hypothesis that interactions between Abeta aggregates and neuronal membranes play an important role in toxicity has gained some acceptance. Previously, we showed that the C-terminal domain (e.g. amino acids 29-42) of Abeta induces membrane permeabilisation and fusion, an effect which is related to the appearance of non-bilayer structures. Conformational studies showed that this peptide has properties similar to those of the fusion peptide of viral proteins i.e. a tilted penetration into membranes. Since piracetam interacts with lipids and has beneficial effects on several symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, we investigated in model membranes the ability of piracetam to hinder the destabilising effect of the Abeta 29-42 peptide. Using fluorescence studies and 31P and 2H NMR spectroscopy, we have shown that piracetam was able to significantly decrease the fusogenic and destabilising effect of Abeta 29-42, in a concentration-dependent manner. While the peptide induced lipid disorganisation and subsequent negative curvature at the membrane-water interface, the conformational analysis showed that piracetam, when preincubated with lipids, coats the phospholipid headgroups. Calculations suggest that this prevents appearance of the peptide-induced curvature. In addition, insertion of molecules with an inverted cone shape, like piracetam, into the outer membrane leaflet should make the formation of such structures energetically less favourable and therefore decrease the likelihood of membrane fusion.",Excluded

Relevant stenosis was defined as diameter reduction > or =50%. During CTA, arrhythmias were present in 42 (30%) patients who were not excluded from the analysis.RESULTS: The assessment of stenosis or occlusion of bypass grafts resulted in a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 97%, and positive and negative predictive values of 93% and of 99%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy for the detection of graft occlusion or stenosis did not differ between arterial and venous grafts. The evaluability of bypass grafts was significantly lower in patients with arrhythmias or with heart rates > or =65 beats/min during scanning. However, in the assessment of evaluable bypass grafts, no significant differences were detected in the diagnostic accuracy in these subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: This large prospective study demonstrates that 64-slice CTA is a reliable method for the assessment of bypass graft patency and stenoses even in an unselected ""real-world"" patient population.",Excluded

3354,"Radio frequency radiation-related cancer: assessing causation in the occupational/military setting BACKGROUND AND AIM: We reexamine whether radio frequency radiation (RFR) in the occupational and military settings is a human carcinogen.METHODS: We extended an analysis of an already-reported case series of patients with cancer previously exposed to whole-body prolonged RFR, mainly from communication equipment and radar. We focused on hematolymphatic (HL) cancers. We used analysis by percentage frequency (PF) of a cancer type, which is the proportion of a specific cancer type relative to the total number of cancer cases. We also examined and analyzed the published data on three other cohort studies from similar military settings from different countries.RESULTS: The PF of HL cancers in the case series was very high, at 40% with only 23% expected for the series age and gender profile, confidence interval CI95%: 26-56%, p<0.01, 19 out of 47 patients had HL cancers. We also found high PF for multiple primaries. As for the three other cohort studies: In the Polish military sector, the PF of HL cancers was 36% in the exposed population as compared to 12% in the unexposed population, p<0.001. In a small group of employees exposed to RFR in Israeli defense industry, the PF of HL cancers was 60% versus 17% expected for the group age and gender profile, p<0.05. In Belgian radar battalions the HL PF was 8.3% versus 1.4% in the control battalions as shown in a causes of deaths study and HL cancer mortality rate ratio was 7.2 and statistically significant. Similar findings were reported on radio amateurs and Korean war technicians. Elevated risk ratios were previously reported in most of the above studies.CONCLUSIONS: The consistent association of RFR and highly elevated HL cancer risk in the four groups spread over three countries, operating different RFR equipment types and analyzed by different research protocols, suggests a cause-effect relationship between RFR and HL cancers in military/occupational settings. While complete measurements of RFR exposures were not available and rough exposure assessments from patients interviews and from partial exposure data were used instead, we have demonstrated increased HL cancers in occupational groups with relatively high RFR exposures. Our findings, combined with other studies, indicate that exposures incurred in the military settings evaluated here significantly increased the risk of HL cancers. Accordingly, the RFR military exposures in these occupations should be substantially reduced and further efforts should be undertaken to monitor and measure those exposures and to follow cohorts exposed to RFR for cancers and other health effects. Overall, the epidemiological studies on excess risk for HL and other cancers together with brain tumors in cellphone users and experimental studies on RFR and carcinogenicity make a coherent case for a cause-effect relationship and classifying RFR exposure as a human carcinogen (IARC group 1).",Excluded

2574,"Iatrogenic radiation exposure from neuroimaging may increase the risk of cancer and mortality in patients with epilepsy Objective:To calculate the dosage of radiation exposure of a series of patients with epilepsy and determine if this affects their estimated risk of developing cancer. Background(s): Patients with epilepsy frequently receive head imaging. Data from other populations demonstrates that radiation exposure such as that received in imaging studies may increase the risk of certain cancers and overall mortality. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed radiation exposure from imaging studies for the prior 5 years for 50 consecutive adult patients seen in a tertiary epilepsy. The original studies where reviewed to directly calculate the radiation exposure for each exam. Brain dose and bone marrow dose from SPECT, CT, FDG-PET was calculated based on published models. Result(s): The mean brain dose was 9.1 mGy and the mean bone marrow dose was 2.3 mGy. According to Pearce's mode this amount of radiation exposure doubles the risk of developing brain cancer or leukemia and by the BEIR Committee's formula, increase the risk of death from cancer by approximately 28 in 1,000,000 over the baseline risk of 2,000/1,000,000. Among the 50 patients, 17 of them had scans of either SPECT and/or CT and/or PET. These 17 patients had an average if 26.7 mGy of brain exposure and 6.8. mGy of bone marrow exposure. The highest brain exposure was 80 mGy, while the highest bone marrow exposure was 30.4 mGy. By Pearce's mode, these individuals may have up to a 3 fold increase in the risk of later developing brain tumors or leukemia. Conclusion(s): Patients with epilepsy may be at increased risk of developing fatal cancers from radiation exposure from common imaging procedures. Neurologists caring for patients with epilepsy should be judicious in ordering studies that expose patients to radiation.

3088,"Prostate cancer: Focal tumour ablation or total gland ablation? Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers affecting the male population worldwide. Men with newly diagnosed cancer have to decide between many available treatments. In particular, patients with low-risk PC (stage T1-T2, Nx-N0, M0) can now approach a focal therapy to avoid side effects of ""whole-gland treatment,"" such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or damage to surrounding structures. The key points for focal therapy depend on valid identification of target lesions within the prostate gland, long-term efficacy of treatment, and appropriate patient follow-up. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is now available as a focal therapeutic option for the management of low-risk PC; in the last 10 years, its feasibility and safety has been tested in a growing number of clinical studies. At present, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most accurate techniques used to investigate the male pelvis; recently, MR guidance was combined with the HIFU principle and was presented as a novel technique for focal ablation of PC. MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) represents a potential treatment of choice owing to its high anatomical resolution and the possibility of real-time monitoring of temperature during ablation. MRgFUS can also be used as a salvation therapy for locally proven recurrence of PC after radiation or brachytherapy failures.

Straylight values were measured before surgery and 3 months after surgery using the Oculus C-Quant (Oculus Optikgerate). Furthermore, correlations were analyzed between straylight and the following parameters: keratometry, axial length, spherical equivalent, astigmatism, pIOL power, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, and pupil size.RESULTS: Mean straylight decreased from 1.18 +/- 0.17 log units before surgery to 1.13 +/- 0.17 after surgery (P = .016). Higher preoperative straylight values were associated with larger postoperative decreases in straylight (r = -0.534; P < .001). Higher postoperative straylight values were correlated to higher axial length (r = 0.444; P = .001) and lower keratometry values in diopters (r = -0.414; P = .001). After regression analysis, only axial length was found to be an independent predictor of preoperative and postoperative straylight (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). After correcting for the axial length of an emmetropic eye (23.44 mm), all straylight correlations disappeared, indicating that an increase in distance from cornea to retina explains the increase in straylight values in longer eyes.CONCLUSIONS: Retinal straylight was reduced significantly after Artiflex pIOL implantation.

2550,"Molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity in malignant glioma Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by rapidly proliferating and invasive cells that infiltrate normal brain regions. Following exposure to aggressive treatment regimens, GBMs frequently shift their biological features upon recurrence, acquiring a more resistant phenotype. However, the dynamics and molecular mechanisms that facilitate GBM recurrence are still poorly understood. The objective our study was to determine how glioma stem cells (GSCs) temporally adjust their expression profile and phenotype in response to ionizing radiation or Temozolomide (TMZ) in vivo using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of GBM. We established two PDX GBM models by intracranially implanting two patient-derived GSC lines belonging to different GBM molecular subgroups (proneural and classical) into immunocompromised mice. The tumor-bearing mice were treated with single or multiple doses of ionizing radiation or TMZ to assess acute and long-term responses to treatment respectively. Mice from each cohort were be sacrificed at multiple distinct time points following treatment. Using immunohistochemical methods, we assessed changes in the expression of GBM subclass markers, stemness and differentiation markers, and DNA damage/repair proteins across the entire tumor population over time. Furthermore, to understand how the PDX tumors respond to radiation at a molecular level, we employed mass cytometry (CyTOF) and ChIP-seq to determine how important cellular signaling pathways and transcriptional programs necessary for GSC selfrenewal, invasion and growth are altered at various time points post-treatment. We demonstrate that GSCs undergo an immediate response following exposure to radiation that results in a global modulation of the expression of key stemness and proliferation genes under adverse conditions.

The external horizontal cells contact cone receptors and are stellate in shape; the intermediate horizontal cells are even more so and contact rod receptors. The internal horizontal cells constitute the most proximal layer of the inner nuclear layer and may possibly be, in reality, extended processes from the other two horizontal cell types. Bipolar cells resemble those in other teleost retinas: the size and shape of their dendritic tree encompass a continuous spectrum ranging from what is known as the small to the large bipolar cells. The accepted definition of amacrine cells is sufficiently vague to justify our originating a more descriptive and less inferential name for the (axonless) neurons in the inner nuclear layer which radiate processes throughout the inner synaptic layer. These starbust and spaghetti cells vary considerably in the character and extent of their dendritic spread, but correlates exist in other vertebrate retinas. Ganglion cells are found not only in the classical ganglion layer but displaced into the inner nuclear layer as well. Several types can be distinguished on the basis of cell geometry and by the properties of their dendritic tree. Not all of the categorization corresponds with previous descriptions; our findings suggest that some reorganization may be necessary in the accepted classification of cells in the proximal areas of the vertebrate retina. A subtle yet remarkable pattern underlies the entire structure of the catfish retina; there exists a definite gradient of size within a particular class of cells, and of configuration among the subclasses of a specific cell type. It remains to be seen if these morphological spectra bear any functional consequences. The fact that the structure of the catfish retina most closely resembles those of other phylogenetically ancient animals, such as the skate and the dogfish shark, testifies to its primitive organization; morphological and functional mechanisms discernible in this simple system may, therefore, be applicable to the retinas of higher ordered vertebrates.",Excluded
2962,"Devastating complications after brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate adenocarcinoma OBJECTIVE: To report a retrospective chart review of patients who developed recto-urethral fistula (RUF) or several bladder neck contracture (BNC) recurrences after brachytherapy for treating localized prostate cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the past 3 years 18 patients with devastating complications after prostate brachytherapy were referred to our centre (RUF in 11, BNC in seven; mean age 63 years, range 60-81). All patients with RUF initially underwent diverting colostomy (six cystoprostatectomy with closure of the fistula, omental interposition and urinary diversion; one prostatectomy, bladder neck closure, fistula closure with omentum flap and continent vesicostomy). Three patients had the fistula closed with gracilis muscle flap using the York-Mason approach (one had a bladder neck closure and suprapubic tube; one elected to have no treatment). All patients with BNC had received three or more procedures to resect or incise their contracture. Four had diversion with a catheterizable segment, two used an indwelling Foley catheter and one uses intermittent catheterization.RESULTS: All six patients who had cystoprostatectomy with urinary diversion have had no recurrence of their RUF. All three treated with the York-Mason procedure healed well. One developed recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma and two a secondary neoplasia in the prostate or rectum (leiomyosarcoma and neuroendocrine, respectively). The enterocystoplasty patient developed sepsis after colostomy reversal and subsequently died. In those patients with BNC, the four who underwent urinary diversion fared well; two tolerate the indwelling catheter poorly, and the seventh uses intermittent catheterization with occasional difficulty.CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy with or without external irradiation can be associated with severe complications. RUF managed with aggressive anterior pelvic exenteration and urinary diversion can be associated with excellent results. The York-Mason procedure in patients with an adequate urinary continence mechanism and bladder dynamics may provide good functional results. The presence of a secondary malignancy in patients deserves further investigation. Many recurrences of a BNC tend be refractory to transurethral resection/incision; indwelling catheters are then poorly tolerated and patients may require a major reconstructive procedure.",Excluded
3375,"Reducing Risk During Endoscopy in Patients with Implanted Electronic Devices The implantation of electronic devices to monitor and alter cardiac or neurologic function or to deliver pharmaceuticals is becoming commonplace. Gastrointestinal endoscopists should be attentive to the presence of implanted electronic devices and aware of the basic means for limiting risk during the use of electrocautery in patients who have such devices in place. The risk is relatively limited in most patients, and precautions for reducing risk are easily employed. Generic and specific recommendations are discussed pertinent to use of electrocautery in patients with cardiac and neurologic devices. Selected pacemaker-dependent patients with implanted intracardiac defibrillators and those with implanted deep brain stimulators or gastric pacing devices warrant specific specialty comment before endoscopy.

3406,"Small Cell Lung Cancer: Therapies and Targets Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a fatal disease due to limited therapeutic options. Systemic chemotherapy is the bedrock of treatment for both the limited and extensive stages of the disease. However, the established management paradigm of platinum-based chemotherapy has reached an efficacy plateau. A modest survival improvement, approximately 5%, was witnessed with the addition of cranial or thoracic radiation to systemic chemotherapy. Other strategies to improve outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in the last two decades have met with minimal success. The substitution of irinotecan for etoposide in the frontline treatment of SCLC achieved significant efficacy benefit in Japanese patients, but similar benefit could not be reproduced in other patient populations. Salvage treatment for recurrent or progressive SCLC is particularly challenging, where topotecan remains the only agent with regulatory approval to date. Ongoing evaluation of biologic agents targeting angiogenesis, sonic hedgehog pathway, DNA repair pathway, and immune checkpoint modulators hold some promise for improved outcome in SCLC. It is hoped that the coming decade will witness the application of new molecular biology and genomic research techniques to improve our understanding of SCLC biology and identification of molecular subsets that can be targeted appropriately using established and emerging biological agents similar to the accomplishments of the last decade with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3374,"MRI-Guided Ultrafocal HDR Brachytherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Median 4-Year Results of a feasibility study PURPOSE: For the treatment of localized prostate cancer, focal therapy has the potential to cure with fewer side effects than traditional whole-gland treatments. We report an update on toxicity, quality of life (QoL), and tumor control in our magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided ultrafocal high-dose-rate brachytherapy cohort.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Disease status was evaluated by systematic biopsies and 3T multiparametric MRI. The brachytherapy implant procedure under fused transrectal ultrasound/MRI guidance was followed by a 1.5 T MRI for contour adjustments and catheter position verification. A single dose of 19 Gy was delivered to the tumor with a margin of 5 mm. Genitourinary (GU) toxicity, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, and erectile dysfunction (ED) were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. QoL was measured with RAND-36, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and PR25. International Prostate Symptom Scores and International Index of Erectile Function scores were obtained. Prostate-specific antigen level was monitored, with biochemical recurrence defined as nadir + 2 ng/mL (Phoenix).RESULTS: Thirty patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network low- (13%) to intermediate-risk (87%) prostate cancer were treated between May 2013 and April 2016. Median follow-up was 4 years. Median age was 71 years (interquartile range, 68-73) and median initial prostate-specific antigen level was 7.3 ng/mL (5.2-8.1). Maximum Gleason score was 4 + 3 = 7 (in 2 patients). All tumors were radiologic (MRI) stage T2. No grade >2 GU or >1 GI toxicity occurred. International Prostate Symptom Scores only deteriorated temporarily. Mild pretreatment ED deteriorated to moderate/severe ED in 50% of patients. Long-term clinically relevant QoL deterioration was seen in sexual activity and tiredness, whereas emotional and cognitive functioning improved. At 4 years, biochemical disease-free survival was 70% (95% confidence interval, 52%-93%), metastases-free survival was 93% (85%-100%), and overall survival was 100%. Of intraprostatic recurrences, 7 of 9 were out of field.CONCLUSIONS: Ultrafocal high-dose-rate brachytherapy conveys minimal GU or GI toxicity and has a marginal effect on QoL. An early decline in erectile function was seen. Tumor control outcomes are poor (biochemical disease-free survival of 70% [52%-93%] at 4 years), most likely as a result of poor patient selection.",Excluded

2424,"Radiation therapy for the palliation of multiple myeloma Purpose: This study reviews the experience at the University of Arizona in an effort to define the minimum effective radiation dose for durable pain relief in the majority of patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma. Methods and Materials: The records of 101 patients with multiple myeloma irradiated for palliation at the University of Arizona between 1975 and 1990 were reviewed. Three hundred sixteen sites were treated. Ten sites were asymptomatic, including six hemibody fields with advanced disease unresponsive to chemotherapy and four local fields with impending pathological fractures. Three hundred six evaluable symptomatic sites remained. The most common symptom was bone pain. Other symptoms included neurological impairment and a palpable mass. Result(s): Total tumor dose ranged from 3.0 to 60 Gy, with a mean of 25 Gy. Symptom relief was obtained in 297 of 306 evaluable symptomatic sites (97%). Complete relief of symptoms was obtained in 26% and partial relief in 71%. Symptom relief was obtained in 92% of sites receiving a total dose less than 10 Gy (n = 13) and 98% of sites receiving 10 Gy or more (n = 293). No dose-response could be demonstrated. The likelihood of symptom relief was not influenced by the location of the lesion or the use of concurrent chemotherapy. Of the 297 responding sites, 6% (n = 19) relapsed after a median symptom-free interval of 16 months. Neither the probability of relapse nor the time to relapse was related to the radiation dose. Retreatment of relapsing sites provided effective palliation in all cases. Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy is effective in palliating local symptoms in multiple myeloma. A total dose of 10 Gy should provide durable symptom relief in the majority of patients.",Excluded

[French] Purpose of the study: In order to investigate the role of radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy in the management of vestibular schwannomas, we have reviewed our own prospective cohort and the main series of the modern literature. Patients and Methods: Between July 14th 1992 and June 1st 2011, 2991 vestibular schwannomas were operated on the Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery Department of Timone University Hospital. All the patients have been evaluated prospectively, with a follow up longer than 3 years for 2336 patients, excluding patients suffering from type 2 neurofibromatosis (148 patients). In 7% of the patients, the vestibular schwannoma had previously been resected. According to Koos classification, in 17.6% of the patients, vestibular schwannomas were stage I, 51.8% stage II, 27% stage III and 3.6% stage IV. The mean tumour volume was 2.63 cm<sup>3</sup>. According to Garner Robertson classification, the hearing was still functional at the time of radiosurgery in 46% and subnormal in 20.9% of the patients. Result(s): Long term tumour control was achieved in 97.5% of the patients. A transient facial palsy was observed in 0.5% of the cases. The rate of trigeminal injury was 0.5%. Useful hearing was preserved at 3 years in 78%. This rate reached 95% in patients with no past history of sudden hearing loss. Other predictors of functional hearing preservation are the young age, the small size of the lesion and a dose to the modiulus of the cochlea lower than 4. Gy. We observed no radio-induced tumour. Only large, Koos IV vestibular schwannomas are contraindicated for upfront radiosurgery. In these patients, we propose a combined approach with a deliberately partial microsurgical removal, followed by a radiosurgery of the residue. Conclusion(s): This cohort is unique by the size of the population and the length of the follow up and results demonstrate the efficacy of radiosurgery and its safety, especially its high rate of hearing preservation. © 2012 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).",Excluded
3598,"Modification of radiation myelopathy by the transplantation of neural stem cells in the rat In a novel approach, neural stem cells were transplanted to ameliorate radiation-induced myelopathy in the spinal cords of rats. A 12-mm section of the cervical spinal cord (T2-C2) of 5-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats was locally irradiated with a single dose of 22 Gy of (60)Co gamma rays. This dose is known to produce myelopathy in all animals within 6 months of irradiation. After irradiation, the animals were subdivided into three groups, and at 90 days after irradiation, neural stem cells or saline (for controls) were injected into the spinal cord, intramedullary, at two sites positioned 6 mm apart on either side of the center of the irradiated length of spinal cord. The injection volume was 2 microl. Group I received a suspension of MHP36 cells, Group II MHP15 cells, and Group III (controls) two injections of 2 microl saline. All rats received 10 mg/kg cyclosporin (10 mg/ml) daily i.p. to produce immunosuppression. All animals that received saline (Group III) developed paralysis within 167 days of irradiation. The paralysis-free survival rates of rats that received transplanted MHP36 and MHP15 cells (Groups I and II) were 36.4% and 32% at 183 days, respectively.

3373,"First in Human Clinical Trial of a Metalloporphyrin Dual Radioprotectant and Radiosensitizer, BMX-001, in Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Glioma Undergoing Concurrent Chemoradiation Purpose/Objective(s): The metalloporphyrin, BMX-001 (MnTnBuOE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>), uniquely protects normal tissues from radiation damage and sensitizes tumor cells to radiation damage. We demonstrated this dual action in preclinical models where it protected white matter from radiation damage but augmented radiation-induced cell kill in human glioblastoma (GBM) xenografts. Therefore, we performed a phase 1 study to evaluate safety of BMX-001 in newly diagnosed patients with HGG receiving concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). Materials/Methods: This clinical trial was an IRB-approved, phase 1, single-center, dose-escalation study of BMX-001 in combination with concurrent RT (daily fractions of 1.8-2 Gy to a total of 59.4-60 Gy) and TMZ (75 mg/m2 daily X 42 days). We delivered BMX-001 via subcutaneous injection at a loading dose before the start of RT/TMZ and then 2 times/week for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and neurocognition. We defined progression-free survival and overall survival as survival from time of first BMX-001 injection until progression and death, respectively, and calculated both based on Kaplan-Meier analyses. Result(s): There were 15 evaluable subjects in the phase 1 study that received all planned BMX-001 doses. All 15 subjects had GBM (WHO grade IV) with age range of 19 to 80 years. BMX-001 at 28 mg loading dose and 14 mg subsequent dose was the MTD. Sinus tachycardia (grade 3) was the dose-limiting toxicity at 42 mg loading dose (n=1). The only other related grade >= 3 event was hypotension (grade 3, n=1). The most common related toxicity was grade 1 injection site reaction (n=7). Median follow-up time was 20.5 months (95% CI: 8.9, -). Progression-free survival was 7.1 months (95% CI: 3.9, 11.4). Overall survival was 23.4 months (95% CI: 11.2, 25.9) with seven GBM patients still alive at the time of this analysis. At time of this analysis, long-term results of neurocognition are pending. Conclusion(s): BMX-001 was safe to administer during concurrent chemoradiation in newly diagnosed HGG. Early results of survival analyses are promising, and long-term neurocognitive protection remains to be determined. Thus, we launched a multi-institutional Phase 2 study with BMX-001 in combination with concurrent chemoradiation in newly diagnosed HGG with key endpoints including overall survival and neurocognition and exploratory endpoints examining white matter integrity and health-related quality of life. Clinical trials are underway also for utilization of BMX-001 with radiation therapy for patients with head and neck cancer and brain metastases. Copyright © 2019",Excluded
3046,"Effects of external beam radiation in the rat tibial nerve after crush, transection and repair, or nerve isograft paradigms INTRODUCTION: In head and neck surgery, radiation therapy is often administered to an injured nerve. Previous studies have examined the effects of either preoperative or postoperative radiation on nerve regeneration in rodents. In these studies, histomorphometric analysis was performed up to 8 month postoperatively. Given the exceptional neuroregenerative capacity of rodents, significant differences in nerve regeneration may go undetected if nerves are evaluated at such distant postoperative time points. This study is designed with a more appropriate model and investigates the effects of radiation after three common nerve injury paradigms.METHODS: Sixty-four Lewis rates were randomized to 8 groups corresponding to uninjured, tibial nerve crush, transection and repair, or reconstruction with isografts. Half of the animals in each of these paradigms (n = 8 per group) were treated with 10 Gy of external beam radiation to the site of nerve injury at 7 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 28, functional recovery and histomorphometric assessment was performed.RESULTS: For a given paradigm of nerve injury, no significant differences in nerve fiber number, neural density, neural debris, or fiber width were noted between the control and radiated groups, and radiation did not affect functional recovery.CONCLUSION: Radiation had no discernible effect on nerve regeneration or functional recovery in the rodent nerve injury models studied. All assessments were made at time points suitable for detecting differences in nerve regeneration between groups. These findings suggest that administration of radiation to fields containing injured peripheral nerve is unlikely to adversely affect functional outcomes.",Included

The number of Abeta plaques, along with expression of AD specific genes (84 genes: Mouse Alzheimer's Disease RT(2) Profiler), radiation-associated cytokines (Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine Chemokine Immunoassay) and immunohistochemistry (IL10, IL-1beta, Iba1 CD45) was assessed. Behavioral testing was performed to relate changes in Abeta burden to cognitive function using a Morris water-maze task.RESULTS: Single X-ray doses reduced the number (p=0.002) and size (p=0.01) of Abeta plaques. Low-dose fractionation produced greater 50.6% (1 Gy x 10), 72% (2 Gy x 5) and 78% (2 Gy x 10) reductions. Irradiation was associated with gene (Pkp4, 1.5-fold, p=0.004) and proteomic (MIP-2, 8-fold, p=0.0024) changes at 24-48 h. Microglia increased at 4 weeks post-irradiation (p=0.001). The reduction in Abeta burden (2 Gy x 5) was associated with cognitive improvement (p=0.012).CONCLUSION: This is the first report that a clinically relevant course of external beam irradiation (2 Gy x 5) produces a significant reduction in AD-associated amyloid-beta plaques with a subsequent improvement in cognitive function.

3314,"Survival and danger signals expression in glioblastoma cell lines: Tumour immunogenicity after radiation and chemotherapy Tumour immunogenicity is the ability of a tumour to induce an immune response that can prevent its growth. The tumour cell microenvironment, the stroma and immunity have a major role in cancer. When cells die as a result of chemoradiotherapy, the innate immune system not only alerts the adaptive immune system to potential danger, but also induces an inflammatory response. Defined proteins that appear at the surface of stressed and dying cells and are released from the cells can stimulate this immune response. The molecular mechanism accounting for the expression of immunogenic signals, in particular, in glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumour, is presently under investigation. In this tumour it is necessary not only to develop a strategy to kill cancer cells efficiently, but also to attempt to stimulate an immune response to keep residual tumour under control. In our studies we investigated cell death and survival after single treatments or combination of X rays and temozolomide in glioblastoma cell lines (T98G, U87 and U251MG) and we attempted to identify danger signals, HMGB1 and HSP70, that are released by dying cells and could activate anti-tumour immunity that might contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of treatments. Our results confirmed recent data showing a resistance to ionizing radiation of these cell lines. Under our experimental conditions, after a dose of 2 Gy and 10 Gy we observed a drastic increase of cell death. Our data suggested that HSP70 and HMGB1 were expressed and released in response to single or combined treatments of radiation and temozolomide, confirming a role of these proteins as signals released after radiation-induced damage in glioblastoma cells. We also could state that temozolomide had limited effectiveness in activating HMGB1 and HSP70 signalling and, instead, an adjuvant effect in their expression and release was observed in some combined treatments, but this depended on schedule, cell line and timing.",Excluded
3509,"MRI changes in the rat hippocampus following proton radiosurgery PURPOSE: To define radiographic dose-response relationships for proton radiosurgery using a rat brain model.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A group of 23 rats was treated with Bragg peak proton beam irradiation involving the right hippocampus. Single doses of 5, 12, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 130 cobalt gray equivalents (CGE) were delivered to groups of 3 animals using single fraction technique. One extra animal was included at the 130- and 30-CGE doses. Animals were imaged using a standard 1.5-tesla GE Signa MRI. A 3-inch surface coil was employed to obtain T1-weighted sagittal images (TR 600 and TE 30) and dual echo T2-weighted coronal images (TR 3,000 and TE 30/90). Animals were imaged at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6 and 9 months. Volumetric analysis with custom software was done to evaluate areas of increased signal on T2-weighted images, and signal change versus time curves were generated. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was also done at the 9-month time point to further evaluate tissue injury. The development of hydrocephalus was also examined.RESULTS: Peak tissue injury was greater and occurred earlier with higher versus lower doses of radiation. Statistically significant differences were seen between the 130- and 90-CGE animals and between the 90- and 60-CGE animals (p < 0.0016) using ANOVA. Signal changes can be seen in at least 1 of the animals at 20 CGE. The largest volume of tissue enhancement at 9 months was seen in animals at 60 CGE, which may represent an intermediate zone of tissue injury and gliosis compared with greater tissue loss at higher doses and less injury at lower doses. Hydrocephalus developed first in the untreated hemisphere in 130- and 90-CGE animals as a result of mass effect while it occurred at a later time in the treated hemisphere in lower-dose animals.CONCLUSIONS: Following single-dose proton radiosurgery of rat hippocampus, serial MRIs show T2 signal changes in animals ranging from 130 down to 20 CGE as well as the development of hydrocephalus. Dose-effect relationships using proton radiosurgery in rats will be a helpful step in guiding further studies on radiation injury to brain tissue.",Included
3589,"Cellular response of meningioma towards retinoid acid and ionizing radiation Meningiomas are the second most common primary brain tumors and represent one-third of all primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. Currently, most meninigiomas are effectively managed via surgical resection. Recurrent meningiomas and unresectable, residual tumors after partial resection are treated with radiation. However, patients who are not suitable for surgery or radiation therapy or whose tumors recur after such treatment have limited therapeutic options. Retinoids are a class of compounds structurally related to vitamin A. Retinoic acid (RA) has been widely used to treat dermatological disease. Recently, RA, the active derivative of vitamin A and the first candidate diffusible morphogen in vertebrates, was used as a potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agent. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of RA on meningiomas when administered in combinination with ionizing radiation. The early data showed that both all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 13-cis-retinoic aciecan inhibited cell proliferation at high concentrations (10 mM) but had little cell proliferation inhibition activity at low concentrations (10 nM and 1 mM, respectively), thereby implicating the role of RA in meningioma clinical treatment. Neither ATRA nor 13-cis-RA influenced cell cycle progression. Further study showed that 10-mM ATRA exposure led to increased cell death after irradiation; however, 10-nM or 1-mMATRA pretreatment enhanced meningioma cell survival following irradiation. Comet assay showed that RA reduced the G2/M phase arrest caused by irradiation, thereby suggesting that DNA repair processes are involved in the activity of RA when combined with radiation.",Excluded

Images of H&N anthropomorphic phantom were acquired with a computed tomography scanner and exported via digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) standards to a treatment planning system. Treatment plans were performed using a VMAT dual-arc technique, a nine-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique, and a four-field three-dimensional conformal therapy (3DCRT) technique. The prescription dose was 66.0 Gy for all three techniques, but to accommodate the range of dosimeter responses, we delivered a single dose of 6.60 Gy to the isocenter. The lifetime risk for secondary cancers was estimated according to National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report 116. VMAT delivered the lowest maximum doses to esophagus (23 Gy), and normal brain (40 Gy). In comparison, maximum doses for 3DCRT were 74% and 40%, higher than those for VMAT for the esophagus, and normal brain, respectively. The normal tissue complication probability and equivalent uniform dose for the brain (2.1%, 0.9%, 0.8% and 3.8 Gy, 2.6 Gy, 2.3 Gy) and esophagus (4.2%, 0.7%, 0.4% and 3.7 Gy, 2.2 Gy, 1.8 Gy) were calculated for the 3DCRT, IMRT and VMAT respectively. Fractional esophagus OAR volumes receiving more than 20 Gy were 3.6% for VMAT, 23.6% for IMRT, and 100% for 3DCRT.

2741,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone-mediated pathway of leptin to regulate feeding, adiposity, and uncoupling protein expression in mice To examine the functional role of CRH in the regulation of energy homeostasis by leptin, we measured the effects of the CRH antagonist, alpha-helical CRH 8-41 (alphaCRH) on a number of factors affected by leptin activity. These included food intake, body weight, hypothalamic c-fos-like immunoreactivity (c-FLI), weight and histological characterization of white adipose tissue, and mRNA expressions of uncoupling protein (UCP) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in C57Bl/6 mice. Central infusion of leptin into the lateral cerebroventricle (icv) caused significant induction of c-FLI in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, and arcuate nucleus. In all these nuclei, the effect of leptin on expression of cFLI in the PVN and VMH was decreased by treatment with alphaCRH. Administration of leptin markedly decreased cumulative food intake and body weight with this effect being attenuated by pretreatment with alphaCRH. In peripheral tissue, leptin up-regulated BAT UCP1 mRNA expression and reduced fat depositions in this tissue. Those changes in BAT were also decreased by treatment with alphaCRH. As a consequence of the effects on food intake or energy expenditure, treatment with alphaCRH attenuated the leptin-induced reduction of body adiposity, fat cell size, triglyceride contents, and ob mRNA expression in white adipose tissue. Taken together, these results indicate that CRH neurons in the PVN and VMH may be an important mediator for leptin that contribute to regulation of feeding, adiposity, and UCP expression.",Excluded
3094,"Repeated cocaine administration increases voltage-sensitive calcium currents in response to membrane depolarization in medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a critical role in cocaine addiction. However, evidence to elucidate how the mPFC is functionally involved in cocaine addiction remains incomplete. Recent studies have revealed that repeated cocaine administration induces various neuroadaptations in pyramidal mPFC neurons, including a reduction in voltage-gated K+ currents (VGKCs) and a possible increase in voltage-sensitive Ca2+ currents (I(Ca)). Here, we performed both current-clamp recordings in brain slices and voltage-clamp recordings in freshly dissociated cells to determine whether I(Ca) is altered in mPFC pyramidal neurons after chronic cocaine treatment with a short-term or long-term withdrawal. In addition, a critical role of VGKCs in regulating the generation of Ca2+ plateau potential was also studied in mPFC neurons. Repeated cocaine administration significantly prolonged the duration of evoked Ca2+ plateau potentials and increased the whole-cell I(Ca) in mPFC neurons after a 3 d withdrawal. Selective blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels by nifedipine not only significantly increased the threshold but also reduced the duration and amplitude of Ca2+ plateau potentials in both saline- and cocaine-withdrawn mPFC neurons. However, there was no significant difference in the increased threshold, reduced duration, and decreased amplitude of Ca2+ potentials between saline- and cocaine-withdrawn neurons after blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels. Moreover, an increase in amplitude was also observed, whereas the prolonged duration persisted, in Ca2+ potentials after 2-3 weeks of withdrawal. These findings indicate that chronic exposure to cocaine facilitates the responsiveness of I(Ca), particularly via the activated L-type Ca2+ channels, to excitatory stimuli in rat mPFC pyramidal neurons.",Excluded
2869,"Cochlear-implant high pulse rate and narrow electrode configuration impair transmission of temporal information to the auditory cortex In the most commonly used cochlear prosthesis systems, temporal features of sound are signaled by amplitude modulation of constant-rate pulse trains. Several convincing arguments predict that speech reception should be optimized by use of pulse rates > or approximately 2,000 pulses per second (pps) and by use of intracochlear electrode configurations that produce restricted current spread (e.g., bipolar rather than monopolar configurations). Neither of those predictions has been borne out in consistent improvements in speech reception. Neurons in the auditory cortex of anesthetized guinea pigs phase lock to the envelope of sine-modulated electric pulse trains presented through a cochlear implant. The present study used that animal model to quantify the effects of carrier pulse rate, electrode configuration, current level, and modulator wave shape on transmission of temporal information from a cochlear implant to the auditory cortex. Modulation sensitivity was computed using a signal-detection analysis of cortical phase-locking vector strengths. Increasing carrier pulse rate in 1-octave steps from 254 to 4,069 pps resulted in systematic decreases in sensitivity. Comparison of sine- versus square-wave modulator waveforms demonstrated that some, but not all, of the loss of modulation sensitivity at high pulse rates was a result of the decreasing size of pulse-to-pulse current steps at the higher rates. Use of a narrow bipolar electrode configuration, compared with the monopolar configuration, produced a marked decrease in modulation sensitivity. Results from this animal model suggest explanations for the failure of high pulse rates and/or bipolar electrode configurations to produce hoped-for improvements in speech reception.",Excluded

3280,"Comparing DNA damage induced by mobile telephony and other types of man-made electromagnetic fields The number of studies showing adverse effects on living organisms induced by different types of man-made Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) has increased tremendously. Hundreds of peer reviewed published studies show a variety of effects, the most important being DNA damage which is linked to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, reproductive declines etc. Those studies that are far more effective in showing effects employ real-life Mobile Telephony (MT) exposures emitted by commercially available mobile phones. The present review - of results published by my group from 2006 until 2016 - compares DNA fragmentation induced by six different EMFs on the same biological system - the oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster - under identical conditions and procedures. Such a direct comparison between different EMFs - especially those employed in daily life - on the same biological endpoint, is very useful for drawing conclusions on their bioactivity, and novel. It shows that real MT EMFs are far more damaging than 50 Hz alternating magnetic field (MF) - similar or much stronger to those of power lines - or a pulsed electric field (PEF) found before to increase fertility. The MT EMFs were significantly more bioactive even for much shorter exposure durations than the other EMFs. Moreover, they were more damaging than previously tested cytotoxic agents like certain chemicals, starvation, dehydration. Individual parameters of the real MT EMFs like intensity, frequency, exposure duration, polarization, pulsing, modulation, are discussed in terms of their role in bioactivity. The crucial parameter for the intense bioactivity seems to be the extreme variability of the polarized MT signals, mainly due to the large unpredictable intensity changes.

2459,"Statistical properties of cerebral CT perfusion imaging systems. Part I. Cerebral blood volume maps generated from nondeconvolution-based systems Purpose: The development and clinical employment of a computed tomography (CT) imaging system benefit from a thorough understanding of the statistical properties of the output images; cerebral CT perfusion (CTP) imaging system is no exception. A series of articles will present statistical properties of CTP systems and the dependence of these properties on system parameters. This Part I paper focuses on the signal and noise properties of cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps calculated using a nondeconvolution-based method. Method(s): The CBV imaging chain was decomposed into a cascade of subimaging stages, which facilitated the derivation of analytical models for the probability density function, mean value, and noise variance of CBV. These models directly take CTP source image acquisition, reconstruction, and postprocessing parameters as inputs. Both numerical simulations and in vivo canine experiments were performed to validate these models. Result(s): The noise variance of CBV is linearly related to the noise variance of source images and is strongly influenced by the noise variance of the baseline images. Uniformly partitioning the total radiation dose budget across all time frames was found to be suboptimal, and an optimal dose partition method was derived to minimize CBV noise. Results of the numerical simulation and animal studies validated the derived statistical properties of CBV. Conclusion(s): The statistical properties of CBV imaging systems can be accurately modeled by extending the linear CT systems theory. Based on the statistical model, several key signal and noise characteristics of CBV were identified and an optimal dose partition method was developed to improve the image quality of CBV.

2666,"Mechanisms of action for an anti-radiation vaccine in reducing the biological impact of high dose and dose-rate, low-linear energy transfer radiation exposure The development of an anti-radiation vaccine could be very useful in reducing acute radiation syndromes. Existing principles for the treatment of acute radiation syndromes are based on the amelioration of progressive pathophysiological changes, using the concept of replacement therapy. Active immunization by small quantities of the essential radiation-induced systemic toxins of what we call the Specific Radiation Determinant (SRD) before irradiation increased duration of life among animals that were irradiated by lethal or sub-lethal doses of gamma-radiation. The SRD toxins possess antigenic properties that are specific to different forms of acute radiation sickness. Intramuscular injection of larger quantities of the SRD toxins induce signs and symptoms in irradiated naive animals similar to those observed in acute radiation syndromes, including death. Providing passive immunization, at variable periods of time following radiation, with preparations of immune-globulins directed at the SRD molecules, can confer some protection in the development of clinical sequelae in irradiated animals. Improved survival rates and times were observed in animals that received lower, sublethal doses of the same SRDs prior to irradiation. Therefore, active immunization can be induced by SRD molecules as a prophylaxis. The protective effects of the immunization begin to manifest 15-35 days after an injection of a biologically active SDR preparation. The SRD molecules are a group of radiation toxins with antigenic properties that correlate specifically with different forms of radiation disease. The SRD molecules are composed of glycoproteins and lipoproteins that accumulate in the lymphatic system of mammals in the first hours after irradiation, and preliminary analysis suggests that they may originate from cellular membrane components. The molecular weight of the SRD group ranges from 200-250 kDa. The SRD molecules were isolated from the lymphatic systems of laboratory animals that were irradiated with doses known to induce the development of cerebral (SRD-1), non-specific toxic effects (SRD-2), gastrointestinal (SRD-3) and hematological (bone marrow) (SRD-4) syndromes. Our results suggest that an anti-radiation vaccine can be developed for prophylactic use against radiation damage induced by acute exposure to significant doses of low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation for humans, including nuclear power workers, commercial and military pilots, cosmonauts/astronauts, nuclear-powered engine vessel operators and possibly even the civilian population in the case of a nuclear terrorism event.",Excluded

Prescription dose was 45 Gy. Target volumes were: gross tumor volume (GTV) = macroadenoma, clinical target volume (CTV) = GTV, and planning target volume = CTV + 0.5 cm. Structure contouring was performed by two radiation oncologists guided by an expert neuroradiologist.RESULTS: Five-field IMRT yielded significantly decreased temporal lobe dose delivery compared with 3D-CRT and 3F IMRT. Temporal lobe sparing with 5F IMRT was most pronounced at intermediate doses: mean V25Gy (% of total temporal lobe volume receiving >=25 Gy) of 13% vs. 28% vs. 29% for right temporal lobe and 14% vs. 29% vs. 30% for left temporal lobe for 5F IMRT, 3D-CRT, and 3F IMRT, respectively (p < 10(-7) for 5F IMRT vs. 3D-CRT and 5F IMRT vs. 3F IMRT). Five-field IMRT plans did not compromise target coverage, exceed normal tissue dose constraints, or increase estimated brain integral dose.CONCLUSIONS: Five-field IMRT irradiation technique results in a statistically significant decrease in the dose to the temporal lobes and may thus help prevent neurocognitive sequelae in irradiated pituitary macroadenoma patients.",Excluded

2633,"Dose-painting intensity-modulated proton therapy for intermediate- and high-risk meningioma BACKGROUND: Newly diagnosed WHO grade II-III or any WHO grade recurrent meningioma exhibit an aggressive behavior and thus are considered as high- or intermediate risk tumors. Given the unsatisfactory rates of disease control and survival after primary or adjuvant radiation therapy, optimization of treatment strategies is needed. We investigated the potential of dose-painting intensity-modulated proton beam-therapy (IMPT) for intermediate- and high-risk meningioma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Imaging data from five patients undergoing proton beam-therapy were used. The dose-painting target was defined using [68]Ga-[1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid]- d-Phe(1),Tyr(3)-octreotate ([68]Ga-DOTATATE)-positron emission tomography (PET) in target delineation. IMPT and photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans were generated for each patient using an in-house developed treatment planning system (TPS) supporting spot-scanning technology and a commercial TPS, respectively. Doses of 66 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) and 54 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) were prescribed to the PET-based planning target volume (PTVPET) and the union of PET- and anatomical imaging-based PTV, respectively, in 30 fractions, using simultaneous integrated boost.RESULTS: Dose coverage of the PTVsPET was equally good or slightly better in IMPT plans: dose inhomogeneity was 10 +/- 3% in the IMPT plans vs. 13 +/- 1% in the IMRT plans (p = 0.33). The brain Dmean and brainstem D50 were small in the IMPT plans: 26.5 +/- 1.5 Gy(RBE) and 0.002 +/- 0.0 Gy(RBE), respectively, vs. 29.5 +/- 1.5 Gy (p = 0.001) and 7.5 +/- 11.1 Gy (p = 0.02) for the IMRT plans, respectively. The doses delivered to the optic structures were also decreased with IMPT.CONCLUSIONS: Dose-painting IMPT is technically feasible using currently available planning tools and resulted in dose conformity of the dose-painted target comparable to IMRT with a significant reduction of radiation dose delivered to the brain, brainstem and optic apparatus.

The actions of two distinct types of caged cGMP (NPE-caged cGMP and a highly water-soluble caged cGMP) were compared. Rapidly activating inward currents were evoked by cGMP in a subpopulation (12.5%) of neurones and these currents may be due to activity of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. In contrast in 52% of DRG neurones intracellular photorelease of cGMP activated a delayed Ca(2+)-dependent inward current through the generation of cyclic ADPribose and mobilisation of Ca(2+) from ryanodine sensitive intracellular stores. Similar delayed inward currents were activated by both caged compounds but only NPE-caged cGMP evoked rapidly activating currents. Cyclic GMP appears to increase excitability in some DRG neurones by diverse mechanisms.,Excluded

There is limited data to guide on optimal constraints to the adjacent nontarget brain. This investigation explored the significance of the three-dimensional (3D) dose distribution of passive scattering proton therapy to the brain with other clinicopathological factors on the development of symptomatic radiation necrosis. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients with head and neck, skull base, or intracranial tumors who underwent proton therapy (minimum prescription dose of 59.4 Gy(RBE)) with collateral moderate to high dose radiation exposure to the nontarget brain were retrospectively reviewed. A mixture cure model with respect to necrosis-free survival was used to derive estimates for the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model while adjusting for potential confounding factors. Result(s): Of 179 identified patients, 83 patients had intracranial tumors and 96 patients had primary extracranial tumors. The optimal dose measure obtained to describe the occurrence of radiation necrosis was the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) with parameter a = 9. The best-fit parameters of logistic NTCP models revealed D<inf>50</inf> = 57.7 Gy for intracranial tumors, D<inf>50</inf> = 39.5 Gy for extracranial tumors, and gamma<inf>50</inf> = 2.5 for both tumor locations.

Recently functional imaging studies provide evidence for direct participation of basal temporal and occipital cortices in the cognitive process of reading. The exact location and function of these areas remain a matter of debate.OBJECTIVE: To confirm the participation of the basal temporal region in reading.METHOD: Extraoperative electrical stimulation of the dominant hemisphere was performed in three subjects using subdural electrodes, as part of presurgical evaluation for refractory epilepsy.RESULTS: Pure alexia was reproduced during cortical stimulation of the dominant posterior fusiform and inferior temporal gyri in all three patients. Stimulation resulted in selective reading difficulty with intact auditory comprehension and writing. Reading difficulty involved sentences and words with intact letter by letter reading. Picture naming difficulties were also noted at some electrodes. This region is located posterior to and contiguous with the basal temporal language area (BTLA) where stimulation resulted in global language dysfunction in visual and auditory realms. The location corresponded with the visual word form area described on functional MRI.CONCLUSION: These observations support the existence of a visual language area in the dominant fusiform and occipitotemporal gyri, contiguous with basal temporal language area. A portion of visual language area was exclusively involved in lexical processing while the other part of this region processed both lexical and nonlexical symbols.",Excluded

'Central neurocytoma' is classically considered as an intraventricular benign tumor, largely based on data from small retrospective series. The authors present prospective data on 12 patients with tumors diagnosed as central neurocytoma, to highlight the diverse nature of this tumor and challenge the classic notion. METHODS. Between 1991 and 1997, 12 patients had tumors diagnosed prospectively as 'central neurocytoma'. Clinical, radiologic, and histologic data were collected, and Karnofsky performance score was evaluated for each patient. Proliferation marker studies were performed using Ki-67 labeling index. RESULTS. In two patients, the tumors were located in atypical locations, namely, the parietal lobe and the spine. Aggressive behavior characterized by clinical and radiologic evidence of tumor progression was noted in two additional patients. In both these cases, unusually high proliferation rates of 5.3% and 11.2% were noted. Total excision of the tumor, when possible, was the treatment of choice. Postoperative radiotherapy to the residual tumor may be of benefit in patients with clinically aggressive tumors, or those with high proliferation rates. CONCLUSIONS. Given the findings of this study; it is suggested that the traditional concept of central neurocytoma as a benign intraventricular tumor warrants reconsideration.

However, through lineage fate-mapping we demonstrate that such in vivo fusion of lymphoid and myeloid blood cells does not occur to an appreciable extent in steady-state adult tissues or during normal development. Rather, fusion of blood cells with different non-haematopoietic cell types is induced by organ-specific injuries or whole-body irradiation, which has been used in previous studies to condition recipients of bone marrow transplants.

We hypothesized that HU would elicit anhedonia, cardiac sympathovagal imbalance and increased arrhythmogenesis. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats confined to 10-14 days of HU, or casted control (CC) condition were surgically instrumented with indwelling vascular catheters, a radiotelemetry transmitter or an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) electrode. Anhedonia was measured through sucrose preference and the response to ICSS. Sequential autonomic blockade following administration of propranolol and atropine and time-domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were used to measure sympathovagal balance. Cardiac arrhythmias were produced and scored following sympathetic stimulation (SS) via isoproterenol administration and brief handling/restraint. HU resulted in reductions in both sucrose preference and ICSS. Propranolol administration elicited a significantly greater bradycardia in HU vs. CC rats, while the tachycardic response to methyl-atropine was nearly abolished in HU rats.

Here, we find that nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonism in mice as well as epithelial-specific ablation of M3R induces a selective expansion of DCLK1-positive tuft cells, suggesting a model of feedback inhibition. Cholinergic blockade reduces Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cell tracing and cell number. In contrast, Prox1-positive endocrine cells appear as primary sensors of cholinergic blockade inducing the expansion of tuft cells, which adopt an enteroendocrine phenotype and contribute to increased mucosal levels of acetylcholine. This compensatory mechanism is lost with acute irradiation injury, resulting in a paucity of tuft cells and acetylcholine production. Thus, enteroendocrine tuft cells appear essential to maintain epithelial homeostasis following modifications of the cholinergic intestinal niche. Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

Molecular subtypes were defined as luminal A (LA), luminal B (LB)-HER2(-), LB-HER2(+), HER2, and triple-negative (TN) based on the 2013 St. Gallen Consensus criteria. Competing risks analysis and baseline hazard rate function plots were used to explore subtype-specific recurrence patterns.RESULTS: The 10-year overall survival rates of LA, LB-HER2(-), LB-HER2(+), HER2, and TN groups were 96, 93, 94, 84, and 85%, respectively (P < 0.001). Distant metastatic events differed significantly according to molecular subtype (P < 0.001). In competing risks regression analysis, initial development of distant metastasis was the highest with TN tumors, followed by HER2, LB-HER2(-), and LB-HER2(+) subtypes (P = 0.005). Regarding preferential sites of distant metastasis, the risk of initial brain metastasis was significantly higher with HER2 tumors, followed by TN tumors (P = 0.001). A low-level but sustained metastatic risk increment was observed in luminal tumors, whereas TN and HER2 subtypes showed a short-term risk surge within 5 years.CONCLUSION: From the significant impact of molecular profile on distant metastasis, subtype-specific individualization of systemic treatment and close surveillance are suggested. The preferential and long-term risk of brain metastasis in the HER2 subtype underlines the importance of alternative anti-HER2 therapies.",Excluded
2768,Delayed cerebral radionecrosis following treatment of carcinoma of the scalp: clinicopathologic and ultrastructural study A 56-year-old female was found to have cerebral radionecrosis four and one-half years following betatron therapy of a carcinoma of the scalp. Angiographic findings revealed irregular narrowing of the pericallosal artery in the site of the lesion. The patient has resumed full activities with no new neurological findings in the six years following radical extirpation of the lesion. Fourteen similar cases are reviewed. Ten of the twelve patients who underwent radical surgery were cured. Radical extirpation soon after making the diagnosis of cerebral radionecrosis appears to be the treatment of choice. Characteristic ultrastructural findings of abnormal vessels are discussed.,Excluded
2609,"The effects of PDT in primary malignant brain tumours could be improved by intraoperative radiotherapy INTRODUCTION: GBM has a poor survival despite surgery and chemoradiotherapy. Cytoreduction and PDT have postulated to afford better local GBM-control. However, the interaction of PDT with newer novel therapies had not been fully investigated. This study reviewed the impact of PDT in conjunction with intraoperative radiotherapy.METHODS: Case note review of prospectively collected data of GBMs treated surgically by the senior author (SE). Patients received standard therapy (ST), ST+PDT or ST+PDT+IORT. ST involved maximum safe resection, PDT involved intracavity 100 J/cm2 630 nm laser and IORT involved intracavity 10-15 Gys using the PRS400 R. Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically till death.RESULTS: There were 73 patients included in this analysis (42 males). The average age was 59years. Thirty received PDT and 43 did not. The mean survival of PDT-patients was significantly longer than those had ST alone (62.9 weeks vs. 20.6 weeks) (p=0.001). Patients < 65 year of age survived longer than those >= 65 year (p=0.033). IORT on its own did not make a significant difference to survival (p=0.111). However the average survival for patients who received PDT+IORT was substantially higher than those who received PDT alone (79 weeks vs. 39.7 weeks). Using a Cox regression covariant analysis, demonstrated that PDT was the only therapy to make a statistically significant difference to survival (p=0.018).CONCLUSIONS: PDT in high grade glioma was statistically significant therapeutic modality and its effects were further improved by IORT.",Excluded
2445,"Mechanical stress models of Alzheimer's disease pathology Introduction Extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta protein and intracellular accumulation of tau in brain tissues have been described in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mechanical stress-based diseases of different mechanisms, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), arterial hypertension (HTN), and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Methods We provide a brief overview of experimental models of TBI, HTN, and NPH showing features of tau-amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. Results ""Alzheimer-like"" hallmarks found in these mechanical stress-based models were compared with AD features found in transgenic models. Discussion The goal of this review is, therefore, to build on current concepts of onset and progression of AD lesions. We point to the importance of accumulated mechanical stress in brain as an environmental and endogenous factor that pushes protein deposition and neuronal injury over the disease threshold. We further encourage the development of preventing strategies and drug screening based on mechanical stress models. Copyright © 2016 The Alzheimer's Association.",Excluded
2447,"Unmyelinated visceral afferents exhibit frequency dependent action potential broadening while myelinated visceral afferents do not Sensory information arising from visceral organ systems is encoded into action potential trains that propagate along afferent fibers to target nuclei in the central nervous system. These information streams range from tight patterns of action potentials that are well synchronized with the sensory transduction event to irregular, patternless discharge with no clear correlation to the sensory input. In general terms these afferent pathways can be divided into unmyelinated and myelinated fiber types. Our laboratory has a long standing interest in the functional differences between these two types of afferents in terms of the preprocessing of sensory information into action potential trains (synchrony, frequency, duration, etc.), the reflexogenic consequences of this sensory input to the central nervous system and the ionic channels that give rise to the electrophysiological properties of these unique cell types. The aim of this study was to determine whether there were any functional differences in the somatic action potential characteristics of unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents in response to different rates of sensory nerve stimulation. Our results showed that activity and frequency-dependent widening of the somatic action potential was quite prominent in unmyelinated but not myelinated vagal afferents. Spike broadening often leads to increased influx of Ca(2+) ions that has been associated with a diverse range of modulatory mechanisms both at the cell body and central synaptic terminations (e.g. increased neurotransmitter release.) We conclude that our observations are indicative of fundamentally different mechanisms for neural integration of sensory information arising from unmyelinated and myelinated vagal afferents.",Excluded
2872,"Yttrium-90 Radioembolization for Liver Metastasis From Neuroendocrine Cancer: A Single-Institution Retrospective Review Purpose: Many publications can be found on the use of yttrium-90 (Y-90) transarterial radioembolization (TARE) for the treatment of primary liver cancer or liver metastasis from colorectal adenocarcinoma. It is important to study the results that could be achieved when TARE is being used to treat liver metastasis of other origin. This retrospective analysis concentrates on our institutional experience with TARE for the treatment of liver metastasis from neuroendocrine cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Our institutional review board (IRB)-approved Y-90 databank was reviewed to identify patients with neuroendocrine cancer who received Y-90 TARE for liver metastasis from February 2011 to September 2013. Information on patient demographics, performance status, disease-related characteristics (liver panel, complete blood count [CBC], chromogranin A, and gross tumor volume [GTV] measured in cc on the most recent study pre-TARE), treatment-related parameters (Y-90 dose delivered), and treatment outcome (treatment toxicity, overall survival [OS]) were captured for this analysis. Result(s): Between February 2011 and September 2013, a total of 16 patients with metastatic neuroendocrine (liver-predominant disease) received Y-90 TARE in our institution. Eight of these patients received treatment to both liver lobes, for a total of 24 procedures. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status between 0 and 2 prior to treatment. In addition, all patients had a bilirubin level below 2.0 and an albumin level above 3.0 prior to treatment. The median GTV per lobe was 299 cc (range: 27-670 cc). With a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range: 2-26 mo), the 1-year OS was 75%. There was no relationship between OS and GTV volume. Two patients with severe endocrine disorders that required repeated hospitalization (one patient with severe hypoglycemia and a second patient with hypertensive crisis) responded well to TARE, with marked improvement in their medical condition and no need for further admission postprocedure. In terms of treatment toxicity, one patient was diagnosed with a radiation-induced liver disease and died 13 months post-treatment. One patient developed a pancytopenia that was potentially related to treatment. Conclusion(s): The use of Y-90 TARE for patients with liver metastasis from neuroendocrine carcinoma is a treatment option that should be assessed in a prospective multicentric study. In this series, Y-90 TARE was associated with a high 1-year survival rate. However, patients need to be monitored closely postprocedure, since serious treatment-related toxicity could develop.",Excluded

3650,"Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation after cranial irradiation with (56)Fe particles Exposure to heavy-ion radiation is considered a potential health risk in long-term space travel. In the central nervous system (CNS), loss of critical cellular components may lead to performance decrements that could ultimately compromise mission goals and long-term quality of life. Hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments occur after exposure to ionizing radiation, and while the pathogenesis of this effect is not yet clear, it may involve the production of newly born neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We irradiated mice with 0.5-4 Gy of (56)Fe ions and 2 months later quantified neurogenesis and numbers of activated microglia as a measure of neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that there were few changes after 0.5 Gy, but that there was a dose-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and a dose-related increase in numbers of newly born activated microglia from 0.5-4.0 Gy. While those findings were similar to what was reported after X irradiation, there were also some differences, particularly in the response of newly born glia. Overall, this study showed that hippocampal neurogenesis was sensitive to relatively low doses of (56)Fe particles, and that those effects were associated with neuroinflammation. Whether these changes will result in functional impairments or if/how they can be managed are topics for further investigation.",Included
3357,"YKL-40 expression is associated with poorer response to radiation and shorter overall survival in glioblastoma PURPOSE: YKL-40 is a secreted protein that has been reported to be overexpressed in epithelial cancers and gliomas, although its function is unknown. Previous data in a smaller sample set suggested that YKL-40 was a marker associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a genetically defined subgroup of glioblastoma. Here we test these findings in a larger series of patients with glioblastoma, and in particular, determine if tumor YKL-40 expression is associated with radiation response.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=147) with subtotal resections were studied for imaging-assessed changes in tumor size in serial studies following radiation therapy. An additional set (n=140) of glioblastoma patients who underwent a gross-total resection was tested to validate the survival association and extend them to patients with minimal residual disease.RESULTS: In the subtotal resection group, higher YKL-40 expression was significantly associated with poorer radiation response, shorter time to progression and shorter overall survival. The association of higher YKL-40 expression with poorer survival was validated in the gross-total resection group. In multivariate analysis with both groups combined (n = 287), YKL-40 was an independent predictor of survival after adjusting for patient age, performance status, and extent of resection. YKL-40 expression was also compared with genetically defined subsets of glioblastoma by assessing epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and loss at chromosome 10q, two of the common recurring aberrations in these tumors, using fluorescent in situ hybridization. YKL-40 was significantly associated with 10q loss.CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate YKL-40 as an important marker of therapeutic response and genetic subtype in glioblastomas and suggest that it may play an oncogenic role in these tumors.",Included
3372,"Outcome Evaluation of Patients with Limited Brain Metastasis From Malignant Melanoma, Treated with Surgery, Radiation Therapy, and Targeted Therapy Objective The incidence of brain metastases from melanoma is increasing. Several effective treatment options are now available but what can be considered the optimal therapeutic strategy is not yet defined. We evaluated the outcome of patients with brain metastatic melanoma in terms of local control rate, brain distant progression, and overall survival. Methods The present retrospective study includes only patients with limited brain metastases (<=4) who underwent surgery plus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or SRS alone. Surgical resection was performed in patients with good Karnofsky performance score, single large brain lesions, controlled extracranial disease, and SRS alone in all other cases. Supramargical resection was performed in all patients. The prescribed radiotherapy doses were 24 Gy/1 fraction and 30 Gy in 3-5 fractions for lesions >2.5 cm. Clinical outcome was evaluated by brain magnetic resonance imaging performed 2 months after radiotherapy and then every 3 months. Results From April 2011 to October 2015, 53 patients were treated. The median age was 54 years (range, 29-82 years). Most of patients had 1-2 brain metastases (86.8%). Twelve patients (22.6%) underwent surgical resection followed by SRS on the tumor bed, and 41 (77.4%) received SRS alone. The median follow-up time was 20.9 months (range, 5.7-61.3 months). The median, 1-, 2-, 3-year overall survival were 11.8 months, 47.2%, 28%, and 21.8%, respectively. Factors recorded as influencing survival were the number of brain metastases, the melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment score, and BRAF mutated status. Conclusions Our data identifier a subset of patients with a more favorable outcome who could take advantage of a more aggressive local approach followed by targeted therapy.

2651,"Intracranial thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles combined with external beam radiotherapy: Results of a feasibility study on patients with glioblastoma multiforme We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of the newly developed thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles on recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Fourteen patients received 3-dimensional image guided intratumoral injection of aminosilane coated iron oxide nanoparticles. The patients were then exposed to an alternating magnetic field to induce particle heating. The amount of fluid and the spatial distribution of the depots were planned in advance by means of a specially developed treatment planning software following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The actually achieved magnetic fluid distribution was measured by computed tomography (CT), which after matching to pre-operative MRI data enables the calculation of the expected heat distribution within the tumor in dependence of the magnetic field strength. Patients received 4-10 (median: 6) thermotherapy treatments following instillation of 0.1-0.7 ml (median: 0.2) of magnetic fluid per ml tumor volume and single fractions (2 Gy) of a radiotherapy series of 16-70 Gy (median: 30). Thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles was tolerated well by all patients with minor or no side effects. Median maximum intratumoral temperatures of 44.6degreeC (42.4-49.5degreeC) were measured and signs of local tumor control were observed. In conclusion, deep cranial thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles can be safely applied on glioblastoma multiforme patients. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.",Excluded
3139,"Nitric oxide as a mediator of parasympathetic vasodilation in ocular and extraocular tissues in the rabbit Purpose. The aim of this study was to investigate in rabbits the relationship between nitric oxide and the noncholinergic vasodilation caused by facial nerve stimulation in the eye and some extraocular tissues. Methods. Uveal vascular resistance was determined by measuring simultaneously the flow from a cannulated vortex vein with intraocular pressure and arterial blood pressure recordings. The local blood flow in different parts of the eye (iris, ciliary body, choroid, and retina), eyelids, nictitating membrane, Harderian gland, and lacrimal gland was determined using radioactive microspheres. The effects of facial nerve stimulation, at different frequencies, were examined before and alter the administration of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors. Results. In the experiments with direct determination of uveal blood flow, stimulation of the facial nerve caused a frequency-dependent decrease in uveal vascular resistance, indicating vasodilation. This effect was reduced or abolished by NOS inhibition at low frequencies but was unaffected at high frequencies. Determination of regional blood flow, with radioactive microspheres, showed that the stimulation increased local blood flow in all parts of the urea. Compared to the nonstimulated control side, stimulation at 2 Hz increased choroidal blood flow by 89% +/- 12% before NOS inhibition and by 45% +/- 10% after NOS inhibition, a difference of 44% +/- 77% (n = 9; P <= 0.05). Iris and ciliary body vasodilation appeared to be equally reduced. In eyelids, Harderian gland, and lacrimal gland, the vasodilation elicited by stimulation at 2 Hz was abolished almost completely by NOS inhibition. The vasodilation in most of the extraocular tissues was reduced significantly by NOS inhibition at 5 Hz, with only a slight reduction in the choroid, iris, and ciliary body. Retinal blood flow also was significantly increased by facial nerve stimulation at 2 Hz and 5 Hz. The increase in retinal blood flow appeared to be more sensitive to NOS inhibition than the increase in uveal blood flow. Conclusions. These results suggest that the formation of nitric oxide plays an important role in the uveal, retinal, and extraocular vasodilation brought about by facial nerve stimulation at low frequencies. At high frequencies, other neurotransmitters also seem to be involved.",Excluded
2865,"[A case of chronic progressive radiation myelopathy--a diagnostic significance of gadolinium-DTPA enhancement MRI] A 65-year-old man had a biopsy diagnosis of right cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Post operative irradiation (4000 rads) was given to the bilateral cervical areas. Twenty five months after completion of irradiation, the patient developed muscle weakness in the right upper and lower extremities, and sensory disturbance below the C2 level in the left side, which was considered as Brown-Sequard syndrome. MRI of T1 weighted images (T1W1) showed mild swelling of the spinal cord from C1 to C6, while T2 weighted images (T2W1) revealed high intensity area at the same level. Gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA injection revealed ring enhancement in the right side of the spinal cord from C1 to C2 on sagittal and axial images. The neurological symptoms improved after the administration of corticosteroid. Two weeks after the therapy, a follow-up study revealed disappearance of cervical cord swelling on T1W1 and high intensity area was remarkably diminished on T2W1.

2894,"Target delineation and optimal radiosurgical dose for pituitary tumors Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivered as either single-fraction or multi-fraction SRS (2-5 fractions) is frequently employed in patients with residual or recurrent pituitary adenoma. The most common delivery systems used for SRS include the cobalt-60 system Gamma Knife, the CyberKnife (CK) robotic radiosurgery system, or a modified conventional radiotherapy machine (linear accelerator, LINAC). Tumor control and normalization of hormone hypersecretion have been reported in 75-100 % and 25-80 % of patients, respectively. Hypopituitarism is the most commonly reported late complication of radiation treatment, whereas other toxicities occur less frequently. We have provided an overview of the recent available literature on SRS in patients with a pituitary adenoma. Critical aspects of pituitary irradiation, including target delineation and doses to organs at risk, optimal radiation dose, as well as the long-term efficacy and toxicity of SRS for either nonfunctioning or secreting pituitary adenomas are discussed. Single-fraction SRS represents an effective treatment for patients with a pituitary adenoma; however, caution should be used for lesions > 2.5-3 cm in size and/or involving the anterior optic pathway. Future studies will be necessary to optimize target doses and critical organ dose constrains in order to reduce the long-term toxicity of treatments while maintaining high efficacy.",Excluded
2540,"Preclinical radiotherapy at the Australian Synchrotron's Imaging and Medical Beamline: instrumentation, dosimetry and a small-animal feasibility study Therapeutic applications of synchrotron X-rays such as microbeam (MRT) and minibeam (MBRT) radiation therapy promise significant advantages over conventional clinical techniques for some diseases if successfully transferred to clinical practice. Preclinical studies show clear evidence that a number of normal tissues in animal models display a tolerance to much higher doses from MRT compared with conventional radiotherapy. However, a wide spread in the parameters studied makes it difficult to make any conclusions about the associated tumour control or normal tissue complication probabilities. To facilitate more systematic and reproducible preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies, a dedicated preclinical station including small-animal irradiation stage was designed and installed at the Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) at the Australian Synchrotron. The stage was characterized in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the vertical scanning speed, as this is the key variable in dose delivery. The measured speed was found to be within 1% of the nominal speed for the range of speeds measured by an interferometer. Furthermore, dose measurements confirm the expected relationship between speed and dose and show that the measured dose is independent of the scan direction. Important dosimetric parameters such as peak dose, valley dose, the collimator output factor and peak-to-valley dose ratio are presented for 5 mm x 5 mm, 10 mm x 10 mm and 20 mm x 20 mm field sizes. Finally, a feasibility study on three glioma-bearing rats was performed. MRT and MBRT doses were prescribed to achieve an average dose of 65 Gy in the target, and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up was performed at various time points after irradiation to follow the tumour volume. Although it is impossible to draw conclusions on the different treatments with such a small number of animals, the feasibility of end-to-end preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies using the IMBL preclinical stage is demonstrated.",Excluded

Evidence suggests that single target plans do not require as many arcs as single isocentre, multiple target plans but there are trade-offs.1,2 The aim of this study was to determine the optimal arc selection from HyperArcs class solution beam geometries for post-surgical cavities for stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Method(s): For 16 retrospective solitary post-surgical cavity cases, HyperArc plans comprising different arc geometries were generated. Prescribed dose for all plans was 24 Gy in 3 fractions with D99% >= utilising 10 MVFFF. Metrics analysed including indices: CI100 RTOG, CI50 RTOG, CI Paddick, GI Paddick, HI (ICRU 83) and plan complexity using modulation factor (MF) (MU/dose per fraction in cGy) comparing default arc selection versus varying arc selections. Result(s): The mean CI100 RTOG for default arc selection was 1.10 (1.03-1.25) compared to 1.11 (1.05-1.24) for the comparison plans. The mean CI50 RTOG for default arc selection was 3.24 (2.70-5.44) compared to 3.25 (2.79-4.46) for the comparison plans.

Discussion/Conclusion: Analysis highlighted minimal differences when comparing default arc selection to varying arc selection. Due to no clear benefit for either groups of plans, consideration in the decision making was given to both treatment time and isocentre verification at individual couch angles. Therefore, minimising arc angles for solitary intra-cranial lesions was the preferred option.",Excluded
3006,"Design and evaluation of learning strategies for a group of radiographers in radiostereometric analysis (RSA) Introduction The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a radiostereometric analysis (RSA) program aimed at radiographers in order to increase their cognitive and practical skills, thereby increasing image quality and minimizing exposure repetition. Methods and materials Twenty radiographers were randomized into two identically sized study groups. Training consisted of a theoretical and practical workshop using a phantom. Tests were performed to compare the effect of training to nontraining, and the effect of time duration on the maintenance of RSA skills. The effect of training was measured by a written test and three defined parameters influencing image quality. Results Group A reduced significantly (p < 0.001) by 31.3 mm (21-31%) the distance between the centrum of the prosthesis (CP) and the centrum of the calibration field (CCF) and increased the number of beads (NB) visible by 3.6 (out of 18). A further significant reduction of 5.1 mm (p = 0.023), 1.0 bead more (p < 0.001) and a 2.1 (p = 0.022) point better rotation of the prosthesis (RP) was registered two months later. Group B was tested twice without training and no significant improvement was registered. One month after training group B had experienced overall significant improvement on a par with group A. Conclusion It is realistic to implement an RSA X-ray training program where radiographers significantly improve their theoretical and practical skills in centering the CP closer to the CCF, NB and RP. A duration of up to two months after training does not influence the quality of participants' performance. Copyright © 2017 The College of Radiographers",Excluded
3024,"Low amounts of the DNA repair XPA protein are sufficient to recover UV-resistance DNA integrity is threatened by the damaging effects of physical and chemical agents that can affect its function. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the most known and flexible mechanisms of DNA repair. This mechanism can recognize and remove damages causing DNA double-helix distortion, including the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts, promoted by ultraviolet light (UV). The human syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is clinically characterized chiefly by the early onset of severe photosensitivity of the exposed regions of the skin, a very high incidence of skin cancers and frequent neurological abnormalities. The xpa gene seems to be involved during UV damage recognition, in both global genome repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled repair (TCR). The modulation of xpa expression may modify the DNA repair rate in the cell genome, providing a valuable contribution to an understanding of the NER process. The controlled expression of the cDNA xpa in XP12RO deficient cells was achieved through the transfection of a muristerone-A inducible vector, pINXA. The INXA15 clone shows good induction of the XPA protein and total complementation of XP12RO cell deficiency. Overexpression of this protein resulted in UV cell survival comparable to normal control human cells. Moreover, low expression of the XPA protein in these cells is sufficient for total complementation in cellular UV sensitivity and DNA repair activity. These data demonstrate that XPA protein concentration is not a limiting factor for DNA repair.",Excluded
3141,"Stereotactic Radiosurgery in the Multimodality Management of Residual or Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme Management options for residual or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are limited despite advances in surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiotherapeutic techniques. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is often beneficial in such cases providing improved survival of patients, but still remains underutilized as part of the multimodality management of malignant gliomas. During the last 20 years, 297 patients with histologically proven residual or recurrent GBM underwent Gamma Knife surgery in the University of Pittsburgh. Retrospective analysis of outcomes revealed median survival after initial diagnosis of 18 months, and 1- and 2-year survival rates of 72.5 and 29.5%, respectively. Median survival from the time of SRS was 9 months. The use of modified RPA (recursive partitioning analysis) classification demonstrated superior survival in our series in comparison with historical data. Important prognostic variables include tumor volume <14 cm3, marginal radiation dose of >=15 Gy, and younger age of the patients (<60 years). Adverse radiation effects (ARE) were noted in 23% of cases and were mainly controlled with corticosteroids. Combining SRS with bevacizumab resulted in further improvement of the overall and progression-free survival and decreased incidence of ARE. Nevertheless, for future application of SRS in patients with GBM, evaluation of its efficacy in a well-designed prospective controlled clinical trials seems mandatory.",Excluded
2696,"Low serum 25 (OH) vitamin D level is associated with increased risk of primary CNS malignancy: A retrospective cohort study in a veteran population BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency has been reported to be associated with numerous malignancies, presumed to be secondary to its action through VitD receptor, immune and cell cycle regulation. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the relationship between VitD (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D]) levels and primary brain malignancy. METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective cohort study of veterans who received care through VHA from January 2000 to December 2015 and had their VitD levels measured at least once over the course of their care. Primary outcome measure was the incidence of primary brain malignancy in relation to VitD levels. Exclusion criteria included diagnoses of metastatic brain cancer, meningeal, spinal, face, neck and throat malignancies; VitD measurements in the months of November to February; exposure to ionizing radiation; and presence of genetic factors predisposing to brain tumors formation. Propensity score matching and survival analyses were conducted on the cohorts to determine and compare the incidence and hazard ratios for brain malignancy between two groups of subjects. Group 1: subjects with VitD levels higher than 20 ng/ml; and Group 2: subjects with VitD deficiency defined as <= 20ng/ml. Kaplan Meier curves were plotted to compare the time to events between the groups. RESULT(S): After matching the two groups on several confounders (Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking Status, Alcohol Abuse, Race, Ethnicity), the incidence of primary brain malignancy was significantly higher in Group 2 (384/251,636; 154 per 100,000) in comparison with Group 1 (992/694,707; 143 per 100,000). VitD deficiency was associated with higher risk of primary brain malignancy (HR 1.129, CI [1.004 -1.269] p <0.05). Kaplan Meier analysis showed subjects with vitamin D had lower probability of survival free from primary brain malignancy that was statistically significant. CONCLUSION(S): Findings from this study suggests increased risk of primary brain malignancy in subjects with VitD deficiency.",Excluded

Learning Objective #2: Burkitt Lymphoma subtype as well as CNS involvement represent more aggressive manifestations of PTLD and should be managed more aggressively. CASE: 72 year-old man with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy status post living donor renal transplant on tacro-limus presents with headache, diplopia, and blurry vision found to have CNIII palsy on neurologic examination. Facial CT and Gadolinium enhanced Brain MRI showed complete bilateral maxillary sinus opacification and leptomeningeal enhancement. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, but given continuous headache and concern for meningitis a lumbar puncture was performed. CSF studies showed atypical lymphocytes of predominantly monoclonal B cells. CSF FISH showed rearrangement of c-myc oncogene negative for rearrangement of bcl6 or bcl2. Serum LDH was elevated and peripheral EBV PCR was positive. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for malignancy. Further CT imaging revealed thickening of the small bowel and mesenteric lymph-adenopathy. Patient was started on dexamethasone, intrathecal metho-trexate, and R-Hyper CVAD with interval regression of abdominal LAD, mass, improvement in ptosis, and decrease in LDH. IMPACT: The case represents an uncommon manifestation of an rare variant of disease that should warrant a different approach to diagnosis and treatment. DISCUSSION: PTLD is a well recognized, heterogenous group of disorders. The mechanism of PTLD involves EBV-induced B cell proliferation and antigen mediated T cell activation which upregulate pro-growth factors such as c-Myc. The result of which ranges from early mononucleosis-like illness, polyclonal lymphoid infiltrates, to lymphomas. Therapy involves immune reconstitution, local surgical excision, corticosteroids, antiviral agents, radiation and chemotherapy. Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) is a distinct form of PTLD. BL is an aggressive, mature B cell lymphoma composed of a monomorphic population of lymphoid cells with high mitotic and proliferation rates. Monoclonality is shown as isolated c-myc rearrangement as opposed to rear-rangements in c-myc, bcl6, and bcl2 seen in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the most common form of PTLD. BL represents a distinct monomorphic PTLD and should be managed more aggressively with lymphoma specific chemotherapy rather than simply decreasing immunosuppression. CNS involvement of PTLD is rare, reportedly in 7-15% of all PTLD, when present is predictive of inferior survival. Compared to non-PCNS PTLD, primary CNS PTLD has a higher incidence of monomorphic EBV related disease, and late involvement with poor survival. Prior kidney transplant were also more frequent in primary CNS PTLD compared to other forms of PTLD. As a parallel, in systemic non hodgkins lymphoma, renal localization is also associated with high rates of CNS involvement.",Excluded
3622,"Avoidance of radiation induced alopecia en whole brain radiotherapy treatments with simultaneous integrated boost Purpose/Objective: Radiation-induced alopecia in hypofractionated whole brain radiation therapy with simultaneous integrated boost (WBRT+SIB) is an understudied issue, even in RTOG 9508. However, this effect has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients. We have currently found a technical solution to this problem. Our current protocol for WBRT+SIB is presented and described, incluiding a retrospective review of the results in relation to radiation-induced alopecia. Material(s) and Method(s): The protocol already implemented in our department is based on a frame-less procedure compatible with masks of type 35764/2MA/M (Orfit Industries N.V., Wijnegem, Belgium), submasks of eXaSkin (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain) and a resonance compatible frame eXaFrame (Anatomical Geometry S.L., Sevilla, Spain). CT and MR studies of 1mm slice thickness are acquired with similar length, position and inmovilization. The whole procedure and the resulting high quality fussion is ensured by the eXaFrame system. Treatments were designed using VMAT in Treatment System Planning Pinnacle V.9.2 (Philips N.V, Koninklijke Holland) with multiple arcs, and delivered with a linear accelerator Elekta Synergy (Elekta A.B., Stockholm, Sweden). The dose scheme used is the one reported by Lagerwaard: [WBRT(20Gy) + SIBmts (40Gy)]/5 fr. Patient positioning is verified daily using IGRT with Elekta XVI, before and after treatment. Before optimization is performed, some auxiliary volumes are created: a 3mm ring around calota,called Follicles, and a volume contracted 12mm from the outer one, called CPE. Two CCW VMAT arcs (178degree to 60degree and 300degree to 182degree) are added, with the following objectives: Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 1), brain-CPE (D<inf>max</inf>= 21 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 20 Gy, weight = 50), eyes(D<inf>max</inf>= 10 Gy, weight = 1). Thereafter, we work separately on the metastases blocking the optimization of the prophylaxis and creating three structures: VI1 = PTV (MTS1)+ 5 mm, VI2 = PTV (MTS2)+ 5 mm, Epx = brain-VI1-VI2. Objectives were: PTVI (D<inf>max</inf>= 44 Gy, weight = 100 and D<inf>min</inf>= 40 Gy weight = 50), Epx (D<inf>max</inf>= 30 Gy) ,brain stem (D<inf>max</inf>= 23 Gy) and Follicles (EQD2max = 16 Gy, weight = 20; EQD2max = 5 Gy, weight = 20). Result(s): We have treated 14 patients until now. Fusion images have shown differences less than 1mm while mean IGRT correction has been 1.34mm. No acute toxicity have been observed, including neither alopecia nor temporal depilation. Conclusion(s): This protocol has been designed and developed in our hospital, considering the alopecia as toxicity in VMAT optimization. It produces excellent cosmetic results, avoiding alopecia in practically all cases, which has a direct impact on patient quality of life. As a general consideration, we would like to point out that that it should be considered mandatory to use all advanced tools available on modern radiotherapy to minimize toxicity in radiation treatments.",Excluded

2732,"Neurocognitive functioning in adults who underwent nonmyeloablative hla-matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD) Background: Individuals with SCD are at risk for neurocognitive impairments. While potentially curative, SCTs come with their own risk of neurotoxicities, particularly from radiation and high-dose ablative chemotherapies. Newer, nonmyeloablative regimens may prevent some of these toxicities. This study examines the long-term cognitive impact of nonmyeloablative transplants in adults with SCD. Method(s): Seventeen adults (11 males; mean age = 32.2 years, SD=9.0, range 17-52) participated in neuropsychological evaluations before transplant and 12 months posttransplant, as part of a research protocol at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Donors were HLA-matched siblings; the conditioning regimen consisted of alemtuzumab and 300cGy total body irradiation, and they received sirolimus for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Evaluations assessed global cognition, processing speed, memory, attention, and executive functions. Patients completed the PROMIS Physical Functioning questionnaire. Result(s): Global cognition was within normal limits. Mean Verbal and Performance IQ scores were average at baseline and follow-up, with no significant changes noted. Mean processing speed scores were average, and increased significantly from baseline (M=92.1, SD=10.1) to 12 months (M=99.2, SD=11.6, t=2.1, p=.013). Mean scores on memory, attention and executive tests were average and stable across time points. No group declines in mean cognitive scores were noted. Mean t-scores on the physical functioning questionnaire increased from 41.6 (SD=4.7) to 49.0 (SD=10.0; t=3.4, p=.01), indicating significant improvement from baseline to 12 months post-transplant. Hemoglobin levels increased significantly from pre-transplant (M=9.1, SD=0.9) to posttransplant (M=13.1, SD=2.2; t=8.9, p<=.0001). Conclusion(s): In this small sample, a comparison of neurocognitive scores from baseline to 12 months post-nonmyeloablative SCT does not indicate any deleterious effects from transplant. In fact, a significant improvement emerged in mental processing speed. Physical functioning also improved per patient questionnaires. As suggested by some prior research, the significant increase in hemoglobin levels may underlie improvements in processing speed.",Excluded
3420,"Lung cancer: ASCO 2014 update At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting 2014, the most striking abstracts on lung cancer treatment addressed-as expected-aspects of targeted therapy. The most probable practice changing data came from the presentation of the PROFILE 1014 trial dealing with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small-cell lung carcinoma patients treated with crizotinib or chemotherapy in the first-line setting, which confirmed a comparable degree of benefit from crizotinib treatment as reported in second-line treatment. After 10 years of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy, there were for the first time reports on phase I data on new agents showing efficacy in tyrosine-kinase inhibitor pre-treated patients with secondary resistance (i.e. T790M mutation). Monoclonal antibodies directed against EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor given in addition to conventional chemotherapy (SQUIRE and REVEL, respectively) resulted in significant but less impressive results. Notable improvements in overall survival in these two studies were not restricted to patients with adenocarcinoma but proved beneficial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma as well. Unfortunately, as in the aftermath of many past ASCO meetings, there will be no significant changes concerning systemic treatment of small cell lung cancer in the near future.

3585,"A multi-center analysis of single-fraction versus hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of brain metastasis BACKGROUND: Hypofractionated-SRS (HF-SRS) may allow for improved local control and a reduced risk of radiation necrosis compared to single-fraction-SRS (SF-SRS). However, data comparing these two treatment approaches are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes between SF-SRS versus HF-SRS across our multi-center academic network.METHODS: Patients treated with SF-SRS or HF-SRS for brain metastasis from 2013 to 2018 across 5 radiation oncology centers were retrospectively reviewed. SF-SRS dosing was standardized, whereas HF-SRS dosing regimens were variable. The co-primary endpoints of local control and radiation necrosis were estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed to evaluate the impact of select independent variables on the outcomes of interest. Propensity score adjustments were used to reduce the effects confounding variables. To assess dose response for HF-SRS, Biologic Effective Dose (BED) assuming an alpha/beta of 10 (BED<sub>10</sub>) was used as a surrogate for total dose.RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty six patients with 335 brain metastasis treated with SF-SRS (n = 222 lesions) or HF-SRS (n = 113 lesions) were included. Prior whole brain radiation was given in 33% (n = 74) and 34% (n = 38) of lesions treated with SF-SRS and HF-SRS, respectively (p = 0.30). After a median follow up time of 12 months in each cohort, the adjusted 1-year rate of local control and incidence of radiation necrosis was 91% (95% CI 86-96%) and 85% (95% CI 75-95%) (p = 0.26) and 10% (95% CI 5-15%) and 7% (95% CI 0.1-14%) (p = 0.73) for SF-SRS and HF-SRS, respectively. For lesions > 2 cm, the adjusted 1 year local control was 97% (95% CI 84-100%) for SF-SRS and 64% (95% CI 43-85%) for HF-SRS (p = 0.06). On multivariate analysis, SRS fractionation was not associated with local control and only size <=2 cm was associated with a decreased risk of developing radiation necrosis (HR 0.21; 95% CI 0.07-0.58, p < 0.01). For HF-SRS, 1 year local control was 100% for lesions treated with a BED<sub>10</sub> >= 50 compared to 77% (95% CI 65-88%) for lesions that received a BED<sub>10</sub> < 50 (p = 0.09).CONCLUSIONS: In this comparison study of dose fractionation for the treatment of brain metastases, there was no difference in local control or radiation necrosis between HF-SRS and SF-SRS. For HF-SRS, a BED<sub>10</sub> >= 50 may improve local control.",Excluded
2812,"Idiopathic occipital neuralgia a rare cause of debilitating headache LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Identify the presentation of occipital neuralgia LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Judicious use of diagnostic tools and treatment CASE: A 27-year-old female presented to the ER with episodes of severe intermittent headache over the past 3 weeks. Prior to her presentation at admission she reported 2 episodes of intermittent pain on the right occipital region. She promptly followed with her primary care physician who prescribed her oral steroids. The 2 weeks following the initial episodes were symptom free. On the day of admission she was watching television when she experienced a recurrence of the 10/10 right sided occipital headache with radiation over her vertex. Initial vital signs were unremarkable, however, physical exam was significant for tenderness over the right occipital region of the scalp. Labs were within normal limits. MRI did not reveal any abnormality. A consultation to neurology was obtained and the patient was started on carbamazepine, gabapentin and narcotics, which provided little relief. The patient's distribution of pain in the greater occipital area in addition to ruling out secondary causes of headache made ON the likely diagnosis. Pain management was consulted and greater occipital nerve block was performed which provided complete resolution of her symptoms. She was discharged home with carbamazepine the following morning and continued to be symptom free at follow up. DISCUSSION: Occipital neuralgia is usually defined as paroxysmal stabbing pain in the greater or lesser occipital nerve distribution. Although there is no published data to suggest the incidence of occipital neuralgia (ON), it is generally considered a very rare cause of headache. ON is a rare cause of headache that has no published data on incidence. Since this is a rare disorder there is limited evidence in the literature to support the full understanding of its physiology and treatment. Currently, the diagnosis ismade by history, characteristics described in the International Headache Society, exclusion of referred pain by CT/MRI and anesthetic block of the occipital nerve. Patients with severe symptoms can continue to have a debilitating headache despite conservative management. The best treatment in the acute setting is the same intervention for diagnosis, which is an occipital nerve block. Patients with recurrent ON symptoms despite steroid injections benefit from botulinium injections and pulsed radiofrequency. This case illustrates the detailed diagnostic evaluation and the need for high suspicion by the primary physicians to consider ON. It is often challenging to diagnose, yet it is critical to do so as early diagnosis and treatment can maximize recovery.",Excluded
2453,"Rapamycin attenuates visible light-induced injury in retinal photoreceptor cells via inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress An extended exposure of the retina to visible light may lead to photochemical damage in retinal photoreceptor cells. The exact mechanism of retinal light damage remains unknown, and an effective therapy is still unavailable. Here, we demonstrated that rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), markedly protected 661W photoreceptor cells from visible light exposure-induced damage at the nanomolar level. We also observed by transmission electron microscopy that light exposure led to severe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in 661W cells as well as abnormal endomembranes and ER membranes. In addition, obvious upregulated ER stress markers were monitored by western blot at the protein level and by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the mRNA level. Interestingly, rapamycin pretreatment significantly suppressed light-induced ER stress and all three major branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR), including the RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathways both at the protein and mRNA levels. Additionally, the inhibition of ER stress by rapamycin was further confirmed with a dithiothreitol (DTT; a classical ER stress inducer)-damaged 661W cell model. Meanwhile, our results also revealed that rapamycin was able to remarkably inhibit the activation of mTOR and its downstream factors eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), p-4EBP1, p70, p-p70, and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p-S6K) in the light-injured 661W cells. Thus, these data indicate that visible light induces ER stress in 661W cells; whereas the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, effectively protects 661W cells from light injury through suppressing the ER stress pathway.",Excluded
3119,"Growth of beta-amyloid(1-40) protofibrils by monomer elongation and lateral association. Characterization of distinct products by light scattering and atomic force microscopy Amyloid plaques in brain tissue are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Primary components of these plaques are 40- and 42-residue peptides, denoted A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42), that are derived by proteolysis of cellular amyloid precursor protein. Synthetic A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) form amyloid fibrils in vitro that share many features with the amyloid in plaques. Soluble intermediates in A beta fibrillogenesis, termed protofibrils, have been identified previously, and here we describe the in vitro formation and isolation of A beta(1-40) protofibrils by size exclusion chromatography. In some experiments, the A beta(1-40) was radiomethylated to better quantify various A beta species. Mechanistic studies clarified two separate modes of protofibril growth, elongation by monomer deposition and protofibril-protofibril association, that could be resolved by varying the NaCl concentration. Small isolated protofibrils in dilute Tris-HCl buffers were directed along the elongation pathway by addition of A beta(1-40) monomer or along the association pathway by addition of NaCl. Multi-angle light scattering analysis revealed that protofibrils with initial molecular masses M(w) of (7-30) x 10(3) kDa grew to M(w) values of up to 250 x 10(3) kDa by these two growth processes. However, the mass per unit length of the associated protofibrils was about 2-3 times that of the elongated protofibrils. Rate constants for further elongation by monomer deposition with the elongated, associated, and initial protofibril pools were identical when equal number concentrations of original protofibrils were compared, indicating that the original number of protofibril ends had not been altered by the elongation or association processes. Atomic force microscopy revealed heterogeneous initial protofibrils that became more rodlike following the elongation reaction. Our data indicate that protofibril elongation in the absence of NaCl results from monomer deposition only at the ends of protofibrils and proceeds without an increase in protofibril diameter. In contrast, protofibril association occurs in the absence of monomer when NaCl is introduced, but this association involves lateral interactions that result in a relatively disordered fibril structure.",Excluded

[Japanese] C-T scan findings in glioma and brain tissue after irradiation were histopathologically analyzed with the post-mortem examination of 4 patients. High density of contrast enhancement observed in gliomas mainly corresponded to proliferation of irregular blood vessels and hypodensity reflected less cellular area or necrotic foci in the tumor tissue. A mottled lesion with high density margin in C-T of radionecrosis of the brain tissue observed in a non-glioma patient was formed by coagulation necrosis showing marked proliferation of telangiectatic blood vessels in periphery of lesion and acellular area in the center. It is occasionally impossible to differentiate the findings between delayed radionecrosis of brain and recurrence of glioma using the C-T criteria alone.,Excluded

ON included optic neuritis (NNO) and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). For each subject, the PLR was recorded, to red, yellow, green, and blue stimuli for durations of 4 and 12 s, and for stimulus intensities of 4 lx and 28 lx.RESULTS: Comparison between control and RP or ON patient results showed that responses after stimulus onset were significantly different for most stimulus conditions, but the post-stimulus amplitudes at 3 s and 7 s after light extinction were not. On the other hand, the difference between the ON and RP groups was significant only for post-stimuli time-points and only for blue stimuli. Differences between responses to blue and red were significantly different, predominantly at post stimulus time-points. A ROC analysis revealed that the maximal constriction amplitudes to a 4 lx, 4 s yellow stimulus are significantly different in ON vs RP patients, and the responses to a 4 s, 28 lx blue stimulus at 7 s post-stimulus are significantly different in controls vs ON vs RP patients with a high specificity.CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary light responses to blue light in healthy, RP, and ON subjects are significantly different from one another. The optimal stimuli for future protocols was found to be a 4 s blue stimulus at 28 lx, and a 4 s yellow stimulus at 4 lx.",Excluded
2634,"Solution X-ray scattering evidence for agonist- and antagonist-induced modulation of cleft closure in a glutamate receptor ligand-binding domain Agonist-induced conformational changes in the ligand-binding domains (LBD) of glutamate receptor ion channels provide the driving force for molecular rearrangements that mediate channel opening and subsequent desensitization. The resulting regulated transmembrane ion fluxes form the basis for most excitatory neuronal signaling in the brain. Crystallographic analysis of the GluR2 LBD core has revealed a ligand-binding cleft located between two lobes. Channel antagonists stabilize an open cleft, whereas agonists stabilize a closed cleft. The crystal structure of the apo form is similar to the antagonist-bound, open state. To understand the conformational behavior of the LBD in the absence of crystal lattice constraints, and thus better to appreciate the thermodynamic constraints on ligand binding, we have undertaken a solution x-ray scattering study using two different constructs encoding either the core or an extended LBD. In agreement with the GluR2 crystal structures, the LBD is more compact in the presence of agonist than it is in the presence of antagonist. However, the time-averaged conformation of the ligand-free core in solution is intermediate between the open, antagonist-bound state and the closed, agonist-bound state, suggesting a conformational equilibrium. Addition of peptide moieties that connect the core domain to the other functional domains in each channel subunit appears to constrain the conformational equilibrium in favor of the open state.",Excluded
2394,"Prospective assessment of gustatory function after radiotherapy for head and neck cancers BACKGROUND: Taste disorders are major causes of morbidity in patients undergoing head and neck irradiation. We quantitatively assessed the gustatory function of patients with head and neck cancers who underwent radiotherapy using recently developed standardised tools for measuring taste.METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing head and neck irradiation responded to a specific questionnaire and were assessed by olfactory and gustatory function tests. To assess changes over time, testing was performed before, immediately after, and at 2- and 4-week intervals following the start of radiotherapy. Concurrently, patients were evaluated for xerostomia from radiotherapy.RESULTS: A decrease in the taste recognition threshold was observed in the second week after the beginning of radiotherapy. The taste detection threshold improved within the 14th-18th week. Most affected patients demonstrated that their gustatory function primarily decreased independent of the olfactory function. Disturbances in taste were exponentially worsened beyond an accumulated dose of 30 Gy and involved all tastants. According to a multivariate analysis, radiation-induced taste impairment was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia. However, there was an association between the dose of irradiation and the severity of taste disturbance.CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, we found that the taste function was worse 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and returned to pretreatment levels within 4.5 months. Taste disturbances were exponentially worse beyond an accumulated dose of 20 Gy. Taste dysfunction after radiotherapy was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia, whereas only the dose of irradiation was associated with the severity of taste dysfunction.",Excluded
3380,"[Effect of the psychostimulants caffeine and methylphenidate on the efficiency of physical activity in rats exposed to ionizing radiation] The authors carried out studies on 267 male rats and examined the effect of ionizing irradation (single irradation with 737 roentgens) on the duration of swimming and on the alteration of this effect by psychic stimulators caffeine and methylphenidate, administered in overthreshold doses (30 and 50 mg/kg of body weight for caffeine and 5 and 10 mg/kg of body weight for methylphenidate). On the 7th day after irradiation there was statistically significant shortening of the duration of swimming in the control animals. The mentioned doses (statistically significant for the larger dose) were used in nonirradiated animals and the two psychic stimulators also shortened the duration of swimming in comparison with the control nonirradiated animals. This effect could be explained by hyperexcitatory action of these doses of caffeine and methylphenidate. As a result of this, desoptimization of the cerebral activity occurred and as a consequence of which was the diminution of the efficiency of the physical activity. Together with this they observed that both psychic stimulators partially counteracted the shortening of the duration of swimming of rats, caused by ionizing irradiation itself. This effect, especially for caffeine, could be explained by the induced of the ionizing irradiation increase in the sensitivity of cerebral phosphodiesterase of rats to its inhibitor caffeine as a result of which under these conditions the effect of caffeine on the level of cerebral cyclic AMP was reinforced. The cyclic AMP is presumed to have some protective effect against ionizing irradiation.",Included

2586,"Creation of endothelial-targeted adenoviral vectors for genetic engineering of the metastatic tumor microenvironment The endothelium is an attractive gene therapy target for metastatic cancer, providing access to systemic tumors. Previous work has focused on either viral entry/attachment (transductional targeting), or cell type specific enhancer promoter vector transgene expression regulation (transcriptional targeting). While previous studies demonstrated endothelial targeting, the tumor wide extent and transgene expression level quantification have been uncertain. Indeed, obtaining robust and stringent tumor expression has been challenging due to: insufficient transduction, focal rather than widespread intratumoral vascular expression, viral particle liver sequestration, and host preformed immunity. We developed a set of adenoviral vectors, containing 3 kb of the human ROBO4 enhancer/promoter, that are expressed at high levels throughout tumor vasculature. We now have three vectors representing four tiers of genetic modification. Transgenes encoding fluorescent proteins allowed us to quantify endothelial expression frequency by image analysis, and expression level using whole tissue Western blotting. Our first vector was Ad5.ROBO4. Compared with Ad5.CMV, Ad5.ROBO4 evidenced complete retargeting from hepatocytes to low-level expression in host organ and tumor endothelial cells. Warfarin-mediated hepatocyte detargeting produced a striking increase in tumor and bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial expression, without change in other host organs. Our second vector is Ad.RGD.H5/H3.ROBO4. Insertion of a cyclized RGD peptide in the fiber/knob HI loop engages enhanced tumor endothelial transduction via alphav/beta3 and alphav/beta5. Swapping hexon hypervariable regions responsible for Ad Type 5-Factor X binding with corresponding regions from serotype 3 enables marked diminution of hepatocyte sequestration. Use of the ROBO4 enhancer promoter produces high-level pan-intratumoral vascular expression particularly in cancers with markedly elevated VEGF production, such as orthotopic and metastatic renal cell carcinoma, orthotopic colonic liver metastases, and prostate cancer bone, brain, and liver metastases. Most striking, was enhancement of Ad.RGD.H5/H3.ROBO4 vector expression within interior tumor regions undergoing hypoxic necrosis; regions notoriously resistant to radiation or chemotherapies. Our third vector contains a polycistronic array, enabling triple transgene expression from a single vector within the tumor vasculature. Thus, we have panel of endothelial-targeted vectors with distinctive vascular tropism for use in cancers metastatic to individual host organs. These vectors enable expression of a palette of transgenes that can manipulate the tumor microenvironment to achieve metastatic growth inhibition alone, or ""staggered"" with chemo- or irradiation therapies.",Excluded
2518,"Cumulative genetic damage in hematopoietic stem cells in a patient with a 40-year exposure to alpha particles emitted by thorium dioxide Thorotrast, a colloidal suspension of the long-lived radionuclide, thorium-232, was widely used as a radiographic contrast medium for several decades. Due to the poor excretion of the sol, however, Thorotrast would deposit in the liver, bone marrow and other tissue, and patients would receive alpha-particle irradiation for life. To gauge the cumulative genetic damage to hematopoietic stem cells due to chronic exposure to alpha particles, we conducted a multi-end-point evaluation in a 72-year-old man who had been administered a 32-ml bolus of Thorotrast during cerebral angiography performed over 40 years ago in 1950. Peripheral T lymphocytes were cultured to quantify the frequencies and cellular distributions of asymmetrical and symmetrical types of chromosome aberrations in first-division metaphases and micronuclei in cytokinesis-arrested interphase II cells. Aberrations were scored using classical chromosome group analysis methods and chromosome painting techniques. Assays of glycophorin-A (GPA) mutations in red blood cells were also performed to obtain a relative measurement of damage sustained by the erythroid stem cell population. Results revealed that approximately 30% of the lymphocytes in this patient contained one or more chromosome aberrations, the majority of which were of the ""stable"" type. About one-third of the lymphocytes with chromosome damage carried multiple aberrations, suggesting that significant numbers of stem cells survive exposures to alpha-particle radiation that induce complex genomic alterations. Increased frequencies of GPA mutations were observed, demonstrating that genomic damage is also induced in erythroid progenitors. The numbers of micronuclei in lymphocytes were only moderately increased compared to expected values for persons of comparable age, and thus this end point was not useful for quantifying exposure level. Despite the relatively severe burden of somatic cell damage induced by 40 years of internal alpha-particle irradiation, the patient remains surprisingly free of any serious illness.",Excluded

Rats were stereotactically injected into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or striatum (STR) with app. 170kBq and scanned 24 h later. Behavioral (rotameter test) and histological (TH-staining) evaluation was performed after 4 weeks. Another group of rats was injected with a reduced radioactivity dose and the same toxicity evaluation took place at three time points. The influence of the radiation dose on the DNA integrity was tested with gH2AX-staining in a separate experiment. Finally, gradual transport of <sup>52</sup>Mn along the dopaminergic pathways was imaged continuously for 6 h in additional animals. Result(s): <sup>52</sup>Mn transport along the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways was clearly visible in PET images of the VTA-injected rats, as well as along the striatonigral tracts following the intrastriatal administration. Quantitative analysis of the PET data confirmed the tracer distribution in expected brain regions. Impaired motor control and dopaminergic lesion were found in some animals treated with the high radioactivity dose. This effect was completely abolished by reducing the dose to 20+/-5 kBq. There was also no increase in the double strand DNA breaks in the brain tissues treated with the lower dose as compared to the controls. Gradual <sup>52</sup>Mn transport along the mesolimbic pathway could be observed in dynamic PET images. Conclusion(s): <sup>52</sup>Mn traces neuronal pathways which can be imaged with PET.

Therapeutic doses are administered in 4 cycles with 6-10 week intervals. A high somatostatin receptor density on tumor cells is a prerequisite at every administration to enable effective therapy. In this study, the density of the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) was investigated in the rat CA20948 pancreatic tumor model after low dose [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate administration resulting in approximately 20 Gy tumor radiation absorbed dose, whereas 60 Gy is needed to induce complete tumor regression in these and the majority of tumors. Methods. Sixteen days after inoculation of the CA20948 tumor, male Lewis rats were injected with 185 MBq [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>, Tyr<sup>3</sup>]octreotate to initiate a decline in tumor size. Approximately 40 days after injection, tumors re-grew progressively after initial response. Quantification of sst2 expression was performed using in vitro autoradiography on frozen sections of three groups: control (not-treated) tumors, tumors in regression and tumors in re-growth. Histology and proliferation were determined using HE- and anti-Ki-67-staining. Results. The sst2 expression on CA20948 tumor cells decreased significantly after therapy to 5% of control level. However, tumors escaping from therapy showed an up-regulated sst2 level of 2-5 times higher sst2 density compared to control tumors. Conclusion. After a suboptimal therapeutic dose of [<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA<sup>0</sup>,Tyr<sup>3</sup>] octreotate, escape of tumors is likely to occur. Since these cells show an up-regulated sst2 receptor density, a next therapeutic administration of radio-labelled sst2 analogue can be expected to be highly effective.",Excluded

2831,"Role of thin-sliced reformatted ct imaging for acute ischemic stroke patients, do we need CT angiography before deciding for acute neurointervention? Objective: To investigate if thin-sliced reformatted non-contrast CT scans could be reliably used to detect and measure size of the thrombus in patients with LVOs. Background(s): Thin-sliced reformatted non-contrast CT head are not considered sensitive enough for thrombus detection. CTA is done to confirm large vessel occlusion. CTA adds extra radiation and contrast. Design/Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent acute endovascular intervention for LVOs at a community based, university affiliated comprehensive stroke center during two year period (Jan 2015-Dec 2016) was done. The raw data of non-enhanced CT scans and CTAs were collected. All raw data were reconstructed with thin slices of 0.625 mm using standard GE software. Vessel diameter and clot length were measured on both CT and CTA. (5- mm maximum intensity projections of the thin slices on CT and axial/coronal projections on CTA). Each patient's CT and CTA were paired for length and diameter in millimeters. Paired two sample hypothesis test was run on SPSS. Result(s): 926 patients presented with acute ischemic stroke during the specified time period. Of those 99 were LVOs that received endovascular treatment of which, 37 had both CT and CTA done and had intracranial lesions. Mean clot length was 13.99 (SD 5.34) on thin slices CT and 14.18 (SD 5.64) on CTA. Vessel diameter was 2.83 (SD 0.54) on thin sliced CT and 2.55 (SD 0.51) on CTA. There was no significant difference in estimated clot length done on CT as compared with CTA. (P=0.601) There was significant difference in estimated vessel diameter on CT as compared with CTA. Conclusion(s): Thin-sliced reconstructions of standard cranial nonenhanced CT raw data can be reliably used to detect and measure the thrombus size in LVOs. It does slightly overestimate the vessel diameter but still making intervention planning possible. Larger multicenter trials are needed to validate our data.",Excluded

3122,"S-Nitrosylation in Organs of Mice Exposed to Low or High Doses of gamma-Rays: The Modulating Effect of Iodine Contrast Agent at a Low Radiation Dose The covalent addition of nitric oxide (NO<sup>*</sup>) onto cysteine thiols, or S-nitrosylation, modulates the activity of key signaling proteins. The dysregulation of normal S-nitrosylation contributes to degenerative conditions and to cancer. To gain insight into the biochemical changes induced by low-dose ionizing radiation, we determined global S-nitrosylation by the ""biotin switch"" assay coupled with mass spectrometry analyses in organs of C57BL/6J mice exposed to acute 0.1 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma-rays. The dose of radiation was delivered to the whole body in the presence or absence of iopamidol, an iodinated contrast agent used during radiological examinations. To investigate whether similar or distinct nitrosylation patterns are induced following high-dose irradiation, mice were exposed in parallel to acute 4 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma rays. Analysis of modulated S-nitrosothiols (SNO-proteins) in freshly-harvested organs of animals sacrificed 13 days after irradiation revealed radiation dose- and contrast agent-dependent changes. The major results were as follows: (i) iopamidol alone had significant effects on S-nitrosylation in brain, lung and liver; (ii) relative to the control, exposure to 0.1 Gy without iopamidol resulted in statistically-significant SNO changes in proteins that differ in molecular weight in liver, lung, brain and blood plasma; (iii) iopamidol enhanced the decrease in S-nitrosylation induced by 0.1 Gy in brain; (iv) whereas a decrease in S-nitrosylation occurred at 0.1 Gy for proteins of ~50 kDa in brain and for proteins of ~37 kDa in liver, an increase was detected at 4 Gy in both organs; (v) mass spectrometry analyses of nitrosylated proteins in brain revealed differential modulation of SNO proteins (e.g., sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1; beta tubulins; ADP-ribosylation factor 5) by low- and high-dose irradiation; and (vi) ingenuity pathway analysis identified major signaling networks to be modulated, in particular the neuronal nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway was differentially modulated by low- and high-dose gamma-irradiation.",Included
2521,"Transforming growth factor-beta promotes glioblastoma multiforme to establish radiation resistance by mesenchymal differentiation Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor. Current standard therapy is surgery combined with radio-therapy and/or chemo-therapy. Due to the existence of resistance, GBM is one of the most difficult-to-treat tumor. It has been shown radio-therapy may induce mesenchymal differentiation (MD). Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a modifier of radiation response, and plays an important role in cell transformation. Therefore, we hypothesized that TGF-beta pathway might be involved in the development of radiation resistance via regulating MD. Thus, we explored whether TGF-beta regulates MD in radiation resistance in GBM. We first examined the effect of radiation doses on cell viability by Trypan blue assay, and evaluated cell viability and morphology. The cells showed morphology change were defined as transformed cells. We used the radiation dose of 50% cell viability to establish consecutive-irradiation-induced resistance. The radiation dose of the cell viability greater than 50% was established high-dose-irradiation-induced resistance positive control. When viability of cells recovered from consecutive-irradiation exposures which were higher than positive control, the cells were defined as consecutive-irradiation-induced resistance. To develop radiation resistance, 3.5Gy exposure for 6 times were required for 1306MG, and 2Gy exposure for 4 times were needed for U87MG. The numbers of transformed cells increased in radiation resistant cells population. Moreover, immunocytochemistry staining showed expression of certain MD markers on transformed cells were different from on non-transformed cells. Immunoblotting results showed increased mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and decreased epithelial marker beta-catenin in radiation resistance. Finally, we used TGF-beta and TGF-beta receptor inhibitor LY364947 to determine if TGF-beta/Smad pathway regulates radiation-induced resistance. The immunoblotting results revealed that inhibition of TGF-beta pathway reversed MD in consecutive-irradiation-induced resistant cell lines via increasing the expression of beta-catenin and reducing the expression of N-cadherin and Fibronectin. We concluded that TGF-beta promotes GBM to establish radiation resistance by MD.",Excluded
2533,"Substantia nigra stimulation influences monkey superior colliculus neuronal activity bilaterally The inhibitory drive arising from the basal ganglia is thought to prevent the occurrence of orienting movements of the eyes, head, and body in monkeys and other mammals. The direct projection from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to the superior colliculus (SC) mediates the inhibition. Since the original experiments in the SNr of monkeys the buildup or prelude neuron has been a focus of SC research. However, whether the SNr influences buildup neurons in SC is unknown. Furthermore, a contralateral SNr-SC pathway is evident in many species but remains unexplored in the alert monkey. Here we introduced electrical stimulation of one or both SNr nuclei while recording from SC buildup neurons. Stimulation of the SNr reduced the discharge rate of SC buildup neurons bilaterally. This result is consistent with activation of an inhibitory drive from SNr to SC. The time course of the influence of ipsilateral SNr on the activity of most SC neurons was longer (approximately 73 ms) than the influence of the contralateral SNr (approximately 34 ms). We also found that the variability of saccade onset time and saccade direction was altered with electrical stimulation of the SNr. Taken together our results show that electrical stimulation activates the inhibitory output of the SNr that in turn, reduces the activity of SC buildup neurons in both hemispheres. However, rather than acting as a gate for saccade initiation, the results suggest that the influence of SNr inhibition on visually guided saccades is more subtle, shaping the balance of excitation and inhibition across the SC.",Excluded
3059,"[Sellar fibrosarcoma following radiotherapy for prolactinoma] A 51-year-old house woman visited the Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka University Hospital for examination of the head injury on Oct. 7, 1975. Neurological examination was normal. Endocrinological examination showed galactorrhea. The patient had a past history of premature menopause. Plain skull films revealed enlargement of sella turcica and CT scan showed sellar tumor with suprasellar expansion which was enhanced by contrast medium. The serum prolactin (PRL) level was 3,290 ng/ml. Diagnosis of PRL secreting pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma) was made. Though surgical removal of the tumor was recommended, it was refused by the patient. Therefore, careful observation was continued as an out-patient until May 1979 when she noticed a temporal hemianopsia of her left eye. She was admitted and had partial removal of the tumor via frontal route and subsequent irradiation (total dose of 5,000 rad by Lineac). The tumor was verified to be a prolactinoma by the immunohistochemical staining. Postoperative course was uneventful and she lead a normal life. In Oct. 1981, severe faceache began and she was readmitted. Sella was destructed extensively and CT scan revealed a hugh sellar tumor with multi-directional extrasellar extension which was less enhanced than that of the first study. The serum PRL level was 588 ng/ml and the regrowth of prolactinoma was suspected. High dose bromocriptine (40 mg/day) therapy was started. The serum PRL level rapidly fell to the negligible value, however, shrinkage of the tumor was not observed. On Jan. 20, 1982, suddenly she developed a left hemiparesis and her level of consciousness gradually deteriorated. On Mar. 11, 1982, the second operation was performed and a solid firm tumor in the base of the skull was partially removed. The tumor was histologically verified to be a fibrosarcoma. After the second operation bromocriptine therapy was discontinued, however expected elevation of the serum PRL level was not recognized. She died on Apr. 4, 1982.",Excluded
2583,"A clonogenic survival assay of neural stem cells in rat spinal cord after exposure to ionizing radiation Neural stem cells play an important role in neurogenesis of the adult central nervous system (CNS). Inhibition of neurogenesis has been suggested to be an underlying mechanism of radiation-induced CNS damage. Here we developed an in vivo/ in vitro clonogenic assay to characterize the survival of neural stem cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Cells were isolated from the rat cervical spinal cord and plated as single cell suspensions in defined medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The survival of the proliferating cells was determined by their ability to form neurosphere colonies. The number and size of neurospheres were analyzed quantitatively at day 10, 12, 14 and 16 after plating. Plating cells from 5, 10 and 15 mm of the cervical spinal cord resulted in a linear increase in the number of neurospheres from day 10-16. Compared to the nonirradiated spinal cord, there was a significant decrease in the number and size of neurosphere colonies cultured from a 10-mm length of the rat spinal cord after a single dose of 5 Gy. When dissociated neurospheres derived from a spinal cord that had been irradiated with 5 Gy were allowed to differentiate, the percentages of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as determined by immunocytohistochemistry were not altered compared to those from the nonirradiated spinal cord. Secondary neurospheres could be obtained from cells dissociated from primary neurospheres that had been cultured from the irradiated spinal cord. In conclusion, exposure to ionizing radiation reduces the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells cultured from the rat spinal cord. However, neural stem cells retain their pluripotent and self-renewing properties after irradiation. A neurosphere-based assay may provide a quantitative measure of the clonogenic survival of neural stem cells in the adult CNS after irradiation.",Included

2698,"Acute Effect of Low-Dose Space Radiation on Mouse Retina and Retinal Endothelial Cells There is concern that degradation of vision as a result of space flight may compromise both mission goals and long-term quality of life after space travel. The visual disturbances may be due to a combination of intracerebral pressure changes and exposure to ionizing radiation. The retina and the retinal vasculature play important roles in vision, yet have not been studied extensively in relationship to space travel and space radiation. The goal of the current study was to characterize oxidative damage and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells after whole-body gamma-ray, proton and oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O) ion radiation exposure at 0.1 to 1 Gy. Six-month-old male C57Bl/6J mice were whole-body irradiated with 600 MeV/n <sup>16</sup>O ions (0, 0.1, 0.25, 1 Gy), solar particle event (SPE)-like protons (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy) or <sup>60</sup>Co gamma rays (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 Gy). Eyes were isolated for examining endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and characterization of apoptosis in retina and retinal endothelial cells at two weeks postirradiation. The expression of eNOS was significantly increased in the retina after proton and <sup>16</sup>O ion exposure. <sup>16</sup>O ions induced over twofold increase in eNOS expression compared to proton exposure at two weeks postirradiation ( P < 0.05). TUNEL assays showed dose-dependent increases in apoptosis in the retina after irradiation. Low doses of <sup>16</sup>O ions elicited apoptosis in the mouse retinal endothelial cells with the most robust changes observed after 0.1 Gy irradiation ( P < 0.05) compared to controls. Data also showed that <sup>16</sup>O ions induced a higher frequency of apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells compared to protons ( P < 0.05). In summary, our study revealed that exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the retina. Significant changes in retinal endothelial cells occur at doses as low as 0.1 Gy.

Thus, the neurologic outcome of radiosurgery in brain metastasis (BM) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was reviewed. We analyzed 135 patients with BM of NSCLC who were administered Cyberknife radiosurgery (CKRS) as either initial or salvage therapy. We evaluated local failure (LF), intracranial failure (IF), and neurological death (ND) due to BM. Primary outcome was neurological death-free survival (NDFS). Median follow-up was 16.2 months. Median CKRS dose of 22 Gy was administered to median 2 targets per patient. Among 99 deaths, 14 (14%) were ND. Upfront treatment for BM included CKRS alone in 85 patients (63%), CKRS + TA in 26 patients (19%), and WBRT in 24 patients (18%). No patients or tumor related factors were associated with ND. However, the type of upfront treatment for BM was significantly associated with ND [HR 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.57) for CKRS + TA, HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.19-1.68) for CKRS alone] compared with the WBRT group (P = 0.01). The 2-year NDFS rates for the CKRS + TA, CRKS alone, and WBRT groups were 94%, 87%, and 78%, respectively (P = 0.03). Upfront CKRS showed significantly higher 2-year LF-free survival rate (P < 0.01). IF rate was insignificantly lower in the WBRT group compared with CKRS group (P = 0.38). Upfront CKRS + TA was associated with the best neurological outcome with high NDFS.

3398,"Pion radiation for high grade astrocytoma: results of a randomized study PURPOSE: This study attempted to compare within a randomized study the outcome of pion radiation therapy vs. conventional photon irradiation for the treatment of high-grade astrocytomas.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-four patients were randomized to pion therapy (33-34.5 Gy pi), or conventional photon irradiation (60 Gy). Entry criteria included astrocytoma (modified Kernohan high Grade 3 or Grade 4), age 18-70, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) > or = 50, ability to start irradiation within 30 days of surgery, unifocal tumor, and treatment volume < 850 cc. The high-dose volume in both arms was computed tomography enhancement plus a 2-cm margin. The study was designed with the power to detect a twofold difference between arms.RESULTS: Eighty-one eligible patients were equally balanced for all known prognostic variables. Pion patients started radiation 7 days earlier on average than photon patients, but other treatment-related variables did not differ. There were no significant differences for either early or late radiation toxicity between treatment arms. Actuarial survival analysis shows no differences in terms of time to local recurrence or overall survival where median survival was 10 months in both arms (p = 0.22). The physician-assessed KPS and patient-assessed quality of life (QOL) measurements were generally maintained within 10 percentage points until shortly before tumor recurrence. There was no apparent difference in the serial KPS or QOL scores between treatment arms.CONCLUSION: In contrast to high linear energy transfer (LET) therapy for central nervous system tumors, such as neutron or neon therapy, the safety of pion therapy, which is of intermediate LET, has been reaffirmed.

2721,"CEP-1347 (KT7515), an inhibitor of JNK activation, rescues sympathetic neurons and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells from death evoked by three distinct insults The c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascade appears to play a role in some cases of cell death, including neuronal apoptosis. CEP-1347 (KT7515), an indolocarbazole of the K252a family, blocks this stress signaling cascade and promotes survival. Here, we used CEP-1347 to probe whether neuronal death pathways activated by distinct insults also possess elements in common. Cultured rat sympathetic neurons and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were induced to die by withdrawal of nerve growth factor, exposure to ultraviolet irradiation, or subjection to oxidative stress. In each case, death was prevented by 100-200 nM CEP-1347. Moreover, in each of these death paradigms, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activity in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells was elevated by two- or threefold, and this increase was totally blocked by CEP-1347 at concentrations that promoted survival. In contrast, 200 nM CEP-1347 did not block death due to serum withdrawal from undifferentiated PC12 cells or to activation of Fas in Jurkat T cell cultures, even though in each case c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 activation occurred and was inhibited by CEP-1347. These observations suggest that some but not all death pathways triggered by different insults can include a common mechanistic component, a likely candidate for which is activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascade.",Excluded
2624,"Locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Delivering neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to concurrent chemoradiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): The standard of care for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Patients with large tumors at presentation which are close to dose-limiting structures such as the optic chiasm and brain stem may pose a challenging clinical problem. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) prior to CRT can be used to shrink the tumor and may therefore be a valuable strategy to optimize treatment planning. Studies in Asia have reported favorable outcomes with NC for NPC. The goal of this study was to characterize the patterns of use of NC for NPC at a Canadian center. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of locally advanced NPC patients treated between 2000 and 2013. Patients who received NC with the intention to downsize locally advanced tumors prior to CRT were included. Baseline demographics, chemotherapy, radiation therapy treatments, and follow-up data were obtained from institutional databases and chart review and analyzed with SPSS. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), progression-free survival (PFS), local regional relapse-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival functions. Result(s): Forty-six patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 47 (range 18-75). Eighty percent of patients were male, 74% were of Asian ethnicity, and 87% had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Ninetyfour percent of patients had T3 or T4 tumors; 80% were node positive; 26% stage III, 67% IVA, 4% IVB. NC regimens included cisplatin/gemcitabine 87%, cisplatin/fluorouracil 6%, and cisplatin/etoposide 6%. The total neoadjuvant dose of cisplatin received ranged from 24mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 325 mg/m<sup>2</sup> with a median dose of 160mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The most common dose fractionations prescribed were 70 Gy in 35fractions for 67% of cases and 66 Gy in 33 fractions for 13%. Forty-two of the 46 patients went on to receive CRT, and the total concurrent cisplatin dose delivered was <200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 21 patients (46%) and >200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 25 patients (54%). In multivariate analysis of the 42 patients who received concurrent chemotherapy, the ability to deliver over 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> concurrent chemotherapy with radiation was not impacted by the dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, age, sex, ECOG, or ethnicity. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (0.17-10.6 years). Twenty-three percent of patients had a local recurrence, 13% developed distant metastases, and there were 7 deaths, 6 deaths due to NPC. The 3- year PFS was 67%, LRFS 74%, DMFS 86%, DSS 86%, and OS was 83%. Conclusion(s): NPC patients have been treated with NC at this center with favorable outcomes. Most patients tolerated CRT after NC, and half of patients received 5 or more concurrent cycles. The dose of NC given did not lower the dose concurrent chemotherapy later tolerated.

Using realistic reduced-dose simulation, low-dose VPCT datasets with 144 mAs, 108 mAs, 72 mAs and 36 mAs (80 %, 60 %, 40 % and 20 % of the original levels) were generated, resulting in a total of 100 datasets. Perfusion maps were created and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) measurements were performed. Qualitative analyses were conducted by two blinded readers, who also assessed the presence/absence of ischemic lesions and scored CBV and CBF maps using a modified ASPECTS-score.RESULTS: SNR of all low-dose datasets were significantly lower than those of the original datasets (p < .05). All datasets down to 72 mAs (40 %) yielded sufficient image quality and high sensitivity with excellent inter-observer-agreements, whereas 36 mAs datasets (20 %) yielded poor image quality in 15 % of the cases with lower sensitivity and inter-observer-agreements.CONCLUSION: Low-dose VPCT using decreased tube currents down to 72 mAs (40 % of original radiation dose) produces sufficient perfusion maps for the detection of ischemic brain lesions.KEY POINTS: * Perfusion CT is highly accurate for the detection of ischemic brain lesions * Perfusion CT results in high radiation exposure, therefore low-dose protocols are required * Reduction of tube current down to 72 mAs produces sufficient perfusion maps.",Excluded

The dosimetry to otologic structures has not been routinely analyzed and radiation treatment planning does not currently attempt to specifically avoid the inner ear structures when dosimetry is calculated. Recent studies demonstrate that up to 30% of patients experience sensorineural hearing loss on multimodality therapy with cisplatin and radiation.METHODS: In the current case series, radiation dosimetry to otologic structures was calculated from computed tomogram treatment plans on patients. Fifteen nasopharyngeal, oral cavity, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer patients were analyzed.RESULTS: Between 8% and 102% of the total dose is delivered to the petrous bone/cochlea, with 4 of 15 patients getting more than 50% of the dose to at least one cochlea The mastoid air cells received between 3% and 75% of the total dose, with higher doses being delivered to patients with bulky high neck metastases or nasopharyngeal tumors. The eustachian tubes received between 20% and 102% of the total dose, with 10 of 15 patients receiving more than 50% of the dose to this anatomic site.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the cochlea and eustachian tubes receive significant radiation during treatment, particularly in nasopharyngeal cancer patients.

In this study, in order to validate nuclear data and the neutron transportation performance of the materials related to ADS, we measured the leakage neutron spectra from multiple-slab sample assemblies using 14.8 MeV D-T neutrons. Two types of assemblies comprising A-1 (W+U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) and A-2 (U+C+CH<inf>2</inf>) were both built up gradually starting with the first wall. The measured spectra were compared with those calculated using the Monte Carlo code neutron transport coed (MCNP)-4C. A comparison of the results showed that the experimental leakage neutron spectra for both A-1 or A-2 were reproduced well by the three evaluated nuclear data libraries with discrepancies of less than 15% (A-1) and 12% (A-2), except when below 3 MeV. For 2-cm and 5-cm uranium samples, the CENDL-3.1 calculations exhibited large discrepancies in the energy range of 2-8 MeV and above 13 MeV. Thus, the CENDL-3.1 library for uranium should be reevaluated, especially around this energy range. It was significant that the leakage neuron spectra changed clearly when the latest material layer was added during the building of assemblies A-1 and A-2. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded

Real mobile phone emissions are constantly and unpredictably varying and thus are very different from simulated emissions which employ fixed parameters and no variability. This variability is an important parameter that makes real emissions more bioactive. Living organisms seem to have decreased defense against environmental stressors of high variability. While experimental studies employing simulated EMF-emissions present a strong inconsistency among their results with less than 50% of them reporting effects, studies employing real mobile phone exposures demonstrate an almost 100% consistency in showing adverse effects. This consistency is in agreement with studies showing association with brain tumors, symptoms of unwellness, and declines in animal populations. Average dosimetry in studies with real emissions can be reliable with increased number of field measurements, and variation in experimental outcomes due to exposure variability becomes less significant with increased number of experimental replications. We conclude that, in order for experimental findings to reflect reality, it is crucially important that exposures be performed by commercially available mobile phone handsets.

3411,"Patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells transfer mitochondria through tunneling nanotubes in tumor organoids Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain cancer and its relapse after surgery, chemo and radiotherapy appears to be led by GBM stem cells (GSCs). Also, tumor networking and intercellular communication play a major role in driving GBM therapy-resistance. Tunneling Nanotubes (TNTs), thin membranous open-ended channels connecting distant cells, have been observed in several types of cancer, where they emerge to drive a more malignant phenotype. Here, we investigated whether GBM cells are capable to intercommunicate by TNTs. Two GBM stem-like cells (GSLCs) were obtained from the external and infiltrative zone of one GBM from one patient. We show, for the first time, that both GSLCs, grown in classical 2D culture and in 3D-tumor organoids, formed functional TNTs which allowed mitochondria transfer. In the organoid model, recapitulative of several tumor's features, we observed the formation of a network between cells constituted of both Tumor Microtubes (TMs), previously observed in vivo, and TNTs. In addition, the two GSLCs exhibited different responses to irradiation in terms of TNT induction and mitochondria transfer, although the correlation with the disease progression and therapy-resistance needs to be further addressed. Thus, TNT-based communication is active in different GSLCs derived from the external tumoral areas associated to GBM relapse, and we propose that they participate together with TMs in tumor networking.",Excluded
2897,"Ophthalmologic aspects of treating optic neuropathy during the course of Graves-Basedow disease. [Polish] The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of conservative treatment of optic neuropathy in the course of Graves' disease. Nineteen patients with neuropathy out of 520 patients with Graves' disease, including 15 women and 4 men were treated. Age of the patients ranged from 36 to 69 years, mean age was 51.3. In all patients thyroid function was normalized, 4 patients underwent strumectomy. Bi- and unilateral neuropathy was found in 13 and 6 cases respectively. The therapy consisted of high-dose steroids (Prednisone in 12 cases or Dexamethasone i.v. in 3 cases) or they were combined with gamma cobalt-60 irradiation of orbit tissues (2000 c Gy in 10 fractions) in 8 cases. In 2 cases radiotherapy alone was performed. Two cases were excluded from treatment because of optic atrophy during the first examination. In all patients full ophthalmological investigation, ultrasonography and computed tomography of the orbit before and after the treatment were performed. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 46 months, mean 21.4. Improvement of visual acuity and perimetry (p < 0.05) after the treatment was observed and changes of the fundus after the treatment were significantly (p = 0.000) improved. Exophthalmos significantly decreased (p < 0.05) but only in the right eye. In all patients the therapy reduced the ophthalmopathy index from mean 7.5 to 4.1 (p = 0.000). In conclusion: 1. Early diagnosis and appropriate, constant conservative treatment of optic neuropathy in Graves' disease prevent from blindness and surgical intervention. 2. Corticotherapy in combination with radiotherapy of the orbit is a beneficial method of the treatment of optic neuropathy in Graves' disease.",Excluded
2783,"A preliminary comparative treatment planning study for radiotherapy of age-related maculopathy PURPOSE: We present a comparative planning of different approaches for external radiotherapy in age-related maculopathies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calculated dose distributions and dose-volume histograms for (a) bilateral irradiation with 6 MV photons, (b) a single lateral-oblique beam using either photons, electrons or protons and (c) an anterior circular proton beam.RESULTS: For lateral photon or electron beams the dose to the lens is usually lower than 10% of the dose to the macula. The entrance doses for bilateral photon beams are about 50% which increase up to 100% at the orbital bone. About 5 mm of optic nerves are irradiated at the maximal dose while the optic chiasma is spared. A single photon beam gives 50% of the dose to the fellow eye. The electron beam spares the fellow eye but gives a rather inhomogeneous dose to the target volume. For a lateral proton beam, 4 mm of optic nerve receives 90% of the dose, the skin dose is at least 70% of the dose to the macula and the lens and the fellow eye are spared. An anterior proton beam gives 90% of the dose to 1 mm of optic nerve and the 50% isodose approaches the periphery of the lens.CONCLUSION: Doses to the critical structures can be dramatically diminished for all the techniques by reducing the beam size, but only if very precise set-up techniques are used. Proton beams are an attractive solution, but the impact of such a choice on the use of proton facilities and on the national health system should be carefully evaluated, as well as the risk of radio-induced secondary neoplasias.",Excluded

2462,"Near infrared fluorescent imaging of brain tumor with IR780 dye incorporated phospholipid nanoparticles BACKGROUND: Near-IR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging is becoming a promising approach in preclinical tumor detection and clinical image-guided oncological surgery. While heptamethine cyanine dye IR780 has excellent tumor targeting and imaging potential, its hydrophobic property limits its clinical use. In this study, we developed nanoparticle formulations to facilitate the use of IR780 for fluorescent imaging of malignant brain tumor.METHODS: Self-assembled IR780-liposomes and IR780-phospholipid micelles were prepared and their NIRF properties were characterized. The intracellular accumulation of IR780-nanoparticles in glioma cells were determined using confocal microscopy. The in vivo brain tumor targeting and NIRF imaging capacity of IR780-nanoparticles were evaluated using U87MG glioma ectopic and orthotopic xenograft models and a spontaneous glioma mouse model driven by RAS/RTK activation.RESULTS: The loading of IR780 into liposomes or phospholipid micelles was efficient. The particle diameter of IR780-liposomes and IR780-phospholipid micelles were 95 and 26 nm, respectively. While stock solutions of each preparation were maintained at ready-to-use condition, the IR780-phospholipid micelles were more stable. In tissue culture cells, IR780-nanoparticles prepared by either method accumulated in mitochondria, however, in animals the IR780-phospholipid micelles showed enhanced intra-tumoral accumulation in U87MG ectopic tumors. Moreover, IR780-phospholipid micelles also showed preferred intracranial tumor accumulation and potent NIRF signal intensity in glioma orthotopic models at a real-time, non-invasive manner.CONCLUSION: The IR780-phospholipid micelles demonstrated tumor-specific NIRF imaging capacity in glioma preclinical mouse models, providing great potential for clinical imaging and image-guided surgery of brain tumors.",Excluded
3435,"The Mayo Clinic gamma knife experience: indications and initial results OBJECTIVE: To review the results and expectations of contemporary stereotactic radiosurgery.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,033 consecutive patients who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester between January 1990 and January 1998.RESULTS: The number of patients undergoing radiosurgery increased from 57 in 1990 to 216 in 1997. Of 97 patients with arteriovenous malformations who underwent follow-up angiography 2 years or more after a single radiosurgical procedure, 72 (74%) had complete obliteration of the vascular malformation. Of 209 patients who underwent radiosurgery for benign tumors (schwannomas, meningiomas, or pituitary adenomas) and had radiologic studies after 2 years or more of follow-up, tumor growth control was noted in 200 (96%). Tumor growth was also controlled in 90% of brain metastatic lesions at a median of 7 months after radiosurgery. Of 20 patients with trigeminal neuralgia and follow-up for more than 2 months, 14 (70%) were free of pain after radiosurgery.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a safe and effective management strategy for a wide variety of intracranial disorders. Use of radiosurgical treatment should continue to increase as more data become available on the long-term results of this procedure.",Excluded
3588,"A novel specific application of pyruvate protects the mouse retina against white light damage: differential stabilization of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha PURPOSE: To mimic hypoxia preconditioning by a novel specific pyruvate treatment and to study its retinal protection against white light damage.METHODS: Six-to-eight-week-old BALB/c mice were exposed to strong white light calculated to produce photoreceptor degeneration. Some were given injections of pyruvate in a preordained protocol because evidence exists that proves pyruvate can affect the concentration of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to determine the concentration of proteins and mRNAs in retinas. Morphology was analyzed with toluidine blue staining and was plotted using a spidergraph. A free nucleosome cell death assay was used to examine apoptosis. Retina explant cultures were used to investigate the background mechanism.RESULTS: Pyruvate administration stabilized hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha. Expression of the downstream genes hemoxygenase-1 and erythropoietin mirrored the changes of the two HIFs, respectively. Importantly, pyruvate given not only before but also after exposure to light protected photoreceptors against apoptosis. In the retinal explant system, addition or depletion of pyruvate caused only changes of HIF-1alpha and prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)-2, while HIF-2alpha and PHD1 were not affected. However, under hypoxic conditions, HIF-2alpha was stabilized by pyruvate but not HIF-1alpha.CONCLUSIONS: Pyruvate evoked a hypoxia-like response under normoxic conditions and was retina-protective against strong white light. This response included stabilization of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha. This differential stabilization might be related to the distinct preference of their degrading enzyme of PHD2 and PHD1 in response to pyruvate treatment.",Excluded
2916,"Hyperthermia improves Cetuximab accumulation in pancreatic cancer mouse model Objective: Histopathological characteristics of pancreatic carcinoma are the presence of abundant stroma that prevent mAb diffusion and consequently hampers mAb from direct attacking cancer cells. With a strong conviction that additional tool that improve mAb penetration and diffusion in dense fibroblastic solid cancer should indispensable for better therapeutic effect, we focused and employed the simple but strongest modalities, heat. Heat might increase tumor blood flow and tumor vessel permeability, leading enhanced accumulation of anticancer mAb. In this study, we aimed the increased accumulation of mAb in mouse pancreatic subcutaneous models and also boosted antitumor effects by applying moderate heat. Method(s): Heat generation was completed by hot bathtub method for subcutaneous tumor in nude mice leg. Three human pancreatic cell of different stromal amount were employed (abundant: Capan-1, moderate: BxPC-3, and scant: MIAPaCa-2). At the timing of each tumors growth up to 70mm<sup>3</sup>, Cetuximab (1 mg/kg) was systematically administrated via caudal vein, subsequently applying heat to tumors for 30 min at three different temperatures of 25degreeC (control temperature), 37degreeC (intraabdominal organs), or 41degreeC (hyperthermia) (n = 5 each). The amount of accumulated Cetuximab were quantified by the fluorescent intensity of Alexa 488 against anti-human IgG at 24 hr, followed by figuring up the intensity of one cancer cell by dividing the total intensity value by the number of a cancer cell nuclei stained with DAPI. Enhanced antitumor effects, among irradiating various heat doses, were evaluated by the tumor volume over time. Result(s): In Capan-1, the fluorescent intensity per a cancer cell at 25degreeC, 37degreeC, 41degreeC were 675, 1130, 2332 respectively. Similarly, those in BxPC-3 were 673, 1347, 1573, and in MIAPaCa-2 were 1632, 1921, 1949, respectively. In Capan-1 and BxPC-3, the mean tumor growth on day 40 were significantly inhibited at 37degreeC group (934, 189 mm<sup>3</sup>), and 41degreeC group (491, 121 mm<sup>3</sup>) in compared with 25degreeC group (1385, 470 mm<sup>3</sup>) respectively. In MIAPaCa-2, however, that on day 50 was not inhibited at 37 degrees group (109 mm<sup>3</sup>), and 41 group (151 mm<sup>3</sup>) as compared with 25 group (123 mm<sup>3</sup>). Discussion(s): We demonstrated that hyperthermia actually contributed to measurable add-on antitumor effect for two among three pancreatic cancer models. Intending to provide more add-on effect, we are now evaluating the combined effects of hyperthermia plus applying a cyclic tumor-penetrating peptide (iRGD), which improved anticancer mAb penetration to cancer cells by binding to integrin alphav/beta3 or beta5 and to neuropillin-1 on cancer cells. We suggested that this novel combined strategy would remarkably contribute to the enhanced accumulation of anticancer mAb in tumors and to the enhanced antitumor effects.",Excluded
3489,"A histology-based atlas of the C57BL/6J mouse brain deformably registered to in vivo MRI for localized radiation and surgical targeting The C57BL/6J laboratory mouse is commonly used in neurobiological research. Digital atlases of the C57BL/6J brain have been used for visualization, genetic phenotyping and morphometry, but currently lack the ability to accurately calculate deviations between individual mice. We developed a fully three-dimensional digital atlas of the C57BL/6J brain based on the histology atlas of Paxinos and Franklin (2001 The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates 2nd edn (San Diego, CA: Academic)). The atlas uses triangular meshes to represent the various structures. The atlas structures can be overlaid and deformed to individual mouse MR images. For this study, we selected 18 structures from the histological atlas. Average atlases can be created for any group of mice of interest by calculating the mean three-dimensional positions of corresponding individual mesh vertices. As a validation of the atlas' accuracy, we performed deformable registration of the lateral ventricles to 13 MR brain scans of mice in three age groups: 5, 8 and 9 weeks old. Lateral ventricle structures from individual mice were compared to the corresponding average structures and the original histology structures. We found that the average structures created using our method more accurately represent individual anatomy than histology-based atlases alone, with mean vertex deviations of 0.044 mm versus 0.082 mm for the left lateral ventricle and 0.045 mm versus 0.068 mm for the right lateral ventricle. Our atlas representation gives direct spatial deviations for structures of interest. Our results indicate that MR-deformable histology-based atlases represent an accurate method to obtain accurate morphometric measurements of a population of mice, and that this method may be applied to phenotyping experiments in the future as well as precision targeting of surgical procedures or radiation treatment. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Excluded
2495,"Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery for multiple brain metastases Introduction Due to the neurocognitive side effects of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is being used with increasing frequency. The use of SRS is expanding for patients with multiple (>4) brain metastases (BM). This study summarizes our institutional experience with single-fraction, linear-accelerator-based SRS for multiple BM. Methods and materials All patients who were treated between January 1, 2013, and September 30, 2015, with single-fraction SRS for >=4 BM were included in this institutional review board-approved, retrospective, single-institution study. Patients were treated with linear accelerator-based image guided SRS. Results A total of 59 patients with >=4 BM were treated with single-fraction SRS. The median follow-up was 15.2 months, and the median overall survival for the entire cohort was 5.8 months. The median number of treated lesions per patient was 5 (range, 4-23). Per patient, the median planning target volume (PTV) was 4.8 cc (range, 0.7-28.8 cc). The prescribed dose across all 380 BM for the 59 patients ranged from 7 to 20 Gy. The median of the mean dose to the total PTV was 19.5 Gy. Although the number of treated lesions (4-5 vs >=6) did not influence survival, better survival was noted for a total PTV <10 cc versus >=10 cc (7.1 vs 4.2 months, respectively; P =.0001). A mean dose of >=19 Gy to the entire PTV was also associated with increased survival (6.6 vs 5.0 months, respectively; P =.0172). Patients receiving a dose of >12 Gy to >=10 cc of normal brain had worse survival (5.1 vs 8.6 months, respectively; P =.0028). Conclusion In single-fraction SRS for patients with multiple BM, smaller total tumor volume, higher total dose, and lower volume of normal brain receiving >12 Gy were associated with increased survival. These data suggest that using SRS for the treatment of multiple BM is efficacious and that outcomes may be affected more by total tumor volume than by the number of lesions.

Apoptosis was assessed using the annexin V binding assay, proliferation by the methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and MMP-2 secretion with zymography. The levels of phosphorylated (pEGFR) were estimated using a commercially available ELISA kit.RESULTS: Cell proliferation decreased in a dose-dependent manner, while apoptosis was increased after radiation. Doses below 2 Gy did not affect proliferation or apoptosis. MMP-2 levels were increased 48 h after radiation in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, EGFR signaling was significantly activated 15 min after radiation in a dose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Ionizing radiation activates EGFR signalling and enhances MMP-2 secretion, suggesting that the molecular pathways involved may contribute to the invasiveness and malignant behaviour of glioma cells and help to explain the response of gliomas to ionizing radiation.",Excluded
3096,"[The place of radiosurgery in the treatment of hypophyseal adenoma] Since 1984, the neurosurgical team of Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris has taken in charge almost 750 patients for linear accelerator radiosurgery. But only a small percentage of them were harbouring a pituitary tumor. That is why the present paper is based mostly on literature data. Pituitary adenoma radiosurgery (RS) is a second intention therapeutic method. It should be recommended only after failure of medical and/or surgical treatment. Two main methods can be used: linear accelerator-radiosurgery and Cobalt-60 gamma unit. Both procedures provide equivalent results in terms of dosimetry, accuracy and clinical data. Results of various series presented in recent and updated literature have been studied and analysed. They show and confirm the efficiency of radiosurgery on tumor and hormone secretion controls, with few cases of pituitary insufficiency. However, results were disappointing concerning visual disorders, particularly if visual dysfunction and impairment existed before radiosurgery. All authors agree nowadays on different points: a) indications: invasive adenomas, with an incomplete resection, or adenomatous recurrences, b) contraindications: tumoral size > 20 mm, distance to visual pathways < 5 mm, c) imperative precautionary measures: less than 8 Gray must be delivered on visual pathways, less than 40 Gray on oculomotor nerves. In some cases, stereotactic fractioned radiotherapy may be an alternative treatment for large tumors close to visual pathways. [References: 21]",Excluded
2449,"Accelerated recovery of consciousness after general anesthesia is associated with increased functional brain connectivity in the high-gamma bandwidth Recent data from our laboratory demonstrate that high-frequency gamma connectivity across the cortex is present during consciousness and depressed during unconsciousness. However, these data were derived fromstatic and well-defined states of arousal rather than during transitions that would suggest functional relevance. We also recently found that subanesthetic ketamine administered during isoflurane anesthesia accelerates recovery upon discontinuation of the primary anesthetic and increases gamma power during emergence. In the current study we re-analyzed electroencephalogram (EEG) data to test the hypothesis that functional cortical connectivity between anterior and posterior cortical regions would be increased during accelerated recovery induced by ketamine when compared to saline-treated controls. Rodents were instrumented with intracranial EEG electrodes and general anesthesia was induced with isoflurane anesthesia. After 37.5 min of continuous isoflurane anesthesia, a subanesthetic dose of ketamine (25 mg/kg intraperitoneal) was administered, with evidence of a 44% reduction in emergence time. In this study, we analyzed gamma and theta coherence (measure of undirected functional connectivity) and normalized symbolic transfer entropy (measure of directed functional connectivity) between frontal and parietal cortices during various levels of consciousness, with a focus on emergence from isoflurane anesthesia. During accelerated emergence in the ketamine-treated group, there was increased frontal-parietal coherence {p = 0.005, 0.05-0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI)]} and normalized symbolic transfer entropy [frontal to parietal: p < 0.001, 0.010-0.026 (95% CI); parietal to frontal: p < 0.001, 0.009-0.025 (95% CI)] in high-frequency gamma bandwidth as compared with the saline-treated group. Surrogates of cortical information exchange in high-frequency gamma are increased in association with accelerated recovery from anesthesia. This finding adds evidence suggesting a functional significance of high-gamma information transfer in consciousness. Copyright © 2017 Li, Hambrecht-Wiedbusch and Mashour.",Excluded

Only few patients did not harbor extracranial metastases. Systemic therapy after diagnosis of brain metastases has been used in only three patients. Surgical resection and/or radiosurgery have been administered in 34% of patients, but whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) alone remained the cornerstone. Median survival was 4.1 months (3.7 months in the WBRT alone group, 10.1 months in the surgery and/or radiosurgery group). Two factors were significantly associated with better survival: solitary brain metastasis and age <=64 years. The prognostic impact of the recursive partitioning analysis classes was not confirmed, while the new graded prognostic assessment index performed better.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection and/or radiosurgery contribute to prolonged survival. As most patients harbor extracranial metastases that threaten their lives, systemic treatment theoretically might play a role in the management of these patients, but more data need to be collected to confirm the clinical impact of immunotherapy, angiogenesis inhibition, and other signal transduction inhibitor approaches.",Excluded
2483,"Improvement of dexterity by single session low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralesional motor cortex in acute stroke: a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial PURPOSE: Increasing evidence suggests that the contralesional motor cortex (M1) inhibits the ipsilesional M1 in stroke patients. This inhibition could impair motor function of the affected hand. We investigated if inhibitory 1~Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the contralesional M1 improved motor performance of the affected hand in acute stroke.METHODS: A double-blind study of real versus placebo rTMS was conducted. Twelve patients early after subcortical stroke (mean: 7 days) received 1200 stimuli of real and placebo rTMS in a crossover design. The sequence of stimulations was counterbalanced across subjects. Stimulus intensity was subthreshold (90% of motor threshold at rest). Motor function was tested by grip strength recordings and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) executions before and after each rTMS session.RESULTS: Compared to sham stimulation, real rTMS improved NHPT results but not grip strength in the affected hand. No change of performance was observed for the unaffected hand. NHPT baseline repetitions in a subgroup of patients indicated stable motor performance prior to the rTMS sessions.CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that therapeutic rTMS applications over the contralesional hemisphere are feasible in acute stroke patients and can transiently improve dexterity of the affected hand.

Calculation of rCBF was performed using the 2-weighted integral (WI) and autoradiographic methods for the 1-compartment analysis, and the 3-WI method was followed for the 2-compartment analysis. Arterial blood radioactivity was counted continuously and corrected for delay and dispersion. The rCBF images were transformed into the Talairach space and analyzed by statistical parametric mapping to identify regional differences in the 2 methods. The values obtained from regions of interest also were compared.RESULTS: Although the difference in global CBF between the 2 models was not significant, rCBF values in the large arteries and neighbor areas were significantly greater in the 2-WI method than in the 3-WI method. However, regional differences in the activation studies were not affected when the 2 methods were compared. The images of cerebral arterial blood volume (V(0)) obtained by the 3-WI method showed a significant increase in V(0) in the visual cortex during visual stimulation.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the rCBF values in the 1-compartment analysis were affected by radioactivity in the vessels. The 3-WI method could provide rCBF values that are less influenced by vascular radioactivity and also show differences in V(0) in PET activation studies.",Excluded
3209,"Low level laser therapy alters satellite glial cell expression and reverses nociceptive behavior in rats with neuropathic pain BACKGROUND: Nerve injury often results in persistent or chronic neuropathic pain characterized by spontaneous burning pain accompanied by allodynia and hyperalgesia. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is a noninvasive method that has proved to be clinically effective in reducing pain sensitivity and consequently in improving the quality of life. Here we examined the effects of LLLT on pain sensitivity induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats. CCI was performed on adult male rats, subjected thereafter to 10 sessions of LLLT, every other day, and starting 14 days after CCI. Over the treatment period, the animals were evaluated for nociception using behavioral tests, such as allodynia, thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. Following the sessions, we observed the involvement of satellite glial cells in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence approaches. In addition we analyzed the expression levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1beta) and fractalkine (FKN) after the same stimulus.RESULTS: LLLT induced an early reduction (starting at the second session; p <= 0.001) of the mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia in CCI rats, which persisted until the last session. Regarding cellular changes, we observed a decrease of GFAP (50%; p <= 0.001) expression after LLLT in the ipsilateral DRG when compared with the naive group. We also observed a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines after CCI, whereas LLLT dramatically inhibited the overexpression of these proteins.CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that LLLT reverses CCI-induced behavioral hypersensitivity, reduces glial cell activation in the DRG and decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines; we suggest that this involvement of glial cells can be one potential mechanism in such an effect.",Excluded
3586,"The relationship between mood symptoms and neuropsychological function in breast cancer survivors Objective: Breast cancer survivors show neuropsychological deficits in domains such as language and memory that are suspected to be a result of the harmful effects of cancer treatments. Mood symptoms may exacerbate these problems, however, little is known about the exact relationship between these variables. Participants and Methods: We examined a group of 87 breast cancer survivors, mean age 58.7 years, who had received diagnoses of breast cancer 2-22 years prior (mean 6.1 years). Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests that assessed intellectual function, executive function, and memory, and several self-report questionnaires that assessed mood, fatigue, and quality of life. Result(s): Pearson analyses demonstrated significant negative correlations between scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer & Brown, 1996) and the Full Scale IQ,VerbalComprehension Index, and Processing Speed Index scores of theWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III(Wechsler, 1997). BDI-II scores also showed significant negative correlations with some measures of executive function, but not with measures of memory. Analysis of variance showed that breast cancer survivors who had been treated with chemotherapy reported more symptoms of depression than individuals who had not been treated with chemotherapy, F = 9.51, p = .003. A similar pattern was not found for individuals who had been treated with radiation. Patients' history of chemotherapy and radiation treatment did not show any relationship to subsequent neuropsychological function. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that elevated mood symptoms may be related to problems in some domains of neuropsychological performance in breast cancer survivors. Individuals who had received chemotherapy appeared more likely to experience subsequent mood problems. Further investigation is needed to determine if mood changes may increase susceptibility to the cognitive deficits experienced by breast cancer survivors. Acknowledgement: Study funded by Susan G.

2979,"Responses of perivascular macrophages to circulating lipopolysaccharides in the subfornical organ with special reference to endotoxin tolerance BACKGROUND: Circulating endotoxins including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) cause brain responses such as fever and decrease of food and water intake, while pre-injection of endotoxins attenuates these responses. This phenomenon is called endotoxin tolerance, but the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. The subfornical organ (SFO) rapidly produces proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in response to peripherally injected LPS, and repeated LPS injection attenuates IL-1beta production in the SFO, indicating that the SFO is involved in endotoxin tolerance. The purpose of this study is to investigate features of the IL-1beta source cells in the SFO of LPS-non-tolerant and LPS-tolerant mice.METHODS: We first established the endotoxin-tolerant mouse model by injecting LPS into adult male mice (C57BL/6J). Immunohistochemistry was performed to characterize IL-1beta-expressing cells, which were perivascular macrophages in the SFO. We depleted perivascular macrophages using clodronate liposomes to confirm the contribution of IL-1beta production. To assess the effect of LPS pre-injection on perivascular macrophages, we transferred bone marrow-derived cells obtained from male mice (C57BL/6-Tg (CAG-EGFP)) to male recipient mice (C57BL/6N). Finally, we examined the effect of a second LPS injection on IL-1beta expression in the SFO perivascular macrophages.RESULTS: We report that perivascular macrophages but not parenchymal microglia rapidly produced the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in response to LPS. We found that peripherally injected LPS localized in the SFO perivascular space. Depletion of macrophages by injection of clodronate liposomes attenuated LPS-induced IL-1beta expression in the SFO. When tolerance developed to LPS-induced sickness behavior in mice, the SFO perivascular macrophages ceased producing IL-1beta, although bone marrow-derived perivascular macrophages increased in number in the SFO and peripherally injected LPS reached the SFO perivascular space.CONCLUSIONS: The current data indicate that perivascular macrophages enable the SFO to produce IL-1beta in response to circulating LPS and that its hyporesponsiveness may be the cause of endotoxin tolerance.",Excluded
3316,"The reaction of Helix photosensitive neurons to light and cyclic GMP The effect of light and cyclic nucleotides (cGMP and cAMP) on a group of identified photosensitive neurons in Helix pomatia left parietal ganglion was examined. The onset of light induces in these cells a slow inward current shift associated with decrement of slope conductance. The reversal potential (Erev) of the light induced current (IL) and its changes due to altered extracellular concentration of potassium support the assumption that (IL) is due to suppression of K+ conductance. Elevation of intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP by adding 8-bromo-cGMP into the bathing solution or by injecting the nucleotide into the cell mimics, in all cases, the effect of light: it produces an inward current accompanied by decrement of slope conductance. The effect of elevation of cAMP was inconsistent. The I-V relations of IL and IcGMP follow a similar course and have a common Erev. The assumption that 3',5'-cyclic GMP is increased by light is also supported by comparing the effect of light and the cyclic nucleotide on the action potential. Both light and 8-bromo-cGMP broaden the action potential by increasing the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current.",Excluded
2503,"Short-term hazards of low-dose radioiodine ablation therapy in postsurgical thyroid cancer patients During the last two decades, there has been a trend to use low-dose I-131 ablation therapy in patients with thyroid carcinoma without metastases. However, information regarding the incidence of acute adverse reactions in patients after low-dose radioiodine therapy has not been reported. In this study, the acute radiation effects after low-dose radioiodine ablation therapy in postsurgical differentiated thyroid cancer patients was evaluated. Fifty-six patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were prospectively evaluated. None of these patients had evidence of a distant metastasis. All patients received 40 mCi (1480 MBq) I-131 MIBG orally and were evaluated for symptoms and signs by a physician on the second and seventh days after therapy. Xerostomia and nausea were the most common complaints with the same incidence rate of 5.35%. Gastralgia occurred at a frequency of 3.57%. Pain in the thyroid bed, tenderness over a parotid gland, submandibular glands, change in taste, and vomiting all were found at a frequency of 1.78%. Maximum reactions generally occurred 24-48 hours after therapy. All the symptoms except for xerostomia resolved completely in most patients within a week. In comparison with high-dose ablation therapy published in the literature, the incidence of radiation reactions in low-dose radioiodine therapy was much lower. It was concluded that in patients without lymph node or distant metastases, low-dose I-131 MIBG therapy may be recommended to avoid the high incidence of local complications after high-dose treatment.",Excluded

PMS is associated with paresthesias and pain in the hips, buttocks and lower part of body, while ultrasound-guided piriformis injections has several advantages compared prevalent and common approaches, such as well-set shape, availability, direct imaging of neurovascular structures and lack of exposing to ionizing radiation Methods: Fifteen patients (5 male and 10 female; average age, 55.6 years; range, 21-75 years) were diagnosed with PMS based on clinical history, electromyography, straight leg raising (SLR) and Pace signs. First the injection of Methyl Prednisone was applied under guidance of a Micromaxx ultrasound machine and using a 5-10 MHz, 38-mm broadband linear probe. For piriformis injection under ultrasonographic guidance, a linear ultrasound probe is positioned with its lateral side medial to the greater trochanter and its medial side lateral to the ischial tuberosity. The sciatic nerve is then followed cephalad until it courses beneath the piriformis. Ultrasound probe is directed parallel to piriformis. Needle is inserted in lateral third of piriformis. The therapeutic effect was assessed before and a month after injection via Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as three groups: improvement, partial improvement, or failure depending on the degree of symptom Results: According to the results, 7 patients (46.6%) showed improvement, 4 (26.6%) showed partial improvement and 4 (26.6%) failed to respond to the initial treatment.

3470,"The effect of a 50 Hz magnetic field on cognitive function in humans OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the power frequency magnetic field of 0.6mT applied to humans has an effect on cognitive function as has been suggested by animal studies. These fields are less than the suggested intervention level in the UK of 1.6mT and are similar to those found close to some domestic appliances.METHOD AND MATERIALS: A randomized three-way cross-over design using a battery of computerized cognitive function tests were used in the presence or absence of a 50Hz or static magnetic field. Sixteen healthy volunteers undertook two training and three test sessions with a 50Hz or static 0.6 mT magnetic field from a set of coils centred on the head.RESULTS: In response to the 50 Hz field, disruptions of accuracy were seen from an attentional task (the ability to correctly recognize words shown 20min previously and the ability to maintain a string of digits in working memory). There was no similar response to comparable levels of static magnetic field.CONCLUSIONS: These tests indicated at least temporary deterioration in attention, and working and secondary memory performance while a 50 Hz field is applied. There were no adverse effects on speed from any of the tasks. It was not possible in this study to be sure if these effects were persistent.",Excluded
3440,"Cone beam computed tomography number errors and consequences for radiotherapy planning: An investigation of correction methods Purpose: The potential of keV cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for guiding adaptive replanning is well-known. There are impediments to this, one being CBCT number accuracy. The purpose of this study was to investigate CBCT number correction methods and the affect of residual inaccuracies on dose deposition. Four different correction strategies were applied to the same patient data to compare performance and the sophistication of correction-method needed for acceptable dose errors. Methods and Materials: Planning CT and CBCT reconstructions were used for 12 patients (6 brain, 3 prostate, and 3 bladder cancer patients). All patients were treated using Elekta linear accelerators and XVI imaging systems. Two of the CBCT number correction methods investigated were based on an algorithm previously proposed by the authors but only previously applied to phantoms. Two further methods, based on an approach previously suggested in the research literature, were also examined. Dose calculations were performed using scans of a ""worst"" subset of patients using the Pinnacle<sup>3</sup> version 9.0 treatment planning system and the patients' clinical plans. Result(s): All mean errors in CBCT number were <50 HU, and all correction methods performed well or adequately in dose calculations. The worst single dose discrepancy identified for any of the examined methods or patients was 3.0%. Mean errors in the doses to treatment volumes or organs at risk were negatively correlated with the mean error in CT number. That is, a mean CT number that was too large, averaged over the entire CBCT volume, implied an underdosing in a volume-of-interest and vice versa. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that (1) the correction of CBCT numbers to within a mean error of 50 HU in the scan volume provides acceptable discrepancies in dose (<3%) and (2) this is achievable with even quite unsophisticated correction methods. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Evaluated were metabolite indices and metabolite ratios. Logistic linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to evaluate PFS6 and OS, respectively. These analyses were adjusted by age and MR scanner field strength (1.5 T or 3 T). Stepwise regression was performed to determine a subset of the most relevant variables.RESULTS: Associated with shorter PFS6 were a decrease in the ratio of N-acetyl aspartate to choline-containing compounds (NAA/Cho) in the region with a Cho-to-NAA index (CNI) >3 at baseline and an increase of the CNI within elevated CNI regions (>2) at F2mo. Patients with higher normalized lipid and lactate at either time point had significantly worse OS. Patients who had larger volumes with abnormal CNI at F2mo had worse PFS6 and OS.CONCLUSIONS: Our study found more 3D MRSI parameters that predicted PFS6 and OS for patients with GBM than did anatomic, diffusion, or perfusion imaging, which were previously evaluated in the same population of patients.",Excluded

3361,"Role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSCs radiation response; regeneration or senescence? Purpose or Objective Secretory function restoration is a challenge for regenerative therapy of radiation-damaged salivary glands. Recently, stem cell therapy has been proposed to allow such a functional regeneration. It has been suggested that glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes survival of mice salivary gland stem cells (mSGSCs). GDNF-treatment in combination with stem cell based regenerative therapy could represent a promising treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and consequential xerostomia. However, the role of GDNF on SGSC survival and proliferation after therapeutic irradiation is still an enigma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GDNF in the modulation of SGSC response to irradiation. Material and Methods Salivary gland organoid derived cells of Gdnf hypermorphic (Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup>) and wild-type mice (Gdnfwt/wt) were irradiated (IR) with gamma-rays at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy. mSGSC survival and stemness were assessed by calculating stem cell surviving fraction measured as post- IR organoid forming potential and population doublings. Flow cytometry was used to determine the CD24<sup>hi</sup>/CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell (SC) population. qPCR and immunofluorescence were used to detect GDNF expression. Six-day-old salivary gland organoids were irradiated with 7 Gy of yrays, IR induced organoids senescence were confirmed by SA-s-Gal and P16 staining. Results Exogenously added GDNF or increase expression of GDNF in hypermorphic mice SGSC induced an increase in secondary organoids formation efficiency when compared to wild-type mice/untreated SG (p<0.05). However, neither endogenous nor exogenous GDNF increased the CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup> stem cell-like population. Organoids IR surviving fraction (OSF) of mSGSCs were similar albeit resulted in larger spheres and an increased cell number in the Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> compared to Gdnfwt/wt group. Indeed, mSGSC of Gdnf<sup>wt/hyper</sup> mice showed high sphere forming efficiency upon replating. Cell cycle distribution of SGSC after irradiation had no difference with or without GDNF. Interestingly, GDNF expression was highly upregulated after irradiation both in vitro (p=0.008) and in vivo (p<0.05) but normalized in vivo after mSGSC transplantation-related regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) expression was strongly related to OSF (r=0.842, p=0.002) and co-localized with GDNF in salivary gland striated ducts. More than 90% IR induced senescence located in striated ducts where GDNF colocalized with senescence marker p16 and SA-s-Gal. Interestingly, senescence cells were detected in organoids after IR. Conclusion GDNF does not protect mSGSCs against irradiation but seems to promote mSGSCs proliferation through the GDNF-RET signaling pathway. Post-transplantation stimulation of GDNF/RET pathway may enhance the regenerative potential of mSGSCs. IR induced upregulation of GDNF may be involved in IR induced senescence.",Included
2571,"Performance and brain electrical activity during prolonged confinement A subset of the AGARD-STRES battery including memory search, unstable tracking, and a combination of both tasks (dual-task), was applied repeatedly to the four chamber crew members before, during, and after the 60-day isolation period of EXEMSI. Five ground control group members served as a control group. A subjective state questionnaire was also included. The results were subjected to a quantitative single-subject analysis. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded to permit correlation of changes in task performance with changes in the physiological state. Evaluation of the EEG focused on spectral parameters of spontaneous EEG waves. No physiological data were collected from the control group. Significant decrements in tracking ability were observed in the chamber crew. The time course of these effects followed a triphasic pattern with initial deterioration, intermediate recovery to pre-isolation baseline scores after the first half of the isolation period, and a second deterioration towards the end. None of the control group subjects displayed such an effect. Memory search (speed and accuracy) was only occasionally impaired during isolation, but the control group displayed a similar pattern of changes. It is suggested that a state of decreased alertness causes tracking deterioration, which leads to a reduced efficiency of sustained cue utilization. The assumption of low alertness was further substantiated by higher fatigue ratings by the chamber crew compared to those of the control group. Analysis of the continuous EEG recordings revealed that only two subjects produced reliable alpha wave activity (8-12 Hz) over Pz and, to a much smaller extent, Fz-theta wave activity (5-7 Hz) during task performance. In both subjects Pz-alpha power decreased consistently under task conditions involving single-task and dual-task tracking. Fz-theta activity was increased more by single-task and dual-task memory search than by single-task tracking. The alpha attenuation appears to be associated with an increasing demand on perceptual cue utilization required by the tracking performance. In one subject marked attenuation of alpha power occurred during the first half of the confinement period, where he also scored the highest fatigue ratings. A striking increase in fronto-central theta activity was observed in the same subject after six weeks of isolation. The change was associated with an efficient rather than a degraded task performance, and a high rating of the item ""concentrated"" and a low rating of the item ""fatigued."" This finding supports the hypothesis that the activation state associated with increased fronto-central theta activity accompanies efficient performance of demanding mental tasks. The usefulness of standardized laboratory tasks as monitoring instruments is demonstrated by the direct comparability with results of studies obtained from other relevant research applications using the same tasks. The feasibility of a self-administered integrated psychophysiological assessment of the individual state was illustrated by the nearly complete collection of data. The large number of individual data collected over the entire period permitted application of quantitative single-subject analysis, allowing reliable determination of changes in the individual state in the course of time. It thus appears that this assessment technique can be adapted for in-flight monitoring of astronauts during prolonged spaceflights. Parallel EEG recording can provide relevant supplementary information for diagnosing the individual activation state associated with task performance. The existence of large individual differences in the generation of task-sensitive EEG rhythms forms an important issue for further studies.",Excluded

NMDAR-independent LTP in the CA1 region is thought to require activity of postsynaptic L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (Cav1.x), but the underlying channel isoform remains unknown. We evaluated the function of the Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel for spatial learning, synaptic plasticity, and triggering of learning-associated biochemical processes using a mouse line with an inactivation of the CACNA1C (Cav1.2) gene in the hippocampus and neocortex (Cav1.2(HCKO)). This model shows (1) a selective loss of protein synthesis-dependent NMDAR-independent Schaffer collateral/CA1 late-phase LTP (L-LTP), (2) a severe impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, and (3) decreased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and reduced cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent transcription in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our results provide strong evidence for a role of L-type Ca2+ channel-dependent, NMDAR-independent hippocampal L-LTP in the formation of spatial memory in the behaving animal and for a function of the MAPK/CREB (CRE-binding protein) signaling cascade in linking Cav1.2 channel-mediated Ca2+ influx to either process.",Excluded

The uptake of systemically administered rhodamine-ferritin complex by capillary endothelial cells (CECs) of the cerebral cortex was dependent on power density and on duration of exposure. At 5 mW/cm2, for example, a 15-min exposure had no effect. Near-complete blockade of uptake resulted when rats were treated before exposure to microwaves with a single dose of colchicine, which inhibits microtubular function.

All patients underwent pretreatment evaluation at the university's Multidisciplinary Lung Cancer Center. Most patients (87%) had complete mediastinoscopy staging, and all were believed to be poor candidates for up-front operation because of bulky extent of disease. The radiotherapy program used conventional, 2-dimensionally planned treatment to 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8- to 2-Gy fraction size. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of etoposide/cisplatin or carboplatin/paclitaxel. Study end points included resectability, pathologic response, local-regional control, survival, and toxicity. An exploratory comparison between pathologic response and long-term survival was performed. An exploratory comparison between older chemotherapy (etoposide/cisplatin) and third-generation chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) was also performed.RESULTS: Of 53 patients, 45 (85%) were deemed surgical candidates after induction therapy. Twenty-two (42% of the initial cohort) patients had a major pathologic response to stage 0, I, or II disease. The 5-year actuarial survival was 31%. Major pathologic response was associated with improved survival (48% vs 24%; P =.027). The overall rate of early death potentially related to therapy in this series was 9%; this mostly occurred in patients who underwent right pneumonectomy. There was no difference in efficacy or mortality between etoposide/cisplatin and radiotherapy versus carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiotherapy, although the latter regimen was associated with less grade 3 or higher acute toxicity necessitating interruption or hospitalization during neoadjuvant treatment (P =.02). In-field local control was achieved in 83% of all patients (90% of the patients who underwent resection). Brain metastases as the first site of treatment failure occurred in 23% of all patients.CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation delivers high resectability, major pathologic response rate, and excellent local-regional control, with encouraging long-term survival considering the patient population studied. Major pathologic response correlates with long-term survival. Neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiotherapy is an appropriate framework on which to add new therapies.",Excluded
2877,"Spine stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma OBJECT Systemic control of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has substantially improved with the development of VEGF, mTOR, and checkpoint inhibitors. The current first-line standard of care is a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate the response to radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong the time to salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy or second-line systemic therapy. As the prevalence of mRCC has increased, the utilization of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment with SRS and TKIs remain largely undefined. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the safety and efficacy of TKIs when delivered concurrently with SRS. The authors hypothesized that first-line TKIs delivered concurrently with SRS significantly increase local control compared with SRS alone or TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing spine SRS for mRCC was conducted. Patients undergoing SRS were divided into 4 cohorts: those receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), and patients who were undergoing SRS with (C) or without (D) concurrent TKI treatment after failure of first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) was also included, consisting of patients with spinal metastases managed with TKIs alone. The primary outcome was 12-month local failure, defined as any in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to determine the independent effect of concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure. RESULTS One hundred patients who underwent 151 spine SRS treatments (232 vertebral levels) were included. At the time of SRS, 46% were receiving concurrent TKI therapy. In each SRS cohort, the median prescription dose was 16 Gy in 1 fraction. Patients in Cohort A had the highest burden of epidural disease (96%, p < 0.01). At 12 months, the cumulative incidence of local failure was 4% in Cohort A, compared with 19%-27% in Cohorts B-D and 57% in Cohort E (p < 0.01). Multivariate competing risks regression demonstrated that concurrent first-line TKI treatment (Cohort A) was independently associated with a local control benefit (HR 0.21, p = 0.04). In contrast, patients treated with TKIs alone (Cohort E) experienced an increased rate of local failure (HR 2.43, p = 0.03). No toxicities of Grade 3 or greater occurred following SRS with concurrent TKI treatment, and the incidence of post-SRS vertebral fracture (overall 21%) and pain flare (overall 17%) were similar across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis for patients with mRCC has significantly improved with TKIs. The present investigation suggests a local control benefit with the addition of concurrent first-line TKI therapy to spine SRS. These results have implications in the oligometastatic setting and support a body of preclinical radiobiological research.",Included

To gain insight into the pathogenesis of GBM we analyzed brains from primates that developed de novo tumors ten years after whole brain radiation. Four animals had clinical and radiological evidence of GBM, and two animals had no evidence of GBM at the time of euthanization. Tumor precursor cells were identified diffusely scattered in the grossly normal white matter of all animals including two monkeys without evidence of GBM by MR-imaging or on autopsy examination. Tumor precursors demonstrated cellular atypia and mitoses, and were negative for tumor-associated markers GFAP, EGFR and p53. The cells were positive for Ki67 and N-CoR, the nuclear corepressor of astroglial differentiation. These results suggest that radiation-induced nuclear damage to neural stem cells or early astrocytic precursor cells can prevent normal differentiation and lead to tumor development. The findings provide insight into the tumorigenesis of de novo GBMs and suggest a new strategy for treatment of these lethal tumors by targeting both inactivation of N-CoR and inhibition of EGFR.",Included

This research was aimed to evaluate the safety and accuracy of the techniques of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion by using a computer-assisted spinal navigation system combined with electromyography monitoring.METHODS: Sixteen patients underwent minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. A computer-assisted spinal navigation system and electromyography were used for guiding pedicle screw placement. The operative duration, blood loss, complications, and fluoroscopic time were recorded. Clinical outcome was assessed by Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index. Radiographic images were obtained to evaluate the accuracy of pedicle screw placement and fusion rates.RESULTS: The Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores were vastly improved postoperatively. A total of 64 pedicle screws were implanted and three were regarded as misplacement by post-operative CT scan. Three screw trajectories were adjusted according to intra-operative stimulus-evoked electromyography monitoring. The average fluoroscopy time in each patient was 31.8 seconds, which equals to 7.9 seconds per pedicle screw. No patients had instrument related neurological complications, infection, implant failure or revision. Successful fusion was found in all patients.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of navigation system and real-time electromyography monitoring can make the minimally invasive operation more safe and accurate while decreasing radiation exposure time of the medical staff and patient and minimizing the chance and the degree of the pedicle screw misplacement.",Excluded

This article presents the results of 123 patients treated for a brain AVM at the Gamma Knife Center ULB-Hopital Erasme. Radiosurgical treatment is proposed following multidisciplinary discussion of the best therapeutic strategy based on specific parameters of the AVM. Gamma Knife irradiation was achieved for an AVM residue after endovascular embolization for 84 % of patients, after microsurgery for 7 % of patients, or after previous radiosurgical irradiation for 6 % of patients. The whole volume of the nidus was irradiated in a single session for all patients. A mean margin dose of 22.3 Gy was delivered to the nidus, which had a mean volume of 3.3 cc. The maximum dose ranged from 30 Gy to 50 Gy (mean 44.1 Gy). All patients were prospectively followed after treatment with serial angio-MR and/or conventional angiography. A retrospective analysis shows complete obliteration of the AVM for 109 patients (89 %) after 6 to 52 months (mean 32 months). For 14 patients the nidus was only partially obliterated from the radiosurgical procedure; for 9 patients a second irradiation was performed with subsequent complete occlusion of the AVM in all cases. So, 118 of 123 patients (96 %) irradiated by Gamma Knife in 1 or 2 sessions were cured. Four patients bled after irradiation and before complete occlusion of the AVM, with neurological deficit for 2 patients. Transient neurological symptoms develop after treatment for 12 patients (10 %), associated with postradic edema treated with corticoids. Permanent neurological worsening occurred in5 patients (4 %). Gamma Knife treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations is a highly efficient and low-risk therapy when used by a multidisciplinary team.",Excluded
3082,"Diminished neuronal activity increases neuron-neuron connectivity underlying silent synapse formation and the rapid conversion of silent to functional synapses Neuronal activity regulates the synaptic strength of neuronal networks. However, it is still unclear how diminished activity changes connection patterns in neuronal circuits. To address this issue, we analyzed neuronal connectivity and relevant mechanisms using hippocampal cultures in which developmental synaptogenesis had occurred. We show that diminution of network activity in mature neuronal circuit promotes reorganization of neuronal circuits via NR2B subunit-containing NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NR2B-NMDARs), which mediate silent synapse formation. Simultaneous double whole-cell recordings revealed that diminishing neuronal circuit activity for 48 h increased the number of synaptically connected neuron pairs with both silent and functional synapses. This increase was accompanied by the specific expression of NR2B-NMDARs at synaptic sites. Analysis of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) showed that the frequency of NMDAR-mediated, but not AMPAR-mediated, mEPSCs increased, indicating that diminished neuronal activity promotes silent synapse formation via the surface delivering NR2B-NMDARs in mature neurons. After activation of neuronal circuit by releasing from TTX blockade (referred as circuit reactivation), the frequency of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs increased instead, and this increase was prevented by ifenprodil. The circuit reactivation also caused an increased colocalization of glutamate receptor 1-specfic and synaptic NR2B-specific puncta. These results indicate that the circuit reactivation converts rapidly silent synapses formed during activity suppression to functional synapses. These data may provide a new example of homeostatic circuit plasticity that entails the modulation of neuron-neuron connectivity by synaptic activity.",Excluded
3500,"Effects of 1800-MHz radiofrequency fields on circadian rhythm of plasma melatonin and testosterone in male rats Radiofrequency fields (RF) at 1800 MHz are known to affect melatonin (MEL) and testosterone in male rats, but it remains to be determined whether RF affected circadian rhythm of these plasma hormones. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 1800-MHz RF at 208 muw/cm2 power density (SAR: 0.5762 W/kg) at different zeitgeber (ZT) periods of the day, including 0 (ZT0), 4 (ZT4), 8 (ZT8), 12 (ZT12), 16 (ZT16), and 20 (ZT20) h. RF exposure was 2 h/d for 32 d. From each rat, the concentrations of plasma MEL and testosterone were determined in plasma after RF exposure and compared with controls. The results confirmed the existence of circadian rhythms in the synthesis of MEL and testosterone, but revealed an inverse relationship in peak phase of these rhythms. These rhythms were disturbed after exposure to RF, with the effect being more pronounced on MEL than testosterone. The most pronounced effect of RF exposure on MEL and testosterone appears to be in rats exposed to RF at ZT 16 and ZT0 h, respectively. Data suggest that regulation of testosterone is controlled by MEL and that MEL is more sensitive to RF exposure.",Excluded
3127,"[Experimental data for administration of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for prevention of radiation myelopathy] BACKGROUND: Current models of radiation myelopathy provide a rationale for growth factor-based prevention strategies. Thus, we tested whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) alone or in combination modulate radiation tolerance of the rat cervical spinal cord.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cervical spinal cord of 68 adult Fisher F344 rats received a total dose of 30-36 Gy, given as a single fraction of 16 Gy followed by a second radiation dose of 14-20 Gy. Continuous intrathecal infusion of bFGF (44 rats) or saline (24 rats) into the cisterna magna was given concomitantly. A further experiment included 14 additional rats which were treated with subcutaneous injection of IGF-1 parallel to irradiation with a total dose of 34 Gy or 36 Gy. 20 rats received combined treatment, i.e. intrathecal infusion of bFGF plus subcutaneous injection of IGF-1, starting 24 hours before irradiation (total dose 33 Gy or 36 Gy) for a total of 4 days. Animals were followed until myelopathy developed or for a maximum of 12 months. Histopathologic examinations were performed post mortem.RESULTS: Treatment with bFGF alone or IGF-1 alone increased the median time to myelopathy significantly. In the 36-Gy group, after combination treatment a comparable prolongation of latency was seen. Moreover, rats treated with 33 Gy and combined bFGF plus IGF-1 showed a significantly reduced risk of myelopathy, too (p = 0.0015, Figures 1 and 2).CONCLUSION: Combination of IGF-1 and bFGF was more potent than single agent treatment. We observed a significantly reduced myelopathy rate at an intermediate radiation dose level and a longer time to myelopathy at a high-dose level. This finding strengthens the evidence that brief therapeutic intervention can decrease radiation-induced neurotoxicity. Further studies will be undertaken to optimize this strategy.",Excluded
3540,"Tolerances on MLC leaf position accuracy for IMRT delivery with a dynamic MLC The objective determination of performance standards for radiation therapy equipment requires, ideally, establishing the quantitative relationship between performance deviations and clinical outcome or some acceptable surrogate. In this simulation study the authors analyzed the dosimetric impact of random (leaf by leaf) and systematic (entire leaf bank) errors in the position of the MLC leaves on seven clinical prostate and seven clinical head and neck IMRT plans delivered using a dynamic MLC. In-house software was developed to incorporate normally distributed errors of up to +/- 2 mm in individual leaf position or systematic errors (+/- 1 and +/- 0.5 mm in all leaves of both leaf banks or +1 mm in one bank only) into the 14 plans, thus simulating treatment delivery using a suboptimally performing MLC. The dosimetric consequences of suboptimal MLC performance were quantified using the equivalent uniform doses (EUDs) of the clinical target volumes and important organs at risk (OARs). The deviation of the EUDs of the selected structures as the performance of the MLC deteriorated was used as the objective surrogate of clinical outcome. Random errors of 2 mm resulted in negligible changes for all structures of interest in both sites. In contrast, systematic errors can lead to potentially significant dosimetric changes that may compromise clinical outcome. If a 2% change in EUD of the target and 2 Gy for the OARs were adopted as acceptable levels of deviation in dose due to MLC effects alone, then systematic errors in leaf position will need to be limited to 0.3 mm. This study provides guidance, based on a dosimetric surrogate of clinical outcome, for the development of one component, leaf position accuracy of performance standards for multileaf collimators.",Excluded

3081,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for benign tumors with symptoms from brainstem compression PURPOSE: This study evaluated the role of radiosurgery in the management of symptomatic patients with brainstem compression from benign basal tumors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Over a 17-year, period 246 patients (202 vestibular schwannomas and 44 meningiomas) with brainstem compression from benign skull-base tumors were managed with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Median tumor volumes were 3.9 cm(3) (range, 0.8-39.0 mL) and 6.6 mL (range, 1.6-25.1 mL) for vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas, respectively. For both tumors, a median marginal dose of 13 Gy was prescribed. Median follow-up of patients was 65 months for vestibular schwannomas and 60 months for meningiomas. Patients were categorized into four groups on the basis of the tumor-brainstem relationship on neuroimaging.RESULTS: Preservation of function was stratified according to grade of brainstem compression. We analyzed the effect of radiosurgery on symptoms of brainstem compression. The tumor control rate was 100 % for meningioma and 97% for vestibular schwannomas (although 5% required an additional procedure such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt). In patients with vestibular schwannoma, serviceable hearing was preserved in 72.0%. Balance improved in 31.9%, remained unchanged in 56.5%, and deteriorated in 11.6% of patients who had imbalance at presentation. Balance improved significantly in patients who had less tumor compression (p = 0.0357) after radiosurgery. Symptoms improved in 43.2% of patients with meningioma.CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is a minimally invasive option for patients with benign basal tumors that indent or distort the brainstem. A high tumor growth control rate and satisfactory rate of neurological preservation and symptom control can be obtained with radiosurgery.",Excluded
3275,"Regulation of the IRF-1 tumour modifier during the response to genotoxic stress involves an ATM-dependent signalling pathway The mechanism by which genotoxic stress induces IRF-1 and the signalling components upstream of this anti-oncogenic transcription factor during the response to DNA damage are not known. We demonstrate that IRF-1 and the tumour suppressor protein p53 are coordinately up-regulated during the response to DNA damage in an ATM-dependent manner. Induction of IRF-1 protein by either ionizing radiation (IR) or etoposide occurs through a concerted mechanism involving increased IRF-1 expression/synthesis and an increase in the half-life of the IRF-1 protein. A striking defect in the induction of both IRF-1 mRNA and IRF-1 protein was observed in ATM deficient cells. Although ATM deficient cells failed to increase IRF-1 in response to genotoxic stress, the induction of IRF-1 in response to viral mimetics remained intact. Re-expression of the ATM kinase in AT cells restored the DNA damage inducibility of IRF-1, whilst the PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibited IRF-1 induction by DNA damage in ATM-positive cells. The data highlight a role for the ATM kinase in orchestrating the coordinated induction and transcriptional cooperation of IRF-1 and p53 to regulate p21 expression. Thus, IRF-1 is controlled by two distinct signalling pathways; a JAK/STAT-signalling pathway in viral infected cells and an ATM-signalling pathway in DNA damaged cells.",Excluded
2578,"Effects of hypokinesia and hypodynamia upon protein turnover in hindlimb muscles of the rat Hypokinesia/hypodynamia was induced in the hindlimb muscles of the rat using a suspension technique. This caused differing degrees of atrophy in different muscles, however, this atrophy was reduced in muscles held in a lengthened position. The greatest degree of wasting was observed in the unstretched soleus, a slow postural muscle, where both Type 1 and Type 2a fibers atrophied to the same degree. However, wasting of the gastrocnemius muscle was associated with a reduction in the size of the Type 2b fibers. In both slow postural and fast phasic hindlimb muscles, atrophy was brought about by a reduction in the rate of protein synthesis in conjunction with an elevation in the rate of protein degradation. When inactive muscles were passively stretched, both protein synthesis and degradation were dramatically elevated. Even periods of stretch of as little as 0.5 h.d-1 were found to significantly decrease atrophy in inactive muscles.",Excluded
3313,"A review of the necessary planning target volume margins for patients receiving radiation to the brain, with the current immobilization devices in use at the hopital regional de sudbury regional hospital regional cancer program The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the current margins of the planning target volumes in brain patients being treated at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program. The gross tumour volume (GTV) is defined in the International Commission for Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU) report 83 (2010) as the gross demonstrable extent and location of the tumour. The clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as the volume of a tissue that contains the GTV and any microscopic tumour spread. The planning target volume (PTV) is defined by the ICRU 83 report (2010) as the margin accounting for both the internal and external uncertainties. With the use of image-guided radiation therapy such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), imaging and positioning has become much more accurate. A CBCT uses a 3D reconstructed volume of the patient's current position before treatment to verify and correct the setup. This is done by comparing it to the planning patient position as seen with the planning CT image and making any adjustments while the patient is on the bed (Pouliot, Bani-Hashemi, Chen, Svatos, Ghelmansarai, Mitschke, 2005). Daily imaging before treatment has allowed for positioning of the patient accurately to match the image taken for planning purposes. This allows the patient to be set up within millimetres of the position they were in for planning. Currently at the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program, daily imaging for patients receiving radiation to the brain is not standard practice, however, some patients are imaged daily by request from the physician. By using the shift data from patients who have received daily imaging, the setup uncertainty for every fraction can be determined and used to determine an appropriate PTV margin for the majority of patients, who are not imaged daily. If the PTV can be reduced for brain patients being treated, less of the normal brain tissue would be irradiated and could have the potential to reduce acute and late neurotoxicity of treatment (McDonald et al., 2011). A retrospective review of patients who have previously received radiation to the brain with daily CBCT imaging will be done to examine the shifts done before treatment to match the CBCT to the planning CT image. The patient population will include patients who received brain radiation and a daily CBCT before treatment since July 2010. The images taken daily before treatment will be retrospectively studied using the Sudbury Regional Cancer Program's electronic charting system (Mosaic). The shift data examined of patients who received daily imaging can be applied to a calculation proposed by van Herk (2004) to determine the PTV margin accounting for setup error. The shift data describes the measurements by which the patient was shifted after daily imaging to match the original planning image. This equation uses the shift data to determine the PTV margin for those patients who do not receive daily imaging. All patient data will be anonymous and will be kept on a locked password protected computer.",Excluded
3017,"Neoadjuvant versus definitive chemoradiation in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus BACKGROUND: Multimodal treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery (nCRT + S) is the treatment of choice for patients with locally advanced or node-positive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (E-SCC). Those who are unsuitable or who decline surgery can be treated with definitive chemoradiation (dCRT). This study compares the oncologic outcome of nCRT + S and dCRT in E-SCC patients.METHODS: Between 2011 and 2017, 95 patients with E-SCC were scheduled for dCRT or nCRT+ S with IMRT at our department. Patients undergoing dCRT received at least 50 Gy and those undergoing nCRT + S received at least 41.4 Gy. All patients received simultaneous chemotherapy with either carboplatin and paclitaxel or cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil. We retrospectively compared baseline characteristics and oncologic outcome including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and site of failure between both treatment groups.RESULTS: Patients undergoing dCRT were less likely to have clinically suspected lymph node metastases (85% vs. 100%, p = 0.019) than patients undergoing nCRT + S and had more proximally located tumors (median distance from dental arch to cranial tumor border 20 cm vs. 26 cm, p < 0.001). After a median follow up of 25.6 months for surviving patients, no significant differences for OS and PFS were noticed comparing nCRT + S and dCRT. However, the rate of local tumor recurrence was significantly higher in patients treated with dCRT than in those treated with nCRT + S (38% vs. 10%, p = 0.002). Within a multivariate Cox regression model, age, tumor location, and tumor grading were the only independent parameters affecting OS and PFS. In addition to that, proximal tumor location was the only parameter independently associated with an increased risk for local treatment failure.CONCLUSION: In E-SCC patients treated with either dCRT or nCRT + S, a higher rate of local tumor recurrence was seen in patients treated with dCRT than in patients treated with nCRT + S. There was at least a trend towards an improved OS and PFS in patients undergoing nCRT + S. However, this should be interpreted with caution, because proximal tumor location was the only parameter independently affecting the risk of local tumor recurrence.",Excluded
3120,"Adoptively transferred CD8+ T lymphocytes provide protection against TMEV-induced demyelinating disease in BALB/c mice On intracerebral infection with the BeAn strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), certain mouse strains develop a chronic demyelinating disease similar both clinically and pathologically to human multiple sclerosis. Other strains remain resistant. We previously established that differential susceptibility to this demyelinating disease exists among BALB/c substrains, with BALB/cAnNCr mice being susceptible while BALB/cByJ mice are resistant. BALB/cByJ mice are rendered susceptible to TMEV-induced demyelination on exposure to low dose gamma-irradiation before TMEV infection. BALB/cAnNCr and irradiated, infected BALB/cByJ animals are protected against TMEV-induced demyelination by the transfer of a splenic population from TMEV-infected BALB/cByJ donors. Resistance to demyelination appears to be mediated by a CD8+ radiosensitive population, which is induced on infection with TMEV and which must act early to establish resistance to TMEV-induced demyelination.",Excluded
2654,"Physiological and pathological observations on rat middle cerebral arteries and human AVM tissue cultures following single high-dose gamma irradiation In vitro isometric myograph and histopathological studies were performed on rat middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) to explore changes in contractile capacity following experimental Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Right MCAs were treated with 25 Gy and 50 Gy at the 50% isodose line, while contralateral vessels received 15 Gy and 20 Gy at the 20% isodose region. Survival period varied from 3 to 18 months. Reduction in contractile capacity of irradiated normal rat MCAs was detected but their lumina remained patent. In another study, we investigated human AVM tissue cultures in order to detect genetic and phenotypic modifications contributing to vessel occlusion after irradiation. In culture, the proliferation index decreased considerably following 15-, 20-, 25- or 50-Gy irradiation at the 5th posttreatment day and remained depressed during the observation period of 14 days. P53, p21Waf-1 and mdm-2 mRNA contents were elevated significantly after irradiation, indicating enhanced apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed vigorous vimentin positivity in the nonirradiated control AVM cultures, which gradually decreased by the time in the irradiated specimens. Smooth muscle alpha-actin positivity was prominent in the irradiated cultivated samples, suggesting transformation of resting fibroblasts onto activated myofibroblastic elements with contractile capacity. This transformation process was confirmed by the appearance of TGF-Beta in the irradiated AVM cell lines also. These data support the hypothesis that one of the contributing factors to AVM shrinkage and obliteration after radiosurgery might be fibrocyte-myofibroblastic cell transformation in the vessel wall.",Included

2529,"Efficacy of simultaneous pericranial and nasoseptal ""double flap"" reconstruction of anterior skull base defects after combined transbasal and endoscopic endonasal approaches Background: The vascularized pedicled pericranial flap (PCF) has been the traditional method of reconstruction of skull base defects after craniofacial resection of malignant anterior skull base (ASB) lesions. However, flap necrosis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks can occur after radiation therapy. The ""double flap"" reconstruction technique was developed to augment the PCF inferiorly by a secondary vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF) that is harvested using an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA), when a combined cranionasal (transbasal EEA) approach is performed. This study examines the rates of postoperative CSF leaks and flap necrosis after a combined PCF and NSF closure of the skull base defect. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective review on nine consecutive patients, who underwent the double flap reconstruction technique after a combined transbasal-EEA approach. Data collected for each patient included demographics, method of tumor resection and repair, complications, tumor recurrence, and follow-up. Result(s): Nine patients who underwent a combined transbasal and (EEA) for resection of anterior skull base tumors with significant intracranial extension followed by reconstruction of the cranial base using the double flap were identified. Four were men and five were women, with a mean age of 49 years (range: 15-68 years). There was no postoperative CSF leakage detected or complications of infection, meningitis, mucocele or tension pneumocephalus after a mean follow-up of 15.1 months (range: 4.6-35.4 months). Eight of the nine patients underwent adjuvant radiation without flap necrosis. Tumor recurrence was not observed in any of the patients at last follow-up.

Fifteen patients with trismus (maximum interincisal opening [MIO] <=35 mm) after oncologic treatment for head and neck cancer, underwent a 10-week exercise program with the TheraBite device and were followed regularly. Time between oncologic treatment and start of TheraBite exercise ranged from 0.7 to 14.8 years (average 6.2 years). MIO, trismus-related symptoms, and HRQL was assessed before and after exercise and after 6 months. A significant improvement in MIO was observed post-exercise (3.5 mm, 15.3%, p = 0.0002) and after 6-month of follow-up (4.7 mm, 22.1%, p = 0.0029). A statistically significant correlation was found between increased MIO and fewer trismus-related symptoms.

Irradiation with ultraviolet light (UV) led to inhibition of spontaneous impulses and after UV-off, an afterinhibition which lasted for a few minutes. This afterinhibition was rapidly overcome by exposure to visible light (VIS). UV-VIS antagonism of this type was identified in six different impulse systems monitored in extracellular recordings. Intracellular recordings from two of the six cell types showed that UV irradiation causes hyperpolarization which inhibits spontaneous activity. The other cell types showed no membrane potential changes during UV irradiation even though the cells' spontaneous outputs were inhibited.

3008,"Re-Irradiation in Recurrent Gliomas: Treatment outcome and Prognostic factors Purpose or Objective: Gliomas have diverse prognoses that differ primarily depending on histologic subtype, grade and molecular marker expression. Even after aggressive multimodal treatment, most gliomas eventually recur. Treatment options for recurrent gliomas include surgery, chemotherapy, and re-irradiation. We sought to review our institutional experience with re-irradiation in the management of recurrent gliomas. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 31 patients with recurrent or progressive gliomas who received re-irradiation between January 2012 and December 2016. Majority (20 patients) constituted High Grade Glioma. (Grade III and IV). Though the recurrence was more in Grade IV Glioma but these patients were not included in our analysis because of their poor performance status and Re-RT was not feasible in them. All the patients were assessed for Re-Surgery. Reirradiation was offered to recurrent glioma patients with good performance status and at least 6 months had passed after initial radiotherapy (RT). All the patients were treated after doing planning CT Scan (Non-Contrast) and MRI of Brain (3 D FSPGR sequence) with I.V contrast and images were fused for target delineation. Target volume was delineation was kept conservative and the mean volume was 80 cc (50 to 140 cc). Technique of Radiotherapy was IMRT/VMAT and fractionation used was conventional. 11 patients were treated with concurrent oral Tab TMZ and 1 patient was treated with Inj Bevacizumab, 2 weekly cycle. Result(s): Out of 31 patients, 11 patients were found to be fit for Re-Surgery but only 8 patients agreed to do so. All the patients received Re-Radiation. Median doses of reirradiation and initial RT were 45.0 Gy and 59.4 Gy, respectively. The median time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation was 18 months. The median PFS and OS after re-irradiation were 3 and 7 months respectively. 12-month OS rate was 40%. 3 patients developed radiation necrosis and needed prolonged steroid therapy. In univariate analysis, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) >=70 (p <0.001), re-irradiation dose >=45 Gy (p =0.040), and longer time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation (p =0.040) were associated with improved OS. In multivariate analysis, KPS (p =0.030) and length of time interval between initial RT and re-irradiation (p=0.048) were important predictors of OS. Use of TMZ did not show any benefit. Molecular markers were not available for most of the patients and hence correlation could not be done. Conclusion(s): Re-irradiation in conjunction with surgery could be a salvage treatment for very selected recurrent glioma patients with good performance status. Re-irradiation was associated with only modest palliative and survival benefits in this retrospective review. Difficulties separating toxicity due to retreatment versus tumor progression and limited patient survival following retreatment preclude definite conclusions. Radiation necrosis was infrequent.

3114,"Investigation of PKC isoform-specific translocation and targeting of the current of the late afterhyperpolarizing potential of myenteric AH neurons AH neurons in the enteric nervous system play an essential role in initiating intestinal reflexes and factors that control AH neuron excitability therefore influence the state of the digestive system. Prominent afterhyperpolarizations that follow action potentials in these neurons strongly affect their excitability. In the present work, we have investigated the regulation of the afterhyperpolarizing current (I(AHP)) by protein kinase C (PKC). Electrophysiological responses and protein translocation were investigated in AH neurons of freshly dissected preparations of myenteric ganglia from the guinea-pig ileum. The activator of conventional and novel PKCs, phorbol dibutyrate, but not the activator of novel PKCs, ingenol, blocked the I(AHP). Phorbol dibutyrate had no effect on the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) or on the A current (I(A)). Stimulation of synaptic inputs to the neurons also reduced the I(AHP), and had no effect on I(h) or I(A). Phorbol dibutyrate also reduced a background outward current that was present after the I(AHP) current had been blocked by clotrimazole. Both phorbol dibutyrate and ingenol caused translocation of the novel PKC, PKCepsilon, in these neurons. Only phorbol dibutyrate caused translocation of PKCgamma, a conventional PKC. The studies thus indicate that the activation of PKC by phorbol esters and by nerve stimulation affects AH neurons in a similar way, and that PKC activation targets both the I(AHP) and another background K(+) current. The I(AHP) is targeted by a conventional PKC, suggested to be PKCgamma, as this is the only conventional PKC that is prominent in AH neurons.",Excluded

Case Description: A 54-year-old woman came to our department for convulsions and was admitted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a giant tumor in the skull base region, including the sphenoid sinus, pituitary fossa, right cavernous sinus, right middle fossa, and right basal ganglia. Mild left hemiparesis was noted. An ophthalmologic examination revealed left side homonymous hemianopsia. Using an endonasal endoscopic surgical approach, tumor removal was performed, with the residual tumor removed with a transcranial approach. Residual tumor tissue remained around the right cavernous sinus; therefore, SRT was performed 1 month after the second procedure, which resulted in good control of growth. Four years later, spontaneous CSF leakage occurred, for which endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed. One month later, CSF leakage recurred, and the same procedure was again used. A third episode of recurrent CSF leakage occurred 5 days later. A transcranial approach was finally used for repair, and the patient showed complete recovery. Conclusion(s): Late-onset CSF leakage after SRT for a pituitary adenoma can be intractable, and several aggressive repair procedures may be needed, including a combination of endonasal and transcranial approaches.

The coils were activated and deactivated at 5 min intervals during the 1 hour exposure period. In both mice and rats, the levels of serotonin in the pineal were markedly increased by the exposure. In rats, an increase of pineal 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid and a decrease of the activity of the pineal enzyme serotonin-N-acetyltransferase also was observed. However, pineal and serum melatonin levels were not altered. The results indicate that the metabolism of serotonin in the pineal is quickly affected by the exposure of animals to a magnetic field.",Excluded

2821,"Mechanisms of postspaceflight orthostatic hypotension: Low alpha <inf>1</inf>-adrenergic receptor responses before flight and central autonomic dysregulation postflight Although all astronauts experience symptoms of orthostatic intolerance after short-duration spaceflight, only ~20% actually experience presyncope during upright posture on landing day. The presyncopal group is characterized by low vascular resistance before and after flight and low norepinephrine release during orthostatic stress on landing day. Our purpose was to determine the mechanisms of the differences between presyncopal and nonpresyncopal groups. We studied 23 astronauts 10 days before launch, on landing day, and 3 days after landing. We measured pressor responses to phenylephrine injections; norepinephrine release with tyramine injections; plasma volumes; resting plasma levels of chromogranin A (a marker of sympathetic nerve terminal release), endothelin, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG, an intracellular metabolite of norepinephrine); and lymphocyte beta<inf>2</inf>-adrenergic receptors. We then measured hemodynamic and neurohumoral responses to upright tilt. Astronauts were separated into two groups according to their ability to complete 10 min of upright tilt on landing day. Compared with astronauts who were not presyncopal on landing day, presyncopal astronauts had 1) significantly smaller pressor responses to phenylephrine both before and after flight; 2) significantly smaller baseline norepinephrine, but significantly greater DHPG levels, on landing day; 3) significantly greater norepinephrine release with tyramine on landing day; and 4) significantly smaller norepinephrine release, but significantly greater epinephrine and arginine vasopressin release, with upright tilt on landing day. These data suggest that the etiology of orthostatic hypotension and presyncope after spaceflight includes low alpha<inf>1</inf>-adrenergic receptor responsiveness before flight and a remodeling of the central nervous system during spaceflight such that sympathetic responses to baroreceptor input become impaired.",Excluded
2670,"Which prognostic index is most appropriate in the setting of delayed stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases? Objectives: To determine if five commonly used prognostic indices (PIs) - recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), Score Index for Radiosurgery (SIR), Basic Score for Brain Metastases (BSBM), graded prognostic assessment (GPA), and the diagnosis-specific GPA - are valid following delay between diagnosis and treatment of brain metastases. Method(s): In a single-institutional cohort, records of patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) more than 30 days from diagnosis of brain metastases were collected, and five PI scores were calculated for each patient. For each PI, three score-based groupings were made to examine survival differences by means of adjusted log-rank analysis and area under the curve (AUC). Result(s): Of 121 patients with sufficient PI information, 72 underwent SRS more than 30 days after diagnosis. Median age and Karnofsky performance status were 60 years and 80, respectively. Forty-three (60%) patients had lung primaries. Prior to SRS, 38 (52.8%) and 12 (16.7%) patients underwent whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and surgery, respectively. Two (2.8%) patients underwent both WBRT and surgery prior to SRS. A median of two lesions were treated per SRS course. Median survival of the cohort was 9.0 months. Using adjusted log-rank analysis for pairwise comparison, BSBM and GPA showed significance between two out of the three prognostic groups, while the other scores showed either one or no significant differences on comparison. AUC demonstrated good applicability for BSBM, RPA, and GPA, although SIR was statistically less prognostic than the other PIs. Conclusion(s): The PIs analyzed in this study were applicable in the setting of delayed SRS. Although these data are hypothesis generating, they serve to encourage further analyses to validate a PI that is most optimal for these patients.

2676,"Space radiation-induced inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and memory impairment in mice: ameliorative potential of the melatonin metabolite, AFMK Evaluation of potential health effects from high energy charged particle radiation exposure during long duration space travel is important for the future of manned missions. Cognitive health of an organism is considered to be maintained by the capacity of hippocampal precursors to proliferate and differentiate. Environmental stressors including irradiation have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and are associated with the onset of cognitive impairments. The present study reports on the protective effects of N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), a melatonin metabolite, against high energy charged particle radiation-induced oxidative damage to the brain. We observed that radiation exposure (2.0 Gy of 500 MeV/nucleon (56)Fe beams, a ground-based model of space radiation) impaired the spatial memory of mice at later intervals without affecting the motor activities. AFMK pretreatment significantly ameliorated these neurobehavioral ailments. Radiation-induced changes in the population of immature and proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus were localized using anti-doublecortin (Dcx) and anti-Ki-67 expression. AFMK pretreatment significantly inhibited the loss of Dcx and Ki-67 positive cells. Moreover, AFMK pretreatment ameliorated the radiation-induced augmentation of protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxyalkenal + malondialdehyde (MDA + HAE) in the brain and maintained the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and nonprotein sulfhydryl contents in brain.",Included

2695,"DNAJB6 is a peptide-binding chaperone which can suppress amyloid fibrillation of polyglutamine peptides at substoichiometric molar ratios Expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches lead to protein aggregation and severe neurodegenerative diseases. A highly efficient suppressor of polyQ aggregation was identified, the DNAJB6, when molecular chaperones from the HSPH, HSPA, and DNAJ families were screened for huntingtin exon 1 aggregation in cells (Hageman et al. in Mol Cell 37(3):355-369, 2010). Furthermore, also aggregation of polyQ peptides expressed in cells was recently found to be efficiently suppressed by co-expression of DNAJB6 (Gillis et al. in J Biol Chem 288:17225-17237, 2013). These suppression effects can be due to an indirect effect of DNAJB6 on other cellular components or to a direct interaction between DNAJB6 and polyQ peptides that may depend on other cellular components. Here, we have purified the DNAJB6 protein to investigate the suppression mechanism. The purified DNAJB6 protein formed large heterogeneous oligomers, in contrast to the more canonical family member DNAJB1 which is dimeric. Purified DNAJB6 protein, at substoichiometric molar ratios, efficiently suppressed fibrillation of polyQ peptides with 45degreeQ in a thioflavin T fibrillation. No suppression was obtained with DNAJB1, but with the closest homologue to DNAJB6, DNAJB8. The suppression effect was independent of HSPA1 and ATP. These data, based on purified proteins and controlled fibrillation in vitro, strongly suggest that the fibrillation suppression is due to a direct protein-protein interaction between the polyQ peptides and DNAJB6 and that the DNAJB6 has unique fibrillation suppression properties lacking in DNAJB1. Together, the data obtained in cells and in vitro support the view that DNAJB6 is a peptide-binding chaperone that can interact with polyQ peptides that are incompletely degraded by and released from the proteasome.",Excluded
3545,"In vivo imaging of endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression after radiosurgery in an animal model of arteriovenous malformation Focussed radiosurgery may provide a means of inducing molecular changes on the luminal surface of diseased endothelium to allow targeted delivery of novel therapeutic compounds. We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation to induce surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo, to assess their suitability as vascular targets in irradiated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Cultured brain microvascular EC were irradiated by linear accelerator at single doses of 0, 5, 15 or 25 Gy and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 measured by qRT-PCR, Western, ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging using Xenolight 750-conjugated ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 antibodies examined luminal biodistribution over 84 days in a rat AVM model after Gamma Knife surgery at a single 15 Gy dose. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were minimally expressed on untreated EC in vitro. Doses of 15 and 25 Gy stimulated expression equally; 5 Gy was not different from the unirradiated. In vivo, normal vessels did not bind or retain the fluorescent probes, however binding was significant in AVM vessels. No additive increases in probe binding were found in response to radiosurgery at a dose of 15 Gy. In summary, radiation induces adhesion molecule expression in vitro but elevated baseline levels in AVM vessels precludes further induction in vivo. These molecules may be suitable targets in irradiated vessels without hemodynamic derangement, but not AVMs. These findings demonstrate the importance of using flow-modulated, pre-clinical animal models for validating candidate proteins for vascular targeting in irradiated AVMs.",Included
3000,"Human mesenchymal stem cells home specifically to radiation-injured tissues in a non-obese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model The therapeutic potential of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) has recently been brought into the spotlights of many fields of research. One possible application of the approach is the repair of tissue injuries related to side effects of radiotherapy. The first challenge in cell therapy is to assess the quality of the cell and the ability to retain their differentiation potential during the expansion process. Efficient delivery to the sites of intended action is also necessary. We addressed both challenges using hMSC cultured and then infused to non-obese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice submitted to total body irradiation. Furthermore, we tested the impact of additional abdominal irradiation superimposed to total body irradiation (TBI), as a model of local therapeutic irradiation. Our results showed that the hMSC used for transplant have been expanded without significant loss in their differentiation capacities. After transplantation into adult unconditioned mice, hMSC not only migrate in bone marrow but also into other tissues. Total body irradiation increased hMSC implantation in bone marrow and muscle and further led to engraftment in brain, heart and liver. Local irradiation in addition to TBI, increased homing of injected cells to the injured tissues and to other tissues outside the local irradiation field. Morphological recovery of irradiated tissues after MSC transplantation and/or differentiation of MSC into specific organ cell types needs to be investigated. This study suggests that using the potential of hMSC to home to various organs in response to tissue injuries might be a strategy to repair the radiation-induced damages.",Excluded
3014,"Pre-and post-bevacizumab glioblastoma histopathology, biomarkers and imaging: An autopsy study Anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab is frequently used to treat recurrent glioblastomas (GBMs). Imaging after bevacizumab therapy to evaluate therapeutic response and/or progression is complicated by biologic alterations that may preclude detection of viable tumor by routine MRI methods. Preliminary data using an innovative and advanced diffusionweighted imaging technique developed at UC San Diego, restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), suggest that RSI provides a more robust marker of tumor cellularity relative to standard diffusion-weighted imaging. Previously published studies by others have demonstrated that bevacizumab- treated GBMs have altered imaging findings and relapse as tumors with a conspicuous perivascular invasive phenotype. This phenotype is also replicated by murine models of anti-angiogenic therapy. A biomarker study of four cases of paired pretreatment GBMs and post-bevacizumab autopsy brain tissue that was matched to RSI tumor zones was performed to better characterize the invasive tumor phenotype in response to bevacizumab. Patients were 56-66 years (mean: 61) at the time of diagnosis. Survival time from diagnosis to death ranged from 9 to 24 months (mean: 16). All patients received standard radiation and temozolamide, followed by bevacizumab. Histology of pre-treatment tumors was variable without a conspicuous perivascular invasive phenotype. RSI on post-bevacizumab therapy showed areas of high signal intensity consistent with tumor progression. Similar areas sampled at the time of autopsy revealed a conspicuous perivascular tumor phenotype. Intense PTEN immunoreactivity in tumor microvasculature was present in all pre-treatment tissues, but was absent after treatment. Both EGFR (internal domain) and pMAPK were unchanged by treatment. EGFRvIII immunoreactivity was more variable between pre- and posttreatment specimens. Overall, RSI could detect tumors after bevacizumab therapy characterized by conspicuous zones of perivascular tumor cells with alterations in biomarkers.",Excluded
2513,"Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound for unilateral thalamotomy in medication refractory essential tremor Introduction: Essential Tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and is associated with significant functional impairment and disability. Ablative and stimulation-based surgical treatments have been developed to treat the significant number of patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical management. Although often providing effective tremor control, current surgical options have risks associated with intracranial procedures, as well as issues of durability and predictability of treatment response. Here, we explore the application of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) as an alternative, non-invasive means of generating thalamic lesions in patients with treatment-resistant ET. Method(s): Four patients underwent awake MRgFUS thalamotomy for refractory essential tremor (mean age 70.8; mean duration of illness 17.8 years). Diagnosis of refractory ET was confirmed by a movement disorder neurologist, and patients underwent baseline medical and imaging investigations prior to treatment. Tremor assessments and serial structural imaging were performed at 1, 7, 30 and 90 days following the procedure. Result(s): All four patients experienced immediate and sustained improvements in their dominant (treated) hand tremor (Figure 1). At 1- and 3-months following treatment, dominant hand tremor scores were reduced by a mean of 89% and 78%, respectively, on part A of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. Functional impairment decreased significantly at 3-months, with patients reporting improvements in writing, drinking and eating. There were no serious adverse events, with only one patient reporting persistent lip and finger paraesthesias at 3-months. Conclusion(s): MRgFUS appears to be a safe and effective means of non-invasively generating thalamic lesions for the relief of refractory ET. This technology is a promising alternative to radiation- and surgical-based approaches to lesional functional neurosurgery, but requires larger trials with more patients to verify its efficacy.

2911,"Synthesis of copper octabromotetracarboranylphenylporphyrin for boron neutron capture therapy and its toxicity and biodistribution in tumour-bearing mice Copper tetracarboranyltetraphenylporphyrin (CuTCPH) is a minimally toxic carborane-containing porphyrin that has safely delivered high concentrations of boron for experimental boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Copper octabromotetracarboranylphenylporphyrin (CuTCPBr), synthesized by bromination of CuTCPH, is one of several new minimally toxic analogues of CuTCPH being studied in our laboratory, which could possess comparable or better tumour-targeting properties with enhanced tumour cytotoxicity. Its biodistribution, biokinetics and toxicity in mice with subcutaneous EMT-6 (mammary) or SCCVII (squamous cell) carcinomas were compared with those of CuTCPH. The administration of approximately 200 mg kg(-1) of either porphyrin in six intraperitoneal injections over 2 days had no apparent effect, but administration of approximately 400 mg kg(-1) slightly lowered body weights, elevated alanine and aspartate transaminase activities in blood plasma, and depressed blood platelet counts for several days. Enzymes and platelets returned to normal within 5 days after those injections and body weights returned to normal within 2 weeks. High average concentrations of boron from either porphyrin were achieved in the two tumour models from a total dose of approximately 200 mg kg(-1). The high tumour boron concentration decreased slowly while concentrations in blood decreased rapidly. Boron concentrations in brain and skin were consistently lower than in tumour by a factor of 10 or more.

2941,"Prospective study of fatigue in localized prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy The objectives were to (1) prospectively evaluate fatigue utilizing validated instruments in patients with localized prostate cancer, and (2) examine the relationships between fatigue, depression, quality of life, and sleep disturbance. The instruments used included: Piper Fatigue Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate Scale. Data on cancer stage, prostate specific antigen levels, hematocrit, patient's body weight and radiation dosage were recorded. Patients were evaluated preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy, and at 4-5 weeks follow-up. Thirty-six veterans with localized prostate cancer were studied. Mean age was 66.9 years (range 55-79). Duration of treatment was 7-8 weeks. Univariate procedure and Wilcoxon Signed Rank-test were used to examine changes in pretreatment scores for each of the three subsequent study periods. To adjust for multiple comparisons Bonferroni test was used. Spearman Correlations were calculated among parameters. No significant changes were noted in mean scores of hematocrit and body weight during the study period. On the Piper Fatigue Scale, adjusted for multiple comparisons, the median scores were significantly higher at completion of radiotherapy as compared with preradiotherapy values. Three patients (8%) were experienced fatigue according to Piper Fatigue Scale before treatment as compared to nine patients (25%) at completion of radiotherapy. On Prostate Cancer Specific and Physical Well Being subscales of the Functional Assessment for Prostate Cancer Therapy, the scores were significantly lower at middle and completion of radiotherapy than at pretreatment. At preradiotherapy, middle of radiotherapy, completion of radiotherapy and follow-up evaluation, patients scoring higher on the Piper Fatigue Scale were more likely to report a poorer quality of Physical Well Being on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostates. No significant changes were noted in the Beck Depression Inventory and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores during treatment. Eight patients scored 10 or more on the Beck Depression Inventory before starting radiotherapy, suggesting depressive symptomatology. Of these, only seven patients scored 10 or more at completion of treatment. The incidence of fatigue is lower in our study than in previously published data. A relationship exists between fatigue scores and physical well being subscale scores. Higher scores on the Piper Fatigue Scale at the completion of radiotherapy, as well as no changes on depression and sleepiness scales, suggest that fatigue may not be the result of depression or sleep disturbance. Based upon our previous work, we propose that the physical expression of fatigue may be secondary to a decline in neuromuscular efficiency and enhanced muscle fatigue.",Excluded
3058,"Initial clinical experience of a prototype ultra-high-resolution CT for assessment of small intracranial arteries Purpose: Diagnostic and neurosurgical procedures require the precise localization of small intracranial arteries, but this may be difficult using conventional computed tomography angiography (CTA). This study was conducted to evaluate the quality of CTA images acquired using a prototype ultra-high-resolution computed tomography (U-HRCT) system compared with those acquired using a conventional computed tomography (C-CT) system. Material(s) and Method(s): From July through September 2015, 10 adult patients (6 women and 4 men) previously scanned by C-CT were examined using U-HRCT to locate and assess cerebral aneurysms. The bilateral ophthalmic artery (Opth A), anterior choroidal artery (Acho A), and thalamoperforating arteries (TPAs) were visually evaluated in randomly presented CTA images. Images were graded on a 5-point scale, and differences in scores between U-HRCT and C-CT were evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Visual evaluation scores for images of the Opth A, Acho A, and TPAs were significantly higher for U-HRCT than for C-CT. U-HRCT images achieved good visualization (score > 3) for C-CT images with poor visualization (score < 3) in 66.7-100% of all the small arteries. Conclusion(s): U-HRCT is superior to C-CT for detecting and evaluating clinically significant small intracranial arteries. Copyright © 2019, Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded
2915,"Activation of ATM and phosphorylation of p53 by heat shock p53 protein is phosphorylated in response to various stresses. Here we examined phosphorylation of p53 protein in normal human diploid cells after heat shock at 43 degrees C for 2 h. We found that heat shock stimulates phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 but not at Ser20, while X-irradiation at 4 Gy and 10 J/m(2) of UV induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and less significantly at Ser20. Increased phosphorylation of Ser15 was also observed in heat shocked GM638, the SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell line. Although X-ray irradiation induced phosphorylation of Ser6, 9, 20, and 37 in GM638 cells, heat shock did not affect the phosphorylation level of these serines. We observed little or no phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 in two primary ataxia telangiectasia fibroblast cells, that are defective in ATM. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we confirmed that immunoprecipitated ATM from both heat-shocked and X-irradiated normal human diploid cells can phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 to a similar extent. These results indicate that heat shock induces phosphorylation of p53, especially at Ser15, and its phosphorylation is mediated by ATM kinase.",Excluded
3072,"Coordinated regulation of circadian rhythms and homeostasis by the suprachiasmatic nucleus We have demonstrated that in rats activities of various enzymes related to gluconeogenesis and amino acid metabolism show circadian rhythms. Based on these results, we have explored the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian oscillation and phase response to light of the master clock located in the dorsomedial subdivision of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and found various proteins closely related to phase response such as BIT/SHPS-1 and those of circadian oscillation, some of which are involved in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation.On the other hand, we have presented several lines of evidence that the ventrolateral subdivision of the SCN includes not only the control center of energy supply to the brain, but also that of homeostasis such as blood glucose, blood pressure, water balance, and body temperature. We have also shown that besides these functions, the latter subdivision is involved in the regulations of hormone secretions such as insulin, glucagon, corticosterone and vasopressin. It has been also shown by electrophysiological means that light exposure to rat eye enhances sympathetic nerve activity, whereas it depresses parasympathetic nerve activity. Thus, environmental light is implicated not only in the phase-shift through the retinohypthalamic tract (RHT), but also control of autonomic nerve activities through the RHT, It is also discussed in this review how the two divisions are interconnected and how environmental light is involved in this interconnection.

Five healthy volunteers underwent whole-body combined PET-computed tomography 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 hours after tracer injection (mean dose, 9.5 mCi +/- 3.4 [standard deviation] [351.5 MBq +/- 125.8]; mean specific radioactivity, 1200 mCi/mmol +/- 714 [44.4 GBq/mmol +/- 26.4]). During this time, standard vital signs, electrocardiographic (ECG) readings, and blood sample values (for chemistry, hematologic, and liver function tests) were checked at regular intervals and 1 and 7 days after the injection. These data were used to evaluate tracer biodistribution and dosimetric properties, time-activity curves, and the stability of laboratory values. Significant changes in vital signs and laboratory values were evaluated by using a combination of population-averaged generalized estimating equation regression and exact paired Wilcoxon tests.RESULTS: The administration of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was well tolerated, with no marked effects on vital signs, ECG readings, or laboratory values. The tracer showed the same pattern of biodistribution in all volunteers: primary clearance through the kidneys (0.360 rem/mCi +/- 0.185 [0.098 mSv/MBq +/- 0.050]) and bladder (0.862 rem/mCi +/- 0.436 [0.233 mSv/MBq +/- 0.118], voiding model) and uptake in the spleen (0.250 rem/mCi +/- 0.168 [0.068 mSv/MBq +/- 0.046]) and large intestine (0.529 rem/mCi +/- 0.236 [0.143 mSv/MBq +/- 0.064]). The mean effective dose of (18)F-FPPRGD2 was 0.1462 rem/mCi +/- 0.0669 (0.0396 mSv/MBq +/- 0.0181). With an injected dose of 10 mCi (370 MBq) and a 1-hour voiding interval, a patient would be exposed to an effective radiation dose of 1.5 rem (15 mSv). Above the diaphragm, there was minimal uptake in the brain ventricles, salivary glands, and thyroid gland. Time-activity curves showed rapid clearance from the vasculature, with a mean 26% +/- 17 of the tracer remaining in the circulation at 30 minutes and most of the activity occurring in the plasma relative to cells (mean whole blood-plasma ratio, 0.799 +/- 0.096).CONCLUSION: (18)F-FPPRGD2 has desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties. The primary application is likely to be PET evaluation of oncologic patients-especially those with brain, breast, or lung cancer. Specific indications may include tumor staging, identifying patients who would benefit from antiangiogenesis therapy, and separating treatment responders from nonresponders early.",Excluded
2441,"Radiosurgical treatment for epilepsy associated with cavernomas Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital vascular malformations of the brain, which often present with drug-resistant epilepsy. Microsurgical excision remains the preferred approach for cortical-subcortical epileptogenic CMs that are not located in functional cortex. For patients presenting with seizures arising from eloquent cortex surrounding the lesion, radiosurgery appears to be a suitable alternative. We evaluated the effectiveness of Gamma Knife (GK) surgery in the management of drug-resistant seizures associated with CMs in a retrospective multicenter study. Forty-nine patients with cortical or subcortical CMs with severe long-term drug-resistant epilepsy underwent radiosurgery. The mean duration of epilepsy before these GK procedures was 7.5 (+/-9.3) years. The mean frequency of seizures was 6.9/month (+/-14). The mean marginal radiation dose was 19.17 Gy. At the last follow-up examination, 53% were seizure free. A highly significant decrease in the number of seizures was achieved for another 20%. The remaining 26% of patients showed little or no improvement. The morbidity was low. Radiosurgery is a promising management modality for epilepsy associated with CMs. The determination of the extent of the epileptogenic zone in CMs and dose selection are the critical steps towards successful radiosurgical outcome.

3007,"Sparing of cochleae and eyes in whole brain radiation therapy with boost by helical tomotherapy and noncoplanar VMAT Purpose/Objective: Simple low conformity lateral opposing radiation beams with limited sparing to proximal organs-atrisk (OARs) were widely adopted in the past for treating palliative whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Crucial OARs located at skull base used to sacrifice with significant radiation dose inevitably. More conformal radiation treatments, like helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), are becoming more accepted to treat WBRT. These techniques allow not only conformal dose to the whole brain but also simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) doses to dedicated metastases for superior disease control and symptom relief. This study aimed to investigate any potential advantages in cochleae and eyes sparing between HT and non-coplanar VMAT. Material(s) and Method(s): Treatment planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 15 brain metastasis patients who had received palliative dose WBRTs with SIBs to the metastases in the department were recruited. Each patient was re-planned with HT and non-coplanar VMAT for dosimetric comparison. Departmental routine optimal settings with fan beam thickness of 2.5cm and pitch value of 0.287 were used in all HT plans. One coplanar full arc plus two non-coplanar half arcs modulating by Varian Millennium 120 MLCs were used in all VMAT plans. The two non-coplanar half arcs were arranged at 60 degrees offset to each other and to the coplanar full arc to cover the cranial hemisphere. All target volumes were optimized according to original prescriptions. The median whole brain dose was 30Gy (range 25-40Gy) and the median SIB dose was 35Gy (range 30-45Gy). The mean SIB volume was 26.7+/-30.4cc consisting 1.7+/-1.8% of the whole brain volume 1481.8+/-161.1cc. Radiation doses to cochleae and eyes were studied by comparing their maximum doses (Dmax) and mean doses (Dmean). The dose results from the two techniques were tested statistically by paired t-test considering significant level of p-value <0.05. Result(s): The dose results are listed in Table 1. Non-coplanar VMAT significantly achieved lower Dmax and Dmean to both cochleae than HT (all p<0.001). Radiation doses to both eyes were slightly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT but could not be shown statistically significant (all p>0.05). However, the Dmax and Dmean to both lens were significantly higher in non-coplanar VMAT than in HT (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion(s): Non-coplanar VMAT is superior to HT in sparing cochleae which are relatively small and highly proximal to target volumes. There is no significant dose difference in eyes sparing for both techniques. Non-coplanar VMAT is preferred to treat WBRT with SIB if slight increase in lens doses is not a concern.

2814,"Evaluating DNA damage in rodent brain after acute 60 Hz magnetic-field exposure In recent years, numerous studies have reported a weak association between 60 Hz magnetic-field exposure and the incidence of certain cancers. To date, no mechanism to explain these findings has been identified. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether acute magnetic-field exposure could elicit DNA damage within brain cells from both whole brain and cerebellar homogenates from adult rats, adult mice and immature mice. Rodents were exposed to a 60 Hz magnetic field (0, 0.1, 1 or 2 mT) for 2 h. Then, at 0, 2 and 4 h after exposure, animals were killed humanely, their brains were rapidly removed and homogenized, and cells were cast into agarose gels for processing by the alkaline comet assay. Four parameters (tail ratio, tail moment, comet length and tail length) were used to assess DNA damage for each comet. For each species, a significant increase in DNA damage was detected by each of the four parameters in the positive control (2 Gy X rays) relative to the concurrent nonirradiated negative and sham controls. However, none of the four parameters detected a significant increase in DNA damage in brain cell homogenates from any magnetic-field exposure (0- 2 mT) at any time after exposure. The dose-response and time-course data from the multiple animal groups tested in this study provide no evidence of magnetic-field-induced DNA damage.",Excluded
2688,"Interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost: The feasibility and cosmetic outcome of a fractionated outpatient delivery scheme Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, potential toxicity, and cosmetic outcome of fractionated interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost for the management of patients with breast cancer at increased risk for local recurrence.Methods and Materials: From 1994 to 1996, 18 women with early stage breast cancer underwent conventionally fractionated whole breast radiotherapy (50-50.4 Gy) followed by interstitial HDR brachytherapy boost. All were considered to be at high risk for local failure. Seventeen had pathologically confirmed final surgical margins of less than 2 mm or focally positive. Brachytherapy catheter placement and treatment delivery were conducted on an outpatient basis. Preplanning was used to determine optimal catheter positions to enhance dose homogeneity of dose delivery. The total HDR boost dose was 15 Gy delivered in 6 fractions of 2.5 Gy over 3 days. Local control, survival, late toxicities (LENT-SOMA), and cosmetic outcome were recorded in follow-up. In addition, factors potentially influencing cosmesis were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The minimum follow-up is 40 months with a median 50 months. Sixteen patients were alive without disease at last follow-up. There have been no in-breast failures observed. One patient died with brain metastases, and another died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease. Grade 1-2 late toxicities included 39% with hyperpigmentation, 56% with detectable fibrosis, 28% with occasional discomfort, and 11% with visible telangiectasias. Grade 3 toxicity was reported in one patient as persistent discomfort. Sixty-seven percent of patients were considered to have experienced good/excellent cosmetic outcomes. Factors with a direct relationship to adverse cosmetic outcome were extent of surgical defect (p = 0.00001), primary excision volume (p = 0.017), and total excision volume (p = 0.015). Conclusion(s): For high risk patients who may benefit from increased doses, interstitial HDR brachytherapy provides a convenient outpatient method for boosting the lumpectomy cavity following conventional whole breast irradiation without overdosing normal tissues. The fractionation scheme of 15 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 days is well tolerated. The volume of tissue removed from the breast at lumpectomy appears to dominate cosmetic outcome in this group of patients. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
2774,"Radiotherapy management of brain metastases using conventional linear accelerator BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As treatments for primary cancers continue to improve life expectancy, unfortunately, brain metastases also appear to be constantly increasing and life expectancy for patients with brain metastases is low. Longer survival and improved quality of life may be achieved using localised radiological and surgical approaches in addition to low dose corticosteroids. Stereotactic brain radiotherapy is one rapidly evolving localized radiation treatment. This article describes our experience with stereotactic radiotherapy using a linear accelerator.METHODS: We reviewed patients treated with stereotactic radiotherapy, from the time of its introduction into daily practice in our Department of Oncology in 2014. We collected the data on patient treatment and predicted survival based on prognostic indices and actual patient outcome.RESULTS: A total of 10 patients were treated by stereotactic radiotherapy, in one case in combination with whole brain radiotherapy and hippocampal sparing. There was no significant treatment related toxicity during the treatment or follow-up and due to the small number of fractions, the overall tolerance of the treatment was excellent. The patient intrafractional movement in all cases was under 1 mm suggesting that 1 mm margin around the CTV to create the PTV is sufficient and also that patient immobilization using the thermoplastic mask compared with invasive techniques, is feasible. We also found that prognostic indices such as the Graded Prognostic Assessment provide accurate predictions of patient survival.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our current evidence, patients with brain metastases fit enough, should be considered for stereotactic radiotherapy treatment.",Excluded
2528,"OFF response of bullfrog cones is shaped by terminal ionotropic GABA receptors We recently reported an ionotropic GABA receptor expressed at the bullfrog retinal cone terminal that is potentiated by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (BIC) and suppressed by the GABA(C) receptor antagonist imidazole-4-acetic acid (I4AA) . In this study, by using the patch clamp technique in current clamp mode, we show that activation of this GABA receptor causes voltage changes of cones, which are closely dependent on the membrane potential level in relation to the chloride equilibrium potential of the cells. Furthermore, the OFF overshoot of cone light responses is enhanced or diminished when this receptor is potentiated by BIC or suppressed by I4AA, suggesting the involvement of this GABA receptor in shaping OFF light responses of bullfrog cones.",Excluded

2740,"Differential longitudinal decline of white matter integrity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease Objective: To identify imaging biomarkers of disease progression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be used in longitudinal assessments. Background(s): Recent years have witnessed the emergence of treatment trials for FTLD and AD, creating a need for sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. Cross-sectional studies have shown that white matter integrity, measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is affected by both AD and FTLD. Few studies have quantified or compared the rates of change in white matter integrity in these disorders. Method(s): Diffusion weighted 3T MRIs from a cohort of 60 FTLD patients (27 behavioral-variant, 19 semantic-variant, 14 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 19 AD, and 69 healthy controls were acquired at baseline and 1-year on average follow up. Images were processed using a longitudinal DTI pipeline implemented in SPM12 to identify annualized changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). Result(s): Compared to controls, FTLD showed more reduction in FA over 1-year in the corpus callosum (CC), superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate, and anterior portions of the internal capsule and corona radiata. In AD, FA reductions were seen in the splenium and posterior portions of the thalamic radiation. Conclusion(s): Decline in white matter integrity in FTLD and AD is measurable over 1 year and reflects established patterns of brain pathology in these two disorders. This suggests that changes in white matter integrity can provide a viable surrogate marker in both FTLD and AD for future clinical trials. In addition, similar to previous clinical and volumetric studies, white matter is shown to degrade nearly twice as rapidly in FLTD compared to AD.",Excluded

Twenty-one subjects flew aboard a KC-135 aircraft operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) which performed parabolic maneuvers resulting in periods of 0-g, 1-g, and 1.8-g. Each subject flew once with a tablet containing scopolamine and once with a placebo in a random order, crossover design. Signs and symptoms of motion sickness were systematically recorded during each parabola by an investigator who was blind to the content of the tablet. Compared with flights using placebo, flights with buccal scopolamine resulted in significantly lower scores for nausea (31%-35% reduction) and vomiting (50% reduction in number of parabolas with vomiting). Side effects of the drug during flight were negligible. We conclude that buccal scopolamine is more effective than a placebo in treating ongoing motion sickness.",Excluded
2573,"Neck stiffness in a post-irradiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma adult: An unusual diagnosis Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a neoplasm commonly found in population of South East Asia. The mainstay of treatment is high dose irradiation. Complications from radiotherapy are not uncommon especially to those nearby structures such as vertebrae and spinal cord. A 57 year-old gentleman with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who was treated with chemo-radiation (total of 35 fractions,70Gy) presented to us 6 months post therapy with bilateral nasal discharge and progressive neck stiffness. Nasoendoscopy showed inflamed nasophayngeal mucosa and Computed Tomography (CT) brain and cervical spine showed retropharyngeal and anterior epidural collection with extension into atlantoaxial bone and spinal cord compression. Histopathological specimen revealed features of chronic inflammations with multiple actinomycetes colonies. Our patient suffered severe neck stiffness and loss of sensations on both upper limbs. He was treated conservatively with Halo vest and intravenous antibiotics for 8 weeks and recovered fully. Irradiation in NPC is known to cause devastating complications to cervical spine such as osteoradionecrosis, osteomyelitis. It also renders tissues hypoxic and risk of getting rare infection like actinomycosis. This report can represent a great diagnostic and therapeutic challenge with differentials of tumor recurrence, osteoradionecrosis or osteomyelitis.

3459,"[Radiation-induced neuropathies: collateral damage of improved cancer prognosis] INTRODUCTION: Because of the improvement of cancer prognosis, long-term damages of treatments become a medical and public health problem. Among the iatrogenic complications, neurological impairment is crucial to consider since motor disability and pain have a considerable impact on quality of life of long cancer survivors. However, radiation-induced neuropathies have not been the focus of great attention. The objective of this paper is to provide an updated review about the radiation-induced lesions of the peripheral nerve system.STATE OF THE ART: Radiation-induced neuropathies are characterized by their heterogeneity in both symptoms and disease course. Signs and symptoms depend on the affected structures of the peripheral nerve system (nerve roots, nerve plexus or nerve trunks). Early-onset complications are often transient and late complications are usually progressive and associated with a poor prognosis. The most frequent and well known is delayed radiation-induced brachial plexopathy, which may follow breast cancer irradiation. Radiation-induced lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy is characterized by pure or predominant lower motor neuron signs. They can be misdiagnosed, confused with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or with leptomeningeal metastases since nodular MRI enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina and increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content can be observed. In the absence of specific markers of the link with radiotherapy, the diagnosis of post-radiation neuropathy may be difficult. Recently, a posteriori conformal radiotherapy with 3D dosimetric reconstitution has been developed to link a precise anatomical site to unexpected excess irradiation.PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSION: The importance of early diagnosis of radiation-induced neuropathies is underscored by the emergence of new disease-modifying treatments. Although the pathophysiology is not fully understood, it is already possible to target radiation-induced fibrosis but also associated factors such as ischemia, oxidative stress and inflammation. A phase III trial evaluating the association of pentoxifylline, tocopherol and clodronate (PENTOCLO, NCT01291433) in radiation-induced neuropathies is now recruiting.",Excluded
3102,"Uncertainty in assessment of radiation-induced diffusion index changes in individual patients The purpose of this study is to evaluate repeatability coefficients of diffusion tensor indices to assess whether longitudinal changes in diffusion indices were true changes beyond the uncertainty for individual patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT). Twenty-two patients who had low-grade or benign tumors and were treated by partial brain radiation therapy (PBRT) participated in an IRB-approved MRI protocol. The diffusion tensor images in the patients were acquired pre-RT, week 3 during RT, at the end of RT, and 1, 6, and 18 months after RT. As a measure of uncertainty, repeatability coefficients (RC) of diffusion indices in the segmented cingulum, corpus callosum, and fornix were estimated by using test-retest diffusion tensor datasets from the National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) database. The upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated RC from the test and retest data were used to evaluate whether the longitudinal percentage changes in diffusion indices in the segmented structures in the individual patients were beyond the uncertainty and thus could be considered as true radiation-induced changes. Diffusion indices in different white matter structures showed different uncertainty ranges. The estimated RC for fractional anisotropy (FA) ranged from 5.3% to 9.6%, for mean diffusivity (MD) from 2.2% to 6.8%, for axial diffusivity (AD) from 2.4% to 5.5%, and for radial diffusivity (RD) from 2.9% to 9.7%. Overall, 23% of the patients treated by RT had FA changes, 44% had MD changes, 50% had AD changes, and 50% had RD changes beyond the uncertainty ranges. In the fornix, 85.7% and 100% of the patients showed changes beyond the uncertainty range at 6 and 18 months after RT, demonstrating that radiation has a pronounced late effect on the fornix compared to other segmented structures. It is critical to determine reliability of a change observed in an individual patient for clinical decision making. Assessments of the repeatability and confidence interval of diffusion tensor measurements in white matter structures allow us to determine the true longitudinal change in individual patients.",Excluded
2731,"Influence of a complex magnetic field application in rats upon thermal nociceptive thresholds: the importance of polarity and timing The application of a weak (1 microTesla) complex magnetic field pattern with a relevant electrophysiological signature produced an analgesic response in rats to thermal stimuli when the pattern was presented once every 4 sec for 30 min through iron-core solenoids. In one experiment, the burst-firing pattern was presented once every 4 s for 30 min and restricted to the positive polarity, negative polarity or a bipolar equivalent. The strongest analgesia occurred when the burst-firing pattern was presented with positive polarity or as the typical bipolar signal. Administrations of the burst-firing pattern once per week for four consecutive weeks produced analgesia that was clearly evident during the first, third, and fourth weeks but not during the second week of treatment. A telephone sensor coil (that can be readily obtained from local electronic shops) was then used instead of the solenoids along with an audio (.wav) file to generate the magnetic field; the analgesia was still apparent. However, when the magnetic pattern was generated from a compact disc source the analgesia was not evoked. The current results suggest that these fields can be generated through simple commercial devices controlled by available computer software.",Excluded

Thirty-six patients received Gd-DTPA enhanced study during the course of MR evaluation and six of the patients showed enhancing radiation necrosis. Histopathological confirmations were obtained in three patients. Gd-DTPA enhancing radiation lesions were multiple and patchy in three patients, multiple and patchy with cyst formation in two and ring shaped in one. In terms of their distribution, enhancing lesions in four patients were seen only in the white matter within the irradiated field and these patients had undergone radiotherapy within five years. The interval after radiotherapy was more than eight years in two patients and their enhanced lesions were observed in both the white and gray matter. Histopathological findings of Gd-DTPA enhancing radiation necrosis were gliosis and coalescing vacuoles of the neural tissue. None of these enhanced radiation lesions showed significant mass effects. Patterns of the enhancement were not specific. It was considered to be difficult to differentiate tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis with conventional Gd-DTPA enhanced MR examinations. In one patient, delayed MR images after Gd-DTPA administration showed increases in the size and number of radiation enhanced lesions. Dynamic and delayed MR study might add more information to conventional imaging after Gd-DTPA. Further studies are necessary to differentiate radiation lesions from tumor recurrences.",Excluded

Low-dose (high-dose-rate) X-irradiation inhibits FSTinduced immobility in mice due to its antioxidative function. We evaluated the effects of low-dose gamma-irradiation at a low-dose-rate on the FST-induced depletion of antioxidants in mouse organs. Mice received whole-body low-dose-rate (0.6 or 3.0 mGy/h) of low-dose gamma-irradiation for 1 week, followed by daily FSTs (5 days). The immobility rate on day 2 compared to day 1 was significantly lower in the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice than in sham irradiated mice. The FST significantly decreased the catalase (CAT) activity and total glutathione (t-GSH) content in the brain and kidney, respectively. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and t-GSH content in the liver of the 3.0 mGy/h irradiated mice were significantly lower than those of the non-FST-treated mice. The CAT activity in the lungs of mice exposed to 3.0 mGy/h gamma-irradiation was higher than that of non-FST treated mice and mice treated with FST. However, no significant differences were observed in the levels of these antioxidant markers between the sham and irradiated groups except for the CAT activity in lungs. These findings suggest that the effects of low-dose-rate and low-dose gamma-irradiation on FST are highly organ-dependent.",Included

2629,"Fluid shift induced alterations of the optic nerve head and peripapillary choroid assessed using optical coherence tomography Purpose: More than 50% of International Space Station astronauts demonstrate visual acuity decrements or ocular structural changes during or after spaceflight. The leading hypothesis explaining spaceflight-induced vision impairment is that a cephalad fluid shift leads to altered tissue volume and pressure relationships in the eye and orbit. We hypothesize that reducing venous outflow from the dependent limbs with a venoconstrictive thigh cuff will temporarily reverse or attenuate ocular and cerebral volume changes observed during 15degree head-down tilt (HDT). Method(s): Twenty normal subjects (12M, 8F) were studied following a 10 min stabilization period, seated, supine, HDT, and HDT with commercially-available thigh cuffs (CUFF) inflated to 60 mm Hg. We quantified Bruch's membrane to lamina cribrosa (LC) depth in 13 subjects and peripapillary choroidal thickness (PPC) in 19 subjects from enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography images. Average PPC was quantified from 1.5 to 3 mm from the center of the ONH along radial B-scans at clock hours 12, 3, 6, and 9. The optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and internal jugular vein cross-sectional area (IJVA) were measured using ultrasound. Mixed-effects linear regression model with repeated measures was used to test for significant PPC, LC, IJVA, and ONSD changes. All data are presented as mean +/- standard error. Result(s): Compared to seated (377+/-28 mum) or with CUFF (363+/-28 mum), LC depth significantly (P<0.01) increased in the supine (395+/-28 mum) and HDT (384+/-28 mum) positions. PPC at clock hour 9 significantly (P<0.01) increased from seated (198+/-16 mum) to HDT (208+/-16 mum), however CUFF was not significantly different from HDT. In addition, PPC at clock hours 12 and 6 were significantly different between the seated and HDT conditions. IJVA and ONSD increased from the seated (IJVA: 0.15+/-0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> and ONSD: 0.533+/-0.012 cm) to HDT (IJVA: 1.03+/-0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> and ONSD: 0.581 +/-0.012 cm) posture (P<0.001) but were not affected by CUFF. Conclusion(s): Moving from the seated to HDT posture alters LC depth and PPC. These results suggest that HDT, a microgravity analog results in an acute cephalad fluid shift that significantly alters posterior optic nerve head structure. Application of bilateral thigh cuffs inflated to 60 mm Hg for 10 minutes was not sufficient to reverse all these changes to levels measured during the seated posture.",Excluded
3442,"Gene expression in rat vestibular and reticular structures during and after space flight Space flight produces profound changes of neuronal activity in the mammalian vestibular and reticular systems, affecting postural and motor functions. These changes are compensated over time by plastic alterations in the brain. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful indicators of both activity changes and neuronal plasticity. We studied the expression of two IEG protein products [Fos and Fos-related antigens (FRAs)] with different cell persistence times (hours and days, respectively) to identify brainstem vestibular and reticular structures involved in adaptation to microgravity and readaptation to 1 G (gravity) during the NASA Neurolab Mission (STS-90). IEG protein expression in flight animals was compared to that of ground controls using Fisher 344 rats killed 1 and 12 days after launch and 1 and 14 days after landing. An increase in the number of Fos-protein-positive cells in vestibular (especially medial and spinal) regions was observed 1 day after launch and 1 day after landing. Fos-positive cell numbers were no different from controls 12 days after launch or 14 days after landing. No G-related changes in IEG expression were observed in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pattern of FRA protein expression was generally similar to that of Fos, except at 1 day after landing, when FRA-expressing cells were observed throughout the whole spinal vestibular nucleus, but only in the caudal part of the medial vestibular nucleus. Fos expression was found throughout the entire medial vestibular nucleus at this time. While both Fos and FRA expression patterns may reflect the increased G force experienced during take-off and landing, the Fos pattern may additionally reflect recent rebound episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep following forced wakefulness, especially after landing. Pontine activity sources producing rhythmic discharges of vestibulo-oculomotor neurons during REM sleep could substitute for labyrinthine signals after exposure to microgravity, contributing to activity-related plastic changes leading to G readaptation. Reticular structures exhibited a contrasting pattern of changes in the numbers of Fos- and FRA-positive cells suggestive of a major influence from proprioceptive inputs, and plastic re-weighting of inputs after landing. Asymmetric induction of Fos and FRAs observed in some vestibular nuclei 1 day after landing suggests that activity asymmetries between bilateral otolith organs, their primary labyrinthine afferents, and vestibular nuclei may become unmasked during flight.",Included

[Japanese] Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck cancers and brain tumors was started in December 2000 at our hospital. Methods of quality assurance (QA) in IMRT at our hospital are reported. IMRT was given by 4 MV X-ray with a dynamic multi-leaf collimator (MLC) method. Treatment planning was obtained by an inverse planning method. It took two days to select an appropriate treatment plan among various plans obtained by inverse planning, and three days to perform dosimetry in phantoms for each beam and the total beams and to determine an isocenter of fields. The measured dose distribution in phantoms were consistent with the calculated dose distribution, although the measured doses were 2-4% lower than the calculated doses. The accuracy of MLC is the most important point in QA of IMRT. Beam profiles were obtained for all beams by a semiconductor profiler before IMRT every day. In addition, position of MLC was checked by a test pattern of a film method once a week. This method is very accurate and the slight deviation of MLC position as small as 0.2 mm could be detected by the method.

3502,"Intracellular analysis of reflex pathways underlying the stumbling corrective reaction during fictive locomotion in the cat In cat and humans, contact between an obstacle and the dorsum of the foot evokes the stumbling corrective reaction (reflex) that lifts the foot to avoid falling. This reflex can also be evoked by short trains of stimuli to the cutaneous superficial peroneal (SP) nerve in decerebrate cats during the flexion phase of fictive locomotion. Here we examine intracellular events in hindlimb motoneurons accompanying stumbling correction. SP stimulation delivered during the flexion phase excites knee flexor motoneurons at short latency [minimum excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) latency 1.8 ms; mean 2.7 ms]. Although a similar short latency excitation occurs in ankle extensors (mean latency, 2.8 ms), recruitment is delayed until successive shocks in the stimulus train overcome the locomotor-related hyperpolarization of ankle extensors. In ankle flexor motoneurons, SP stimulation evokes an inhibition (mean latency, 2.7 ms) that briefly reduces or stops their firing during the flexion phase. There is a phase-dependent modulation of SP-evoked EPSP amplitude as well as latency during locomotion. However, the more obvious change in SP reflex pathways with the onset of fictive locomotion is the reduced inhibition of ankle extensor motoneurons and the increased inhibition of ankle flexors. These results show that the characteristic pattern of hindlimb motoneuron activation during SP nerve-evoked stumbling correction results from 1) di- and trisynaptic excitation of knee flexor and ankle extensor motoneurons; 2) increased inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in ankle flexors and a suppression of inhibition in extensors, 3) sculpting of the short-latency SP postsynaptic effects by motoneuron membrane potential, and 4) longer latency excitatory effects that are likely evoked by lumbar interneurons involved in the generation of fictive locomotion.",Excluded
3224,"Ultrasound assessment of atheromatous changes in the vertebral and common carotid artery in patients after radiation due to breast cancer Introduction. Early diagnosis and modern radiotherapy have helped to significantly improve the prognosis in breast cancer, decrease mortality and increase the frequency of vascular complications connected with the treatment. The increase in the risk of vascular complications may be caused by inflammatory and atheromatous changes in the coronary and carotid arteries provoked by ionizing radiation. It has been proved that the risk of stroke in a long-term observation of patients who have completed the treatment (average observation time 4.5 years) is significantly higher than in non-treated patients. On the basis of the above information, one can suppose that the factor responsible for acute brain incident, such as stroke, in patients after radiotherapy due to breast cancer, as in patients irradiated because of head and neck cancers, is hemodynamically significant radiation-induced narrowing of the vessels. Objectives. Ultrasound assessment of vessel walls and Doppler measurement of blood flow parameters in the radiated arteries in the supraclavicular area (the first part of the common carotid artery, vertebral artery) as well as determination of a difference in the assessed parameters of the wall morphology and blood flow waveform between the side treated with radiotherapy and the non-treated side. The third aim was the assessment of the dynamics of atheromatous changes over time after finishing radiotherapy. Material and method. A group of 41 patients treated at the Institute of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland were observed from the year 2003 to 2014. The average age of the patients was 60. The dose in the supraclavicular area was identical for all patients and amounted to 50.0 Gy. The average time after the treatment ended was 54 months. The assessment of vessels concerned both common carotid arteries (CCA), the division of the common carotid arteries, the initial internal carotid arteries (ICA) including the measurement of the internal and medial membrane (Intima-Media Thickness - IMT) in the proximal segment of the CCA and the vertebral arteries with particular regard to their proximal segment. Results. The average IMT on the radiated side was 0.68 +/- 0.11 mm, and on the opposite side - 0.62 +/- 0.09 mm. On the basis of the statistical analysis of the differences between average IMT on the radiated side (IMT-RT) and IMT of the non-radiated side (IMT NRT), it has been confirmed that it is statistically significant (p = (0,044) for the assumed relevance level of p = 0.05. When analyzing the change of IMT over the time that passed from the conclusion of treatment, it was found that it had no important influence on the increase in the internal membrane thickness. In the second stage of the research, it was attempted to assess the proximal segment of the vertebral artery and indirectly the subclavian artery using B-duplex ultrasonography. The results show that narrowing is more common on the radiated side. In one case, narrowing of the vertebral artery and its thickening throughout all the observed segment from V0 to V2 were observed, which suggests inflammatory lesions caused by radiation in all three arterial walls. Conclusions. Radiotherapy of patients with breast cancer involving the supraclavicular arteries causes an increase in internal membrane thickness in the common carotid arteries. Radiation of this area increases the frequency of vertebral artery narrowing in the proximal segment. Copyright © ONKOLOGIA I RADIOTERAPIA 2015.",Excluded

3473,"Steroid responsive migratory brain lesions causing intractable epilepsy in multiple myeloma Objective: Description of a patient with multiple myeloma presenting with intractable epilepsy, steroid responsive, and recurrent abnormal T2 signal on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Background(s): Paraneoplastic epilepsy has been described in association with multiple malignancies and has been related to the presence of various antibodies, and/or malignancy spread to the central nervous system (CNS). Here we describe a unique presentation of refractory epilepsy associated with steroid responsive CNS lesions in the setting of multiple myeloma. Design/Methods: N/A Results: A 64 year old man presented with episodic expressive aphasia. His medical history was significant for IgA Kappa multiple myeloma with metastases to the spine since 2013; treated with radiation, chemotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. MRI showed abnormal T2 hyperintense signal on juxtacortical white matter and cortex with no restricted diffusion or contrast enhancement. Seizures seen on EEG were treated. Paraneoplastic, infectious, and malignancy work up was negative, except for >5 oligoclonal bands in serum and CSF suggesting systemic inflammation with secondary CNS involvement. Two weeks later the symptoms reoccurred. MRI showed progression and intravenous solumedrol (IVSM) treatment lead to clinical and radiological improvement. Follow up MRI four months later showed resolution of findings. However, a few weeks later, he presented with status epilepticus (SE). MRI showed multiple new lesions; he received IVSM, which provided a satisfactory response. He was discharged on prednisone. MRI two months later showed marked improvement and prednisone was reduced to 20mg/day. In July, symptoms reoccurred so he was treated again for SE and his MRI showed extensive new lesions. Despite aggressive treatment with anticonvulsants, IVSM and intravenous immunoglobulin, clinical, electrographic and radiographic progression persisted. Family opted for comfort care. Conclusion(s): Better recognition and management of different presentations of various paraneoplastic syndromes represent new challenges in the management of patients with malignancies. Further studies in paraneoplastic syndromes are needed.",Excluded
2567,"MiR-149-3p inhibits the glioma stem cellphenotype and re-sensitizes therapy-resistant GBM cells Intra-tumor heterogeneity presents one of the biggest challenges in the development of solid cancer therapeutics. Cells within the same tumor display distinct phenotypes that affect their growth rate, survival, migration, therapy-response, and tumor-propagating capacity. We now understand cancer stem cells (CSCs) play critical roles in driving intra-tumor cellular heterogeneity by establishing dynamic cellular transitions within tumors. GBM are highly aggressive tumors that display a poorly differentiated cell phenotype characterized by high expression of genes enriched in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Lineage-tracing experiments show that stem-like cells are responsible for GBM re-growth after therapy and this process is in part mediated by known drivers of stemness (e.g. Sox2). There is a strong correlation between the expression of stem cell drivers and markers and tumor recurrence in multiple cancers, including GBM. We and others have established that reprogramming transcription factors Oct4 and Sox2 are important drivers of the stem-cell, tumor and therapy-resistant phenotype in GBM. We present data showing that GBM cells expressing transgenic Oct4 and Sox2 are more resistant to ionizing radiation (IR) treatment and exposing GBM neurospheres to temozolomide (TMZ) and IR gives rise to a cell sub-set with higher gene expression levels of Oct4 and Sox2 compared to untreated cells. The clinical and potential therapeutic relevance of this phenotype is supported by multi-dimensional transcriptome analyses that identifies a group of genes induced by Oct4 and Sox2 enriched in recurrent GBM. The promiscuous quality of miRNAs is an underexploited characteristic that could allow the targeting of multiple parallel oncogenic pathways using a single agent, enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing chances of tumor recurrence. To explore this untapped potential, we predicted miRNAs likely to target the transcripts induced by Oct4/Sox2 in recurrent GBM and identified miR-149-3p as a high-priority candidate. Importantly, transient expression of miR-149-3p simultaneously repressed these transcripts in GSCs as measured by qRT-PCR, concurrent with a decrease in the capacity of both parental and GSCs expressing transgenic Oct4/Sox2 to self-renew as spheres, a biomarker of cell stemness and tumor-propagating potential. Additionally, transient expression of miR-149-3p also re-sensitized therapy-resistant GBM neurospheres to TMZ treatment. These results show this resistant phenotype is reversible and support our hypothesis that GSC-driving mechanisms induce a subset of genes that give rise to therapy-resistant GBM cells and suggests that miR-149-3p can be developed as a therapeutic for recurrent GBM.",Excluded
3160,"Application of PINS radiofrequency pulses to reduce power deposition in RARE/turbo spin echo imaging of the human head Purpose To explore the use of PINS radiofrequency (RF) pulses to reduce RF power deposition in multiband/simultaneous multislice imaging with the RARE/turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence at 3T and 7T. Methods A PINS-TSE sequence was implemented and combined with blipped CAIPI to improve the reconstruction of superposed slices. Whole brain imaging of healthy volunteers was performed at both 3T and 7T using a 32-channel coil for signal reception. Results A considerable reduction in power deposition was achieved compared with a standard sequence of the manufacturer. At 3T, the reduction in specific absorption rate (SAR) made short pulse repetition times (TRs) possible, however, in order to obtain a good T2 contrast, it is advisable to maintain TR while extending the echo train length. At 7T, whole brain coverage with a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 x 2 mm<sup>3</sup> was achieved in an acquisition time of 150 s. Furthermore, it could be shown that pulse sequences that use PINS pulses do not suffer from having additional magnetization transfer contrast. Conclusion PINS RF pulses combined with multiband imaging reduce SAR sufficiently to enable routine TSE imaging at 7T within clinically acceptable acquisition times. In general, the combination of multiband imaging with PINS RF pulses represents a method to reduce total RF power deposition. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
2480,"The role of radiation therapy in the treatment of small cell lung cancer Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are candidates for aggressive therapy because of their potential for long-term survival, especially patients with limited-stage disease. Although no treatment protocol can be considered 'standard', the best results in limited-stage SCLC appear to be produced by a combination of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation. Ongoing protocols testing the efficacy of thoracic irradiation should be able to settle question of the optimal treatment approach in limited-stage SCLC over the next 1 to 2 years. Careful attention to volume treated and the use of shrinking fields produce the best results with the minimum of toxicity. Treatment of extensive-stage SCLC has not been substantially improved to date with the addition of local systemic irradiation. Prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the incidence of CNS failure in SCLC and should be given, at a minimum, to patients achieving complete response status. Whether patients with partial response should also receive prophylactic cranial irradiation remains controversial. Finally, half-body radiation in SCLC is an experimental research technique that has shown some promise but remains quite toxic when combined with systemic chemotherapy.",Excluded

Case report: A 41-year old woman presented with locally advanced small cell anal cancer and simultaneous hepatic and pulmonal deposits. Due to metastatic disease, chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin was performed with mixed response after four cycles of chemotherapy. After application of two additional chemotherapy cycles, locally progressive disease occurred causing symptomatic bowel obstruction. Pelvic irradiation was started and several days later, additional irradiation of cerebral metastases was initiated due to rapid progression of distant disease. Despite adequate local treatment the patient's condition further deteriorated and irradiation was stopped. The patient died 10 months after initial diagnosis due to rapid tumor progression. Conclusion(s): In patients with metastatic small cell anal cancer chemotherapy remains the mainstay of therapy. Radiotherapy exerts additional activity and remains a prime choice to gain local control and ameliorate symptoms.

2769,"Gamma Knife Surgery for Metastatic Brain Tumors from Gynecologic Cancer Objective The incidences of metastatic brain tumors from gynecologic cancer have increased. The results of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from gynecologic cancer (ovarian, endometrial, and uterine cervical cancers) were retrospectively analyzed to identify the efficacy and prognostic factors for local tumor control and survival. Methods The medical records were retrospectively reviewed of 70 patients with 306 tumors who underwent GKS for brain metastases from gynecologic cancer between January 1995 and December 2013 in our institution. Results The primary cancers were ovarian in 33 patients with 147 tumors and uterine in 37 patients with 159 tumors. Median tumor volume was 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup>. Median marginal prescription dose was 20 Gy. The local tumor control rates were 96.4% at 6 months and 89.9% at 1 year. There was no statistically significant difference between ovarian and uterine cancers. Higher prescription dose and smaller tumor volume were significantly correlated with local tumor control. Median overall survival time was 8 months. Primary ovarian cancer, controlled extracranial metastases, and solitary brain metastasis were significantly correlated with satisfactory overall survival. Median activities of daily living (ADL) preservation survival time was 8 months. Primary ovarian cancer, controlled extracranial metastases, and higher Karnofsky Performance Status score were significantly correlated with better ADL preservation. Conclusions GKS is effective for control of tumor progression in patients with brain metastases from gynecologic cancer, and may provide neurologic benefits and preservation of the quality of life.

3381,"[Effect of Low-Intensity 900 MHz Frequency Electromagnetic Radiation on Rat Brain Enzyme Activities Linked to Energy Metabolism] The research deals with the effect of low-intensity 900 MHz frequency electromagnetic radiation (EMR), power density 25 muW/cm2, on the following rat brain and blood serum enzyme activities: creatine kinase (CK), playing a central role in the process of storing and distributing the cell energy, as well as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) that play a key role in providing the conjunction of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. The comparative analysis of the changes in the enzyme activity studied at different times following the two-hour single, as well as fractional, radiation equivalent of the total time showed that the most radiosensitive enzyme is the brain creatine kinase, which may then be recommended as a marker of the radio frequency radiation impact. According to the analysis of the changing dynamics of the CK, ALT and AST activity level, with time these changes acquire the adaptive character and are directed to compensate the damaged cell energy metabolism.",Excluded
2614,"The medial septum mediates impairment of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle induced by a hippocampal seizure or phencyclidine The involvement of the septohippocampal system on the impaired sensorimotor gating induced by phencyclidine (PCP) or by an electrically induced hippocampal seizure was examined in behaving rats. An impaired sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, was observed following a hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) or systemic injection of PCP and was accompanied with an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30-70 Hz). The medial septum infusion with muscimol (0.25 microg), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, 15 min prior to PCP or a hippocampal AD, prevented the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in gamma waves. By itself, muscimol (0.25 microg) injection into the medial septum did not affect PPI, although it significantly suppressed spontaneous gamma waves. In order to identify subpopulations of neurons mediating the sensorimotor gating deficit and the hippocampal gamma wave increase, 0.14-0.21 microg of p75 antibody conjugated to saporin (192 IgG-saporin) was injected into the medial septum to selectively lesion the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Neither the PPI deficit nor the gamma wave increase induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD was affected by 192 IgG-saporin lesion of the medial septum. It is concluded that increase in neural activity in the medial septum participates in the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD. It is suggested that the GABAergic but not the cholinergic septohippocampal neurons mediate the sensorimotor gating deficit.",Excluded
3151,"Creation of a multicenter glioblastoma ontology database: A therapy-guided analysis of genotype to phenotype relationships Objective: To create a multicenter glioblastoma ontology database that can be widely utilized within the neurooncology community and which may lead to targeted treatments based on the analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships. Background(s): Glioblastoma remains one of the most lethal human cancers, with median survival of just 12-15 months after surgical debulking, chemotherapy, and radiation. Numerous molecular targets are being explored for the development of novel therapeutics, but efficacy of these new compounds is limited given the lack of personalized utilization based on known genotypic information. Furthermore, the correlation between driver genetic mutations and various phenotypic characteristics that portend poor prognosis are unknown, thereby diminishing the use of potentially effective medications in the sickest patients. Recently, ontological databases have been developed to better detect genotype-phenotype-environment relationships, with the aim of identifying novel substrates or employing known genomic abnormalities for therapeutic development. Design/Methods: This study focuses on the development of a new multicenter glioblastoma ontology database, with the goal to identify key genotypic characteristics that associate with poor prognosis. Patients were enrolled in the study at each site, clinical information was entered retrospectively into a Redcap database, glioblastoma tissue samples were subjected to whole genome analysis, and a clinical ontology was created based on historical information provided. Result(s): The creation of this glioblastoma ontology serves as proof-of-principle for the potential for clinically meaningful hypothesis generation with such an instrument and as a template for other investigators, who can use relationships described in this ontology to analyze information in their own institutional repositories. The ontology described here will be published online and available for public viewing and broad application. Conclusion(s): This glioblastoma ontology will provide a framework to which other investigators can apply their own clinical data and may help to determine high-yield genomic mutations that can be employed for drug development in glioblastoma.",Excluded
2966,"Autofluorescence spectroscopy as a proxy for chronic white matter pathology Background: The balance of tissue injury and repair ultimately determines outcomes of chronic neurological disorders, such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the extent of pathology can be difficult to detect, particularly when it is insidious and/or offset by tissue regeneration. Objective(s): The objective of this research is to evaluate whether tissue autofluorescence-typically a source of contamination-provides a surrogate marker of white matter injury. Method(s): Tissue autofluorescence in autopsied specimens both experimental and clinical was characterized by spectral confocal microscopy and correlated to severity and chronicity as determined by standard histopathology. Result(s): Months after cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination, despite robust remyelination, autofluorescent deposits progressively accumulated in regions of prior pathology. Autofluorescent deposits (likely reflecting myelin debris remnants) were conspicuously localized to white matter, proportional to lesion severity, and displayed differential fluorescence over time. Strikingly, similar features were apparent also in autopsied MS tissue. Conclusion(s): Autofluorescence spectroscopy illuminates prior and ongoing white matter injury. The accumulation of autofluorescence in proportion to the extent of progressive atrophy, despite robust remyelination in the CPZ brain, provides important proof-of-concept of a phenomenon (insidious ongoing damage masked by mechanisms of tissue repair) that we hypothesize is highly relevant to the progressive phase of MS.

2898,"Phase I/II study of IV topotecan in combination with whole brain radiation for the treatment of brain metastases A phase I/II trial was conducted to determine the toxicities and efficacy (overall response, overall survival, and progression-free survival) of the combination of topotecan and whole brain radiation therapy (XRT) in patients with brain metastases. Patients received 30 Gy XRT given in 10 fractions to the whole brain. In phase I, patients were treated in groups of three at each topotecan dose level; dose escalation proceeded until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified. The dose-limiting toxicity proved to be grade IV neutropenia at 0.6 mg/m2/d, resulting in an MTD of 0.5 mg/m2/d. One of nine patients showed a response to treatment, and that was partial (OR 11%). Three had stable disease (33%), and four experienced progressive disease (44%). Median progression-free survival was 60 d; median overall survival was 102 d. Intravenous topotecan at 0.5 mg/m2/d concomitant to XRT with 30 Gy in 3-Gy fractions is tolerable in patients with brain metastases. This regimen has the additional advantage of providing systemic treatment to patients with metastases in other locations while whole brain radiation is in progress. Although response and survival outcomes in this small study do not appear higher than expected from historical controls, these were not primary end points, and larger studies on this topic would be useful to elucidate the efficacy of this combination treatment regimen. © Copyright 2007 by Humana Press Inc.

2687,"A comparison of radiation exposure between diagnostic CTA and DSA examinations of cerebral and cervicocerebral vessels BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While the number of CTA examinations is continually increasing compared with DSA examinations, there is little comparative dose information about the different imaging techniques. We compared patient radiation exposure resulting from diagnostic CTA and DSA examinations for both cerebral and cervicocerebral vessels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anthropomorphic phantom was irradiated by using typical diagnostic CTA and DSA setups and imaging parameters. For both imaging techniques, the imaging area of cerebral vessels included intracranial vessels only, while the imaging area of cervicocerebral vessels included both cervical and intracranial vessels from the aortic arch to the vertex. The effective dose was determined by using RPLDs. The DSA examination was simulated by using a biplane angiography system, and the CTA examination, by using a 64-row multidetector CT scanner. RESULT(S): For the imaging of cerebral vessels, the effective dose according to ICRP 103 was 0.67 mSv for CTA and 2.71 mSv for DSA. For the imaging of cervicocerebral vessels, the effective dose was 4.85 mSv for CTA and 3.60 mSv for DSA. The maximum absorbed dose (milligray) for skin, brain, salivary glands, and eyes was 166.2, 73.5, 35.6, and 21.8 mGy for DSA and 19.0, 16.9, 20.4, and 14.8 mGy for CTA, respectively. The conversion factors from DAP and DLP to effective dose were calculated.

Radioligand distribution was consistent with the density of high affinity nAChRs with highest uptake observed in the nAChR-rich thalamus (14.9 %ID/g at 60 min), moderate uptake in cortex (8.5 %ID/g at 60 min), and lowest uptake in the cerebellum (2.4 %ID/g at 60 min). Pretreatment with several different nAChR agonists (A-85380, (-)-nicotine, cytisine) significantly inhibited [I-125]-5-IA binding in all brain regions studied (P < 0.01) demonstrating the high specificity of the radioligand for nAChRs.

The tumor was entirely within the treatment region in all patients. The fraction of the predicted high-dose and low-dose regions corresponding with an absolute scotoma was fitted by a linear regression model (r2 = .721) with three independent variables: dose region, initial condition, and time since therapy. The defect in the maximum-dose region increased at an average rate of 0.270/year. This differed (P = .002) from the rate in the penumbra region: (0.104/year). The rate in the penumbra differed (P = .01) from that in the predicted low-dose region, where scotoma did not increase with time. The pattern and time course of visual field loss in the different radiation dose regions tended to support the conclusion that isodose calculations are accurate. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that visual loss secondary to irradiation results primarily from radiation vasculopathy and not from direct damage to photoreceptors or ganglion cells.

The main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a new quinolone derivative; 2-(1-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid (EHQA) and its possible mechanism against gamma radiation (IRR) and cisplatin (Cis) induced nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity in mice. The structure of the newly synthesized quinolone derivative was elucidated by microanalytical and spectral data, which were found consistent with the assigned structures. Exposure to Cis and IRR significantly induced renal damage manifested by a significant increase in levels of urea and creatinine. Moreover, the exposure to both Cis and IRR significantly decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic protein; Bcl-2 in both renal and brain tissue homogenate accompanied by activation of an inflammatory marker; IL-17. Immunophenoting results showed an activation of T- lymphocytes marker; CD3 and B-lymphocytes marker; CD19. Interperitonial administration of EHQA significantly ameliorated the above-mentioned parameters.

3144,"Regeneration of dopaminergic neurons after 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion in planarian brain Planarians have robust regenerative ability dependent on X-ray-sensitive pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts. Here, we report that planarians can regenerate dopaminergic neurons after selective degeneration of these neurons caused by treatment with a dopaminergic neurotoxin (6-hydroxydopamine; 6-OHDA). This suggests that planarians have a system to sense the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and to recruit stem cells to produce dopaminergic neurons to recover brain morphology and function. We confirmed that X-ray-irradiated planarians do not regenerate brain dopaminergic neurons after 6-OHDA-induced lesioning, suggesting that newly generated dopaminergic neurons are indeed derived from pluripotent stem cells. However, we found that the majority of regenerated dopaminergic neurons were 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-negative cells. Therefore, we carefully analyzed when proliferating stem cells became committed to become dopaminergic neurons during regeneration by a combination of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments, immunostaining/in situ hybridization, and 5-fluorouracil treatment. The results strongly suggested that G(2) -phase stem cells become committed to dopaminergic neurons in the mesenchymal space around the brain, after migration from the trunk region following S-phase.

2953,"Regulation of prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> synthesis after brain irradiation Purpose: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> (PGE <inf>2</inf>) levels seen after radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE <inf>2</inf> production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE<inf>2</inf> production and PGES expression. Result(s): As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE<inf>2</inf> levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE<inf>2</inf> seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls. Conclusion(s): Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE<inf>2</inf> production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",Included
3191,"Structural and enzymatic aspects of rhodopsin phosphorylation Photoactivated rhodopsin (Rho*) is phosphorylated near the C terminus at multiple sites, predominantly at Ser334, Ser338, and Ser343. We systematically examined the sites of phosphorylation upon flash activation of Rho in rod outer segment (ROS) homogenates. Addition of an inhibitory antibody against rhodopsin kinase (RK) lowered phosphorylation at Ser334, Ser338, and Ser343, without changing the ratio between phosphorylation sites. In contrast, no effect of protein kinase C was detected after stimulation (by a phorbol ester), inhibition (with H7), or reconstitution of protein kinase C with purified ROS membranes. The stoichiometry and the ratio between different phosphorylation sites in purified Rho were also reproduced using RK, purified to apparent homogeneity from ROS or from an insect cell expression system. Thus, we conclude that light-dependent phosphorylation of Rho is mediated primarily by RK. Depalmitoylation of Rho at Cys322 and Cys323 altered the conformation of the C terminus of Rho, as observed by phosphorylation by casein kinase I, but did not affect phosphorylation by RK. The sites of phosphorylation were influenced, however, by the presence of four conserved amino acids at the C terminus of Rho. The accumulation of phosphorylated Ser334 observed in vivo could result from slower dephosphorylation of this site as compared with dephosphorylation of Ser338 and Ser343. These data provide a molecular mechanism for the site-specific phosphorylation of Rho observed in vivo.",Excluded
3217,"Chemoradiotherapy for primary CNS lymphoma: an intent-to-treat analysis with complete follow-up OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of a preradiation chemotherapy regimen in patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), with emphasis on long-term outcomes.METHODS: In this prospective phase II trial, patients with a new diagnosis of PCNSL received two cycles of intrathecal (12 mg) and IV (1 g/m2) methotrexate (MTX), thiotepa (30 mg/m2), and procarbazine (75 mg/m2), prior to whole-brain radiotherapy (RT).RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled (ages 26 to 71, median 53). Median Karnofsky performance scale score was 70. After chemotherapy, 7 patients (41%) had a complete response (CR) and 7 (41%) a partial response (PR). After RT, 13 (76%) patients achieved a CR, 2 (12%) a PR, and 2 (12%) had disease progression. Relapse occurred in 7 (41%) patients; median disease-free survival was 18 months. Fifteen (88%) patients have died: 8 (47%) from PCNSL, 5 (29%) from neurotoxicity, and 2 (12%) from unknown causes. Median overall survival was 32 months. Two patients (12%) are alive and disease free at 12 years follow-up. Nephrotoxicity was a minor complication, but grades 3 and 4 myelosuppression were found in 5 (29%) patients.CONCLUSIONS: This regimen resulted in an efficacy and toxicity profile comparable to other combined modality treatments, despite the relatively low dose of methotrexate. It may be a useful option in patients unable to tolerate higher doses. Procarbazine and thiotepa are potential candidates for incorporation into chemotherapy regimens aiming to decrease the incidence of neurotoxicity. First relapse and neurotoxicity within 2 years of diagnosis seem to be critical for predicting long-term outcomes.",Excluded
3061,"Comparing survival predicted by the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) to actual survival in patients with 1-10 brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple prognostic models for predicting survival after treatment for brain metastases have been developed. One of them, the diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA), has been developed to predict the median survival for brain metastases from the most frequent primary sites: lung carcinoma, breast cancer, melanoma, renal cell cancer and gastrointestinal tumours. In this study we aim to compare the survival predicted by the DS-GPA to actual survival, and to assess this models performance on both population and individual levels.METHODS: We identified a consecutive cohort of patients treated with SRS for brain metastases in our institute. DS-GPA scores were calculated for each patient, and the median survival for each DS-GPA group was calculated. Differences in survival between DS-GPA groups were tested with Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and log-rank tests.RESULTS: In total 367 patients were included in the analysis. Median survival in our cohort is largely comparable to corresponding DS-GPA cohorts, but some notable differences are present. There was a significantly shorter median survival (15.4months, compared to 26.5months) in the adenocarcinoma NSCLC subgroup with a GPA score of 2.3-3. We confirmed the significant differences in survival time for most cancer-specific subgroups.CONCLUSION: DS-GPA seems to be a reliable tool to classify patients with brain metastases treated with SRS into prognostic subgroups. However, we found some aberrations from predicted median survival times, which may be due to specific characteristics of the populations of patients treated with SRS versus other patients.",Excluded

3181,"Spatial correlation of linear energy transfer and relative biological effectiveness with suspected treatment-related toxicities following proton therapy for intracranial tumors PURPOSE: The enhanced relative biological effectiveness (RBE) at the end of the proton range might increase the risk of radiation-induced toxicities. This is of special concern for intracranial treatments where several critical organs at risk (OARs) surround the tumor. In the light of this, a retrospective analysis of dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET<sub>d</sub> ) and RBE-weighted dose (D<sub>RBE</sub> ) distributions was conducted for three clinical cases with suspected treatment-related toxicities following intracranial proton therapy. Alternative treatment strategies aiming to reduce toxicity risks are also presented.METHODS: The clinical single-field optimized (SFO) plans were recalculated for 81 error scenarios with a Monte Carlo dose engine. The fractionation D<sub>RBE</sub> was 1.8 Gy (RBE) in 28 or 30 fractions assuming a constant RBE of 1.1. Two LET<sub>d</sub> - and alpha/beta-dependent variable RBE models were used for evaluation, including a sensitivity analysis of the alpha/beta parameter. Resulting distributions of D<sub>RBE</sub> and LET<sub>d</sub> were analyzed together with normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs). Subsequently, four multi-field optimized (MFO) plans, with an additional beam and/or objectives penalizing protons stopping in OARs, were created to investigate the potential reduction of LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP.RESULTS: The two variable RBE models agreed well and predicted average RBE values around 1.3 in the toxicity volumes, resulting in an increased near-maximum D<sub>RBE</sub> of 7-11 Gy (RBE) compared to RBE = 1.1 in the nominal scenario. The corresponding NTCP estimates increased from 0.8%, 0.0%, and 3.7% (RBE = 1.1) to 15.5%, 1.8%, and 45.7% (Wedenberg RBE model) for the three patients, respectively. The MFO plans generally allowed for LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP reductions in OARs, without compromising the target dose. Compared to the clinical SFO plans, the maximum reduction in the near-maximum LET<sub>d</sub> was 56%, 63%, and 72% in the OAR exhibiting the toxicity for the three patients, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Although a direct causality between RBE and toxicity cannot be established here, high LET<sub>d</sub> and D<sub>RBE</sub> correlated spatially with the observed toxicities, whereas setup and range uncertainties had a minor impact. Individual factors, which might affect the patient-specific radiosensitivity, were however not included in these calculations. The MFO plans using both an additional beam and proton track-end objectives allowed the largest reductions in LET<sub>d</sub> , D<sub>RBE</sub> , and NTCP, and might be future tools for similar cases.",Excluded

Purpose(s): To assess the effect of gadodiamide and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) on T<inf>1</inf>-weighted images and on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of DN. Study Type: Single-center retrospective. Population: In all, 125 patients who underwent brain MRIs were classified into four groups: 1) patients who did neither receive intravenous GBCAs injections nor irradiation (controls); 2) patients having >=3 GBCAs-enhanced scans and no WBRT; 3) patients having WBRT and < 3 GBCAs-enhanced scans; and 4) patients having WBRT and >= 3 GBCAs-enhanced scans. Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5T magnet, echo-planar diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and unenhanced T<inf>1</inf>-weighted sequences. Assessment: The DN-to-pons SI ratio on unenhanced T<inf>1</inf>-weighted images and ADC values of the DN were calculated. Values were compared between groups and relative to the cumulative gadolinium dose and to the time delay after WBRT. Statistical Tests: Statistical analysis included the Mann-Whitney U-test and Spearman's rank-order correlation. Result(s): DN ADC values were not significantly different (P = 0.34) between patients exposed to gadodiamide (0.81 +/- 0.06) and controls (0.83 +/- 0.07). There were no differences in DN ADC values (P = 0.28) and DN-to-pons SI ratios (P = 0.42) between patients exposed to WBRT (ADC values: 0.85 +/- 0.09; SI ratio: 1.11 +/- 0.10) and controls (ADC values: 0.83 +/- 0.06; SI ratio: 1.09 +/- 0.06). There was a significant negative correlation between DN ADC values and the time (days) since the end of WBRT (r = - 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.55, -0.06; P < 0.05).

Sixty-five patients were identified who had received continuous course once-daily 1.8-2 Gy fractions to approximately 60 Gy (range 58-66). All patients received chemotherapy (CHT); 32 received concurrent RT/CHT and 33 sequential CHT and then RT. Prophylactic cranial RT was administered to 17 patients. The time from diagnosis to local failure, tumor progression, and death was assessed using actuarial methods. The median follow-up for all patients was 16.7 months and for surviving patients was 29.6 months. The median age was 64 years (range 36-83), and the median Karnofsky performance status was 80 (range 50-100).RESULTS: The 3-year actuarial rate of local failure, progression-free survival, and overall survival was 40%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. One case of acute Grade 3 esophagitis developed. Ten late complications occurred: four pulmonary, two esophageal, two infectious, one leukemia, and one retinal toxicity with prophylactic cranial RT. Six were mild and resolved with treatment.CONCLUSION: CHT plus approximately 60 Gy of once-daily RT for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer was generally well tolerated. The survival rates were less than have been reported using 45 Gy in 1.5-Gy twice-daily fractions (2-year overall survival rate 47% compared with 30% in this study), but may be comparable because fewer than one-half our patients received concurrent CHT/RT and only 26% received prophylactic cranial RT. The relatively low rate of normal tissue morbidity in our patients supports the use of conventional once-daily fractionation to > or = 60 Gy. A randomized trial would be required to compare the outcomes after maximally tolerated dose twice-daily RT vs. maximally tolerated dose daily RT.",Excluded

The cumulative data indicate that mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation is blunted following short-duration missions. Since similar responses may also be obtained following exposure to non-spaceflight stressors (hypoxia and academic stress), it is unclear if microgravity per se aggravates this response. Our studies indicate that stress-induced impaired PHA- and PWM-stimulated activation can be detected within the first 24 hours in culture at the level of protein synthesis. While the mechanism for neuroendocrine-mediated blunted mitogen stimulated T cell proliferation has not been elucidated, it is not aggravated by autologous plasma and does not require changes in mononuclear cell subpopulations. While prior studies indicate lymphocyte activation is influenced by altering G forces on in vitro cultures, impaired cellular interactions or suboptimal microenvironments related to reduced cell densities in microgravity may contribute to the greatly impaired mitogen stimulated proliferation responses observed on Spacelab flights. It will be necessary to perform lymphocyte functional assays on crewmembers during spaceflight to determine to contribution of microgravity per se on altered human immune competence.",Excluded
3499,"Multiple cone pathways are involved in photic regulation of retinal dopamine Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the retina and plays a central role in the light adaptive processes of the visual system. The sole source of retinal dopamine is dopaminergic amacrine cells (DACs). We and others have previously demonstrated that DACs are activated by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) upon illumination. However, it is still not clear how each class of photosensitive cells generates light responses in DACs. We genetically isolated cone function in mice to specifically examine the cone-mediated responses of DACs and their neural pathways. In addition to the reported excitatory input to DACs from light-increment (ON) bipolar cells, we found that cones alternatively signal to DACs via a retrograde signalling pathway from ipRGCs. Cones also produce ON and light-decrement (OFF) inhibitory responses in DACs, which are mediated by other amacrine cells, likely driven by type 1 and type 2/3a OFF bipolar cells, respectively. Dye injections indicated that DACs had similar morphological profiles with or without ON/OFF inhibition. Our data demonstrate that cones utilize specific parallel excitatory and inhibitory circuits to modulate DAC activity and efficiently regulate dopamine release and the light-adaptive state of the retina.",Excluded

Patients in the treatment group were administrated pregabalin for 8 weeks combined with rehabilitation, while the control group only received rehabilitation. The clinical therapeutic effects were observed and evaluated by mandibular motion, severity of trismus measured by late effects of normal tissues/subjective and objective medical analysis (LENT/SOMA) scales, and quality of life (QOL) assessed using the World Health Organization QOL instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) at baseline, week 4 and week 8 during treatment in these two groups, respectively.RESULTS: In the treatment group, the number of patients with improvement on maximal vertical dimension (MVD) was significantly more than controls at week 4 and week 8 (P=0.013, P=0.004, respectively). Moreover, at week 4 and week 8, the severity of trismus was both significantly improved on LENT/SOMA grade in treatment group (P=0.047, P=0.032, respectively). And at week 8, the physical health and the whole life domain of the WHOQOL-BREF score were significantly increased (P=0.037, P=0.034, respectively).

The head of 15 healthy male subjects was unilaterally exposed for 30 min prior to sleep to a pulse-modulated EMF (GSM handset like signal) with a 10 g-averaged peak spatial specific absorption rate of (1) 0.2 W kg(-1), (2) 5 W kg(-1), or (3) sham exposed in a double-blind, crossover design. During exposure, subjects performed two series of three computerized cognitive tasks, each presented in a fixed order [simple reaction time task, two-choice reaction time task (CRT), 1-, 2-, 3-back task]. Immediately after exposure, night-time sleep was polysomnographically recorded for 8 h. Sleep architecture was not affected by EMF exposure. Analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a dose-dependent increase of power in the spindle frequency range in non-REM sleep. Reaction speed decelerated with increasing field intensity in the 1-back task, while accuracy in the CRT and N-back task were not affected in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, this study reveals first indications of a dose-response relationship between EMF field intensity and its effects on brain physiology as demonstrated by changes in the sleep EEG and in cognitive performance.",Excluded

Survival outcomes were retrospectively analysed in a consecutive series of 67 newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients who had received either conventional fractionated photon radiotherapy (CRT) or high-dose particle radiotherapy (HDT). In the CRT protocol, a total dose of 60.0-61.2 Gy was administered. In the HDT protocol, an average dose of approximately 30 GyE in a single session and additional fractionated photon irradiation of total dose 30 Gy were administered to patients receiving boron neutron capture therapy; and a total dose of 96.6 GyE was administered to patients receiving proton therapy. Most of the patients had received chemotherapy with nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) alone or with ACNU, procarbazine and vincristine. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival times for all patients were 17.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.6-20.9 months] and 7.8 months (95% CI, 5.7-9.9 months), respectively. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 67.2% and 33.7%, respectively. For patients treated with HDT, the median OS was 24.4 months (95% CI, 18.2-30.5 months), compared with 14.2 months (95% CI, 10.0-18.3 months) for those treated with CRT. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed radiation modality (HDT vs CRT) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recursive partitioning analysis class to be the significant prognostic factors. Age, sex, pre-operative performance status, treatment with or without advanced neuroimaging, extent of surgery and regimen of chemotherapy were not statistically significant factors in predicting prognosis.

3168,"High-frequency afferent stimulation induces long-term potentiation of field potentials in the ventral tegmental area Excitatory synapses on dopamine neurons in the VTA can undergo both long-term potentiation and depression. Additionally, drug-induced plasticity has been found at VTA synapses, and is proposed to play a role in reward-related learning and addiction by modifying dopamine cell firing. LTP at these synapses is difficult to generate experimentally in that it requires an undisturbed intracellular milieu and is often small in magnitude. Here, we demonstrate the induction of LTP as a property of evoked field potentials within the VTA. Excitatory field potentials were recorded extracellularly from VTA neurons in acute horizontal midbrain slices. Using extracellular and intracellular recording techniques, we found that evoked field potentials originate within the VTA itself and are largely composed of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSPs and action potentials triggered by activation of glutamatergic synapses on both dopamine and GABA neurons. High-frequency afferent stimulation (HFS) induced LTP of the field potential. The induction of this LTP was blocked by application of the NMDAR antagonist, d-APV, prior to HFS. As reported previously, glutamatergic synapses on GABA neurons did not express LTP while those on dopamine neurons did. We conclude that the potentiation of glutamatergic synapses on dopamine neurons is a major contributor to NMDA receptor-dependent LTP of the field potential. Field potential recordings may provide a convenient approach to explore the basic electrophysiological properties of VTA neurons and the development of addiction-related processes in this brain region.",Excluded

Recently, retinal photoreception was reported to be important for the circadian pacemaking activities of the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. We aimed to confirm the photic and circadian responsiveness of its close relative-the Mozambique tilapia O. mossambicus. Melatonin production in cannulated or ophthalmectomized fish and its secretion from cultured pineal glands were examined under several light regimes. Melatonin production in the cannulated tilapias was measured at 3-h intervals; it fluctuated daily, with a nocturnal increase and a diurnal decrease. Exposing the cannulated fish to several light intensities (1500-0.1 lx) and to natural light (0.1 and 0.3 lx) suppressed melatonin levels within 30 min. Static pineal gland culture under light-dark and reverse light-dark cycles revealed that melatonin synthesis increased during the dark periods. Rhythmic melatonin synthesis disappeared on pineal gland culture under constant dark and light conditions. After ophthalmectomy, plasma melatonin levels did not vary with light-dark cycles. These results suggest that (1) Mozambique tilapias possess strong photic responsiveness, (2) their pineal glands are sensitive to light but lack circadian pacemaker activity, and (3) they require lateral eyes for rhythmic melatonin secretion from the pineal gland.",Excluded
2498,"Abciximab (ReoPro) Dosing Strategy for the Management of Acute Intraprocedural Thromboembolic Complications during Pipeline Flow Diversion Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms Background: Flow diversion with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) is an effective neuro-endovascular method and increasingly accepted for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Acute in situ thrombosis is a known complication of PED procedures. There is limited experience in the flow diversion literature on the use of abciximab (ReoPro) for the management of acute thrombus formation in PED cases. Method(s): Data were collected retrospectively on patients who received intra-arterial (IA) ReoPro with or without subsequent intravenous (IV) infusion during PED flow diversion treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Result(s): A total of 30 cases in patients with a mean age of 56.7 years (range 36-84) and a mean aneurysm size of 8.6 mm (range 2-25) were identified to have intraprocedural thromboembolic complications during PED treatment. IA ReoPro was administered in all cases, with 20 cases receiving increments of 5-mg boluses and 10 cases receiving a 0.125 mg/kg IA bolus (half cardiac dosing). Complete or partial recanalization was achieved in 100% of the cases. IV ReoPro infusion at 0.125 mug/kg/min for 12 h was administered postprocedurally in 22 cases with a residual thrombus. Postprocedurally, 18 patients were transitioned from clopidogrel (Plavix) to prasugrel (Effient). The majority of the cases (23/30; 77%) were discharged home. Periprocedural intracranial hemorrhage was noted in 2 cases (7%) and radiographic infarct was noted in 4 cases (13%), with an overall mortality of 0% at the time of initial discharge. Clinical follow-up was available for 28/30 patients. The average duration of follow-up was 11.7 months, at which time 23/28 (82%) of the patients had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0.

Using a dosing strategy of either 5-mg increments or a 0.125 mg/kg IA bolus (half cardiac dosing) can provide high rates of recanalization with low rates of hemorrhagic complications and long-term morbidity.

3582,"Use of 2-deoxy-D[1-11C]glucose for the determination of local cerebral glucose metabolism in humans: variation within and between subjects The deoxyglucose technique for the measurement of local cerebral glucose metabolism (LCMRgl) has been widely applied in animals utilizing 14C-deoxyglucose and in humans employing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Repeat studies in humans over a relatively brief period of time have not been possible because of the 110-min half-life of fluorine-18. With the synthesis of 11C-deoxyglucose it has now become possible to utilize this short-lived (20 min) tracer for the measurement of LCMRgl and to determine its variability within subjects over a 2-h period. The kinetic rate constants for 11C-deoxyglucose were determined for gray and white matter and found to be very similar to those for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, suggesting that these two analogues of glucose have similar affinities for the facilitated transport system and are similar substrates for hexokinase in the brain. The coefficient of variation of repeated measurements of LCMRgl in a series of six normal subjects was 5.5% to 8.7% for various gray matter structures and 9.7% and 14.0% for white matter structures. The pattern of cerebral metabolic rates is relatively constant in a given individual when the conditions of the study are unchanged. The ability to make repeat measurements in the same subject reduces the variance due to between-subject differences, allowing smaller changes in LCMRgl to be detected with confidence.",Excluded

Fractional anisotropy (FA) quantifies the extent of directionality of water diffusion. We investigated absorbed dose as a predictor of FA change in the corpus callosum (CC) following radiation therapy for high grade glioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with high-grade glioma underwent DTI scans before, and ten months after radiation therapy to 59.4-60 Gy. Diffusion data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Using an automated white matter fiber tracking technique, 23 fiber tracts were segmented on the baseline and follow-up DTI images. The CT images used for treatment planning and both DTI image sets were aligned using non-linear registration. This way, the baseline FA, the follow-up FA, and the absorbed dose could be determined for each voxel in all 15 patients. For each voxel in the CC, we calculated the FA change as FA follow-up /FA baseline and dichotomized the data into a binary outcome variable using 0.5 as cutoff. For all 15 patients, logistic regression was used to determine dose-response curve parameters (D50 and g50) and their confidence intervals (CIs). We used the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) to evaluate the discriminative ability of the voxel dose. Then, we estimated dose-response curve parameters and calculated the AUC for each patient individually. Result(s): The median age was 59 (range: 40-85) years. The average CC volume and average CC mean absorbed dose was 62+/-8 cm3 and 26+/-14 Gy (1 SD), respectively. Using data from 99 691 voxels, the estimated parameters for the doseresponse curve for all patients (upper panel in Figure 1) were D50=88.0+/-0.1 Gy and gamma50=0.80+/-0.01 (95% CIs). The AUC was 0.71 indicating good discriminative ability. For nine out of 15 patients, the individual AUC was >=0.60, indicating that higher absorbed dose is associated with higher probability of FA change >=0.5. Dose -response curves for those patients are shown in the lower panel in Figure 1 and their estimated parameter values in Table 1. Individual D50s varied between 41.3 and 125.9 Gy. Conclusion(s): Absorbed dose was a significant predictor of FA change in the CC.

More detailed analyses are needed to better understand the effect radiation has on water diffusion in brain white matter. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
3443,"[The absolute light sensitivity of the visual analyzer in sailors during a 10-month commercial voyage] For the purpose of studying the influence of extreme conditions of a long-term voyage on the functional state of the visual analyser, light sensitivity was studied in 21 seamen. It is shown that adaptation mechanisms regulating light sensitivity have a phase tendency: phase is characterized by a rise of the level of light sensitivity within first 90-120 days of the voyage; phase II--by a gradual fall of the level of light sensitivity beginning from 120-140 days of the long-term voyage. The investigations performed allow to create an informative diagnostic test for a well-grounded therapy intended to widen adaptive possibilities of the system responsible for regulation of light sensitivity.",Excluded
2561,"Regulation of the DNA damage kinase ATM in the immune system ATM is the protein kinase that is mutated in the hereditary autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). A-T patients display immune deficiencies, cancer predisposition, neuronal degeneration and radiosensitivity. The molecular role of ATM is to respond to DNA double-strand breaks and alterations in chromatin structure by phosphorylating its substrates, thereby promoting repair of damage or arresting the cell cycle. ATM is activated by two known co-factors in a stimulus dependent manner. Following the induction of double-strand breaks by ionising radiation, NBS1 (mutated in Nijmegen breakage syndrome) is required for activation of ATM. ATM can also be activated in the absence of DNA damage by agents that induce changes in chromatin structure. We have recently described ATMIN, for ATM INteractor, to be required for ATM activation under these conditions. How ATM is regulated within the context of the immune system is unclear. We are using genetic mouse models to dissect the contribution of the ATM co-factors, ATMIN and NBS, to its function within the immune system. We will present data on how ATM is regulated within lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells in vivo, in order to maintain a functional immune system and suppress tumorigenesis.",Excluded
3503,"The utility of surgical excision in the contemporary treatment of metastatic brain disease Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with oligometastatic brain disease are typically treated with SRS +/- tumor resection (with whole brain radiation [WBXRT] reserved for refractory cases). There exist no data regarding the local control benefits (if any) of surgery prior to SRS. Materials/Methods: Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all patients undergoing SRS with or without prior tumor excision at our institution. No patient had received prior WBXRT. Factors related to patient survival were determined by Cox regression; time-torecurrence (TTR) was analyzed similarly but with robust residuals to account for clustering. Non-progressing tumors which received WBXRT (for another progressing tumor) were censored at time of WBXRT. There were 162 patients identified (82/80 M/F, average 65.3), with a total of 260 tumors, of which 119 were solitary. Although surgical patients were younger, had better performance status and less burden of disease compared to SRS alone, none of these differences were statistically significant, although the RPA class was significantly better in the SRS+ surgery group (p = .003, Mann-Whitney). Forty-nine patients had a total of 51 tumors resected (2 patients with 2 resected), of which 33 were solitary. Complete resection, as determined by 24-hour contrasted MRI, was achieved in 45 (88%). A total of 73 tumors (28%) in 45 patients were considered to have locally progressed, 20 of which had previously undergone resection. Result(s): Median survival for all patients was 8.7 months, with survival for complete resection + SRS, incomplete resection + SRS and SRS alone at 14.1, 7.1, and 6.9 months, respectively (p = .03, log-rank). Survival by RPA class was 26.9, 8.7, and 1.5 for classes 1-3, respectively (p = .0004, log-rank). Median TTR was 14.8 months for all tumors, with TTR for complete resection + SRS, incomplete resection + SRS and SRS alone at 22.5, 6.4, and 14.8 months respectively (p = .004, log-rank). In the stepwise Cox regression analysis, overall survival was related to age (HR = 1.02, p = 0.037), ECOG performance score (HR = 1.9, p = 0.0001) and complete surgical excision (HR = .55, p = 0.01). Analysis of TTR demonstrated the following significantly related factors: radiation sensitive pathology (non-renal or melanoma) (HR = 0.367, p = 0.01), tumor size (HR = 1.43, p = 0.0012), and complete tumor resection (HR = 0.348, p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Although complete surgical excision + SRS are associated with prolonged survival, results may be skewed due to selection bias. TTR represents an unbiased estimate of the effect of surgery and shows SRS alone is associated with a 3 times increased likelihood of recurrence over complete resection + SRS, even when controlling for lesion size and pathology. Incomplete resection did not improve survival or TTR compared to SRS alone.",Excluded

Defining progressive disease (PD) using RECIST has been challenging in the era of targeted and immunotherapy, as some patients are perceived to be deriving ongoing benefit despite PD by RECIST. We explore the impact of treatment beyond progression with ALK-I on patient symptoms and treatment duration. Method(s): Patients with advanced ALK-rearranged lung cancer treated at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between 2009 and 2017 were identified. Treatment duration was obtained from medical records, assessment of PFS by RECIST 1.1 from patient imaging, and patient self-reported symptoms and performance status (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), ECOG PS) were collected prospectively. Result(s): 66 patients were identified with advanced ALK-rearranged lung cancer. The median age at diagnosis was 61 years, 49% were male, 78%presented with stage 4 disease, 47 received ALK-I therapy (median 2 lines, range 1-4). Over half (26/47, 55%) continued ALK-I treatment beyond RECIST PD. PD occurred most commonly in brain (15/47), lung and/or pleura (11/47); 17/47 received local therapy (predominantly radiation) and continued ALK-I. Data on time to RECIST PD and treatment failure are shown below. Only 34/47 patients had symptomdata available at baseline, 22 with severe symptoms; 70% improved with initial ALK-I treatment. At the time of RECIST PD, most of those continuing ALK-I beyond progression had not experienced deterioration of symptoms.

2458,"Relationship between neurocognitive function and quality of life after whole-brain radiotherapy in patients with brain metastasis PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between neurocognitive function (NCF) and quality of life (QOL) in patients with brain metastases after whole-brain radiotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 208 patients from the whole-brain radiotherapy arm of a Phase III trial (PCI-P120-9801), who underwent regular NCF and QOL (ADL [activities of daily living] and FACT-Br [Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain-specific]) testing, were analyzed. Spearman's rank correlation was calculated between NCF and QOL, using each patient's own data, at each time point. To test the hypothesis that NCF declines before QOL changes, the predictive effect of NCF from previous visits on QOL was studied with a linear mixed-effects model. Neurocognitive function or QOL deterioration was defined relative to each patient's own baseline. Lead or lag time, defined as NCF deterioration before or after the date of QOL decline, respectively, was computed.RESULTS: At baseline, all NCF tests showed statistically significant correlations with ADL, which became stronger at 4 months. A similar observation was made with FACT-Br. Neurocognitive function scores from previous visits predicted ADL (p < 0.05 for seven of eight tests) or FACT-Br. Scores on all eight NCF tests deteriorated before ADL decline (net lead time 9-153 days); and scores on six of eight NCF tests deteriorated before FACT-Br (net lead time 9-82 days).CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive function and QOL are correlated. Neurocognitive function scores from previous visits are predictive of QOL. Neurocognitive function deterioration precedes QOL decline. The sequential association between NCF and QOL decline suggests that delaying NCF deterioration is a worthwhile treatment goal in brain metastases patients.",Excluded

We performed a phase I study to evaluate the safety and dosimetry of the sstr2 antagonists 68Ga-OPS201 and 177Lu-OPS201 (68Ga/177Lu-DOTA-JR11) in patients with metastatic well differentiated NETs (NCT02609737). Method(s): Patients with RECIST disease progression underwent a 68Ga-OPS202 PET/CT to confirm in-vivo binding of the sstr2 antagonists and if positive, underwent treatment with 3 doses of 177Lu-OPS201. The first dose of 50 mCi 177Lu-OPS201was used to calculate tumor and normal organ radiation doses. Dosimetry was then calculated to administer 177Lu-OPS201 in divided doses for the 2nd and 3rd fractions, 8-10 weeks apart. Result(s): 19 patients enrolled (1 lung, 7 small bowel, 8 pancreatic, 1 gastric, 1 rectal, 1 kidney). Average age was 55 y (22-73 y), 52% female; mean number of prior treatments was 3. All patients received 1 therapeutic dose of 177Lu-OPS201, 7 patients received 2 doses.With the exception of the kidneys and bladder, no organ demonstrated uptake of 68Ga-OPS201 above background. Tumor radiation doses ranged from 0.15 Gy/mCi to 0.48 Gy/mCi. Subacute hematologic toxicity after cycle 1 was mild-moderate (G3 2/19 leukopenia that reversed before cycle 2). 4/7 (57%) patients that received the second dose of 177Lu-OPS201had G4 hematological toxicities, which occurred 4-6 weeks after administration. G 3/4 toxicities in the four patients have resolved to G2 or lower; none of these patients demonstrated fever, infection, bleeding, or renal toxicity. Substantial efficacy was observed: 1 patient achieved a CR (1/19, 5%), 32% PR (6/19), 47% SD (9/19), and 16% POD (3/19). Median PFS has not yet been reached.

3559,"Patterning the cone mosaic array in zebrafish retina requires specification of ultraviolet-sensitive cones Cone photoreceptors in teleost fish are organized in precise, crystalline arrays in the epithelial plane of the retina. In zebrafish, four distinct morphological/spectral cone types occupy specific, invariant positions within a regular lattice. The cone lattice is aligned orthogonal and parallel to circumference of the retinal hemisphere: it emerges as cones generated in a germinal zone at the retinal periphery are incorporated as single-cell columns into the cone lattice. Genetic disruption of the transcription factor Tbx2b eliminates most of the cone subtype maximally sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths and also perturbs the long-range organization of the cone lattice. In the tbx2b mutant, the other three cone types (red, green, and blue cones) are specified in the correct proportion, differentiate normally, and acquire normal, planar polarized adhesive interactions mediated by Crumbs 2a and Crumbs 2b. Quantitative image analysis of cell adjacency revealed that the cones in the tbx2b mutant primarily have two nearest neighbors and align in single-cell-wide column fragments that are separated by rod photoreceptors. Some UV cones differentiate at the dorsal retinal margin in the tbx2b mutant, although they are severely dysmorphic and are eventually eliminated. Incorporating loss of UV cones during formation of cone columns at the margin into our previously published mathematical model of zebrafish cone mosaic formation (which uses bidirectional interactions between planar cell polarity proteins and anisotropic mechanical stresses in the plane of the retinal epithelium to generate regular columns of cones parallel to the margin) reproduces many features of the pattern disruptions seen in the tbx2b mutant.",Excluded
3379,"Reduced-dose radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas OBJECTIVE: To evaluate tumor control and complications associated with low-dose radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas. METHOD(S): Between December 1993 and January 2000, 47 patients with vestibular schwannomas were treated at our center with gamma knife radiosurgery. The marginal tumor doses ranged from 7.5 to 14.0 Gy (median, 12.0 Gy) for patients treated after microsurgery and from 10.0 to 15.0 Gy (median, 12.0 Gy) for patients in whom radiosurgery was the primary treatment. The median maximum tumor diameter was 18 mm (range, 3-50 mm). Evaluation included audiometry, neurological examination, and serial imaging tests. A survey was conducted at the time of analysis. RESULT(S): Follow-up data were available for 45 patients and ranged from 1 to 7 years (median, 3.6 yr). In 43 patients (96%), tumor control (no radiographic progression or surgical resection) was observed. All 33 previously untreated patients had tumor control. Transient facial weakness, experienced in two patients (4%), had resolved completely within 6 months. No patient developed trigeminal neuropathy. Hearing was diminished from baseline in 12% of patients with useful hearing (Gardner-Robertson Class III). However, all patients with pretreatment hearing Gardner-Robertson Class I or II maintained testable hearing (Class I to III) at the most recent examination. CONCLUSION(S): Low-dose radiosurgery in this series provided comparable local control and decreased incidences of complications in relation to other reports. Additional follow-up will allow more definitive conclusions to be reached regarding the ultimate rates of tumor control and hearing preservation. Nevertheless, the current dose used for vestibular schwannomas at the University of Maryland Medical Center is 12.0 Gy to the tumor periphery.",Excluded
3197,"Proliferation and cell death of human glioblastoma cells after carbon-ion beam exposure: Morphologic and morphometric analyses Histological analyses of glioblastoma cells after carbon-ion exposure are still limited and ultrastructural characteristics have not been investigated in detail. Here we report the results of morphological and morphometric analyses of a human glioblastoma cell line, CGNH-89, after ionizing radiation to characterize the effect of a carbon-beam on glioblastoma cells. Using CGNH-89 cells exposed to 0-10 Gy of X-ray (140 kVp) or carbon-ions (18.3 MeV/nucleon, LET = 108 keV/mum), we performed conventional histology and immunocytochemistry with MIB-1 antibody, transmission electron microscopy, and computer-assisted, nuclear size measurements. CGNH-89 cells with a G to A transition in codon 280 in exon 8 of the TP53 gene had nuclei with pleomorphism, marked nuclear atypia and brisk mitotic activity. After carbon-ion and X-ray exposure, living cells showed decreased cell number, nuclear condensation, increased atypical mitotic figures, and a tendency of cytoplasmic enlargement at the level of light microscopy. The deviation of the nuclear area size increased during 48 h after irradiation, while the small cell fraction increased in 336 h. In glioblastoma cells of the control, 5 Gy carbon-beam, and 10 Gy carbon-beam, and MIB-1 labeling index decreased in 24 h (12%, 11%, 7%, respectively) but increased in 48 h (10%, 20%, 21%, respectively). Ultrastructurally, cellular enlargement seemed to depend on vacuolation, swelling of mitochondria, and increase of cellular organelles, such as the cytoskeleton and secondary lysosome. We could not observe apoptotic bodies in the CGNH-89 cells under any conditions. We conclude that carbon-ion irradiation induced cell death and senescence in a glioblastoma cell line with mutant TP53.

2496,"Differential intensity-dependent effects of magnetic stimulation on the longest neurites and shorter dendrites in neuroscreen-1 cells OBJECTIVE: Magnetic stimulation (MS) is a potential treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. This study investigates whether MS-regulated neuronal activity can translate to specific changes in neuronal arborization and thus regulate synaptic activity and function.APPROACH: To test our hypotheses, we examined the effects of MS on neurite growth of neuroscreen-1 (NS-1) cells over the pulse frequencies of 1, 5 and 10 Hz at field intensities controlled via machine output (MO). Cells were treated with either 30% or 40% MO. Due to the nature of circular MS coils, the center region of the gridded coverslip (zone 1) received minimal (~5%) electromagnetic current density while the remaining area (zone 2) received maximal (~95%) current density. Plated NS-1 cells were exposed to MS twice per day for three days and then evaluated for length and number of neurites and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).MAIN RESULTS: We show that MS dramatically affects the growth of the longest neurites (axon-like) but does not significantly affect the growth of shorter neurites (dendrite-like). Also, MS-induced changes in the longest neurite growth were most evident in zone 1, but not in zone 2. MS effects were intensity-dependent and were most evident in bolstering longest neurite outgrowth, best seen in the 10 Hz MS group. Furthermore, we found that MS-increased BDNF expression and secretion was also frequency-dependent. Taken together, our results show that MS exerts distinct effects when different frequencies and intensities are applied to the neuritic compartments (longest neurite versus shorter dendrite(s)) of NS-1 cells.SIGNIFICANCE: These findings support the concept that MS increases BDNF expression and signaling, which sculpts longest neurite arborization and connectivity by which neuronal activity is regulated. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MS is crucial for efficiently incorporating its use into potential therapeutic strategies.",Excluded
3355,"Recurrent breast cancer involving the brachial plexus identified by FDG PET/CT Purpose: Identifying malignant involvement of the brachial plexus in breast cancer patients is challenging from both a clinical and an imaging perspective. We evaluated the ability of PET/CT to detect malignant involvement of the brachial plexus in patients with a prior history of breast cancer. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients presenting with neuropathy and a prior history who underwent a FDG PET/CT scan from 9/01/05 to 9/01/09 was undertaken. Patients were included if the neurologic examination documented a regional pain syndrome, motor abnormalities or sensory deficits and PET/CT was ordered within 1 month of presentation. Brachial plexus involvement was confirmed by biopsy and/or resolved with cancer treatment. The location of brachial plexus involvement and other sites of disease identified on PET/CT were correlated to the pathologic results and clinical outcome. Result(s): Arm pain or peripheral neuropathy led to PT/CT evaluation in 81 patients (mean age 67.3+/-9.6) who had subsequently biopsy or clinical follow-up. FDG uptake indicative of recurrent malignancy was identified in the brachial plexus on PET/CT scans in 66 patients (81.5%). Forty-three patients had biopsy confirmation and the rest demonstrated resolution on PET/CT following treatment. The linear FDG uptake within the thicken plexus ranged from mild to intense (SUVmax= 2.1-12.3; mean 5.6). In 3 patients discontinuous plexus involvement was seen and confirmed by biopsy as skip lesions. In all but 5 patients, the brachial plexus was the only site of breast cancer recurrence identified on PET/CT. In the 15 PET/CT negative patients, 12 had positive MR. Biopsy or clinical follow-up determined that these 12 patients did not have brachial plexus disease but MR signal abnormalities were due to from post-treatment radiation or surgical changes.

2920,"The effects of the g-quadruplex ligand telomestatin to human brain tumor stem cell survival and growth Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the leading cause of death among primary brain tumors in adults and the current therapies have only palliative effect on prognosis of patients. Recently, stem cell-like cells in GBM (brain tumor stem-like cells; BTSC) have gained substantial attention as a potential therapeutic target. Hallmarks of BTSC include their self-renewal capacity and highly migratory potential. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of patient-derived BTSC with a G-quadruplex ligand, telomestatin (TMS), inhibits BTSC self-renewal and maintenance of their stem cell state, and induces their apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, both normal precursors and non-stem tumor cells from the matched samples are relatively resistant to TMS treatment. Treatment with a lower dose of TMS specifically inhibits BTSC migration into normal brain. Immunofluorescence in situ hybridization with TMS-treated GBM cells displays both telomeric and non-telomeric DNA damage in BTSC but not in non-stem tumor cells. cDNA microarray analysis identifies a proto-oncogene, c-Myb, as a target of TMS in BTSC, and the pharmacodynamic analysis with TMS-treated tumor-bearing mouse brains demonstrates reduction of c-Myb expression in tumors. An elevated c-Myb expression is found in surgical specimens of GBM compared to normal brain tissues. Lastly, TMS treatment of BTSC-derived mouse intracranial tumors reduces tumor sizes in vivo without any noticeable apoptotic cells in the normal brain, and a combined treatment of TMS with radiation or temozolomide results in additive inhibitory effects on GBM sphere growth in vitro. Collectively, these data indicate a potential avenue toward BTSC-directed therapeutic strategy using TMS via telomeric DNA damage and inhibition of c-Myb, which may offer a novel therapeutic approach for GBM.",Excluded
3116,"A rhodopsin in the brain functions in circadian photoentrainment in Drosophila Animals partition their daily activity rhythms through their internal circadian clocks, which are synchronized by oscillating day-night cycles of light. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster senses day-night cycles in part through rhodopsin-dependent light reception in the compound eye and photoreceptor cells in the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelet. A more noteworthy light entrainment pathway is mediated by central pacemaker neurons in the brain. The Drosophila circadian clock is extremely sensitive to light. However, the only known light sensor in pacemaker neurons, the flavoprotein cryptochrome (Cry), responds only to high levels of light in vitro. These observations indicate that there is an additional light-sensing pathway in fly pacemaker neurons. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized rhodopsin, Rh7, which contributes to circadian light entrainment by circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain. The pacemaker neurons respond to violet light, and this response depends on Rh7. Loss of either cry or rh7 caused minor defects in photoentrainment, whereas loss of both caused profound impairment. The circadian photoresponse to constant light was impaired in rh7 mutant flies, especially under dim light. The demonstration that Rh7 functions in circadian pacemaker neurons represents, to our knowledge, the first role for an opsin in the central brain.",Excluded

However, the use of neurocognitive end points in clinical trials for patients with CNS tumors is in its infancy, so that long-term outcomes are difficult to predict and the ability to determine the effects of different agents and treatment approaches is scant.

2734,"Significant reduction of beta-amyloid in the CNS following external radiation: Implications for treatment in alzheimer's disease Purpose/Objective(s): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent form of dementia in the elderly population, is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau protein tangles. These events are especially prevalent in the hippocampus region which is responsible for long term memory. In this animal study, we investigated if cranial X-irradiation could reduce the formation of Ab plaques as a potential novel clinical treatment for Alzheimer's disease, the rationale being that external beam radiotherapy has been used previously as an effective clinical treatment for systemic amyloidosis. Materials/Methods: A transgenic mouse model was used that expresses a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) both directed to CNS neurons. Both mutations are associated with early-onset AD. Radiation treatments were either a single dose (5 Gy, 10 Gy or 15 Gy) or daily fractionation (1 Gy, 2 Gy) to a dose of 10 Gy to a single side of the head. Brains were harvested at various times post-irradiation (2-8 wks) and coronal sections were evaluated for H&E and antibody specific immunohistochemistry to detect beta-amyloid plaques and assess radiation response, staining for IL1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, microglia cells (CD11b) and activated microglia cells (CD68). Result(s): Radiation treatments were well-tolerated. H&E stained tissue sections indicated no evidence of a significant decrease in cell density (Nissl staining) and no compelling evidence of significant cellular necrosis. No signs of devitalization, malacia or spongiosus or classic acute or chronic inflammatory features were evident. The number and size of beta-amyloid plaques were compared between the irradiated and shielded halves of the brain. The average number of plaques in the unirradiated brain increased with age, the values for 32, 34 and 38 week old animals were 43.9 (SD +/- 17.6; n = 9), 61.7 (SD +/- 19.8, n = 9) and 109 (SD +/- 26.9, n = 9) respectively. Radiation treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction of plaques throughout the brain (paired t-test p = 0.002).This effect was more significant in the hippocampus region (p = 0.0004). At 4 weeks post-treatment 5, 10 and 15 Gy caused a 71 +/- 3%, 87 +/- 24%, 92 +/- 34% reduction in plaque incidence in the hippocampus. The greatest reductions were noted at longer times post-treatment. TGF-beta staining was restricted to the irradiated side of the brain, little or no site-specific staining of IL1 or TNF-alpha was seen. A trend was evident of activated microglia in the irradiated brain.

The electron microscopic investigation of the repeatedly exposed retinas revealed degenerative changes in the retinal neurons. The neurons appeared depleted of their cytoplasmic constituents and often contained phago-lysosomal structures with myelin bodies. There were many degenerating synaptic boutons. The glial cells displayed reactive changes. These ultrastructural changes could not be demonstrated by the other methods used. A single microwave exposure, followed by an induced 70--100% blood-pressure increase, did not enhance blood-retina barrier permeability to tracers.

Majority cancer type was non-small cell lung cancer(55%)and squamous cell cancer(29%). 60% patients were stage 4 and 40% patients were combined stages 1-3. 50% had local lung metastasis followed by 19%, 18% and 11% brain, bone and liver metastasis, respectively. Besides chemotherapy,24% had prior surgery and 45% had radiation for treatment.18% were admitted due to cancer progression (CP), 64% due to reversible cancer complications (RCC), and 19 % due to therapy complications (TC). Most common admitting diagnoses were: hypoxic respiratory failure (32, 40%) and sepsis (19,24%). The median ICU length of stay was 4 days. In ICU, 35 patients (44%) had ventilator dependent respiratory failure (VDRF), 42 (52%) had sepsis, 46 (57%) had renal failure (RF), 11 (14%) had liver failure(LF), 10 (12%) had pancytopenia. 18 patients (22%) were DNR at ICU admission and 62 (78%) were full code. Only 6 patients (7.5%) had palliative goals of care before ICU admission. In-hospital mortality (IHM) was 19 patients (24%) overall, and highest in those with cardiac failure(50%, p = .008),VDRF(43%,p = 0.002),followed by sepsis (40.4%,p = 0.004), and pancytopenia 40%,p = 0.16). IHM was 21% in pts with CP, 25% in patients with a RCC and 20% in pts with a TC. After discharge, 35 patients (58.3%) went back on Rx and 23 (38.3%) chose hospice. After discharge, 18% were dead at 30 days, 28% at 90-days. Only 49% had more than one year survival. Conclusion(s): Considering high mortality in lung cancer patients in MICU(as shown by our study), it is imperative to address goals of care/end of life discussion early on.",Excluded
3093,"Biopsy of enlarging lesions after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases frequently reveals radiation necrosis Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers excellent local control for brain metastases (BM) with low rates of toxicity. Radiation necrosis (RN) may occur after treatment and is challenging to distinguish from local recurrence (LR). We evaluated enlarging brain lesions following SRS that were subsequently biopsied to differentiate RN versus LR.Methods: This study reviewed patients receiving SRS for BM between 2008 and 2012 who underwent a biopsy for suspicion of RN versus LR on MRI. Data collection included demographics, radiation parameters, imaging findings, and post-biopsy pathology. Kaplan-Meier methods determined overall survival. Fisher's exact test assessed for association between lesion biopsy result and variables of interest.Results: Thirty-four patients with 35 biopsied BM were included. Lesions were biopsied a median of 8.8 months after SRS. Most patients had primary lung cancer (11; 31.4%). Eleven (31.4%) biopsies were positive for LR and 24 (68.6%) showed RN only. Median overall survival was longer for patients with RN (31.0 mo) than for patients with LR (14.5 mo; P = 0.135). Time from SRS to biopsy was significantly different between RN and LR groups; 10 lesions (52.5%) biopsied <=9 months after SRS showed LR, whereas 1 lesion (6.3%) biopsied >9 months after SRS showed LR (P = 0.004). For 16 (65.7%) lesions, management was changed or directed by the biopsy results.Conclusions: Stereotactic biopsy for accessible enlarging lesions after SRS appears diagnostically valuable in patients with few lesions and changes clinical management. RN should be suspected in patients with an enlarging lesion more than 9 months post-SRS.",Excluded
2611,"The effect of exposure to 60Co accelerated electrons and gamma quanta on the activity of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes in the rat brain. [Russian] In experiments with 112 male Wistar rats it was shown that accelerated electrons (85 Gy) caused a significant increase in activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDG) by 15.8% and lactate dehydrogenase (LDG) by 17.0%, and a decrease in activities of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) by 10.6 and 7.8% respectively within the sensorimotor region of the cerebral cortex immediately after irradiation. Activity of SDG and MAO decreased (by 16.4% and 7.8% respectively) in the caudate nucleus over the same period of time. An increase in the accelerated electron dose from 85 to 500 Gy did not change the direction and the rate of the radiation response of the enzymes. Exposure of rats to 60Co gamma quanta (75 Gy) increased SDG and LDG activity (by 21.4 and 17.3% respectively) within the sensorimotor cortex as late as 10 min after irradiation.

They are highly sensitive to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation and also fail to demonstrate the normal inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with this type of DNA-damaging agent. Additionally, a number of ataxia-telangiectasia lymphoblastoid lines have been shown to have an unusual regulation of the cellular actin levels. However, the primary lesion causing ataxia-telangiectasia is unknown. In this paper we report an altered cellular morphology in three ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblast lines, but not in a number of control fibroblast lines. Investigation of the cytoskeleton using antibodies against certain cytoskeletal proteins revealed a difference in the microfilament pattern from ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblasts compared to controls. Ataxia fibroblasts showed a microfilament stress fiber pattern that appeared to have a more well defined and abundant array of stress fibers than control fibroblasts. In contrast, no differences were observed in the microtubule array, nor in the vinculin patterns between any of the cell lines. In addition to the differences in the microfilament patterns, ataxia-telangiectasia fibroblasts differed in their ability to recover from microfilament disruption by dimethyl sulfoxide. Control fibroblasts returned to a normal cellular state in a shorter time compared to ataxia fibroblasts, as judged by indirect immunofluorescence using antiactin. These results provide further evidence for a cytoskeletal anomaly in ataxia-telangiectasia.",Excluded

Here we present new data on the biophysical properties of an integrin-targeted plasmid DNA (LID) formulation.MATERIAL/METHODS: Two plasmids (D), pEGFP (4.7 kb) and pCI-luc (5.7 kb), were mixed with a synthetic a5b1 integrin-targeted peptide (I), [K]16 GACRRETAWACG, in the presence of a cationic liposome (L), Lipofectin, composed of DOTMA and DOPE to form LID complexes. The physical properties of the complexes were measured using a variety of techniques including dynamic light scattering and fluorescence methods. The in vitro gene delivery to neuroblastoma cells with LID complexes was also assessed.RESULTS: We demonstrate the effects of complex size and charge ratio on in vitro transfection of mouse (Neuro-2A) and human (IMR-32) neuroblastoma cells. We report a significant increase in the level of luciferase and green fluorescent protein expression when transfection is performed in buffers of physiological ionic strength and hypothesise that the enhancement in transfection is caused by an increase in the size of the complexes observed during mixing and maturation.CONCLUSIONS: Cell transfection is also shown to be dependent on complex size and charge ratio, with large complexes prepared at charge ratios above 4.0 demonstrating efficient transfection.",Excluded

Such simulations exhibit a few stable conformations, which also have been identified experimentally. The simulations provide the possibility to perform cluster analysis in the space defined by potentially pharmacophoric measures such as dihedral angles, side-chain orientation, etc. By analyzing the statistics of the resulting clusters, the probability distribution of the side-chain conformations may be determined. These probabilities allow us to predict the selectivity of [Leu]enkephalin and [Met]enkephalin to the known mu- and delta-type opiate receptors to which they bind as agonists. Other plausible consequences of these probability distributions are discussed in relation to the way in which they may influence the dynamics of the synapse.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): From 1994 to 2000, 17 patients who had small recurrent breast carcinomas after initially undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT), which included postoperative radiation therapy, were treated with local tumor excision and PDR brachytherapy. Recurrences occurred at a median time of 50 months (range, 11-208 months) after primary treatment. Eight patients underwent a combination of PDR brachytherapy (total dose range, 12.5-28.0 Gy) and external-beam radiation therapy (EBT) (total dose range, 12-30 Gy). Nine patients underwent radiation therapy with 40.2-50.0-Gy PDR brachytherapy only. The prescribed radiation dose was 0.5-1.0 Gy per pulse. Patients were examined for local tumor control and treatment-related side effects. Result(s): Twelve of 17 patients had no local tumor at a median follow-up time of 59 months (range, 20-84 months); two of these patients showed signs of having distant disease. One patient died after a cerebral stroke without evidence of tumor. Four women treated with combined EBT and brachytherapy had secondary local tumor recurrences 4, 8, 8, and 11 months after therapy and had to undergo mastectomy. Despite having undergone radiation therapy previously, patients had side effects limited to moderate (grade 1-2) fibrosis. Conclusion(s): Local tumor excision combined with PDR brachytherapy for small local-regional tumor recurrences after primary BCT is feasible and well tolerated and might obviate mastectomy.

2952,"Regulation of prostaglandin E2 synthesis after brain irradiation PURPOSE: A local tissue reaction, termed neuroinflammation, occurs after irradiation of brain tissue. Previous work suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was important for changes in gene expression associated with neuroinflammation as well as increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels seen after radiation treatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: To begin to determine the contributions of other enzymes involved in PGE2 production, we examined protein levels of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as 2 PGE synthases (membrane and cytosolic PGES) 4 h after 35 Gy single dose irradiation to the brains of C3HeN mice. We also evaluated the effects of specific COX inhibitors on PGE2 production and PGES expression.RESULTS: As expected, COX-2 expression increased after radiation exposure. Brain irradiation also increased tissue protein levels for both PGES isoforms. Specific COX-2 inhibition with NS398 lowered brain PGE2 levels by about 60%. Surprisingly, COX-1 inhibition with SC560 completely prevented the elevation of PGE2 seen after irradiation. Interestingly, NS398 reduced the membrane-associated PGES isoform, whereas SC560 treatment lowered cytosolic isoform levels below those seen in unirradiated controls.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that both cyclooxygenases contribute to PGE2 production in irradiated brain and reveal dependence of PGES isoforms expression on specific cyclooxygenase activities.",Included
2404,"Acute remapping within the motor system induced by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of human primary motor cortex (M1) changes cortical excitability at the site of stimulation and at distant sites without affecting simple motor performance. The aim of this study was to explore how rTMS changes regional excitability and how the motor system compensates for these changes. Using functional brain imaging, activation was mapped at rest and during freely selected finger movements after 30 min of 1 Hz rTMS. rTMS increased synaptic activity in the stimulated left M1 and induced widespread changes in activity throughout areas engaged by the task. In particular, movement-related activity in the premotor cortex of the nonstimulated hemisphere increased after 1 Hz rTMS. Analyses of effective connectivity confirmed that the stimulated part of M1 became less responsive to input from premotor and mesial motor areas. Conversely, after rTMS our results were consistent with increased coupling between an inferomedial portion of left M1 and anterior motor areas. These results are important for three reasons. First, they show changes in motor excitability to central inputs from other cortical areas (as opposed to peripheral or exogenous inputs used in previous studies). Second, they suggest that maintenance of task performance may involve activation of premotor areas contralateral to the site of rTMS, similar to that seen in stroke patients. Third, changes in motor activations at the site of rTMS suggest an rTMS-induced remodeling of motor representations during movement. This remapping may provide a neural substrate for acute compensatory plasticity of the motor system in response to focal lesions such as stroke.",Excluded

We investigated multiple pretreatment PET metrics, including SUV<inf>max</inf>, mean SUV (SUV<inf>mean</inf>), total lesion glycolysis, and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in LS-SCLC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and correlated them with survival and disease control outcomes. Patients and Methods All patients received platinum-based chemotherapy and a median radiation dose of 45 Gy. Kaplan-Meier and competing-risks analyses were performed to assess the prognostic value of PET metrics with respect to overall survival (OS), distant failure (DF), disease-free survival (DFS), and locoregional failure (LRF). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to account for the effect of other clinical factors on outcomes. Results A total of 120 patients with LS-SCLC had analyzable pre-CRT PET/CTs. The median follow up was 34 months. Median OS was 26.9 months. OS was 53.2% at 2 years and 33.1% at 5 years. SUV<inf>max</inf>, SUV<inf>mean</inf>, MTV, and total lesion glycolysis of the primary tumor were not significantly associated with OS, LRF, and DFS on univariate analysis. MTV was significantly associated with DF (P =.024) on univariate but not multivariate analysis. Conclusion This is the largest reported series to date evaluating the prognostic value of baseline PET metrics in LS-SCLC. Neither SUV<inf>max</inf> nor other analyzed PET metrics demonstrated significant correlation with OS or LRF. MTV was correlated with DF and DFS, but this association was no longer significant after adjustment for other clinical factors. This analysis suggests that pretreatment PET scans, even with the use of advanced metrics, do not have independent prognostic value for outcomes in LS-SCLC patients after CRT.

3295,"Combined endoscopic endonasal surgery and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (fSRS) for complex cranial base tumors-early clinical outcomes Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has been shown to be a feasible approach to cranial base tumors while reducing post-operative morbidity. Using the endoscopic endonasal approach alone or in combination with open approaches may provide advantages over conventional approaches. However, the balance between maximal resection and minimal injury to neurovascular structures frequently precludes gross total resection (GTR). Consequently, adjuvant radiation therapy may be an important option to improve local control (LC) of residual disease. In this retrospective series, we report clinical outcomes, morbidity, and LC of 40 patients with cranial base tumors treated with EES +/- combined open approach followed by fSRS (CyberKnife, Accuray Inc.). 26 patients had benign disease, 7 had newly diagnosed malignant disease, and 7 had previously resected malignant disease. Surgical outcomes were evaluable in all patients. LC after fSRS was evaluable in 39 patients and defined as no evidence of regrowth by MRI, CT, & physical examination. GTR was achieved in 12/40. Median post-operative length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. In multivariable analysis controlling for anatomic location and malignant histology, post-operative complications (n = 10) were significantly associated with patients having combined open and EES (p < 0.01, OR = 16.9). SRS was delivered in 1-5 sessions to a median marginal dose of 24.9 Gy. Median follow-up was 24.7 months (range, 1.5 to 61 months). LC was achieved in 89.7% (35/39) of evaluable patients. LC was achieved in 11/12 patients who had GTR. Median progression-free survival was 19.7 months (21.0 months for benign tumors (n = 26), 5.8 months for previously resected malignant disease (n = 7), and 21.2 months for newly diagnosed malignant disease (n = 7). Of the 31 patients who had symptomatic disease at presentation, 18 (58%) reported complete symptom resolution, 9 partial, and 4 no improvement. One patient who received two prior courses of radiation therapy developed osteosclerosis (grade III). Other adverse events were erythema (grade I, n = 5), nausea (grade II, n = 2), conjunctivitis (grade II, n = 1). EES followed by fSRS is a safe and effective management strategy for selected cranial base tumors. EES combined with an open surgical approach may result in increased complications. However, initial follow-up offers encouraging results indicating shorter time to recovery, acceptable LC rates compared to conventional approaches, and similar median time to progression for benign and newly diagnosed malignant disease.",Excluded
3321,"Long-Term Deficits in Behavior Performances Caused by Low- and High-Linear Energy Transfer Radiation Efforts to protect astronauts from harmful galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) require a better understanding of the effects of GCR on human health. In particular, little is known about the lasting effects of GCR on the central nervous system (CNS), which may lead to behavior performance deficits. Previous studies have shown that high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in rodents leads to short-term declines in a variety of behavior tests. However, the lasting impact of low-, medium- and high-LET radiation on behavior are not fully defined. Therefore, in this study C57BL/6 male mice were irradiated with 100 or 250 cGy of gamma rays (LET ~0.3 KeV/mum), 10 or 100 cGy of <sup>1</sup>H at 1,000 MeV/n (LET ~0.2 KeV/mum), <sup>28</sup>Si at 300 MeV/n (LET ~69 KeV/mum) or <sup>56</sup>Fe at 600 MeV/n (LET of ~180 KeV/mum), and behavior metrics were collected at 5 and 9 months postirradiation to analyze differences among radiation qualities and doses. A significant dose effect was observed on recognition memory and activity levels measured 9 months postirradiation, regardless of radiation source. In contrast, we observed that each ion species had a distinct effect on anxiety, motor coordination and spatial memory at extended time points. Although <sup>28</sup>Si and <sup>56</sup>Fe are both regarded as high-LET particles, they were shown to have different detrimental effects on behavior. In summary, our findings suggest that GCR not only affects the CNS in the short term, but also has lasting damaging effects on the CNS that can cause sustained declines in behavior performance.",Included

The overall local treatment paradigm of brain metastases, which includes whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), continues to evolve. Local therapies play an important role in the management of brain metastases. The choice of local therapy depends on factors that involve the patient (performance status, expected survival, and age), the prior treatment history, and the tumor (type and subtype, number, size, location of metastases, and extracranial disease status). Multidisciplinary collaboration is required to facilitate an individualized plan to improve the outcome of disease in patients with this life-limiting complication. There has been concern about the neurocognitive effects of WBRT. A number of approaches that mitigate cognitive dysfunction, such as pharmacologic intervention (memantine) or a hippocampal-sparing strategy, have been studied in a prospective manner with WBRT. Although there has been an increase in the use of SRS in the management of brain metastases in recent years, WBRT retains an important therapeutic role.",Excluded
2954,"Radiation therapy for the treatment of tumours in small companion animals Radiation is becoming widely available to treat tumours in veterinary patients. Orthovoltage machines capable of delivering low energy external beam radiation are less versatile than linear accelerators and cobalt-60 machines that deliver megavoltage radiation. In addition, electron beam capabilities that are available with some linear accelerators allow more targeted treatment in smaller patients. Acute effects of radiation are to be expected, but in nearly all cases such side effects resolve without limiting protocols. In contrast, late effects of radiation are dose limiting and are more likely with higher doses per treatment fraction. Protocols that use smaller doses per fraction have a lower risk of late effects thereby allowing higher total doses to be delivered which leads to higher tumour control rates. It is possible to provide long-term tumour control in cats and dogs using radiation therapy, particularly for mast cell tumours, soft tissue sarcomas, oral tumours and brain tumours in dogs and soft tissue sarcomas and skin tumours in cats. Individualization of treatments for tumours based on tumour staging and proliferative fraction should be considered, rather than making blanket assumptions about the behaviour of histologically determined tumour types. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

3596,"Normal intima-media thickness on carotid ultrasound reliably excludes an ischemic cause of cardiomyopathy BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Patients with ischemia as the cause of LVSD may warrant revascularization. Angiography is the most accurate method of CAD diagnosis but is invasive, expensive, and associated with some risk. Noninvasive imaging for CAD often involves expensive equipment, radiation exposure, medication, and/or contrast administration. Carotid ultrasound with measurement of intima-media thickness (IMT) is safe and inexpensive. Carotid IMT is well correlated with the presence of CAD. We assessed the accuracy of carotid ultrasound for identification of CAD as a potential etiology of LVSD.METHODS: Patients with LVSD (ejection fraction < or =40%) of uncertain etiology referred for angiography underwent carotid ultrasound. Patients with history of myocardial infarction were excluded. Two experienced cardiologists blinded to CAD status determined common carotid artery (CCA) IMT and plaque. Significant CAD was defined as > or =50% stenosis of any major artery. Ischemic LVSD was defined as (1) left main and/or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery > or =75% or (2) > or =2 major arteries with > or =75% stenosis.RESULTS: Mean ejection fraction was 27% +/- 10% in 150 patients. Significant CAD was found in 64 (42.7%) and ischemic LVSD in 40 (26.7%). Carotid plaque was seen in 95 (63.3%). Mean CCA IMT was > or =0.9 mm in 69 (46.0%). The combination of mean CCA IMT <0.9 mm and no plaque had negative predictive value for ischemic LVSD of 98%.CONCLUSIONS: Carotid ultrasound with IMT measurement is a valuable screening tool for excluding an ischemic etiology of LVSD when CAD is suspected.",Excluded
2726,"Sustained ocular venous fluid shift during spaceflight may contribute to optic disc edema Purpose : The Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) is characterized by the development of optic disc edema, chorioretinal folds, globe flattening, and/or hyperopic shifts in astronauts during 6-month missions on the International Space Station (ISS). We hypothesize that a weightlessness-induced chronic headward fluid shift within the venous system contributes to these ocular changes. Methods : Astronauts (n=10) were studied before flight (seated and supine posture) and ~150 days into a 6-month mission on the ISS. Ocular and vascular measures included optical coherence tomography (OCT; Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering) assessments of sub-macular choroid thickness and peripapillary total retinal thickness (TRT; segmented from Bruch's membrane to the internal limiting membrane); ultrasound-derived internal jugular vein (IJV) cross-sectional area (GE VividQ) and non-invasive IJV pressure (Veinpress); and intraocular pressure (IOP; iCare pro pre-flight and TonoPen in-flight). Repeatedmeasures ANOVA with Tukey's post-test was used to determine the mean change between conditions; data are presented as group mean +/- standard deviation. Results : The mean IJV area increased from 9 +/- 6 mm<sup>2</sup> in the seated position to 83 +/- 27 mm<sup>2</sup> in the supine position on Earth and to 64 +/- 31 mm<sup>2</sup> during spaceflight (P<.001). Similarly, mean IJV pressure increased from 4.3 +/- 1.6 mmHg in the seated position to 16.6 +/- 5.6 mmHg in the supine position on Earth and to 14.4 +/- 5.3 mmHg in-flight (P<.001). No significant changes in sub-macular choroid thickness or TRT were detected during the acute preflight posture change, however after 150 days of weightlessness, choroid thickness increased by 50 +/- 37 mum (P<.05) and TRT increased by 26 +/- 32 mum (P=.05) relative to preflight seated values. IOP remained within a normal range in weightlessness, averaging 15.4 +/- 2.1 mmHg after 150 days of spaceflight, compared to 14.8 +/- 2.7 mmHg and 15 +/- 1.1 mmHg pre-flight in the seated and supine positions, respectively. Conclusions : Although a transient posture-induced venous fluid shift has no effect on choroidal or retinal thickness, a sustained, unrelenting cephalad fluid shift during spaceflight results in increased choroidal and retinal thickness. These data suggest that altered venous hemodynamics during spaceflight may contribute to SANS.",Excluded

[French] Purpose. - To identify SF2 as a prognostic factor of late complications from radiosurgery in patients treated for AVM. Patients and Methods. - Five patients with AVM treated in three canadian institutions and who suffered clinically significant neurological sequelaes secondary to radiosurgery were identified. Their fibroblasts were cultured and their radiation sensitivity tested to determine the SF2 for each patient. Results. - Patients who developed a neurological complication from radionecrosis, secondary to radiosurgery had an SF2 different than the two control patients with AVM and no complications and also from a group of five cancer patients without late radiation complications (P = 0.005). Conclusion. - Radiosurgery is an elective procedure. The identification of a subgroup of patients who are radiosensitive and at a higher risk of radiation induced complications can allow the treatment team to reduce the risk of such complications.

2773,"Effects of Radiotherapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma: a retrospective analysis of a Single Institution BACKGROUND: Palliative irradiation of osteolytic lesions is a considerable component in the treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of irradiation in these patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 153 patients with multiple myeloma who were admitted to our department between 1989 and 2013. According to the staging system of Durie & Salmon 116 patients were classified as stage III. 107/153 patients were treated with radiotherapy of at least one and up to 6 bony lesions at different times. In order to evaluate the effect of local radiotherapy on pain relief and bone recalcification a uni- and multivariate analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model to correct for multiple measurements. Complete information on dose, fractionation and volume of radiotherapy was available from 81 patients treated in 136 target volumes for pain relief, and from 69 patients treated in 108 target volumes for recalcification. Total radiation doses varied between 8 Gy to 50 Gy (median dose 25 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions, 5 times a week).RESULTS: Radiotherapy resulted in complete local pain relief in 31% and partial local pain relief in 54% of the patients. In the univariate analysis, higher total radiation doses (p = 0.023) and higher age (p = 0.014) at the time of radiotherapy were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of pain relief, whereas no significant association was detected for concurrent systemic treatment, type and stage of myeloma and location of bone lesions. The same variables were independent predictors for pain relief in the multivariate analysis. Recalcification was observed in 48% of irradiated bone lesions. In the uni- and multivariate analysis higher radiation doses were significantly associated (p = 0.048) with an increased likelihood of recalcification. Side effects of radiotherapy were generally mild.CONCLUSIONS: Higher total biological radiation doses were associated with better pain relief and recalcification in this retrospective evaluation of multiple myeloma patients. In addition, in the elderly the therapeutic measures appear to develop a better analgesic effect.",Included
2637,"Characterization of a new rat model of experimental combined neurotrauma Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is present in two-thirds of patients with multiple injuries and in one-third combined with injuries of the extremities. Studies on interactive effects between central and peripheral injuries are scarce due to the absence of clinically relevant models. To meet the demand for ""more-hit"" models, an experimental model of combined neurotrauma (CNT) incorporating a standardized TBI via lateral fluid percussion (LFP) together with a peripheral bone fracture, i.e., tibia fracture, is introduced. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to four experimental groups: controls (n = 10), animals with TBI (n = 30), animals with tibia fracture (n = 30), and animals with CNT (n = 30). Morphological aspects of brain and bone injury were analyzed via standard histopathological procedures and x-ray. Trauma-induced neuromotor dysfunction was assessed using a standardized neuroscore. For interactive effects between injuries, we studied the extent and temporal pattern of circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels via immunoassay and callus formation at fracture sites by means of microradiography. LFP produced an ipsilateral lesion with cortical contusion, hemorrhage, mass shift, and neuronal cell loss (adjacent cortex and hippocampus CA-2/-3), along with contralateral neuromotor dysfunction. X-rays confirmed complete fractures in the middle of the bone shaft. The type of injury (P < 0.001) and time (P = 0.022) were significantly associated with increased IL-6 levels. CNT produced the highest IL-6 plasma levels with a maximum peak at 6 h after trauma (P < 0.001). Similarly, callus formation at fracture sites in CNT was significantly increased versus fracture only (P < 0,01). The CNT model mimics a variety of clinically relevant features known from human multiple injury, including TBI, and offers novel approaches for investigation of interactive mechanisms and therapeutic approaches.",Excluded
2878,"Association Between Radiation Necrosis and Tumor Biology After Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastasis BACKGROUND: The primary dose-limiting toxicity of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is radiation necrosis (RN), which occurs after approximately 5% to 10% of treatments. This adverse event may worsen neurologic deficits, increase the frequency and cost of imaging, and necessitate prolonged treatment with steroids or antiangiogenic agents. Previous investigations have primarily identified lesion size and dosimetric constraints as risk factors for RN in small populations. We hypothesized that disease histology, receptor status, and mutational status are associated with RN.METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients presenting with brain metastasis between 1997 and 2015 who underwent SRS and subsequent radiographic follow-up at a single tertiary-care institution were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of radiographic RN. Multivariate competing risks regression was used to identify biological risk factors for RN.RESULTS: 1939 patients (5747 lesions) were eligible for inclusion; 285 patients (15%) experienced radiographic RN after the treatment of 427 (7%) lesions. After SRS, the median time to RN was 7.6 months. After multivariate analysis, graded prognostic assessment, renal pathology, lesion diameter, and the heterogeneity index remained independently predictive of RN in the pooled cohort. In subset analyses of individual pathologies, HER2-amplified status (hazard ratio [HR] 2.05, P=.02), BRAF V600+ mutational status (HR 0.33, P=.04), lung adenocarcinoma histology (HR 1.89, P=.04), and ALK rearrangement (HR 6.36, P<.01) were also associated with RN.CONCLUSIONS: In the present investigation constituting the largest series of RN, several novel risk factors were identified, including renal histology, lung adenocarcinoma histology, HER2 amplification, and ALK/BRAF mutational status. These risk factors may be used to guide clinical trial design incorporating biological risk stratification or dose escalation. Future studies determining the optimal timing of targeted therapies are warranted to further define the risk of RN.",Excluded
3360,"ADAM23: Biomarker for nonmelanoma skin cancer disease progression The ADAMs (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) comprise a family of multidomain transmembrane and secreted proteins involved in cytokine and growth factor release, proteolysis and cell adhesion. Multiple family members have been shown to play a role in cancer formation and disease progression. Decreased ADAM23 expression has been demonstrated in human breast, colon, gastric, head and neck, brain and pancreatic cancers and is believed to be associated with a more malignant or metastatic phenotype. Substantially more than 1 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) occur annually in the United States according to the American Cancer Society. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the two major types of NMSC and most are related to chronic sun exposure. We have demonstrated by microarray analysis that ADAM23 expression is decreased in human keratinocytes chronically irradiated with a solar-simulated light source. Using a human SCC skin carcinogenesis model, we have demonstrated that decreased ADAM23 expression correlates with disease progression. Preliminary immunohistochemical analysis of human SCC samples also demonstrates decreased ADAM23 expression. We believe that ADAM23 may serve as a biomarker of human skin SCC disease progression. This may be important for earlier detection and for the possible development of targeted therapy that may serve as an alternative to potentially disfiguring surgical treatment.",Excluded

Limnological parameters revealed no significant changes throughout the period of experimentation which were measured by PCS Testr 35 Multi-Parameter. Morphometric analysis revealed that during the extended exposure period of 10 days the spawn size and weight were reduced as analysed through Specific Growth Rate (SGR). SGR values in terms of weight for 5 and 10 days under 3 time-frames were 17.12%, 12.52%, 11.46% and 9.09%, 6.43%, 6.09% respectively, which revealed a declined trend along with the exposure days. In the skin of C. batrachus, the compact regular orientation of the stratified epithelial cells and mucous cells became distorted and the microridges and double-ridged structures showed destruction and fragmentations. The body striations and microfolds became shrinked and swollen and finally degenerated to form a mass. The distribution of mucous cells throughout the epidermis was disorganised and releasing secretory contents on the surface through small pores. Appearance of huge quantity of biogenic semi-hexagonal plate like crystals (guanine platelets) on the skin surface of the body was the most significant observations during UV-B radiation. In the developmental phases the eyeball showed shrinkage loosing normal regular concave structure and to become a dome-shaped one. The supportive connective infoldings became loosened. The choroid coat displayed deformities and the iris deformed the pupil. The fibroblast on the epithelium and melanocytes depicted dispersed arrangement. The pairs of ventral barbels near the mouth depicted the presence of taste buds that became severely damaged exposing the sensory as well as neuroepithelial cells. Compact regular arrangement of the SECs was completely destroyed leaving long and deep channels inbetween them; the disintegrated concentric MRs also showed a mass.",Excluded

2706,"Robotics in keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery: A critical review of existing systems and proposed specifications for new robotic platforms BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in image guidance, endoscopy, and tube-shaft instruments have allowed for the further development of keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery, utilizing smaller craniotomies and minimizing exposure and manipulation of unaffected brain tissue. Although such approaches offer the possibility of shorter operating times, reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved longterm outcomes, the technical skills required to perform such surgery are inevitably greater than for traditional open surgical techniques, and they have not been widely adopted by neurosurgeons. Surgical robotics, which has the ability to improve visualization and increase dexterity, therefore has the potential to enhance surgical performance. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the role of surgical robots in keyhole transcranial endoscopeassisted microsurgery. METHOD(S): The technical challenges faced by surgeons utilizing keyhole craniotomies were reviewed, and a thorough appraisal of presently available robotic systems was performed. RESULT(S): Surgical robotic systems have the potential to incorporate advances in augmented reality, stereoendoscopy, and jointed-wrist instruments, and therefore to significantly impact the field of keyhole neurosurgery. To date, over 30 robotic systems have been applied to neurosurgical procedures. The vast majority of these robots are best described as supervisory controlled, and are designed for stereotactic or image-guided surgery. Few telesurgical robots are suitable for keyhole neurosurgical approaches, and none are in widespread clinical use in the field. CONCLUSION(S): New robotic platforms in minimally invasive neurosurgery must possess clear and unambiguous advantages over conventional approaches if they are to achieve significant clinical penetration.

We sought to test the reliability of these TMS measurements.METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were tested twice over a two-week period using TMS to determine motor threshold, map topography, and stimulus-response curves for first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB), extensor digitorum communis (EDC), and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles.RESULTS: We found moderate to good test-retest reliability TMS measurements of motor threshold (ICC=0.90-0.97), map area (ICC=0.63-0.86) and location (ICC=0.69-0.86), and stimulus-response curves (ICC=0.60-0.83).CONCLUSIONS: TMS assessments of motor representation size, location, and excitability are generally reliable measures, although their reliability may vary according to the muscle under investigation.SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that TMS measurements of motor cortex function are reliable enough to be potentially useful in investigation of motor system plasticity.",Excluded
3188,"Effect of jump exercise training on long-term head-down bed rest-induced cerebral blood flow responses in arteries and veins New Findings: What is the central question of this study? What is the effect of an exercise countermeasure on microgravity-induced change in cerebral blood flow? What is the main finding and its importance? Jump exercise training as a countermeasure did not modify the heterogeneous cerebral blood flow response to head-down bed rest, suggesting that this method is effective in preventing cardiovascular system deconditioning but is not good for cerebral haemodynamics. Abstract: This study aimed to examine the effect of an exercise countermeasure on cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to long-term -6degree head-down bed rest (HDBR) in all cerebral arteries and veins. Twenty male volunteers were exposed to HDBR for 60 days with (training group, n = 10) or without (control group, n = 10) jump exercise training as a countermeasure to spaceflight. The blood flow in the neck conduit arteries (internal carotid and vertebral artery; ICA and VA) and veins (internal jugular and vertebral veins; IJV and VV) was measured, using ultrasonography before (baseline) HDBR, on the 30th and 57th day of HDBR. Long-term HDBR causes a heterogeneous CBF response between the anterior and the posterior brain or between arteries and veins. Long-term HDBR decreased anterior cerebral arterial and venous blood flow, while posterior cerebral arterial and venous blood flows were well maintained. However, exercise jump training did not change each arterial and venous CBF responses to HDBR (control vs. training; ICA, P = 0.643; VA, P = 0.542; external carotid artery, P = 0.644; IJV, P = 0.980; VV, P = 0.999). These findings suggest that jump exercise training did not modify the heterogeneous CBF response to long-term HDBR. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

2399,"Quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow velocity and intracellular motility using dynamic light scattering-optical coherence tomography This paper describes a novel optical method for label-free quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracellular motility (IM) in the rodent cerebral cortex. This method is based on a technique that integrates dynamic light scattering (DLS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), named DLS-OCT. The technique measures both the axial and transverse velocities of CBF, whereas conventional Doppler OCT measures only the axial one. In addition, the technique produces a three-dimensional map of the diffusion coefficient quantifying nontranslational motions. In the DLS-OCT diffusion map, we observed high-diffusion spots, whose locations highly correspond to neuronal cell bodies and whose diffusion coefficient agreed with that of the motion of intracellular organelles reported in vitro in the literature. Therefore, the present method has enabled, for the first time to our knowledge, label-free imaging of the diffusion-like motion of intracellular organelles in vivo. As an example application, we used the method to monitor CBF and IM during a brief ischemic stroke, where we observed an induced persistent reduction in IM despite the recovery of CBF after stroke. This result supports that the IM measured in this study represent the cellular energy metabolism-related active motion of intracellular organelles rather than free diffusion of intracellular macromolecules.",Excluded

3196,"Evaluation of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other tremors: Survival of neurons adjacent to the thalamic lesion after gamma thalamotomy Object. The effects of gamma thalamotomy for parkinsonian and other kinds of tremor were evaluated. Methods. Thirty-six thalamotomies were performed in 31 patients by using a 4-mm collimator. The maximum dose was 150 Gy in the initial six cases, which was reduced to 130 Gy thereafter. The longest follow-up period was 6 years. The target was determined on T<inf>2</inf>-weighted and proton magnetic resonance (MR) images. The point chosen was in the lateral-most part of the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus. This is in keeping with open thalamotomy as practiced at the authors' institution. In 15 cases, gamma thalamotomy was the first surgical procedure. In other cases, previous therapeutic or vascular lesions were visible to facilitate targeting. Two types of tissue reaction were onserved on MR imaging: a simple oval shape and a complex irregular shape. Neither of these changes affected the clinical course. In the majority of cases, the tremor subsided after a latent interval of approximately 1 year after irradiation. The earliest response was demonstrated at 3 months. In five cases the tremor remained. In four of these cases, a second radiation session was administered. One of these four patients as well as another patient with an unsatisfactory result underwent open thalamotomy with microrecording. In both cases, depth recording adjacent to the necrotic area revealed normal neuronal activity, including the rhythmic discharge of tremor. Minor coagulation was performed and resulted in immediate and complete arrest of the remaining tremor. Conclusions. Gamma thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease seems to be an alternative useful method in selected cases.",Excluded
2407,"Neuroprotective effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity in mice through modulating mitochondrial dynamics Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of protein inclusions and the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Abnormal mitochondrial homeostasis is thought to be important for the pathogenesis of PD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, constitutes a promising approach for promoting recovery of various neurological conditions. However, little is known about its mechanism of action. The present study elucidated the neuroprotective effects of tDCS on the mitochondrial quality control pathway in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. We used the MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in vivo model. Mice were stimulated for 5 consecutive days with MPTP treatment. After observation of behavioral alteration using the rotarod test, mice were sacrificed for the measurement of the PD- and mitochondrial quality control-related protein levels in the substantia nigra. tDCS improved the behavioral alterations and changes in tyrosine hydroxylase levels in MPTP-treated mice. Furthermore, tDCS attenuated mitochondrial damage, as indicated by diminished mitochondrial swelling and mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase activity in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model. MPTP significantly increased mitophagy and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins. These changes were attenuated by tDCS. Furthermore, MPTP significantly increased fission-related protein dynamin-related protein 1 with no effect on fusion-related protein mitofusin-2, and tDCS attenuated these changes. Our findings demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of anodal tDCS on the MPTP-induced neurotoxic mouse model through suppressing excessive mitophagy and balancing mitochondrial dynamics. The neuroprotective effect of anodal tDCS with modulation of mitochondrial dynamics provides a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.",Excluded

A two-step procedure was designed to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulus and exogenous gene delivery for inducing neurogenesis. First, an electrical stimulation device was designed using gold nanoparticles adsorbed to the surface of a cover glass. Gold nanoparticles, as an electrical conductor for stem cells, are well-defined particles adsorbed to a polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated cover glass. The nanoparticle morphology was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Second, a plasmid carrying Nurr1 cDNA was complexed with biodegradable poly-(DL)-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles to support neurogenesis. To evaluate the neuronal differentiation of stem cells mediated by the treatment with either electrical stimulation and exogenous Nurr1 gene delivery, or both, the expression of neuron-specific genes and proteins was examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cells transfected with exogenous Nurr1 genes plus electrical stimulation (250 mV for 1000 s) showed the greatest level of neurite outgrowth with a mean neurite length of 150 mum. Neurite length in cells treated with only one stimulus was not significant, approximately 10-20 mum.

The safety and durability of carotid artery revascularization through a radiated field has been debated. We describe the immediate and long-term results in a series of 27 consecutive patients who received treatment over 12 years.METHODS: From May 1990 to May 2002, 27 consecutive patients underwent 30 primary carotid artery revascularization procedures. All patients had received previous radiation therapy within a mean interval of 10 years (range, 1-26 years), with average radiation dose of 62 Gy (range, 50-70 Gy). Moderate to severe scarring of the skin or radiation fibrosis was present in three fourths of patients. Thirteen patients (48%) had undergone radical neck dissection, and 2 patients had a permanent tracheotomy. The indications for carotid surgery included high-grade (>70%) symptomatic stenosis in 18 patients (60%) and high-grade asymptomatic stenosis in 12 patients (40%). General anesthesia with systematic shunting was used in 18 patients (60%), and regional anesthesia with selective shunting was used in 12 patients (40%). Operations included standard carotid endarterectomy (n = 20), with patch angioplasty (n = 12) or direct closure (n = 8); carotid interposition bypass grafting (n = 7); and subclavian to carotid bypass grafting (n = 3). Primary closure of the surgical wound was performed in all procedures without any special muscular or skin flaps. All patients were followed up for a mean of 40 months (range, 3-99 months).RESULTS: There was one (3.3%) perioperative death, from massive intracerebral hemorrhage; and 1 patient had a transient ischemic attack. In-hospital complications included neck hematoma in 2 patients, which required surgical drainage in 1 patient. There was neither delayed wound healing nor infection. Twelve patients died during follow-up, of causes not related to treatment. None of the surviving patients had further stroke, and all remained asymptomatic. Follow-up duplex scans showed asymptomatic recurrent stenosis greater than 60% in 3 patients, 2 of whom with stenosis greater than 80% underwent repeat operation. Risk for recurrent stenosis greater than 60% at 18 months was 16.6%. Recurrent stenosis occurred in 2 of these patients after saphenous vein bypass, and in 1 patient after endarterectomy with vein patch angioplasty.CONCLUSION: The clinical results and sustained freedom from symptoms and stroke over 40-month follow-up suggests that carotid revascularization through a radiated field is a safe and durable procedure in patients at high surgical risk, despite a marked incidence of recurrent stenosis.",Excluded

Of the 15 neurological disorders listed, some of which have symptoms of progeria, six - spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - seem to result from increased oxidative stress, and the inability of the base excision repair pathway to handle the damage to DNA that this induces. Five of the conditions (xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, Down syndrome, and triple-A syndrome) display a defect in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, four (Huntington's disease, various spinocerebellar ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia and myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2) exhibit an unusual expansion of repeat sequences in DNA, and four (ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Alzheimer's disease) exhibit defects in genes involved in repairing double-strand breaks.

This range is partly due to variability in outcome measurement and inclusion of differing patient characteristics and operative indications; it is unclear which factors are predisposing factors for complications and risk of reoperation in these studies leaving preoperative counseling difficult. We seek to characterize the impact that patient specific factors and operative indications have on risk of complications and reoperation for patients undergoing a right colon pouch as well as present the cumulative risk of reoperation over time. METHOD(S): Patients undergoing right colon pouch from January 2010 to April 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Outcomes of interest were rate of Clavien-Dindo complications in the perioperative period, readmission rate, and rate of reoperation. Patient specific factors association with Clavien Grade 3+ complications and reoperation were also analyzed. Operative indication for patients was stratified into: Cancer, Radiation Injury, Neurogenic, and Non-Neurogenic. A Kaplan Meier plot was used to characterize reoperation risk over time with death as a competing factor. RESULT(S): During the study period 60 patients underwent the procedure with an average follow up of 22 months. The rate of Clavien Grade 3+ complications and readmission rate in the 90 day post operative period was 25% and 43% respectively. The cumulative rate of reoperation was 52%. Overall no patient factors or operative indications were significantly associated with complications or reoperation. CONCLUSION(S): Overall the rate of complications, readmissions, and reoperation was high, but in agreement with other contemporary series. Right colon pouch is a difficult procedure on which to counsel patients due to the paucity of available data. The surgical outcomes and results at our center help further characterize the risks associated with this procedure, and the Kaplan Meier plot of reoperation risk can be used to illustrate that this procedure comes with significant risks over time.",Excluded
3395,"Dye-induced photolesion in the mammalian retina: glial and neuronal reactions Irradiation in the presence of a dye applied to the extracellular space is known to produce degenerative features in irradiated neurones and fibers. In the present study, we confirmed the potential use of this procedure as a lesion technique by showing the removal of degenerating elements as part of the glial reaction to the lesion. The dye Rose Bengal was applied to the vitreous body of a rat eye and a T-shaped irradiation pattern was projected onto the retina within the absorption band of the dye. Degenerative features were restricted to the irradiated area, which could be readily identified from its shape. Retinae examined after various survival times showed that macrophages invaded the damaged area within 1 day, and that mitotic activity of reactive glial cells subsequently occurred in the vicinity of the wound. Both cell types were identified by their structural features. Macrophages were also revealed by a staining technique using the dye Nile Red, whereas reactive glial cells were immunolabeled with an antibody directed against the glial fibrillary acidic protein. Reactive glial cells helped the macrophages to gradually remove injured cells and damaged processes. Their main task, however, appeared to be in scar formation, since their processes seemed to suture the lips of the wound together and restore the limiting membrane at the inner retina. After 2 months' survival time, the parent ganglion cells of most disrupted axon bundles had retrogradely degenerated, but regenerating ganglion cell axons were also observed. These results provide some new data about healing processes in the retina. They demonstrate that the dye-induced photolesion technique can be used to either remove or axotomize selected neurones in neural networks which have been made optically accessible.",Excluded

2743,"Fictive swimming motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish Larval zebrafish provide a unique model for investigating the mechanisms involved in generating rhythmic patterns of behavior, such as swimming, due to the array of techniques available including genetics, optical imaging, and conventional electrophysiology. Because electrophysiological and imaging studies of rhythmic motor behaviors in paralyzed preparations depend on the ability to monitor the central motor pattern, we developed a fictive preparation in which the activity of axial motor neurons was monitored using extracellular recordings from peripheral nerves. We examined spontaneous and light induced fictive motor patterns in wild type and mutant larval zebrafish (4-6 days post-fertilization) paralyzed with curare. All spontaneous and light-induced preparations produced alternation of motor activity from side-to-side (mean contralateral phase = 50.7 +/- 7.0%; mean burst frequency = 35.6 +/- 4.7 Hz) and a progression of activity from head-to-tail (mean ipsilateral rostrocaudal delay = 0.8 +/- 0.5 ms per segment), consistent with lateral undulation and forward propulsion during swimming, respectively. The basic properties of the motor pattern were similar in spontaneous and light-induced swimming. This fictive preparation can be used in combination with conventional electrophysiological and imaging methods to investigate normal circuit function as well as to elucidate functional deficits in mutant lines. Toward this end, we show that two accordion class mutants, accordion and bandoneon, have alternating activity on opposite sides of the body, contradicting the hypothesis that their deficit results from the absence of the reciprocal glycinergic inhibition that is typically found in the spinal cord of swimming vertebrates.",Excluded

MRI of the spine showed nodular enhancement at the level of the cauda equina. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. Biopsy of the right CN V mass showed this to be glioblastoma. Conclusion(s): Leptomeningeal dissemination of glioblastoma is rare, occurring in about 4% of cases. In most of these cases, a parenchymal component is present that eventually disseminates along the ependymal lining of the brain to involve the leptomeninges. We here describe a unique presentation of a GB most likely arising from a CN followed by widespread leptomeningeal dissemination. The root entry zone (either the glial segment or the transition segment) of the cranial nerve is thought to be the anatomical point of origin for gliomas arising from CNs. Unfortunately despite being treated with radiation and chemotherapy, the patient passed away 3 months after presentation denoting the very poor prognosis associated with leptomeningeal spread of GB.",Excluded
3135,"[The effect of streptokinase on the development of rat cerebral cortex cells in vitro] The aim of this study was to determine the effect of streptokinase (SK) on the ultrastructure of cellular elements in the cerebral cortex of newborn rats in vitro. Three series of cell cultures grown on DMEM were used, including those grown on the medium enriched with 15% fetal calf serum (control 1), cultures transferred to the depleted medium containing only 0.5% of this serum (control 2), and the experimental cultures, to which SK (2000 IU/ml) was added. Addition of SK to the medium prevented a reduction of the viability of mature (14 days) dissociated neocortical cell culture from 1-2-day-old rats, induced by a transfer of the culture to a blood serum protein-deficient medium. In a 7-day culture SK potentiated the decrease in the cell viability. In organotypical cultures, with the use of electron microscopy, it was found that SK in concentration used prevented the development of destructive changes in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons of explants, induced by a deficit in serum proteins. The neurons contained numerous mitochondria, some of which had only a few cristae. Signs of destruction were observed only in neuronal nuclei. After exposure to SK for 48 hours an activation of oligodendrocytes (containing numerous myelin bodies) was noted which was accompanied by astrocyte disintegration (with hyperchromatic nuclei in the remaining cells). The neurons were resistant to SK exposure.",Excluded
2463,"Glutamate microinjection into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus attenuates ulcerative colitis in rats AIM: To investigate the effects of glutamate microinjection into hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats and to explore the relevant mechanisms.METHODS: 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (100 mg/kg in 50% ethanol) was instilled into the colon of adult male SD rats to induce UC. A colonic damage score (CDS) was used to indicate the severity of the colonic mucosal damage. The pathological changes in the colonic mucosa were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, biochemical analyses or ELISA. Ten minutes before UC induction, drugs were microinjected into the relevant nuclei in rat brain to produce chemical stimulation or chemical lesion.RESULTS: Microinjection of glutamate (3, 6 and 12 mug) into the PVN dose-dependently decreased the CDS in UC rats. This protective effect was eliminated after kainic acid (0.3 mug) was microinjected into PVN or into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) that caused chemical lesion of these nuclei. This protective effect was also prevented when the AVP-V1 receptor antagonist DPVDAV (200 ng) was microinjected into the NTS. The discharge frequency of the vagus was markedly decreased following microinjection of glutamate into the PVN. Microinjection of glutamate into the PVN in UC rats significantly increased the cell proliferation and anti-oxidant levels, and decreased the apoptosis and Bax and caspase 3 expression levels and reduced the pro-inflammatory factors in the colonic mucosa.CONCLUSION: The activation of hypothalamic PVN exerts protective effects against UC, which is mediated by the NTS and vagus. The effects may be achieved via anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory factors.",Excluded
2532,"Delayed occurrence of ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) 5 years after the diagnosis of a neuroendocrine carcinoma Background: Ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) in patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is characterized by increased mortality, however early detection and treatment of EAS may improve survival. In rare cases, EAS can arise >3 months after NEC diagnosis (metachronously). Elevations in plasma levels of the ACTH precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and/or agouti-related peptide (AgRP) have been associated with EAS. Clinical Case: A 61-year-old woman with a 5-year history of a poorly-differentiated lung neuroendocrine carcinoma with widely-disseminated metastases, treated with chemotherapy and radiation, was admitted for new-onset hypokalemia, 2 weeks after the initiation of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for lower extremity edema. Despite discontinuation of HCTZ, hypokalemia persisted and 120-200 meq of potassium chloride daily were required to maintain normal potassium levels. Proximal muscle weakness and hyperglycemia were noted. Morning cortisol and ACTH levels were 48 mcg/dL (nl 4.8-19.5mcg/dL) and 141pg/mL (nl 6-58 pg/mL) respectively, compared to a morning cortisol and ACTH of 9.3mcg/dL and 19pg/mL 5 years prior, at the time of NEC diagnosis. Serum cortisol was 61mcg/dL after an overnight 1mg dexamethasone suppression test and urinary free cortisol was 7544mcg/24h (nl<45mcg/24h), confirming the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. Plasma POMC and AgRP were measured and were 80 fmol/mL (nl <45 fmol/mL) and 884 pg/mL (nl<280 pg/mL), respectively, supporting a diagnosis of EAS. Potassium levels normalized following spironolactone treatment. Metyrapone therapy was initiated, but hypercortisolism persisted and the patient succumbed to multifocal pneumonia 4 weeks after presentation. Postmortem examination showed an absence of ACTH immunoreactivity in metastatic tumor tissue obtained at the time of diagnosis of NEC, as well as in the tissues biopsied 3 years later (subcarinal lymph node, liver). However, sites of tumor metastases (subcutaneous shoulder mass, ovary) sampled 4 or more years after NEC diagnosis showed focal staining for ACTH, consistent with EAS arising years after the development of NEC. Conclusion(s): This case highlights the rare occurrence of ectopic metachronous ACTH secretion occurring in a NEC. The observed elevations in plasma POMC likely reflect aberrant tumoral processing of POMC to ACTH. While glucocorticoids may modulate the synthesis and release of AgRP, the magnitude of the elevation in plasma AgRP in this case supports the possibility of a concomitant tumoral AgRP source. The elevations in plasma POMC and AgRP in EAS associated with NEC in this case underscore the potential utility of these neuropeptides as tumor markers that could improve clinical monitoring for EAS and facilitate more timely interventions to optimize survival.",Excluded

The intention was to measure patient skin dose and thus estimate the likelihood of deterministic effects occurring from such examinations. For each patient, several thermoluminescence (TL) dosemeters were placed on the areas of skin the radiologist or cardiologist considered were most likely to receive the greatest irradiation. Results are presented which indicate that several types of procedure have the potential to produce deterministic effects to patients' skin. It was concluded that skin dose should be routinely measured for each patient undergoing an interventional radiology procedure which has potentially a long fluoroscopy time.",Excluded
3491,"The impact of near-infrared light on dopaminergic cell survival in a transgenic mouse model of parkinsonism We have examined whether near-infrared light (NIr) treatment mitigates oxidative stress and increased expression of hyperphosphorylated tau in a tau transgenic mouse strain (K3) that has a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The brains of wild-type (WT), untreated K3 and NIr-treated K3 mice, aged five months (thus after the onset of parkinsonian signs and neuropathology), were labelled immunohistochemically for the oxidative stress markers 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), hyperphosphorylated tau (using the AT8 antibody) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The average intensity and area of 4-HNE, 8-OHDG and AT8 immunoreactivity were measured using the MetaMorph software and TH+ cell number was estimated using stereology. Our results showed immunoreactivity for 4-HNE, 8-OHDG and AT8 within the SNc was increased in K3 mice compared to WT, and that this increase was mitigated by NIr. Results further showed that TH+ cell number was lower in K3 mice than in WT, and that this loss was mitigated by NIr. In summary, NIr treatment reduced the oxidative stress caused by the tau transgene in the SNc of K3 mice and saved SNc cells from degeneration. Our results, when taken together with those in other models, strengthen the notion that NIr treatment saves dopaminergic cells in the parkinsonian condition.",Excluded
3590,"XAV939-mediated ARTD activity inhibition in human MB cell lines Diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferases 1 and 5 (ARTD-1, ARTD-5) are poly ADP-ribose enzymes (PARP) involved in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which is the major pathway of double-strand break (DSB) repair. In addition, ARTD-5, or Tankyrase (TNKS), is a positive regulator of the WNT signaling implicated in the development and biological behavior of many neoplasms, such as Medulloblastoma (MB), in which radiotherapy is an essential part of the treatment. The use of radiosensitizing agents may improve the therapeutic index in MB patients by increasing the efficacy of radiotherapy, while reducing toxicity to the neuroaxis. ARTD-5 seems to be a good molecular target for improving the current treatment of MB. In this study, we used the small molecule XAV939, a potent ARTD-5 inhibitor with a slight affinity for ARTD-1, in different human MB cell lines. XAV939 inhibited the WNT pathway and DNA-PKcs in our MB cells, with many biological consequences. The co-administration of XAV939 and ionizing radiations (IR) inhibited MB cells proliferation and clonogenic capacity, decreased their efficacy in repairing DNA damage, and increased IR-induced cell mortality. In conclusion, our in vitro data show that XAV939 could be a very promising small molecule in MB treatment, and these results lay the basis for further in vivo studies with the aim of improving the current therapy available for MB patients.",Excluded
3429,"[Rules of application and mode of action of transcranial direct current stimulation in neurorehabilitation: primary motor cortex] Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging technique of non-invasive brain stimulation that has been found useful in facilitating treatment of various neurological disorders, especially stroke. Currently available criteria for single application of several minutes-long stimulation at 1-2 mA have been considered safe. However, knowledge regarding safety parameters of repeated and long-term electrical stimulation is so far limited. Studies on the use of tDCS focus predominantly on the motor cortex. They demonstrate that weak direct current is capable of eliciting cortical excitability changes which occur during and after stimulation. The nature of these changes is specific for current polarity - anodal stimulation enhances excitability, and cathodal reduces it. Studies indicate that tDCS effects are generated by polarity-driven alterations of membrane potentials and efficacy modulations of specific neuronal receptors. According to interhemispheric competition models, possible mechanisms underlying functional improvements due to stimulation in patients with stroke are attributed to tDCS-induced modification of inappropriate interhemispheric inhibition.

3063,"Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors enable two distinct forms of long-term depression in the rat dentate gyrus in vivo The existence of long-term depression (LTD) in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats, as well as the contribution of different types of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) to this form of plasticity, has been the subject of much debate. Here, we describe two distinct forms of mGluR-dependent hippocampal LTD in the dentate gyrus of freely moving adult rats. LTD, induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of the medial perforant path (LFS-LTD), was prevented by antagonism of the phospholipase C-coupled receptors, mGluR1 but not mGluR5. Chemical LTD, induced by intracerebral application of the group I mGluR agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, was blocked by antagonism of both mGluR5 and mGluR1. Selective activation of mGluR5, using (R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG), also led to chemical LTD. To test whether LFS-LTD and chemical LTD share common induction mechanisms, we applied LFS following the induction of chemical LTD by CHPG (CHPG-LTD). Surprisingly, LFS impaired CHPG-LTD. Further analysis revealed that induction of CHPG-LTD led to altered calcium dynamics sufficient for its reversal by LFS. We found that LTD induced by (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, but not by CHPG, is impaired by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism. Both forms of chemical LTD strongly require calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. This contrasts with previous findings that LFS-LTD in the dentate gyrus is both N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and voltage-gated calcium channel independent. LFS-LTD and LTD induced by group I mGluR agonists thus appear to comprise distinct forms of LTD that require the activation of specific group I mGluRs and recruit calcium from different sources.",Excluded
3397,"Treatment of near-skull brain tissue with a focused device using shear-mode conversion: a numerical study Shear mode transmission through the skull has been previously proposed as a new trans-skull propagation technique for noninvasive therapeutic ultrasound (Clement 2004 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115 1356-64). The main advantage of choosing shear over longitudinal mode resides on the fact that there is less wavefront distortion with the former. In the present study, the regions of the brain suitable for shear-mode transmission were established for a simple focused ultrasound device. The device consists of a spherically curved transducer that has a focal length of 10 cm, an aperture between 30 degrees and 60 degrees and operates at 0.74 MHz. The regions suitable for shear-mode transmission were determined by the shear wave acoustic windows that matched the shape of the device acoustic field. The acoustic windows were calculated using segmentation and triangulation of outer and inner faces of skull from 3D-MRI head datasets. Nine heads of healthy adults were analyzed. The surface considered for the calculations was the head region found above the supra-orbital margin. For every inspected point in the brain volume, the axis of the device was determined by the vector between this inspection point and a point located in the center of the brain. Numerical predictions of the acoustic field, where shear-mode conversion through the skull was considered, were obtained and compared to the case of water-only conditions. The brain tissue that is close to the skull showed suitable acoustic windows for shear waves. The central region of the brain seems to be unreachable using shear-mode. Analysis of the acoustic fields showed a proportional relation between the acoustic window for shear mode and the effective degree of focusing. However, this relation showed significant differences among specimens. In general, highly focused fields were obtained when the acoustic window for shear waves (A(SW)) intersected more than 67% of the entering acoustic window (A(TX)) of the device. The average depth from the inner surface of the skull showing this intersection value was 13 +/- 10 mm (mean +/- SD). The differences of the degree of focusing observed among patients suggest that the intersection A(SW) intersection A(TX) can be used as a preliminary criterion for screening and calculation of the acoustic fields should confirm the degree of focusing patient by patient. In conclusion, shear waves provide a useful method for trans-cranial focusing in regions close to the skull surface.",Excluded

2563,"Asynchronous inputs and NMDA conductances predict excitatory responses in the cortical-cA1 pathway of the hippocampus In the hippocampus, CA1 place cells are driven by a substantial input from CA3. There is a second pathway to CA1 from the entorhinal cortex. The mode of action of cortex on CA1 through this pathway is not known. The pathway supports CA1 place field activity after CA3 has been lesioned, yet stimulation of the pathway in rat slices results in strong feedforward inhibition that prevents pyramidal cell action potentials. We use a detailed conductance-based model of this pathway to simulate the response to cortical stimulation in slice experiments and in vivo spatial exploration. We find that the presence of NMDA conductances enable CA1 pyramidal cells to integrate cortical inputs over a time scale longer than that which is effective in recruiting the inhibitory response that can suppress action potentials. We then show that this asynchronous response mode supports place field formation in response to experimentally constrained spatially modulated cortical activity. Within this model, the inclusion of GABAB conductances and the hyperpolarisation activated current I(h) reduces the strength of the GABAA inputs required to balance the excitatory inputs, and this facilitates place field formation by reducing variability in the inhibitory inputs.",Excluded
3340,"Emerging locoregional therapy Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT): SIRT, or radioembolization, delivers yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres via a catheter in the hepatic artery to treat intra-hepatic disease. SIRT takes advantage of the fact that the blood supply for much of the normal liver parenchyma arrives through the portal circulation, while tumors are preferentially fed by the arterial system. Glass- or resin-based microspheres tagged with Y-90 are delivered typically in a ""lobar"" fashion and preferentially distribute into the tumoral and peritumoral vasculature, thereby delivering a high radiation dose (>100 Gy). Because Y-90 is a beta emitter, the effect is relatively selective and mostly affects only the metastatic sites while sparing normal liver parenchyma. The two currently available Y-90 products include SIR-spheres and TheraSphere. SIR-spheres deliver a higher dose per treatment and are more embolic. In contrast, the TheraSphere product delivers a higher specific radioactivity dose per microsphere allowing for smaller dose per treatment and are not as embolic. Both products have been shown to be welltolerated. SIRT can be an effective therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as metastatic colorectal or neuroendocrine liver disease.",Excluded
3254,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals abnormal plastic response to premotor cortex stimulation in schizophrenia BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia may be characterized by abnormal plastic modulation in cortical neuronal circuits. Activation of premotor cortex using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) produces suppression of cortical excitability in primary motor cortex. We hypothesized that premotor rTMS would cause less suppression of motor cortical excitability in patients with schizophrenia than in control subjects.METHODS: Twelve patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and twelve healthy control subjects underwent subthreshold rTMS to the premotor area in a 15-min conditioning train. Measurements of primary motor cortical excitability (motor evoked potential; MEP), the resting motor threshold (RMT), and cortical inhibition (CI) were taken before and after the rTMS.RESULTS: There was no difference in RMT between groups at baseline, although the patient group had less CI than the control group at baseline. Following rTMS, the change in both MEP size and RMT between groups was significant. After rTMS, MEP size was suppressed in the control group and increased in the patient group, whereas RMT increased in the normal control group and decreased in the patient group.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate abnormal brain responses to rTMS applied to the premotor cortex that appear to relate to reduced motor cortical inhibition.",Excluded

Crew placement accuracy rate, operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage, postoperative hospitalization time, radiation exposure time, postoperative improvement in R value, Cobb's angle and visual analog scale (VAS) scores of the two methods were compared. There were no significant differences in the accuracy rate of pedicle screw placement, radiation exposure and postoperative R value and Cobb's angle improvement between the two groups. However, the mini-open method had obvious advantages over the conventional open method in operative time, blood loss, postoperative drainage, postoperative hospitalization time, and postoperative improvement in VAS. The mini-open pedicle screw technique could be applied in treatment of single-segment thoracolumbar fracture without neurologic injury and had advantages of less tissue trauma, short operative and rehabilitative time on the premise of guaranteed accuracy rate and no increased radiation exposure.",Excluded
2542,"Comparison of four scatter correction methods using Monte Carlo simulated source distributions UNLABELLED: Scatter correction in SPECT is important for improving image quality, boundary detection and the quantification of activity in different regions. This paper presents a comparison of four scatter correction methods, three using more than one energy window and one convolution-subtraction correction method using spatial variant scatter line-spread functions.METHODS: The comparison is based on Monte Carlo simulated data for point sources on- and off-axis, hot and cold spheres of different diameters, and a clinically realistic source distribution simulating brain imaging. All studies were made for a uniform cylindrical water phantom. Since the nature of the detected photon is known with Monte Carlo simulation, separate images of primary and scattered photons can be recorded. These can then be compared with estimated scatter and primary images obtained from the different scatter correction methods. The criteria for comparison were the normalized mean square error, scatter fraction, % recovery and image contrast.RESULTS: All correction methods significantly improved image quality and quantification compared to those obtained with no correction. Quantitatively, no single method was observed to be the best by all criteria for all the source distributions. Three of the methods were observed to perform the best by at least one of the criteria for one of the source distributions. For brain imaging, the differences between all the methods were much less than the difference between them and no correction at all.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that performing scatter correction is essential for accurate quantification, and that all four methods yield a good, but not perfect, scatter correction. Since it is hard to distinguish the methods consistently in terms of their performance, it may be that the choice should be made on the basis of ease of implementation.",Excluded
3508,"Interaction between age of irradiation and age of testing in the disruption of operant performance using a ground-based model for exposure to cosmic rays Previous research has shown a progressive deterioration in cognitive performance in rats exposed to (56)Fe particles as a function of age. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of age of irradiation independently of the age of testing. Male Fischer-344 rats, 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age, were exposed to 25-200 cGy of (56)Fe particles (1,000 MeV/n). Following irradiation, the rats were trained to make an operant response on an ascending fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule. When performance was evaluated as a function of both age of irradiation and testing, the results showed a significant effect of age on the dose needed to produce a performance decrement, such that older rats exposed to lower doses of (56)Fe particles showed a performance decrement compared to younger rats. When performance was evaluated as a function of age of irradiation with the age of testing held constant, the results indicated that age of irradiation was a significant factor influencing operant responding, such that older rats tested at similar ages and exposed to similar doses of (56)Fe particles showed similar performance decrements. The results are interpreted as indicating that the performance decrement is not a function of age per se, but instead is dependent upon an interaction between the age of irradiation, the age of testing, and exposure to HZE particles. The nature of these effects and how age of irradiation affects cognitive performance after an interval of 15 to 16 months remains to be established.",Included

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was completed twice, with a 1-yr interval. This questionnaire was also completed by an age- and sex-matched normative population (N = 580). Detailed data on treatment were extracted from the cancer registry and Population-based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies (PHAROS).RESULTS: Of the 181 patients who were invited, 148 responded (82%, T1). Patients treated with immunochemotherapy reported clinically relevant higher mean fatigue scores than those who underwent radiotherapy (P = 0.02). No differences were observed on the other HRQoL scales between treatment groups. Mean HRQoL scores were worse for FL patients treated with immunochemotherapy compared with a normative population (P < 0.01). A quarter to 50% of patients persistently reported to be slowed down, lethargic, or persistently worried about future health or was limited in social activities. Subsequently, patients reporting these symptoms/worries had a lower global health status/HRQoL.CONCLUSION: Alertness for persistent symptoms that occur during and after treatment of FL patients is needed and may help to avoid lasting negative influence on their HRQoL.",Excluded

Additional advantages include the relative ease of thermal neutron generation and the ability to shield the patient completely and effectively from fast neutrons or gamma rays originating at the neutron source.

Phase I/II clinical trials on brain metastasis are underway using venous infusion of iodinated contrast agents. The radiation dose enhancement depends on the amount of iodine in the tumor and its time course. Quantitative, post-infusion iodine bio-distribution and associated brain perfusion parameters were studied in human brain metastasis as key parameters for treatment feasibility and quality. The reproducibility of iodine concentrations between the recruitment day and the treatment day was assessed in order to predict dose errors. Materials/Methods: Twelve patients received an intravenous bolus of iodinated contrast agent (40 mL, 4 mL/s), followed by a steady-state infusion (160 mL, 0.5 mL/s) in order to ensure stable intratumoral amounts of iodine during the treatment. Absolute iodine concentrations and quantitative perfusion maps were derived from 40 multi-slice dynamic conventional CT images of the brain (recruitment day) or from quantitative synchrotron radiation CT (treatment day). For three of these patients, iodine concentrations reached in the tumor were compared between the recruitment day and the treatment day (~ 10 days interval). Result(s): The post-infusion mean intratumoral iodine concentration (over thirty minutes) reached 1.94 +/- 0.12 mg/mL. Reasonable correlations were obtained between these concentrations and the permeability surface area product and the cerebral blood volume. Iodine concentrations were reproducible leading to dose errors in the radiotherapy standards. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study of contrast agent biodistribution versus time in brain metastasis. The study demonstrates that suitable and stable amounts of iodine can be reached in brain metastasis for SSRT treatment. Moreover, the associated perfusion measurements provide useful information for the patient recruitment and management processes.",Excluded

Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party In patients with non-metastatic but inoperable non-small cell lung cancer that is locally too extensive for radical radiotherapy (RT), but who have good performance status, it is important to determine whether thoracic RT should be the minimum that is required to palliate thoracic symptoms or whether treatment should be more intensive, with the aim of prolonging survival. A total of 509 such patients from 11 centres in the UK between November 1989 and October 1992 were admitted to a trial comparing palliative versus more intensive RT with respect to survival and quality of life. They were allocated at random to receive thoracic RT with either 17 Gy in two fractions (F2) 1 week apart (255 patients) or 39 Gy in 13 fractions (F13) 5 days per week (254 patients). Survival was better in the F13 group, the median survival periods being 7 months in the F2 group compared with 9 months in the F13 group, and the survival rates 31% and 36% at one year and 9% and 12% at 2 years, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.82; 95% CI0.69-0.99). There was a suggestion of a trend towards greater benefit in fitter patients. Metastases appeared earlier in the F2 group. As recorded by patients using the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the commonest symptoms on admission were cough, shortness of breath, tiredness, lack of energy, worrying and chest pain. These were more rapidly palliated by the F2 regimen. Psychological distress was generally lower in the F13 group. Three patients (two F13, one F2) exhibited evidence of myelopathy. As recorded by patients using a diary card, 76% of the F2 compared with 81% of the F13 patients had dysphagia associated with their RT. This was transient, lasting for a median of 6.5 days in the F2 group compared with 14 days in the F13 group. In conclusion, the F2 regimen had a more rapid palliative effect. In the F13 group, although treatment-related dysphagia was worse, survival was longer.",Excluded

In this study we investigated whether exposure to ELF-MF (50 Hz-1 mT) harms cerebral DNA and induces expression of 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp70).MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD1 mice were exposed to a MF (50 Hz-1 mT) for 1 or 7 days (15 h/day) and sacrificed either at the end of exposure or after 24 h. Unexposed and sham-exposed mice were used as controls. Mouse brains were dissected into cerebral cortex-striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum to evaluate primary DNA damage and hsp70 gene expression. Food intake, weight gain, and motor activity were also evaluated.RESULTS: An increase in primary DNA damage was detected in all cerebral areas of the exposed mice sacrificed at the end of exposure, as compared to controls. DNA damage, as can be evaluated by the comet assay, appeared to be repaired in mice sacrificed 24 h after a 7-day exposure. Neither a short (15 h) nor long (7 days) MF-exposure induced hsp70 expression, metabolic and behavioural changes.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in vivo ELF-MF induce reversible brain DNA damage while they do not elicit the stress response.",Excluded

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF LONG-TERM BOWEL DAMAGE AFTER PELVIC RADIOTHERAPY: Long-term damage to the bowel after radiotherapy is mediated by ischaemic changes and fibrosis. Each fraction of radiotherapy causes a series of repetitive injuries to the intestinal tissue resulting in an altered healing process, which affects the integrity of the repair and changes the architecture of the bowel wall. THE NATURE OF GI SYMPTOMS THAT DEVELOP: Patient-reported outcome measures show that diarrhoea, urgency, increased bowel frequency, tenesmus and flatulence are the five most prevalent GI symptoms with a moderate or severe impact on patients' daily lives after treatment with pelvic radiotherapy. Many patients also experience fatigue, urinary problems and have sexual concerns. SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT: The complex nature of those symptoms warrants systematic assessment and management. The use of a tested algorithm can assist in achieving this. The most common contributing factors to ongoing bowel problems after pelvic radiotherapy are small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bile acid malabsorption, pancreatic insufficiency, rectal bleeding and its impact on bone health.THE WIDER CONTEXT: Symptom burden, socio-psychosocial impact, memory and cognitive function, fatigue, urinary problems and sexual concerns need to be taken into account when thinking about consequences of cancer treatment.CONCLUSION: As our understanding of consequences of cancer treatments continues to emerge and encompass a wide variety of specialties, a holistic, multifaceted and multidisciplinary approach is required to manage those consequences long-term.",Excluded
2604,"Furosemide potentiates the anticonvulsant action of valproate in the mouse maximal electroshock seizure model Accumulating evidence indicates that furosemide (FUR, a loop diuretic) exerts the anticonvulsant action in various in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of FUR on the protective action of numerous conventional and newer antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine [CBZ], lamotrigine [LTG], oxcarbazepine [OXC], phenobarbital [PB], topiramate [TPM] and valproate [VPA]) in the mouse maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model. Results indicate that FUR (up to 100mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the test) neither altered the threshold for electroconvulsions nor protected the animals against MES-induced seizures in mice. FUR (100 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the anticonvulsant effects of VPA in the MES test by reducing its ED(50) value from 230.4 to 185.4 mg/kg (P<0.05). In contrast, FUR at 100 mg/kg had no significant effect on the antielectroshock action of the remaining drugs tested (CBZ, LTG, OXC, PB, and TPM) in mice. Estimation of free plasma and total brain VPA concentrations revealed that the observed interaction between FUR and VPA in the MES test was pharmacodynamic in nature because neither free plasma nor total brain VPA concentrations were altered after i.p. administration of FUR. In conclusion, one can ascertain that the selective potentiation of the antielectroshock action of VPA by FUR and lack of any pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs, make this combination of pivotal importance for epileptic patients treated with VPA and received FUR from other than epilepsy reasons.",Excluded
3105,"Effect of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide-38 on sensory neuropeptide release and neurogenic inflammation in rats and mice Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), released from capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves induce local neurogenic inflammation, while somatostatin exerts systemic anti-inflammatory actions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the release of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38) and its effects on sensory neuropeptide release in vitro and acute neurogenic ear swelling in vivo. Capsaicin (10(-6) M) or electrical field stimulation (EFS; 40 V, 0.1 ms, 10 Hz, 120 s; 1200 impulses)-induced release of PACAP-38, SP, CGRP and somatostatin from isolated rat tracheae was measured with radioimmunoassay. Mustard oil-induced neurogenic inflammation in the mouse ear was determined with a micrometer and in the rat hind paw skin by the Evans Blue leakage technique. Capsaicin and EFS evoked 27% and more than twofold elevation of PACAP-38 release respectively, compared with the prestimulated basal values from isolated trachea preparation. Exogenously administered PACAP-38 (20-2000 nM) diminished both capsaicin- and EFS-evoked sensory neuropeptide release in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal inhibitory effects of PACAP on capsaicin-induced substance P, CGRP and somatostatin release amounted to 75.4%, 73.3% and 90.0%, while EFS-evoked release of these peptides was 80.03%, 87.7% and 67.7%. In case of capsaicin stimulation the EC50 values for substance P, CGRP and somatostatin were 82.9 nM, 60.1 nM and 66.9 nM, respectively. When EFS was performed, these corresponding EC50 data were 92.1 nM, 67.8 nM and 20.9 nM. PACAP-38 (10, 100 and 1000 microg/kg i.p. in 200 microl volume) inhibited neurogenic ear swelling in the mouse. Furthermore, 100 microg/kg i.p. PACAP also significantly diminished mustard oil-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the rat skin. These results suggest that PACAP-38 is released from the stimulated peripheral terminals of capsaicin-sensitive afferents and it is able to inhibit the outflow of sensory neuropeptides. Based on this mechanism of action PACAP is also able to effectively diminish/abolish neurogenic inflammatory response in vivo after systemic administration.",Excluded
3152,"Radiosurgery for re-irradiation of brain metastasis: Results in 54 patients Purpose: To evaluate in terms of probabilities of local-regional control and survival, as well as of treatment-related toxicity, results of radiosurgery for brain metastasis arising in previously irradiated territory. Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and March 2000, 54 consecutive patients presenting with 97 metastases relapsing after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Median interval between the end of WBRT and radiosurgery was 9 months (range 2-70). Median age was 53 years (24-80), and median Karnofski performance status (KPS) 70 (60-100). Forty-seven patients had one radiosurgery, five had two and two had three. Median metastasis diameter and volume were 21 mm (6-59) and 1.2 cc (0.1-95.2), respectively. A Leksell stereotactic head frame (Leksell Model G, Elektra, Instrument, Tucker, GA) was applied under local anesthesia. Irradiation was delivered by a gantry mounted linear accelerator (linacs) (Saturne, General Electric). Median minimal dose delivered to the gross disease was 16.2 Gy (11.8-23), and median maximal dose 21.2 Gy (14- 42). Result(s): Median follow-up was 9 months (1-57). Five metastases recurred. One- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 91.3 and 84% and 1- and 2-year brain control rates were 65 and 57%, respectively. Six patients died of brain metastasis evolution, and three of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 31 and 28%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, KPS, RPA class, SIR score and interval between WBRT and radiosurgery were prognostic factors of overall survival and brain free-disease survival. According to multivariate analysis, RPA was an independent factor of overall survival and brain free-disease survival, and the interval between WBRT and radiosurgery longer than 14 months was associated with longer brain free-disease survival. Side effects were minimal, with only two cases of headaches and two of grade 2 alopecia. Conclusion(s): Salvage radiosurgery of metastasis recurring after whole brain irradiation is an effective and accurate treatment which could be proposed to patients with a KPS > 70 and a primary tumour controlled or indolent. We recommend that a dose not exceeding 14 Gy should be delivered to an isodose representing 70% of the maximal dose since local control observed rate was similar to that previously published in literature with upper dose and side effects were minimal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Excluded

To further define the population evaluated, certain criteria were used: (a) a minimum of 3000 cGy to at least 2 cm of cervical spinal cord and (b) a minimum of 1 year of follow-up, unless a neurological complication occurred before 1 year. A total of 1112 patients were evaluable, of which 2 (0.18%) developed radiation myelitis. One received 4658 cGy to the cervical cord at 172.5 cGy per day, and the other patient received 4907 cGy to the cord at 169.2 cGy per day. The risk of myelitis at each dose level was 0/124 at 3000-3999 cGy, 0/442 at 4000-4499 cGy, 2/471 at 4500-4999 cGy, and 0/75 at a cord dose of 5000 cGy or greater.",Excluded
2766,"Serotonergic modulation of psychological stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampal CA1 field In order to elucidate possible involvement of the serotonergic neuronal system in the stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity, the effects of contextual fear conditioning (CFC) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 field were examined in 5-HT-depleted rats by pretreatment with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, 200 microg/rat, i.c.v.). LTP induction was suppressed by footshock (FS) stimulation in 5-HT-lesioned rats and vehicle-treated controls. When rats were exposed to CFC, which was received 24 h after FS stimulation, LTP was also blocked in both-treated groups. CFC-induced impairment of LTP, however, significantly attenuated in 5-HT-lesioned rats when compared with that in controls. Fear-related freezing behavior after FS stimulation occurred similarly in both treated groups, whereas the behavior observed during exposure to CFC significantly reduced in 5-HT-lesioned rats. These results suggest that the serotonergic mechanism is involved in the psychological stress-induced alteration in synaptic plasticity, which appears to be associated with fear-related behavior.",Excluded
2648,"Assessment of blood pressure control and target organ damage in a treated hypertensive population-Is clinic BP measurement enough? Introduction/Background & Aims: Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease and a major contributor to morbidity, mortality, and disability worldwide. Hypertension is also a major CV risk factor in Saudi Arabia, with a prevalence of some 26% in the general population but higher in established CV disease, ranging between 45% and 75%. Despite a large repertoire of antihypertensive drugs available, blood pressure (BP) control rates are still suboptimal. Recent studies have shown that clinic BP alone may be a poor guide to hypertension control. Ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) is the gold standard for diagnosis of hypertension, assessment of BP control, and its various patterns may provide prognostic information beyond clinic BP. Therefore, the primary aim of our study was to compare BP control with clinic versus ABPM criteria. The secondary aim was to study the relationship between various ABPM patterns and subclinical target organ damage, ie, urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), and arterial stiffness as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and biomarkers including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in a Saudi hypertensive population. Method/Summary of work: We studied consecutive patients aged 18-80 years old referred to the Hypertension Clinic at King Abdul Aziz Cardiac Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between January 2016 and December 2018. ABPM was performed for a 24-hour period with an oscillometric device (Spacelabs), with readings every 30 minutes from 6 AM to 10 PM, and every 60 minutes from 10 PM to 6 AM. Patient diary was used to define sleep/wake periods. White coat effect was defined as office systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=90 mmHg with daytime ABPM SBP <135 mmHg and DBP <85 mmHg. Uncontrolled clinic BP was defined as systolic >140 mmHg and diastolic BP >90 mmHg. Masked uncontrolled hypertension (MUCH) was defined as controlled clinic BP with daytime BP >=135/85 mmHg (definition-1); 24-hour ambulatory BP >= 130/80 mmHg (definition- 2); and either daytime BP >= 135/85 mmHg or nighttime BP >=120/70 mmHg (definition-3). Dipping was defined as a 10-20% fall in nocturnal BP; non-dipping as <10%, reverse-dipping as <=0%, and extreme dipping as >20%. Arterial stiffness was measured as PWV using SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical, Australia) and Mobilograph (IEM Medical). Hs-CRP, BNP, and ACR were measured using standard laboratory investigations. Results analysed using JMP Version 13, p < 0.05 considered significant. The study had Institutional Ethics Committee permission. Results/Discussion: The study population included 428 subjects (mean age 53.5 +/- 14 years, female = 45%). Nine percent of the population had WC; 45% had uncontrolled hypertension using clinic BP compared with ABPM criteria; 24 hr, 68%; daytime, 56%; and nighttime, 86% (p < 0.0001). Overall, 71% of the patients had MUCH which was driven by nocturnal hypertension vs. 24 hr or daytime (70% vs. 42% vs. 32%, p < 0.0001) respectively. Seventy-nine percent of the cohort had non-dipping of which 45% were reverse dippers; 6% extreme dippers and 18% dippers. Patients with ambulatory hypertension had significantly higher ACR (30.8 +/- 8 vs. 6.2 +/- 6, p < 0.01), PWV (11.2 vs. 8.9, p < 0.001), BNP (1.2 +/- 1 vs. 6.5 +/- 1, p < 0.05), and hs- CRP (1.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.4 +/- 2.3, p < 0.01) compared with those with raised clinic BP alone. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of masked suboptimal BP control in Saudi patients with treated and well-controlled clinic BP is high and is largely because of nocturnal hypertension. Ambulatory hypertension is also characterized by sub-clinical target organ damage, arterial stiffness, and vascular inflammation, not related with clinic BP. Therefore, ABPM should become a routine investigation to confirm BP control, especially in higher risk groups and/or those with borderline hypertension.",Excluded

Six underwent postmission optical coherence tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 4 had lumbar punctures (LP). Approximately 300 astronauts were queried regarding visual changes during space missions.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refractive change, fundus photograph examination, retina OCT, orbital MRI, LP opening pressures, and examination of visual acuity data.RESULTS: After 6 months of space flight, 7 astronauts had ophthalmic findings, consisting of disc edema in 5, globe flattening in 5, choroidal folds in 5, cotton wool spots (CWS) in 3, nerve fiber layer thickening by OCT in 6, and decreased near vision in 6 astronauts. Five of 7 with near vision complaints had a hyperopic shift >=+0.50 diopters (D) between pre/postmission spherical equivalent refraction in 1 or both eyes (range, +0.50 to +1.75 D). These 5 showed globe flattening on MRI. Lumbar punctures performed in the 4 with disc edema documented opening pressures of 22, 21, 28, and 28.5 cm H(2)O performed 60, 19, 12, and 57 days postmission, respectively. The 300 postflight questionnaires documented that approximately 29% and 60% of astronauts on short and long-duration missions, respectively, experienced a degradation in distant and near visual acuity. Some of these vision changes remain unresolved years after flight.CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the optic nerve and ocular changes we describe may result from cephalad fluid shifts brought about by prolonged microgravity exposure. The findings we report may represent parts of a spectrum of ocular and cerebral responses to extended microgravity exposure.FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The authors have no proprietary or commercial interest in any of the materials discussed in this article.",Excluded

Six patients received surgical resection followed by radiotherapy, and 12 patients received only radiotherapy. The median survival for all patients was 4.1 months (range 0.7-48.2 months), and the actuarial survival rates were 11% at both 12 months and 24 months. Univariate analysis showed that treatment modality, extracranial disease status, total radiation dose, number of brain metastases, and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) all had statistically significant impacts on survival. Two patients survived for more than 2 years, and both had single brain metastasis, inactive extracranial disease, 90-100% KPS, and were treated with surgical resection followed by radiotherapy. Improvements in neurological symptoms were observed in 10 of the 12 patients treated with palliative radiotherapy, with median duration of 3.1 months (range 1.5-4.5 months).

2747,"Encoding of stimulus frequency and sensor motion in the posterior medial thalamic nucleus In all sensory systems, information is processed along several parallel streams. In the vibrissa-to-barrel cortex system, these include the lemniscal system and the lesser-known paralemniscal system. The posterior medial nucleus (POm) is the thalamic structure associated with the latter pathway. Previous studies suggested that POm response latencies are positively correlated with stimulation frequency and negatively correlated with response duration, providing a basis for a phase locked loop-temporal decoding of stimulus frequency. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing response latencies of POm neurons, in both awake and anesthetized rats, to vibrissae deflections at frequencies between 0.3 and 11 Hz. We found no significant, systematic correlation between stimulation frequency and the latency or duration of POm responses. We obtained similar findings from recording in awake rats, in rats under different anesthetics, and in anesthetized rats in which the reticular activating system was stimulated. These findings suggest that stimulus frequency is not reliably reflected in response latency of POm neurons. We also tested the hypothesis that POm neurons respond preferentially to sensor motion, that is, they respond to whisking in air, without contacts. We recorded from awake, head-restrained rats while monitoring vibrissae movements. All POm neurons responded to passive whisker deflections, but none responded to noncontact whisking. Thus like their counterparts in the trigeminal ganglion, POm neurons may not reliably encode whisking kinematics. These observations suggest that POm neurons might not faithfully encode vibrissae inputs to provide reliable information on vibrissae movements or contacts.",Excluded
2691,"Quantifying visual pathway axonal and myelin loss in neuromyelitis optic OBJECTIVE: To determine how optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures reflecting the health of neurons (total macular volume, TMV) and axons (retinal nerve fibre layer, RNFL) relate to MRI-derived measures of myelin (myelin water fraction, MWF) in the optic radiation (OR) of individuals with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) compared to healthy controls. BACKGROUND: NMO is an autoimmune disorder characterized by episodes of inflammation and damage to astrocytes that can result in optic neuritis (ON) and transverse myelitis. The optic nerve is a frequent site for demyelination resulting in visual dysfunction which may be reflected by OCT measures of axonal health and MWF of the OR. DESIGN/METHODS: 8 eyes with ON (NMO<sup>1</sup>) and 12 eyes without ON (NMO<sup>2</sup>) from ten NMO patients (EDSS 2.06.0, mean age=43y, 3M/7F) and 24 eyes of twelve healthy subjects (mean age=31y, 3M/9F) were included. OCT assessment involved a Macular Volume protocol (volume of retina in the center 6mm of the macula) and a RNFL Thickness scan (3.4mm ring scan of retinal thickness around optic nerve). The MRI protocol included a 32-echo T2-relaxation GRASE sequence. Average MWF values were calculated within the OR. RESULT(S): RNFL thickness (NMO<sup>1</sup>:70.5+/-17.9mum; NMO<sup>2</sup>:91.3+/-8.7mum; controls:102.9+/-15.0mum) was reduced in NMO<sup>1</sup> compared to NMO<sup>2</sup> (p=0.01) and controls (p<0.0001). TMV (NMO<sup>1</sup>:7.9+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>; NMO<sup>2</sup>:8.4+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>; controls:8.9+/-0.4mm<sup>3</sup>) was reduced in NMO<sup>1</sup> compared to NMO<sup>2</sup> (p=0.02) and controls (p<0.0001). Also NMO<sup>2</sup> had reduced TMV compared to controls (p=0.02). Decreased OR MWF was also observed in NMO (NMO:0.098+/-0.01; controls:0.11+/-0.01, p=0.02). There was a strong correlation between the OR MWF and RNFL (r=0.50,p=0.003) and TMV (r=0.60,p=0.0002). CONCLUSION(S): The correspondence between reductions in OCT measures of neuronal and axonal health in the anterior visual pathway and MRI-based measures of myelin health in the posterior visual pathway suggests that these measures may be used to evaluate disease progression and treatment approaches that promote repair.",Excluded
3140,"Seizure control after radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: A 25-year experience OBJECTIVE Seizures are the second-most common presenting symptom in patients with lobar arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, few studies have assessed the long-term effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on seizure control. The authors of this study assess the outcome of SRS for these patients to identify prognostic factors associated with seizure control. METHODS Patients with AVM who presented with a history of seizure and underwent SRS at the authors' institution between 1987 and 2012 were retrospectively assessed. The total cohort included 155 patients with a mean follow-up of 86 months (range 6-295 months). Primary outcomes assessed were seizure frequency, antiepileptic drug regimen, and seizure freedom for 6 months prior to last follow-up. RESULTS Seizure-free status was achieved in 108 patients (70%), with an additional 23 patients (15%) reporting improved seizure frequency as compared to their pre-SRS status. The median time to seizure-free status was estimated to be 12 months (95% CI 0-27 months) as evaluated via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The mean seizure frequency prior to SRS was 14.2 (95% CI 5.4-23.1) episodes per year. Although not all patients tried, the proportion of patients successfully weaned off all antiepileptic drugs was 18% (28/155 patients). On multivariate logistic regression, focal impaired awareness seizure type (also known as complex partial seizures) and superficial venous drainage were significantly associated with a decreased odds ratio for seizure-free status at last follow-up (OR 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.92] for focal impaired awareness seizures; OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.16-0.81] for superficial venous drainage). The effects of superficial venous drainage on seizure outcome were nonsignificant when excluding patients with < 2 years of follow-up. AVM obliteration did not correlate with long-term seizure freedom (p = 0.202, chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that SRS improves long-term seizure control and increases the likelihood of being medication free, independently of AVM obliteration. Patients with focal impaired awareness seizures were less likely to obtain long-term seizure relief. Copyright © AANS 2019",Excluded

3097,"Significance of histology in determining management of lesions regrowing after radiosurgery Brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery may show delayed enlargement on post-treatment imaging that is of ambiguous etiology. Histopathologic interpretation of brain specimens is often challenging due to the presence of significant radiation effects admixed with irradiated residual tumor of indeterminate viability. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of histologic findings on clinical outcomes following resection of these lesions. Between 2004 and 2010, 690 patients with brain metastases were enrolled in a prospective gamma knife data repository, and lesions requiring excision were identified. Tissue specimens were divided into four groups based on the ratio of treatment related inflammatory changes (TRIC) to tumor cells, and subsequently patient outcomes were assessed. Of 2,583 metastases treated, 36 were excised due to symptomatic enlargement. Only TRIC, without residual evidence of tumor, was seen in 36 % (13/36) of specimens. Resection of these lesions resulted in 100 % local control in follow-up. Of the remaining 23 lesions that contained any viable-appearing tumor within the resected specimen, 8 recurred after resection. Lesions that enlarged in the first 6 months were more likely to contain higher amounts of residual tumor cells. Patients with even <2 % tumors cells on excision had significantly worse local control (75 vs. 100 %, p = 0.024) and survival (HR 0.27, p = 0.029) compared with those patients with exclusively TRIC. In summary, our findings underscore the importance of surgically obtaining tissue in a method that facilitates complete lesional interpretive histology in order to accurately guide ongoing patient management.",Excluded

2516,"Brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis predicts response in cancer patients with brain metastases Lymphocytopenia is one of the main toxicities of radiotherapy and its severity is related to the irradiation dose. The occurrence of lymphocytopenia depends on the body site of radiotherapy; it is most pronounced with pelvic irradiation, whereas the effect of brain irradiation on the lymphocyte count is to be elucidated. This preliminary study was performed to evaluate changes in lymphocyte number occurring during brain irradiation in cancer patients with brain metastases. The study included 50 patients who received brain radiotherapy for single or multiple brain metastases at a total dose of 30 Gy. Overall, no significant changes in mean lymphocyte number occurred during brain radiotherapy. However, when lymphocyte variations were assessed in relation to the clinical response of brain metastases, a significant increase in the mean number of lymphocytes was found in patients who achieved objective regression of brain metastases on brain irradiation. The mean lymphocyte number decreased in nonresponding patients, albeit without a statistically significant difference with respect to the pretreatment values. The results of this study show that the efficacy of radiotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is associated with a significant increase in mean lymphocyte number. Therefore, evidence of brain irradiation-induced lymphocytosis may predict the efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded
2827,"Deterministic multiplicative gain control with active dendrites Multiplicative gain control is a vital component of many theoretical analyses of neural computations, conferring the ability to scale neuronal firing rate in response to synaptic inputs. Many theories of gain control in single cells have used precisely balanced noisy inputs. Such noisy inputs can degrade signal processing. We demonstrate a deterministic method for the control of gain without the use of noise. We show that a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP), arising from active dendritic spike backpropagation, leads to a multiplicative increase in gain. Reduction of DAP amplitude by dendritic inhibition dilutes the multiplicative effect, allowing for divisive scaling of the firing rate. In contrast, somatic inhibition acts in a subtractive manner, allowing spatially distinct inhibitory inputs to perform distinct computations. The simplicity of this mechanism and the ubiquity of its elementary components suggest that many cell types have the potential to display a dendritic division of neuronal output.",Excluded

Since their discovery, HSC have been the focus of intensive research, and have proven invaluable clinically to restore hematopoiesis following inadvertent radiation exposure and following radio/chemotherapy to eliminate hematologic tumors. While they were originally discovered in the bone marrow, HSC can also be isolated from umbilical cord blood and can be ""mobilized"" peripheral blood, making them readily available in relatively large quantities. While their ability to repopulate the entire hematopoietic system would already guarantee HSC a valuable place in regenerative medicine, the finding that hematopoietic chimerism can induce immunological tolerance to solid organs and correct autoimmune diseases has dramatically broadened their clinical utility. The demonstration that these cells, through a variety of mechanisms, can also promote repair/regeneration of non-hematopoietic tissues as diverse as liver, heart, and brain has further increased their clinical value. The goal of this review is to provide the reader with a brief glimpse into the remarkable potential HSC possess, and to highlight their tremendous value as therapeutics in regenerative medicine.",Excluded
3441,"Intraoperative radiotherapy and reconstructive operations in the treatment of locally spread tumors of oral cavity Aim: to improve the results of the treatment of patients with locally spread oral cavity tumors, spreading on to neighboring anatomic structures, including skull base. Material(s) and Method(s): we proposed the variant of combined treatment of patients with head and neck tumors, including expanded operations, intraoperative radiotherapy and reconstruction-at-once in the case of primary and recurrent tumors after surgical, radiation, combined, complex treatment, just as their repeated coalition. We accumulated experience of 55 patients' treatment, for whom block resections were conducted, together with intraoperative radiotherapy in radiation doze 15 Gray (52 patients) and in radiation doze 25 Gray in the conditions of gas hypoxia (3 patients). For all the patients the spread of tumor process corresponded to T4 symbol. In 32 cases for reconstruction-at-once we used the method of microsurgical tissue autotransplantation, in 23 observations locally-relocated flaps were used. Result(s): the complications appeared in 41,2% of cases, the complications predominated in the group of patients with intracranial expansion of a tumor. Total survival rate was for 3 years - 23,3+/-6,3%; for 5 years - 14,8+/-7,0%. At the same time, there was observed reliable difference in the survival rate of patients with recurrent and primary tumors. 3 year survival rate with recurrent tumors was 15,6 +/-2,3%; with primary tumors - 39,7 +/-1,7%; 5 year survival rate - 10,41 +/- 5% and 23,8 +/- 1,4% correspondingly.",Excluded
2806,"Expression of markers for pericytes and myofibroblasts in bleomycin (BLEO)-induced dermal fibrosis: Potential role of neuropeptide receptors in a mouse model for scleroderma (SSC) Background: SSc is a chronic collagen-vascular disease that manifests initially with dermal fibrosis, then later progresses to multiple organ fibrosis. There is no treatment to arrest SSc. Recently, a mouse model of SSc was reported, in which Bleo is injected intradermally (ID) for 21-28 days. Two labs showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause this dermal fibrosis. We previously observed that ROS trigger GRP-mediated pulmonary fibrosis to hyperoxia or radiation. We first verified that ROS trigger this dermal fibrosis, and now test the hypothesis that gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) from cutaneous nerves has a role in this process by acting on myofibroblasts [alpha-smooth muscle actin, SMA+] and pericytes [SMA+ and neural/glial antigen 2, NG2+]. We tested expression of both GRP receptors, GRPR and neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) by immunohistochemistry. Design(s): Flanks of 10-wk old C3H/HeJ females were injected ID with Bleo (100-mug) 5d/wk for 3-wks. Some mice also received antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) IP, and other Bleo mice received GRP blocking mAb-2A11. After 21d, lesions paraffin sections were immunostained for SMA, NG2, GRPR, or NMBR. Relative extent of immunostaining in dermis and epidermis was scored by 2 observers (EK & MES) on a scale from 0-3, comparing prevalence of (+) cells (0, 1=detected in few cells, 2=many cells (+), & 3=most cells positive. Result(s): Bleo induced >10-fold increased pericytes & myofibroblasts, in dermis (P<0.001), and NG2 and SMA staining scores were linearly correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = .87, P<0.05). SMA & NG2 were reduced by NAC (~80% decrease, P<0.001) or mAb2A11 (~50% decrease, P<0.01), similar to our prior studies of dermal thickness. Epidermal scores for GRPR were significantly decreased in Bleo+2A11 mice compared to Bleo alone (0.5 +/- 0.3, 1.9 +/- 0.3, P < 0.005), like prior studies of GRPR up-regulation by GRP. However, there were no other differences in GRPR between study groups. NMBR scores were unchanged amongst the groups. Conclusion(s): In the mouse model of scleroderma, increased pericytes and myofibroblasts occur in regions of dermal fibrosis. Although GRPR &/or NMBR could contribute to Bleo-induced dermal fibrosis their expression is unchanged between groups. We previously determined that GRP induces GRPR gene expression. Regardless, sustained epidermal expression of both receptors would be consistent with potential GRP signaling in epidermis as a mechanism for epidermal hyperplasia and dermal fibrosis, such as through epithelial-mesenchymal transformation.",Excluded
3194,"Cerebral cyst formation following stereotactic ablative irradiation for non-nasopharyngeal head and neck malignancies: imaging findings and relevant dosimetric parameters OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics, imaging findings and relevant dosimetric parameters of cases presenting with cerebral cyst formation (CCF) after single or oligo-fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for non-nasopharyngeal head and neck malignancies (HNMs).METHODS: We identified four cases with the follow-up duration of 5.7-9.1 years from SRT. The irradiated sites included the middle ear in one case and the ethmoid sinus in three cases, two of the latter possessed brain invasion. The chronological changes in MR images and the dose-volume histogram of the adjacent brain tissue were evaluated.RESULTS: CCF with or without multiple septi presented with a latency of 29-86 months (median, 45.5 months), which was preceded by either non-specific parenchymal enhancement or typical radiation necrosis. In three cases, CCF adjacent to the frontal base resultantly caused mass effect, and two of these three cases required surgical intervention at 38 and 54 months, respectively, after SRT for alleviation of symptoms. The relation of the irradiated brain volumes to the biological equivalent dose based on the linear-quadratic (LQ) and LQ-cubic models was represented as a threshold.CONCLUSION: When contemplating SRT for HNM cases, caution should be exercised to the dose-volume relation-ship of the adjacent brain tissue, especially the frontal base, as well as other critical structures, and long-term vigilant follow-up is also mandatory.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: CCF can occur as an unusual consequence of late brain injury with variable but mostly long latency following SRT for non-nasopharyngeal HNMs adjacent to the brain, even superficial parts that were previously irradiated via conventional radiotherapy.",Excluded
2917,"Bnct combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas INTRODUCTION: Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control. We have often treated RMGs using tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN, we herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT, and evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. METHOD(S): Two cohorts were included. The first and second cohorts were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, and between August 2017 and December 2017, respectively. They were followed by successive BV treatments. The first cohort was composed of 7 patients with RMGs (4 grade 4 and 3 grade 3 cases). The second cohort was composed of 6 patients with RMGs (5 grade 4 and 1 grade 3 cases). They were followed-up to April 2018. RESULT(S): Median OS and PFS after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively in the 1st cohort. Those in the second cohort were not reached. The OS data was compared with RPA classification for RMG as advocated by Carson et al. in a 2007 article in JCO. In both cohorts no symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred if BV could be continued. CTCAE grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments. Totally 11cases' OS in both cohorts were compared using JCO's RPA classification. Nine out of 11 cases showed longer OS in comparison with corresponding JCO's RPA classes. CONCLUSION(S): BNCT followed by BV treatments well-prevented or well-controlled BRN with prolonged OS and acceptable incidence of adverse events in our patients with RMG.",Excluded
2907,"Radiotherapy of painful vertebral hemangiomas: the single center retrospective analysis of 137 cases PURPOSE: An evaluation of dose-response relationship and an attempt to define predictive factors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 137 cases of painful vertebral hemangioma irradiations (101 patients). Fraction dose (fd) varied from 2 to 15 Gy (123 fractionated and 14 radiosurgical treatments), and total dose (TD) from 8 to 30 Gy (111 cases irradiated with fd of 2 GY to TD of 24 Gy). We evaluated pain relief, changes in analgesic requirements, and reossification.RESULTS: Means of pain relief 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after radiotherapy (defined as a decrease of primary pain level expressed in percent) were 60.5%, 65.4%, 68.3%, and 78.4%, respectively. Proportion of patients with no need for analgesics and patients using tramadol were 39%, 40%, 44%, 57%, and 20%, 17%, 22%, and 11% in these times. The proportion of patients experiencing complete/partial pain relief changed from 36/48% 1 month, to 64/22% 1.5 years after radiotherapy. No impact of radiotherapy on reossification was found. The positive impact of fd and TD increase for analgesics uptake reduction and pain relief was found. An increase of the fd by 1 Gy results in 27% chance of analgesics uptake reduction and 3.8% reduction of pain, whereas 14% analgesics uptake reduction and 2.2% of pain reduction in case of the TD. The predictive factors improving results were found: female gender, older age, better performance states (the chance of the lower analgesic treatment decreases over 2.5 times in comparison to the higher Zubrod degree), bigger Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data support the efficacy of radiotherapy in improving pain secondary to vertebral hemangioma, with the degree of pain amelioration being related to increasing fd and TD. The positive predictive factors were defined: female gender, older age, better performance status, increased Hb concentration, shorter symptoms duration, and lower analgesics uptake before radiotherapy.",Excluded
2835,"Action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the isolated photosensory pineal organ The effect of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), its agonists (muscimol, baclofen) and antagonist (bicuculline) on pineal ganglion cells of the luminosity type were studied in the isolated, superfused pineal organ of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Extracellular recordings revealed that GABA added through the superfusion medium caused a clear alteration of the activity of projecting neurons, which transmit luminosity responses to the brain. Spontaneous discharges of ganglion cells were predominantly suppressed by GABA (33 neurons out of 48), but 10 neurons were clearly excited. Similar effects were observed after addition of muscimol, but not of baclofen. Bicuculline reversed the GABA and muscimol induced inhibition or excitation. In 4 neurons of the luminosity type, GABA caused bidirectional, inhibitory and excitatory responses depending on the state of light- or dark-adaptation. These observations suggest a role of a GABAergic mechanism in the generation and transmission of luminosity responses in the trout pineal organ. It appears that GABA participates in the modulation of light sensitivity during light- and dark-adaptation processes and that this action is mediated by GABAA receptors.",Excluded

3553,"Extremely low frequency magnetic field induced changes in motor behaviour of gerbils submitted to global cerebral ischemia The purpose of this study was to evaluate behavioural effects of an extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) in 3-month-old Mongolian gerbils submitted to global cerebral ischemia. After 10-min occlusion of both common carotid arteries, the gerbils were placed in the vicinity of an electromagnet and continuously exposed to ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) for 7 days. Their behaviour (locomotion, stereotypy, rotations, and immobility) was monitored on days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 after reperfusion for 60min in the open field. It was shown that the 10-min global cerebral ischemia per se induced a significant motor activity increase (locomotion, stereotypy and rotations), and consequently immobility decrease until day 4 after reperfusion, compared to control gerbils. Exposure to ELF-MF inhibited development of ischemia-induced motor hyperactivity during the whole period of registration, but significantly in the first 2 days after reperfusion, when the postischemic hyperactivity was most evident. Motor activity of these gerbils was still significantly increased compared to control ones, but only on day 1 after reperfusion. Our results revealed that the applied ELF-MF (50Hz, 0.5mT) decreased motor hyperactivity induced by the 10-min global cerebral ischemia, via modulation of the processes that underlie this behavioural response.",Excluded
3034,"Lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR): dosimetric considerations for chest wall toxicity OBJECTIVE: To investigate chest wall pain in patients with peripheral early stage lung cancer treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), and to identify factors predictive of Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events Grade 2 + chest wall pain.METHODS: Patients who received 55 Gy in five fractions were included. A chest wall structure was retrospectively defined on planning scans, and chest wall dosimetry and tumour-related factors recorded. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors predictive of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain.RESULTS: 182 patients and 187 tumours were included. There were 20 (10.9%) episodes of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that the maximum dose received by 1 cm(3) of chest wall (Dmax1 cm(3)) and tumour size were significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain [Dmax1 cm(3) odds ratio : 1.104, 95% confidence interval : 1.012-1.204, p = 0.025; tumour size (mm) odds ratio : 1.080, 95% confidence interval : 1.026-1.136, p = 0.003]. This model was an adequate fit to the data (Hosmer and Lemeshow test non-significant) and a fair discriminator for chest wall pain (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.74). Using the multivariate logistic regression model, parameters for Dmax1 cm(3) are provided, which predict <10% and <20% risks of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain for different tumour sizes.CONCLUSION: Grade 2+ chest wall pain is an uncommon side effect of lung SABR. Larger tumour size and increasing Dmax1 cm(3) are significant predictors of >=Grade 2 chest wall pain. When planning lung SABR, it is prudent to try to avoid hot volumes in the chest wall, particularly for larger tumours.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This article demonstrates that Grade 2 or greater chest wall pain following lung SABR is more common when the tumour is larger in size and the Dmax1 cm(3) of the chest wall is higher. When planning lung SABR, the risk of chest wall pain may be reduced if maximum doses are minimized, particularly for larger tumours.",Excluded

In consideration of these trends, the objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of transcranial laser therapy with continuous-wave (CW) near-infrared laser light (wavelength, 808 +/- 10 nm, 2-mm diameter) with a nominal radiant power of 70 mW; power density, 2,230 mW/cm(2), and energy density, 268 J/cm(2) at the scalp (10 mW/cm(2) and 1.2 J/cm(2) at the cerebral cortical surface) in healthy Sprague-Dawley rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 120 anesthetized rats received sequential transcranial laser treatments to the right and left parietal areas of the head on the same day (minimum of 5 min between irradiation of each side), on either Day 1 or on each of Days 1, 3, and 5. Sixty anesthetized rats served as sham controls. Rats were evaluated 1 year after treatment for abnormalities in clinical hematology and brain and pituitary gland histopathology.RESULTS: No toxicologically important differences were found in the clinical hematology results between sham-control and laser-treated rats for any hematologic parameters examined. All values fell within historic control reference ranges for aged Sprague-Dawley rats. Similarly, brain and pituitary gland histopathology showed no treatment-related abnormalities or induced neoplasia.CONCLUSIONS: Single and multiple applications of transcranial laser therapy with 808-nm CW laser light at a nominal power density of 10 mW/cm(2) at the surface of the cerebral cortex appears to be safe in Sprague-Dawley rats 1 year after treatment.",Excluded

This matched-pair analysis compared whole-brain irradiation plus radiosurgery (WBI + RS) to neurosurgical resection followed by whole-brain irradiation and a boost to the metastatic site (NR + WBI + B). Method(s): The data of 46 patients treated with WBI + RS were matched 1:1 to 46 patients treated with NR + WBI + B with respect to age, gender, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), tumor type, extracerebral metastases, and interval from first diagnosis of cancer to treatment of the metastasis, RPA class, and GPA score. Both groups were compared for local control of the treated metastasis, intracerebral control, and survival. Result(s): The 1-year local control rates were 85% after WBI + RS and 78% after NR + WBI + B (p = 0.35). The 1-year intracerebral control rates were 74% and 68% (p = 0.33), respectively. The 1-year survival rates were 64% and 58% (p = 0.70), respectively. A multivariate analysis was not performed for local and intracerebral control, because no factor achieved significance on univariate analyses for these endpoints. Improved survival was associated with KPS > 70 (p = 0.032), absence of extracerebral metastases (p = 0.003), RPA-class 1 (p = 0.014), and GPA score of 3.0-4.0 (p = 0.010).

3468,"Disorder in Pixel-Level Edge Directions on T1WI Is Associated with the Degree of Radiation Necrosis in Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors: Preliminary Findings BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Co-occurrence of local anisotropic gradient orientations (COLLAGE) is a recently developed radiomic (computer extracted) feature that captures entropy (measures the degree of disorder) in pixel-level edge directions and was previously shown to distinguish predominant cerebral radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor on gadolinium-contrast T1WI. In this work, we sought to investigate whether COLLAGE measurements from posttreatment gadolinium-contrast T1WI could distinguish varying extents of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor classes in a lesion across primary and metastatic brain tumors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: On a total of 75 gadolinium-contrast T1WI studies obtained from patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the extent of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor in every brain lesion was histopathologically defined by an expert neuropathologist as the following: 1) ""pure"" cerebral radiation necrosis; 2) ""mixed"" pathology with coexistence of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumors; 3) ""predominant"" (>80%) cerebral radiation necrosis; 4) predominant (>80%) recurrent tumor; and 5) pure tumor. COLLAGE features were extracted from the expert-annotated ROIs on MR imaging. Statistical comparisons of COLLAGE measurements using first-order statistics were performed across pure, mixed, and predominant pathologies of cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.RESULTS: COLLAGE features exhibited decreased skewness for patients with pure (0.15 +/- 0.12) and predominant cerebral radiation necrosis (0.25 +/- 0.09) and were statistically significantly different (P < .05) from those in patients with predominant recurrent tumors, which had highly skewed (0.42 +/- 0.21) COLLAGE values. COLLAGE values for the mixed pathology studies were found to lie between predominant cerebral radiation necrosis and recurrent tumor categories.CONCLUSIONS: With additional independent multisite validation, COLLAGE measurements might enable noninvasive characterization of the degree of recurrent tumor or cerebral radiation necrosis in gadolinium-contrast T1WI of posttreatment lesions.",Excluded
2469,"Laser irradiation activates spinal adenosine A1 receptor to alleviate osteoarthritis pain in monosodium iodoacetate injected rats The analgesic role of the adenosine A1 receptor is thought to involve the modulation of the spinal N-methyl D-aspartate receptor-mediated nociceptive pathway, which is suggested to be an underlying mechanism in chronic pain. Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition accompanied by chronic pain. We have demonstrated that 10.6-mum laser irradiation has an antinociceptive effect in the monosodium iodoacetate -induced knee osteoarthritis in rats. However, its mechanism of action has yet to be explored. In the present work, we investigate the mechanism of 10.6-mum laser irradiation mediated antinociception in the monosodium iodoacetate -induced knee osteoarthritis. Results showed that the 10.6-mum laser significantly reversed the monosodium iodoacetate -induced nociceptive behaviors for up to 28 days. Moreover, the up-regulation of the A1 receptor and the down-regulated phosphorylation of the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor 1 subunit of the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor were observed in the spinal cord dorsal horn in the monosodium iodoacetate injected rats treated by laser irradiation. Intrathecal injection of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine markedly reversed the effects of laser irradiation, as evidenced both by behavioral pain tests and by levels of spinal phosphorylation of N-methyl D-aspartate receptor 1. These results suggest that the spinal A1 receptor contributes to the antinociceptive effects of 10.6-mum laser, at least in part by inhibiting phosphorylation of N-methyl D-aspartate receptor 1 in the monosodium iodoacetate -induced knee osteoarthritis pain.",Excluded

3594,"Space flight and neurovestibular adaptation Space flight represents a form of sensory stimulus rearrangement requiring modification of established terrestrial response patterns through central reinterpretation. Evidence of sensory reinterpretation is manifested as postflight modifications of eye/head coordination, locomotor patterns, postural control strategies, and illusory perceptions of self or surround motion in conjunction with head movements. Under normal preflight conditions, the head is stabilized during locomotion, but immediately postflight reduced head stability, coupled with inappropriate eye/head coordination, results in modifications of gait. Postflight postural control exhibits increased dependence on vision which compensates for inappropriate interpretation of otolith and proprioceptive inputs. Eye movements compensatory for perceived self motion, rather than actual head movements have been observed postflight. Overall, the in-flight adaptive modification of head stabilization strategies, changes in head/eye coordination, illusionary motion, and postural control are maladaptive for a return to the terrestrial environment.

3371,"Cutaneous pain and detection thresholds to short CO2 laser pulses in humans: evidence on afferent mechanisms and the influence of varying stimulus conditions Pain and detection thresholds to short CO2 laser pulses were studied in healthy human subjects. Pain thresholds were significantly higher than detection thresholds in both hairy and glabrous skin; in the glabrous skin both thresholds were higher in the hairy skin. The range from detection threshold to pain threshold was larger in the glabrous skin. The minimal energy per surface area needed to produce any sensation (detection) or pain sensation decreased with increasing stimulus surface, and this spatial summation effect was to equal magnitude in the hairy and the glabrous skin. With decreasing stimulus pulse duration (from 45 to 15 msec) the detection and pain thresholds were elevated: this effect was stronger on pain thresholds. With increasing adapting skin temperature, less energy was needed to produce any sensation (detection) or pain sensation. The effect of adapting skin temperature was equal on pain and detection thresholds. The conduction velocity of fibers mediating laser evoked first sensations was in the thin fiber range (less than 10 msec), according to a reaction time study. The results suggest that short CO2 laser pulses produce both non-pain and pain sensations, but that both these sensations are based on the activation of the same primary afferent fiber population of slowly conducting nociceptive fibers. Central summation of primary afferent impulses is needed to elicit a liminal non-painful sensation, and an increased number of impulses in the same fibers produces pain.",Excluded
2570,"Optical clearing potential of immersion-based agents applied to thick mouse brain sections We have previously demonstrated that the use of a commercially-available immersion-based optical clearing agent (OCA) enables, within 3-6 hours, three-dimensional visualization of subsurface exogenous fluorescent and absorbing markers of vascular architecture and neurodegenerative disease in thick (0.5-1.0mm) mouse brain sections. Nonetheless, the relative performance of immersion-based OCAs has remained unknown. Here, we show that immersion of brain sections in specific OCAs (FocusClear, RIMS, sRIMS, or ScaleSQ) affects both their transparency and volume; the optical clearing effect occurs over the entire visible spectrum and is reversible; and that ScaleSQ had the highest optical clearing potential and increase in imaging depth of the four evaluated OCAs, albeit with the largest change in sample volume and a concomitant decrease in apparent microvascular density of the sample. These results suggest a rational, quantitative framework for screening and characterization of the impact of optical clearing, to streamline experimental design and enable a cost-benefit assessment.",Excluded
2460,"Spatial distribution of brain microhemorrhage resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) Introduction Microhemorrhages, commonly found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of TBI, appear as punctuate hypointense foci on susceptibility weighted images (SWI). To better understand the spatial distribution of microhemorrhages, we map their locations to a normalized space and apply region of interest (ROI) analysis using brain atlases. Methods MRI was performed in a series of 46 sequential patients enrolled in a natural history study of TBI. Susceptibility weighted (TR = 64ms, TE = 25ms, FA = 20degree, 0.49 x 0.49 x 2.0 mm) and 3D T1-MPRAGE (TR = 25ms, TE = 3.03ms, FA = 7degree, 1 x 1 x 1 mm) images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Biograph mMR in all patients. SWI images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist on a Carestream PACS workstation, and microhemorrhages were labeled using the ""marker"" graphic tool. To characterize their spatial distribution in standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, the T1-MPRAGE was affine registered to the MNI template. This transformation was applied to the co-registered SWI images and to the marker coordinates. The frequency of microhemorrhages in major brain structures was determined from ROIs using the digital Talairach brain atlas. Similarly, the frequency of microhemorrhage in labeled white matter (WM) tracts was performed by applying the Diffusion Oriented Tract Segmentation method to the image within MNI space. Results A total of 629 microhemorrhages were identified. An average of 13 +/- 34 (range = 1 +/- 179) microhemorrhages were present in the 24 positive patients out of all 46 cases. Microhemorrhages congregated around the periphery of the brain and were symmetrically distributed. Using Talairach ROI analysis, microhemorrhages were most prevalent in the frontal lobes 60% (377). The remaining lobar distribution was temporal: 10% (63), parietal 1.3% (8), occipital: 4.7% (30), limbic: 3.6% (23). Sublobar distribution was brainstem: 1.4% (9), cerebellum: 4.8% (31), deep cerebral WM: 6.8% (43), thalamus and basal ganglia: 1.3% (8). Microhemorrhages in WM tracts contributed 61% (384) in total. Restricting the analysis to WM tracts, microhemorrhages were primarily found in the corpus callosum 40.3% (253). Other WM tracts with notable proportions ( > 4%) include the anterior thalamic radiation: 4.3% (27), cortico-pontine tract: 4.4% (28), inferior frontooccipital fasciculus: 13.4% (84), inferior longitudinal fasciculus: 5.5% (35), middle cerebellar peduncle 9.1% (57), superior fronto-occipital fasciculus 8% (50), and uncinate fasciculus 4.4% (28). We note, however, that because white matter tracts are relatively small structures and the alignment was performed using only an affine transformation, these results should be considered as preliminary. Conclusions This study examines the spatial distribution of microhemorrhages in 24 TBI patients. Microhemorrhages were distributed mostly around the periphery of the brain, and were particularly common in the frontal lobes. Such a finding is likely due to many of these injuries resulting from motor vehicle accidents, possibly with head-on collisions. In the WM tract analysis, the corpus callosum was implicated as a WM pathway that may be vulnerable to damage. Future work will expand the analysis to additional subjects, as well as examine distribution differences between impact and blast injuries. The relationship between microhemorrhage location and neurobehavioral symptoms requires further study.",Excluded

3472,"Targeted sequencing and intracranial outcomes of patients with lung adenocarcinoma brain metastases treated with radiotherapy BACKGROUND: Treatment for advanced lung adenocarcinoma (AC) has become increasingly personalized based on molecular results. However, for patients with AC brain metastases (BMs), intracranial outcomes based on molecular subtype and the frequency of molecular aberrations are less well defined. This study sought to report targeted next-generation sequencing results and investigate molecularly based outcomes for patients with AC-BMs treated with radiotherapy.METHODS: The records of 132 patients with AC-BMs treated at Emory University from September 2008 to August 2016 with successful next-generation sequencing were reviewed. Rates of local disease recurrence, distant brain failure (DBF), and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were estimated using cumulative incidence with competing risk analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.RESULTS: The most common aberrations included tumor protein 53 (TP53) (60%), KRAS (29%), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (20.5%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss (15.5%), and MET amplification (13%). The majority of patients (62%) were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery alone. In these patients, KRAS mutation, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, and having >= 6 BMs were associated with an increased risk of salvage WBRT (P < .05). KRAS mutation remained significant for an increased risk of salvage WBRT when compared with EGFR/ALK/KRAS-negative patients (hazard ratio, 5.17; P < .05), despite a similar risk of DBF. PTEN loss was associated with increased risk of DBF (P < .05), whereas EGFR and ALK aberrations were associated with a decreased risk of local disease recurrence (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study quantified the frequency of genetic aberrations in patients with AC-BMs and demonstrated their association with intracranial outcomes. In particular, a cohort of patients with KRAS mutations and >=6 BMs were identified to be at high risk of requiring salvage WBRT after undergoing upfront stereotactic radiosurgery.",Excluded

The advantage of such slice cultures relies on the conservation of an organotypic environment, the easy treatment and observation by live-imaging microscopy, and the independence from genetic immortalization strategies used to generate cell lines. Rat brains as well as human tumors were cut into 300-mum-thick sections and cultivated in an incubator in a humidified atmosphere at 37 degrees C. This is realized by a membrane-based culture system with a liquid-air interface. With this system, it is possible to keep rodent slices viable for several months. Human brain tumor slices remained vital for at least 21 days. Slices were irradiated with X-rays at the radiation facility of the University Hospital in Frankfurt/Main at doses up to 40 Gy. Heavy ion irradiations were performed at GSI (Darmstadt) with different ions, energies, and doses. The irradiated slices were analyzed by 3D-confocal microscopy following immunostaining for DNA damage, microglia, and proliferation markers.

Three microcirculatory parameters: blood-brain barrier permeability, leukocyte behavior and plasma velocity were measured before and after RF-EMF exposure using a closed cranial window method.RESULTS: No extravasation of intravenously injected dyes from pial venules was found at any BASAR level. No significant changes in the number of endothelial-adhering leukocytes after exposure were found. The plasma velocity remained constant within the physiological range through each exposure.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that there were no effects on the cerebral microcirculation under the given RF-EMF exposure conditions.",Excluded

As with ionizing radiation, no defect has been observed in the overall rejoining of single or double-strand breaks produced by bleomycin. Since, however, only apyrimidinic (and to a lesser extent apurinic) sites and strand breaks are known to be produced by bleomycin, we tentatively suggest that AT cells are unable to rejoin a very small fraction of the total strand breaks.

The aim of this retrospective observational study was to use biological optimization objectives for a modeling exercise with simultaneously-integrated boost IMRT (SIB-IMRT) to generate a dose-escalated protocol with acceptable late radiation toxicity risk estimate and improve tumor control for brainstem tumors in dogs safely. We re-planned 20 dog brainstem tumor datasets with SIB-IMRT, prescribing 20 x 2.81 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and 20 x 2.5 Gy to the planning target volume. During the optimization process, we used biologically equivalent generalized equivalent uniform doses (gEUD) as planning aids. These were derived from human data, calculated to adhere to normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) <=5%, and converted to the herein used fractionation schedule. We extracted the absolute organ at risk dose-volume histograms to calculate NTCP of each individual plan. For planning optimization, gEUD<sub>(a = 4) </sub> = 39.8 Gy for brain and gEUD<sub>(a = 6.3) </sub> = 43.8 Gy for brainstem were applied. Mean brain NTCP was low with 0.43% (SD +/-0.49%, range 0.01-2.04%); mean brainstem NTCP was higher with 7.18% (SD +/-4.29%, range 2.87-20.72%). Nevertheless, NTCP of < 10% in brainstem was achievable in 80% (16/20) of dogs. Spearman's correlation between relative GTV and NTCP was high (rho = 0.798, P < .001), emphasizing increased risk with relative size even with subvolume-boost. Including biologically based gEUD values into optimization allowed estimating NTCP during the planning process. In conclusion, gEUD-based SIB-IMRT planning resulted in dose-escalated treatment plans with acceptable risk estimate of NTCP < 10% in the majority of dogs with brainstem tumors.

Consolidation cytarabine was given after the radiotherapy. The primary end point was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving rdWBRT. Exploratory end points included prospective neuropsychological evaluation, analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) white matter changes using the Fazekas scale, and evaluation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a prognostic factor.RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled, with median age of 60 years (range, 30 to 79 years) and median Karnofsky performance score of 70 (range, 50 to 100). Thirty-one patients (60%) achieved a CR after R-MPV and received rdWBRT. The 2-year PFS for this group was 77%; median PFS was 7.7 years.

3537,"A tracking system to calculate patient skin dose in real-time during neurointerventional procedures using a biplane x-ray imaging system Purpose: Neurovascular interventional procedures using biplane fluoroscopic imaging systems can lead to increased risk of radiation-induced skin injuries. The authors developed a biplane dose tracking system (Biplane-DTS) to calculate the cumulative skin dose distribution from the frontal and lateral x-ray tubes and display it in real-time as a color-coded map on a 3D graphic of the patient for immediate feedback to the physician. The agreement of the calculated values with the dose measured on phantoms was evaluated. Method(s): The Biplane-DTS consists of multiple components including 3D graphic models of the imaging system and patient, an interactive graphical user interface, a data acquisition module to collect geometry and exposure parameters, the computer graphics processing unit, and functions for determining which parts of the patient graphic skin surface are within the beam and for calculating dose. The dose is calculated to individual points on the patient graphic using premeasured calibration files of entrance skin dose per mAs including backscatter; corrections are applied for field area, distance from the focal spot and patient table and pad attenuation when appropriate. The agreement of the calculated patient skin dose and its spatial distribution with measured values was evaluated in 2D and 3D for simulated procedure conditions using a PMMA block phantom and an SK-150 head phantom, respectively. Dose values calculated by the Biplane-DTS were compared to the measurements made on the phantom surface with radiochromic film and a calibrated ionization chamber, which was also used to calibrate the DTS. The agreement with measurements was specifically evaluated with variation in kVp, gantry angle, and field size. Result(s): The dose tracking system that was developed is able to acquire data from the two x-ray gantries on a biplane imaging system and calculate the skin dose for each exposure pulse to those vertices of a patient graphic that are determined to be in the beam. The calculations are done in real-time with a typical graphic update time of 30 ms and an average vertex separation of 3 mm.With appropriate corrections applied, the Biplane-DTS was able to determine the entrance dose within 6% and the spatial distribution of the dose within 4% compared to the measurements with the ionization chamber and film for the SK150 head phantom. The cumulative dose for overlapping fields from both gantries showed similar agreement. Conclusion(s): The Biplane-DTS can provide a good estimate of the peak skin dose and cumulative skin dose distribution during biplane neurointerventional procedures. Real-time display of this information should help the physician manage patient dose to reduce the risk of radiation-induced skin injuries.

2816,"Results of contemporary surgical management of radiation necrosis using frameless stereotaxis and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging OBJECTIVE: Radiation necrosis is a well-known complication of radiotherapy for malignant brain tumors. Although surgery was once considered the mainstay of treatment, no recent reports have evaluated the use of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (IOMRI) and frameless stereotaxis during surgical resection of radiation necrosis. In this retrospective review, we evaluate the effectiveness of surgical resection using frameless stereotaxis and IOMRI for the treatment of radiation necrosis.METHODS: From October 1999 through February 2002, 11 patients who had malignant brain tumors underwent surgery for radiation necrosis. The diagnosis of radiation necrosis was based primarily on MRI and clinical suspicion. Frameless stereotaxis was used in all patients and IOMRI was used in nine. All patients underwent at least one radiation treatment before surgery and nine patients had multiple treatments. Patient outcome was based on changes in steroid dose, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), and neurologic deficit.RESULTS: Optimal resection as confirmed by IOMRI was achieved in all patients by the use of frameless stereotaxis alone; no additional resection was performed in any patient. For nine patients taking steroids (mean preoperative dose 24 mg/day) before treatment of necrosis, all had a substantial reduction in steroid dosage (mean postoperative dose 8 mg/day) after surgical treatment. Postoperatively, KPS improved in four patients, remained stable in four, and worsened in three. Three complications that resulted from surgery included wound infection, asymptomatic carotid dissection, and pulmonary embolism; thus, overall morbidity including both surgical complications and neurologic deterioration was 54%.CONCLUSIONS: In this review, frameless stereotaxis was helpful in guiding the surgeon; however, IOMRI did not provide any additional benefit for the surgical treatment of radiation necrosis. Surgical treatment of radiation necrosis was associated with high risks of complication or neurologic deficit. Given the success of medical therapies, including hyperbaric oxygen, we believe that surgical treatment of radiation necrosis should be reserved for symptomatic patients in whom medical therapy has failed.",Excluded

[French] The authors present the results of a randomized study of 33 patients suffering from small cell carcinoma of the lung. After a similar course of monthly chemo-therapy (Endoxan, Oncovin, Natulan, CCNU) and mediastinal irradiation in a dose of 30 grays in 10 fractions over 2 weeks, 14 patients were given adjuvant cerebral irradiation, the 19 others made up the control group (30 grays to the brain overall in 10 fractions over 2 weeks). With a minimum follow up for 12 months, 42% of the control group had evidence of cerebral secondaries, as opposed to none in the irradiated group with no neurological signs whatsoever. The indisputable efficacy of adjuvant cerebral irradiation contrasts with the absence of any significant improvement in survival time: 2 patients are alive and in complete remission, 1 in each group, while the mean survival was 12.3 and 11.7 months respectively. This is explained by the continued occurrence of extra-cerebral metastatic deposits such as in the liver or mediastinum where the efficacy of systemic therapy remains uncertain. The therapeutic approach is currently orientated in 2 directions: to raise to dose delivered to the mediastinum even if it appears radiologically normal, and to continue research into new chemo-therapeutic combinations more specifically active at the hepatic level.",Excluded

This technique holds great potential for replacing or complementing standard stimulation techniques, due to the potential for increased localization of the stimulus and minimization of mechanical contact with the tissue. However, optical approaches are limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate deep into tissues. Moreover, thermal modelling suggests that cumulative heating effects might be potentially hazardous when multiple stimulus sites or high laser repetition rates are used. The protocol outlined below describes an enhanced approach to the infrared stimulation of neuronal cells. The underlying mechanism is based on the transient heating associated with the optical absorption of gold nanorods, which can cause triggering of neuronal cell differentiation and increased levels of intracellular calcium activity.

3511,"Thymoquinone induces cell killing in glioblastoma cells through generation of DNA damage and cell cycle arrest Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common type of brain tumor in humans. Surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy is the current standard treatment; however, due to the upregulation of several survival pathways, tumor recurrence is quite common with a median survival of 12 to 15 months. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of glioblastoma. Naturally occurring phytochemicals have steadily received much scientific attention, owing to the fact that many of these compounds have potent action against tumors. Thymoquinone (TQ) is the bioactive compound of the volatile oil extracted from the black seed, Nigella sativa. TQ has shown anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic actions with a selective cytotoxicity for human cancer cells compared to several normal cells. Here, we show that TQ is able to dose-dependently inhibit colony formation in three distinct glioblastoma cell lines (T98, U87 and Gli36), with the highly tumorigenic Gli36 being the most sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of TQ. We also show that TQ induces persistent -H2AX activation, a marker of DNA double strand breaks, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TQ also causes G2/M cell cycle arrest in GBM cells to a degree that correlates with the cells' relative clonogenic sensitivity. Moreover, co-treatment with TQ and N-acetyl cysteine, a simple thiol nucleophile and antioxidant, prevented cell death, DNA double strand breaks, and cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that TQ is a potent inhibitor of GBM cell proliferation and growth, and that this effect may be mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species.",Excluded

To verify the proposed method, we train and test the CNN using axially averaged data of existing thin-slice CT images as input and their middle slice as the label. Fifty-two CT studies are used as the CNN training set, and 13 CT studies are used as the test set. We perform five-fold cross-validation to confirm the performance consistency.

We assess the performance of the proposed method with respect to the resolution and contrast, as well as the noise properties. The CNN generates output images that are virtually equivalent to the ground truth. The most remarkable image-recovery improvement by the CNN is deblurring of boundaries of bone structures and air cavities. The CNN output yields an approximately 10% higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and lower normalized root mean square error than the input (thicker slices). The CNN output noise level is lower than the ground truth and equivalent to the iterative image reconstruction result.

Material(s) and Method(s): This is a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with mild tSAH presenting between January 2017 and July 2019. A total of 101 and 140 patients met the eligibility criteria for the first and second subgroups, respectively. Common inclusion criteria were isolated mild tSAH, Glasgow Coma Scale between 13 and 15, and neurological stability. Additional inclusion criteria for the first subgroup were availability of brain imaging at the outside institution prior to transfer and the second subgroup was the availability of follow-up imaging. Result(s): In the first subgroup, 76.20% of patients had stable SAH, 18.80% had reduced SAH, while 5% had an interval increase in SAH. None required any surgical intervention. Additional per-patient mean radiation exposure was 1.77 +/- 0.26 mSv. In the second subgroup, all 140 patients had complete resolution of tSAH.

As such, it is likely that such genetically modified MSCs may represent the next stage of regenerative therapy. Indeed, increasing volumes of preclinical research suggests that such modified MSCs expressing growth factors can effectively treat many forms of tissue damage. In the present review, we survey recent approaches to producing and utilizing growth factor gene-modified MSCs in the context of tissue repair and discuss its prospects for clinical application.

3453,"A method of surgical laser treatment of trigeminal neuralgia Introduction: If conservative therapy in patients with trigeminal neuralgia is ineffective, different kinds of destruction of peripheral branches (alcoholization, phenol destructions, electric coagulation, etc.) are commonly used with subsequent development of marked perifocal cicatricial-commissural changes. Material(s) and Method(s): On the basis of advantages of high-energy laser radiation, we developed a method for treating trigeminal neuralgia by means of puncture laser destruction (neurotomy) of peripheral trigeminal branches on different levels. At first, a peripheral branch was blocked; if there was a positive clinical effect in the form of disappearance or significant reduction of a colicky pain, an optical quartz fibre 200-400 nm in diameter was inserted through an internal lumen of an intraneurally placed injection needle. The above quartz optical fibre serves for laser radiation influence with wavelength of 980 nm in a continuous mode using fractional portions by 2-4 seconds with an interval of 8-10 seconds and radiation power from 2 to 7 W until deep or total anaesthesia was achieved in the innervation area of a relevant nerve. Depending upon the diameter of a nerve, from 200 to 600 J were required. If necessary, the position of a needle with an optical fibre was changed, thereby causing a new focus of laser destruction until the required degree of innervation was achieved. During one operation it was possible to carry out laser destruction (neurotomy) of several nerve trunks. Result(s): From April 2011 to May 2012, 30 patients received treatment with use of a method of laser neurotomy of peripheral trigeminal branches. A positive effect was achieved in 27 cases. No complications were observed in the immediate and remote postoperative periods. Relapses were registered in 6 patients.",Excluded

Prolonged survival even with therapy is uncommon. Method(s): We report a case of anaplastic oligodendroglioma metastatic to bone with a dramatic and durable response to temozolomide therapy. A retrospective case review, molecular analysis, and literature search were performed. Result(s): The patient presented with a right frontal mass in 1990. Progression led to resection of the lesion in 1995. Histology revealed an anaplastic oligodendroglioma and the tumour was found to have allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 1p (1p-). He received standard radiation therapy. In 2000 he developed hip and pelvic pain. A bone scan showed multiple skeletal lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed stability of intracranial disease. Resection of one lesion found metastatic anaplastic oligodendroglioma with identical morphology to the patient's original tumour, including glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. The patient was started on standard temozolomide chemotherapy and celecoxib with prompt pain relief, and rapid normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase. He received a total of 12 cycles of combined therapy with no toxicity and no evidence of progression until increasing pain marked disease recurrence. The patient underwent palliative chemo- and radiation therapy but eventually succumbed. Discussion(s): Loss of heterozygosity 1p- is associated with prolonged survival in anaplastic oligodendroglioma and may increase the cumulative risk for development of systemic metastases. We speculate that metastases from oligodendroglioma harbouring loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 1p- retain the chemosensitivity of the initial lesion.",Excluded
2680,"Time course of photo-induced Egr-1 expression in the hypothalamus of a seasonally breeding songbird Many seasonally-breeding species use daylength to time reproduction. Light-induced release of progonadal hormones involves a complex cascade of responses both inside and outside the brain. In this study, we used induction of early growth response 1 (Egr-1), the protein product of an immediate early gene, to evaluate the time course of such responses in male white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) exposed to a single long day. Induction of Egr-1 in the pars tuberalis began ~11h after dawn. This response was followed ~6h later by dramatic induction in the tuberal hypothalamus, including in the ependymal cells lining the third ventricle. At approximately the same time, Egr-1 was induced in dopaminergic and vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons in the tuberal hypothalamus and in dopaminergic neurons of the premammillary nucleus. We noted no induction in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons until 2h after dawn the following morning. Overall, our results indicate that Egr-1 responses in GnRH neurons occur rather late during photostimulation, compared with responses in other cell populations, and that such induction may reflect new synthesis related to GnRH depletion rather than stimulation by light cues.",Excluded
3043,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for jugular foramen schwannomas BACKGROUND: Jugular foramen schwannomas pose difficult management problems because of the surgical risk of lower cranial neuropathy. The indications and results of stereotactic radiosurgery are not well documented.METHODS: We reviewed our 10-year experience in the management of 17 patients who had jugular foramen schwannomas managed with the gamma knife. Thirteen patients previously had undergone surgery (range, 1-6 resections). Four patients had multiple cranial nerve deficits before microsurgical resection; 12 developed multiple lower cranial nerve palsies after resection. Four patients underwent radiosurgery based on imaging criteria alone. Conformal dose planning (tumor margin dose of 12-18 Gy) successfully encompassed the irregular tumor volumes in all patients.RESULTS: Follow-up varied from 6 to 74 months. Tumor size decreased in eight patients, remained stable in eight, and increased in one patient during the average follow-up interval of 3.5 years. Six patients improved and 10 others retained their preradiosurgery clinical status. One patient had an increase in tumor size and clinical deterioration 6 months after radiosurgery and underwent microsurgical resection. No patient developed new cranial nerve or other neurological deficits after radiosurgery.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that gamma knife radiosurgery is an effective alternative to microsurgical resection for patients who have small tumors and intact lower cranial nerve function. It is also effective for patients who have residual or recurrent tumors after microsurgical resection.",Excluded
2591,"Estimation of a minimum yearly radiation allowance (MYRA) Considerable evidence indicates that ionizing radiation is an essential agent. When reared in environments with levels of ionizing radiation below that of our background, a variety of species exhibit poor survival or reproduction. In contrast, whole body exposures to low dose irradiation increase most physiologic parameters; these include neuromuscular development, reproduction, cell repair systems, immune competence, and average lifespan. This indicates that we live in a partial deficiency of ionizing radiation. Cancer mortality rate is an important criterion to evaluate the effect of low doses of ionizing radiation. Valuable evidence is available from the deaths of nuclear workers who were exposed to low doses of radiation in energy, weapons and ship building plants. The cancer mortality rate in 120,000 exposed nuclear workers was only 63% that of 200,000 control workers in the same plants. Evidence from 8 million person-years experience indicates that low levels of ionizing radiation are beneficial. The data support the hypothesis that safe supplementation of ionizing radiation should become a public health program. The evidence supports a minimum yearly radiation allowance (MYRA) of 7 centigrey/year (cGy/y) for adult males.",Excluded

The ectodermic origin of melanocytes and the presence of melanin in the substantia nigra are the theoretic basis of the experimental use of this class of tracers for melanoma imaging.METHODS: Eleven patients with proven metastatic melanoma entered the study. Whole-body and planar scintigrams were performed 2, 4 and 24 hr after intravenous injection of a mean tracer activity of 205 MBq. The dosimetric evaluation was performed by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee method.RESULTS: The [123I]-(S)-IBZM scans allowed the detection of all six cutaneous lesions, five of six superficial pathologic lymph nodes, four of five pulmonary and one of two hepatic metastases. The maximum tumor-to-background ratio was 2.6 in planar images. The hepatobiliary excretion of the tracer may limit detection of intra-abdominal lesions. Dosimetry is similar to data for nononcologic patients.CONCLUSION: Although it is unclear if the mechanism of radiopharmaceutical uptake in melanoma is due to binding to membrane receptors or due to interactions with intracellular structures, radiolabeled benzamide is a promising tracer to detect melanoma.",Excluded
2772,"Effects on the photoresponse of calcium buffers and cyclic GMP incorporated into the cytoplasm of retinal rods It is generally accepted that the light response in retinal rods involves a reduction of ionic permeability (predominantly to Na+) in the plasma membrane of the outer segment and that this is mediated by an internal messenger which diffuses between the disk and plasma membranes. There is controversy, however, over the identity of the diffusible substance; two alternative schemes have received widespread support (for review see refs 1,2). According to the 'calcium hypothesis', light stimulates the release into the cytoplasm of calcium, leading to the blockage of channels which are normally open in darkness, whereas based on the 'cyclic nucleotide hypothesis', cyclic GMP causes the opening of channels in the dark, but is hydrolysed by a light-activated phosphodiesterase. We report here effects of introducing calcium buffers and cyclic GMP into the rod cytoplasm by means of a patch pipette, which seem to be inconsistent with the calcium hypothesis.",Excluded

Detection of the impairment was possible within 3 hrs after high doses of the irradiation (206.4-258 mCi/kg); after lower doses - within the first hour of the postirradiation period. The immunochemical procedure might be used for early biological detection of the irradiation impairments as well as for estimation of radio-sensitivity of nuclear cells to the effects of irradiation and radioprotectors.,Included

3031,"Single domain antibody (SBT-100) crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and inhibits human glioblastoma by selectively targeting KRAS and P-STAT3 Background: Glioblastoma is difficult to treat malignancy that has a high incidence of KRAS mutations ( > 90%) and hyper-expression of P-STAT3 ( > 90%). Most chemotherapeutic agents and large biologics (four chain heterotetrameric IgG) cannot cross the BBB. Therefore Singh Biotechnology's (SBT) propriety technology has developed a novel targeted therapy and engineered SBT-100 a 15 kD single domain antibody (sdAb) that is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3, which can cross the BBB to target gliablastomas. Method(s): Human glioblastoma (U87MG) cell line was used and obtained from ATCC. Biacore affinity assay was used to demonstrate SBT-100 binding to KRAS, KRAS (G12D), and STAT3. The glioblastoma cells were incubated with 0ug/ml to 200ug/ml of SBT-100. MTT assay was performed after 3 days of treatment with SBT-100 and the growth inhibition was calculated. Xenograft (athymic nude mouse) with a well established tumor growing for 6 weeks was injected with SBT-100 intraperitoneally (IP). After 15 minutes the brain of this animal was harvested for immunohistochemical staining. Result(s): Biacore studies showed SBT-100 binds KRAS with affinity constant of 10- 9M, KRAS (G12D) at 10- 8M, and STAT3 at 10- 8M. MTT assay reveals 62% (p < 0.01) growth inhibition of U87MG within 3 days. A xenograft mouse with a well established tumor ( > 150mm<sup>3</sup>), when injected IP with 5mg/kg of SBT-100 showed localization in the brain within 15 minutes. Therefore SBT-100 (sdAb) crosses the BBB, and shows intracellular localization in the animal's neurons and glial cells. Conclusion(s): SBT-100 significantly inhibits the growth of glioblastoma. KRAS mutations and/or over expression of P-STAT3 in glioblastomas are promising targets for sdAbs like SBT-100, which is bispecific for KRAS and STAT3. SBT-100 crosses the BBB and localizes within the neurons and glial cells of the brain. SBT's proprietary single domain antibody technology platform used to engineer SBT- 100 holds promise for targeting primary brain malignancies, metastatic cancers that go to the brain, and for neurologic disease amenable to targeted therapy.

3528,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for medically refractory multiple sclerosis-related tremor OBJECTIVE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that can lead to severe intention tremor in some patients. In several case reports, conventional radiotherapy has been reported to possibly exacerbate MS. Radiosurgery dramatically limits normal tissue irradiation to potentially avoid such a problem. Gamma Knife thalamotomy (GKT) has been established as a minimally invasive technique that is effective in treating essential tremor and Parkinson's disease-related tremor. The goal in this study was to analyze the outcomes of GKT in patients suffering from medically refractory MS-related tremor. METHODS The authors retrospectively studied the outcomes of 15 patients (mean age 46.5 years) who had undergone GKT over a 15-year period (1998-2012). Fourteen patients underwent GKT at a median maximum dose of 140 Gy (range 130-150 Gy) using a single 4-mm isocenter. One patient underwent GKT at a dose of 140 Gy delivered via two 4-mm isocenters (3 mm apart). The posteroinferior region of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (VIM) was the target for all GKTs. The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale was used to evaluate tremor, handwriting, drawing, and drinking. The median time to the last follow-up was 39 months. RESULTS After GKT, 13 patients experienced tremor improvement on the side contralateral to surgery. Four patients noted tremor arrest at a median of 4.5 months post-GKT. Seven patients had excellent tremor improvement and 6 had good tremor improvement. Four patients noted excellent functional improvement, 8 noted good functional improvement, and 1 noted satisfactory functional improvement. Three patients experienced diminished tremor relief at a median of 18 months after radiosurgery. Two patients experienced temporary adverse radiation effects. Another patient developed a large thalamic cyst 60 months after GKT, which was successfully managed with Ommaya reservoir placement.

Since the first study was published in 1970, only eight major epidemiologic studies have been done that attempted to identify risk factors for meningioma. Ionizing radiation and head trauma have emerged as the most promising etiologic risk factors. In these studies, radiation doses as low as 1-2 Gy have been associated with increased risk. The role of dental radiographs has been suggested in some studies but not supported in others. An explanation for the apparent excess of meningiomas in women remains obscure. The potential effects of endogenous or exogenous sex hormones on tumor induction or growth remain unexplored in epidemiologic studies.

3179,"Determining elemental tissue composition from dual energy cone-beam CT using principal component analysis and a shallow neural network Purpose: Due to the use of kV photon beams in small animal radiotherapy, the dose deposition is strongly dependent on the elemental tissue composition. We present a novel method to extract continuous elemental tissue compositions from dual energy CBCT (DE-CBCT) images. Method(s): We use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the material space. For each DE-CBCT image, we first classify individual voxels as air, soft tissue, or bone through a support vector machine. In a next step, a shallow neural network determines the weights of the principal components. All images were acquired on the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (XStrahl Ltd). The DE-CBCT imaging protocol was optimised over a range of energy and tin filter combinations. The model is calibrated on a mousesized solid water phantom with 10 tissue-equivalent material inserts with known elemental composition. We validate the model on a second phantom with 6 different tissue-equivalent inserts, and compare the predictions to a conventional PCA method with a linear regression model. We additionally apply the new method to a mouse DE-CBCT. Result(s): The material composition in the 6 inserts of the validation phantom was extracted with a mean squared error of 1%, averaged over all inserts. This is an improvement over conventional PCA methods without a neural network (3% average mean squared error), especially for bony tissues. While no ground truth is available for the mouse tissues, we found good agreement with the composition from the material database, for instance within 3% for the mouse brain. Conclusion(s): We presented a novel method to extract the elemental tissue composition from DE-CBCT images.

To conclude our studies of neurodegeneration in rat CNS during ACR neurotoxicity, a cupric silver stain method was used to define spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell body, dendrite, axon and terminal argyrophilia in forebrain regions and nuclei. Rats were exposed to ACR at a dose-rate of either 50 mg/kg per day (i.p.) or 21 mg/kg per day (p.o.) and at selected times brains were removed and processed for silver staining. Results show that intoxication at either ACR dose-rate produced a terminalopathy, i.e. nerve terminal degeneration and swelling were present in the absence of significant argyrophilic changes in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites or axons. Exposure to the higher ACR dose-rate caused early onset (day 5), widespread nerve terminal degeneration in most of the major forebrain areas, e.g. cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia. At the lower dose-rate, nerve terminal degeneration in the forebrain developed early (day 7) but exhibited a relatively limited spatial distribution, i.e. anteroventral thalamic nucleus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Several hippocampal regions were affected at a later time point (day 28), i.e. CA1 field and subicular complex. At both dose-rates, argyrophilic changes in forebrain nerve terminals developed prior to the onset of significant gait abnormalities. Thus, in forebrain, ACR intoxication produced a pure terminalopathy that developed prior to the onset of significant neurological changes and progressed as a function of exposure. Neither dose-rate used in this study was associated with axon degeneration in any forebrain region. Our findings indicate that nerve terminals were selectively affected in forebrain areas and, therefore, might be primary sites of ACR action.",Excluded

3157,"Myelin repair by Schwann cells in the regenerating goldfish visual pathway: regional patterns revealed by X-irradiation In the regenerating goldfish optic nerves, Schwann cells of unknown origin reliably infiltrate the lesion site forming a band of peripheral-type myelinating tissue by 1-2 months, sharply demarcated from the adjacent new CNS myelin. To investigate this effect, we have interfered with cell proliferation by locally X-irradiating the fish visual pathway 24h after the lesion. As assayed by immunohistochemistry and EM, irradiation retards until 6 months formation of new myelin by Schwann cells at the lesion site, and virtually abolishes oligodendrocyte myelination distally, but has little or no effect on nerve fibre regrowth. Optic nerve astrocyte processes normally fail to re-infiltrate the lesion, but re-occupy it after irradiation, suggesting that they are normally excluded by early cell proliferation at this site. Moreover, scattered myelinating Schwann cells also appear in the oligodendrocyte-depleted distal optic nerve after irradiation, although only as far as the optic tract. Optic nerve reticular astrocytes differ in various ways from radial glia elsewhere in the fish CNS, and our observations suggest that they may be more permissive to Schwann cell invasion of CNS tissue.",Included

Patients received radiotherapy or chemoradiation with temozolomide. The prognostic significance of marital status was assessed. Disease complications, toxicity, and treatment delivery were evaluated in detail.RESULTS: Overall survival was significantly higher in married than in unmarried patients (median, 7.9 vs. 4.0 months; p = 0.006). The prognostic significance of marital status was preserved in the multivariate analysis (HR, 0.41; p = 0.011). Married patients could receive significantly higher daily temozolomide doses (mean, 53.7 mg/m2 vs. 33.1 mg/m2; p = 0.020), were more likely to receive maintenance temozolomide (45.7 % vs. 11.8 %; p = 0.016), and had to be hospitalized less frequently during radiotherapy (55.0 % vs. 88.2 %; p = 0.016). Of the patients receiving temozolomide, married patients showed significantly lower rates of hematologic and liver toxicity. Most complications were infectious or neurologic in nature. Complications of any grade were more frequent in unmarried patients (58.8 % vs. 30.0 %; p = 0.041) with the incidence of grade 3-5 complications being particularly elevated (47.1 % vs. 15.0 %; p = 0.004).CONCLUSION: We found poorer treatment delivery as well as an unexpected severe increase in toxicity and disease complications in elderly unmarried glioblastoma patients.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an iterative-reconstruction algorithm, ASIR, on image-quality measures in reduced-dose head CT scans for adult patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a 64-section scanner, we analyzed 100 reduced-dose adult head CT scans at 6 predefined levels of ASIR blended with FBP reconstruction. These scans were compared with 50 CT scans previously obtained at a higher routine dose without ASIR reconstruction. SNR and CNR were computed from Hounsfield unit measurements of normal GM and WM of brain parenchyma. A blinded qualitative analysis was performed in 10 lower-dose CT datasets compared with higher-dose ones without ASIR. Phantom data analysis was also performed. RESULT(S): Lower-dose scans without ASIR had significantly lower mean GM and WM SNR (P = .003) and similar GM-WM CNR values compared with higher routine-dose scans. However, at ASIR levels of 20%-40%, there was no statistically significant difference in SNR, and at ASIR levels of >=60%, the SNR values of the reduced-dose scans were significantly higher (P < .01). CNR values were also significantly higher at ASIR levels of >=40% (P < .01). Blinded qualitative review demonstrated significant improvements in perceived image noise, artifacts, and GM-WM differentiation at ASIR levels >=60% (P < .01).

3262,"Repeated cycles of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) - Results and side-effects of the radioisotope <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA TATE, <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA TATE or <sup>90</sup>Y/<sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA TATE therapy in patients with disseminated NET Purpose: PRRT is a known tool in the management of patients with disseminated and inoperable NETs. The aim of study was to assess the effectiveness of the repeated cycles of PRRT in patients with disseminated and inoperable NETs. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty nine patients were included in the PRRT. Among them 16 patients (18%) were qualified for a repeated PRRT cycle due to progression of the disease. In one of the patients qualified for the repeated cycle, PRRT was used as neoadjuvant therapy. The results and side-effects of the repeated cycles of PRRT were analyzed. Result(s): Disease stabilization was observed in 10 patients 6 months after the repeated PRRT cycle and in 5 patients after 12 and 18 months. Ten of the patients who had received repeated PRRT cycles died. In the case of neoadjuvant therapy, further reduction of the tumor size was observed, enabling qualification for surgery. Clinically significant reduction in the mean values of morphological parameters was not observed. Only after 12 and 18 months the mean values of creatinine levels were higher than the normal range (only in 2 patients). Conclusion(s): The repeated cycles of PRRT did not cause a clinically significant increase of the toxicity of PRRT. The changes in kidney and blood morphology parameters were transient. The repeated cycles of PRRT enabled stabilization of the disease. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3591,"Octopamine modulates photoreceptor function in the Limulus lateral eye Activity at night in efferent nerve fibers from a central circadian clock produces changes in photoreceptor function in the lateral compound eye of Limulus: the response to light is increased; membrane potential fluctuations (bumps) occurring in the dark are suppressed; and the duration of bumps occurring both in the dark and under dim illumination is increased (Barlow et al., 1977; Kaplan & Barlow, 1980; Barlow, 1983; Barlow et al., 1985). Efferent nerve terminals release octopamine when activated (Battelle et al., 1982; Battelle & Evans, 1984, 1986); exogenous octopamine in vitro produces some of the changes resulting from efferent nerve activity in vivo (Kass et al., 1988). We report here that the increase in both on-transient and steady-state response to light induced by octopamine in the lateral eye in vitro are concentration dependent with threshold at or below 100 nM, saturation at or above 100 microM, and half-maximal increase in the range 1-10 microM. Octopamine also reduces bump activity in the dark in a concentration-dependent way. Unlike the increase in light response, the dependence of this effect on octopamine concentration is extremely variable from specimen to specimen. The effects of exogenous octopamine on light response and bump activity can sometimes be reversed by removing octopamine from the medium bathing the in vitro preparation. Octopamine also increases bump duration, apparently in a concentration-dependent manner. We have not succeeded in reversing this increase in bump duration. The concentration dependence of changes in photoreceptor response described here agrees qualitatively with the dependence of cAMP levels on octopamine in Limulus photoreceptors (Kaupp et al., 1982), lending further support to the idea that cAMP acts as a second messenger in the circadian control of photoreceptor function. Our results also suggest that the changes induced in the transient and steady-state response to light by both efferent nerve activity and exogenous octopamine have a common origin, which may differ from that responsible for the modulation of bump activity.",Excluded

2862,"Long thoracic and spinal accessory nerve injury after an esophagectomy: A unusual case report of scapular winging Patients or Programs: A 54-year-old right-handed man with a history of esophageal cancer treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and esophagectomy. Program Description: The patient was referred to the clinic by his oncologist for evaluation of bilateral shoulder pain. He had recently undergone esophagectomy with right thoracotomy. Before surgery, the patient had no shoulder pain; after surgery, he developed severe pain and restricted range of motion in the bilateral shoulders, worse on the right side. He had difficulty with overhead reaching and use of his right upper limb in activities of daily living. On examination, he was noted to have significant winging of the right scapula along the medial border when at rest and with a wall pushup, an inability to forward flex the right shoulder past 80degree and abduct past 70degree, atrophy of the right posterior shoulder girdle, and a large well-healed scar along the right lateral scapular border. Setting(s): Outpatient musculoskeletal clinic. Result(s): An electromyography and nerve conduction study was performed and revealed both long thoracic and spinal accessory neuropathy. Subsequent ultrasound imaging of the shoulder revealed a neuroma deep to the scar in the right mid axillary line, suspicious for a laceration of the long thoracic nerve. The patient was referred to the orthotics department to be fitted for a scapulothoracic orthosis. Discussion(s): Although rare, scapular winging can present after surgery due to traumatic, iatrogenic, or idiopathic factors. Prior studies have shown that postoperative scapular winging can have a neurogenic etiology, with isolated injury to the long thoracic, spinal accessory, or dorsal scapular nerve. In this unusual case, the patient developed injury to a combination of nerves, which led his symptoms. Conclusion(s): Postoperative scapular winging can be associated with concomitant long thoracic and spinal accessory nerve injury.",Excluded
3526,"A High Affinity Red Fluorescence and Colorimetric Probe for Amyloid beta Aggregates A major challenge in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) is its timely diagnosis. Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates have been proposed as the most viable biomarker for the diagnosis of AD. Here, we demonstrate hemicyanine-based benzothiazole-coumarin (TC) as a potential probe for the detection of highly toxic Abeta42 aggregates through switch-on, enhanced (~30 fold) red fluorescence (Emax = 654 nm) and characteristic colorimetric (light red to purple) optical outputs. Interestingly, TC exhibits selectivity towards Abeta42 fibrils compared to other abnormal protein aggregates. TC probe show nanomolar binding affinity (Ka = 1.72 x 10(7) M(-1)) towards Abeta42 aggregates and also displace ThT bound to Abeta42 fibrils due to its high binding affinity. The Abeta42 fibril-specific red-shift in the absorption spectra of TC responsible for the observed colorimetric optical output has been attributed to micro-environment change around the probe from hydrophilic-like to hydrophobic-like nature. The binding site, binding energy and changes in optical properties observed for TC upon interaction with Abeta42 fibrils have been further validated by molecular docking and time dependent density functional theory studies.",Excluded
3497,"Possible fractionated regimens for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy of large arteriovenous malformations The aim of this study was to estimate a plausible alpha/beta ratio for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) based on reported clinical data, and to design possible fractionation regimens suitable for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) for large AVMs based on the newly obtained alpha/beta ratio. The commonly used obliteration rate (OR) for AVMs with a three year angiographic follow-up from many institutes was fitted to linear-quadratic (LQ) formalism and the Poisson OR model. The determined parameters were then used to calculate possible fractionation regimens for IG-IMRT based on the concept of a biologically effective dose (BED) and an equivalent uniform dose (EUD). The radiobiological analysis yields a alpha/beta ratio of 2.2 +/- 1.6 Gy for AVMs. Three sets of possible fractionated schemes were designed to achieve equal or better biological effectiveness than the single-fraction treatments while maintaining the same probability of normal brain complications. A plausible alpha/beta ratio was derived for AVMs and possible fractionation regimens that may be suitable for IG-IMRT for large AVM treatment are proposed. The sensitivity of parameters on the calculation was also studied. The information may be useful to design new clinical trials that use IG-IMRT for the treatment of large AVMs. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Excluded

3452,"Indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and its application In mitochondria, ATP synthesis is coupled to oxygen consumption by the proton electrochemical gradient established across the mitochondrial inner membrane in a process termed oxidative phosphorylation. It has long been known from stoichiometric studies that ATP synthesis is not perfectly coupled to oxygen consumption. The major inefficiency in the system is leakage of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane driven by the proton electrochemical gradient. The kinetics of the proton leak can be determined indirectly, by measuring the oxygen consumption of mitochondria under non-phosphorylating conditions (plus oligomycin) as a function of the proton electrochemical gradient. This experimental system provides a convenient means to investigate inner membrane permeability to protons and the effect of factors that may effect that permeability. In this paper we review some results from our laboratory of indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and how it has been applied to investigate the effect of aging, obesity and thyroid status on proton leak. The results show that (i) proton leak in isolated liver mitochondria is not significantly different in a comparison of young and old rats, in contrast (ii) there is an apparent increase in proton leak in in situ mitochondria in hepatocytes from old rats when compared to those from young rats, (iii) proton leak in neuronal mitochondria in situ in synaptosomes is not significantly different in young and old rats, (iv) proton leak is greater in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice compared to lean controls, (v) acute leptin (OB protein) administration restores the increased leak rate in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice to that of lean controls, (vi) administration of thyroid hormone (T3) increases proton leak in rat muscle mitochondria, and (vii) proton leak in muscle mitochondria is insensitive to the presence of GDP. It is proposed that the experimental system described here for measuring proton leak, is an ideal functional assay for determining whether the novel uncoupling proteins increase inner membrane permeability to protons.",Excluded
